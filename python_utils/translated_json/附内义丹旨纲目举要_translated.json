  "full_translation": "**The Inner Essentials of the *Supreme Origin: The Most Wondrous Scripture for Transcending Measure and Attaining the Highest Rank***\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Inner Essentials of the Supreme Origin: The Most Wondrous Scripture for Transcending Measure and Attaining the Highest Rank*\nComposed by the Southern Song Daoist Xiao Yingshou. Five volumes.\nSource text: *The Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* (Vital Perfection) Section, *Yujue* (Jade Precepts) Category.\n\n**The Concise Outline of the Inner Essentials and the Core Intent of the Elixir**\nDisciple Mei Yan Lin Yuanding, surnamed Zhengfu, records the essentials.\n\nThe sacred text of *Lingbao* is the very utterance of the Great Sage, the Supreme Origin Heavenly Venerable, who imparted it to the Jade Dawn Dao Lord. Within the scripture, reference is made to the *Middle Chapter of the Ling Book*, which is the Jade Dawn Dao Lord expounding upon what he had received from the Supreme Origin. Though the words differ, the Dao is one.\n\nAs Master Guanfu observed in *The Mystic Resonance of the Inner Essentials and the Elixir’s Intent*:\nIt comprises thirty-one chapters.\n\nThe Supreme Origin Great Luo Heavenly Person is the *Ancestral Qi*.\nThe Dao Lord of the Western Na Kingdom is the *Golden Mother*.\nThe Most Venerable Laozi, the utmost essence of primal birth and the most refined manifestation of form, is the *Elixir Body*.\nAll are the true nature of the self—never separate entities.\n\nTo scrutinize these words is to penetrate all things, revealing truths unattested by former sages. This is not achieved through empty speculation but through earnest practice alone.\n\nYet the varied names invoked may perplex the student.\nFor instance: *Geng-Tiger, Jia-Dragon*, *Sun-Soul, Moon-Spirit*, *Red Lead, Black Tin*, *Cinnabar, Vermilion Mercury*—though all are the primal *Yi-qi*, how could one not be bewildered upon first encounter?\n\nWithout fear of error, I, Yuanding, merge disparate terms into a coherent outline, neither augmenting nor fabricating, but simply transmitting what I received from the Master in plain terms. The prose lacks poetic grace, yet the principles are clear—serving not only to elucidate the Master’s teachings but also to dispel the student’s doubts.\n\n---\n**Ancestral Qi**\nThe primal, void, and naturally arising Ancestral Qi—\nIn the scripture, it is called the *Void Sovereign, Supreme Origin Heavenly Venerable*;\nIn the human body, it is the *Uncorrupted Primordial Spirit of past kalpas*;\nIn elixir practice, it is the *Void Qi, Golden Embryo*.\n\nIt is also called *Golden Mother, Silver Essence, Silver Furnace, Yang Essence, Elixir Body*.\nWhen its transformative mechanism converges in the central palace, it is termed *Elixir Mother, Elixir Foundation*;\nWhen it is imbued by the wondrous transformative Qi and takes form, it is called *Dark Pearl, Sacred Embryo, Infant*.\n\nAs in the *Lingbao Scripture*: *\"The Mixed Void, Crimson Text, Primordial Cavern, Jade Calendar\"*—\nIn elixir practice, this is *True Lead*, within which lies *Silver*.\nIt is the one true spirit of humanity, within which resides the spirit.\n\n---\n**True Lead**\nTrue Lead is the spirit within nature, the *yang within yin*.\nAs in the *Paramount Concordance*: *\"The *kan* essence of the fifth month\"*;\nAs in the *Awakening to Reality*: *\"Bearing yin yet embracing yang-soul\"*—\nIn material terms, it is *silver within lead*;\nIn the Five Phases, it is *gold within water*;\nIn the human body, it is *spirit within nature*.\nThough named in myriad ways, it does not depart from the one essence.\n\nIf one returns to the root and seeks the source, the principle is not distant.\nAs the *Lingbao Scripture* states:\n*\"The Mixed Void, Crimson Text—\nThe peerless True One,\nThe Supreme Origin’s ancestral kalpa,\nGiving rise to all heavens,\nIlluminating the three luminaries—\nThis is the Heavenly Root,\nAll originating from the Ancestral Qi.\"*\n\nYet the varied names—*Golden Official, Wu-Soil, Black Tiger, Yellow Sprout, White Snow*—are but alternate designations for Lead.\nIn essence, they are the *original face*.\nNow, I clarify for fellow students: it is simply the one true nature of humanity.\n\nNature arises from the void, from empty Qi descending into substance—\nJust as lead emerges from silver ore,\nAnd water generates from gold.\n\nAs the *Book of Transformation* says: *\"Void transforms beyond the spirit\"*—\nThese are idle words; do not waste thought upon them.\nThe scripture states:\n*\"The Dao gives birth to One;*\n*Again, it says: Obtain the One, and all things are complete.*\nThis One is the truth.\n\nAs the *Lingbao: Law of the Cosmic Region* declares:\n*\"The Ancestral Qi of the Supreme Origin—\nBefore form, how shall it be likened?\nIf one knows this, what difficulty is there in likening it?\"*\n\n---\n**True Mercury**\nTrue Mercury is not the post-heaven yin-mingled substance but the primal Ancestral Qi.\nEach day, it arises anew as the yang-qi ascends, interacting with the Lead-qi to congeal—\nCoarsely termed *cinnabar*.\nWhen the yang reaches its peak and the yin descends, it is called *\"extracting mercury from cinnabar.\"*\nMercury is the *yin within yang*.\n\nAs in the *Paramount Concordance*: *\"The radiance of the self’s sun\"*;\nAs in the *Awakening to Reality*: *\"The雄 containing the雌 within\"*—\nIn material terms, it is *mercury within cinnabar*;\nIn the Five Phases, it is *fire generated by wood*;\nIn the human body, it is *Qi taking form*.\nThough named differently, it is the same Qi.\n\nIf one returns to the source and aligns with the root, the elixir is complete.\nAs the *Lingbao Scripture* states:\n*\"The Great Movement of the Dharmic Qi,\nCirculating through the ten directions,\nThe Dharmic Qi of the Pralaya,\nUnfolding myriad patterns.\"*\n\nNames such as *Zhan-Nü, Vermilion Dragon, Flowing Pearl, QuickSilver, Ji-Soil* are but alternate designations for Mercury—\nCollectively termed *medicinal substances*.\nNow, I clarify for fellow students: it is simply the *Qi of the yang-essence’s emergence*.\n\nQi arises from the spirit’s transformation, interacting and generating sentiment—\nJust as cinnabar forms from lead,\nMercury is extracted from cinnabar,\nWater generates wood,\nAnd fire arises from wood.\n\nTo seek the Dao beyond this is to incite emotional attachment.\nAs the *Book of Transformation* says: *\"The spirit transforms into Qi.\"*\nThe scripture states:\n*\"One gives birth to Two; Two gives birth to Three—*\nThis is the truth.\n\nAs the *Law of the Cosmic Region* says:\n*\"Transforming to produce all treasures,\nDescending into substance as Qi—\nIn this world, what form does it take?\nIf one knows this, what difficulty is there in embodying it?\"*\n\n---\n**Return and Reversion**\nLead and Mercury are, in truth, of one source—\nJust as lead arises from silver,\nCinnabar forms from lead,\nAnd mercury is extracted from cinnabar—\nThis is the principle of material nature.\n\nJust as water generates from gold,\nWater nurtures wood,\nAnd fire arises from wood—\nThis is the workings of creation.\n\n**Return and Reversion**\n\nCinnabar and mercury mutually resonate—\nWhen lead is added, silver is formed;\nWood and fire oppose each other—\nWhen earth is generated, gold arises—\nThis illustrates how within the human body, the *Dao* manifests as *qi* from emptiness,\nCondensing into substance and thus taking form—\nThis is called *xing-qi* (性炁).\n\nFrom *xing* forming and moving, *qing* (情) arises;\nWhen *xing* governs *qing*, and *qing* returns to *xing*,\nThe return to emptiness is achieved—\nThis is the principle of *return and reversion*.\n\nYet common folk, unaware of the Dao’s essence,\nConfuse *xing* with *qing*,\nAnd from *qing* derive *shi* (识);\nOnce *qing* and *shi* are stirred,\nThe original *xing* is lost.\n\nLittle do they know that *shen* (神) and *qi* (炁),\nAs well as *xing* (性) and *qing* (情),\nAre all but the empty primordial *qi*,\nDescending into form and artificially named—\nThe adept can unite with this through innate roots,\nReceived by the teacher’s oral transmission and mental guidance,\nAnd thus return to its origin.\n\nWhat is called *roots* (根) is, in truth, no separate thing—\nIt is simply *xing* and *shen* (神性).\nWhen it abides according to time within the inner chambers,\nIt is called *wu-tu* (戊土), known as *xing*.\nWhen one *qi* circulates and interacts, generating mutual excitation,\nIt is called *ji-tu* (己土), known as *qing*.\nWhen *xing* governs *qing*, and *qing* returns to *xing*,\nThen *being* and *non-being* intermingle,\nHidden and revealed align,\nEmpty and substantial harmonize,\nMovement and stillness nourish one another—\nAnd thus the cinnabar essence is perfected.\n\nThis is called *chun-qian* (纯乾), or *xuan-ti* (玄体).\n*Chun-qian* refers to the firm, robust, and upright essence—\nPure, refined, and subtle.\n*Xuan-ti* refers to the gathering into form when condensed,\nAnd the returning to *qi* when dispersed—\nOnly at this point can one truly speak of the Dao of *golden elixir return*.\n\nAs the *Paramartha Contract* says:\n*\"When gold returns to its nature, it is then called cinnabar.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Kan flows into Wu, Li adheres to Ji.\"*\n\nAs the *Awakening to True Scripture* says:\n*\"Take the real essence of the Kan position in the heart,\nTransform it through the Li palace in the abdomen’s Yin—\nFrom this arises the pure, robust body,\nHidden yet capable of flight—all by the mind’s will.\"*\n\nThus, in accordance with these teachings,\nThe scriptural principles of *tilting light to return to the chariot*,\n*Overseeing the True to guide rebirth*,\n*Commanding the Earthly Devas*,\nAnd *attending and escorting*—\nAll align without contradiction.\n\nAs the *Law of the Cosmic Region* says:\n*\"When this *qi* is further refined and transformed,\nIt becomes the elixir that leads to transcendence—\nThe principle is thus revealed.\"*\n\n**The Dao of Golden Elixir**\nThe Dao of the golden elixir requires only that one\n*Perceive nature and clarify the mind*,\n*Return to the root and restore the vital essence*,\n*Restore its original state*,\nAnd *revert to emptiness*—\nThis is called the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is that which,\nThough unseen by sight, is never absent,\nAnd though unheard by ear, is never silent—\nIt transcends all boundaries.\n\nThough it cannot be seen or heard,\nThe Dao is never truly absent—\nThis is the principle of *inner symbolism*:\n*\"The substance is hidden within the form,\nThe form is void yet contains the essence.\"*\n\nIf scholars fail to deeply grasp this,\nSome say it *is*,\nSome say it *is not*,\nSome say it *seems to be yet seems not*,\nSome say it is *neither being nor non-being*—\nAll are mistaken.\n\nLet me explain:\nThe external teachings and separate methods\nAll take lead and mercury as *yin* and *yang*,\nAnd vital essence as medicinal substance,\nThe mouth and nostrils as the *Mysterious Feminine*,\nThe heart and kidneys as *Kan* and *Li*.\n\nWith bellows and tripods competing in their operations,\nRed and purple distinctions are blurred—\nTheir confusion and errors are countless.\n\nHow could they know that when *qing* and *shi* are stirred,\nThis is the *vital spirit and essence*?\nWhen one disturbs the *vital spirit and essence*,\nThe original *xing* is lost—\nIf *xing* is obscured, where is the Dao?\n\nThus the *Buddhist teachings* say:\n*\"Those who study the Dao yet fail to recognize the True,\nMerely chase after the *shen* (神) from the start—\nThrough countless kalpas, they remain bound to birth and death,\nWhile fools call this the ‘original body.’\"*\nThis is precisely the case.\n\nThe Dao of the golden elixir has\n*A foundation and a root*,\n*A body and a function*—\nOnce the original *xing* is clarified,\nThe mind is pure and the emotions are tranquil.\n\nAs our *Confucian scholars* say:\n*\"Rectify the heart and sincerely intend,\nExtend knowledge and investigate things,\nSubdue the self and return to propriety,\nReflect upon oneself and achieve sincerity—\nHow could this be external to the Dao?\"*\n\nWhen applied to serving the ruler,\nIt manifests as *loyalty*;\nWhen applied to honoring parents,\nIt manifests as *filial piety*;\nWhen applied to interacting with others,\nIt manifests as *sincerity*;\nWhen applied to cultivating oneself,\nIt manifests as *rectitude*.\n\nIt harmonizes with the Void and unites with the Non-existent,\nEver-clear and ever-still,\nTrue emptiness and wondrous being,\nPiercing emptiness and complete penetration—\nThus the *Supreme Sage* says:\n*\"Artificially named, it is called the Dao.\"*\nWhat is called *elixir*, then, is but what?\n\nAs the *Awakening to True Scripture* says:\n*\"Further, one must investigate the root of nature above,\nAnd resolve the wondrous, non-arising function—\nIf one attains this, then all that inner symbolism reveals\nWill be pure jade, without variation in hue.\"*\n\nThis aligns with the *Heavenly Emperor’s Jade True, Colorless* state,\nAnd the *Dharma of the Vimalakirti* (景梵行).\n\nAs the *Odes* say:\n*\"The Heavenly One’s carriage moves without sound or scent—\nThis is the ultimate sincerity.\"*\n\nThe scripture says:\n*\"Profound wisdom pierces clarity,\nImmense capacity is the deepest mystery—\nThis is the ultimate truth.\"*\n\nAh! It is complete.\n\n**Releasing the Mysterious Diagram of the Supreme Extremity’s Marvelous Transformation and Divine Unity**\nThe *Diagram of the Supreme Extremity* was created by Master Lu Xi (濂溪先生),\nIlluminating the profound mysteries of creation\nAnd transmitting the unspoken secrets of the ancient sages.\n\n**Releasing the Mysterious Diagram of the Supreme Extremity’s Marvelous Transformation and Divine Unity**\n\n**Releasing the Diagram of the Body’s Symbolic Representation**\nThis diagram is called *Inner Symbol* (内象), metaphorically depicting within the human body the joints and vessels, the crucibles and chambers. Practitioners of the *Inner Elixir* (丹) must thoroughly comprehend this diagram, for only then will they grasp the foundation of the *Crucible’s Symbolic Setting* (炉鼎设象) and the source of the *Lead and Mercury’s Return to the Origin* (铅汞归元). The vital chambers and their mysteries are of utmost solemnity—one must not dare to casually divulge them. Yet Master Lu has already revealed its essential principles within the diagram itself. Those of wisdom who study the scriptures will surely gain insights from it.\n\n**Releasing the Diagram of the Great Return’s Heart-Mirror and Fire Refining**\nMaster Lu expounded upon the *Heart-Mirror and Fire Refining* (大还心镜火候图) of the *Peng True Person* (彭真人), elucidating the profound applications of the *Hidden Language* (隐语). Who beneath the heavens can fully fathom this unless they are the most enlightened?\n\nSome may ask: \"Does not all the logic beneath the heavens ultimately return to One? Yet the *Hidden Language* speaks of sixty-four *Hexagrams* (卦) above, and twelve *Hexagrams* (卦) repeated below—why is this so?\"\n\nThe reply is: \"Have you not seen Master’s words? The *Hexagrams* of the *Hidden Language* above, marked by *Jiazi* (甲子), are the *Scripture* (经); the *Hexagrams* below, detailing seasonal nodes and the sun’s shadow (节候时晷), are the *Canon’s Subtext* (纬). The distinction between *Scripture* and *Subtext* is clear—what cause for doubt remains?\n\nWhat is called *Scripture* (经) is the *Dragon-Tiger Scripture* (《龙虎经》), wherein it is said:\n*\"Water and fire each occupy their own domain,\nGuarding boundaries to produce cold and heat.\"*\n\nBy dividing the heavens as *Scripture*—north and south—\nIt aligns with the *Yijing*’s *\"The Celestial is exalted, the Terrestrial is humble,\nThe *Hexagrams* of *Qian* and *Kun* are established\"* (《易》天尊地卑、乾坤定矣).\n\nWhat is called *Subtext* (纬) is the *Scripture*’s explanation of:\n*\"East and west display the virtues of *Ren* and *Yi*,\nThe Five Phases transform into the Four Seasons.\"*\n\nBy weaving the heavens and earth as *Subtext*—east and west—\nIt corresponds to the *Yijing*’s *\"The sun and moon move in their courses,\nAlternating cold and heat\"* (日月运行、一寒一暑).\n\nThe *Awakening to True Scripture* (《悟真篇》) states:\n*\"First, grasp *Qian* and *Kun* as the crucibles,\nThen, use the *U-Fu* (乌兔) elixir to refine them.\"*\n\nThis is why the *Scripture* and *Subtext* are distinguished.\nYet their meanings are the same, their words differ—\nScholars cannot help but question,\nSo now I clarify it.\n\nThe third ring of the *Heart Mirror*—the thirty waxing and waning cycles—\nis indeed the thirty days of a month.\n\nBy excluding the *Hexagrams* of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* (the Four Pillars as crucibles and elixir ingredients),\nand using the remaining sixty *Hexagrams*,\neach day governs two *Hexagrams* in direct succession,\nthus encompassing the sixty *Hexagrams* of the *Ganzzi* (甲子) cycle over thirty days.\n\nThe fourth ring—one hundred black and white *qi* points—\nis the one hundred *ke* (刻) of a day.\n\nBy arranging these one hundred *qi* points above the thirty days,\nand preserving the cycle of a month returning to a day,\nthe *Ganzzi* (甲子) of the upper *Hexagram* in *The Hidden Words* (*《隐语》*) is thus established.\n\nThe fifth and sixth rings—twenty-four *qi* (炁) and twelve *Chen* (辰)—\nare what the Master previously linked to the lower portion of *The Hidden Words*,\nto elucidate the alternating cycles of cold and heat,\nthe swift return of years to months,\nand the swift return of months to days.\n\nThe seventh and eighth rings,\nwhich gather and harmonize the Five Phases,\nand integrate the Four Symbols into the Central Palace (*中宫*),\nwhere they interweave and generate to form the essence of the *Dan* (丹),\nare what the Master revealed in the lower section of *The Hidden Words*\nregarding the eight upper *Hexagrams*.\n\nIf scholars merely split the third ring of the *Heart Mirror*—the eclipse of waxing and waning—\nat the midpoint and extend it straight,\nthis is the upper and lower *Ganzzi* (甲子) of *The Hidden Words*.\n\nIf they bend it and round it,\nit becomes the *Great Return Heart Mirror Fire Refining Diagram* (*《大还心镜火候图》*).\n\nIf they erect it vertically,\nit aligns with the diagrams of the body’s symbols and analogies;\nthe profound subtleties of its principles become evident,\nhow profound and wondrous!\nWhat more could scholars doubt?\n\nThe Master’s elucidation of the *Scripture*’s essence\nand alignment with the *Dan* mechanism,\nmarked by *The Taiji Diagram* (*《太极图》*) at the beginning of the text,\nand the *Heart Mirror Diagram* (*《心镜图》*) summarized at its conclusion,\nserves to clarify the Dao of form and function,\nand to reveal the principles of generation and transformation.\n\nYet scholars, following its traces, often find contradictions.\nThe *Yuan Ding* (元鼎) now further clarifies this for you.\n\n*The Taiji Diagram* (*《太极图》*)\nilluminates the origin of lead and mercury as one,\nthus moving from inner to outer,\nfrom non-being to being.\n\n*The Heart Mirror Diagram* (*《心镜图》*)\nilluminates the return of lead and mercury to their origin,\nmoving from outer to inner,\nfrom being to non-being.\n\nThe *Scripture* begins with a unified principle,\nform and function are in harmony,\nexhausting the mysteries of creation’s mechanisms,\nleaving no further essence.\n\nThe practice of refining one’s body and attaining the *Dan* is complete here.\n\n**Core Essence and Alchemical Principles (内义丹旨纲目举要)**\nThis book by Master Mei Yan (梅岩) is concise and clear.\nEven *The Golden Key of Great Return* (*《还丹金钥匙》*) and *The Red Lead Black Tiger Treatise* (*《红铅黑虎论》*)\ncannot match its simplicity.\n\nPlacing it at the beginning,\nscholars need not ask the way of a roadside boy or child\nto reach the *Zhuoquzi* (具茨) mountain\nand behold the Great Yuan (大隗).\n\nThis is the teaching of Master Guanfu (观复) and the book by Xiao Yingshou (萧应叟).",

do not waste thought upon them.\nThe scripture states:\n*\"The Dao gives birth to One;*\n*Again, it says: Obtain the One, and all things are complete.*\nThis One is the truth.\n\nAs the *Lingbao: Law of the Cosmic Region* declares:\n*\"The Ancestral Qi of the Supreme Origin—\nBefore form, how shall it be likened?\nIf one knows this, what difficulty is there in likening it?\"*\n\n---\n**True Mercury**\nTrue Mercury is not the post-heaven yin-mingled substance but the primal Ancestral Qi.\nEach day, it arises anew as the yang-qi ascends, interacting with the Lead-qi to congeal—\nCoarsely termed *cinnabar*.\nWhen the yang reaches its peak and the yin descends, it is called *\"extracting mercury from cinnabar.\"*\nMercury is the *yin within yang*.\n\nAs in the *Paramount Concordance*: *\"The radiance of the self’s sun\"*;\nAs in the *Awakening to Reality*: *\"The雄 containing the雌 within\"*—\nIn material terms, it is *mercury within cinnabar*;\nIn the Five Phases, it is *fire generated by wood*;\nIn the human body, it is *Qi taking form*.\nThough named differently, it is the same Qi.\n\nIf one returns to the source and aligns with the root, the elixir is complete.\nAs the *Lingbao Scripture* states:\n*\"The Great Movement of the Dharmic Qi,\nCirculating through the ten directions,\nThe Dharmic Qi of the Pralaya,\nUnfolding myriad patterns.\"*\n\nNames such as *Zhan-Nü, Vermilion Dragon, Flowing Pearl, QuickSilver, Ji-Soil* are but alternate designations for Mercury—\nCollectively termed *medicinal substances*.\nNow, I clarify for fellow students: it is simply the *Qi of the yang-essence’s emergence*.\n\nQi arises from the spirit’s transformation, interacting and generating sentiment—\nJust as cinnabar forms from lead,\nMercury is extracted from cinnabar,\nWater generates wood,\nAnd fire arises from wood.\n\nTo seek the Dao beyond this is to incite emotional attachment.\nAs the *Book of Transformation* says: *\"The spirit transforms into Qi.\"*\nThe scripture states:\n*\"One gives birth to Two; Two gives birth to Three—*\nThis is the truth.\n\nAs the *Law of the Cosmic Region* says:\n*\"Transforming to produce all treasures,\nDescending into substance as Qi—\nIn this world, what form does it take?\nIf one knows this, what difficulty is there in embodying it?\"*\n\n---\n**Return and Reversion**\nLead and Mercury are, in truth, of one source—\nJust as lead arises from silver,\nCinnabar forms from lead,\nAnd mercury is extracted from cinnabar—\nThis is the principle of material nature.\n\nJust as water generates from gold,\nWater nurtures wood,\nAnd fire arises from wood—\nThis is the workings of creation.",

      "translated_text": "**Return and Reversion**\n\nCinnabar and mercury mutually resonate—\nWhen lead is added, silver is formed;\nWood and fire oppose each other—\nWhen earth is generated, gold arises—\nThis illustrates how within the human body, the *Dao* manifests as *qi* from emptiness,\nCondensing into substance and thus taking form—\nThis is called *xing-qi* (性炁).\n\nFrom *xing* forming and moving, *qing* (情) arises;\nWhen *xing* governs *qing*, and *qing* returns to *xing*,\nThe return to emptiness is achieved—\nThis is the principle of *return and reversion*.\n\nYet common folk, unaware of the Dao’s essence,\nConfuse *xing* with *qing*,\nAnd from *qing* derive *shi* (识);\nOnce *qing* and *shi* are stirred,\nThe original *xing* is lost.\n\nLittle do they know that *shen* (神) and *qi* (炁),\nAs well as *xing* (性) and *qing* (情),\nAre all but the empty primordial *qi*,\nDescending into form and artificially named—\nThe adept can unite with this through innate roots,\nReceived by the teacher’s oral transmission and mental guidance,\nAnd thus return to its origin.\n\nWhat is called *roots* (根) is, in truth, no separate thing—\nIt is simply *xing* and *shen* (神性).\nWhen it abides according to time within the inner chambers,\nIt is called *wu-tu* (戊土), known as *xing*.\nWhen one *qi* circulates and interacts, generating mutual excitation,\nIt is called *ji-tu* (己土), known as *qing*.\nWhen *xing* governs *qing*, and *qing* returns to *xing*,\nThen *being* and *non-being* intermingle,\nHidden and revealed align,\nEmpty and substantial harmonize,\nMovement and stillness nourish one another—\nAnd thus the cinnabar essence is perfected.\n\nThis is called *chun-qian* (纯乾), or *xuan-ti* (玄体).\n*Chun-qian* refers to the firm, robust, and upright essence—\nPure, refined, and subtle.\n*Xuan-ti* refers to the gathering into form when condensed,\nAnd the returning to *qi* when dispersed—\nOnly at this point can one truly speak of the Dao of *golden elixir return*.\n\nAs the *Paramartha Contract* says:\n*\"When gold returns to its nature, it is then called cinnabar.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Kan flows into Wu, Li adheres to Ji.\"*\n\nAs the *Awakening to True Scripture* says:\n*\"Take the real essence of the Kan position in the heart,\nTransform it through the Li palace in the abdomen’s Yin—\nFrom this arises the pure, robust body,\nHidden yet capable of flight—all by the mind’s will.\"*\n\nThus, in accordance with these teachings,\nThe scriptural principles of *tilting light to return to the chariot*,\n*Overseeing the True to guide rebirth*,\n*Commanding the Earthly Devas*,\nAnd *attending and escorting*—\nAll align without contradiction.\n\nAs the *Law of the Cosmic Region* says:\n*\"When this *qi* is further refined and transformed,\nIt becomes the elixir that leads to transcendence—\nThe principle is thus revealed.\"*\n\n**The Dao of Golden Elixir**\nThe Dao of the golden elixir requires only that one\n*Perceive nature and clarify the mind*,\n*Return to the root and restore the vital essence*,\n*Restore its original state*,\nAnd *revert to emptiness*—\nThis is called the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is that which,\nThough unseen by sight, is never absent,\nAnd though unheard by ear, is never silent—\nIt transcends all boundaries.\n\nThough it cannot be seen or heard,\nThe Dao is never truly absent—\nThis is the principle of *inner symbolism*:\n*\"The substance is hidden within the form,\nThe form is void yet contains the essence.\"*\n\nIf scholars fail to deeply grasp this,\nSome say it *is*,\nSome say it *is not*,\nSome say it *seems to be yet seems not*,\nSome say it is *neither being nor non-being*—\nAll are mistaken.\n\nLet me explain:\nThe external teachings and separate methods\nAll take lead and mercury as *yin* and *yang*,\nAnd vital essence as medicinal substance,\nThe mouth and nostrils as the *Mysterious Feminine*,\nThe heart and kidneys as *Kan* and *Li*.\n\nWith bellows and tripods competing in their operations,\nRed and purple distinctions are blurred—\nTheir confusion and errors are countless.\n\nHow could they know that when *qing* and *shi* are stirred,\nThis is the *vital spirit and essence*?\nWhen one disturbs the *vital spirit and essence*,\nThe original *xing* is lost—\nIf *xing* is obscured, where is the Dao?\n\nThus the *Buddhist teachings* say:\n*\"Those who study the Dao yet fail to recognize the True,\nMerely chase after the *shen* (神) from the start—\nThrough countless kalpas, they remain bound to birth and death,\nWhile fools call this the ‘original body.’\"*\nThis is precisely the case.\n\nThe Dao of the golden elixir has\n*A foundation and a root*,\n*A body and a function*—\nOnce the original *xing* is clarified,\nThe mind is pure and the emotions are tranquil.\n\nAs our *Confucian scholars* say:\n*\"Rectify the heart and sincerely intend,\nExtend knowledge and investigate things,\nSubdue the self and return to propriety,\nReflect upon oneself and achieve sincerity—\nHow could this be external to the Dao?\"*\n\nWhen applied to serving the ruler,\nIt manifests as *loyalty*;\nWhen applied to honoring parents,\nIt manifests as *filial piety*;\nWhen applied to interacting with others,\nIt manifests as *sincerity*;\nWhen applied to cultivating oneself,\nIt manifests as *rectitude*.\n\nIt harmonizes with the Void and unites with the Non-existent,\nEver-clear and ever-still,\nTrue emptiness and wondrous being,\nPiercing emptiness and complete penetration—\nThus the *Supreme Sage* says:\n*\"Artificially named, it is called the Dao.\"*\nWhat is called *elixir*, then, is but what?\n\nAs the *Awakening to True Scripture* says:\n*\"Further, one must investigate the root of nature above,\nAnd resolve the wondrous, non-arising function—\nIf one attains this, then all that inner symbolism reveals\nWill be pure jade, without variation in hue.\"*\n\nThis aligns with the *Heavenly Emperor’s Jade True, Colorless* state,\nAnd the *Dharma of the Vimalakirti* (景梵行).\n\nAs the *Odes* say:\n*\"The Heavenly One’s carriage moves without sound or scent—\nThis is the ultimate sincerity.\"*\n\nThe scripture says:\n*\"Profound wisdom pierces clarity,\nImmense capacity is the deepest mystery—\nThis is the ultimate truth.\"*\n\nAh! It is complete.\n\n**Releasing the Mysterious Diagram of the Supreme Extremity’s Marvelous Transformation and Divine Unity**\nThe *Diagram of the Supreme Extremity* was created by Master Lu Xi (濂溪先生),\nIlluminating the profound mysteries of creation\nAnd transmitting the unspoken secrets of the ancient sages.",
