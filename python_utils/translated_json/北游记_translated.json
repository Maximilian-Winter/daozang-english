  "full_translation": "*The Northern Journey*\n*Compiled by Yu Xiangdou of the Ming Dynasty*\n\n**Volume One: The Jade Emperor Hosts a Banquet for His Ministers**\n\nIt came to pass during the reign of Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty. One day, the Jade Emperor issued a celestial decree, commanding a grand feast to be held in the Tushita Palace of the Thirty-Third Heaven, summoning the Heavenly Lords Fu, Zhang, Xu, Li, Ge, and others. Upon receiving the decree, each Heavenly Lord arrived in due order. After the ceremonial prostrations and salutations were complete, the Jade Emperor spoke:\n\n\"For five hundred kalpas, I have stood at the pinnacle of the cosmos, laboring day and night without respite. Yet upon close reflection, the Central Heaven under my rule is not even a ten-thousandth part as splendid as the Western Paradise. Today, I have gathered you, my ministers, to devise a way for me to journey to the Western Realm, escape the cycle of kalpas, and listen to the Buddha’s teachings—only then shall I be free from all cares. If any among you can chart this path for me, it shall be counted as your merit.\"\n\nThe assembled Perfected Lords presented their memorial: \"In the mortal realm, one who cultivates immortality for seven lifetimes without breaking the precepts may ascend to serve Your Majesty. But to enter the Way in the mortal realm, one must first break the precepts for nine lifetimes before being reborn in the West. Your Majesty has always been an immortal—how could you enter the Western Paradise? To escape the cycle of birth and death, you must abandon your celestial form, leave the heavens, and cultivate as a mortal. Only then can you attain Buddhahood. Otherwise, it cannot be done.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the Jade Emperor let out a long sigh, and a thought of descending to the mortal realm arose in his mind. Suddenly, he noticed a golden-flowered tree across from him, its radiance dazzling, golden blossoms rising from its branches. The Jade Emperor asked, \"What is that shimmering brilliance before us? It fills me with admiration.\"\n\nGe, the Heavenly Lord, stepped forward and memorialized: \"This is no ordinary thing. Beyond the Nine Heavens of the Southern Xun Palace lies the residence of Heavenly Lord Liu, where stands a golden-flowered tree called the *Tree That Touches Heaven*. This tree gathers all manner of treasures, and its radiance is the glow of those very treasures, hence the golden light that shines so brightly.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the Jade Emperor immediately summoned the Fire Virtue Lord of the South and commanded him to visit Heavenly Lord Liu’s residence to request the celestial tree. The ministers withdrew from court, and the Star Lord, having received his orders, departed to the Southern Xun Palace to seek the *Tree That Touches Heaven* from Heavenly Lord Liu.\n\nNow, Heavenly Lord Liu was seated in his hall when he suddenly saw the envoy arrive. He welcomed him and bade him sit. Heavenly Lord Liu asked, \"Noble envoy, what brings you here with such a mandate?\"\n\nThe Star Lord replied, \"His Celestial Majesty was hosting a banquet when he beheld the radiance of your esteemed tree, its brilliance captivating him. He has dispatched this humble official to your residence to request this treasure.\"\n\nHeavenly Lord Liu said, \"How could I dare refuse such a request? Yet this tree has been passed down through generations in my family, and from it, the Seven Treasures manifest without cease. If Your Majesty were to take this tree, I fear that upon moving it, the Seven Treasures would scatter, the light would fade, and it would no longer flourish. It would truly be of no use. I humbly ask that the envoy return and memorialize the Jade Emperor, lest this treasure be harmed in vain.\"\n\nThe envoy, having heard these words, took his leave and returned to memorialize the Jade Emperor, recounting all that had transpired. Upon hearing this, the Jade Emperor grew furious and exclaimed, \"As the sovereign of all under Heaven, am I not even equal to Heavenly Lord Liu, who possesses such a tree that births the Seven Treasures, its radiance illuminating all, a wonder beyond words?\"\n\nHe then turned to his ministers and asked, \"Who is able to constantly enjoy the use of this tree?\"\n\nThe ministers memorialized: \"Only the descendants of Heavenly Lord Liu’s family are permitted to manage and enjoy this tree.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the Jade Emperor suddenly sighed aloud, \"How might I become one of his descendants and enjoy this treasure? Then my heart would be truly content!\"\n\nThe ministers, hearing the Jade Emperor’s words, were all astonished. They stepped forward and memorialized, \"The Sage does not speak idly. Since Your Majesty has uttered these words, you must be prepared to relinquish your throne and be reborn in the mortal realm.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor’s thoughts remained fixed on the *Tree That Touches Heaven*, and he disregarded the hardships of descending to the mortal realm. He replied, \"I shall follow your counsel. But if I go, who shall rule in my stead?\"\n\nThe ministers again memorialized: \"Your Majesty’s three souls may be divided. You may designate one soul to descend and be reborn in the mortal realm.\"\n\nUpon hearing that he must divide his three souls and send one forth, the Jade Emperor could not help but shed tears. The ministers memorialized, \"Once the Sage’s words are spoken, how can they be retracted? Without trust, there is no foundation. Your Majesty should swiftly issue the decree.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor said, \"Though I designate one soul to descend today, when shall it be complete?\"\n\nThe ministers memorialized: \"Your Majesty need not worry. Once the task is accomplished and perfection attained, you shall return to your original form.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor had no choice but to designate one soul to descend. The ministers each emitted a beam of golden light, which carried the soul straight to Heavenly Lord Liu’s residence to be reborn.\n\nNow, Heavenly Lord Liu and Princess Red Lotus were strolling in their rear garden when they suddenly saw a golden light descending from the center of the heavens. Within it were the Four Heavenly Kings, the Eight Great Vajrapani, and nine azure dragons, bearing a golden tray. Upon the tray lay an infant, and they descended straight into the garden.\n\nThe princess asked Heavenly Lord Liu, \"What is this?\"\n\nHeavenly Lord Liu replied, \"It must be a person of great nobility in distress, seeking to be reborn. My lady and I should pay our respects.\"\n\nUpon hearing her husband’s words, the princess immediately lit fine incense, and the two of them bowed in reverence. As they watched, the golden light drew nearer and entered the princess’s embrace. Heavenly Lord Liu was overjoyed and bowed in thanks to the heavens.\n\nWithin a month, Princess Red Lotus conceived. She informed Heavenly Lord Liu, who was overjoyed and declared, \"Since you are with child, this must surely be a person of great nobility.\"\n\nTime flew like an arrow, and before they knew it, a year had passed. On the ninth day of the ninth month in the third year of Yuanhuang, the chamber filled with an extraordinary fragrance. Suddenly, the princess could no longer bear the pain and gave birth to a son. Clouds gathered from all directions, shrouding the room in mist so that no one could be seen. A maidservant was sent to inform Heavenly Lord Liu, who rejoiced greatly. He named the child Liu Changsheng.\n\nThe days passed swiftly like a shuttle, and another three years went by. One day, Changsheng asked his parents, \"Does our family have any fine treasures?\"\n\nHis parents replied, \"Our family has the Sky-Reaching Tree, which radiates shimmering light and rises with purple qi, naturally producing the Seven Treasures. Some years ago, the Jade Emperor admired it and came to request it, but we did not give it to him.\"\n\nThe boy said, \"If we have such a fine treasure, let us go and see it.\"\n\nHeavenly Lord Liu did not stop him and took Changsheng to the garden to see the Sky-Reaching Tree. Upon entering the garden, Changsheng indeed saw the tree, its radiant light piercing the heavens and its purple dew ascending into the clouds. Overjoyed, he burned incense before the tree every morning and made offerings to it.\n\nNow, within the tree originally resided the Many-Treasures Tathāgata, the Treasure-Victorious Tathāgata, the Wondrous-Form Tathāgata, the Vast-Victorious Tathāgata, the Detached-from-Dust Tathāgata, the Nectar-King Tathāgata, and the Immeasurable-Life Tathāgata—these Seven Treasure Tathāgatas had long dwelled in the tree, which was why it possessed such marvelous qualities. Seeing that the Jade Emperor, now reborn here, made such earnest offerings, the Tathāgatas could not accept them and discussed among themselves before departing.\n\nOne day, Changsheng entered the garden again to make offerings, only to find the tree’s bark and leaves withering, its light entirely gone. Greatly alarmed, he gazed at it for a long while and said to himself, \"Yesterday, it was still full of treasures—why is there nothing today? There must be a reason. I shall see if it returns tomorrow.\" With that, he left the garden.\n\nNow, the Seven Treasure Tathāgatas, unaware of the Jade Emperor’s intentions, saw that he made offerings morning and night with such devotion. They discussed the matter and went to the Hall of the Three Purities to ask the Three Pure Ones about the Jade Emperor’s purpose.\n\nUpon arriving at the Hall of the Three Purities and greeting the Three Pure Lords, the Tathāgatas said, \"We seven have dwelled in this estate for over a hundred kalpas. We did not know the Jade Emperor had come here to be reborn. Every day, he makes earnest offerings to us. We dare not accept the Jade Emperor’s veneration, so we left the Sky-Reaching Tree and came to this hall to seek your counsel. We do not understand the Jade Emperor’s intentions.\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones—Jade Purity, Supreme Purity, and Grand Purity—sighed and said, \"If we did not tell you, you would indeed remain ignorant. One day, the Jade Emperor held a feast for his ministers. He saw a brilliant golden light opposite him, unaware that it was the radiance of you seven. Upon seeing it, he asked his ministers, who reported that it was the Sky-Reaching Tree in Heavenly Lord Liu’s home. Seeing the treasure’s light, the Jade Emperor grew covetous. He sent envoys to retrieve it, but they failed. He then asked his ministers, 'I greatly desire this tree. Since I cannot obtain it, who could rightfully possess it?' His ministers replied, 'Only his descendants could rightfully have it.' Upon hearing this, the Jade Emperor’s greed knew no bounds. Suddenly, he sighed and said, 'If I could become his descendant and enjoy this tree, my heart would be content.' His ministers, startled, immediately petitioned the Jade Emperor to descend and be reborn. With no choice, the Jade Emperor sent one of his souls to take a transformed body and be reborn in Heavenly Lord Liu’s home. Now, seeing you seven, his former greed remains unresolved, which is why he offers you such rich gifts. The Jade Emperor’s sacred heart is now entangled in worldly toil due to his greed, and it may be difficult for him to return. Even if he does, it was because he coveted you that this came to pass—this is not advantageous for you either. One of you seven should transform into a Daoist and exhort him to cultivate the Way. Another should transform into a Daoist and wait beneath the Sky-Reaching Tree. When Changsheng comes to make offerings and sees the tree withered and dull, he will surely be angry. If he sees you by the tree, he will accuse you of stealing the treasure and harming the tree. When he seeks to confront you, reveal your divine powers and enlighten him to cultivate the Way.\"\n\nThe Tathāgatas bowed and took their leave of the Three Pure Ones. One transformed into a Daoist and deliberately sat beneath the Sky-Reaching Tree in Liu’s home.\n\nThe next day, Changsheng went to the rear garden and saw the tree withering, its treasure-light completely vanished. His heart was filled with sorrow. The following day, he returned to the garden and found the tree nearly dead, its radiance entirely gone. Enraged, he suddenly saw a Daoist behind the tree. Changsheng seized him and demanded, \"I wondered why the tree had died and its treasures vanished—so it was you, a wild Daoist, who stole them!\"\n\nThe Daoist did not answer, only smiling faintly. Changsheng, furious, dragged him out of the garden and into the hall to interrogate him. The Daoist merely smiled again. Seeing that he would not respond, Changsheng beat him with a stick, but the stick broke, and the Daoist did not cry out in pain. He then struck with a blade, but the blade snapped, and the Daoist transformed into a streak of golden light and rose into the air.\n\nChangsheng was terrified and bowed to the heavens, saying, \"I, unworthy as I am, did not recognize the immortal and offended your sacred body. I beg forgiveness for my transgressions.\"\n\nThe immortal replied, \"I am no other than one of the Seven Treasures within your tree, which once manifested treasures in your home.\"\n\nChangsheng asked, \"Why did you rely on the tree for its radiance?\"\n\nThe immortal said, \"My six brothers and I, seeing that the Heavenly Palace lacked treasures, relied on the tree to manifest our forms, illuminating the Thirty-Three Heavens and displaying our divine powers.\"\n\nLongsheng asked, \"Why do you wish to leave now?\"\n\nThe assembly of Tathāgatas replied, \"Formerly, when the Heavenly Palace lacked treasures, we brothers manifested our radiance. Now that the Heavenly Palace abounds in treasures, our divine powers go unseen, so we must depart.\"\n\nLongsheng said, \"If the Heavenly Palace is rich in treasures, I beg the assembly of Tathāgatas to take me along.\"\n\nThe Tathāgatas replied, \"If you wish to reach the heart of Heaven, you must sever all attachments of love. Should desire and attachment remain, the Way will be difficult to tread.\"\n\nLongsheng said, \"If the immortal masters do not cast me aside, I shall take leave of my parents and follow at once.\"\n\nThe Tathāgatas answered, \"Very well.\"\n\nLongsheng then entered the inner hall to bid farewell to his parents. He was determined to ascend to the Thirty-Three Heavens, but Lord Liu and Princess Honglian pleaded desperately to keep him, to no avail. Suddenly, within the Ninefold Heaven, a mass of black clouds drew near, and a fierce wind arose, snatching the child from the palace. As the black clouds dispersed, Lord Liu and his wife found their son gone and wept bitterly—this need not be recounted further.\n\nThe assembly of Tathāgatas carried Longsheng beyond the palace and led him straight to the Hall of the Three Pure Ones, where they recounted the earlier events. Upon seeing Longsheng, the Three Pure Ones invited him to rise after he bowed, then seated him among them.\n\nThe Three Pure Ones asked, \"Do you recognize who we are?\"\n\nLongsheng replied, \"I have never met you before and do not know the honorable immortals.\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones smiled and said, \"Do you know who you were in your past life?\"\n\nLongsheng answered, \"I truly do not. I beg the immortal masters to enlighten me. If I am destined for the immortal’s bond, I shall never forget your kindness.\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones said, \"Look into the Heavenly Mirror in our inner hall and see who you are.\"\n\nLongsheng went to the mirror and gazed into it, where he saw the image of the Jade Emperor. Startled, he returned and said to the Three Pure Ones, \"When I looked into the mirror, I saw the form of the Jade Emperor. Could it be that my former self was the Jade Emperor?\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones replied, \"Indeed.\"\n\nLongsheng asked, \"If my former self was the Jade Emperor, why was I cast out of the Thirty-Three Heavens and reborn beyond the Ninefold Heaven?\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones said, \"You were one of the Jade Emperor’s souls. In your past life, upon seeing the radiance of Lord Liu’s Seven Treasures Tree, you grew greedy and willingly cast aside the cycle of life and death, thus falling beyond the Ninefold Heaven to satisfy your desire.\"\n\nLongsheng asked, \"How may I restore my true and original form?\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones replied, \"This is not difficult. To regain your true form, you must cultivate upright conduct, study the Dao, and refine your authenticity. Only then can you return to your origin.\"\n\nLongsheng said, \"Where in Heaven shall I cultivate?\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones answered, \"There is no suffering in Heaven. If you wish to return as before, you must descend to the mortal realm.\"\n\nLongsheng asked, \"How can an immortal embryo enter the mortal realm?\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones said, \"If you are willing to cultivate with a steadfast heart, there is Penglai Mountain in the middle realm—the foremost mountain under Heaven. We shall perform a ritual to cast you down to the mortal realm.\"\n\nLongsheng asked, \"Who will attend to my meals?\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones replied, \"When hungry, eat the green pine; when thirsty, drink the sweet spring.\"\n\nLongsheng said, \"If I may restore my original form through cultivation, I am willing to follow your teachings.\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones then drew from their sleeve a Ruyi Flower stem. Instructing Longsheng to close his eyes, they struck him with it, sending him into the mortal realm upon Penglai Mountain.\n\nWhat befalls him later shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n*Meanwhile, the court ministers and lord go hunting...*\n\nThe Kingdom of Gege’s King Cheng’an issued a decree one day, summoning civil officials Zhang Ming and Li Tao, along with military officers Liu Feihu and Zheng Zheng, and the entire court of civil and military ministers. They readied their bows and arrows and set forth for Penglai Mountain to hunt and roam its peaks. The ministers received the decree and, donning their armor, followed the king’s procession—this shall not be further recounted here.\n\nThe narrative now divides. As for Longsheng, ever since the Three Pure Ones cast him down to Penglai, he had built a thatched hut to cultivate the Dao. When hungry, he ate the green pine; when thirsty, he drank the sweet spring, never daring to stray even half a step. For twenty years he had dwelled upon the mountain in cultivation. One day, as he sat in meditation, the beasts of the mountain—driven and pursued by the king’s soldiers—all gathered before his meditation seat. Some knelt, some bowed, some kowtowed, some cried out, some wailed, all bearing expressions of sorrow and terror. Though Longsheng had not witnessed the king’s pursuit, he saw the beasts’ distress and their pleading demeanor, as if seeking refuge.\n\nLongsheng addressed the beasts: “From your manner, I surmise you are in peril and seek my aid?” The beasts nodded and cried in response. Longsheng said, “If that is so, take shelter behind my mountain.” Hearing this, the beasts hurriedly fled behind the hut. Before long, King Cheng’an arrived with his retinue. The king asked Longsheng, “Have you seen any beasts pass this way?” Longsheng sat in silence, unmoving. The king asked again, and again Longsheng did not respond. Enraged, the king ordered his generals to sever the hermit’s limbs. Longsheng merely smiled faintly, still silent. The king, further incensed, declared, “Do you dare mock me, thinking I cannot take your head?” He commanded his warriors to dismember the Daoist into ten thousand pieces. In an instant, clouds darkened the sky and earth, yet Longsheng remained whole, his limbs restored as before.\n\nThe king was struck with awe. Clasping his hands, he prostrated himself and said, “This humble one, with mortal eyes, failed to recognize a celestial immortal. I have offended the heavenly decree—pray, celestial one, show mercy and pardon my transgression. I beg you to return with me to the palace. I shall dismiss my ministers and accompany you back here to cultivate the Dao.” Longsheng sighed and said, “Your Majesty is already an immortal—why seek the Way?” The king pleaded repeatedly, entreating Longsheng to return to court, for he was resolved to renounce the world and cultivate. Longsheng took up his brush and composed a poem for the king, who read:\n\n*For twenty years on Penglai I’ve stayed,*\n*Hunger fed by pine, thirst by spring’s cascade.*\n*From my humble hut afar I see—*\n*Your Majesty, too, once walked the immortals’ way.*\n\nAfter reading the poem, the king kowtowed again and said, “The celestial’s verse reveals that I, too, once belonged to the immortal ranks. Now, having lost my original face, I beg you, great immortal, to return with me to court and guide me back to the path.” Longsheng replied, “Since Your Majesty is determined to renounce the world, this humble one shall accompany you.” The king rejoiced, and with his civil and military officials, followed Longsheng back to the palace. The ministers dispersed, while the king and the Grand Master Longsheng feasted in the Jingle Palace.\n\nThe queen, Princess Yutang, hearing that the king had welcomed a celestial immortal to the palace—one of such awe-inspiring power—emerged from her chambers to pay homage to the Grand Master. Gazing upon him, she saw a man of noble bearing, his features refined and striking, his lips crimson, his teeth white. Enamored, she teased, “Such beauty in a celestial! If I could bear you a prince tomorrow, as fair as you, my heart would be content.” The Grand Master, startled by her words, composed a poem in reply:\n\n*The Dao is cultivated in the red dust of the mortal world,*\n*Its root lies in discipline and conduct unfurled.*\n*Should palace women tempt me to folly’s sway,*\n*This life shall pass—no return another day.*\n\nAs the Grand Master finished speaking, his dharma protector, watching from midair, saw the line *“no return another day”* and surmised that the king’s lingering worldly attachments had not yet dissolved. The protector transformed into a palace maid and descended from the heavens to admonish the Grand Master. Standing before his altar, the maid asked, “Do you know who I am?” The Grand Master replied, “You are a palace attendant.” The dharma protector said, “You do not recognize me—I am your protector, Zhu Li. I heard your vow to the queen in your poem, pledging to return. Since ancient times, sages do not speak carelessly; careless words bind one to the wheel of rebirth. You must go to the queen, fulfill your poetic vow, and wed her—only then may you reenter the Buddha’s realm.”\n\nHearing this, the Grand Master wept bitterly. The maid vanished into the sky, and the Grand Master, overcome with grief, fell gravely ill. Within seven days, he passed away. When King Cheng’an learned of this, he wept bitterly and prepared a coffin, burying the Grand Master on Purple Gold Mountain. Seven days later, the queen, grieving for the Grand Master’s death, also perished. The king mourned deeply and had her interred beside the Grand Master on Purple Gold Mountain. He then named Consort Deng as his new queen.\n\nThe Grand Master transformed into a golden light and entered Consort Deng’s womb. On the eighteenth day of the eleventh month in the *jiawu* year, at the hour of noon, she gave birth to a son—his features dignified, his countenance refined. King Cheng’an rejoiced and named him Xuanming.\n\nMeanwhile, the late queen, after her death, was reborn into a wealthy family surnamed Li. On the day of her birth, the entire chamber filled with fragrance, and she was named Xiangniang.\n\nThe Grand Master, now the crown prince, held his grand wedding in the third year of the *Dading* reign and chose Xiangniang as his queen.\n\nOne day, the king ascended the throne, and an envoy from the Western Barbarian kingdom of Gelitian’er arrived, presenting a bronze drum twelve inches thick. The envoy, having delivered it to the Goge Kingdom, was announced by the court herald and brought before the king. The emissary proclaimed, “My sovereign declares that as there is no fixed order among nations, we must determine which is greater. Our kingdom possesses a bronze drum twelve inches thick. My lord commands that it be presented to your kingdom. If anyone here can shoot an arrow through it, your kingdom shall be deemed the superior state. If none can, then yours shall be the lesser, and you must pay annual tribute to our kingdom.”\n\nUpon hearing this, the king grew furious and issued a royal decree: whoever could shoot through the bronze drum would be promoted in rank. The nation’s guardian general, Liu Feihu—a warrior of unmatched valor, whose arms bore the strength of a thousand men—stepped forward and declared, “Your Majesty, do not fret. Though the Western Barbarians have sent this drum, I can pierce it.” The king rejoiced and bestowed upon him three cups of imperial wine. Liu Feihu received the honor, hung the drum in the hall, drew his bow with his left hand, and nocked an arrow with his right. He loosed the shot, but the arrow penetrated only half an inch into the drum. His face flushed with shame as he prostrated himself upon the golden steps. The king was deeply vexed.\n\nPrince Xuanming, then only seven years old, had heard the commotion from the palace. He emerged and addressed the king: “No one else can shoot through this drum—only your child can.” The king replied, “The barbarian drum is twelve inches thick. Even General Liu Feihu, whose might is unmatched by ten thousand men, could not pierce it. You are but seven years old—how could you possess such strength?” The prince said, “Strength is not a matter of size. Father, rest easy and watch your son shoot.” The king was overjoyed.\n\nThe prince had the drum hung high, then stood a hundred paces away in the golden hall. Drawing his bow with his left hand and nocking an arrow with his right, he summoned the barbarian envoy and asked, “If I pierce this drum, what then?” The envoy replied, “We shall pay tribute to your kingdom year after year.”\n\n\"If I fail to pierce the drum, we shall pay tribute to your kingdom instead.\" The prince shouted, \"If I shoot through this drum, your head shall fall to the ground as well.\" The barbarian envoy, thinking the prince could not possibly succeed, gave a faint, mocking smile.\n\nThe prince spoke no more. Taking aim at the bronze drum, he loosed an arrow—it struck true, burying itself to the fletching and piercing the drum clean through. The assembled generals roared their approval, and the king was overjoyed. The prince immediately ordered the envoy’s execution, and his head was displayed as a warning. Turning to the remaining barbarian soldiers, the prince commanded, \"I ought to behead you all as well, but I shall spare your worthless lives. Return and tell your king to hasten his tribute, lest my kingdom march to war.\" The barbarian soldiers, trembling with fear, fled in disarray.\n\nThe king held a grand feast and gathered his ministers, but of what followed, more will be told in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\n**The Prince Leads Troops to Repel the Barbarian Army**\n\nNow, the barbarian king, Goritian’er, ascended his throne. To his left stood his civil ministers, Maodahai and Li Yiyun; to his right, his generals, Jian Kaipowuzhu and Shun Qing. After the assembled officials had paid their respects, a messenger announced, \"The barbarian soldiers have returned from their mission.\" The king summoned them forward. The soldiers reported how the prince of the Goruo Kingdom had shot through the bronze drum and executed their envoy. Enraged, the barbarian king issued a decree: he would dispatch fifty thousand troops, with Maodahai commanding the army, Jian Kaipowuzhu as vanguard, and Shun Qing as deputy general. Each was granted three cups of imperial wine before they took their leave, marching straight toward the Goruo Kingdom.\n\nMeanwhile, the king of Goruo, now sixty-one years old and seeing his son’s prowess, held a grand feast for his ministers and abdicated the throne to the prince. The prince, after a hundred prostrations, ascended the throne at the tender age of thirteen, declaring the first year of the *Dingda* era. The ministers paid their respects, and the prince hosted a banquet to celebrate the peace.\n\nYet before three months had passed, one day as the prince held court, a messenger announced, \"The Western Barbarian king, Goritian’er, has sent Maodahai to lead fifty thousand troops against our kingdom.\" Upon hearing this, the prince flew into a rage. He ordered General Zhao Shineng to take command of the army, with Ma Mengming as vanguard and Li Shiji as deputy general, to confront the barbarian forces.\n\nZhao Shineng accepted the decree and left the court, leading his troops to camp at the Sword Pass. At dawn the next day, the two armies faced each other on the battlefield. The barbarian general Wuzhu rode forth, and Ma Mengming of the southern army met him. After a fierce battle, Ma Mengming was soundly defeated and retreated into the pass. The following day, Zhao Shineng personally led the main army out to challenge the barbarians. The barbarian general Maodahai also advanced with his forces. From morning until afternoon, the southern army fought valiantly but could not overcome the barbarian generals, suffering a crushing defeat and retreating into the pass, where they barred the gates and dared not emerge. A messenger was dispatched with a report to King Dingda.\n\nUpon receiving the missive, the king was furious and wished to lead the campaign himself. His ministers pleaded against it, and the king demanded, \"If I do not go, what strategy remains?\" The ministers replied, \"There is no commander-in-chief in the court. We beseech Your Majesty to issue a proclamation—if a great general can be recruited, what fear is there that the barbarian forces will not retreat?\" The king agreed and immediately posted an imperial notice. But of what followed, more will be told in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\n**The Heavenly Worthy Instructs the Jade Emperor**\n\nNow, the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Joy, observing from the heavens that the Jade Emperor had incarnated as the king of the Goruo Kingdom, thought to himself: *If I do not go to enlighten and guide him in cultivation, his golden body may be destroyed, and he will struggle to return to his original form.* With that, he transformed himself in the clouds, becoming a Daoist priest. Descending to the mortal realm, he arrived at the Five Phoenix Tower and tore down the imperial notice.\n\nThe next day, as King Dingda held court, a messenger announced, \"A Daoist priest has come to the tower and taken down the proclamation.\" The king ordered him brought forward. The priest entered the hall and paid his respects. The king asked, \"You have taken down my notice—what ability do you possess to repel the barbarian army?\" The priest replied, \"Though I am unworthy, I have received teachings from an extraordinary master. I can command flying sand and rolling stones, summon wind and rain—what fear is there of barbarian troops? I can scatter them like wind flattening grass.\"\n\nThe king, overjoyed, asked, \"How many soldiers will you require for this campaign?\" The priest answered, \"Not a single one.\" The king said, \"The barbarian generals number in the dozens, and their troops fifty thousand. You claim to need no soldiers, yet go alone—I fear you will be outnumbered.\" The priest replied, \"Your Majesty need not worry. This humble servant has his own methods.\" The king, greatly pleased, allowed him to proceed.\n\nThe priest left the court and traveled straight to the Sword Pass, where he met Zhao Shineng. The next morning, the barbarian army once again besieged the pass, hurling insults. A soldier rushed to report the taunts. The priest took leave of the generals, ascended the pass’s tower, unbound his hair, and grasped his sword. Holding a seven-star blade in one hand and a bowl of clear water in the other, he recited true incantations. Then he ordered the gates opened.\n\nIn an instant, the sky darkened, and earth grew dim. Sand and stones flew through the air, hurtling toward the north. The priest shouted from the tower, and the southern soldiers surged forth to join the battle. The barbarian troops, unable to flee, panicked, their heads and limbs battered until they were crushed. Of the fifty thousand barbarian soldiers, not one escaped alive.\n\nAlas! When Master Yu observed this scene, he composed a poem in lament:\n*Sand flies, stones swirl in a murky haze,*\n*The mighty army wails, a hive of bees in disarray...*\n\nThe clouds dispersed, and the barbarian generals’ voices faded—\nonly corpses lay strewn across the battlefield.\n\nNow, the Venerable Miaole of the Heavenly Worthies had wielded his magic, summoning flying sand and hurtling stones to slay fifty thousand barbarian soldiers in an instant, sparing not a single life. He then led his followers back to the court.\n\nKing Ding ascended the throne, and the memorial officer announced the Daoist priest’s triumphant return. Overjoyed, the king summoned him to court and received the customary acclamation. The king declared, “This realm is mine, yet without you, it could not be preserved. I shall enfeoff you as a First-Rank Minister of the Court and appoint you National Preceptor.”\n\nThe Daoist replied, “Your servant does not seek office.”\n\nThe king asked, “If not office, then do you desire gold, treasures, or beauties?”\n\nThe Daoist answered, “I desire none of these.”\n\n“Then what do you seek?” the king pressed.\n\nThe Daoist said, “Having pacified the barbarian lands, I now wish to return to Mount Zhongnan to visit my master. After a decade or more, I shall return to receive your investiture.”\n\nHearing this, the king had no choice but to comply. He issued a decree commanding all civil and military officials to escort the Daoist beyond the palace gates. The Daoist took his leave and departed.\n\nTime passed swiftly, like an arrow, days and months like a shuttle. The Jade Emperor, incarnated as king of the land of Gege, had reigned in peace for ten years and had fathered a son.\n\nOne day, the Venerable Miaole of the Heavenly Worthies, seated in meditation in the Heavenly Palace, observed that the king of Gege was gradually losing his original countenance. He reflected, “A decade ago, I aided Jinque in repelling the enemy, and I wished to guide him back to his true nature. Yet he had no heir then—now he has a son. If I do not swiftly deliver him, I fear it may harm his golden body.”\n\nHaving spoken, he descended to the mortal realm and entered the king’s presence. The king asked, “What brings you here today? Do you seek office?”\n\nThe Daoist stood upon the golden steps and replied:\n*“I have heard of Han Emperor Wu,*\n*And even Qin’s First Sovereign—*\n*Both craved the arts of immortals,*\n*Yet never met a guide to the transcendent realm.*\n*Though you have encountered one who knows the Way,*\n*You remain deluded, lost in reckoning.”*\n\n*“Hasten to part from love and attachment,*\n*Lest you fall into the sight of impermanence.”*\n\nThe king, hearing this, was greatly alarmed and asked, “Who are you, sir?”\n\nThe Daoist replied, “A man of the heavens.”\n\nThe king pressed further, “Why have you come here?”\n\n“For your sake, I have come.”\n\n“What matter concerns me?”\n\nThe Daoist answered, “I see that you have long been entangled in wealth and honor, unaware of turning back. I have heard that you have named an heir to the throne—soon, you must depart this world. Unwilling to witness this, I have come to show Your Majesty the path to escape death: abandon love and attachment, cast aside riches and honor, and put an end to greed. Only then may you avoid death.”\n\nThe king said, “If such a path exists, there could be no greater kindness. I beg you, Master, to instruct me clearly.”\n\nThe Daoist replied, “If you truly wish to leave the household life, you may immediately leave the palace and bow to me as your teacher.”\n\nUpon hearing this, the king descended the steps and prostrated himself. The Daoist sat unmoving and said, “I will go ahead. Do not break your word—come swiftly.” With that, he departed the court. The king rose and saw him off.\n\nThe king returned to court and ascended the throne. His ministers, civil and military, all prostrated themselves upon the golden steps and petitioned, “Matters of the netherworld are difficult to verify—how could Your Majesty heed the Daoist’s words and abandon a kingdom of ten thousand chariots?”\n\nThe king heard their plea as though the wind had passed by his ears, not listening to a single word. He immediately issued an edict summoning the crown prince to court to ascend the throne. The prince, weeping bitterly, tried to dissuade his father. When the news spread throughout the palace, all came forward, pleading with a thousand words, yet none could sway him. The king was resolute in leaving the household life, and the prince had no choice but to take the throne. The palace ladies dispersed, and the king, the queen, and the prince could not bear their parting.\n\nThe king composed a poem:\n*“How could I bear to leave this land of brocade and silk?\nYet I cannot part from my beloved wife and child.\nFearing that death may come if I delay even slightly,\nI sever the dust of the mortal world to escape delusion.”*\n\nAfter inscribing the poem, the queen and prince lingered in sorrow, unwilling to let the king go. Yet the king’s heart was as hard as iron, not a single tear falling—his mind was set on leaving the household. The ministers and the prince escorted him out of the court, and after thirty *li*, the prince, overcome with grief, wept aloud. The king said, “My son, do not shed tears. A father’s resolve to depart cannot be stayed. Say no more of other matters—only hold the realm as your foundation, filial piety as your foremost duty, and ensure the people do not suffer.” With these words, he parted from the prince and went on his way.\n\nThe prince collapsed in despair, and the ministers helped him onto his horse to return to court, where he ascended the throne. The first year of his reign was named the *Kaiming* era. The prince granted a general amnesty throughout the land, and the ministers offered their congratulations. But what befell thereafter shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\nThe king, having bid farewell to his ministers, the queen, and the prince, journeyed alone for a day. As dusk approached, he suddenly saw the Daoist coming toward him. The king bowed in reverence. The Daoist said, “You have come at last—all is settled.” The king replied, “Master, my heart is set on leaving the household—what remains unsettled?” The Daoist said, “Your kingdom is wealthy—now you depart.” The king answered, “Master, my heart yearns for the Dao and leaving the household—why would I return to enjoy my former kingdom?” The Daoist said again, “The mountains are harsh—hunger and cold await.” The king replied, “With my whole heart seeking the Way, how could I fear hardship?”\n\nThe Daoist smiled faintly and said, “Since you are truly resolved to leave the household, follow me into Mount Penglai.” The king assented and followed him deep into the mountain. There, he beheld:\n*Peach blossoms and willows in full bloom before his eyes,\nGreen mountains faintly rising, a sight to praise.\nCranes cry and apes howl—he hears them near,\nA scene of divine creation, beyond compare.\nYoung pines and cypresses stand in rows,\nClouds drift o’er peaks where rare flowers grow.\nFrom the cliffs, cascades crash in a ceaseless flow,\nA view of ten thousand years’ worth, none could bestow.*\n\nNow, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy had transformed into a Daoist, guiding the king to Mount Penglai, where they built a thatched hut. Day and night, he expounded the scriptures and preached the Dharma to the king. One day, the Heavenly Worthy, testing the king’s progress in seated meditation, feared his worldly attachments were not yet severed. He devised a plan, saying, “I crave a peach—go down the mountain and buy one to offer me.”\n\nThe king assented and immediately left the mountain to purchase the fruit. Meanwhile, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy, seeing the king depart, transformed himself into a beautiful young woman and went to the market to sell peaches. When the king saw the woman carrying peaches, he approached to buy some. The woman said, “This peach is the only one borne by its tree—it costs a thousand taels of gold.” The king laughed, “Even if it were the sole fruit of the tree, it is not worth a thousand gold.” The woman replied, “If you will not pay a thousand gold, I, a widow, see that you are a man of noble bearing. I would gladly offer you the peach and become your wife—what say you?”\n\nThe king said, “I am one who has left the household.” The woman said, “Returning to lay life is an ancient principle. My family possesses great wealth—if you do not reject me, you could enjoy it all. If you remain obstinate, you may regret it too late.”\n\nThe king made no reply, turned away from the woman, and searched through all four city gates for red peaches, but found none. Then he saw the woman again, carrying peaches and approaching him. She said, “Do not let this chance slip by—such an encounter will not come again.” The king still did not answer. The woman continued, “If you truly refuse in this life, will you at least grant me the bond of our next existence? Then I shall give you this peach.” The king thought to himself, *“How can one know what the next life holds? If I agree, it will do no harm. If I refuse, I will have no peach to bring back—how then shall I face my master?”* So he said to the woman, “I may grant the next life, but in this one, I absolutely cannot comply.” The woman smiled and said, “Since you have agreed to the next life, I entrust this peach to you—do not go back on your word.” The king took the peach, overjoyed, and said to himself, *“Had I not promised her the next life, how would I have obtained this peach?”* Delighted beyond measure, he returned to the mountain and presented the peach to his master, the Heavenly Venerable. The Heavenly Venerable reverted to his true form, took the peach, and said, “Disciple, you went down the mountain to buy peaches—why have you broken the precepts?” The king was greatly startled and replied, “Master, what do you mean? This disciple went down the mountain without the slightest transgression—how could I have broken the precepts?” The Heavenly Venerable smiled and said, “Did you not pledge to that woman a vow for the next life?” The king answered, “I dare not deceive you, Master. This disciple searched everywhere for peaches but found none, save for a woman selling one. When I tried to buy it, she demanded that I become her husband before she would sell it to me. I refused. Then she said that if I would not consent in this life, I should at least promise her a predestined bond in the next, and she would give me the peach. Had I not agreed, I would have returned empty-handed and failed to see you, Master. So I promised her the next life—though it was merely a desperate expedient, not a true commitment. Clearly, this was but a lie on my part—how could it count as breaking the precepts?” The Heavenly Venerable smiled again and said, “Disciple, you are deluded. Since ancient times, once a word is spoken, not even a team of four horses can retrieve it—how can it be a lie? Now that you have pledged to that woman a bond for the next life, all your past merit is undone, and you must fall back into the mortal realm.” Hearing this, the king wept bitterly and asked, “Can this be avoided?” The Heavenly Venerable replied, “The Way of cultivation is strict, and Heaven and Earth are impartial—how could it be avoided? You must be reborn and cultivate anew before you may enter the Dao.” The king kowtowed and pleaded, “If it cannot be avoided, I beg you, Master, in your compassion, let me fall into a place without love or attachment, so that I may swiftly attain the immortal path.” The Heavenly Venerable said, “Where is there a place without love or attachment? You have planted good roots, but it was a momentary lapse in thought that has brought this upon you. Now, if you are to be reborn, you will surely enter a virtuous household in your next life—there is no need for sorrow.” The king asked, “Master, where shall I be reborn?” The Heavenly Venerable replied, “With my wisdom-eye, I see that the king of Xixia has practiced goodness for three generations, yet has no heir. He is now performing rituals to pray for one. You shall be reborn there.” Upon hearing this, the king wept uncontrollably and refused to eat for seven days before dying. The Heavenly Venerable cast the king’s body into the sea, where fish and crabs consumed it, fulfilling his vow of relinquishing the flesh. Then he summoned back the three hun and seven po souls and sent them to be reborn in the kingdom of Xixia—of what followed, more in the next chapter.\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable’s Second Audience with the Jade Emperor\n\nNow, the king of Xixia, Li Tianfu, had reached the age of forty without an heir. One day, he ascended the throne and gathered his civil and military officials to deliberate, saying, “This year, I have turned forty, yet I have no son to inherit the throne. What is to be done?”\n\nThe civil officials Peng Liang, Peng Li, and Zhou Shirong, along with the military officers Guo Chun and Yue Riji, along with the assembled ministers, petitioned, “We have heard that for those who pray for an heir, only the Heavenly Rites of Offering yield results. Your Majesty may fast and purify yourself, then perform the rites—perhaps Heaven will grant you a son.”\n\nThe king followed their counsel and ordered Meng Ying, the commander of the palace guards, to erect an altar and select an auspicious day for the rites. On the chosen day, Queen Mo Shanxuan accompanied the king as they personally ascended the altar to offer incense. The Heavenly Venerable, with his wisdom-eye, saw this and cast the three *hun* and seven *po* souls into the queen’s womb.\n\nA month after the rites concluded, the queen indeed conceived, and the king rejoiced, hosting a grand feast for his ministers. Time passed swiftly, like an arrow loosed or a shuttle thrown, and Queen Mo Shanxuan carried the child for three years and sixty days without giving birth. One day, the king ascended the throne in a fury and summoned the queen from the palace, demanding, “Since ancient times, women have carried children for ten months before birth. You have borne this child for so long—surely it is an unnatural pregnancy. I suspect you, and I intend to kill you.”\n\nThe queen was terrified and pleaded, “Ever since Your Majesty performed the rites, I have received your favor and conceived this child. How could it be unnatural? I beg you to grant me three more days in the palace. If I still do not give birth, I will take my own life before you.”\n\nThe king’s anger subsided, and he granted her request. The queen returned to the palace, tears streaming down her face, and sighed, “I harbor no ill intent. Who knows what sins I committed in a past life? Now, married to a man of the highest nobility, I remained childless at forty, and this strange pregnancy will cost me my life!”\n\nBefore she could finish speaking, a voice cried out from her womb, “Mother, do not worry. I am a virtuous soul reborn. If Father is angry, tell him that in ancient times, the Most High Lord Lao once remained in his mother’s womb for eighty-three years.”\n\nThe queen replied, “Though it is said that the Most High Lord Lao once did so, you claim to be a virtuous soul reborn. Yet your father does not believe me, and he has given me only three days. Even if you are a good person, if you do not emerge, your father will execute me in three days, and you will be unfilial.”\n\nThe child in her womb answered, “Mother, do not worry. This unworthy one will leave your womb tonight at the hour of *xu*. I only fear it may startle you.”\n\nThe queen said, “Then be quick and be born. If you do, I will die without regret.”\n\nAs she spoke, her belly began to ache faintly, and the sounds of labor arose. The palace maids rushed to attend her. At the transition between *you* and *xu*, the Patriarch emerged from his mother’s womb. It was the third day of the third month in the first year of the Zixue era, at the hour of *xu*. A radiant glow filled the room, and an extraordinary fragrance permeated the air. The maids looked and saw that it was a boy. They hurried out to report to the king.\n\nThe king personally ordered his procession to enter the palace and commanded the attendants to bring the crown prince out for him to see. The palace maids carried the prince before the king, who gazed upon him with his own eyes. Seeing that the prince was born with an upright and dignified countenance, the king rejoiced greatly. At dawn the following day, he ascended the throne, prepared a grand banquet, and feasted his ministers. The assembled officials offered their congratulations, and the king was overjoyed. He bestowed upon the prince the name *Xuánhuǎng*. The court then withdrew.\n\nTime passed swiftly, and in the blink of an eye, the king of Xixia once more enjoyed fifteen years of peace. One day, the king ascended the throne, and after the morning court session, he addressed his ministers: “I am now fifty-eight years old, and my years have grown heavy upon me. I am weary of governing the state. The crown prince has come of age, and his filial piety is commendable—he is fit to rule the realm. Today, I shall abdicate the throne in favor of Prince Xuánhuǎng. What say you all?”\n\nThe civil and military officials prostrated themselves and replied, “Your Majesty is a ruler of benevolence, and the crown prince is a sovereign of filial devotion. How could this be improper?” The king was greatly pleased and immediately summoned the prince. When the prince arrived at the hall and the ceremonial chants were completed, the king personally presented the imperial seal to him. The prince performed the twenty-four prostrations and knelt to receive the jade seal. The king then retired to the Palace of Repose, while the prince turned to ascend the throne. He issued a general amnesty throughout the land and feasted his assembled ministers. He then decreed the selection of thirty-six palace consorts and seventy-two concubines. Having ascended the throne at the age of fifteen, he governed the realm in peace for another fifteen years.\n\nQueen Regent Fan of the Central Palace bore a son named Jichang, who at twelve years of age was already bright and quick-witted.\n\nThe narrative now turns elsewhere. Thirty years had passed since the Venerable Miaole sent the Three Spirits and Seven Souls of the Patriarch to the Western Glow. Fearing the Patriarch might grow insatiably greedy and lose his original nature, one day the Venerable, gazing from the clouds, saw the king setting out to pay a visit. Riding an auspicious cloud, he descended outside the city of the Western Glow, intending to turn the Patriarch back from his path. From afar, he saw the king’s procession approaching. The Heavenly Venerable transformed himself into a Daoist, sitting motionless by the roadside, silent as a clay Buddha. The advance guards shouted at him to move, but he did not stir. They reported this to the king, who said, “If he fears not the solitary one, he must be a man of the Dao and virtue. Let us go and see.”\n\nWhen the royal carriage drew near, the Daoist still did not rise. The king, observing his dignified bearing, thought him a good man. He ordered his attendants to halt the carriage and alighted to greet the Daoist, who then rose and returned the courtesy. The king asked, “Why do you sit by the road, silent and unmoving? There must be a reason.” The Daoist replied, “I have no other reason, only that I see Your Majesty has taken a wrong turn and wish to point out your error.” The king said, “I have guides to lead the way. How could I have gone astray? Why do you presume to instruct me?” The Daoist answered, “Your guides can only ensure you do not err on the paths of this life in the world of light. I come to guide you on the paths of the next life in the world of darkness.” The king said, “From your words, you claim to know the paths of future lives. Are you then an immortal?” The Daoist replied, “A mountain dweller.” The king asked again, “How can you know the future?” The Daoist said, “To know this life is to know the next; to know the height of joy is to know the depths of sorrow; to know reunion is to know parting. Not only the next life—even a hundred lives hence may be foreseen.” The king said, “How can this be?” The Daoist recited:\n\n*“Fame and profit are but fleeting blooms, gulls on the water;\nWine, lust, wealth, and wrath are oxen that drag one on.\nPleasure passes lightly before the eyes,\nYet in the end, all is but a withered husk.”*\n\nHe added, “Long ago, Emperor Wu of Liang composed these lines.”\n\nThe king, having listened, said, “Since you know the way to transcend life and escape death, return with me to my court and reveal the causes of my past.” Upon hearing this, the Daoist feigned alarm and distress, weeping as he addressed the throne: “Your servant left home at ten and is now forty-five, never once allowing a wayward thought—how could I dare enter the gates of hell?”\n\nThe king, enraged, commanded his imperial guard, Han Tong, to behead the Daoist. The Daoist’s countenance remained unchanged as he replied, “Slaying this poor Daoist is of no matter. But might I ask, Your Majesty—what being were you in a former life?” The king said, “I do not know. Do you?” The Daoist answered, “How could this poor Daoist not know?”\n\nThe king said, “You claim to know a hundred lives—how can this be verified? These are clearly words to evade death.” The Daoist laughed loudly and said, “If there is no proof, then my words must be taken to the grave.” The king asked, “What proof can you offer?” The Daoist said, “Order a basin of water brought, and look into it—you will see.”\n\nThe king, upon hearing this, immediately commanded Han Tong to fetch a basin of water. When it arrived, the Daoist invited the king to gaze into it. The king looked and saw an immortal conversing with the Jade Emperor before a mirror. The Daoist asked, “What does Your Majesty see?” The king replied, “Nothing else—only an immortal speaking with the Jade Emperor.” The Daoist said, “Please look again.” The king peered once more and saw in the basin an ox plowing a field. The Daoist asked again, “What do you see this time?” The king said, “Nothing else—only an ox tilling the soil.” The Daoist said, “Does Your Majesty understand?” The king replied, “I do not.”\n\nThe Daoist said, “The Jade Emperor is but one of Your Majesty’s transformed souls. The immortal is what Your Majesty could cultivate into in this life. If you do not cultivate in this life, in the next you shall become an ox. This reveals the forms of the three existences.”\n\nUpon hearing this, the king’s heart filled with doubt, suspecting the Daoist of practicing sorcery to deceive him into cultivation. He issued a decree ordering Han Tong to step forward and behead the Daoist. As Han Tong approached, the Daoist exhaled a breath, blowing Han Tong to the ground, then rose upon the clouds into the midair.\n\nSeeing the Daoist ascend into the sky, the king’s remorse came too late. He prostrated himself toward the heavens, begging for forgiveness of his past transgressions. The Daoist, suspended in midair, smiled faintly and intoned:\n\n*“Who does not desire wealth and honor?\nWho would willingly bear poverty?\nThe poor may cultivate and grow rich,\nWhile the rich, deluded, end in destitution.\nSupreme fortune meets its decline,\nAnd from decline, fortune returns.\nLofty rank cannot escape death,\nAnd joy’s extremity reveals sorrow.\nOnce beasts, now seen by men,\nLater, men are ranked among beasts.\nIf you cling not to pleasure’s embrace,\nYou may yet avoid the ox’s fate.\nShould you become a beast thus,\nTen thousand kalpas shall not restore you.”*\n\nHearing these words, the king was greatly alarmed. Prostrating himself upon the ground, he pleaded, “This humble one wishes to take refuge under the immortal master. I would abandon my kingdom—where should I cultivate the Way?”\n\nThe Daoist, still suspended in midair, replied, “With a true heart devoted to the Buddha-Dao, enter Vulture Peak early.”\n\nThe king assented repeatedly, obeying the command. Seated upon the Azure Radiance Pavilion, he addressed his assembled ministers: “I now renounce the throne to leave for Vulture Peak. You, my ministers, need not follow. Return to the court and enthrone my eldest son, Jichang, that he may ascend the throne. Each of you must serve the realm with loyal hearts.”\n\nThe ministers prostrated themselves and remonstrated: “Many in the world seek cultivation—how could one of mortal flesh attain immortality? Moreover, Your Majesty rules as sovereign, cherishing the people as your own children. How could you suffer the retribution of rebirth among beasts? This must surely be sorcery. We beg Your Majesty to reconsider carefully, lest you regret it in days to come.”\n\nThe king replied, “My resolve to depart cannot be stayed, nor can your counsel dissuade me. Even in death, I shall not return to the kingdom. Say no more.”\n\nThe ministers had no choice but to comply. They again petitioned: “If Your Majesty must go, allow several hundred men to escort you, that we may set our minds at ease.”\n\nThe king smiled. “While in the kingdom, I knew this body existed; as a renunciate, I shall know it no more. What need have I for an escort? Speak no further.”\n\nThe ministers could only watch as the king departed, their eyes following until he vanished from sight. Then they returned to the court.\n\nThe king, alone, entered the mountains. The Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy was already seated beneath a stone cliff. At the sight of him, the king bowed and said, “I beg the master to guide this disciple, lost upon the path.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied, “You have come. Rise and stand beside me, and listen to my exposition of the Dharma.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy then revealed the original face, expounding upon the cycles of yin and yang, the hells of rebirth, and the practices of asceticism and seated oblivion for self-cultivation. The king prostrated himself in gratitude.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy continued, “Now face the heavens and receive the precepts.” The king knelt before the sky. The Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy administered the Five Precepts on his behalf, expounding the sutras and preaching the Dharma. Then, mounting the clouds, the Heavenly Worthy ascended into the heavens, leaving the king alone in the mountains to cultivate. He ate pine needles when hungry and drank from flowing springs when thirsty.\n\nThe narrative now divides. The ministers returned to the empress and the crown prince, recounting in full the encounter with the Daoist who ascended into the sky and the king’s departure for Vulture Peak. The empress and the crown prince wept bitterly, wishing to prepare an escort and join the prince in searching for the king.\n\nThe ministers advised, “The realm cannot be without a ruler for a single day. If Your Majesty wishes to seek the king’s return, you must first enthrone the crown prince. After forty-nine days, you may then leave the court to search.”\n\nThe empress consented. The crown prince, Jichang, was enthroned, and the era was named the first year of *Sichang*. A general amnesty was declared, and a feast was held for the assembled ministers.\n\nOn the forty-ninth day, the empress commanded the crown prince to visit Vulture Peak and see his father. The prince ascended the throne and issued an edict, ordering the preparation of three carriages: one for himself, one for the empress dowager, and one empty, to await the king’s return. He instructed the officials, great and small, to carry fine incense and burn it along the way. He also commanded the imperial guards Li Tong and Wu Jin to lead three thousand imperial forest troops to escort them to Vulture Peak.\n\nUpon receiving the edict, the ministers arranged orderly processions with reed pipes, flutes, drums, and music, advancing slowly until they reached the foot of Vulture Peak. They searched the entire mountain but found no trace. Later, they came to a place surrounded by verdant pines, where cranes danced on the left and gibbons cried on the right. There stood a great stone cliff, over eight *zhang* deep, within which sat the king upon a meditation mat. His form was no longer human—his bones were emaciated like kindling.\n\nThe empress and the crown prince, seeing him, rushed forward and embraced him, weeping bitterly. The ministers were all moved to sorrow. The empress and the crown prince knelt, pleading for their father to return, but the king sat in silence, uttering not a word.\n\nIn an instant, a great wind arose, and clouds swirled so thickly that faces could not be seen. A violent gust blew the king away—none knew where. When the clouds dispersed and the mist cleared, the empress and the crown prince looked again, but the king was gone. The prince wept aloud.\n\nThe ministers approached and advised, “The clouds and mist obscure all—this is heaven’s will, severing the bond of our king’s love. Now that he has vanished without a trace, he cannot be found. The empress dowager and Your Majesty should return to the court. We shall post proclamations: if anyone learns of the king’s whereabouts, we may then deliberate further. Otherwise, he cannot be found. Grieving will avail you nothing.”\n\nThe prince consented and returned to the court with his mother.\n\nWhat transpired later shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: The Patriarch Attains the Dao and Meets the Emperor**\n\nNow, the crown prince returned to the court. The Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy descended from the midair with the king and said, “You must cultivate diligently. If you achieve merit in three years, I shall return.”\n\nThe king assented repeatedly, obeying the command. Day and night, he sat in arduous cultivation, eating pine needles when hungry and drinking water when thirsty.\n\nTime passed swiftly, and unnoticed, three years had elapsed. One day, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy arrived and asked, “Disciple, do you understand the Dao?”\n\nThe king replied, “I do not.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy asked again, “Do you understand worldly affairs?”\n\nThe king again answered, “I do not.”\n\n“Do you understand life and death?”\n\n“I do not.”\n\n“Do you know you have a body?”\n\n“I do not.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, seeing that the king understood nothing of the affairs between Heaven and Earth, recognized that his heart had died and entered the Dao. With a faint smile, he said, “Your merit is complete.”\n\nThe king asked, “How have I achieved success?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied, “Your heart has turned to cold ashes.”\n\nThe king asked, “What more should I do?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said, “I bestow upon you five auspicious clouds to ascend to the Central Heaven and pay homage to the Jade Emperor.”\n\nThe king, upon hearing this, kowtowed in gratitude. Together with the Heavenly Worthy, he ascended to Heaven. First, they visited the Three Clarities Pavilion to pay respects to the Three Pure Ones, who offered their congratulations. The next day at morning court, the Jade Emperor ascended the throne. After the assembled perfected beings had paid their respects, the Three Pure Ones stepped forward and memorialized, “Your subject, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy, has accepted a disciple—a cultivator from the Kingdom of Western Glow who has attained the Dao—and brings him to see Your Majesty.”\n\nThe Jade Emperor, having heard this, commanded that he be summoned. After the king had thrice prostrated himself, the Emperor asked the assembled immortals, “What rank should he be granted?”\n\nThe immortals memorialized, “This is but one of Your Majesty’s transformed souls; the decision rests with you.”\n\nThe Jade Emperor, startled upon hearing this, bade the king raise his head. Seeing the king’s handsome countenance, he was greatly pleased and immediately enfeoffed him as the Golden Portal Transformed-Body Demon-Quelling Heavenly Worthy. He established for him the Nine Heavens’ Soft-Palace Mansion, entrusting him with governance of that celestial palace and command over thirty-six heavenly generals. He bestowed upon him a black dragon robe, a Seven-Star Sword, and a Seven-Treasures Crown. The king was granted the honor of sharing the Emperor’s seat, walking beside him, and accompanying him in all things. The king expressed his gratitude.\n\nThe Jade Emperor then held a grand feast in celebration. The court dispersed, and this is not further recounted.\n\nThe following day, the Emperor went to the Palace of the Sun. Deng Hua came forth to receive his ancestral master. The Emperor, seeing not a single one of the thirty-six heavenly generals, asked Deng Hua, “I have enfeoffed you here to command the thirty-six heavenly generals. Why do I see not one?”\n\nDeng Hua reported, “Originally, this post was held by one of Your Majesty’s transformed souls. But his heart grew greedy, and he fell to the mortal realm. With no one to command them, the heavenly generals all descended to the world below.”\n\nThe ancestral master said, “Since this is so, I shall address the matter with the Emperor tomorrow.”\n\nThis is not further recounted.\n\nThe next day at dawn, the Jade Emperor ascended the throne. The ancestral master memorialized, “By Your Majesty’s decree, I was sent to the Palace of the Sun to command the thirty-six heavenly generals. But as there was no master to oversee them, they have all fled to the mortal realm. I beg Your Majesty to decide how to proceed.”\n\nThe Jade Emperor, upon hearing this, asked his assembled ministers, “The ancestral master has memorialized thus. What should be done?”\n\nThe ministers replied, “Since the Palace of the Sun is under the ancestral master’s command, if the heavenly generals have fled to the mortal realm, it would be best to send him to retrieve them and return them to the celestial courts.”\n\nThe Emperor assented and ordered the ancestral master to descend to the mortal realm to gather the heavenly generals. The ancestral master, expressing his gratitude, left the court, his heart heavy with worry. Unsure of the whereabouts of the heavenly generals, he thought it best to seek his master, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy, and inquire of the matter. Resolving this, he entered the Tushita Palace.\n\nThe Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy was seated in meditation upon the dharma platform. The ancestral master approached and made a reverent gesture. The Heavenly Worthy asked, “Disciple, why have you come?”\n\nThe ancestral master replied, “It is for no other reason. By Your Majesty’s decree, I was sent to the Palace of the Sun to command the thirty-six heavenly generals. But when I arrived, not one remained. I reported this to the Jade Emperor, who asked his ministers. The ministers advised that I should retrieve them myself. Yet, descending to the mortal realm, I know not their whereabouts. Thus, I have come humbly to seek your guidance, Master.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said, “Had I not told you, you would not have known. You still have forty-two years of tribulation left unfulfilled, which is why this has come to pass. The heavenly generals cannot be retrieved this time; they must instead be reborn into the mortal realm, endure all manner of suffering, and only then may they enter the Realm of Ultimate Bliss.”\n\nThe ancestral master asked, “Where shall I be reborn?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied, “At present, the king of the Pure Luo Kingdom has no heir. His consort, the virtuous Empress Shansheng, burns incense at night and prays to Heaven for a son. You shall transform into a ray of golden light and enter the empress’s womb. In time, when you have grown and your cultivation is complete, you may then ascend to the celestial courts to enjoy your due.”\n\nThe ancestral master, having heard this, could only bow in farewell. He transformed into a ray of golden light, drifting and floating as he flew toward the Pure Luo Kingdom. Empress Shansheng was burning incense in the imperial gardens when she suddenly fell asleep. That ray of golden light entered her womb. The empress dreamed she swallowed a red sun, and from that moment, she conceived.\n\nUnaware, ten months passed. In the twenty-fifth year of the Kaihuang era, on the third day of the third month at noon, the empress of the Pure Luo Kingdom gave birth to a crown prince. The prince emerged from her side, and the empress fainted, her breath stilled. The Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy intoned a spell and blew into the empress’s left side. Gradually, she revived, regaining her senses. The entire palace was enveloped in purple mist, and nine dragons spat foam to bathe the prince. In an instant, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy carried the dragons away through the sky, and the palace returned to its former state. The palace ladies rushed to inform the king.\n\nOverjoyed, the king ordered the prince brought forth. Seeing his refined features and extraordinary bearing, the king was delighted and named him the Mysterious Origin Crown Prince. Unnoticed, spring turned to autumn, and time passed swiftly. The ancestral master, reborn in the Pure Luo Kingdom, was now fourteen years old.\n\nOne year, during the Lantern Festival, the king of the Pure Luo Kingdom ascended the throne. The crown prince came forth and petitioned his father, asking to go and view the lanterns. The king replied, “You are the heir apparent. You must not go out at night to see the lanterns.”\n\nThe crown prince replied, “Let your child disguise as a commoner to go and see the lanterns, then return at once.” The king assented and ordered Commander Tang Bo, along with four eunuchs, to escort the crown prince from the palace to view the lanterns in the marketplace.\n\nAs the crown prince stepped beyond the palace gates, he had not gone the distance of an arrow’s flight before he beheld: resplendent lanterns hung high, flutes and pipes resounding to the heavens. Lovely maidens, fairer than celestial nymphs, drank and reveled with joyous abandon. The crown prince and Tang Bo turned onto South Street, where they saw several drunken men stumbling and reeling, senseless to the world. Turning onto North Street, they witnessed a pair of men brawling over a courtesan in Mengjie’s brothel, each vying for her favor. On East Street, they observed a thief who had stolen a man’s silver pouch, now being beaten mercilessly, his cries for heaven and earth going unheeded.\n\nHaving seen all this, the crown prince suddenly sighed aloud, “How might one escape the four snares of wine, lust, wealth, and wrath? Then why should I be a ruler?” At that moment, the Dipper Mother Heavenly Worthy, who had descended to the mortal realm during the Lantern Festival in the guise of a Daoist to observe the hearts of men, heard the prince’s words. Stepping forward, she bowed and replied, “This poor Daoist just overheard the gentleman say he wished to be free of the four snares of wine, lust, wealth, and wrath. Might you be seeking the method to achieve this? I possess it.”\n\nThe crown prince asked, “How might one be freed from them?” The Daoist replied, “This poor Daoist has abandoned parents, parted from wife and children, and lives by following the currents of fate—is this not freedom?” Before he had finished speaking, Commander Tang Bo, seeing the Daoist’s words urging the crown prince thus, gnashed his teeth and prepared to strike him down. The Daoist, perceiving this, mounted a cloud of auspicious vapor and soared halfway into the sky, revealing his true form. He declared, “The Dao has no root; one must seek it for oneself. If you cling to wealth and nobility, you risk obscuring your true spirit. I am none other than the Dipper Mother Heavenly Worthy.”\n\nUpon seeing this, the crown prince bowed toward the heavens and said, “This disciple is willing to abandon the throne and leave the world.” The Daoist replied, “I depart now. If you do not advance, there will be no place for you in the celestial palace.” The crown prince, greatly startled, returned to the palace with Tang Bo.\n\nAt dawn the next day, the king ascended the throne. The crown prince came forth and reported his encounter with the Daoist, expressing his desire to cultivate the Dao. The king said, “Nowadays, the world is full of demons and heresies. How could celestial immortals descend to deliver mortals? My son, do not be deluded. Would you forsake the nobility of the throne to pursue such fanciful matters? I shall not grant your request.”\n\nThe crown prince petitioned again, “Tales of immortals have long existed, and the practice of cultivation has been passed down since ancient times. How can one dismiss true words and obscure the right path? If one day I should suddenly depart this life, impermanence comes swiftly—how then could I amend past errors? I beg you, Father, to permit me to leave the palace and cultivate the Dao. If one day I achieve success, the nine clans may ascend together.”\n\nSeeing the crown prince’s unwavering resolve to leave the world and cultivate, the king grew furious. He ordered the imperial guard Zheng Cai to imprison the prince in the Cold Palace to suffer hardship, hoping he would change his mind before being pardoned. Zheng Cai immediately confined the prince in the Cold Palace, and the king retired from court.\n\nOnce inside the Cold Palace, the crown prince reflected and sighed, “If there were no yin and yang, how could there be day and night? If there were no heaven, how could there be hell? What I saw the other night—if it were false, there would be no heart urging me to cultivate. There must be some deeper meaning.”\n\nThe Daoist earlier had also said she was Doumu Yuanjun. If Yuanjun had indeed inspired me to cultivate, seeing me imprisoned, she would surely come to my rescue. Why not burn fine incense, pray to heaven, and beseech Yuanjun to descend and guide my path of cultivation?” With this thought, he immediately lit the finest incense and prayed to the heavens. Before his prayer was finished, Yuanjun called from the clouds above, “Crown Prince, now that your father has imprisoned you here, I fear there is little chance of escape. It would be better to obey your father’s command, abandon cultivation, and devise a way to free yourself.”\n\nThe prince replied, “Since I was fortunate enough to meet you, Master, my heart has never wavered. Even in death, I will not obey my father’s command. If he continues to confine me here, I will accept death alone. How could I ever retract my words and heed my father?”\n\nYuanjun said, “If you truly wish to leave the world, this is no place for cultivation.”\n\nThe prince asked, “If this is not a place for cultivation, how can I escape to another?”\n\nYuanjun replied, “If you are willing to go, eighty-five *li* from the city stands a mountain called Wudang, where you may pursue your practice.”\n\nThe prince asked, “How can I reach it?”\n\nYuanjun said, “Close your eyes, and I will take you there.”\n\nThe prince closed his eyes, and Yuanjun, riding a propitious cloud, cradled him in her arms. They left the Cold Palace and arrived at Wudang Mountain. Behold:\n\nGreen peaks rise, their cliffs sheer,\nWillows sway, rare blossoms drift in the breeze.\n\nThe mountains encircle in hues finer than jade, truly a divine creation of immortals.\n\nNow, the prince and Yuanjun arrived at the mountain. The prince bowed to Yuanjun as his master, and from dawn to dusk, they expounded sutras and preached the Dharma, sitting in meditation and cultivation—this shall not be further recounted.\n\nThe narrative now turns to another thread. The following day, the king ascended the throne, and the captain Zheng Cai memorialized, “The prince has vanished.” The king flew into a rage, executed Zheng Cai, and was deeply distressed. His ministers—Zhao Quan, Sun Yue, Feng Yuan, Wang Long, and Wang Rong—stepped forward and petitioned, “If Your Majesty wishes to retrieve the prince, let proclamations be issued and posted throughout the realm. Whoever knows the prince’s whereabouts shall report it and be rewarded with a thousand taels of gold. Whoever harbors the prince shall be granted an official title.” The king approved the memorial and immediately issued the proclamations, posting them along the roads in every direction.\n\nThen, a woodcutter named Chen Chun, who lived at the foot of Wudang Mountain, recalled having seen a man accompanied by a Daoist entering the mountain some days prior. Hearing of the missing prince and the royal proclamation, he surmised that the man he had seen must be the prince. He tore down the proclamation and went to inform the king.\n\nWhat transpired thereafter shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n**The Prince Wears a Yin-Yang Topknot**\n\nOne day, the king ascended the throne and was informed, “Chen Chun, the woodcutter from Wudang Mountain, has seen the prince and comes bearing the proclamation to see Your Majesty.” The king ordered him brought in. After the customary salutations, the king asked, “Since you have torn down the proclamation to see me, have you indeed seen the prince?” Chen Chun replied, “Your subject recently saw a man accompanied by a Daoist entering Wudang Mountain. I believed it to be the prince and have come to report to Your Majesty.” The king said, “Since you saw the two enter the mountain, you shall lead the way. I now command Marshal Tang Bo and Captain Huang Zhong, along with five hundred armored soldiers, to accompany you as guide. Go to Wudang Mountain, find the prince, and return. You shall be richly rewarded upon your return.” Chen Chun expressed his gratitude and departed the court, setting out for Wudang Mountain with the marshal and his men.\n\nUpon entering the mountain, they saw the prince sitting solemnly beneath a cliff, his hair bound in a yin-yang topknot. The soldiers stepped forward and hailed him, but the prince did not utter a word, sitting in silence. Tang Bo ordered the armored soldiers to seize the prince and bring him back to court. In an instant, the sky darkened, and a fierce wind arose, hurling sand and stones from the north. Faces could no longer be discerned, and the debris rained down in chaos. The armored soldiers, along with Tang Bo and the others, covered their heads and ears in terror, fleeing back to the court.\n\nThe next day, the king ascended the throne, and Tang Bo, Chen Chun, and Huang Zhong entered to pay their respects. The king asked, “Did you go to Wudang Mountain and see the prince?” Tang Bo memorialized, “Your servant arrived at Wudang and indeed saw the prince sitting beneath the cliff. I ordered the armored soldiers to bring him back to court, but the prince did not respond. Suddenly, sand and stones flew toward us, and faces could not be seen. We had no choice but to return and report to Your Majesty.” The king, upon hearing this, said, “Since the prince is on Wudang Mountain, I shall once more appoint Chen Chun as guide. Let him accompany the civil and military officials, along with three thousand imperial guards, to escort the prince back to court.” The ministers expressed their gratitude and departed.\n\nThe following day, they assembled the officials, with Chen Chun as guide, and set out for Wudang Mountain. Upon arriving, they entered and saw the prince. After the customary salutations, the prince said, “You have come from afar, my lords. What message do you bring?” The ministers memorialized, “We have received the king’s decree to escort Your Highness back to court.” The prince replied, “Before leaving the kingdom, it was possible, but now, who among those who admire the Dao would dare abandon the Buddha’s teachings to return to the secular world? Heaven and earth are impartial. If even a single thought is impure, does one not bring ruin upon oneself?” The ministers memorialized, “We have heard that when a son leaves home to cultivate the Dao, it is already a grievous act of filial impiety. Now, Your Highness remains resolute in not returning. The king is aged and has no other heir to ascend the throne, and he worries day and night. If misfortune should befall him, who will wear mourning and hold the staff? Who will succeed to the throne? How can Your Highness be certain that you will not be criticized by your ministers or become the subject of public gossip? In this way, Your Highness may not yet have achieved the Dao, but an ill reputation will have already taken shape. We are Your Highness’s loyal subjects and cannot conceal the truth or remain silent when we see it. We beg Your Highness to consider carefully.” Hearing the ministers’ words, the prince could not help but shed tears and said, “I have long known that my father has no son to succeed him. I once asked my master, who said that this year, my father would have a son to inherit the throne. Return and report to my father that he need not worry. You may all return to court. But since I have left the secular world, how can there be any reason for me to return? As ministers and sons, you strive to be loyal but cannot fully fulfill filial piety. How much less can one who has left the world attend to the toils of their parents? If heaven grants our wishes, one day, when I attain the Dao, my parents will both become Buddhas. If not, all is determined by heaven, and I cannot prevent the criticism. Do not speak further. Return to court swiftly, fulfill your duties as loyal ministers, and assist the ruler. If, in the future, my mother bears a younger brother who comes of age to inherit the throne, he will rely on your counsel.”\n\nThe ministers, seeing that the Crown Prince would not be swayed and was determined to leave the secular world, could only bow in farewell and return to court. What became of him later? This will be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\n**The Crown Prince Teased on Mount Wudang**\n\nNow, the King of Jingluo ascended the throne, and his ministers returned to court. Prostrating before the golden steps, they reported, “We journeyed to Mount Wudang and saw the Crown Prince. Though we spoke at length to persuade him, his resolve was firm as the wind passing unheard. He would not return. Seeing his unwavering intent, we informed him of Your Majesty’s lack of an heir. The Crown Prince replied that he had heard from his master that the Queen was with child and would bear a son this year to inherit the throne. Thus, we returned to report to Your Majesty.”\n\nThe King sighed upon hearing this. “If he is so steadfast in his refusal, we cannot press further. As for the claim that the Queen will bear another son, we cannot yet take it as certain. This is no fault of yours.” He then rewarded the woodcutter who had delivered the news by appointing him as a patrol officer, bestowed a catty of silver upon each minister, and granted them three days’ leave from court. The assembled officials expressed their gratitude and withdrew.\n\nTime passed swiftly, and as spring gave way to autumn, the Queen of Jingluo indeed bore another prince. The King rejoiced and named him Xuanxu. In time, he grew to become the King of Jingluo.\n\n---\n\nMeanwhile, the Master, having taken leave of the court officials, returned to the mountain to cultivate in seclusion, where he remained for twenty years. Behind Mount Wudang dwelled the Mountain Saintess, who one day mused to herself, “By the Celestial Worthy’s decree, I was tasked to dwell in the mountain’s rear, secretly accompanying the Master in his cultivation and observing his conduct. Yet from the day he entered the mountain until now—twenty years have passed—he has not once broken a precept, and his merit has grown vast. Tonight, I shall transform into a beautiful woman and go to test him. If his heart stirs with desire and he consorts with me, then with my boundless divine powers, I may roam the world at will—would that not be splendid?”\n\nWith this thought, she recited a true incantation and, with a shake of her body, transformed into a woman—so fair she seemed a reincarnation of Xi Shi, or Guanyin descending from the mountain. Her golden lotuses, three inches bound, trod lightly as she swayed gracefully before the Master’s meditation platform. Feigning sorrowful weeping, she cried, “Master, for heaven’s sake, save this maid!”\n\nThe Master was seated in meditation when the sound of weeping drew near. Startled, he looked up to see a woman and asked in alarm, “Young lady, why have you come here? Night falls—you must leave at once.”\n\nThe woman replied, “My mother is ill, and I was returning home to see her when I lost my way and came here. By good fortune, I have met you, Master. Pray show mercy and allow me to stay the night. Tomorrow, I shall find my way home.”\n\nThe Master said, “This is a place of cultivation. There is only a meditation bed beneath the cliff—how could it accommodate a guest? Moreover, you are a woman, and as the saying goes, ‘Men and women should not touch in passing.’ The hour is not yet late—hasten from this place and seek lodging at the foot of the mountain. Tomorrow, you may return home. Would that not be best?”\n\nThe woman said, “I am but a woman. If I seek lodging elsewhere, it would be improper. Besides, I suffer from a chronic ailment—when I catch a chill, my stomach aches. Today, the weather is cold, and though this place is no proper lodging, I beg you, Master, to show mercy. Loosen your sash and hold me in your arms. If my old illness does not flare tonight, I shall be forever grateful for your kindness.”\n\nThe Master exclaimed, “Amitābha! What words are these? I have cultivated for twenty years. Not only have I not drawn near women, but I have not even shared a bed with men. I cannot comply with your request.”\n\nSeeing that her teasing had no effect, the woman feigned a piteous cry, wailing, “The pain is unbearable! Master, save me!”\n\nThe Master pretended not to hear. The woman called again, “Master, a monastic should save those in disaster and aid those in peril. Why is your heart so hard as iron?”\n\nAfter enduring her pleas for some time, the Master, moved by her pitiful cries, asked, “What remedy have you used in the past for your stomach pain?”\n\nThe woman replied, “When the pain is slight, my husband’s hand pressing upon it brings relief. When the pain is severe, I must press my belly to his for a time before it subsides. Now, the pain has struck, and my husband is not here. No one can press upon it for me. I beg you, Master, press upon it for me. If I may but see my mother again, I shall repay you with my life.”\n\nThe Master said, “I am a monastic. How can I touch a young woman’s body? This is impossible.”\n\nThe woman cried out again, “Master, as the saying goes, ‘Saving a life is greater than building a seven-story pagoda.’ If you do not press upon it soon, I shall surely die of pain!”\n\nSeeing her distress, the Master relented and stepped forward, pressing upon her for a moment. The woman cried out again, “The pain is severe—pressing does not stop it. As they say, ‘Save a life to the end.’ I beg you, Master, loosen your sash and press against me for a while. The pain will then cease.”\n\nThe Master replied, “If that is the case, I would sooner die than comply.” He strode out beneath the moonlight and sighed, “I left my kingdom and cultivated for over twenty years, yet instead of encountering the Dao, I am entangled by others. This is no path to enlightenment. I should descend the mountain and seek another way.”\n\nHaving spoken thus, he paid the woman no further heed and departed, stepping down the mountain. Seeing the Master storm off in anger, the woman cried out in alarm, “I have committed a grave sin! This man has cultivated for over twenty years, and the celestial scriptures were soon to be bestowed upon him. Now I have trifled with him—if he leaves, all his past efforts will be undone. Should the Venerable Miaole of the Heavens learn of this, how shall I answer? I had better transform into an old woman and intercept him on the path to turn him back, thereby atoning for my transgression.”\n\nWith these words, she recited a true incantation, assuming the form of an old woman. She turned a rotting log into an iron pestle and, riding the clouds, hastened ahead to a spot on the path. There, she ground the pestle back and forth upon a stone. The Master, descending the mountain in fury, had just begun his journey when he saw the old woman grinding the iron pestle on the rock. He halted, pondering what use it could serve. Drawing near, he asked, “Venerable elder, I see you grinding this iron pestle here—what purpose does it serve?”\n\nThe old woman replied, “My granddaughter asked me for a sewing needle, but we have none at home. So I am grinding this iron pestle into a needle for her use.”\n\nThe Master laughed upon hearing this. “How many days will it take for an iron pestle to become a needle? Do not waste your energy.”\n\nThe old woman said, “I know it is difficult, but since I have already promised my granddaughter, how can I abandon the task halfway? With patience, it will surely be accomplished one day.”\n\nThe Master, hearing this, asked no further questions and continued on his way. Seeing that this attempt had failed to turn him back, the Celestial Mother transformed again, this time into an old man. Riding the clouds, she alighted three *li* ahead, where she took up an iron hammer in one hand and an awl in the other, boring into the rock by the path. When the Master arrived, he saw the old man drilling the rock and, not understanding his intent, approached and asked, “Elder, why are you boring into this rock with an awl?”\n\nThe old man replied, “I am too old to till several *mu* of dry fields, and there is no water to irrigate them. So I am boring a channel through this rock to bring water to the fields.”\n\nThe Master laughed and asked, “When will this be accomplished?”\n\nThe old man said, “As the saying goes, ‘With perseverance, even stone can be pierced.’ How can it not be done? I have been laboring at this for over a month. If I were to abandon it because of your words, would I not waste all my previous efforts? I shall not heed your remark but will redouble my diligence. One day, it will surely be accomplished. How could I give up halfway and forsake my past labors?”\n\nThe Master stood in contemplation for a long while. He mused to himself, “Since descending the mountain, I have witnessed two things—grinding a pestle and boring a rock—both arduous tasks. Yet neither would abandon their efforts because of a single word. I am a monastic, yet I fled in anger over a woman, casting aside my past cultivation. It would be better to return to the mountain and resume my practice, to see what may come of it.”\n\nHaving resolved this, he turned back and returned to the mountain to continue his cultivation. The Celestial Mother of the mountain, seeing that the Master’s heart had returned, was overjoyed. She resumed her true form and once more concealed herself behind the mountain, whereupon no more is said of her.\n\nNow, the Venerable Miaole, observing from the clouds that the Master’s merit was complete and he was gradually entering the Dao, saw that he had yet to refine the viscera within his five organs. The Heavenly Venerable displayed his divine power, reciting an incantation. From the void, he summoned two sleep-inducing insects, which flew toward the Master and alighted upon him. Instantly, the Master fell into a deep slumber, oblivious to all.\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable then summoned the Belly-Slicing Spirit and handed him a sacred sword, instructing him to open the Master’s abdomen. The Belly-Slicing Spirit received the command, untied the Master’s sash, and split open his chest. He removed the intestines and placed them beneath a rock, covering them with a stone. Then, taking a strip of the Master’s robe, he fashioned it into a stomach, and a length of his sash into intestines, sewing them into place. The Heavenly Venerable then took out a pill of returning spirit and placed it in the Master’s mouth, ordering the Belly-Slicing Spirit to withdraw.\n\nReciting a true incantation, the Heavenly Venerable revived the Master in an instant. The Master awoke to find the Heavenly Venerable beside him. He promptly rose and bowed, saying, “This disciple has erred in failing to greet you from afar.”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said, “I instructed you not to sleep at night—why have you fallen asleep in broad daylight?”\n\nThe Master replied, “In the past, I felt my mind serene and did not sleep day or night. I do not know why today I suddenly grew so weary and fell into a slumber from which I could not awaken.”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said, “You must not do so again.”\n\nThe Master replied, “From now on, I shall reform.”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said, “Cultivate for a few more years, and you will surely attain the immortal rank. I bestow upon you this sacred sword—keep it with you always. Should you encounter evil demons, wield it and they shall depart.”\n\nThe Master bowed in gratitude, and the Heavenly Venerable rode away upon the clouds.\n\nUnaware that his viscera had been replaced by the Heavenly Venerable, the Master continued his arduous cultivation day and night, sitting in meditation. Gradually, he felt his body grow lighter, and a five-colored cloud often enveloped him. Beasts from all directions came to pay homage, and day and night, he heard the sutras and the Dharma.\n\nOn this mountain, there was a child who was in truth a bamboo spirit. Since the Master had arrived to cultivate here, the spirit had listened to the Dharma morning and evening and had gained a modicum of divine power. One day, it transformed into a woman, approaching from the western path, weeping bitterly. Drawing near, she cried out to the Master, “Save me, Master!”\n\nThe Master asked, “Young lady, why have you come here?”\n\nThe woman replied, “My husband is forcing me to remarry, but I refused to comply. So I fled through the back gate, intending to return to my parents’ home.”\n\n\"I never expected to take the wrong path and end up here. The sky has grown dark, and a heavy rain pours down—there is nowhere for me to take shelter. I beg you, Master, allow me to stay the night. Tomorrow, I will leave at first light.\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"This is a place for reciting sutras and expounding the Dharma. It would not be proper to accommodate you.\"\n\nThe woman paid no heed to his words and attempted to enter the meditation platform. Fearing she might be a ghost or demon, the Master raised his sacred sword, ready to strike her dead. But as he looked closely, he saw only a large bamboo stalk. Only then did the Master’s mind settle.\n\nTime flew like an arrow, days and months like a shuttle. The Master returned to the mountain to cultivate for another twenty years.\n\nOne day, a eel spirit transformed into a woman, her body draped in mourning clothes. Weeping bitterly, she approached the Master’s meditation platform and bowed her head in reverence.\n\nThe Master asked, \"Young lady, where have you come from? Why do you bow before this poor monk?\"\n\nThe woman answered, \"My family of six was struck by pestilence, and four have already perished. Now, only my young son remains, a child of three, lying ill in bed with no one to turn to. I have heard that you, Master, have recited sutras and expounded the Dharma on this mountain for forty years, attaining the true Way. I come humbly to seek your aid—pray, let your heart be moved with compassion. Visit my humble home and recite a volume of the true sutra. If you save my son’s life, I will be forever grateful, and in the next life, I shall repay you with boundless devotion.\"\n\nHearing this, the Master’s heart was moved with pity. He asked, \"How far is the journey to your home?\"\n\nThe woman replied, \"Not far—only five *li* away.\"\n\nThe Master asked, \"How many households live in your dwelling?\"\n\nThe woman answered, \"Only mine.\"\n\nThe Master said, \"If yours is the only household, then I, as a monk, cannot comply with your request.\"\n\nThe woman replied, \"As the saying goes: *To save a single life is greater than building a seven-tiered pagoda.* How could this be improper?\"\n\nThe Master refused again and again.\n\nThe woman wept bitterly before the meditation platform, pleading again and again. The Master remained unmoved, sitting with downcast eyes. From noon until dusk, she wailed without cease. As the sky darkened, she said, \"Master, since you refuse to descend, I have lingered here too long. Night has fallen, and I cannot return home. What am I to do?\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"Young lady, you may still make haste and return.\"\n\nThe woman said, \"Master, you are steadfast in your refusal, and I dare not persist. But the main road below the mountain is one I can traverse alone—yet the mountain paths have left me lost. I beg you to guide me out, and I shall return on my own.\"\n\nHearing this, the Master had no choice but to rise from the platform. Taking up his sword, he led the woman down the mountain. Halfway there, she seized his shoulders from behind and said, \"My feet ache with pain. I beg you to support me for a few steps.\"\n\nThe Master was startled and replied, \"This poor monk has lived forty years in seclusion, never touching another. How could I support you? Walk slowly instead.\"\n\nThe woman said, \"Master, your words are just. But my feet truly cannot carry me. If you refuse to help me down, then let us return to the mountain and spend the night at the meditation platform. Tomorrow, I shall go home alone.\"\n\nThe Master could not comply with either request. The woman then said, \"You refuse to help me down, and you refuse to return with me. Master, I see you are no ordinary man—your bearing is noble, your features refined. My heart stirs with desire. I beg you to satisfy my longing for this moment, and then I shall return home. What say you?\"\n\nThe Master made no reply, turning to leave. The woman revealed her divine power, rushing forward to seize him. With a spell of binding, she said, \"I have humbled myself before you, like a falling flower with intent. Why do you remain as heartless as flowing water?\"\n\nThe Master, ensnared by her, felt his body grow heavy, unable to break free. Suddenly, he remembered the sword at his waist. Drawing it forth, the woman vanished, and his spirit returned to clarity. He returned to the meditation platform without further mention.\n\nNow, the Venerable Miaole observed from the clouds how the Master’s heart remained unmoved, his integrity unshaken. One day, as the Jade Emperor ascended his throne, the Venerable Miaole presented a memorial: \"Your Majesty, a fragment of your soul has completed its cultivation, free from even the slightest worldly thought. You should swiftly dispatch divine generals to escort him to the celestial courts and grant him rank and office.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor, overjoyed, commanded the Azure Dragon of the East, the Vermilion Dragon of the South, the White Dragon of the West, the Black Dragon of the North, and the Yellow Dragon of the Center to bear the Venerable Miaole’s carriage. He further ordered the Great White Star of the West to present a seal inscribed with the four characters *Master of the Jade Void*. The Banner-General Shigu was tasked with holding a flag to descend and welcome the Master.\n\nThe courtiers received their orders and departed.\n\nOne day, as the Master combed his hair upon a cliff, he suddenly reflected on his mortal form’s futility. His resolve faltered, and he ceased grooming, tossing the comb aside. After a long sigh, he gazed down at the sheer drop—over ten *zhang* deep. Just then, a celestial decree arrived, and the five dragons lifted him aloft. The Master, seeing the edict, knelt to receive it.\n\nThe decree read: \"As the ancient saying goes, *Heaven fulfills the good intentions of men.* Reward follows good and evil, for the cosmos is impartial. We have witnessed Yuanxuan’s forty years of ascetic practice, untouched by even the faintest worldly thought. His sincerity is evident, and he is fit for a celestial rank. We now dispatch the five dragons to bear him, the Golden Star to hold his seal, and Shigu to carry his banner. We appoint him as the *Master of the Five Voids, Mysterious Heavenly Emperor of the North*, overseeing thirty-six celestial generals and eighty-two transformations. On the ninth day of the ninth month and the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month each year, he shall traverse the mortal realm to inspect good and evil. His original abode shall be the Palace of the Sun, with a stipend of a thousand measures of grain. He shall enter the Western Heaven to receive the precepts and ascend with his nine clans.\"\n\nThe Master, having heard the decree, kowtowed in gratitude. Turning to groom himself, he found his hair would not stay bound. Startled, the Venerable Miaole said, \"Disciple, I did not foresee this. Once the celestial edict arrived, your mortal form could no longer be altered. How could you comb it again?\"\n\nThe Master bowed in thanks. The Venerable Miaole then ascended to Heaven upon a cloud.\n\nAt dawn the next day, the Jade Emperor held court. The Venerable Miaole presented the Master before him. The Emperor asked, \"Who is this?\"\n\nThe Venerable replied, \"This is Yuanxuan, whom I was commanded to bring from Mount Wudang to see Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor, delighted, descended from his throne to raise the Master, inviting him to sit upon a brocade cushion. A grand imperial banquet was held to honor the assembled ministers. A decree was issued to escort the Master to the Palace of the Sun.\n\nThe following day, the Master ascended his seat in the Palace of the Sun. The gatekeepers announced the arrival of the assembled Venerables to offer congratulations. The Master received them, and as they conversed, a sudden surge of resentment from the north pierced the heavens. The Master was alarmed and asked the celestial lords, \"I have only just arrived in this celestial realm. Why does this unceasing resentment rise from the north?\"\n\nThe celestial lords replied, \"Your Majesty is unaware—this is the resentment of the mortal realm. Emperor Sui Tang rules with tyranny, deluded and murderous. Thus, this miasma lingers.\"\n\nBefore they could finish, demonic vapors surged from all four directions.\n\nThe Master then asked, \"And now demonic vapors arise—what is the cause?\" The celestial lords replied, \"These demonic vapors are the emanations of the Heavenly Emperor’s generals, who have incited chaos across the four quarters of the mortal realm. Hence, these vapors arise.\"\n\nThe Master said, \"That both demonic and resentful qi surge toward the heavens is no auspicious sign. It cannot be tolerated long—what should be done?\" The celestial lords answered, \"If one possessed of divine power were to descend to the mortal realm and eradicate these two qi, the merit would be immeasurable, and the Three Realms would know peace.\"\n\nThe Master said, \"Since these demonic vapors stem from my own generals, how could I hesitate to act? Tomorrow, I shall seek an audience with the Heavenly Emperor and descend to the mortal realm to purge these two qi. Would this not be fitting?\" The celestial lords rejoiced and, taking their leave, returned to their grottoes.\n\nThe following day, the Jade Emperor ascended his throne. The Master stepped forward from the ranks, his court boots striking the ground, his ivory tablet held before his chest. He memorialized, \"Yesterday, upon arriving at the Palace of the Sun, I beheld demonic and resentful qi surging from the mortal realm. Such omens are inauspicious for the celestial realm and must be eradicated. I have heard that these demonic vapors arise from my own generals, who have sown chaos across the four quarters of the mortal realm. I volunteer to descend and recall my generals, expel the perverse, and destroy the demonic, returning thereafter to present myself before Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe Five Emperors, upon hearing this, were greatly pleased. They bestowed upon him the Three Terraces Seven Stars Sword, a suit of golden chainmail, five hundred Fire Elixir pellets, and appointed him as the Great General Zhenwu of the Northern Direction. Three cups of imperial wine were offered, and the Master, having expressed his gratitude, departed the court.\n\nThe Master left the celestial realm and went to the Three Clarities Abbey to take leave of the Three Clarities. After exchanging greetings, the Three Clarities inquired as to his purpose. The Master recounted his audience with the Jade Emperor and his intent to descend to the mortal realm to subdue the demons. The Three Clarities asked, \"Who will accompany you?\" The Master replied, \"I shall go alone, for I have no deputy. I have come to seek your counsel—how should I proceed?\"\n\nThe Three Clarities said, \"This is not difficult. During your cultivation on Mount Wudang, you once discarded your entrails beneath a cliff. Over time, infused with spiritual qi, your belly became a turtle demon and your intestines a snake demon, both of which now wreak havoc in the mortal realm. If you descend, retrieve these two creatures to serve as your generals, and you will surely succeed.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the Master bowed in farewell and rode the clouds down the mountain. Reciting an incantation, he transformed into a Daoist priest. What transpired thereafter will be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\n**The Master Descends to Subdue the Two Demons**\n\nNow, the turtle and snake demons were one day admiring themselves in the Cave of Water and Fire. The snake said, \"Brother, we were born beneath the cliffs of Mount Wudang, and for years, we have grown in might. Today, our divine powers are vast, and our transformations boundless. Yet, we lack a lady to share our joy, and this displeases me greatly.\"\n\nThe turtle demon replied, \"Wise brother, you speak truly. Let us command the lesser demons to scour the households for beautiful women, and we shall take two for our pleasure.\" Delighted, the two immediately dispatched the lesser demons to investigate.\n\nNow, Prefect Lin Biao of Caozhou had a daughter, Miss Jinju, aged eighteen, in the bloom of youth, with rosy lips and white teeth, surpassingly beautiful. Similarly, Magistrate Zhao Mo had a daughter, aged sixteen, named Jiaoniang, whose bearing was enchanting, her brows and eyes exquisitely formed. One day, the two young ladies were admiring flowers in the garden when the lesser demons spied them. They hastened back to report to the two demons, who immediately rode their demonic clouds to the scene.\n\nIndeed, the two maidens were playing in the rear garden, their beauty beyond compare. Overjoyed, the demons displayed their powers, reciting incantations that summoned a fierce wind. The gale was so violent that faces could not be seen, and all the maidservants were blown to the ground. The two young ladies, clutching each other, attempted to flee the garden, but the demons each seized one and carried them away upon the clouds. In an instant, the wind stilled, the mist dispersed, and the maidservants, finding their mistresses gone, were struck with terror. They rushed to inform the prefect and magistrate.\n\nThe\n\nThe City God said, \"Go and investigate. If it is indeed them who took the ladies, order them to return the two girls at once.\" The Local Deity replied, \"Those two demons are insatiable in devouring humans and possess vast supernatural powers—how could they willingly return them?\" The City God asked, \"Then what is to be done?\" The Local Deity answered, \"To retrieve the two young ladies, nothing short of heavenly troops besieging the Water-Fire Cave will suffice. Perhaps then they may relent; otherwise, it will be impossible.\"\n\nThe City God followed this advice and immediately mustered his divine soldiers, surrounding the cave entrance of Mount Wudang with battle cries shaking the heavens. The forces then split into two divisions.\n\nMeanwhile, the Turtle and Serpent Demons, having seized the two young ladies, returned in high spirits. They prepared a grand feast, intending to force the two maidens into marriage. Though the ladies refused even unto death, the Serpent Demon sought to devour them. The Turtle Demon said, \"Brother, do not be hasty. No wonder they resist—they are sheltered daughters, suddenly snatched away by us. Their tears have not yet dried; how could they willingly wed us? Command the lesser she-demons to attend them for a month or so, and their hearts will naturally turn. Why rush? Now that they are in our cave, where could they flee?\"\n\nThe Serpent Demon, greatly pleased, ordered the she-demons to serve them. As the two demons drank, battle cries erupted outside the cave. A lesser demon rushed in to report: \"The City God of this prefecture, having learned that the two great kings have seized the young ladies, has led divine troops here. He demands the immediate release of the two ladies, or else he will storm the cave and leave not even a blade of grass standing!\"\n\nEnraged, the Turtle and Serpent Demons roused their demonic troops and charged out of the cave, forming ranks. The two demons cursed, \"You are but a mortal official, rewarded with a post in the netherworld for your loyalty. We are born of heaven and earth, having achieved success through the Dharma. Our cave lacks mistresses, so we took the daughters of the prefect and magistrate—what concern is it of yours? How dare you besiege our cave with troops!\"\n\nThe City God replied, \"How bold you demons are! Born of calamity, you have brought misfortune upon the prefect and magistrate, whose petition reached my court. How could I not investigate? Release the two young ladies at once, and all will be forgiven. Refuse, and in but a moment, you will be dragged before the heavenly courts, where even your mouths will be silenced!\"\n\nThe two demons, hearing this, lunged forward with their spears. The City God met them with his blade. From noon till dusk, neither side gained the upper hand. Then the two demons displayed their powers: the Turtle transformed into a great mountain, while the Serpent coiled atop it, charging forward. The City God, unable to withstand the assault, fled in defeat. The two demons did not pursue but withdrew their forces into the cave.\n\nThe City God returned to his court, deeply troubled. The Local Deity of Wudang reported, \"My lord, do not despair. I have learned that the Dark Heavenly Emperor, ordered by the Jade Emperor to descend and purge demonic qi, has taken the form of a Daoist and now resides in the Three Clarities Temple. He must possess great power. My lord should seek his aid, and if he comes, these two demons will surely be subdued.\"\n\nThe City God, hearing this, immediately went to the Three Clarities Temple to see the Patriarch. The Patriarch asked, \"City God, why have you come?\" The City God replied, \"This humble official has been troubled by the two demons of the Water-Fire Cave on Mount Wudang, who have abducted the daughter of Prefect Lin Biao and the daughter of Magistrate Zhao Mo. A petition reached my court, and I led troops to retrieve them, but I was no match for them. Hearing that the Emperor has descended to eliminate demons, I have come to beseech his aid, to save the lives of the two young ladies and swiftly extend his compassion.\"\n\nThe Patriarch replied, \"Return now. I shall go to the Water-Fire Cave at once.\" The City God bowed in gratitude and departed.\n\nThe Patriarch recited true incantations, grasped his Seven-Star Sword, and rode the clouds straight to the Water-Fire Cave to do battle. A lesser demon reported to the two demons, who emerged from the cave. Behold the Patriarch’s appearance: in his hand, the Seven-Star Sword; upon his body, a golden-yellow armor and brocade robe; his brows clear, his eyes bright, his form radiant with golden light. Who was this divine being descended to the world? None other than the Great General Zhenwu of the Dark Heaven.\n\nThe Daoist called out loudly, \"You two demons, cease your rudeness! By the Jade Emperor’s decree, I have come to subdue demons. Surrender at once to avoid heavenly execution!\"\n\nThe two demons replied, \"You belong to the upper realms, while we dwell in the mortal world. What grudge do we bear against you that you seek us out?\"\n\nThe Patriarch said, \"The heavenly law states: 'Demons who bewitch and abduct the daughters of good families, devouring human flesh and blood, shall be cast into Fengdu for five hundred years before they may become beasts again.' If you do not reflect upon yourselves, how dare you still act so insolently?\"\n\nHearing this, the two demons flew into a rage and charged forward with their spears. The Patriarch pointed his sword, summoning the fire of Bing and Ding. The Turtle, being of water, fled at the sight of true fire; the Serpent, a fire star, feared it not and pressed forward with even greater vigor. The Patriarch then pointed his sword toward the north, summoning the water of Ren and Gui. The Serpent, seeing the true water arrive, could not withstand it and fled.\n\nSeeing the two demons retreat, the Patriarch stormed into the cave, where he found the two young ladies weeping bitterly. He asked the reason, and the two girls recounted how they had been admiring flowers when they were seized. The Patriarch said, \"Young ladies, do not weep. I am the Dark Heavenly Emperor, the True Martial General of the North. The Turtle and Serpent Demons have been driven away by me.\"\n\n\"Now close your eyes, and I shall send you home.\" The two young ladies, upon hearing this, bowed in gratitude and closed their eyes. The Patriarch intoned the true incantation and, riding two auspicious clouds, conveyed the two maidens back to Caozhou Prefecture. There, Golden Chrysanthemum was reunited with her father. Magistrate Lin asked, \"You have been gone for three days, and we saw no trace of you—how is it you have returned home?\"\n\nGolden Chrysanthemum replied, \"Daughter and Young Mistress Jiao’er went to the rear garden to admire the flowers when suddenly a fierce wind arose, so thick we could not see one another. We were seized by two demons from Mount Wudang—the Turtle and the Serpent. Father, you petitioned the City God, but even he could not overcome the demons. Later, the Dark Heavenly Emperor, the True Martial General of the Upper Realm, drove the two demons away, rescued us upon clouds, and brought us home, so that we might live to see you again.\"\n\nThe magistrate was overjoyed and asked, \"What did your rescuer look like?\"\n\nThe young lady answered, \"When the deity arrived, he had crimson lips and white teeth, his hair flowing down his back, a fair complexion with three strands of beard, clad in a purple robe with a jade belt, and wielding the Seven-Star Sword.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the magistrate immediately left the hall to summon the judicial commissioner. After a short while, the commissioner arrived, and they exchanged greetings.\n\nThe magistrate recounted to the judicial commissioner how his daughter had been rescued by the True Martial General. The commissioner said, \"Your daughter’s account matches word for word what my own daughter told me. Now that we have been saved by a heavenly deity, we ought to build a temple in gratitude.\"\n\nThe magistrate replied, \"Your Excellency speaks rightly.\" He then ordered Xu Dexun to gather laborers and materials to construct a temple outside the northern gate, with three halls and five beams. A statue was sculpted of the deity—hair unbound, sword in hand. The magistrate, the commissioner, their daughters, and their households all went to offer incense and give thanks. From then on, those who prayed there found their pleas answered without fail, and the temple’s incense has never ceased burning.\n\nMeanwhile, the two demons, driven away by the Patriarch, had nowhere to take refuge and seethed with resentment. The Serpent Demon said, \"We are starving and have no shelter. Brother, why not transform yourself into a ferryboat and me into a bamboo pole? We can wait at Sanli Creek for travelers to cross. When we reach midstream, we’ll sink the boat and devour them—both a meal and a refuge. What could be better?\" Delighted, the Turtle Demon transformed into a ferryboat and the Serpent into a pole, and they waited.\n\nThe Patriarch, having escorted the two young ladies home, returned to pursue the demons. Riding the clouds, he saw them disguised as a ferry and pole. A faint, cold smile crossed his lips. He halted his cloud, descended, and transformed into a Daoist priest. Stepping aboard, he seized the pole and slowly poled to midstream. The Turtle Demon rejoiced, preparing to display his power and sink the boat. But the Patriarch, seeing this, uttered a true incantation and brandished his Three Terraces Seven-Star Sword, his body swelling to ten thousand *zhang*. The Serpent, now the pole in his grasp, panicked and leapt into the water. The Turtle Demon reverted to his true form and tried to drag the Patriarch under. The Patriarch revealed his divine power—his head touched the Thirty-Three Heavens, his feet spanned the Five Lakes and Four Seas—pinning the Turtle and Serpent to the creek bed, leaving them no escape.\n\nSeeing this, the Serpent Demon soared into the air and cried, \"A celestial decree arrives!\" The Patriarch, hearing of the decree, reached out to receive it. The moment he did, the Turtle Demon slipped away. Realizing he had been tricked, the Patriarch was filled with regret, but the demon was already gone. He searched along the way but found no trace.\n\nThe two demons, having escaped, conferred and hid in an old well, waiting for someone to draw water so they could seize and devour them. The local earth god was alarmed and set out to report to the Sheji, but he encountered the Patriarch on the road. The earth god knelt to greet him. The Patriarch asked, \"Have you seen the whereabouts of the Turtle and Serpent Demons in this area?\" The earth god replied, \"The two demons are hiding in the well here, plotting to harm the villagers. I was just about to report to the Sheji.\" The Patriarch said, \"No need. Lead me to the well.\" The earth god guided him there.\n\nThe Patriarch drew his Three Terraces Seven-Star Sword, recited a true incantation, and pointed at the well. The two demons emerged and confronted him. The Patriarch pointed his sword south, then north—water and fire surged forth, and the demons fled in defeat. He pursued them, but they hid within a lotus root. Seeing this, he plucked the lotus and hacked it to pieces from stem to tip. The demons, trapped inside, panicked. They shrank themselves to the size of a millet grain, but the Patriarch pried one open—there they were. They leapt to the ground and fled. The Patriarch gave chase until he reached a pomegranate tree, where he saw them hiding among the fruit. He pointed his sword from south to north—water and fire erupted, shaking the branches and leaves, casting a crimson glow. The tree, roots and all, was engulfed, and the demons, fearing water and fire, could not escape. The Patriarch chanted an incantation, and the flames and waves intensified. The Turtle, afraid of fire, and the Serpent, afraid of water, could endure no more and cried out in misery.\n\nThe Patriarch asked, \"Will you surrender?\" The demons answered in unison, \"We willingly submit to the Heavenly Emperor.\" The Patriarch ceased the water and fire. The demons emerged and prostrated themselves before him. He asked, \"Do you truly submit?\" They replied, \"We will forever follow the Heavenly Emperor and dare not rebel.\" The Patriarch said, \"If you are sincere, reveal your true forms for me to see.\" At his command, the Serpent reverted to his original shape—golden scales, iron bones, and a single horn—while the Turtle’s back bore the Eight Trigrams of the Nine Palaces, with three eyes and three tails.\n\nSeeing their true forms, the Patriarch restrained them with his Seven-Star Sword and took out two Fire Elixirs, giving one to each. He instructed, \"You have just consumed my Fire Elixirs. If you ever rebel, call out ‘Fire,’ and you will perish instantly.\" The demons bowed in submission. The Patriarch took them to the celestial court and reported the events to the Jade Emperor. Delighted, the Jade Emperor appointed the Turtle and Serpent Demons as the Water and Fire Generals, to accompany the Patriarch in his divine work. After the Patriarch and the two demons expressed their gratitude, the Jade Emperor said, \"A dark *qi* still rises from the mortal realm. Who else remains?\"\n\n\"Proceed to subdue and disperse all the dark *qi*.\" The Patriarch stepped forward and reported, \"This humble servant, though unworthy, volunteers to descend once more to the mortal realm and eradicate the dark *qi*, returning to court thereafter.\" The Jade Emperor, greatly pleased upon hearing this, immediately bestowed three cups of imperial wine. The Patriarch expressed his gratitude, withdrew, and with the Water and Fire Generals in tow, arrived at the Hall of the Three Pure Ones to pay homage to the Three Clarities.\n\nUnbeknownst what would transpire next, we leave the tale here and shall reveal more in the following chapter.\n\n**The Patriarch Descends to Subdue the Dark Qi**\n\nThe story continues: Having received the decree, the Patriarch went to the Three Clarities’ abode to seek an audience with the Three Pure Ones. The Supreme Clarity inquired, \"Why have you come here today?\" The Patriarch replied, \"This disciple has subdued the Water and Fire Generals and returned to report to the Jade Emperor. Seeing the dark *qi* surging from the mortal realm, the Jade Emperor issued a decree commanding its suppression. This disciple has accepted the mission and wishes to descend to the world below to disperse the dark *qi*. Yet I do not know the source of this *qi* nor how to subdue it, and so I humbly seek my master’s guidance.\"\n\nThe Supreme Clarity said, \"This *qi* flows from north to south, from west to east—it is not merely the emanation of a single source but the manifestation of countless evils stirring chaos.\" The Patriarch asked, \"Why has such *qi* gathered thus?\" The Supreme Clarity replied, \"This *qi* arises from the Black Malevolence Spirit, who rampages in the mortal world under the title of Black-Faced Mountain King. He commands seven generals: the first named Li Bian, the second Bai Qi, the third Liu Da, the fourth Zhang Yuanbo, the fifth Shen Shigui, the sixth Shi Wengong, and the seventh Fan Chenqing. The Malevolence Spirit himself is named Zhao Gongming, styled Wenming. Since departing the celestial realm for the mortal world, he has gone unrestrained, wreaking havoc day and night and tormenting the people. However, when he descended, he did not bring his magical treasures with him. Now, he and his seven generals have settled in Wind-Clear Cave in Xuzhou Prefecture, insatiably devouring humans. They often dispatch lesser demons to patrol the riverbanks, seizing and consuming any who attempt to cross. In West Peace Alley of Xuzhou Prefecture lives a man named Zhan Lisheng, who has long practiced virtue and accumulated merit. He travels as a merchant, and since your attainment of the Dao, he has sculpted your likeness and offered incense in your honor. Now, he must cross the river on urgent business, but Gongming has stationed one of his generals to patrol the waters. If Zhan Lisheng attempts the crossing, he will surely fall victim to their predation. You must descend at once to the riverbank: first, to save this man’s life and not betray the goodwill of your devotee; second, to subdue this demonic horde—would this not be a most excellent outcome?\"\n\nThe Patriarch, having heard this, bowed his head in gratitude, departed from the Three Clarities Abbey, and instructed his Water and Fire Generals. With a shake of their forms, they transformed into three travelers, who hailed a boatman by the riverbank. From the mighty Yangtze, a solitary skiff drifted toward them. At its prow stood a boatman, bamboo pole in hand, guiding the vessel gently to shore. Suddenly, a gust of black qi surged forth, concealing seven figures who lunged forward to seize the Patriarch and his companions.\n\nAs the demonic qi drew near, the Patriarch revealed his divine power. Brandishing his Three Terraces Seven Stars Sword, with the Water General to his left and the Fire General to his right, he cut down the horde of demons, who fled in disarray, unable to withstand the onslaught. They scurried back into the Clear Wind Cave and reported all that had transpired. Upon hearing this, Zhao Gongming flew into a rage, donned his armor, and charged into battle. There he met the Patriarch, hurling curses without end.\n\nThe Patriarch said, “You are a celestial spirit of slaughter—why abandon your post to sow chaos in the mortal realm? You have violated the celestial statutes. Dismount now and surrender, and I shall escort you to the heavenly courts. All will be forgiven. Refuse, and your life shall be forfeit in but a moment.”\n\nEnraged, Zhao Gongming raised his iron mace and struck at the Patriarch, who met the blow with his sword. They clashed for over thirty rounds, neither gaining the upper hand. Zhao Gongming pondered for a moment, then secretly commanded his subordinate Li Bian to reveal his true form—a tiger-tailed whip with thirty-two segments, thirty-three *zhang* in length, light as a goose feather in the wielder’s hand yet crushing as Mount Tai to those struck. Displaying his divine prowess, he engaged the Patriarch in battle.\n\nUpon seeing this, the Patriarch ordered the Serpent Spirit to manifest its true form—a serpent thirty-two *zhang* long, coiling tightly around the whip, its weight like Mount Tai, nearly crushing Li Bian to death. Gasping for breath, Li Bian transformed back into his original shape and broke free from the serpent’s coils, fleeing in haste. The Patriarch pressed the attack, and Zhao Gongming, unable to resist, abandoned the cave and fled upon a propitious cloud.\n\nThe Patriarch stormed into the cave and instructed the Tortoise and Serpent Generals: “The fiend has been routed and will surely descend forty *li* away by cloud. You two must hasten there at once. Let the Serpent Spirit transform into a great mountain, and the Tortoise Spirit into a jujube. I shall turn this Seven Stars Sword into a temple called the Tongxian Abbey. I will disguise myself as a Daoist priest, reciting scriptures within. The fiend will inevitably come to the abbey for tea. Once he drinks, you shall roll into his belly—only then can we subdue him.”\n\nThe Tortoise and Serpent Generals received their orders and, together with the Patriarch, soared upon the clouds to a place called Ten Thousand Pines Grove, where they took their positions. The Patriarch transformed into a Daoist priest and began chanting scriptures within the abbey.\n\nZhao Gongming, defeated by the Patriarch, fled to the Clear Wind Cave but found no refuge. Ravenous with hunger, he spotted the abbey ahead, its scripture-chanting resonant. Entering, he was led into the hall by the priest. Overcome by hunger, he demanded, “Bring me food at once!”\n\nThe priest replied, “Where have you come from, honored guest? Our noon meal is finished, and the evening repast is not yet prepared. I can only offer you tea.”\n\n“Then bring me a cup of tea,” Zhao Gongming said, “and quickly prepare food after—I am starving.”\n\nThe Patriarch placed the Tortoise Spirit, transformed into a jujube, into the tea and offered it to Zhao Gongming, who swallowed it whole. As the jujube entered his belly, the Patriarch asked, “Zhao Gongming, do you recognize me?”\n\n“Who are you to know my name? I do not know you,” Zhao Gongming replied.\n\n“If you do not recognize me, then behold my true form.” The Patriarch turned and revealed his original appearance.\n\nAt the sight, Zhao Gongming attempted to flee, but the Patriarch commanded the Tortoise Spirit within him to seize his innards. Zhao Gongming cried out in agony, collapsing to the ground.\n\nThe Patriarch said, “The jujube you just ate was my general, the Tortoise Spirit in disguise. If you surrender to me, I shall give you two elixir pellets to expel him. Refuse, and you shall perish.”\n\nHearing this, Zhao Gongming pleaded for mercy, vowing to submit. The Patriarch handed him two Fire Elixirs to swallow, and the Tortoise Spirit emerged. Zhao Gongming bowed in submission, and the Patriarch rejoiced. Zhao Gongming then summoned his seven generals, who arrived in a subdued black qi, pledging their allegiance.\n\nWhat transpired thereafter shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Three: The Patriarch Faces the Golden Blade’s Peril**\n\nIt is told that the Black Tiger Spirit, a general under Zhao Gongming, seeing his master absent, transformed into a young maiden and descended to the mortal realm, concealing herself deep in the mountains. Often, she lurked by the roadside, feigning sorrowful weeping, devising countless schemes to ensnare and devour travelers. One day, she transformed into a maiden, wailing pitifully in the mud by the roadside, crying for help. When the Patriarch approached, she called out, “Save me! Save me!”\n\nThe Patriarch, accompanied by Zhao Gongming and the Water and Fire Generals, arrived to find the maiden mired in the mud, pleading for rescue. Sensing she was a demon, the Patriarch seized her with his right hand. Startled, the demoness fled in terror.\n\nThe Patriarch pursued closely, brandishing his Seven-Star Sword to point at the demon, which then revealed its true form—a great tiger with black stripes. Upon seeing it, Gongming rushed forward and struck with his whip. Recognizing its master’s arrival, the tiger knelt to the ground and begged for mercy. Gongming led the tiger before the Patriarch, who rejoiced greatly.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jade Emperor ascended his throne as the Wondrous Music Heavenly Worthy presented his report, saying that the Patriarch had descended to the mortal realm and subdued Zhao the Killing Spirit and the Black Tiger. Delighted, the Jade Emperor commanded the Heavenly Worthy to descend with the imperial decree, bestowing upon Gongming the titles of Eminent Scholar of the Zhao Mansion, Grand Marshal of the Golden Wheel and Ruyi Enforcer, with a tiger-subduing rope in his left hand and an evil-averting whip in his right. Gongming expressed his gratitude.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy returned to the celestial courts, while the Patriarch, accompanied by Gongming and the Water and Fire Generals, set out once more to subdue the Black Qi. Now, this Black Qi was a sand-blade spirit born from Guan Yu’s saber, known as General Jinlie. It commanded three thousand blade soldiers, all capable of assuming human form, and dwelled in Mount Tiantai. Any who passed beneath the mountain were seized, hacked to mincemeat, and devoured.\n\nOne day, as the Patriarch patrolled the Black Qi and arrived at Mount Tiantai, the blade spirit transformed into a man—tall of body but short of leg, his entire form radiating golden light. Seeing the golden glow enveloping him, the Patriarch knew it was a demon. Drawing the Three Terraces Seven Furrows Sword from his waist, he struck. The blade spirit met the attack, and they fought over a hundred rounds without victory. The blade spirit displayed its divine power, and in an instant, flying blades filled the battlefield, gradually closing in. The Patriarch could not withstand the assault; flying blades pierced his body, and he fell dead upon the field.\n\nSeeing the Patriarch slain, the sand-blade spirit withdrew its troops and returned to Mount Tiantai.\n\nThe Water and Fire Generals and Zhao Gongming, witnessing the Patriarch’s death by blade, were filled with sorrow. The Water General said, “Brothers, our presence here is futile while we stand by helplessly. In my humble opinion, Brother Zhao should guard the Patriarch’s remains while my serpent brother and I ascend to the heavens to seek the Three Pure Ones and inquire how to revive him.”\n\nGongming replied, “Your plan is sound. I shall remain here while you two hasten to the heavens.” The Water and Fire Generals bid farewell to Gongming, mounted the clouds, and ascended directly to the Three Pure Ones’ abode. Prostrating before them, the Three Pure Ones inquired, “You two followed your master to the mortal realm to subdue the Black Qi. Why have you come here?”\n\nThe Tortoise and Serpent Spirits recounted the encounter with the blade spirit and its flying blades. Upon hearing this, the Three Pure Lords immediately issued a decree summoning the Wondrous Music Heavenly Worthy to their presence. After the Heavenly Worthy paid his respects, the Most High Lord Lao said, “Your disciple Xuanyuan descended to the mortal realm and encountered the sand-blade spirit, who slew him with flying blades. The Water and Fire Generals have come seeking aid. You must descend swiftly to revive your disciple and subdue the sand-blade spirit. If you delay beyond ten days, his body will dissolve into blood and water, never to be restored.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy assented and, accompanied by the Water and Fire Generals, took leave of the Three Pure Ones. Returning to his hall, he descended to the mortal realm and arrived at the Patriarch’s remains. Chanting true incantations, he gathered his inner spiritual qi and breathed it into the Patriarch’s mouth three times. Gradually, the Patriarch revived. Seeing his master, he turned and prostrated himself, thanking him for saving his life, and inquired about the blade spirit.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied, “This is no ordinary demon but a rogue magical treasure belonging to a disciple of the Venerable Master Pu’an.” The Patriarch asked, “Who is the Venerable Master Pu’an’s disciple?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy answered, “A man from the Three Kingdoms era, named Guan Yu, styled Yunchang.” The Patriarch said, “I have heard that Guan Yunchang was merely a loyal and valiant warrior of the Three Kingdoms. How did he come to be deified and enter the celestial courts?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied, “You are unaware. In the mortal realm, all loyal ministers, filial sons, and those of upright and selfless conduct are recorded in the earthly registers. When their allotted years end, they ascend to the heavens, where their merits are weighed and ranks bestowed, allowing them to enjoy the rewards of celestial emolument. Such cases are not rare.\n\nIn life, Guan Yu was a man of the Three Kingdoms, unwavering in loyalty and righteousness. Betrayed by Lü Meng’s treachery, he died without yielding, his spirit dispersing in the howling yin winds before coalescing in the clouds. One night, he encountered the Venerable Master Pu’an in meditation. At the utterance of a divine word, Guan Yu descended before the altar. The Dharma Master Pu’an then received him as a disciple and administered the precepts.\n\nOne day, as Pu’an attained the Dao, he ascended to the celestial courts. The Jade Emperor enfeoffed Guan Yu as the Loyal and Righteous Great General, tasked with guarding the Heavenly Gates by day and overseeing Fengdu by night. Later, when the Tathāgata expounded the Dharma in the Western Heaven, Guan Yu learned of the sufferings of samsara. Pleading illness to his lord, he secretly accompanied Zhou Cang and Guan Ping to the Western Heaven to hear the teachings, leaving his sand-blade behind at home.\n\nUnexpectedly, this unruly creature, seeing its master absent, descended to the mortal realm to wreak havoc. If you wish to subdue the sand-blade spirit, you must journey to the Western Heaven and summon Guan Yu himself, for only then can this object be reclaimed.”\n\nOverjoyed, the Patriarch bid farewell to his master and instructed Zhao Gongming and the Water and Fire Generals to remain on guard. Then, mounting a propitious cloud, he set forth toward the West to seek the Tathāgata. As the Tathāgata expounded the sutras and preached the Dharma in the Thunderclap Monastery, he saw a propitious cloud approaching. Turning to Guan Yu, he said, “The Supreme Emperor faces peril and has come to seek you.”\n\n“For what purpose have I been summoned?” asked Guan Yu.\n\n“You shall know shortly,” replied the Tathāgata.\n\nBefore the words had faded, the Supreme Emperor entered from without and prostrated himself before the dais. The Tathāgata descended the steps to raise him, saying, “I already knew of Your Majesty’s arrival. Pray, take a seat. I have summoned Guan Yu here so that you may explain the matter in detail.”\n\n“Very well,” said the Supreme Emperor.\n\nThe Tathāgata then called Guan Yu to appear before the Supreme Emperor. After the formalities of greeting were complete, the Patriarch recounted the affair of the sand-blade. Guan Yu replied, “If my blade has caused mischief, and Your Majesty has deigned to summon me, how could I dare refuse? Yet my heart is set on the Buddha-Dharma, and though I have heard the sutras, I have not yet attained awakening. How can I depart? Allow me to reach enlightenment first, and then I shall go.”\n\nThe Tathāgata said, “There is something you do not understand. The Supreme Emperor is a transformation of one of the Jade Emperor’s souls. Once, due to unchecked desire, he fell into the mortal realm, but now he has restored his golden body. You are his subject, and he is your lord. If the lord commands his minister to die, the minister cannot refuse; if a father orders his son to perish, the son cannot disobey. Now that he has come, how can there be any reason for you not to go?”\n\nGuan Yu said, “If I must go, then I shall go, but I have not yet completed my study of the Dharma—how can we meet again?”\n\nThe Tathāgata replied, “Though your study is not yet complete, if you remain here and take the Supreme Emperor as your master, you shall be spared from the toils of the mortal realm for life after life. You need not listen to sutras or receive teachings to escape the suffering of samsara.”\n\nGuan Yu, overjoyed at these words, thanked the Tathāgata. He instructed Guan Ping and Zhou Cang to return home, then turned and bowed to the Patriarch. The Patriarch was greatly pleased. Taking leave of the Tathāgata, he departed the Western Heaven with Guan Yu, descending upon clouds to meet the Water and Fire generals and Lord Gongming. All rejoiced.\n\nAt dawn the next day, Guan Yu raised a clamor before the Heavenly Terrace Mountain. The blade spirit, drinking wine in his cave, heard the uproar outside and grew furious. Donning his armor, he strode from the cave entrance. There stood Guan Yu, nine feet and three inches tall, his face like dark jujubes, clad in a green robe, seated upon his red hare steed, exuding a murderous aura. The blade spirit looked up, saw his former master, and his bones turned to jelly. Revealing his true form, he collapsed to the ground. Guan Yu stepped forward, seized him, and brought him before the Patriarch. The Patriarch was overjoyed and memorialized the Jade Emperor. An edict arrived from the Jade Emperor, appointing Guan Yu as **Lord Chongning, Daoist Perfected Sovereign of Resplendent Numinosity, Marshal of the Pass of Primordial Qi**, resuming his former duties: guarding the Heavenly Gate by day and overseeing Fengdu Hell by night, patrolling and inspecting all realms. In his left hand he held the **Golden Fierce Sand Blade**, in his right the **Purple Tenuity Edict Seal**; his left foot rested upon a **Thunder Spirit**, his right upon a **Fire Chariot**, aiding the Supreme Emperor in subduing demons. Guan Yu expressed his gratitude. What befell thereafter shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\n**The Patriarch Subdues the Thunder and Field Generals**\n\nThe Patriarch, having captured the sand blade spirit, continued onward with the Water, Fire, and other generals until they reached the region of Yongzhou. Suddenly, a flickering demonic aura and a sky-piercing grievance met their gaze. The Patriarch looked up to see an old man weeping bitterly as he approached. The Patriarch stepped forward and asked, “Elder, why do you weep so sorrowfully?”\n\nThe old man replied, “This is the land of Yongzhou. My name is Sun Hao, and my entire household of seven has observed the fast on the third day of the third month.”\n\nThe Patriarch asked, “Why observe the fast on the third day of the third month?”\n\nThe old man said, “I have heard that a man who cultivated the Dao on Mount Wudang has now ascended to Heaven. We seek his blessings, so we fast on his birthday.”\n\nThe Patriarch said, “Since you fast on his birthday, you are a virtuous man—no harm should befall you. Why then do you weep so bitterly today?”\n\nThe old man replied, “My weeping is not for the fast. Not far from here lies a mountain called Divine Thunder Mountain. Recently, a demon has appeared there, wearing a Daoist crown, his ghostly head bearing three eyes, wielding a hammer, and styling himself the **Newly Ascendant King**. This demon is lustful beyond measure. Whenever a local family has a maiden to be wed, they must send her to his mountain to spend the night before the wedding day—only then will she be allowed to proceed with the marriage. If they refuse, the demon emerges from the mountain and slays the entire family of the bride-to-be. I have a granddaughter named Jinlian, who is to be wed tomorrow. We had planned to send her, but she refuses to go. If she does not, my entire family will perish—hence my sorrow.”\n\nThe Patriarch said, “I possess the arts to vanquish demons. Do not weep—I shall save you.” The old man bowed in gratitude. The Patriarch instructed him to return home, maintain the fast with devotion, and prepare his granddaughter for the wedding, assuring him there was no need for concern. The old man thanked him and departed.\n\nThe Patriarch summoned Marshal Guan and ordered him to transform into a woman. The Patriarch himself took the form of an old man, and together they approached the cave entrance of Thunder God Mountain. The Newly Ascendant King, seeing the old man delivering a maiden, rejoiced and prepared to emerge from the cave to embrace her. The Patriarch let out a thunderous shout, and Marshal Guan reverted to his true form, charging into the cave. The demon, caught off guard, was seized and brought before the Patriarch. The Patriarch fed him a **Fire Elixir** and enlisted him as a general under his command.\n\nProceeding another thirty *li* or so, they came to a mountain called Fallen Spirit Mountain. Within it lay a cave named **Three Realizations Cave**, home to a chieftain named Tian Hua. He regularly sent lesser demons to patrol the mountain, demanding gold and silver as toll from travelers. Those who could not pay were struck dead by thunder, their bodies blown into the cave by a great wind, their hearts and livers plucked out to steep in wine. One day, as the lesser demons blocked the path ahead, the Patriarch and his company arrived. The demons demanded gold and silver as toll. Sensing the demonic aura clouding the sky, the Patriarch knew these were no ordinary bandits. Drawing his **Three Terraces Seven Stars Sword**, he struck, and the lesser demons fled. The Patriarch pursued them to the cave entrance. The demons rushed inside and reported to their lord, Tian Hua. Enraged, Tian Hua performed a spell within the cave, summoning divine thunder that flew toward the entrance. The Patriarch, seeing this, pointed his Seven Stars Sword and cried, “Halt!” The thunder stood still.\n\nSeeing the thunder stand still, Tian Hua emerged from the cave without a word, spear in hand, and lunged at the Patriarch. Unable to withstand the Patriarch’s might, Tian Hua turned to flee back into the cave, only to be ensnared by Marshal Zhao’s flaming lasso and brought before the Patriarch. Tian Hua pleaded for mercy and pledged allegiance. The Patriarch rejoiced, offering Tian Hua a pellet of Fire Elixir to consume, and took him into his ranks. With two generals now under his command, the Patriarch drafted a memorial to the Jade Emperor. Delighted, the Jade Emperor bestowed upon Xin Xing and Tian Hua the titles of Marshal Lei Kai and Marshal Gou Bi, each wielding a command tally to accompany the Patriarch in subduing demons. Xin Xing and Tian Hua expressed their gratitude.\n\nThe Patriarch and his company continued their journey. Seventy *li* later, they encountered an old man named Zhang Wan. Seeing the Patriarch and his followers dressed as Daoists, the old man stepped forward, bowed, and inquired, “Venerable masters, where are you bound?” The Patriarch replied, “We are traveling to subdue evil.” The old man said, “If you truly possess such powers, there is a mountain near my humble abode called Tou Ge Shan. Within it dwells a demon that reveals no form but, upon spying fine goods or fair maidens, whisks them into its cave with a gust of wind. If your arts are as potent as you claim, I beg you to vanquish this fiend and rid the people of this scourge.”\n\nThe Patriarch took his leave of the old man and led his company to Dou Ge Shan, where they raised a clamor of battle cries. From the cave emerged a figure with crimson hair and tusks, wielding a wind-wheel in one hand and a great blade in the other. He charged at the Patriarch, who met him with his sword. After twenty rounds, Guang Ze, unable to overcome the Patriarch, recited a true incantation. A furious gale erupted from the wind-wheel, scattering the Patriarch’s company and hurling the Patriarch himself beyond the Thirty-Second Heaven. Startled, the Patriarch found himself before a grand hall, its plaque inscribed with the words “Hall of No-Birth.” Entering, he saw a man clad in Daoist robes and cap. The Patriarch stepped forward, bowed, and asked his name. The Daoist replied, “I am Qi Zhao, known as the Water Terrace Immortal.” The Patriarch recounted how he had been blown away while subduing the demon. The Immortal smiled faintly and said, “You are an emanation of the Golden Palace—how have you not mastered this art?” The Patriarch replied, “This humble one is truly ignorant of it.” The Immortal said, “This wind is the pure *qi* of the North Wind, harnessed by this demon to harm others. If dispersed, it would bring coolness to all under heaven. I possess a pellet, forged from the wind and fire of a thousand kalpas. Take it, and when you face battle, the wind will not move you.”\n\nThe Patriarch received the elixir, bowed in thanks, and departed the hall. Riding the clouds, he returned to Dou Ge Shan, where he reunited with his company and recounted the events. The next morning at dawn, the Patriarch placed the pellet in his mouth and challenged Guang Ze to battle. Guang Ze once more unleashed his wind-wheel, but the Patriarch stood unmoved. Stunned, Guang Ze fumbled in dismay as the company seized him. He kowtowed and pledged allegiance. The Patriarch rejoiced. A decree from the Jade Emperor arrived, appointing Guang Ze as Marshal Zhou of the Wind-Wheel to accompany the Patriarch in his Way. What befell them thereafter? Tune in to the next chapter for the resolution.\n\nThe Patriarch Subdues the Plague and Crosses Flame Mountain\n\nNow, in Ninghai County of Shandong, there emerged a demon unseen in form, who invaded people’s dreams. He called himself Zhang Jian, spreading the plague of pox and rashes to harm the young children of households. Wherever his touch fell, he planted the seeds of pox and rashes, bringing death to families’ sons and daughters.\n\nAs the Patriarch arrived, he saw a baleful cloud descending from the sky. Within it stood a man—fair of brow and bright of eye—wearing the helmet of Erlang, herding three children before him. The Patriarch drew his Three-Terrace Seven-Star Sword and struck at Zhang Jian from midair. Enraged, Zhang Jian unsheathed his blade to meet the blow. After fifty rounds, neither gained the upper hand.\n\nZhang Jian cried, “I have no quarrel with you! You dwell in the upper realm, and I in the middle—why not keep to your place?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied, “You spread plague to harm the people. I have come specifically to subdue you.”\n\nHearing this, Zhang Jian made no reply but renewed the battle. The Patriarch summoned his company, and they surged forward as one. Overwhelmed, Zhang Jian fled into his cave and barred the entrance. The Patriarch devised a plan: he had the Serpent Spirit transform into a child, weeping at the cave’s mouth. The lesser demons seized the child and brought it before Zhang Jian, who, thinking it a captive, opened his mouth to devour it. The Serpent Spirit reverted to its true form, slithering into his belly and writhing within. Zhang Jian writhed in agony, collapsing to the ground.\n\nFrom within his stomach, the Serpent Spirit spoke: “Open the cave door and welcome my master and his company. Refuse, and I will crawl inside you until you die.”\n\nZhang Jian hastily unbarred the entrance, admitting the Patriarch and his followers. He knelt, begging for mercy. The Patriarch was pleased. He gave Zhang Jian an elixir of fire to swallow, then bade the Serpent Spirit emerge. A decree from the Jade Emperor soon arrived, appointing Zhang Jian as Marshal Zhang of Utmost Loyalty, wielding the Plague Mallet to follow the Patriarch in his teachings and save the people. The Patriarch then departed Ninghai County.\n\nA hundred *li* from the county stood Flame Mountain. As dusk fell, the Patriarch and his company sought rest upon its slopes when suddenly a baleful cloud arose, alarming all. From its midst emerged a demon chief wearing a Daoist crown, brandishing a Fire-Wheel Blade. Before him, a lesser demon held a crimson banner inscribed: “Great King Xie Shirong of the Water-Defying Citadel.” They descended from the sky to attack.\n\nGenerals Guan and Zhang advanced to meet them. Shirong spewed true fire—its radiance dazzling, its heat overwhelming—and the two generals were forced to retreat. Seeing his commanders falter, the Patriarch drew his Three-Terrace Seven-Star Sword to join the fray. Shirong exhaled more flames, but the Patriarch intoned a true incantation, summoning the Tortoise General. With his Six-Star Sword, he pointed north, drawing forth the true water of Kan. The deluge surged forward.\n\nShirong, being of fire, saw the true water approach and his flames extinguished. A chill seized his body, and he fled back into his cave, barring the entrance. Seeing Shirong refuse to emerge, the Patriarch devised another plan: he had the Tortoise Spirit transform into a lesser demon and descend from the sky to brawl with the cave’s minions before Zhang Jian’s eyes. The Tortoise Spirit then reverted to its true form, flooding the cave with water. Panicked, Shirong rushed out, only for the Patriarch to point his sword and summon the true fire of Kan—its flames billowing, engulfing the cave. Trapped within, Shirong shivered uncontrollably, while his minions wailed in despair, all drowned in the deluge. Only Shirong, half-dead from the cold, found himself cornered with no escape. Tian Hua stormed into the cave and seized him, bringing him before the Patriarch.\n\nThe Patriarch asked, “Will you surrender?”\n\nShirong, nearly frozen to death, had no choice but to submit. The Patriarch displayed his divine power, extracting three measures of true fire from Kan and condensing them into a pellet, which he gave Shirong to swallow. He then memorialized the Jade Emperor, who, greatly pleased, dispatched a celestial envoy bearing a decree. Shirong was appointed Fire Virtue Lord Xie, wielding a golden whip and Fire-Wheel Blade to follow the Patriarch in his teachings. Shirong expressed his gratitude, and the company departed Flame Mountain.\n\nThe Patriarch left Flame Mountain and arrived at Kunlun Mountain, where six demons—self-styled the Six Poisons of Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon, Year, and Time—lurked within. They often lay in ambush along the roads, poisoning travelers who passed by, none escaping unscathed.\n\nAs the Patriarch neared Kunlun Mountain, he saw the demons gathering and warned his company, “These fiends are no ordinary foes. Their glow betrays poisonous qi—be on your guard.”\n\nBefore he could finish, a violent gust assailed them. The Patriarch raised his Three-Terrace Seven-Star Sword to block it, but the poisonous qi struck him full in the face, knocking him senseless. His followers scattered in terror. Moments later, the qi dissipated, and the company regrouped to search for the Patriarch. They found him collapsed, unconscious. Dismayed, Generals Guan and the others exchanged helpless glances, unable to revive him.\n\nGuan then addressed the company: “Watch over the Patriarch’s body. I will ascend to the upper realm to seek the Three Pure Ones’ counsel.”\n\nThe others assented. Guan immediately mounted the clouds and ascended to the heavens, where he prostrated himself before the Three Pure Ones and recounted how the Patriarch had been felled by poison.\n\nThe Three Pure Ones said, “This is the work of six deputy generals under Zhu Yanfu of Kunlun Mountain, known as the Six Toxin Spirits. They unleashed their poison sack beneath the mountain to wreak havoc. To save your master, you must journey to Kunlun and summon Zhu Yanfu—only then can he be revived.”\n\nGeneral Guan replied, “I fear that if I go, Yanfu will refuse to save my master.”\n\nThe Three Pure Ones said, “If you go alone, he will not comply. That man possesses a treasure called the Poison Sack, most formidable indeed. We shall accompany you. First, we will revive your master, then he may go to meet Yanfu. If he refuses to submit, when your master moves to subdue the Six Toxins, you must use a stratagem to capture him.”\n\nOverjoyed, General Guan ascended with the Three Pure Ones upon the clouds, arriving at Kunlun Mountain. There, they saw the Patriarch enveloped in toxic qi, unconscious and insensible. The Three Pure Ones recited the true incantation and waved a fan, dispersing the poisonous vapors. They sprinkled pure water over the Patriarch’s body, circling him as they did so, and exhaled three breaths upon him. The Patriarch stirred faintly, opening his eyes to see the Three Pure Ones. He immediately prostrated himself in obeisance.\n\nThe Three Pure Ones said, “You were lost to the Six Toxins’ qi. To eradicate this poison, you must ascend Kunlun’s peak and entreat Zhu Yanfu to remove it.”\n\nThe Patriarch asked, “What method shall I use to dispel it?”\n\nThe Three Pure Ones replied, “If you engage him in battle, he will surely open his Poison Sack to ensnare your generals. I possess a treasure fan called the Carefree Fan, which has endured through countless kalpas. No perverse or demonic qi dares approach it—one wave and all is vanquished. Take it and give it to your subordinate, Marshal Xie, who is originally the Star of Fire Virtue. Should you meet in battle and Yanfu opens his sack, have Marshal Xie enter it bearing my fan. Let him burn his way out with fire, and the Poison Sack will be destroyed, unable to capture you. Only then can you subdue this man. If Yanfu surrenders, return the fan to the upper realm without delay.”\n\nThe Patriarch bowed deeply in gratitude. The Three Pure Ones then mounted the clouds and returned to their celestial palace.\n\nThe Patriarch immediately instructed Marshal Xie to follow the plan. At dawn the next day, he ascended with his generals to the summit of Kunlun Mountain and entered to see Zhu Yanfu. Yanfu sat unmoving. The Patriarch stepped forward and bowed, but Yanfu, still seated, haughtily demanded, “Who comes here?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied, “I am Zhenwu, the Perfected Martial General of the North, sent by the Jade Decree to subdue the black qi below.”\n\nYanfu asked, “Why have you come here to subdue black qi?”\n\nThe Patriarch said, “There is a scourge of Six Toxins beneath the mountain. I hear it is caused by your subordinates, who harm the people. I ask you to subdue them.”\n\nYanfu retorted, “You were sent to subdue black qi, yet you oppose my generals. If you cannot subdue them, how dare you come before me?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied, “I was sent to eradicate all demonic black qi, serving the Jade Emperor and relieving the people’s suffering. Now I ask you to act—why do you speak thus?”\n\nYanfu snapped, “Do not speak another word of nonsense.”\n\n\"If you do not leave at once, I possess a dharma-treasure that can contain all of you—after seven days, you will dissolve into pus and water.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Marshal Xie suppressed the fire in his heart and stepped forward to curse Yanfu. Yanfu made no reply; he simply took out the Poison-Containing Bag and cast it upward. All the generals fled. Only Marshal Xie stood firm, holding his fan before the steps, and was enveloped by the bag. The Patriarch and his company turned to do battle with Yanfu. From within the bag, Marshal Xie burned his way out. Seeing the bag torn by fire, Yanfu was greatly alarmed. Marshal Xie fanned him squarely on the head, and Yanfu, unable to escape, collapsed to the ground. The generals seized him, and Yanfu surrendered in submission.\n\nThe Patriarch took a golden elixir to mend the Poison-Containing Bag, then drew forth a Fire Elixir and fed it to Yanfu. A Jade Decree descended, appointing Yanfu as Marshal Zhu, Keeper of Those Who Disbelieve in the Dao and Its Methods. He was given a golden mallet to wield and the Five-Poison Bag to carry, and ordered to follow his master in the Way.\n\nZhu Yanfu expressed his gratitude, then took leave of his master to descend the mountain. He stretched open the Poison-Containing Bag and gathered all Six Toxins into it before returning to the Patriarch. The Patriarch was overjoyed.\n\nYanfu said, \"Now that I have collected all the toxic qi, I fear that in days to come, people may conflate miscellaneous perverse qi with the Six Toxins, falsely invoking my name to gather poisonous qi. I wish to eliminate those who engage in such deception.\"\n\nThe Patriarch replied, \"Very well.\"\n\nWhat transpires thereafter shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\nThe Patriarch was about to set forth with his retinue when suddenly a propitious cloud descended, bearing the Star Lord of the West, Tai Bai. A jade decree arrived, which he proclaimed:\n\n\"Since you entered the Dao, We have been filled with joy. The black qi of the Middle Realm has gradually been severed. Yet We did not expect Hua Guang to remain unchanged in his original heart—striking Our prince and later setting fire to the Southern Heaven’s Precious Virtue Pass, throwing the Celestial Palace into chaos. The ministers have recommended you, for you are the Water of the Northern Ren and Gui, capable of extinguishing the Fire of the Southern Bing and Ding. You are to subdue Hua Guang. Upon receiving this decree, proceed at once without delay!\"\n\nThe Patriarch expressed his gratitude and accepted the decree. He instructed his generals to accompany the Star Lord Tai Bai, and together they rode the clouds straight into the Celestial Pass, where they encountered Hua Guang. The Patriarch drew his Three Terraces Sword and shouted, \"Who comes? Do not be rude!\"\n\nHua Guang replied, \"I am one who delights in this renowned place, fond of wine and women, known as the Flower-and-Wine Marshal Ma Lingguan.\"\n\nThe Patriarch asked, \"Are you not the former Hua Guang?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered.\n\nThe Patriarch said, \"What grievance have you against the Jade Emperor that you dare set fire to the Southern Heaven’s Pass?\"\n\nHua Guang retorted, \"You dwell in the North, and I burn the South—what concern is it of yours?\"\n\nThe Patriarch declared, \"I am here by the Jade Emperor’s decree to capture you. Surrender peacefully, or in an instant, I shall reduce you to nothing.\"\n\nHua Guang, being of a fiery nature, did not reply but instead brandished his long spear and lunged at the Patriarch. The Patriarch displayed his divine power, his head reaching the Thirty-Three Heavens and his feet spanning the Five Lakes and Four Seas. Upon seeing this, Hua Guang transformed into a being with three heads and six arms, engaging the Patriarch in fierce battle. The Patriarch rallied his generals, who charged from all sides. Hua Guang was soundly defeated and fled toward the North.\n\nThe Patriarch pursued him, but Hua Guang, seeing this, hurled his Three-Cornered Golden Brick. The Patriarch used his banner to roll it up and capture it. Frustrated, Hua Guang then unleashed his Wind and Fire Wheels, but the Patriarch seized them with his Seven-Star Sword. Panicked, Hua Guang threw his Fire Pellets, only for them to be similarly ensnared. With no escape, Hua Guang fought desperately. The Patriarch summoned the Water of the Northern Ren and Gui, overwhelming Hua Guang and pinning him to the ground with his Water-Subduing Staff, rendering him immobile.\n\nNow, Hua Guang had originally been a pile of lamp wicks before the Tathāgata, who later recited a true mantra to transform him. He was the essence, spirit, and yin of fire, and thus, upon encountering the Water of the Northern Ren and Gui, he could not escape and was captured by the Celestial Emperor.\n\nThe Patriarch said, \"You beast, ignorant of worldly affairs—what power did you possess to strike the prince? Now that you are captured, what excuse do you have?\"\n\nPressed beneath the water, unable to move his limbs, Hua Guang wept, \"This disciple was driven by Deng Hua’s coercion, forced into this act. Now that I am seized by the Celestial Emperor, I beg for your compassion and mercy.\"\n\nThe Patriarch replied, \"If you are willing to abandon evil and return to the right path, I shall enlist you as a general under my command.\"\n\nHua Guang promptly agreed, \"If the Celestial Emperor is willing to save me, I vow to submit and never rebel again.\"\n\nThe Patriarch then took out a Water-Gathering Pearl, transformed it into a pellet, and instructed Hua Guang to swallow it. \"I shall spare you thus.\"\n\nHua Guang had no choice but to comply. The Patriarch warned, \"That pellet is my Water-Gathering Pearl. If you harbor any rebellious thoughts, I shall recite the incantation, and the water in your belly will boil, reducing you to water within seven days.\"\n\nHua Guang said, \"I am forever indebted to the Celestial Emperor for saving my life and shall remain at your side.\"\n\nThe Celestial Emperor, hearing this, lifted the Water-Subduing Staff and released Hua Guang.\n\nHua Guang then said, \"Though you have taken me in, the Celestial Soldiers press closely to capture me. How may I escape the Celestial Court?\"\n\nThe Patriarch replied, \"You are a fire star—head south.\"\n\nHua Guang said, \"My dharma treasures have all been taken by you. How can I go?\"\n\nThe Patriarch returned his former treasures to him. Hua Guang bid farewell to the Patriarch and descended to the Middle Realm.\n\nThe Patriarch returned to the Jade Emperor and, after the customary prostrations, the Jade Emperor asked, \"We summoned you to capture Hua Guang. Have you done so?\"\n\nThe Patriarch replied, \"Your servant has indeed subdued Hua Guang.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor said, \"Since you have captured him, why not bring him before Us for sentencing?\"\n\nThe Patriarch petitioned, \"This servant observes that Hua Guang did not rebel out of malice but was driven by circumstances. I beg Your Majesty to show mercy and allow Hua Guang to assist in the Middle Realm in subduing the black qi. If he renders merit in the future, let it offset his crimes.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor assented. The Patriarch then requested permission to descend to the mortal realm to subdue the black qi. The Five Emperors, upon hearing this, were greatly pleased. They personally offered three cups of imperial wine and draped him with ceremonial silk before departing the Golden Palace.\n\nExiting the Southern Heaven’s Precious Virtue Pass, the Patriarch descended to the mortal realm with his generals, resuming their journey along the familiar path. They arrived at a place under the jurisdiction of Huaizhou Prefecture.\n\nIn the village, they encountered a man weeping bitterly as he approached. The Patriarch stepped forward and asked, \"Venerable elder, why do you weep so?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"I am Li Zhoufang. In our village, two years ago, a demon appeared, visiting the dreams of the villagers. It claimed its name was Dang Guiji, its body black in hue, and demanded that we build a temple in its honor. It insisted that during the New Year and the Dragon Boat Festival, we offer it the three sacrificial animals along with wine and sweet liquor; if we refused, it would take five lives from our village each day. The villagers did not believe it at first, but true to its word, within three days, fifteen of us perished. In fear, we built a temple and made offerings, and indeed, we enjoyed a year of peace.\n\nThis year, as the Dragon Boat Festival approaches, the demon has again appeared in the villagers’ dreams, declaring that this year it does not want the three sacrificial animals or wine and sweet liquor—it demands that I send my daughter to the temple to serve it for a full year, to be released on the corresponding day next year. If I refuse, it will slaughter everyone in the village. I have only this one daughter, and if I do not send her, it will harm all the villagers. On the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, the people will come to my home to seize her and take her to the temple. I am trapped with no way out, and so I weep in despair.\"\n\nThe Patriarch said, \"Venerable elder, do not weep. My disciples and I possess the arts to subdue this demon.\" Upon hearing this, Li Zhoufang bowed in gratitude.\n\nThe Patriarch said, \"No need for bows. Return home in peace; all will be resolved.\" Zhoufang took his leave and departed.\n\nThe Patriarch then summoned Zhu Yanfu, transforming him into a maiden while he himself took the form of Li Zhoufang. He instructed them to lie in ambush beside the temple and enter it as planned. The lesser demons reported to Dang Guiji, who rejoiced and emerged from his cave, descending the steps to embrace the maiden and carry her inside. The Patriarch then revealed his true form, drawing his Seven-Star Sword, while Marshal Zhu also resumed his original shape. As Dang Guiji attempted to flee, the serpent spirit from the rack leapt down and coiled around him, pinning him to the ground. Dang Guiji cried out in misery.\n\nThe Patriarch asked, \"Will you surrender?\" Guiji repeatedly declared his willingness to yield. The Patriarch took out a Fire Elixir, fed it to Guiji, and set the temple ablaze. He then submitted a memorial to the Jade Emperor, who appointed Dang Guiji as the Examining Marshal of the Dang Regiment, wielding a bamboo staff and following the Patriarch to subdue demons. After Guiji expressed his gratitude, the Patriarch and his company continued on their way.\n\nMeanwhile, the villagers, seeing the flames in the temple extinguished and no further calamities befalling them, all gazed heavenward and bowed in thanks. The Patriarch, perceiving this with his wisdom-eye, turned his cloud around and descended before the people. Li Zhoufang, along with the villagers, bowed and said, \"Had it not been for Your Daoist Truth, our entire village would have perished. May we know your honorable name?\"\n\nThe Patriarch wrote six characters in the air: \"Northern True Martial General.\" Then, ascending halfway into the sky, he let his hair flow loose behind him, his feet treading upon the tortoise and serpent, his hand gripping the Three Terraces Seven-Star Sword. The people looked up and bowed deeply. In an instant, he vanished from sight.\n\nThe villagers erected a temple and enshrined the Patriarch’s statue, offering daily devotion—this need not be recounted further.\n\nNow, in the Black Pine Forest of Xi’an Prefecture, there lived a demon named Kang Xi, who wore an Erlang helmet and bore three strands of whiskers tied with melon vines. He dwelled in Benevolent Sage Crag, stirring up malevolence. The Patriarch and his retinue arrived at Black Pine Forest, where Kang Xi transformed into a bandit blocking the path, demanding gold, treasures, and meat as toll. The Patriarch replied, “We are ascetics—where would we obtain such things?”\n\nKang Xi said, “If you have none, dare you call out to me three times, and I shall let you pass.”\n\nThe Patriarch declared, “If truly we possess no treasures or meat, I dare call ten times.”\n\nNo sooner had the Patriarch spoken than Kang Xi muttered an incantation, summoning a bronze bell from midair to trap him beneath it. Kang Xi then returned to his cave. The generals strove to lift the bell but could not, their hearts heavy with distress. They sent the Serpent Spirit to seek the Venerable Miaole.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy asked the Serpent Spirit, “You follow your master to subdue demons—why have you come here?”\n\nThe Serpent Spirit recounted how their master had been ensnared by the bell. The Heavenly Worthy descended with the Serpent Spirit, intoning a true spell. Drawing a bowl of pure water, he cast it eastward, and an eastern wind blew the bell aside. The Patriarch lay lifeless within. The Heavenly Worthy placed a pellet of Returning-Soul Elixir into his mouth and exhaled upon him thrice. The Patriarch revived, bowing in gratitude.\n\nInquiring about the demon, the Heavenly Worthy replied, “This fiend is on intimate terms with the Smoky Daoist of the rear cave. The Daoist is not presently in his abode, and his whereabouts are unknown. I shall transform into a Daoist priest, and the Serpent Spirit into an immortal elixir. We shall deliver it to the demon—he will surely suspect nothing. Once he consumes the elixir, we shall subdue him.”\n\nThe Patriarch rejoiced and waited with his generals at the foot of Black Pine Forest. The Heavenly Worthy transformed into a Daoist priest, while the Serpent Spirit became an elixir. They approached the cave, and a lesser demon announced their arrival. Kang Xi emerged to greet them.\n\nThe Daoist priest said, “I have long admired Your Excellency’s renown. Hearing of the great king’s recent exertions, my humble cave has refined two immortal elixirs. Unworthy to consume them myself, I humbly present one to augment Your Excellency’s lifespan by a century.”\n\nKang Xi, overjoyed, bowed in thanks and swallowed the elixir. The Heavenly Worthy asked, “Do you recognize me?”\n\nKang Xi replied, “Why speak so madly? We have long been acquainted—how could I not know you?”\n\nThe Venerable Miaole declared, “I am no Daoist priest,” and revealed his true form. Kang Xi, beholding it, was struck with terror.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said, “You have just consumed an elixir—transformed from my Serpent Spirit. For trapping the Patriarch beneath the bell, I have come to seize you.”\n\nKang Xi refused to believe it. The Heavenly Worthy called out to the Serpent Spirit, who responded from within Kang Xi’s belly, slithering upward. Kang Xi clutched his stomach in agony and collapsed. The Heavenly Worthy asked, “Will you submit?”\n\nOvercome by pain, the demon relented. The Heavenly Worthy bade the Patriarch enter the cave, retrieve a Fire Elixir, and feed it to Kang Xi, then summon the Serpent Spirit forth. The Venerable Miaole ascended on clouds to memorialize the Jade Emperor, who bestowed upon Kang Xi the title Benevolent Sage Marshal Kang, wielding a golden axe to aid the Patriarch in subduing demons—this shall be recounted later.\n\nHow the tale unfolds next shall be revealed in the following chapter. The Patriarch received a transformation from the Purple Tenuity.\n\nNow, in a village of Guizhou Prefecture stood a bridge called the Spirit-Passing Bridge. Beneath it lay tens of thousands of ghostly soldiers who emerged at dead of night, vanishing by dawn with mournful cries. Their leader was one Pang Qiao, who wore a golden circlet upon his head. From dusk till midnight, none dared cross the bridge or sail beneath it, for any boatman who passed would be dragged into the water and devoured, his corpse never to be seen. The villagers shunned the bridge, and ferrymen refused to ply their craft.\n\nThe Patriarch arrived with his generals at the bridge’s edge as dusk fell. They rested beneath its span, and at the first watch, a chill wind howled as ghostly wails rose in the dark. The Patriarch warned, “Disciples, another demon lurks here—remain vigilant.” Before he could finish, the ghostly horde swarmed the bridge, seizing the men. The Patriarch and his followers drew their blades and struck, driving the ghosts back into the water. Tortoise and Serpent Generals, wielding the Golden Fiery Sand Blade, charged after them. The ghosts fled to report to Pang Qiao, who burst from his lair to engage the two generals. Outmatched, Tortoise and Serpent retreated to the shore, only for Pang Qiao to pursue—until he met Marshal Zhu, who clashed with him in fierce combat. The Marshal cast his Five-Poison Bag, ensnaring Pang Qiao within. Bound and brought before the Patriarch, Pang Qiao kowtowed in submission. The Patriarch fed him a Human Elixir, then memorialized the Jade Emperor. By imperial decree, Pang Qiao was named Marshal of Primal Qi, armed with a golden blade to aid the Patriarch in subduing demons.\n\nThe tale now turns elsewhere. In the heavens, the Purple Tenuity Star faced calamity, falling to the mortal realm and taking birth in the household of Elder Gao of the Western Forests. Unnoticed, time flew like an arrow, days and months like a shuttle, until fifteen years had passed. The Purple Tenuity grew into a man of striking presence, named Gao Yuan, his bearing noble and his features refined. Meanwhile, Emperor Yang of the Sui, heir to the throne, held court with his ministers. Lu Pingshu stepped forth and petitioned, “Your Majesty has no heir, only a daughter, Princess Yusheng, now come of age. You might select a consort for her as a joyous occasion—perhaps an heir may yet come.” The Emperor approved, decreeing the erection of a bridal pavilion. Gao Yuan, still unwed, heard of the imperial selection and wandered beneath the pavilion. The Princess, struck by his elegant bearing, cast down her jade silk whip, summoning him into the palace. Delighted, the Emperor named Gao Yuan her consort and held a grand feast for his ministers.\n\nThe next day, Emperor Yang ascended the throne. A messenger presented an urgent memorial: the northern barbarian king had rebelled, his armies assaulting the frontier. Enraged, the Emperor demanded counsel. Lu Pingshu advised, “Your Majesty’s newly chosen consort could lead the troops, with Yang Qinhu, son of Yang Li—peerless in valor—as vanguard. Only thus may the barbarians be repelled.” The Emperor agreed, dispatching Yang Qinhu and the consort to the front. There, the consort clashed with the barbarian general Nada’er, who proved no match for Yang Qinhu and fled in defeat. The consort pressed the attack, slaughtering countless foes until the barbarian king retreated north. Returning in triumph, the consort was received with joy, though the Emperor’s nights remained troubled by the lack of an heir. He commissioned endless rituals, yet never once ascended the altar himself, instead reveling in the palace and bleeding the realm dry.\n\nOn the seventh day of the seventh month, a star plunged into the consort’s estate, its radiance dazzling—none other than the Purple Tenuity Star. That night, the consort dreamed of ascending the Golden Palace before awakening, the star’s descent now explained. The Emperor, drinking in the palace, witnessed the spectacle and demanded, “What fell, and where?” His ministers reported it had landed in the consort’s residence. Enraged, the Emperor summoned the consort the next day. After the customary obeisance, he declared, “I chose you as consort, yet after three years, you have given me nothing. Last night, a luminous object fell into your home—clearly a demonic omen.” He ordered the consort’s execution. Terrified, Gao Yuan kowtowed and pleaded, “I am a man of the west, son of Gao Lin—how could I be a demon? Spare me, and if I bear no son within a year, I will accept my fate. I am no demon.” The Emperor’s wrath cooled, and he relented.\n\nThe consort returned home and recounted the ordeal to the Princess. Horrified, she burned incense nightly in the rear garden, praying for an heir. One day, as she dozed in the garden, the Star of Venus appeared in her dream, saying, “Your father is without the Way and deserves no heir. Your husband is a celestial star, cast down for offending the Jade Emperor—thus, you too shall have no child.” With that, the vision vanished. The Princess awoke and told the consort of the dream. Overcome, he wept, then bade her farewell and hanged himself in the rear hall. The Princess, finding him, wailed in grief and petitioned the Emperor for a proper burial, which was granted.\n\nAs for the consort, his soul drifted aimlessly until the local earth god, recognizing the fallen Purple Tenuity, prepared to escort him to the Lord of the Underworld.\n\nJust as the earth god was about to lead him away, the Patriarch happened upon them, searching for dark qi alongside his retinue. The earth god came forth to greet them and reported the matter of the consort. The Patriarch ordered the earth god to bring the soul before him. The consort recounted all that had transpired. The Patriarch then drafted a memorial to the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor pardoned the Purple Tenuity’s former offenses and enfeoffed him as the Fierce-Nature Marshal Gao Yuan, Descended from the Nine Heavens, wielding a bronze sword in his left hand and a golden basin in his right, within which rested a coiled topknot of purple-gold. He was to follow the Patriarch in subduing demons. Marshal Gao expressed his gratitude and withdrew.\n\nAs for what transpired later, that shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\nThe Patriarch Acquires the Five Thunders and Five Tones\nNow, in the western lands there stood a mountain called Mount Chasi. Within it, the people had built a temple, and in that temple stood five divine statues, each with a name: Zhou Chang, Zhao Guang, Shi Ding, Liu Ze, and Pei Jian. As the Patriarch and his retinue pursued the dark qi, they suddenly encountered a great rain. Seeking shelter, they entered the temple. Just as they were about to sit, they saw malevolent qi surging. The Patriarch was startled; looking up, he saw the five statues come to life and begin brawling among themselves. As the Patriarch and his company attempted to flee the temple, the sky darkened in an instant, clouds and mist swirling, and thunder roared, shaking heaven and earth. The Patriarch found himself unable to move, his head pounding, his vision blurring, and he collapsed to the ground in a stupor. Marshal Guan, alarmed, rushed forward and carried the Patriarch out of the temple, but he remained insensible. The retinue, distressed, resolved to send Marshal Gao to ride the clouds and summon the Venerable Miaole to revive the Patriarch.\n\nNow, the Venerable Miaole was seated in the Hall of Longevity when Marshal Gao arrived. “You follow your master in subduing demons,” he said. “Why have you come here?” Marshal Gao recounted how they had entered the temple and been struck by thunder, leaving the Patriarch unconscious. The Venerable said, “The five within the temple are the Five Thunder Gods. Only when they fight among themselves does thunder sound. Since your master has been harmed and lies insensible, you must hasten to the Eastern Heaven and summon the master of the Five Thunders to subdue this menace.” Marshal Gao asked, “Who is their master?” The Venerable replied, “The Thunder Lord is surnamed Deng, named Cheng, and styled Heavenly Lord. He resides in the Taihua Palace. Go swiftly.”\n\nMarshal Gao took his leave of the Venerable and journeyed directly to the Taihua Palace, where he paid his respects to the Heavenly Lord Deng. The Heavenly Lord said, “I hear you accompany the Northern General in pursuing dark qi. Why have you come here?” Marshal Gao replied, “I follow my master in subduing demons. We arrived at a place where, within a temple, five deities suddenly began fighting among themselves. Thunder resounded, and my master fled the temple but fell insensible. I inquired of the Venerable, who said they are your subordinates. I beg you to issue your command to subdue the Five Thunder Gods and revive my master.” The Heavenly Lord, having heard this, descended to the mortal realm with Marshal Gao. After the retinue exchanged greetings, the Heavenly Lord performed his arts: he filled his mouth with water and sprayed it upon the Patriarch’s face, whereupon the Patriarch awoke and bowed in thanks. The Heavenly Lord strode to the temple gates, let out a great shout, and brandished his command tablet. The Five Thunder Gods knelt before him. With a gesture toward the southern direction, he summoned forth five Thunder Lords—sharp-beaked, chicken-winged, wielding pointed hammers—who advanced. The five deities revealed their true forms, which were but five drums, now restrained by the Thunder Gods. The Heavenly Lord said, “I shall not keep these Five Thunders. Let them follow you to subdue demons.” The Patriarch rejoiced. The Heavenly Lord then returned to the Taihua Palace, while the Patriarch, now accompanied by the Five Thunders, journeyed onward.\n\nThey arrived at a place where a mountain called White Rock Mountain stood. Within it lay a cave named White Stone Cave.\n\nWithin the cave dwelled a demon, originally a brush once used by the Perfected Jiang that had attained spirit. It took the surname Tian and the given name Guai. Under its command were twelve lesser generals: the first named Mountain Demon, the second Water Monster, the third Stone Demon, the fourth Cliff Demon, the fifth Metal Demon, the sixth Wood Demon, the seventh Earth Demon, the eighth Fire Demon, the ninth Mud Demon, the tenth Sand Demon, the eleventh Human Demon, and the twelfth Star Demon. It possessed a dharma-treasure—a paper ledger of some thirty-odd pages—imbued with great numinous power. Whenever it encountered humans, it would unfurl the ledger, and the people would enter of their own accord, only to be carried into the cave and devoured. One day, Tian Guai emerged from the cave and chanced upon the Patriarch. Unprepared, the master and disciples were caught off guard when two of the demon’s underlings unfurled the ledger, trapping the entire company within. They were borne back to the cave, where Tian Guai rejoiced and ordered his minions to prepare a feast, intending to bring out the Patriarch and his followers to be cooked.\n\nHearing this, the captives were alarmed. Marshal Ma said, “Fear not. This ledger is made of paper, and I carry fire pellets. Ready your weapons and wait.” With that, Marshal Ma produced a fire pellet, while Marshal Zhou activated his wind wheel. The fire drew strength from the wind, and the wind fed the flames, setting the ledger ablaze. As it burned through, the company burst out, weapons in hand, and gave chase. Tian Guai fled with the ledger. Before the Patriarch, Marshal Deng, and Marshal Gao could emerge, they were swept away with the ledger by Tian Guai. The remaining marshals, unable to find the three, were deeply distressed. They conferred and decided to seek the Three Pure Ones, prostrating themselves to recount the events.\n\nThe Three Pure Ones listened and summoned the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Music to the hall. They said, “Your disciples now face peril, trapped within the ledger by Tian Guai and unable to escape. Their companions have come to seek aid. You must rescue them.” The Heavenly Worthy replied, “To free the three from the ledger, this object is the dharma-treasure of the Perfected Jiang. Only by requesting the Perfected Jiang’s presence can they be saved.” The Three Pure Ones said, “Then go swiftly with the marshals.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy took leave of the Three Pure Ones and ascended to the summit of White Rock Mountain. Entering the hermitage, he met the Perfected Jiang, who came forth to receive him with reverence. After the bows were exchanged, the Heavenly Worthy asked, “Is your dharma-treasure still in your possession?” The Perfected Jiang replied, “My dharma-treasure was entrusted to Tian Guai for safekeeping in the cave.” The Heavenly Worthy said, “If it remains there, bring it forth for me to see.” The Perfected Jiang entered the cave to search but found nothing. Greatly alarmed, he emerged to inform the Heavenly Worthy. The Heavenly Worthy smiled and said, “You tempered yourself through five hundred kalpas to obtain this treasure, yet you did not guard it with care. I have come precisely for this treasure of yours.” The Perfected Jiang said, “Since you have come for my treasure, you must know its whereabouts. I beg you to guide me in finding it.” The Heavenly Worthy replied, “The True Martial General of the North descended to the mortal realm by jade decree to subdue the black qi. Arriving at White Rock Mountain, he encountered Tian Guai, who opened your treasure and seized my disciples into the ledger. You remain unaware. Hasten now to rescue my disciples and retrieve the dharma-treasure, lest you violate the heavenly statutes.”\n\nHearing this, the Perfected Jiang was greatly shocked. He accompanied the Heavenly Worthy to the cave’s entrance and summoned Tian Guai. Upon learning of his master’s arrival, Tian Guai emerged with twelve demonic generals to greet the Perfected Jiang. At the sight of Tian Guai and his followers, the Perfected Jiang instantly revealed his true form—three-eyed, blue-faced, and fanged. With a single roar, the twelve demons reverted to their original shapes, and Tian Guai transformed back into his true form: a great brush, wailing in despair upon the ground. The Perfected Jiang cursed Tian Guai, then pointed at the paper ledger with his hand, extracting the Patriarch and the other two. Seizing Tian Guai, the Perfected Jiang reclaimed the dharma-ledger and commanded Tian Guai to submit to the Patriarch. Taking leave of the Heavenly Worthy, he returned to his cave. The Heavenly Worthy instructed Tian Guai to follow the Patriarch and perform the dharma, then parted ways to return to the Great Court. The Patriarch bestowed a pellet of Fire Elixir upon Tian Guai, who consumed it and continued along the path. What transpired thereafter shall be revealed in the following chapter.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Four: The Patriarch Subdues the Sky-Obscuring Canopy**\n\nThe Patriarch bid farewell to the Perfected Jiang and the Heavenly Worthy, then journeyed with his marshals for a day until they reached a place called Purple Radiance Mountain. Within the mountain lay a cave named Yellow Sand Hollow, where a demon named Yu Tian resided. His form was that of a dragon’s body with a ghostly head, and he possessed a dharma-treasure called the Sky-Obscuring Canopy. With five thousand demonic soldiers, he frequently wreaked havoc before Purple Radiance Mountain, tormenting living beings. As the Patriarch and his company arrived at the mountain’s base, they saw a streak of demonic clouds approach. From within emerged a figure—ghost-headed and dragon-bodied—who brandished the Sky-Obscuring Canopy, casting it into the air. Instantly, all before them vanished from sight. The Patriarch and his followers were struck with alarm. In an instant, the canopy enveloped them, plunging them into the earth, leaving them unable to escape. Only Marshal Deng and Marshal Xin, who lagged behind, evaded capture. They fled upon the clouds to the Palace of Great Florescence, where they found the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Music and recounted the events.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said, “This is no ordinary treasure’s mischief—it is the work of the Sky-Obscuring Canopy of Marshal Zhang An of the Southern Heaven. You two need not despair. I shall accompany you to see Marshal Zhang and ask him to rescue your master.” With that, the three set off to the palace of Marshal Zhang. Finding him seated in meditation, the marshal rose to receive them and inquired as to their purpose. The Heavenly Worthy recounted the events in full. Marshal Zhang replied, “This is my fault. Heavenly Worthy, you need not descend to the mortal realm—I shall go with these two.” The Heavenly Worthy, greatly pleased, took leave of Marshal Zhang. The marshal then accompanied the two marshals upon the clouds, gazing down to see a lingering yellow cloud—none other than the Sky-Obscuring Canopy ensnaring the company. Marshal Zhang ordered Deng and Xin to descend and engage Yu Tian in battle. The two marshals obeyed, wielding their weapons as they advanced.\n\nAt the sight of them, Yu Tian rallied his lesser demons to fight. They clashed for three hundred rounds without victory or defeat. From the clouds, Marshal Zhang observed the battle, then raised his sword and exhaled a breath of water, revealing his true form—a Thunder Command Tablet. Grasping the tablet, he performed the dharma, reciting the true incantation and beckoning with his hand. The Sky-Obscuring Canopy stirred, revealing its true form: a yellow banner. Marshal Zhang seized it and tore it open, freeing the Patriarch and his disciples. Emerging from the canopy, the Patriarch questioned Marshal Zhang, and Marshals Deng and Xin recounted the events. Overjoyed, the Patriarch watched as Marshal Zhang released his grip, commanding Yu Tian to submit to the Patriarch.\n\nMarshal Zhang returned to the heavenly court and memorialized the Jade Emperor. A decree arrived, appointing the Three Marshals as the Thunder Gate, with Deng, Xin, and Zhang as the Thunder Marshals. They were assigned to the Judgment Office of Xinjiang County, where Zhang An oversaw the Thunder Gate. The Patriarch rejoiced and bestowed Fire Elixir upon them. Another jade decree arrived, appointing Yu Tian as the Marshal for Subduing Demonic and Heretical Rain, wielding the Thunder Command Yellow Banner to remain ever at the Patriarch’s side, following his teachings. The Patriarch likewise bestowed Fire Elixir upon him, and the company continued on their journey.\n\nThey traveled until they reached a place called Black Tiger Mountain. Within the mountain dwelled two great spirits: one named Ren Wubie, the other Ning Shikua. They wielded a Moon Axe, wreaking havoc upon the mortal realm, seizing people into their cave to make meat buns for consumption.\n\nOne day, the Patriarch arrived at Black Tiger Mountain with his company. Upon seeing them, the two demons seized their axes and hurled them forth, transforming endlessly as they slashed. Marshal Ma, alarmed at the sight of the axes, immediately cast forth Fire Elixir, smelting the jade axes to fall to the ground. He then inverted his golden bell to cover them, capturing the two demons, and brought them before the Patriarch. The demons kowtowed, swearing allegiance. The Patriarch bestowed Fire Elixir upon them to consume. What transpired thereafter shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\nThe Jade Emperor Dispatches an Envoy to Destroy a Village\nThe Patriarch, having gained Ren and Ning as his generals, rejoiced greatly. After traveling with his company for several days, they arrived at a place called Celestial Fire Mountain. Within the mountain dwelled a demon named Liu Hou, who wielded a flying whip and rode a fire chariot. Each year, the villagers below offered a boy and girl as sacrifices; if they failed to do so, Liu Hou would set fire to their homes. That year, the village head, Li Shan, had purchased a boy and girl from a poor family and was about to present them at the cave to sacrifice to Liu Hou. The children, ignorant of the ways of the world, wept bitterly at the temple gate, for their parents, having no money, had no choice but to sell them. As they wailed, the Patriarch and his company arrived before the temple. Inquiring into the matter, the children tearfully recounted their plight. The Patriarch was shocked. Marshal Ma, enraged upon hearing their tale, freed the children, seized his golden spear, and charged into the temple. There, he encountered Liu Hou, who came forth wielding his flying whip. The two clashed fiercely. Marshal Ma hurled his golden brick, striking Liu Hou to the ground, and brought him before the Patriarch. The Patriarch rejoiced. Liu Hou kowtowed, swearing allegiance, and the Patriarch took him in, bestowing Fire Elixir upon him to consume. A memorial was then sent to the Five Emperors, who appointed Liu Hou as Heavenly Lord of the Royal Court, wielding his flying whip and riding his fire chariot, to follow the Patriarch in the Dao.\n\nOne day, the Jade Emperor ascended his throne. The Hearth God of Ban Bamboo Village stepped forth and memorialized: “In Ban Bamboo Village, there are three hundred hearths, and the people all commit evil, living wickedly and acting abominably, showing no reverence for Heaven and Earth.” Enraged upon hearing this, the Jade Emperor decreed: “Approved. Summon Envoy of Pestilence, Zhong Shigui, to descend to the mortal realm and carry out the decree, exterminating the entire village of Ban Bamboo.” Shigui received the decree and departed the celestial court for the mortal realm, where the Earth God received him. The Pestilence God said: “The Five Emperors, upon hearing the memorial, were enraged. They declared that this village, which does not believe in goodness, must be destroyed. I have been sent to descend and carry out the decree. Tomorrow at the hour of *si*, you shall place this medicine into every well, so that all who drink the water shall perish from pestilence.” The Earth God replied: “The people here indeed do not believe in goodness and deserve destruction, but among them is one man, Lei Qiong, who makes his living selling tofu. He is kind-hearted, constantly cultivates good roots, and is generous in almsgiving. He must not be harmed.” The envoy said: “The good man shall be spared, but none others may be shown mercy.” He then handed the medicine to the Earth God.\n\nThe Earth God took the medicine, transformed into an old man, and waited by the well. Just then, Lei Qiong arrived to draw water for making tofu. The Earth God spoke from behind him: “Draw more of this water. Tomorrow at the hour of *si*, poison will be placed in it—whoever drinks it will die. Do not consume it.” Qiong turned to look but saw no one. Startled, he thought to himself: “If a divine being descends tomorrow to poison the well and destroy the entire village, how can I know of this and conceal it, preserving only my own life? Better that I die instead. If I can save the village, it will be my hidden merit.” The next day, as soon as dawn broke, he waited by the well to see if the words would prove true. Indeed, an old man approached, holding a packet of medicine, about to drop it into the well. Qiong rushed forward and seized it. The Earth God was alarmed and tried to snatch it back, but the old man swallowed it in one gulp. Instantly, he collapsed, his limbs turning black with pestilence. The Earth God, greatly shocked, carried the old man’s three *hun* and six *po* to the Heavenly Palace to see the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor, moved by the report, appointed Lei Qiong as Marshal of Majestic Pestilence. He was given a hat of the common people, a golden flower, and a golden plaque inscribed with the four characters “Unbound by Heaven or Earth,” allowing him to pass freely through the celestial gates and descend to assist the masters below. Lei Qiong thanked the Emperor and petitioned for the village’s pardon, which the Jade Emperor granted. Returning to Banzhu Village, Qiong appeared in the dreams of the villagers, urging them to reform and cultivate goodness. He then went to pay respects to his master. The master was overjoyed and led the group to another place—Shaanxi. There stood a mountain called Crimson Cloud Mountain, where a demon named Tian Wen dwelled, wreaking havoc. As the master and his company arrived, the Pestilence Marshal saw Tian Wen causing mischief and scattered the *Qiong* flower. Forged from the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth, its presence dispelled all malevolent forces, revealing only a jade cup and an iron tube. Lei Qiong captured them and presented them to his master, who was greatly pleased and bestowed them upon him for his use.\n\nLeaving Crimson Cloud Mountain, the group traveled onward until they reached a place called Spirit Screen Mountain. Within the mountain was a cave called Pure Seclusion Grotto, ruled by a demon named Shi Cheng. The demon wore a helmet like that of Erlang, his face pale with crimson lips, and wielded a thunder whip as his magical treasure, summoning the twelve earthly branches to aid him in battle. Deng, Xin, and Zhang arrived and, upon seeing him, hurled their own magical treasures. Shi Cheng, caught off guard, was captured and brought before the master. He kowtowed in submission. The master was delighted and wrote a memorial to the Jade Emperor, who issued a decree appointing him as Marshal of Divine Thunder and Stone, to follow the master’s command.\n\nThey journeyed further until they reached Gathering Tiger Mountain, where two demons lay in wait. One was named Wang Tie, pale-faced and wielding a long spear; the other was named Gao Tong, brandishing a pair of five-pronged axes. They often transformed into tigers by the mountain stream, dragging passersby up the mountain to devour at leisure. The master dispatched Zhao Shi to engage them in battle.\n\nMarshal Zhao fought them for over nine hundred rounds, yet neither side gained the upper hand. Marshal Zhao cast his Fire Rope, while the white-faced Wang Tie hurled his Flying Spear, summoning the Divine Tiger of the Eastern Mountain to snatch at Marshal Zhao. Gao Tong then flung his Jade Axes, calling forth the Divine Tiger of the Western Mountain to join the fray. Marshal Zhao, unable to withstand the assault, fled in defeat. Upon witnessing this, Marshal Ma the Divine Official cast his Fire Elixir into the air, scorching the horde of demons until nine out of ten lay wounded, forcing them to flee behind their gates. Marshal Ma then cast his Golden Bell, trapping the two demons beneath it. They were seized and brought before the master, who rejoiced. He wrote a memorial to the Jade Emperor, who issued a decree appointing them as Marshal Wang of Tiger Hill and Marshal Gao the Second, to follow the master’s teachings.\n\nWhat befell thereafter shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n**Meng Shan Releases Prisoners onto the Daoist Path**\n\nNow, the prison of Guangxi Prefecture held many convicts. Among them was a jailer named Meng Shan, who served in the prison. One year, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, the prisoners wept bitterly within their cells, their mournful cries shaking the heavens. Meng Shan asked, “Why do you not weep on other days, yet today each of you wails so sorrowfully?” The prisoners replied, “Though we are not good men, we still hold a shred of filial piety. As the year draws to a close and we cannot see our parents, our longing grows unbearable, hence our tears.” Meng Shan said, “Your words move me to sorrow. I shall do you a kindness—let me release you to return home for the New Year. But on the fifth day of the first month next year, each of you must return without fail, lest you bring trouble upon me.” The prisoners bowed in gratitude, vowing earnestly before departing. When the first month of the following year arrived, they indeed returned and gathered, entering the prison once more. Meng Shan checked the prison register—all eight hundred were present—and rejoiced. From then on, every year on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he would release the prisoners to return home, and they would come back on the fifth day of the first month, ever grateful for his virtue.\n\nOne day, Meng Shan said, “If you are willing to reform and become good men, I shall release you for good—what say you?” The prisoners replied, “If you, Warden, are willing to free us, how dare we return to our wicked ways? Yet though you save us all, your own life would be forfeit—how could we flee?” Meng Shan said, “If you truly reform and turn from evil to good, I have a way to escape my fate. Do not worry for me.” The prisoners, hearing this, bowed in thanks and gradually departed the prison, scattering to distant lands.\n\nA month later, Prefect Teng Gongyi descended to the prison and found not a single soul. Shocked, he questioned Meng Shan. Meng Shan reported, “I released them, and they will return shortly.” The prefect flew into a rage, ordering Meng Shan to be flogged forty times and sent to retrieve the eight hundred prisoners. Bearing the punishment, Meng Shan took up a spear and left the prison. Arriving at a place called Tile Ridge Mountain, he planted his spear in the ground and sighed, “Though my superior punishes me today, I bear no resentment. To sacrifice my life to save eight hundred doomed souls—how could I regret it?” Just as he was about to impale himself on the spear, the Earth God transformed into a white hare and knocked the spear aside. Meng Shan lunged three times, and three times the white hare thwarted him. The Five Emperors, hearing of his plight, immediately dispatched the Floating Heaven Lord with a jade decree, appointing Meng Shan as Marshal Meng of Fengdu, to wear a commoner’s hat adorned with a golden flower, wield a Yellow Dragon Spear, and ride a cloud of azure. He was ordered to the northern lands to assist the master. Meng Shan entered court to give thanks, then paid his respects to the master, who rejoiced.\n\nThey journeyed onward until they reached a place called Chen Sand Land. There dwelled a demon named Yang Biao, who wrought havoc in the area, devouring people insatiably. Beneath the earth, he had dug countless pits; any traveler passing through at dusk would fall in, whereupon Yang Biao would seize and consume them. As the master and his generals advanced, they saw demonic clouds swirling, shrouding Chen Sand Land. The master said, “Ahead, demonic clouds rise—there must be a fiend within. Which of you generals dares to ride forth and subdue it?” Marshal Zhao charged forward at once, only to tumble into a stone pit, unable to battle Yang Biao. Seeing Marshal Zhao fall, the master was alarmed and strode forward with his sword to rescue him, only to fall into the pit himself. The Fire and Water Generals rushed forward and leapt in, carrying the master out. The Water General performed a spell, transforming into an inverse dragon that split the pit into a great river, allowing them to fight their way out. Seeing the pit collapse, the demon attempted to flee but was too late—Marshal Zhao seized him and brought him before the master. A jade decree arrived, appointing Yang Biao as Marshal of the Earth Spirits, to wield a warrior’s weapon and assist the master in his teachings. The master rejoiced and bestowed upon Yang Biao a Fire Elixir, which he consumed before joining their ranks.\n\nLeaving Chen Sand Land, they arrived at a place called Dragon Gate Stockade, where a demon named Li Zhailong had conjured a barrier to block their path. Marshal Zhu cast his Five Poisons Bag, capturing the demon and bringing him before the master. A jade decree arrived, appointing him as Vanguard Marshal Li, to wield a bronze hammer, wear a helmet emblazoned with the character for \"valor,\" and follow the master in vanquishing evil. Marshal Li gave thanks and paid his respects to the master, who bestowed upon him a Fire Elixir to consume.\n\nWhat transpired thereafter shall be revealed in the following chapter.\n\nThe master’s journey to subdue evil at Mount Taibao continues. After departing Dragon Gate Grotto, the master arrived at Purple Clarity Cave, where a demon named Fu Ying barred their path. At his waist hung a magical treasure called the Demon-Illuminating Mirror—when tossed into the air, its flash would instantly daze all who beheld it. As the master and his company advanced, Fu Ying blocked their way. The generals brandished their weapons to seize him, but the demon hurled the mirror aloft. In an instant, the generals reeled, their vision blurred and heads spinning. Startled, the master charged forward himself, only for the demon to deploy the mirror once more. The master swiftly pointed his sword toward the south, summoning the fire of bing and ding to smelt the mirror, rendering it useless. Seizing the demon, the master accepted Fu Ying’s prostration and plea for surrender. He bestowed a Fire Elixir upon Fu Ying, who consumed it, then drafted a memorial to the Celestial Emperor. A jade decree arrived, appointing him as Inspector Vice Marshal, to follow the master in subduing evil.\n\nThe master then proceeded to a mountain called Mount Taibao, where thirteen demons wrought havoc, known as the Thirteen Taibao. Each year, they demanded twelve local children—six boys and six girls—as offerings, claiming countless lives. Their names were: Chao Wen, Wu Qing, Zhou Wang, Peng Gan, Fan Yi, Zhang Shen, Li Lu, Wang Li, Wu An, Liu Gang, Tian Neng, Shen You, and Zhu Li. Each possessed supernatural powers. When confronted by celestial soldiers, they needed only to strike their own bodies, and their foes would writhe in agony, easily captured.\n\nOn the fifth day of the fifth month, the Thirteen Taibao emerged for a leisurely outing, only to encounter the master’s company. Blocking their path, the demons met the generals, who charged forward to engage them. The demons struck their own bodies, and the generals cried out in pain. The Tortoise and Serpent Generals swiftly bore the master away, while Marshal Ma hastened to his aid. The master said, “Though I have escaped, these demons will surely pursue. What manner of beings are they, wielding such power?” Marshal Ma replied, “I believe only the Three Pure Ones can unravel this mystery.” The master and Marshal Ma immediately journeyed to the Three Clarities Temple, where they paid homage to the Three Pure Ones and recounted the events.\n\nMaster Miaole said, “These demons are no ordinary beings. Their progenitor, a deity now governing the southern and northern realms, is a man named Yin Gao. Only by summoning him can these demons be subdued.” The Three Pure Ones, having heard this, dispatched Master Miaole to the Water-Fire Mountain at the southern and northern border to seek Yin Gao.\n\nMeanwhile, Yin Gao was stationed at Water-Fire Mountain, guarding the southern and northern border, when the perfected one arrived bearing a divine decree. He promptly emerged to receive the visitor, who, after formalities, said, “The Golden Tower’s incarnation has descended to the mortal realm to quell the black qi. Upon reaching Mount Taibao, he encountered a band of demons he could not subdue and sought the aid of the Three Pure Ones. By their decree, you are to assist the master without delay.” Yin Gao departed the southern and northern border and accompanied the master to Mount Taibao, where two demons—Yellow Pennant and Leopard Tail—blocked their path. Yin Gao sighed, “You wretches! I have not called upon you for ages, yet here you are, stirring up mischief!” He immediately performed a ritual, exhaling a killing qi that suffused the earth with golden light, revealing his true form as the Great Year Star—three-faced and four-armed. The two demons, unable to flee, exposed their true forms: two leopard tails from within a spear. Yin Gao seized them and, with the master, proceeded to the Taibao Stockade, where the Thirteen Taibao awaited.\n\nYin Gao engaged them in battle, but was soundly defeated and returned to the master. The master grew anxious, but Yin Gao said, “Do not fret, Master. Though I could not overcome them, my teacher, Master Sa, resides in the Southern Heavenly Grotto. If I beseech him, he will surely subdue these demons.” The master replied, “If you have such a teacher, hasten to seek his aid.” Yin Gao took his leave and journeyed to the Mystic Teaching Palace in the Southern Heavenly Grotto, where he found Master Sa seated in meditation. After paying his respects, Yin Gao was asked, “Disciple, why have you come in such haste?” Yin Gao recounted the events at Mount Taibao. Master Sa said, “Zhenwu is the Golden Tower’s incarnation. I shall accompany you to assist him, for no other could succeed.” With that, he gathered his magical treasures and, with Yin Gao, returned to the master. Their reunion brought great joy.\n\nAt dawn the next day, Yin Gao and Master Sa advanced to the battlefield, their war cries shaking the heavens. The Thirteen Taibao emerged in full armor to meet them. Just as they prepared to employ their magic against Yin Gao, Master Sa sprayed a mist from his Water-Containing Vessel and cast two ropes—one white, one red—into the air. The ropes ensnared the Thirteen Taibao, binding them into a single chain. Their true forms were revealed: thirteen skeletal remains. Master Sa placed a Fire Elixir within each skull and instructed Yin Gao, “Wear one skull upon your head and hang the remaining twelve around your neck. You shall follow the master in his teachings.” Yin Gao accepted the command, and the master expressed his gratitude. Master Sa then took his leave, ascending upon a cloud.\n\nThe Jade Emperor was memorialized, and his decree arrived, appointing Yin Gao as the Earthly Controller of Slaying the Malevolent Star, the Most Virtuous and Venerable Divine Marshal Yin, Commander of All Slaying Deities Under Heaven. Yin Gao expressed his gratitude and departed with his master. What transpired thereafter shall be revealed in the following chapter.\n\n---\n\n**Master Sa Subdues the Wicked King in Henan**\n\nNow, there was a Perfected One named Sa Shoujian, who practiced medicine and saved the people. One day, he arrived in Henan and came upon a temple called the Temple of the Overseer. The temple deity was named Wang E, who each year on the sixth day of the sixth month demanded that the local people prepare ten sheep, ten oxen, ten pigs, and ten jars of wine for his festival. If they failed, he would spread pestilence to harm the people. The village elders, driven to poverty, pawned their wives and sold their sons and daughters—truly a pitiful sight.\n\nUpon learning of this, the Perfected One set fire to the temple and burned it to the ground. Seeing the divine radiance of the Perfected One, Wang E dared not resist and fled. After burning the temple, Sa Shoujian departed for Huizhou.\n\nWang E then commanded his lesser demons to spread pestilence. Alas, in one village, nine out of ten households fell ill. At night, he appeared in the dreams of the villagers, demanding that they rebuild his temple. If they refused, he threatened to set their houses ablaze. The people lived in constant dread.\n\nOne day, Wang E went out and saw a family named Sun, whose daughter, a maiden of eighteen named Qianjin, was exceedingly beautiful. That night, he transformed into a young man and seduced the girl. After more than a month, Qianjin was no longer recognizable as herself. Her family was deeply distressed.\n\nOne day, the Patriarch arrived in Henan and sought lodging at the Sun household. Seeing Sun Shou’s gloom, the Patriarch asked, “We are mendicants, seeking shelter for the night before continuing our journey tomorrow. Why does the elder seem so troubled?”\n\nSun Shou replied, “It is not that I am displeased with your stay. I have a matter weighing on my heart.” The master asked, “What is it?” Sun Shou said, “I have a daughter, eighteen years of age, who has been bewitched by some ghost. He claims to possess divine powers, and this has left me deeply troubled.”\n\nThe Patriarch grew furious upon hearing this and said to Sun Shou, “This poor monk shall capture this demon for you, in repayment for your kindness.” Before he could finish speaking, a fierce wind arose, and in midair appeared a man nine feet tall, his face black as iron, brandishing a golden whip.\n\nSun Shou exclaimed, “That is the one!” The Patriarch immediately ordered Marshal Ma to engage him in battle. Huaguang received the command, wielding his master’s spear, and ascended into the clouds, cursing, “You vile demon, dismount and surrender at once! If you are brought before the Heavenly Court, you may yet live. Refuse, and your life shall be forfeit in an instant!”\n\nWang E flew into a rage and swung his whip to strike. The two fought in midair for over three hundred rounds without either gaining the upper hand. Wang E then revealed his divine power, hurling his golden whip into the air, from which countless whips rained down. Marshal Ma responded by tossing his golden brick. They fought for another fifty rounds, still evenly matched.\n\nThe Patriarch drew his sword to join the battle. Wang E, his strength waning, could no longer resist. He withdrew his whip and fled in defeat. Huaguang unleashed his fire chariot, fire crows, and fire elixirs in pursuit. The Patriarch pointed his sword, and the demon transformed into a streak of golden light, fleeing toward Huizhou Prefecture.\n\nThere, he encountered Sa Shoujian, who was performing a ritual. Seeing Wang E, the Perfected One grew enraged and declared, “This demon dares to appear here again!” He raised his command tablet, recited an incantation, and the demon could not escape. Sa Shoujian captured him and ordered a heavenly general to escort Wang E to the Patriarch.\n\nThe heavenly general brought Wang E before the Patriarch, saying, “This official knew you had descended to subdue the dark qi, so I have brought this general to submit to you.” The Patriarch was pleased. He gave Wang E a fire elixir to consume and wrote a memorial to the Jade Emperor. The imperial decree arrived, appointing him Marshal Huoluo Wang and bestowing upon him a golden tablet inscribed with the words “Loyal and True of Heart.” He was to obey the laws and follow the master’s teachings. Wang E expressed his gratitude.\n\nThe Patriarch said, “Your nature is most unyielding. Now that you have turned to goodness, if you do not change your former ways, how can you bear the words ‘Loyal and True of Heart’? Should your heart remain insufficient, the Jade Emperor will hold you accountable, and by then, regret will be too late.”\n\nWang E laughed heartily and replied, “A true man’s word can revive a nation. To know one’s faults and correct them is to be a good man. How could there be any hesitation? This humble general, having been taken in by the master, from this day forward, will accept no bribes and show no favoritism. If anyone follows my teachings, I shall protect them. If anyone extorts money from the people, I shall strike them dead.”\n\nThe Patriarch smiled and said, “Your words are just, but you must also take compassion as your foundation.” Marshal Wang respectfully acknowledged the command.\n\nThe Patriarch then addressed his assembled followers, “I descended from the Heavenly Court over thirty years ago. The dark qi across the land has nearly been subdued. Last night, I observed carefully and saw that only in the West does a demonic cloud linger, refusing to disperse.”\n\nHe turned to Marshal Zhu and instructed, “There remains a demonic cloud in the West that will not dissipate. Take the Five Poisons Bag and subdue it completely before returning.” Marshal Zhu received the order and set forth for the West. He cast the Five Poisons Bag into the air, but the dark qi could not be contained.\n\nReturning, they reported these events to the Patriarch. The Patriarch then went with all his generals, each casting their dharma treasures into the air, but the qi surged even more fiercely.\n\nThe Patriarch said, “What can be done about this?” He resolved, “I shall go and consult my master, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy, to devise another plan.”\n\nHaving spoken, he went to see the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy. The Heavenly Worthy asked, “Why have you come?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied, “This disciple descended to the mortal realm to subdue the dark qi, and now it is nearly all gathered. Only in the West does a lingering black cloud refuse to disperse. My disciples and I cannot subdue it, so I have come to seek your guidance.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said, “That black qi is an evil star, now trapped within the heavens of the Buddhist teachings. It cannot escape, and thus is difficult to subdue. Only with the aid of a perfected Buddhist disciple can it be gathered.”\n\nThe Patriarch asked, “Where might such a disciple be found?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied, “To the west, on Snow Mountain, there is a prince who practices with utmost devotion. He is the son of King Chu and has now achieved success. You must first go to Flame Lamp Buddha to receive the prediction and become a disciple of the Buddhist teachings. Then, entrust Flame Lamp Buddha to summon the prince of Snow Mountain. Only then can the black qi within the heavens of the Buddhist teachings be subdued.”\n\nThe Patriarch bowed in gratitude, took leave of the Heavenly Worthy, and descended to the mortal realm. He instructed Marshal Deng and the others to wait in the world below while he, accompanied by Marshal Ma, went to the West to pay homage to Flame Lamp Buddha.\n\nUpon seeing the Patriarch and Marshal Ma, Flame Lamp Buddha asked, “Limitless-Prime, you have paid homage to countless buddhas, and Marshal Ma is the manifestation of Mañjuśrī Tathāgata from the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss. Why have you come here?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied, “This disciple’s spiritual powers are meager, and I have come to pay respects to my revered master.”\n\nFlame Lamp Buddha said, “You are a disciple of the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy and an emanation of the Golden Portal. Why would you bow to this humble monk as your master?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied, “To return to the true fruit, one must practice the Way of the Fifty-Three Visits.”\n\nAfter receiving the Patriarch’s bow, Flame Lamp Buddha smiled and said, “Disciple, though you bow before me, I know you have come because of the star’s qi in the West. For this matter, I must summon the prince of Snow Mountain, and only then can this qi be eradicated.”\n\nFlame Lamp Buddha then commanded Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra to go and fetch the prince. Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra said, “He is but a mortal cultivating the Way. How can we be certain of his attainment? How can we lightly summon him?”\n\nThe Buddha smiled and said, “Since you two do not believe, I shall transform something to test him, and then you will see.”\n\nThe two received the command and departed. Mañjuśrī transformed into an eagle, and Samantabhadra into a sparrow. They arrived at Snow Mountain, where the prince sat in pure meditation upon his altar. Mañjuśrī, as an eagle, swooped down to seize the sparrow, which fled into the prince’s embrace. The eagle pursued and, speaking in human words, said, “I was hunting that sparrow, and you have taken it into your arms. Now I must eat what you have saved. Will you offer your flesh to me?”\n\nThe prince replied, “If you are hungry and wish to eat my flesh, there is no knife here to cut it. Go and fetch a sharp bamboo, and I will cut my flesh for you.”\n\nHearing this, the eagle flew away. It then transformed into a tiger, chasing a white rabbit, which again sought refuge with the prince. Seeing this, the prince once more sheltered the rabbit within his altar. The tiger, speaking in human words, said, “You have saved it, and now I shall starve. You cannot save both.”\n\nThe prince replied, “The rabbit is too small to satisfy your hunger. Go below, and I shall fall to you.”\n\nThe tiger complied and waited below. The prince cast himself down from the altar. In an instant, heavenly flowers blanketed the earth, and a golden lotus arose, bearing the prince to the Western Paradise, where he entered to see Flame Lamp Buddha. After receiving the prediction and paying homage, he met the Patriarch.\n\nThe Patriarch said, “I beg you, elder brother, to accompany me below to subdue the demon. There will be a great reward.”\n\nThe prince replied, “This humble monk has only just entered the Western Paradise and possesses no spiritual powers. How can I assist others?”\n\nFlame Lamp Buddha said, “The Patriarch is an emanation of the Golden Portal. You may accompany him below to gather the black qi and return. It will not be too late to attend the sutra teachings in the Central Heaven.”\n\nThe prince bowed in gratitude and descended with the Patriarch to the mortal realm, where they met the assembled generals. At dawn the next day, the Patriarch and the prince arrived at the western frontier. The air resounded with their battle cries as they called for the demon to surrender.\n\nSuddenly, the demonic cloud appeared before them, and from within emerged a monk, who called himself the Iron-Headed General.\n\nThe Patriarch said, “I see you are tonsured and robed, with prayer beads around your neck. You must be one from the heavens. Why have you descended to the mortal realm, unleashing black qi to harm the people below?”\n\nThe monk replied, “I remain in my own place. You have come seeking me, not I you.”\n\nHe swung his iron alms bowl at the Patriarch, who met the attack with his sword. The Patriarch could not overcome the demon and was about to press forward when the demon, sensing the true qi, fled into the Iron Robe Cave. The Patriarch rallied his generals, and they pursued, tightly besieging the cave entrance. Each general cast their dharma treasures into the cave, but none could harm the demon.\n\nThe prince struck his skull drum, and the demon within the cave grew dizzy and disoriented. Stumbling out, he was seized by Marshal Li and brought before the Patriarch. The demon refused to submit.\n\nMarshal Ma said, “This wretched creature will not yield. Iron belongs to the metal class, and fire can overcome metal. I shall burn this wretch to death.”\n\nThe demon laughed, “How amusing, how amusing! Burn me clean if you will—I shall never submit to you.”\n\nThe generals then said, “Since fire cannot consume him, iron must fear clay. Order the Clay Star to transform into a mound of yellow earth, with fire raging within, and cast the monk into it.”\n\nUpon hearing this, the demon sighed, “Do not do so—I yield, I yield!”\n\nGreatly pleased, the Patriarch bestowed upon him a Fire Elixir pellet to swallow. He then sent the prince back to the heavenly courts to attend the Flame Lamp Buddha and listen to the sutras. A jade decree arrived, appointing the demon as the Fierce Iron Marshal, wielding an iron staff to follow the Patriarch in the Dao. But what transpired later? Tune in to the next chapter for the unfolding tale.\n\n---\n\nThe Patriarch Gains the Thunder Gods as Disciples\n\nThe Patriarch departed the western lands and journeyed onward until he reached Stone Thunder Mountain, where legions of thunder gods dwelled, often appearing before mortals: the Five Directions’ Thunder Duke Generals, the Eight Directions’ Cloud-Thunder Envoys, the Five Directions’ Rain-Thunder Envoys, and the Thunder Division’s Marshal of Thunder.\n\nAt the foot of this mountain lived an elder named Shi Yuan, who had two daughters—one sixteen, the other fourteen—eating at home one day. As they sliced a winter melon, they tossed its seeds and pulp into the ditch beneath the kitchen stove. A Thunder Envoy, spying this from midair, mistook the refuse for rice and condemned the girls for their wastefulness. Instantly, he unleashed the Thunder Duke, who struck the two sisters dead.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the Thunder Duke saw they were melon seeds, not rice, and regretted his haste. He brought the matter before the Thunder Envoy, who said, “What’s done is done. We shall turn this error to purpose—I shall guide you both to the Heavenly Lord.”\n\n“What are your names?” he asked.\n\nThe girls replied, “I am called Zhu Peiniang, and my younger sister is Zhu Beiniang.”\n\nThe Thunder Envoy said, “I shall now initiate you two sisters. I grant you two Thunder-Electric Mirrors to keep and wield, and you shall be called Shadow-Blade Ladies. When I strike a person, you shall first release lightning to illuminate them clearly. To Zhu Beiniang, I give a skull and a fan, and you shall be called Moon Comet Lady, for when you strike, none can move.”\n\nThe two sisters received their orders without further remark.\n\nNow, the Patriarch arrived at Stone Thunder Mountain, where he heard the roar of thunder and saw flashes of lightning. He stepped forward and pointed with his sword, shouting loudly. All the Thunder Envoys emerged and, upon seeing the Patriarch, knelt before him. The Patriarch asked the reason, and the Thunder Envoys replied, “We brothers could not bear to part, so the Jade Emperor commanded us to undergo tribulation here.”\n\nThe Patriarch asked, “Will you submit to me?”\n\nThe Thunder Envoys said, “We brothers have no one to rely on, and we have heard that the Patriarch is the incarnation of the Golden Portal. How dare we not obey?”\n\nThe Patriarch, greatly pleased, said, “Since you are willing to submit to me, I shall enlist you as generals under my command. As you brothers cannot bear separation, you shall thunder in the south during spring and summer, and in the north during autumn and winter, thus preserving your fraternal bond.”\n\nThe Thunder Envoys, overjoyed, bowed in gratitude and pledged their allegiance. The Patriarch memorialized the Jade Emperor, who issued a decree: Zhu Peiniang was appointed Thunder Mother of the Thunder Department, and Zhu Beiniang was named Moon Comet Heavenly Lord. From the northeastern celestial realm, the Patriarch summoned Wind Master and Rain Master, entrusting them with the Wind and Rain Talismans to accompany him in his teachings. The Thunder Duke was appointed Great General of the Nine Heavens’ Thunderclap.\n\nThe Patriarch rejoiced. Seeing that the dark qi of the middle realm had dissipated and the people lived in peace, he led his generals into the Thirty-Three Heavens to pay homage to the Jade Emperor and report the events. The Jade Emperor was greatly pleased and granted the Patriarch a seat beside him on an embroidered stool.\n\nThe Jade Emperor said, “Now that the dark qi is fully dispelled, you may take your generals to guard the Southern Heavenly Treasure Virtue Pass. Do not delay, lest demons descend to disturb the lower realm.”\n\nThe Patriarch expressed his gratitude. The Five Emperors further bestowed upon him the titles Supreme Primordial Jade Void Master-Preceptor, Mysterious Heavenly Emperor, and Heavenly Worthy of Subduing Demons. He was placed in command of thirty-six heavenly generals, and every year on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he would descend with his generals to inspect the good and evil of the world. The Jade Emperor presented him with two cups of Golden Wave Celestial Wine and personally escorted him from the palace.\n\nThe Patriarch expressed his thanks, assembled his generals, and assumed his post. A grand banquet was held to reward the troops, and they took up their stations at the Heavenly Gate to receive the incense offerings of all beings. Thus, the Eternal Buddha was revered.\n\nThe titles of the generals under the Mysterious Emperor were recorded as follows:\n\nSupreme Primordial Master of Myriad Methods, Divine Merit and Wondrous Aid, Perfected Lord Xu;\nWhite Perfected Lord of the Eastern Sea, Bai;\nTeaching Patriarch of the Fruitful Strictness School, Primordial Lady Fu;\nMaster of the Cavernous Mystery School, Perfected Lord Xin;\nMaster of the Pure Subtlety School, Primordial Lady Wei;\nMaster of the Primordial Unity School, Perfected Lord Lu;\nMarshal Zhao, Commander of the Golden Wheel and Ruyi;\nGuan Yu, appointed Manifest Spirit Pass Marshal;\nYellow of Dragon-Raised Jade Field, appointed Marshals Gou and Bi;\nTortoise and Serpent, appointed Water and Fire Generals;\nZhang Jian, appointed Utterly Loyal Marshal Zhang;\nPang Qiao, appointed Primordial Marshal of Chaotic Qi;\nFu Ying, appointed Deputy Inspector Marshal;\nOrthodox Unity Numinous Official, Marshal Ma;\nZhu Yanfu, appointed Marshal Zhu, Punisher of the Unfaithful;\nGenerals Cui and Lu;\nLi Fulong, appointed Vanguard Marshal Li;\nYu Tian, appointed Marshal Yu of Subduing Demons and Dispelling Evil;\nDeng Cheng, Xin Jiang, and Zhang An, appointed Marshals Deng, Xin, and Zhang;\nRen Wubie and Ning Shikua, appointed the Two Guardians;\nLiu Jun, appointed Heavenly Lord Liu of the Jade Palace;\nLei Qiong, appointed Mighty Pestilence Marshal;\nShi Cheng, appointed Divine Thunder Marshal Shi;\nGuang Ze, appointed Wind Wheel Marshal Zhou;\nXie Shirong, appointed Fire Virtue Marshal Xie;\nShang Wei and Shi Kuang, appointed the Two Sages of Wisdom;\nKang Xi, appointed Benevolent and Holy Marshal of Integrity;\nGao Yuan, appointed Marshal Gao of Descending Birth;\nMeng Shan, appointed Fengdu Marshal Meng;\nWang Tie and Gao Tong, appointed Marshals Wang and Gao of Tiger Hill;\nWang Zhi, appointed Marshal Wang of the Nine Provinces’ Vast Rivers;\nThunder Duke, appointed Great General of the Nine Heavens’ Thunderclap and Fengdu Marshal Zhang;\nYang Biao, appointed Marshal Yang;\nYin Gao, appointed Celestial Marshal Yin of the Year Star;\nIron Head, appointed Fierce Iron Marshal;\nZhu Peiniang, appointed Thunder Mother of the Thunder Department;\nZhu Beiniang, appointed Moon Comet Heavenly Lord.\n\nThe Patriarch once more descended to the mortal realm to relieve suffering.\n\nNow, in the Yangzi River near Mount Wudang, there dwelled a water-snail spirit, a horse spirit, a snail spirit, and a bamboo-rope spirit. Seeing the Patriarch in the mortal realm, these spirits dared not cause trouble.\n\nUpon hearing of the Patriarch’s ascent to Heaven, the spirits stirred waves in the river, harming travelers and merchants, their grievances rising to the skies. The Patriarch, observing from Baode Pass, grew enraged and declared, “To cut the grass and remove the roots. I descended to the mortal realm for four years, sweeping away the dark qi. Yet these four demons still lurk in the rivers and mountains. Now, seeing me ascend, they dare to wreak havoc again. As the ancient saying goes, ‘If the grass is cut but the roots remain, new shoots will sprout.’”\n\nAt once, he performed a ritual, manifesting eighty-two transformations. Leaving one incarnation to guard Baode Pass alongside the marshals, his true form departed the heavens and descended straight to Mount Wudang to save the people. Arriving at the Yangzi River’s edge, the Patriarch worked his magic, summoning the Threefold True Fire to dry the waters. Seeing the river parched, the spirits rolled ashore—only to find the Patriarch standing there, wielding the Seven-Star Sword in ritual. At the sight of him, they fled. The Patriarch gave chase, and before ten rounds of combat had passed, all were slain. Only the snail spirit and bamboo-rope spirit escaped, their whereabouts unknown. Deeply troubled, the Patriarch returned to the celestial court, where he oversaw the marshals guarding the Heavenly Gate. He dispatched another incarnation to descend once more, stationing it at Mount Wudang to suppress the two remaining spirits and aid the people. Whenever official vessels faced peril on the river, the Patriarch would appear in midair, hair unbound and sword in hand, to rescue them. The dragon kings of the Five Lakes and Four Seas came to pay homage, while officials and merchants were frequently saved.\n\nA statue of the Patriarch was sculpted at the foot of Mount Wudang, and a temple was built to enshrine him. In a dream, the Patriarch instructed the people to craft thirty-six celestial generals, each wielding a demon-subduing Seven-Star Sword, treading upon a coiling serpent and the Eight Trigrams Tortoise. Whenever officials or commoners sailed past, the Patriarch would manifest to protect them, ensuring their safety. Those passing by the river would enter the temple to burn incense, and the sacred flames never ceased.\n\nIn the third year of the Yongle Emperor’s reign, the Yellow-Haired Tartars rebelled. The sovereign was alarmed and dispatched troops to meet them, only to suffer a crushing defeat. At the height of the crisis, a figure suddenly appeared in midair, sword in hand, accompanied by thirty-six celestial generals. They unleashed wind, thunder, and swarms of wasps, charging forward to slay the Tartar chieftains Dalicing, Dalihe, Gaomuer, and Dengjiahu. The Yongle Emperor, unaware of the deity’s identity, returned victorious to the court. He sent envoys to the Supreme Clarity Palace to summon the Heavenly Master Zhang.\n\nThe sovereign inquired, “When I clashed with the Tartars, I was defeated in battle. At the moment of greatest peril, a deity appeared in the sky—hair unbound, sword in hand, with a fair complexion and long beard—leading thirty-six celestial generals, accompanied by a tortoise and serpent, charging from the north to save my life. The Tartars were slain, and I returned to the court. I wish to repay this deity’s kindness, but I do not know which god it was. That is why I have summoned you today; surely you recognize him.”\n\nThe Heavenly Master replied, “The one with unbound hair and the tortoise and serpent is none other than the True Sovereign Emperor of the Northern Dao.”\n\nOverjoyed, the sovereign asked, “You say this is the Dark Heaven Sovereign. Where is his temple now?”\n\nThe Heavenly Master answered, “This deity attained enlightenment on his own, aiding all people. He rescues those in disaster and saves those in peril. Travelers on the river are all saved by him. The merchants long ago built a temple at the foot of Mount Wudang.”\n\nThe sovereign declared, “Even the common people know to repay kindness. My life and this realm owe everything to this deity. How could I forget? Since you say the original temple stands at Mount Wudang, I shall personally lead a procession there to burn incense and behold his likeness, building a temple to repay his grace.”\n\nHe issued an edict, commanding the civil and military officials, along with the Heavenly Master, to accompany him to Mount Wudang by the Yangzi River. The sovereign entered the temple to burn incense, and upon seeing the Patriarch’s statue—so like the figure he had witnessed—his heart swelled with joy. After the rites, he returned to the court and hosted a grand banquet for all officials.\n\nHe then decreed that General Jin supervise the construction, with the Marquis of Longping leading thirty thousand laborers and craftsmen to Mount Wudang. There, they built a golden hall, gilded the Patriarch’s statue, and erected thirty-six halls and seventy-two palaces. Lu Ban descended to assist, and within a year, the halls, palaces, and statues were complete. Generals Jin and the Marquis of Longping returned to the court to report the completion.\n\nThe sovereign was overjoyed and promoted General Jin three ranks. He selected forty-eight virtuous Daoist masters from across the land to serve as Daoist officials. The sovereign then ordered the Heavenly Master to conduct a seven-day, ten-night grand ritual, during which he would personally burn incense and pay homage.\n\nThe Marquis of Longping stepped forward and petitioned, “Your Majesty has now built the temple and sculpted the deity’s statue, fully demonstrating your sincerity. However, I fear that in the future, those who come to burn incense may lack the means to make offerings, and the stellar officials may go without sustenance. This is not a sustainable plan. I beg Your Majesty to bestow your boundless compassion and allocate funds from some source to ensure the eternal continuity of the sacred flames.”\n\nThe sovereign, greatly pleased, issued a decree granting five hundred *qing* of incense and lamp fields, along with one hundred *qing* of wheat and rice fields. Any damage to the temple was to be repaired, ensuring the sacred flames would burn for ten thousand generations.\n\nAs the sovereign prepared to feast with his ministers at Mount Wudang, a report came that a bell had floated up from the river, drifting ashore. The sovereign ordered it retrieved and brought into the great hall. It was a bronze bell cast from seven treasures, its sound carrying for a hundred *li*.\n\nThe sovereign, upon witnessing this, was overjoyed. He promptly departed Mount Wudang, ordering his procession to return to the capital with his assembled civil and military officials. The ancestral master of Mount Wudang displayed his mighty spiritual power, delivering those in distress and rescuing those in peril. The four seas grew calm, their waves stilled, and the people felt the grace of the deity. Filial sons and obedient grandsons who prayed for their parents, or those without children who sought heirs—none failed to receive divine response. His fame spread throughout the two capitals and the thirteen provinces, and those who came to burn incense and pray for blessings were beyond counting. The devout might find bolts of crimson silk drifting down from the heavens, draping themselves upon their bodies—a sign known as \"receiving the silken blessing.\" People from all corners of the realm, men and women, young and old, came in throngs, some prostrating with every step, all chanting the Buddha of Infinite Life. Every prayer met with a response. For over two hundred years since, the sacred flames have burned as brightly as ever, and the mountain has remained an eternal site of imperial veneration. The realm enjoys unbroken peace.",

      "translated_text": "*The Northern Journey*\n*Compiled by Yu Xiangdou of the Ming Dynasty*\n\n**Volume One: The Jade Emperor Hosts a Banquet for His Ministers**\n\nIt came to pass during the reign of Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty. One day, the Jade Emperor issued a celestial decree, commanding a grand feast to be held in the Tushita Palace of the Thirty-Third Heaven, summoning the Heavenly Lords Fu, Zhang, Xu, Li, Ge, and others. Upon receiving the decree, each Heavenly Lord arrived in due order. After the ceremonial prostrations and salutations were complete, the Jade Emperor spoke:\n\n\"For five hundred kalpas, I have stood at the pinnacle of the cosmos, laboring day and night without respite. Yet upon close reflection, the Central Heaven under my rule is not even a ten-thousandth part as splendid as the Western Paradise. Today, I have gathered you, my ministers, to devise a way for me to journey to the Western Realm, escape the cycle of kalpas, and listen to the Buddha’s teachings—only then shall I be free from all cares. If any among you can chart this path for me, it shall be counted as your merit.\"\n\nThe assembled Perfected Lords presented their memorial: \"In the mortal realm, one who cultivates immortality for seven lifetimes without breaking the precepts may ascend to serve Your Majesty. But to enter the Way in the mortal realm, one must first break the precepts for nine lifetimes before being reborn in the West. Your Majesty has always been an immortal—how could you enter the Western Paradise? To escape the cycle of birth and death, you must abandon your celestial form, leave the heavens, and cultivate as a mortal. Only then can you attain Buddhahood. Otherwise, it cannot be done.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the Jade Emperor let out a long sigh, and a thought of descending to the mortal realm arose in his mind. Suddenly, he noticed a golden-flowered tree across from him, its radiance dazzling, golden blossoms rising from its branches. The Jade Emperor asked, \"What is that shimmering brilliance before us? It fills me with admiration.\"\n\nGe, the Heavenly Lord, stepped forward and memorialized: \"This is no ordinary thing. Beyond the Nine Heavens of the Southern Xun Palace lies the residence of Heavenly Lord Liu, where stands a golden-flowered tree called the *Tree That Touches Heaven*. This tree gathers all manner of treasures, and its radiance is the glow of those very treasures, hence the golden light that shines so brightly.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the Jade Emperor immediately summoned the Fire Virtue Lord of the South and commanded him to visit Heavenly Lord Liu’s residence to request the celestial tree. The ministers withdrew from court, and the Star Lord, having received his orders, departed to the Southern Xun Palace to seek the *Tree That Touches Heaven* from Heavenly Lord Liu.\n\nNow, Heavenly Lord Liu was seated in his hall when he suddenly saw the envoy arrive. He welcomed him and bade him sit. Heavenly Lord Liu asked, \"Noble envoy, what brings you here with such a mandate?\"\n\nThe Star Lord replied, \"His Celestial Majesty was hosting a banquet when he beheld the radiance of your esteemed tree, its brilliance captivating him. He has dispatched this humble official to your residence to request this treasure.\"\n\nHeavenly Lord Liu said, \"How could I dare refuse such a request? Yet this tree has been passed down through generations in my family, and from it, the Seven Treasures manifest without cease. If Your Majesty were to take this tree, I fear that upon moving it, the Seven Treasures would scatter, the light would fade, and it would no longer flourish. It would truly be of no use. I humbly ask that the envoy return and memorialize the Jade Emperor, lest this treasure be harmed in vain.\"\n\nThe envoy, having heard these words, took his leave and returned to memorialize the Jade Emperor, recounting all that had transpired. Upon hearing this, the Jade Emperor grew furious and exclaimed, \"As the sovereign of all under Heaven, am I not even equal to Heavenly Lord Liu, who possesses such a tree that births the Seven Treasures, its radiance illuminating all, a wonder beyond words?\"\n\nHe then turned to his ministers and asked, \"Who is able to constantly enjoy the use of this tree?\"\n\nThe ministers memorialized: \"Only the descendants of Heavenly Lord Liu’s family are permitted to manage and enjoy this tree.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the Jade Emperor suddenly sighed aloud, \"How might I become one of his descendants and enjoy this treasure? Then my heart would be truly content!\"\n\nThe ministers, hearing the Jade Emperor’s words, were all astonished. They stepped forward and memorialized, \"The Sage does not speak idly. Since Your Majesty has uttered these words, you must be prepared to relinquish your throne and be reborn in the mortal realm.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor’s thoughts remained fixed on the *Tree That Touches Heaven*, and he disregarded the hardships of descending to the mortal realm. He replied, \"I shall follow your counsel. But if I go, who shall rule in my stead?\"\n\nThe ministers again memorialized: \"Your Majesty’s three souls may be divided. You may designate one soul to descend and be reborn in the mortal realm.\"\n\nUpon hearing that he must divide his three souls and send one forth, the Jade Emperor could not help but shed tears. The ministers memorialized, \"Once the Sage’s words are spoken, how can they be retracted? Without trust, there is no foundation. Your Majesty should swiftly issue the decree.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor said, \"Though I designate one soul to descend today, when shall it be complete?\"\n\nThe ministers memorialized: \"Your Majesty need not worry. Once the task is accomplished and perfection attained, you shall return to your original form.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor had no choice but to designate one soul to descend. The ministers each emitted a beam of golden light, which carried the soul straight to Heavenly Lord Liu’s residence to be reborn.\n\nNow, Heavenly Lord Liu and Princess Red Lotus were strolling in their rear garden when they suddenly saw a golden light descending from the center of the heavens. Within it were the Four Heavenly Kings, the Eight Great Vajrapani, and nine azure dragons, bearing a golden tray. Upon the tray lay an infant, and they descended straight into the garden.\n\nThe princess asked Heavenly Lord Liu, \"What is this?\"\n\nHeavenly Lord Liu replied, \"It must be a person of great nobility in distress, seeking to be reborn. My lady and I should pay our respects.\"\n\nUpon hearing her husband’s words, the princess immediately lit fine incense, and the two of them bowed in reverence. As they watched, the golden light drew nearer and entered the princess’s embrace. Heavenly Lord Liu was overjoyed and bowed in thanks to the heavens.\n\nWithin a month, Princess Red Lotus conceived. She informed Heavenly Lord Liu, who was overjoyed and declared, \"Since you are with child, this must surely be a person of great nobility.\"",

      "translated_text": "Time flew like an arrow, and before they knew it, a year had passed. On the ninth day of the ninth month in the third year of Yuanhuang, the chamber filled with an extraordinary fragrance. Suddenly, the princess could no longer bear the pain and gave birth to a son. Clouds gathered from all directions, shrouding the room in mist so that no one could be seen. A maidservant was sent to inform Heavenly Lord Liu, who rejoiced greatly. He named the child Liu Changsheng.\n\nThe days passed swiftly like a shuttle, and another three years went by. One day, Changsheng asked his parents, \"Does our family have any fine treasures?\"\n\nHis parents replied, \"Our family has the Sky-Reaching Tree, which radiates shimmering light and rises with purple qi, naturally producing the Seven Treasures. Some years ago, the Jade Emperor admired it and came to request it, but we did not give it to him.\"\n\nThe boy said, \"If we have such a fine treasure, let us go and see it.\"\n\nHeavenly Lord Liu did not stop him and took Changsheng to the garden to see the Sky-Reaching Tree. Upon entering the garden, Changsheng indeed saw the tree, its radiant light piercing the heavens and its purple dew ascending into the clouds. Overjoyed, he burned incense before the tree every morning and made offerings to it.\n\nNow, within the tree originally resided the Many-Treasures Tathāgata, the Treasure-Victorious Tathāgata, the Wondrous-Form Tathāgata, the Vast-Victorious Tathāgata, the Detached-from-Dust Tathāgata, the Nectar-King Tathāgata, and the Immeasurable-Life Tathāgata—these Seven Treasure Tathāgatas had long dwelled in the tree, which was why it possessed such marvelous qualities. Seeing that the Jade Emperor, now reborn here, made such earnest offerings, the Tathāgatas could not accept them and discussed among themselves before departing.\n\nOne day, Changsheng entered the garden again to make offerings, only to find the tree’s bark and leaves withering, its light entirely gone. Greatly alarmed, he gazed at it for a long while and said to himself, \"Yesterday, it was still full of treasures—why is there nothing today? There must be a reason. I shall see if it returns tomorrow.\" With that, he left the garden.\n\nNow, the Seven Treasure Tathāgatas, unaware of the Jade Emperor’s intentions, saw that he made offerings morning and night with such devotion. They discussed the matter and went to the Hall of the Three Purities to ask the Three Pure Ones about the Jade Emperor’s purpose.\n\nUpon arriving at the Hall of the Three Purities and greeting the Three Pure Lords, the Tathāgatas said, \"We seven have dwelled in this estate for over a hundred kalpas. We did not know the Jade Emperor had come here to be reborn. Every day, he makes earnest offerings to us. We dare not accept the Jade Emperor’s veneration, so we left the Sky-Reaching Tree and came to this hall to seek your counsel. We do not understand the Jade Emperor’s intentions.\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones—Jade Purity, Supreme Purity, and Grand Purity—sighed and said, \"If we did not tell you, you would indeed remain ignorant. One day, the Jade Emperor held a feast for his ministers. He saw a brilliant golden light opposite him, unaware that it was the radiance of you seven. Upon seeing it, he asked his ministers, who reported that it was the Sky-Reaching Tree in Heavenly Lord Liu’s home. Seeing the treasure’s light, the Jade Emperor grew covetous. He sent envoys to retrieve it, but they failed. He then asked his ministers, 'I greatly desire this tree. Since I cannot obtain it, who could rightfully possess it?' His ministers replied, 'Only his descendants could rightfully have it.' Upon hearing this, the Jade Emperor’s greed knew no bounds. Suddenly, he sighed and said, 'If I could become his descendant and enjoy this tree, my heart would be content.' His ministers, startled, immediately petitioned the Jade Emperor to descend and be reborn. With no choice, the Jade Emperor sent one of his souls to take a transformed body and be reborn in Heavenly Lord Liu’s home. Now, seeing you seven, his former greed remains unresolved, which is why he offers you such rich gifts. The Jade Emperor’s sacred heart is now entangled in worldly toil due to his greed, and it may be difficult for him to return. Even if he does, it was because he coveted you that this came to pass—this is not advantageous for you either. One of you seven should transform into a Daoist and exhort him to cultivate the Way. Another should transform into a Daoist and wait beneath the Sky-Reaching Tree. When Changsheng comes to make offerings and sees the tree withered and dull, he will surely be angry. If he sees you by the tree, he will accuse you of stealing the treasure and harming the tree. When he seeks to confront you, reveal your divine powers and enlighten him to cultivate the Way.\"\n\nThe Tathāgatas bowed and took their leave of the Three Pure Ones. One transformed into a Daoist and deliberately sat beneath the Sky-Reaching Tree in Liu’s home.\n\nThe next day, Changsheng went to the rear garden and saw the tree withering, its treasure-light completely vanished. His heart was filled with sorrow. The following day, he returned to the garden and found the tree nearly dead, its radiance entirely gone. Enraged, he suddenly saw a Daoist behind the tree. Changsheng seized him and demanded, \"I wondered why the tree had died and its treasures vanished—so it was you, a wild Daoist, who stole them!\"\n\nThe Daoist did not answer, only smiling faintly. Changsheng, furious, dragged him out of the garden and into the hall to interrogate him. The Daoist merely smiled again. Seeing that he would not respond, Changsheng beat him with a stick, but the stick broke, and the Daoist did not cry out in pain. He then struck with a blade, but the blade snapped, and the Daoist transformed into a streak of golden light and rose into the air.\n\nChangsheng was terrified and bowed to the heavens, saying, \"I, unworthy as I am, did not recognize the immortal and offended your sacred body. I beg forgiveness for my transgressions.\"\n\nThe immortal replied, \"I am no other than one of the Seven Treasures within your tree, which once manifested treasures in your home.\"\n\nChangsheng asked, \"Why did you rely on the tree for its radiance?\"\n\nThe immortal said, \"My six brothers and I, seeing that the Heavenly Palace lacked treasures, relied on the tree to manifest our forms, illuminating the Thirty-Three Heavens and displaying our divine powers.\"",

He was determined to ascend to the Thirty-Three Heavens, but Lord Liu and Princess Honglian pleaded desperately to keep him, to no avail. Suddenly, within the Ninefold Heaven, a mass of black clouds drew near, and a fierce wind arose, snatching the child from the palace. As the black clouds dispersed, Lord Liu and his wife found their son gone and wept bitterly—this need not be recounted further.\n\nThe assembly of Tathāgatas carried Longsheng beyond the palace and led him straight to the Hall of the Three Pure Ones, where they recounted the earlier events. Upon seeing Longsheng, the Three Pure Ones invited him to rise after he bowed, then seated him among them.\n\nThe Three Pure Ones asked, \"Do you recognize who we are?\"\n\nLongsheng replied, \"I have never met you before and do not know the honorable immortals.\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones smiled and said, \"Do you know who you were in your past life?\"\n\nLongsheng answered, \"I truly do not. I beg the immortal masters to enlighten me. If I am destined for the immortal’s bond, I shall never forget your kindness.\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones said, \"Look into the Heavenly Mirror in our inner hall and see who you are.\"\n\nLongsheng went to the mirror and gazed into it, where he saw the image of the Jade Emperor. Startled, he returned and said to the Three Pure Ones, \"When I looked into the mirror, I saw the form of the Jade Emperor. Could it be that my former self was the Jade Emperor?\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones replied, \"Indeed.\"\n\nLongsheng asked, \"If my former self was the Jade Emperor, why was I cast out of the Thirty-Three Heavens and reborn beyond the Ninefold Heaven?\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones said, \"You were one of the Jade Emperor’s souls. In your past life, upon seeing the radiance of Lord Liu’s Seven Treasures Tree, you grew greedy and willingly cast aside the cycle of life and death, thus falling beyond the Ninefold Heaven to satisfy your desire.\"\n\nLongsheng asked, \"How may I restore my true and original form?\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones replied, \"This is not difficult. To regain your true form, you must cultivate upright conduct, study the Dao, and refine your authenticity. Only then can you return to your origin.\"\n\nLongsheng said, \"Where in Heaven shall I cultivate?\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones answered, \"There is no suffering in Heaven. If you wish to return as before, you must descend to the mortal realm.\"\n\nLongsheng asked, \"How can an immortal embryo enter the mortal realm?\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones said, \"If you are willing to cultivate with a steadfast heart, there is Penglai Mountain in the middle realm—the foremost mountain under Heaven. We shall perform a ritual to cast you down to the mortal realm.\"\n\nLongsheng asked, \"Who will attend to my meals?\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones replied, \"When hungry, eat the green pine; when thirsty, drink the sweet spring.\"\n\nLongsheng said, \"If I may restore my original form through cultivation, I am willing to follow your teachings.\"\n\nThe Three Pure Ones then drew from their sleeve a Ruyi Flower stem.

      "translated_text": "The Kingdom of Gege’s King Cheng’an issued a decree one day, summoning civil officials Zhang Ming and Li Tao, along with military officers Liu Feihu and Zheng Zheng, and the entire court of civil and military ministers. They readied their bows and arrows and set forth for Penglai Mountain to hunt and roam its peaks. The ministers received the decree and, donning their armor, followed the king’s procession—this shall not be further recounted here.\n\nThe narrative now divides. As for Longsheng, ever since the Three Pure Ones cast him down to Penglai, he had built a thatched hut to cultivate the Dao. When hungry, he ate the green pine; when thirsty, he drank the sweet spring, never daring to stray even half a step. For twenty years he had dwelled upon the mountain in cultivation. One day, as he sat in meditation, the beasts of the mountain—driven and pursued by the king’s soldiers—all gathered before his meditation seat. Some knelt, some bowed, some kowtowed, some cried out, some wailed, all bearing expressions of sorrow and terror. Though Longsheng had not witnessed the king’s pursuit, he saw the beasts’ distress and their pleading demeanor, as if seeking refuge.\n\nLongsheng addressed the beasts: “From your manner, I surmise you are in peril and seek my aid?” The beasts nodded and cried in response. Longsheng said, “If that is so, take shelter behind my mountain.” Hearing this, the beasts hurriedly fled behind the hut. Before long, King Cheng’an arrived with his retinue. The king asked Longsheng, “Have you seen any beasts pass this way?” Longsheng sat in silence, unmoving. The king asked again, and again Longsheng did not respond. Enraged, the king ordered his generals to sever the hermit’s limbs. Longsheng merely smiled faintly, still silent. The king, further incensed, declared, “Do you dare mock me, thinking I cannot take your head?” He commanded his warriors to dismember the Daoist into ten thousand pieces. In an instant, clouds darkened the sky and earth, yet Longsheng remained whole, his limbs restored as before.\n\nThe king was struck with awe. Clasping his hands, he prostrated himself and said, “This humble one, with mortal eyes, failed to recognize a celestial immortal. I have offended the heavenly decree—pray, celestial one, show mercy and pardon my transgression. I beg you to return with me to the palace. I shall dismiss my ministers and accompany you back here to cultivate the Dao.” Longsheng sighed and said, “Your Majesty is already an immortal—why seek the Way?” The king pleaded repeatedly, entreating Longsheng to return to court, for he was resolved to renounce the world and cultivate. Longsheng took up his brush and composed a poem for the king, who read:\n\n*For twenty years on Penglai I’ve stayed,*\n*Hunger fed by pine, thirst by spring’s cascade.*\n*From my humble hut afar I see—*\n*Your Majesty, too, once walked the immortals’ way.*\n\nAfter reading the poem, the king kowtowed again and said, “The celestial’s verse reveals that I, too, once belonged to the immortal ranks. Now, having lost my original face, I beg you, great immortal, to return with me to court and guide me back to the path.” Longsheng replied, “Since Your Majesty is determined to renounce the world, this humble one shall accompany you.” The king rejoiced, and with his civil and military officials, followed Longsheng back to the palace. The ministers dispersed, while the king and the Grand Master Longsheng feasted in the Jingle Palace.\n\nThe queen, Princess Yutang, hearing that the king had welcomed a celestial immortal to the palace—one of such awe-inspiring power—emerged from her chambers to pay homage to the Grand Master. Gazing upon him, she saw a man of noble bearing, his features refined and striking, his lips crimson, his teeth white. Enamored, she teased, “Such beauty in a celestial! If I could bear you a prince tomorrow, as fair as you, my heart would be content.” The Grand Master, startled by her words, composed a poem in reply:\n\n*The Dao is cultivated in the red dust of the mortal world,*\n*Its root lies in discipline and conduct unfurled.*\n*Should palace women tempt me to folly’s sway,*\n*This life shall pass—no return another day.*\n\nAs the Grand Master finished speaking, his dharma protector, watching from midair, saw the line *“no return another day”* and surmised that the king’s lingering worldly attachments had not yet dissolved. The protector transformed into a palace maid and descended from the heavens to admonish the Grand Master. Standing before his altar, the maid asked, “Do you know who I am?” The Grand Master replied, “You are a palace attendant.” The dharma protector said, “You do not recognize me—I am your protector, Zhu Li. I heard your vow to the queen in your poem, pledging to return. Since ancient times, sages do not speak carelessly; careless words bind one to the wheel of rebirth. You must go to the queen, fulfill your poetic vow, and wed her—only then may you reenter the Buddha’s realm.”\n\nHearing this, the Grand Master wept bitterly. The maid vanished into the sky, and the Grand Master, overcome with grief, fell gravely ill. Within seven days, he passed away. When King Cheng’an learned of this, he wept bitterly and prepared a coffin, burying the Grand Master on Purple Gold Mountain. Seven days later, the queen, grieving for the Grand Master’s death, also perished. The king mourned deeply and had her interred beside the Grand Master on Purple Gold Mountain. He then named Consort Deng as his new queen.\n\nThe Grand Master transformed into a golden light and entered Consort Deng’s womb. On the eighteenth day of the eleventh month in the *jiawu* year, at the hour of noon, she gave birth to a son—his features dignified, his countenance refined. King Cheng’an rejoiced and named him Xuanming.\n\nMeanwhile, the late queen, after her death, was reborn into a wealthy family surnamed Li. On the day of her birth, the entire chamber filled with fragrance, and she was named Xiangniang.",

Instructing Longsheng to close his eyes, they struck him with it, sending him into the mortal realm upon Penglai Mountain.\n\nWhat befalls him later shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n*Meanwhile, the court ministers and lord go hunting...*",

The envoy, having delivered it to the Goge Kingdom, was announced by the court herald and brought before the king. The emissary proclaimed, “My sovereign declares that as there is no fixed order among nations, we must determine which is greater. Our kingdom possesses a bronze drum twelve inches thick. My lord commands that it be presented to your kingdom. If anyone here can shoot an arrow through it, your kingdom shall be deemed the superior state. If none can, then yours shall be the lesser, and you must pay annual tribute to our kingdom.”\n\nUpon hearing this, the king grew furious and issued a royal decree: whoever could shoot through the bronze drum would be promoted in rank. The nation’s guardian general, Liu Feihu—a warrior of unmatched valor, whose arms bore the strength of a thousand men—stepped forward and declared, “Your Majesty, do not fret. Though the Western Barbarians have sent this drum, I can pierce it.” The king rejoiced and bestowed upon him three cups of imperial wine. Liu Feihu received the honor, hung the drum in the hall, drew his bow with his left hand, and nocked an arrow with his right. He loosed the shot, but the arrow penetrated only half an inch into the drum. His face flushed with shame as he prostrated himself upon the golden steps. The king was deeply vexed.\n\nPrince Xuanming, then only seven years old, had heard the commotion from the palace. He emerged and addressed the king: “No one else can shoot through this drum—only your child can.” The king replied, “The barbarian drum is twelve inches thick. Even General Liu Feihu, whose might is unmatched by ten thousand men, could not pierce it. You are but seven years old—how could you possess such strength?” The prince said, “Strength is not a matter of size. Father, rest easy and watch your son shoot.” The king was overjoyed.\n\nThe prince had the drum hung high, then stood a hundred paces away in the golden hall. Drawing his bow with his left hand and nocking an arrow with his right, he summoned the barbarian envoy and asked, “If I pierce this drum, what then?” The envoy replied, “We shall pay tribute to your kingdom year after year.”",

      "translated_text": "\"If I fail to pierce the drum, we shall pay tribute to your kingdom instead.\" The prince shouted, \"If I shoot through this drum, your head shall fall to the ground as well.\" The barbarian envoy, thinking the prince could not possibly succeed, gave a faint, mocking smile.\n\nThe prince spoke no more. Taking aim at the bronze drum, he loosed an arrow—it struck true, burying itself to the fletching and piercing the drum clean through. The assembled generals roared their approval, and the king was overjoyed. The prince immediately ordered the envoy’s execution, and his head was displayed as a warning. Turning to the remaining barbarian soldiers, the prince commanded, \"I ought to behead you all as well, but I shall spare your worthless lives. Return and tell your king to hasten his tribute, lest my kingdom march to war.\" The barbarian soldiers, trembling with fear, fled in disarray.\n\nThe king held a grand feast and gathered his ministers, but of what followed, more will be told in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\n**The Prince Leads Troops to Repel the Barbarian Army**\n\nNow, the barbarian king, Goritian’er, ascended his throne. To his left stood his civil ministers, Maodahai and Li Yiyun; to his right, his generals, Jian Kaipowuzhu and Shun Qing. After the assembled officials had paid their respects, a messenger announced, \"The barbarian soldiers have returned from their mission.\" The king summoned them forward. The soldiers reported how the prince of the Goruo Kingdom had shot through the bronze drum and executed their envoy. Enraged, the barbarian king issued a decree: he would dispatch fifty thousand troops, with Maodahai commanding the army, Jian Kaipowuzhu as vanguard, and Shun Qing as deputy general. Each was granted three cups of imperial wine before they took their leave, marching straight toward the Goruo Kingdom.\n\nMeanwhile, the king of Goruo, now sixty-one years old and seeing his son’s prowess, held a grand feast for his ministers and abdicated the throne to the prince. The prince, after a hundred prostrations, ascended the throne at the tender age of thirteen, declaring the first year of the *Dingda* era. The ministers paid their respects, and the prince hosted a banquet to celebrate the peace.\n\nYet before three months had passed, one day as the prince held court, a messenger announced, \"The Western Barbarian king, Goritian’er, has sent Maodahai to lead fifty thousand troops against our kingdom.\" Upon hearing this, the prince flew into a rage. He ordered General Zhao Shineng to take command of the army, with Ma Mengming as vanguard and Li Shiji as deputy general, to confront the barbarian forces.\n\nZhao Shineng accepted the decree and left the court, leading his troops to camp at the Sword Pass. At dawn the next day, the two armies faced each other on the battlefield. The barbarian general Wuzhu rode forth, and Ma Mengming of the southern army met him. After a fierce battle, Ma Mengming was soundly defeated and retreated into the pass. The following day, Zhao Shineng personally led the main army out to challenge the barbarians. The barbarian general Maodahai also advanced with his forces. From morning until afternoon, the southern army fought valiantly but could not overcome the barbarian generals, suffering a crushing defeat and retreating into the pass, where they barred the gates and dared not emerge. A messenger was dispatched with a report to King Dingda.\n\nUpon receiving the missive, the king was furious and wished to lead the campaign himself. His ministers pleaded against it, and the king demanded, \"If I do not go, what strategy remains?\" The ministers replied, \"There is no commander-in-chief in the court. We beseech Your Majesty to issue a proclamation—if a great general can be recruited, what fear is there that the barbarian forces will not retreat?\" The king agreed and immediately posted an imperial notice. But of what followed, more will be told in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\n**The Heavenly Worthy Instructs the Jade Emperor**\n\nNow, the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Joy, observing from the heavens that the Jade Emperor had incarnated as the king of the Goruo Kingdom, thought to himself: *If I do not go to enlighten and guide him in cultivation, his golden body may be destroyed, and he will struggle to return to his original form.* With that, he transformed himself in the clouds, becoming a Daoist priest. Descending to the mortal realm, he arrived at the Five Phoenix Tower and tore down the imperial notice.\n\nThe next day, as King Dingda held court, a messenger announced, \"A Daoist priest has come to the tower and taken down the proclamation.\" The king ordered him brought forward. The priest entered the hall and paid his respects. The king asked, \"You have taken down my notice—what ability do you possess to repel the barbarian army?\" The priest replied, \"Though I am unworthy, I have received teachings from an extraordinary master. I can command flying sand and rolling stones, summon wind and rain—what fear is there of barbarian troops? I can scatter them like wind flattening grass.\"\n\nThe king, overjoyed, asked, \"How many soldiers will you require for this campaign?\" The priest answered, \"Not a single one.\" The king said, \"The barbarian generals number in the dozens, and their troops fifty thousand. You claim to need no soldiers, yet go alone—I fear you will be outnumbered.\" The priest replied, \"Your Majesty need not worry. This humble servant has his own methods.\" The king, greatly pleased, allowed him to proceed.\n\nThe priest left the court and traveled straight to the Sword Pass, where he met Zhao Shineng. The next morning, the barbarian army once again besieged the pass, hurling insults. A soldier rushed to report the taunts. The priest took leave of the generals, ascended the pass’s tower, unbound his hair, and grasped his sword. Holding a seven-star blade in one hand and a bowl of clear water in the other, he recited true incantations. Then he ordered the gates opened.\n\nIn an instant, the sky darkened, and earth grew dim. Sand and stones flew through the air, hurtling toward the north. The priest shouted from the tower, and the southern soldiers surged forth to join the battle. The barbarian troops, unable to flee, panicked, their heads and limbs battered until they were crushed. Of the fifty thousand barbarian soldiers, not one escaped alive.\n\nAlas! When Master Yu observed this scene, he composed a poem in lament:\n*Sand flies, stones swirl in a murky haze,*\n*The mighty army wails, a hive of bees in disarray...*",

Overjoyed, the king summoned him to court and received the customary acclamation. The king declared, “This realm is mine, yet without you, it could not be preserved.

If I do not swiftly deliver him, I fear it may harm his golden body.”\n\nHaving spoken, he descended to the mortal realm and entered the king’s presence. The king asked, “What brings you here today? Do you seek office?”\n\nThe Daoist stood upon the golden steps and replied:\n*“I have heard of Han Emperor Wu,*\n*And even Qin’s First Sovereign—*\n*Both craved the arts of immortals,*\n*Yet never met a guide to the transcendent realm.*\n*Though you have encountered one who knows the Way,*\n*You remain deluded, lost in reckoning.”*",

His ministers, civil and military, all prostrated themselves upon the golden steps and petitioned, “Matters of the netherworld are difficult to verify—how could Your Majesty heed the Daoist’s words and abandon a kingdom of ten thousand chariots?”\n\nThe king heard their plea as though the wind had passed by his ears, not listening to a single word. He immediately issued an edict summoning the crown prince to court to ascend the throne. The prince, weeping bitterly, tried to dissuade his father. When the news spread throughout the palace, all came forward, pleading with a thousand words, yet none could sway him. The king was resolute in leaving the household life, and the prince had no choice but to take the throne. The palace ladies dispersed, and the king, the queen, and the prince could not bear their parting.\n\nThe king composed a poem:\n*“How could I bear to leave this land of brocade and silk?\nYet I cannot part from my beloved wife and child.\nFearing that death may come if I delay even slightly,\nI sever the dust of the mortal world to escape delusion.”*\n\nAfter inscribing the poem, the queen and prince lingered in sorrow, unwilling to let the king go. Yet the king’s heart was as hard as iron, not a single tear falling—his mind was set on leaving the household. The ministers and the prince escorted him out of the court, and after thirty *li*, the prince, overcome with grief, wept aloud. The king said, “My son, do not shed tears. A father’s resolve to depart cannot be stayed. Say no more of other matters—only hold the realm as your foundation, filial piety as your foremost duty, and ensure the people do not suffer.” With these words, he parted from the prince and went on his way.\n\nThe prince collapsed in despair, and the ministers helped him onto his horse to return to court, where he ascended the throne. The first year of his reign was named the *Kaiming* era. The prince granted a general amnesty throughout the land, and the ministers offered their congratulations. But what befell thereafter shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\nThe king, having bid farewell to his ministers, the queen, and the prince, journeyed alone for a day. As dusk approached, he suddenly saw the Daoist coming toward him. The king bowed in reverence. The Daoist said, “You have come at last—all is settled.” The king replied, “Master, my heart is set on leaving the household—what remains unsettled?” The Daoist said, “Your kingdom is wealthy—now you depart.” The king answered, “Master, my heart yearns for the Dao and leaving the household—why would I return to enjoy my former kingdom?” The Daoist said again, “The mountains are harsh—hunger and cold await.” The king replied, “With my whole heart seeking the Way, how could I fear hardship?”\n\nThe Daoist smiled faintly and said, “Since you are truly resolved to leave the household, follow me into Mount Penglai.” The king assented and followed him deep into the mountain. There, he beheld:\n*Peach blossoms and willows in full bloom before his eyes,\nGreen mountains faintly rising, a sight to praise.\nCranes cry and apes howl—he hears them near,\nA scene of divine creation, beyond compare.\nYoung pines and cypresses stand in rows,\nClouds drift o’er peaks where rare flowers grow.\nFrom the cliffs, cascades crash in a ceaseless flow,\nA view of ten thousand years’ worth, none could bestow.*\n\nNow, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy had transformed into a Daoist, guiding the king to Mount Penglai, where they built a thatched hut. Day and night, he expounded the scriptures and preached the Dharma to the king. One day, the Heavenly Worthy, testing the king’s progress in seated meditation, feared his worldly attachments were not yet severed. He devised a plan, saying, “I crave a peach—go down the mountain and buy one to offer me.”\n\nThe king assented and immediately left the mountain to purchase the fruit. Meanwhile, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy, seeing the king depart, transformed himself into a beautiful young woman and went to the market to sell peaches. When the king saw the woman carrying peaches, he approached to buy some. The woman said, “This peach is the only one borne by its tree—it costs a thousand taels of gold.” The king laughed, “Even if it were the sole fruit of the tree, it is not worth a thousand gold.” The woman replied, “If you will not pay a thousand gold, I, a widow, see that you are a man of noble bearing. I would gladly offer you the peach and become your wife—what say you?”\n\nThe king said, “I am one who has left the household.” The woman said, “Returning to lay life is an ancient principle. My family possesses great wealth—if you do not reject me, you could enjoy it all. If you remain obstinate, you may regret it too late.”",

Then he saw the woman again, carrying peaches and approaching him. She said, “Do not let this chance slip by—such an encounter will not come again.” The king still did not answer. The woman continued, “If you truly refuse in this life, will you at least grant me the bond of our next existence? Then I shall give you this peach.” The king thought to himself, *“How can one know what the next life holds? If I agree, it will do no harm. If I refuse, I will have no peach to bring back—how then shall I face my master?”* So he said to the woman, “I may grant the next life, but in this one, I absolutely cannot comply.” The woman smiled and said, “Since you have agreed to the next life, I entrust this peach to you—do not go back on your word.” The king took the peach, overjoyed, and said to himself, *“Had I not promised her the next life, how would I have obtained this peach?”* Delighted beyond measure, he returned to the mountain and presented the peach to his master, the Heavenly Venerable. The Heavenly Venerable reverted to his true form, took the peach, and said, “Disciple, you went down the mountain to buy peaches—why have you broken the precepts?” The king was greatly startled and replied, “Master, what do you mean? This disciple went down the mountain without the slightest transgression—how could I have broken the precepts?” The Heavenly Venerable smiled and said, “Did you not pledge to that woman a vow for the next life?” The king answered, “I dare not deceive you, Master. This disciple searched everywhere for peaches but found none, save for a woman selling one. When I tried to buy it, she demanded that I become her husband before she would sell it to me. I refused. Then she said that if I would not consent in this life, I should at least promise her a predestined bond in the next, and she would give me the peach. Had I not agreed, I would have returned empty-handed and failed to see you, Master. So I promised her the next life—though it was merely a desperate expedient, not a true commitment. Clearly, this was but a lie on my part—how could it count as breaking the precepts?” The Heavenly Venerable smiled again and said, “Disciple, you are deluded. Since ancient times, once a word is spoken, not even a team of four horses can retrieve it—how can it be a lie? Now that you have pledged to that woman a bond for the next life, all your past merit is undone, and you must fall back into the mortal realm.” Hearing this, the king wept bitterly and asked, “Can this be avoided?” The Heavenly Venerable replied, “The Way of cultivation is strict, and Heaven and Earth are impartial—how could it be avoided? You must be reborn and cultivate anew before you may enter the Dao.” The king kowtowed and pleaded, “If it cannot be avoided, I beg you, Master, in your compassion, let me fall into a place without love or attachment, so that I may swiftly attain the immortal path.” The Heavenly Venerable said, “Where is there a place without love or attachment? You have planted good roots, but it was a momentary lapse in thought that has brought this upon you. Now, if you are to be reborn, you will surely enter a virtuous household in your next life—there is no need for sorrow.” The king asked, “Master, where shall I be reborn?” The Heavenly Venerable replied, “With my wisdom-eye, I see that the king of Xixia has practiced goodness for three generations, yet has no heir. He is now performing rituals to pray for one. You shall be reborn there.” Upon hearing this, the king wept uncontrollably and refused to eat for seven days before dying. The Heavenly Venerable cast the king’s body into the sea, where fish and crabs consumed it, fulfilling his vow of relinquishing the flesh.

One day, he ascended the throne and gathered his civil and military officials to deliberate, saying, “This year, I have turned forty, yet I have no son to inherit the throne. What is to be done?”\n\nThe civil officials Peng Liang, Peng Li, and Zhou Shirong, along with the military officers Guo Chun and Yue Riji, along with the assembled ministers, petitioned, “We have heard that for those who pray for an heir, only the Heavenly Rites of Offering yield results. Your Majesty may fast and purify yourself, then perform the rites—perhaps Heaven will grant you a son.”\n\nThe king followed their counsel and ordered Meng Ying, the commander of the palace guards, to erect an altar and select an auspicious day for the rites. On the chosen day, Queen Mo Shanxuan accompanied the king as they personally ascended the altar to offer incense. The Heavenly Venerable, with his wisdom-eye, saw this and cast the three *hun* and seven *po* souls into the queen’s womb.\n\nA month after the rites concluded, the queen indeed conceived, and the king rejoiced, hosting a grand feast for his ministers. Time passed swiftly, like an arrow loosed or a shuttle thrown, and Queen Mo Shanxuan carried the child for three years and sixty days without giving birth. One day, the king ascended the throne in a fury and summoned the queen from the palace, demanding, “Since ancient times, women have carried children for ten months before birth. You have borne this child for so long—surely it is an unnatural pregnancy. I suspect you, and I intend to kill you.”\n\nThe queen was terrified and pleaded, “Ever since Your Majesty performed the rites, I have received your favor and conceived this child. How could it be unnatural? I beg you to grant me three more days in the palace. If I still do not give birth, I will take my own life before you.”\n\nThe king’s anger subsided, and he granted her request. The queen returned to the palace, tears streaming down her face, and sighed, “I harbor no ill intent. Who knows what sins I committed in a past life? Now, married to a man of the highest nobility, I remained childless at forty, and this strange pregnancy will cost me my life!”\n\nBefore she could finish speaking, a voice cried out from her womb, “Mother, do not worry. I am a virtuous soul reborn. If Father is angry, tell him that in ancient times, the Most High Lord Lao once remained in his mother’s womb for eighty-three years.”\n\nThe queen replied, “Though it is said that the Most High Lord Lao once did so, you claim to be a virtuous soul reborn. Yet your father does not believe me, and he has given me only three days. Even if you are a good person, if you do not emerge, your father will execute me in three days, and you will be unfilial.”\n\nThe child in her womb answered, “Mother, do not worry. This unworthy one will leave your womb tonight at the hour of *xu*. I only fear it may startle you.”\n\nThe queen said, “Then be quick and be born. If you do, I will die without regret.”\n\nAs she spoke, her belly began to ache faintly, and the sounds of labor arose. The palace maids rushed to attend her. At the transition between *you* and *xu*, the Patriarch emerged from his mother’s womb. It was the third day of the third month in the first year of the Zixue era, at the hour of *xu*. A radiant glow filled the room, and an extraordinary fragrance permeated the air. The maids looked and saw that it was a boy. They hurried out to report to the king.",

He bestowed upon the prince the name *Xuánhuǎng*. The court then withdrew.\n\nTime passed swiftly, and in the blink of an eye, the king of Xixia once more enjoyed fifteen years of peace. One day, the king ascended the throne, and after the morning court session, he addressed his ministers: “I am now fifty-eight years old, and my years have grown heavy upon me. I am weary of governing the state. The crown prince has come of age, and his filial piety is commendable—he is fit to rule the realm. Today, I shall abdicate the throne in favor of Prince Xuánhuǎng. What say you all?”\n\nThe civil and military officials prostrated themselves and replied, “Your Majesty is a ruler of benevolence, and the crown prince is a sovereign of filial devotion. How could this be improper?” The king was greatly pleased and immediately summoned the prince. When the prince arrived at the hall and the ceremonial chants were completed, the king personally presented the imperial seal to him. The prince performed the twenty-four prostrations and knelt to receive the jade seal. The king then retired to the Palace of Repose, while the prince turned to ascend the throne. He issued a general amnesty throughout the land and feasted his assembled ministers. He then decreed the selection of thirty-six palace consorts and seventy-two concubines. Having ascended the throne at the age of fifteen, he governed the realm in peace for another fifteen years.",

At the transition between *you* and *xu*, the Patriarch emerged from his mother’s womb. It was the third day of the third month in the first year of the Zixue era, at the hour of *xu*. A radiant glow filled the room, and an extraordinary fragrance permeated the air. The maids looked and saw that it was a boy. They hurried out to report to the king.",

      "translated_text": "Queen Regent Fan of the Central Palace bore a son named Jichang, who at twelve years of age was already bright and quick-witted.\n\nThe narrative now turns elsewhere. Thirty years had passed since the Venerable Miaole sent the Three Spirits and Seven Souls of the Patriarch to the Western Glow. Fearing the Patriarch might grow insatiably greedy and lose his original nature, one day the Venerable, gazing from the clouds, saw the king setting out to pay a visit. Riding an auspicious cloud, he descended outside the city of the Western Glow, intending to turn the Patriarch back from his path. From afar, he saw the king’s procession approaching. The Heavenly Venerable transformed himself into a Daoist, sitting motionless by the roadside, silent as a clay Buddha. The advance guards shouted at him to move, but he did not stir. They reported this to the king, who said, “If he fears not the solitary one, he must be a man of the Dao and virtue. Let us go and see.”\n\nWhen the royal carriage drew near, the Daoist still did not rise. The king, observing his dignified bearing, thought him a good man. He ordered his attendants to halt the carriage and alighted to greet the Daoist, who then rose and returned the courtesy. The king asked, “Why do you sit by the road, silent and unmoving? There must be a reason.” The Daoist replied, “I have no other reason, only that I see Your Majesty has taken a wrong turn and wish to point out your error.” The king said, “I have guides to lead the way. How could I have gone astray? Why do you presume to instruct me?” The Daoist answered, “Your guides can only ensure you do not err on the paths of this life in the world of light. I come to guide you on the paths of the next life in the world of darkness.” The king said, “From your words, you claim to know the paths of future lives. Are you then an immortal?” The Daoist replied, “A mountain dweller.” The king asked again, “How can you know the future?” The Daoist said, “To know this life is to know the next; to know the height of joy is to know the depths of sorrow; to know reunion is to know parting. Not only the next life—even a hundred lives hence may be foreseen.” The king said, “How can this be?” The Daoist recited:\n\n*“Fame and profit are but fleeting blooms, gulls on the water;\nWine, lust, wealth, and wrath are oxen that drag one on.\nPleasure passes lightly before the eyes,\nYet in the end, all is but a withered husk.”*\n\nHe added, “Long ago, Emperor Wu of Liang composed these lines.”",

The Daoist’s countenance remained unchanged as he replied, “Slaying this poor Daoist is of no matter. But might I ask, Your Majesty—what being were you in a former life?” The king said, “I do not know. Do you?” The Daoist answered, “How could this poor Daoist not know?”\n\nThe king said, “You claim to know a hundred lives—how can this be verified? These are clearly words to evade death.” The Daoist laughed loudly and said, “If there is no proof, then my words must be taken to the grave.” The king asked, “What proof can you offer?” The Daoist said, “Order a basin of water brought, and look into it—you will see.”\n\nThe king, upon hearing this, immediately commanded Han Tong to fetch a basin of water.

      "translated_text": "Hearing these words, the king was greatly alarmed. Prostrating himself upon the ground, he pleaded, “This humble one wishes to take refuge under the immortal master. I would abandon my kingdom—where should I cultivate the Way?”\n\nThe Daoist, still suspended in midair, replied, “With a true heart devoted to the Buddha-Dao, enter Vulture Peak early.”\n\nThe king assented repeatedly, obeying the command. Seated upon the Azure Radiance Pavilion, he addressed his assembled ministers: “I now renounce the throne to leave for Vulture Peak. You, my ministers, need not follow. Return to the court and enthrone my eldest son, Jichang, that he may ascend the throne. Each of you must serve the realm with loyal hearts.”\n\nThe ministers prostrated themselves and remonstrated: “Many in the world seek cultivation—how could one of mortal flesh attain immortality? Moreover, Your Majesty rules as sovereign, cherishing the people as your own children. How could you suffer the retribution of rebirth among beasts? This must surely be sorcery. We beg Your Majesty to reconsider carefully, lest you regret it in days to come.”\n\nThe king replied, “My resolve to depart cannot be stayed, nor can your counsel dissuade me. Even in death, I shall not return to the kingdom. Say no more.”\n\nThe ministers had no choice but to comply. They again petitioned: “If Your Majesty must go, allow several hundred men to escort you, that we may set our minds at ease.”\n\nThe king smiled. “While in the kingdom, I knew this body existed; as a renunciate, I shall know it no more. What need have I for an escort? Speak no further.”\n\nThe ministers could only watch as the king departed, their eyes following until he vanished from sight. Then they returned to the court.\n\nThe king, alone, entered the mountains. The Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy was already seated beneath a stone cliff. At the sight of him, the king bowed and said, “I beg the master to guide this disciple, lost upon the path.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied, “You have come. Rise and stand beside me, and listen to my exposition of the Dharma.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy then revealed the original face, expounding upon the cycles of yin and yang, the hells of rebirth, and the practices of asceticism and seated oblivion for self-cultivation. The king prostrated himself in gratitude.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy continued, “Now face the heavens and receive the precepts.” The king knelt before the sky. The Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy administered the Five Precepts on his behalf, expounding the sutras and preaching the Dharma. Then, mounting the clouds, the Heavenly Worthy ascended into the heavens, leaving the king alone in the mountains to cultivate. He ate pine needles when hungry and drank from flowing springs when thirsty.\n\nThe narrative now divides. The ministers returned to the empress and the crown prince, recounting in full the encounter with the Daoist who ascended into the sky and the king’s departure for Vulture Peak. The empress and the crown prince wept bitterly, wishing to prepare an escort and join the prince in searching for the king.\n\nThe ministers advised, “The realm cannot be without a ruler for a single day. If Your Majesty wishes to seek the king’s return, you must first enthrone the crown prince. After forty-nine days, you may then leave the court to search.”\n\nThe empress consented. The crown prince, Jichang, was enthroned, and the era was named the first year of *Sichang*. A general amnesty was declared, and a feast was held for the assembled ministers.\n\nOn the forty-ninth day, the empress commanded the crown prince to visit Vulture Peak and see his father. The prince ascended the throne and issued an edict, ordering the preparation of three carriages: one for himself, one for the empress dowager, and one empty, to await the king’s return. He instructed the officials, great and small, to carry fine incense and burn it along the way. He also commanded the imperial guards Li Tong and Wu Jin to lead three thousand imperial forest troops to escort them to Vulture Peak.\n\nUpon receiving the edict, the ministers arranged orderly processions with reed pipes, flutes, drums, and music, advancing slowly until they reached the foot of Vulture Peak. They searched the entire mountain but found no trace. Later, they came to a place surrounded by verdant pines, where cranes danced on the left and gibbons cried on the right. There stood a great stone cliff, over eight *zhang* deep, within which sat the king upon a meditation mat. His form was no longer human—his bones were emaciated like kindling.\n\nThe empress and the crown prince, seeing him, rushed forward and embraced him, weeping bitterly. The ministers were all moved to sorrow. The empress and the crown prince knelt, pleading for their father to return, but the king sat in silence, uttering not a word.\n\nIn an instant, a great wind arose, and clouds swirled so thickly that faces could not be seen. A violent gust blew the king away—none knew where. When the clouds dispersed and the mist cleared, the empress and the crown prince looked again, but the king was gone. The prince wept aloud.\n\nThe ministers approached and advised, “The clouds and mist obscure all—this is heaven’s will, severing the bond of our king’s love. Now that he has vanished without a trace, he cannot be found. The empress dowager and Your Majesty should return to the court. We shall post proclamations: if anyone learns of the king’s whereabouts, we may then deliberate further. Otherwise, he cannot be found. Grieving will avail you nothing.”\n\nThe prince consented and returned to the court with his mother.\n\nWhat transpired later shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: The Patriarch Attains the Dao and Meets the Emperor**\n\nNow, the crown prince returned to the court. The Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy descended from the midair with the king and said, “You must cultivate diligently. If you achieve merit in three years, I shall return.”\n\nThe king assented repeatedly, obeying the command. Day and night, he sat in arduous cultivation, eating pine needles when hungry and drinking water when thirsty.\n\nTime passed swiftly, and unnoticed, three years had elapsed. One day, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy arrived and asked, “Disciple, do you understand the Dao?”\n\nThe king replied, “I do not.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy asked again, “Do you understand worldly affairs?”\n\nThe king again answered, “I do not.”\n\n“Do you understand life and death?”\n\n“I do not.”\n\n“Do you know you have a body?”\n\n“I do not.”",

      "translated_text": "The Heavenly Worthy, seeing that the king understood nothing of the affairs between Heaven and Earth, recognized that his heart had died and entered the Dao. With a faint smile, he said, “Your merit is complete.”\n\nThe king asked, “How have I achieved success?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied, “Your heart has turned to cold ashes.”\n\nThe king asked, “What more should I do?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said, “I bestow upon you five auspicious clouds to ascend to the Central Heaven and pay homage to the Jade Emperor.”\n\nThe king, upon hearing this, kowtowed in gratitude. Together with the Heavenly Worthy, he ascended to Heaven. First, they visited the Three Clarities Pavilion to pay respects to the Three Pure Ones, who offered their congratulations. The next day at morning court, the Jade Emperor ascended the throne. After the assembled perfected beings had paid their respects, the Three Pure Ones stepped forward and memorialized, “Your subject, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy, has accepted a disciple—a cultivator from the Kingdom of Western Glow who has attained the Dao—and brings him to see Your Majesty.”\n\nThe Jade Emperor, having heard this, commanded that he be summoned. After the king had thrice prostrated himself, the Emperor asked the assembled immortals, “What rank should he be granted?”\n\nThe immortals memorialized, “This is but one of Your Majesty’s transformed souls; the decision rests with you.”\n\nThe Jade Emperor, startled upon hearing this, bade the king raise his head. Seeing the king’s handsome countenance, he was greatly pleased and immediately enfeoffed him as the Golden Portal Transformed-Body Demon-Quelling Heavenly Worthy. He established for him the Nine Heavens’ Soft-Palace Mansion, entrusting him with governance of that celestial palace and command over thirty-six heavenly generals. He bestowed upon him a black dragon robe, a Seven-Star Sword, and a Seven-Treasures Crown. The king was granted the honor of sharing the Emperor’s seat, walking beside him, and accompanying him in all things. The king expressed his gratitude.\n\nThe Jade Emperor then held a grand feast in celebration. The court dispersed, and this is not further recounted.\n\nThe following day, the Emperor went to the Palace of the Sun. Deng Hua came forth to receive his ancestral master. The Emperor, seeing not a single one of the thirty-six heavenly generals, asked Deng Hua, “I have enfeoffed you here to command the thirty-six heavenly generals. Why do I see not one?”\n\nDeng Hua reported, “Originally, this post was held by one of Your Majesty’s transformed souls. But his heart grew greedy, and he fell to the mortal realm. With no one to command them, the heavenly generals all descended to the world below.”\n\nThe ancestral master said, “Since this is so, I shall address the matter with the Emperor tomorrow.”\n\nThis is not further recounted.\n\nThe next day at dawn, the Jade Emperor ascended the throne. The ancestral master memorialized, “By Your Majesty’s decree, I was sent to the Palace of the Sun to command the thirty-six heavenly generals. But as there was no master to oversee them, they have all fled to the mortal realm. I beg Your Majesty to decide how to proceed.”\n\nThe Jade Emperor, upon hearing this, asked his assembled ministers, “The ancestral master has memorialized thus. What should be done?”\n\nThe ministers replied, “Since the Palace of the Sun is under the ancestral master’s command, if the heavenly generals have fled to the mortal realm, it would be best to send him to retrieve them and return them to the celestial courts.”\n\nThe Emperor assented and ordered the ancestral master to descend to the mortal realm to gather the heavenly generals. The ancestral master, expressing his gratitude, left the court, his heart heavy with worry. Unsure of the whereabouts of the heavenly generals, he thought it best to seek his master, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy, and inquire of the matter. Resolving this, he entered the Tushita Palace.\n\nThe Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy was seated in meditation upon the dharma platform. The ancestral master approached and made a reverent gesture. The Heavenly Worthy asked, “Disciple, why have you come?”\n\nThe ancestral master replied, “It is for no other reason. By Your Majesty’s decree, I was sent to the Palace of the Sun to command the thirty-six heavenly generals. But when I arrived, not one remained. I reported this to the Jade Emperor, who asked his ministers. The ministers advised that I should retrieve them myself. Yet, descending to the mortal realm, I know not their whereabouts. Thus, I have come humbly to seek your guidance, Master.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said, “Had I not told you, you would not have known. You still have forty-two years of tribulation left unfulfilled, which is why this has come to pass. The heavenly generals cannot be retrieved this time; they must instead be reborn into the mortal realm, endure all manner of suffering, and only then may they enter the Realm of Ultimate Bliss.”\n\nThe ancestral master asked, “Where shall I be reborn?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied, “At present, the king of the Pure Luo Kingdom has no heir. His consort, the virtuous Empress Shansheng, burns incense at night and prays to Heaven for a son. You shall transform into a ray of golden light and enter the empress’s womb. In time, when you have grown and your cultivation is complete, you may then ascend to the celestial courts to enjoy your due.”\n\nThe ancestral master, having heard this, could only bow in farewell. He transformed into a ray of golden light, drifting and floating as he flew toward the Pure Luo Kingdom. Empress Shansheng was burning incense in the imperial gardens when she suddenly fell asleep. That ray of golden light entered her womb. The empress dreamed she swallowed a red sun, and from that moment, she conceived.\n\nUnaware, ten months passed. In the twenty-fifth year of the Kaihuang era, on the third day of the third month at noon, the empress of the Pure Luo Kingdom gave birth to a crown prince. The prince emerged from her side, and the empress fainted, her breath stilled. The Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy intoned a spell and blew into the empress’s left side. Gradually, she revived, regaining her senses. The entire palace was enveloped in purple mist, and nine dragons spat foam to bathe the prince. In an instant, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy carried the dragons away through the sky, and the palace returned to its former state. The palace ladies rushed to inform the king.\n\nOverjoyed, the king ordered the prince brought forth. Seeing his refined features and extraordinary bearing, the king was delighted and named him the Mysterious Origin Crown Prince. Unnoticed, spring turned to autumn, and time passed swiftly. The ancestral master, reborn in the Pure Luo Kingdom, was now fourteen years old.\n\nOne year, during the Lantern Festival, the king of the Pure Luo Kingdom ascended the throne. The crown prince came forth and petitioned his father, asking to go and view the lanterns. The king replied, “You are the heir apparent. You must not go out at night to see the lanterns.”",

One day, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy arrived and asked, “Disciple, do you understand the Dao?”\n\nThe king replied, “I do not.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy asked again, “Do you understand worldly affairs?”\n\nThe king again answered, “I do not.”\n\n“Do you understand life and death?”\n\n“I do not.”\n\n“Do you know you have a body?”\n\n“I do not.”",

      "translated_text": "The crown prince replied, “Let your child disguise as a commoner to go and see the lanterns, then return at once.” The king assented and ordered Commander Tang Bo, along with four eunuchs, to escort the crown prince from the palace to view the lanterns in the marketplace.\n\nAs the crown prince stepped beyond the palace gates, he had not gone the distance of an arrow’s flight before he beheld: resplendent lanterns hung high, flutes and pipes resounding to the heavens. Lovely maidens, fairer than celestial nymphs, drank and reveled with joyous abandon. The crown prince and Tang Bo turned onto South Street, where they saw several drunken men stumbling and reeling, senseless to the world. Turning onto North Street, they witnessed a pair of men brawling over a courtesan in Mengjie’s brothel, each vying for her favor. On East Street, they observed a thief who had stolen a man’s silver pouch, now being beaten mercilessly, his cries for heaven and earth going unheeded.\n\nHaving seen all this, the crown prince suddenly sighed aloud, “How might one escape the four snares of wine, lust, wealth, and wrath? Then why should I be a ruler?” At that moment, the Dipper Mother Heavenly Worthy, who had descended to the mortal realm during the Lantern Festival in the guise of a Daoist to observe the hearts of men, heard the prince’s words. Stepping forward, she bowed and replied, “This poor Daoist just overheard the gentleman say he wished to be free of the four snares of wine, lust, wealth, and wrath. Might you be seeking the method to achieve this? I possess it.”\n\nThe crown prince asked, “How might one be freed from them?” The Daoist replied, “This poor Daoist has abandoned parents, parted from wife and children, and lives by following the currents of fate—is this not freedom?” Before he had finished speaking, Commander Tang Bo, seeing the Daoist’s words urging the crown prince thus, gnashed his teeth and prepared to strike him down. The Daoist, perceiving this, mounted a cloud of auspicious vapor and soared halfway into the sky, revealing his true form. He declared, “The Dao has no root; one must seek it for oneself. If you cling to wealth and nobility, you risk obscuring your true spirit. I am none other than the Dipper Mother Heavenly Worthy.”\n\nUpon seeing this, the crown prince bowed toward the heavens and said, “This disciple is willing to abandon the throne and leave the world.” The Daoist replied, “I depart now. If you do not advance, there will be no place for you in the celestial palace.” The crown prince, greatly startled, returned to the palace with Tang Bo.\n\nAt dawn the next day, the king ascended the throne. The crown prince came forth and reported his encounter with the Daoist, expressing his desire to cultivate the Dao. The king said, “Nowadays, the world is full of demons and heresies. How could celestial immortals descend to deliver mortals? My son, do not be deluded. Would you forsake the nobility of the throne to pursue such fanciful matters? I shall not grant your request.”\n\nThe crown prince petitioned again, “Tales of immortals have long existed, and the practice of cultivation has been passed down since ancient times. How can one dismiss true words and obscure the right path? If one day I should suddenly depart this life, impermanence comes swiftly—how then could I amend past errors? I beg you, Father, to permit me to leave the palace and cultivate the Dao. If one day I achieve success, the nine clans may ascend together.”\n\nSeeing the crown prince’s unwavering resolve to leave the world and cultivate, the king grew furious. He ordered the imperial guard Zheng Cai to imprison the prince in the Cold Palace to suffer hardship, hoping he would change his mind before being pardoned. Zheng Cai immediately confined the prince in the Cold Palace, and the king retired from court.\n\nOnce inside the Cold Palace, the crown prince reflected and sighed, “If there were no yin and yang, how could there be day and night? If there were no heaven, how could there be hell? What I saw the other night—if it were false, there would be no heart urging me to cultivate. There must be some deeper meaning.”",

Before his prayer was finished, Yuanjun called from the clouds above, “Crown Prince, now that your father has imprisoned you here, I fear there is little chance of escape. It would be better to obey your father’s command, abandon cultivation, and devise a way to free yourself.”\n\nThe prince replied, “Since I was fortunate enough to meet you, Master, my heart has never wavered.

      "translated_text": "The mountains encircle in hues finer than jade, truly a divine creation of immortals.\n\nNow, the prince and Yuanjun arrived at the mountain. The prince bowed to Yuanjun as his master, and from dawn to dusk, they expounded sutras and preached the Dharma, sitting in meditation and cultivation—this shall not be further recounted.\n\nThe narrative now turns to another thread. The following day, the king ascended the throne, and the captain Zheng Cai memorialized, “The prince has vanished.” The king flew into a rage, executed Zheng Cai, and was deeply distressed. His ministers—Zhao Quan, Sun Yue, Feng Yuan, Wang Long, and Wang Rong—stepped forward and petitioned, “If Your Majesty wishes to retrieve the prince, let proclamations be issued and posted throughout the realm. Whoever knows the prince’s whereabouts shall report it and be rewarded with a thousand taels of gold. Whoever harbors the prince shall be granted an official title.” The king approved the memorial and immediately issued the proclamations, posting them along the roads in every direction.\n\nThen, a woodcutter named Chen Chun, who lived at the foot of Wudang Mountain, recalled having seen a man accompanied by a Daoist entering the mountain some days prior. Hearing of the missing prince and the royal proclamation, he surmised that the man he had seen must be the prince. He tore down the proclamation and went to inform the king.\n\nWhat transpired thereafter shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n**The Prince Wears a Yin-Yang Topknot**\n\nOne day, the king ascended the throne and was informed, “Chen Chun, the woodcutter from Wudang Mountain, has seen the prince and comes bearing the proclamation to see Your Majesty.” The king ordered him brought in. After the customary salutations, the king asked, “Since you have torn down the proclamation to see me, have you indeed seen the prince?” Chen Chun replied, “Your subject recently saw a man accompanied by a Daoist entering Wudang Mountain. I believed it to be the prince and have come to report to Your Majesty.” The king said, “Since you saw the two enter the mountain, you shall lead the way. I now command Marshal Tang Bo and Captain Huang Zhong, along with five hundred armored soldiers, to accompany you as guide. Go to Wudang Mountain, find the prince, and return. You shall be richly rewarded upon your return.” Chen Chun expressed his gratitude and departed the court, setting out for Wudang Mountain with the marshal and his men.\n\nUpon entering the mountain, they saw the prince sitting solemnly beneath a cliff, his hair bound in a yin-yang topknot. The soldiers stepped forward and hailed him, but the prince did not utter a word, sitting in silence. Tang Bo ordered the armored soldiers to seize the prince and bring him back to court. In an instant, the sky darkened, and a fierce wind arose, hurling sand and stones from the north. Faces could no longer be discerned, and the debris rained down in chaos. The armored soldiers, along with Tang Bo and the others, covered their heads and ears in terror, fleeing back to the court.\n\nThe next day, the king ascended the throne, and Tang Bo, Chen Chun, and Huang Zhong entered to pay their respects. The king asked, “Did you go to Wudang Mountain and see the prince?” Tang Bo memorialized, “Your servant arrived at Wudang and indeed saw the prince sitting beneath the cliff. I ordered the armored soldiers to bring him back to court, but the prince did not respond. Suddenly, sand and stones flew toward us, and faces could not be seen. We had no choice but to return and report to Your Majesty.” The king, upon hearing this, said, “Since the prince is on Wudang Mountain, I shall once more appoint Chen Chun as guide. Let him accompany the civil and military officials, along with three thousand imperial guards, to escort the prince back to court.” The ministers expressed their gratitude and departed.\n\nThe following day, they assembled the officials, with Chen Chun as guide, and set out for Wudang Mountain. Upon arriving, they entered and saw the prince. After the customary salutations, the prince said, “You have come from afar, my lords. What message do you bring?” The ministers memorialized, “We have received the king’s decree to escort Your Highness back to court.” The prince replied, “Before leaving the kingdom, it was possible, but now, who among those who admire the Dao would dare abandon the Buddha’s teachings to return to the secular world? Heaven and earth are impartial. If even a single thought is impure, does one not bring ruin upon oneself?” The ministers memorialized, “We have heard that when a son leaves home to cultivate the Dao, it is already a grievous act of filial impiety. Now, Your Highness remains resolute in not returning. The king is aged and has no other heir to ascend the throne, and he worries day and night. If misfortune should befall him, who will wear mourning and hold the staff? Who will succeed to the throne? How can Your Highness be certain that you will not be criticized by your ministers or become the subject of public gossip? In this way, Your Highness may not yet have achieved the Dao, but an ill reputation will have already taken shape. We are Your Highness’s loyal subjects and cannot conceal the truth or remain silent when we see it. We beg Your Highness to consider carefully.” Hearing the ministers’ words, the prince could not help but shed tears and said, “I have long known that my father has no son to succeed him. I once asked my master, who said that this year, my father would have a son to inherit the throne. Return and report to my father that he need not worry. You may all return to court. But since I have left the secular world, how can there be any reason for me to return? As ministers and sons, you strive to be loyal but cannot fully fulfill filial piety. How much less can one who has left the world attend to the toils of their parents? If heaven grants our wishes, one day, when I attain the Dao, my parents will both become Buddhas. If not, all is determined by heaven, and I cannot prevent the criticism. Do not speak further. Return to court swiftly, fulfill your duties as loyal ministers, and assist the ruler. If, in the future, my mother bears a younger brother who comes of age to inherit the throne, he will rely on your counsel.”",

They left the Cold Palace and arrived at Wudang Mountain. Behold:\n\nGreen peaks rise, their cliffs sheer,\nWillows sway, rare blossoms drift in the breeze.",

      "translated_text": "The ministers, seeing that the Crown Prince would not be swayed and was determined to leave the secular world, could only bow in farewell and return to court. What became of him later? This will be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\n**The Crown Prince Teased on Mount Wudang**\n\nNow, the King of Jingluo ascended the throne, and his ministers returned to court. Prostrating before the golden steps, they reported, “We journeyed to Mount Wudang and saw the Crown Prince. Though we spoke at length to persuade him, his resolve was firm as the wind passing unheard. He would not return. Seeing his unwavering intent, we informed him of Your Majesty’s lack of an heir. The Crown Prince replied that he had heard from his master that the Queen was with child and would bear a son this year to inherit the throne. Thus, we returned to report to Your Majesty.”\n\nThe King sighed upon hearing this. “If he is so steadfast in his refusal, we cannot press further. As for the claim that the Queen will bear another son, we cannot yet take it as certain. This is no fault of yours.” He then rewarded the woodcutter who had delivered the news by appointing him as a patrol officer, bestowed a catty of silver upon each minister, and granted them three days’ leave from court. The assembled officials expressed their gratitude and withdrew.\n\nTime passed swiftly, and as spring gave way to autumn, the Queen of Jingluo indeed bore another prince. The King rejoiced and named him Xuanxu. In time, he grew to become the King of Jingluo.\n\n---\n\nMeanwhile, the Master, having taken leave of the court officials, returned to the mountain to cultivate in seclusion, where he remained for twenty years. Behind Mount Wudang dwelled the Mountain Saintess, who one day mused to herself, “By the Celestial Worthy’s decree, I was tasked to dwell in the mountain’s rear, secretly accompanying the Master in his cultivation and observing his conduct. Yet from the day he entered the mountain until now—twenty years have passed—he has not once broken a precept, and his merit has grown vast. Tonight, I shall transform into a beautiful woman and go to test him. If his heart stirs with desire and he consorts with me, then with my boundless divine powers, I may roam the world at will—would that not be splendid?”\n\nWith this thought, she recited a true incantation and, with a shake of her body, transformed into a woman—so fair she seemed a reincarnation of Xi Shi, or Guanyin descending from the mountain. Her golden lotuses, three inches bound, trod lightly as she swayed gracefully before the Master’s meditation platform. Feigning sorrowful weeping, she cried, “Master, for heaven’s sake, save this maid!”\n\nThe Master was seated in meditation when the sound of weeping drew near. Startled, he looked up to see a woman and asked in alarm, “Young lady, why have you come here? Night falls—you must leave at once.”\n\nThe woman replied, “My mother is ill, and I was returning home to see her when I lost my way and came here. By good fortune, I have met you, Master. Pray show mercy and allow me to stay the night. Tomorrow, I shall find my way home.”\n\nThe Master said, “This is a place of cultivation. There is only a meditation bed beneath the cliff—how could it accommodate a guest? Moreover, you are a woman, and as the saying goes, ‘Men and women should not touch in passing.’ The hour is not yet late—hasten from this place and seek lodging at the foot of the mountain. Tomorrow, you may return home. Would that not be best?”\n\nThe woman said, “I am but a woman. If I seek lodging elsewhere, it would be improper. Besides, I suffer from a chronic ailment—when I catch a chill, my stomach aches. Today, the weather is cold, and though this place is no proper lodging, I beg you, Master, to show mercy. Loosen your sash and hold me in your arms. If my old illness does not flare tonight, I shall be forever grateful for your kindness.”\n\nThe Master exclaimed, “Amitābha! What words are these? I have cultivated for twenty years. Not only have I not drawn near women, but I have not even shared a bed with men. I cannot comply with your request.”\n\nSeeing that her teasing had no effect, the woman feigned a piteous cry, wailing, “The pain is unbearable! Master, save me!”\n\nThe Master pretended not to hear. The woman called again, “Master, a monastic should save those in disaster and aid those in peril. Why is your heart so hard as iron?”\n\nAfter enduring her pleas for some time, the Master, moved by her pitiful cries, asked, “What remedy have you used in the past for your stomach pain?”\n\nThe woman replied, “When the pain is slight, my husband’s hand pressing upon it brings relief. When the pain is severe, I must press my belly to his for a time before it subsides. Now, the pain has struck, and my husband is not here. No one can press upon it for me. I beg you, Master, press upon it for me. If I may but see my mother again, I shall repay you with my life.”\n\nThe Master said, “I am a monastic. How can I touch a young woman’s body? This is impossible.”\n\nThe woman cried out again, “Master, as the saying goes, ‘Saving a life is greater than building a seven-story pagoda.’ If you do not press upon it soon, I shall surely die of pain!”\n\nSeeing her distress, the Master relented and stepped forward, pressing upon her for a moment. The woman cried out again, “The pain is severe—pressing does not stop it. As they say, ‘Save a life to the end.’ I beg you, Master, loosen your sash and press against me for a while. The pain will then cease.”\n\nThe Master replied, “If that is the case, I would sooner die than comply.” He strode out beneath the moonlight and sighed, “I left my kingdom and cultivated for over twenty years, yet instead of encountering the Dao, I am entangled by others. This is no path to enlightenment. I should descend the mountain and seek another way.”",

      "translated_text": "Having spoken thus, he paid the woman no further heed and departed, stepping down the mountain. Seeing the Master storm off in anger, the woman cried out in alarm, “I have committed a grave sin! This man has cultivated for over twenty years, and the celestial scriptures were soon to be bestowed upon him. Now I have trifled with him—if he leaves, all his past efforts will be undone. Should the Venerable Miaole of the Heavens learn of this, how shall I answer? I had better transform into an old woman and intercept him on the path to turn him back, thereby atoning for my transgression.”\n\nWith these words, she recited a true incantation, assuming the form of an old woman. She turned a rotting log into an iron pestle and, riding the clouds, hastened ahead to a spot on the path. There, she ground the pestle back and forth upon a stone. The Master, descending the mountain in fury, had just begun his journey when he saw the old woman grinding the iron pestle on the rock. He halted, pondering what use it could serve. Drawing near, he asked, “Venerable elder, I see you grinding this iron pestle here—what purpose does it serve?”\n\nThe old woman replied, “My granddaughter asked me for a sewing needle, but we have none at home. So I am grinding this iron pestle into a needle for her use.”\n\nThe Master laughed upon hearing this. “How many days will it take for an iron pestle to become a needle? Do not waste your energy.”\n\nThe old woman said, “I know it is difficult, but since I have already promised my granddaughter, how can I abandon the task halfway? With patience, it will surely be accomplished one day.”\n\nThe Master, hearing this, asked no further questions and continued on his way. Seeing that this attempt had failed to turn him back, the Celestial Mother transformed again, this time into an old man. Riding the clouds, she alighted three *li* ahead, where she took up an iron hammer in one hand and an awl in the other, boring into the rock by the path. When the Master arrived, he saw the old man drilling the rock and, not understanding his intent, approached and asked, “Elder, why are you boring into this rock with an awl?”\n\nThe old man replied, “I am too old to till several *mu* of dry fields, and there is no water to irrigate them. So I am boring a channel through this rock to bring water to the fields.”\n\nThe Master laughed and asked, “When will this be accomplished?”\n\nThe old man said, “As the saying goes, ‘With perseverance, even stone can be pierced.’ How can it not be done? I have been laboring at this for over a month. If I were to abandon it because of your words, would I not waste all my previous efforts? I shall not heed your remark but will redouble my diligence. One day, it will surely be accomplished. How could I give up halfway and forsake my past labors?”\n\nThe Master stood in contemplation for a long while. He mused to himself, “Since descending the mountain, I have witnessed two things—grinding a pestle and boring a rock—both arduous tasks. Yet neither would abandon their efforts because of a single word. I am a monastic, yet I fled in anger over a woman, casting aside my past cultivation. It would be better to return to the mountain and resume my practice, to see what may come of it.”\n\nHaving resolved this, he turned back and returned to the mountain to continue his cultivation. The Celestial Mother of the mountain, seeing that the Master’s heart had returned, was overjoyed. She resumed her true form and once more concealed herself behind the mountain, whereupon no more is said of her.\n\nNow, the Venerable Miaole, observing from the clouds that the Master’s merit was complete and he was gradually entering the Dao, saw that he had yet to refine the viscera within his five organs. The Heavenly Venerable displayed his divine power, reciting an incantation. From the void, he summoned two sleep-inducing insects, which flew toward the Master and alighted upon him. Instantly, the Master fell into a deep slumber, oblivious to all.\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable then summoned the Belly-Slicing Spirit and handed him a sacred sword, instructing him to open the Master’s abdomen. The Belly-Slicing Spirit received the command, untied the Master’s sash, and split open his chest. He removed the intestines and placed them beneath a rock, covering them with a stone. Then, taking a strip of the Master’s robe, he fashioned it into a stomach, and a length of his sash into intestines, sewing them into place. The Heavenly Venerable then took out a pill of returning spirit and placed it in the Master’s mouth, ordering the Belly-Slicing Spirit to withdraw.\n\nReciting a true incantation, the Heavenly Venerable revived the Master in an instant. The Master awoke to find the Heavenly Venerable beside him. He promptly rose and bowed, saying, “This disciple has erred in failing to greet you from afar.”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said, “I instructed you not to sleep at night—why have you fallen asleep in broad daylight?”\n\nThe Master replied, “In the past, I felt my mind serene and did not sleep day or night. I do not know why today I suddenly grew so weary and fell into a slumber from which I could not awaken.”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said, “You must not do so again.”\n\nThe Master replied, “From now on, I shall reform.”\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said, “Cultivate for a few more years, and you will surely attain the immortal rank. I bestow upon you this sacred sword—keep it with you always. Should you encounter evil demons, wield it and they shall depart.”\n\nThe Master bowed in gratitude, and the Heavenly Venerable rode away upon the clouds.\n\nUnaware that his viscera had been replaced by the Heavenly Venerable, the Master continued his arduous cultivation day and night, sitting in meditation. Gradually, he felt his body grow lighter, and a five-colored cloud often enveloped him. Beasts from all directions came to pay homage, and day and night, he heard the sutras and the Dharma.\n\nOn this mountain, there was a child who was in truth a bamboo spirit. Since the Master had arrived to cultivate here, the spirit had listened to the Dharma morning and evening and had gained a modicum of divine power. One day, it transformed into a woman, approaching from the western path, weeping bitterly. Drawing near, she cried out to the Master, “Save me, Master!”\n\nThe Master asked, “Young lady, why have you come here?”\n\nThe woman replied, “My husband is forcing me to remarry, but I refused to comply. So I fled through the back gate, intending to return to my parents’ home.”",

      "translated_text": "The woman wept bitterly before the meditation platform, pleading again and again. The Master remained unmoved, sitting with downcast eyes. From noon until dusk, she wailed without cease. As the sky darkened, she said, \"Master, since you refuse to descend, I have lingered here too long. Night has fallen, and I cannot return home. What am I to do?\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"Young lady, you may still make haste and return.\"\n\nThe woman said, \"Master, you are steadfast in your refusal, and I dare not persist. But the main road below the mountain is one I can traverse alone—yet the mountain paths have left me lost. I beg you to guide me out, and I shall return on my own.\"\n\nHearing this, the Master had no choice but to rise from the platform. Taking up his sword, he led the woman down the mountain. Halfway there, she seized his shoulders from behind and said, \"My feet ache with pain. I beg you to support me for a few steps.\"\n\nThe Master was startled and replied, \"This poor monk has lived forty years in seclusion, never touching another. How could I support you? Walk slowly instead.\"\n\nThe woman said, \"Master, your words are just. But my feet truly cannot carry me. If you refuse to help me down, then let us return to the mountain and spend the night at the meditation platform. Tomorrow, I shall go home alone.\"\n\nThe Master could not comply with either request. The woman then said, \"You refuse to help me down, and you refuse to return with me. Master, I see you are no ordinary man—your bearing is noble, your features refined. My heart stirs with desire. I beg you to satisfy my longing for this moment, and then I shall return home. What say you?\"\n\nThe Master made no reply, turning to leave. The woman revealed her divine power, rushing forward to seize him. With a spell of binding, she said, \"I have humbled myself before you, like a falling flower with intent. Why do you remain as heartless as flowing water?\"\n\nThe Master, ensnared by her, felt his body grow heavy, unable to break free. Suddenly, he remembered the sword at his waist. Drawing it forth, the woman vanished, and his spirit returned to clarity. He returned to the meditation platform without further mention.\n\nNow, the Venerable Miaole observed from the clouds how the Master’s heart remained unmoved, his integrity unshaken. One day, as the Jade Emperor ascended his throne, the Venerable Miaole presented a memorial: \"Your Majesty, a fragment of your soul has completed its cultivation, free from even the slightest worldly thought. You should swiftly dispatch divine generals to escort him to the celestial courts and grant him rank and office.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor, overjoyed, commanded the Azure Dragon of the East, the Vermilion Dragon of the South, the White Dragon of the West, the Black Dragon of the North, and the Yellow Dragon of the Center to bear the Venerable Miaole’s carriage. He further ordered the Great White Star of the West to present a seal inscribed with the four characters *Master of the Jade Void*. The Banner-General Shigu was tasked with holding a flag to descend and welcome the Master.\n\nThe courtiers received their orders and departed.\n\nOne day, as the Master combed his hair upon a cliff, he suddenly reflected on his mortal form’s futility. His resolve faltered, and he ceased grooming, tossing the comb aside. After a long sigh, he gazed down at the sheer drop—over ten *zhang* deep. Just then, a celestial decree arrived, and the five dragons lifted him aloft. The Master, seeing the edict, knelt to receive it.\n\nThe decree read: \"As the ancient saying goes, *Heaven fulfills the good intentions of men.* Reward follows good and evil, for the cosmos is impartial. We have witnessed Yuanxuan’s forty years of ascetic practice, untouched by even the faintest worldly thought. His sincerity is evident, and he is fit for a celestial rank. We now dispatch the five dragons to bear him, the Golden Star to hold his seal, and Shigu to carry his banner. We appoint him as the *Master of the Five Voids, Mysterious Heavenly Emperor of the North*, overseeing thirty-six celestial generals and eighty-two transformations. On the ninth day of the ninth month and the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month each year, he shall traverse the mortal realm to inspect good and evil. His original abode shall be the Palace of the Sun, with a stipend of a thousand measures of grain. He shall enter the Western Heaven to receive the precepts and ascend with his nine clans.\"\n\nThe Master, having heard the decree, kowtowed in gratitude. Turning to groom himself, he found his hair would not stay bound. Startled, the Venerable Miaole said, \"Disciple, I did not foresee this. Once the celestial edict arrived, your mortal form could no longer be altered. How could you comb it again?\"\n\nThe Master bowed in thanks. The Venerable Miaole then ascended to Heaven upon a cloud.\n\nAt dawn the next day, the Jade Emperor held court. The Venerable Miaole presented the Master before him. The Emperor asked, \"Who is this?\"\n\nThe Venerable replied, \"This is Yuanxuan, whom I was commanded to bring from Mount Wudang to see Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor, delighted, descended from his throne to raise the Master, inviting him to sit upon a brocade cushion. A grand imperial banquet was held to honor the assembled ministers. A decree was issued to escort the Master to the Palace of the Sun.\n\nThe following day, the Master ascended his seat in the Palace of the Sun. The gatekeepers announced the arrival of the assembled Venerables to offer congratulations. The Master received them, and as they conversed, a sudden surge of resentment from the north pierced the heavens. The Master was alarmed and asked the celestial lords, \"I have only just arrived in this celestial realm. Why does this unceasing resentment rise from the north?\"\n\nThe celestial lords replied, \"Your Majesty is unaware—this is the resentment of the mortal realm. Emperor Sui Tang rules with tyranny, deluded and murderous. Thus, this miasma lingers.\"\n\nBefore they could finish, demonic vapors surged from all four directions.",

      "translated_text": "The Master then asked, \"And now demonic vapors arise—what is the cause?\" The celestial lords replied, \"These demonic vapors are the emanations of the Heavenly Emperor’s generals, who have incited chaos across the four quarters of the mortal realm. Hence, these vapors arise.\"\n\nThe Master said, \"That both demonic and resentful qi surge toward the heavens is no auspicious sign. It cannot be tolerated long—what should be done?\" The celestial lords answered, \"If one possessed of divine power were to descend to the mortal realm and eradicate these two qi, the merit would be immeasurable, and the Three Realms would know peace.\"\n\nThe Master said, \"Since these demonic vapors stem from my own generals, how could I hesitate to act? Tomorrow, I shall seek an audience with the Heavenly Emperor and descend to the mortal realm to purge these two qi. Would this not be fitting?\" The celestial lords rejoiced and, taking their leave, returned to their grottoes.\n\nThe following day, the Jade Emperor ascended his throne. The Master stepped forward from the ranks, his court boots striking the ground, his ivory tablet held before his chest. He memorialized, \"Yesterday, upon arriving at the Palace of the Sun, I beheld demonic and resentful qi surging from the mortal realm. Such omens are inauspicious for the celestial realm and must be eradicated. I have heard that these demonic vapors arise from my own generals, who have sown chaos across the four quarters of the mortal realm. I volunteer to descend and recall my generals, expel the perverse, and destroy the demonic, returning thereafter to present myself before Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe Five Emperors, upon hearing this, were greatly pleased. They bestowed upon him the Three Terraces Seven Stars Sword, a suit of golden chainmail, five hundred Fire Elixir pellets, and appointed him as the Great General Zhenwu of the Northern Direction. Three cups of imperial wine were offered, and the Master, having expressed his gratitude, departed the court.\n\nThe Master left the celestial realm and went to the Three Clarities Abbey to take leave of the Three Clarities. After exchanging greetings, the Three Clarities inquired as to his purpose. The Master recounted his audience with the Jade Emperor and his intent to descend to the mortal realm to subdue the demons. The Three Clarities asked, \"Who will accompany you?\" The Master replied, \"I shall go alone, for I have no deputy. I have come to seek your counsel—how should I proceed?\"\n\nThe Three Clarities said, \"This is not difficult. During your cultivation on Mount Wudang, you once discarded your entrails beneath a cliff. Over time, infused with spiritual qi, your belly became a turtle demon and your intestines a snake demon, both of which now wreak havoc in the mortal realm. If you descend, retrieve these two creatures to serve as your generals, and you will surely succeed.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the Master bowed in farewell and rode the clouds down the mountain. Reciting an incantation, he transformed into a Daoist priest. What transpired thereafter will be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\n**The Master Descends to Subdue the Two Demons**\n\nNow, the turtle and snake demons were one day admiring themselves in the Cave of Water and Fire. The snake said, \"Brother, we were born beneath the cliffs of Mount Wudang, and for years, we have grown in might. Today, our divine powers are vast, and our transformations boundless. Yet, we lack a lady to share our joy, and this displeases me greatly.\"\n\nThe turtle demon replied, \"Wise brother, you speak truly. Let us command the lesser demons to scour the households for beautiful women, and we shall take two for our pleasure.\" Delighted, the two immediately dispatched the lesser demons to investigate.\n\nNow, Prefect Lin Biao of Caozhou had a daughter, Miss Jinju, aged eighteen, in the bloom of youth, with rosy lips and white teeth, surpassingly beautiful. Similarly, Magistrate Zhao Mo had a daughter, aged sixteen, named Jiaoniang, whose bearing was enchanting, her brows and eyes exquisitely formed. One day, the two young ladies were admiring flowers in the garden when the lesser demons spied them. They hastened back to report to the two demons, who immediately rode their demonic clouds to the scene.\n\nIndeed, the two maidens were playing in the rear garden, their beauty beyond compare. Overjoyed, the demons displayed their powers, reciting incantations that summoned a fierce wind. The gale was so violent that faces could not be seen, and all the maidservants were blown to the ground. The two young ladies, clutching each other, attempted to flee the garden, but the demons each seized one and carried them away upon the clouds. In an instant, the wind stilled, the mist dispersed, and the maidservants, finding their mistresses gone, were struck with terror. They rushed to inform the prefect and magistrate.\n\nThe",

Perhaps then they may relent; otherwise, it will be impossible.\"\n\nThe City God followed this advice and immediately mustered his divine soldiers, surrounding the cave entrance of Mount Wudang with battle cries shaking the heavens. The forces then split into two divisions.\n\nMeanwhile, the Turtle and Serpent Demons, having seized the two young ladies, returned in high spirits. They prepared a grand feast, intending to force the two maidens into marriage. Though the ladies refused even unto death, the Serpent Demon sought to devour them. The Turtle Demon said, \"Brother, do not be hasty. No wonder they resist—they are sheltered daughters, suddenly snatched away by us. Their tears have not yet dried; how could they willingly wed us? Command the lesser she-demons to attend them for a month or so, and their hearts will naturally turn. Why rush? Now that they are in our cave, where could they flee?\"\n\nThe Serpent Demon, greatly pleased, ordered the she-demons to serve them. As the two demons drank, battle cries erupted outside the cave. A lesser demon rushed in to report: \"The City God of this prefecture, having learned that the two great kings have seized the young ladies, has led divine troops here. He demands the immediate release of the two ladies, or else he will storm the cave and leave not even a blade of grass standing!\"\n\nEnraged, the Turtle and Serpent Demons roused their demonic troops and charged out of the cave, forming ranks. The two demons cursed, \"You are but a mortal official, rewarded with a post in the netherworld for your loyalty. We are born of heaven and earth, having achieved success through the Dharma. Our cave lacks mistresses, so we took the daughters of the prefect and magistrate—what concern is it of yours?

Born of calamity, you have brought misfortune upon the prefect and magistrate, whose petition reached my court. How could I not investigate? Release the two young ladies at once, and all will be forgiven. Refuse, and in but a moment, you will be dragged before the heavenly courts, where even your mouths will be silenced!\"\n\nThe two demons, hearing this, lunged forward with their spears. The City God met them with his blade. From noon till dusk, neither side gained the upper hand. Then the two demons displayed their powers: the Turtle transformed into a great mountain, while the Serpent coiled atop it, charging forward. The City God, unable to withstand the assault, fled in defeat. The two demons did not pursue but withdrew their forces into the cave.\n\nThe City God returned to his court, deeply troubled. The Local Deity of Wudang reported, \"My lord, do not despair. I have learned that the Dark Heavenly Emperor, ordered by the Jade Emperor to descend and purge demonic qi, has taken the form of a Daoist and now resides in the Three Clarities Temple. He must possess great power. My lord should seek his aid, and if he comes, these two demons will surely be subdued.\"\n\nThe City God, hearing this, immediately went to the Three Clarities Temple to see the Patriarch. The Patriarch asked, \"City God, why have you come?\" The City God replied, \"This humble official has been troubled by the two demons of the Water-Fire Cave on Mount Wudang, who have abducted the daughter of Prefect Lin Biao and the daughter of Magistrate Zhao Mo. A petition reached my court, and I led troops to retrieve them, but I was no match for them. Hearing that the Emperor has descended to eliminate demons, I have come to beseech his aid, to save the lives of the two young ladies and swiftly extend his compassion.\"\n\nThe Patriarch replied, \"Return now. I shall go to the Water-Fire Cave at once.\" The City God bowed in gratitude and departed.\n\nThe Patriarch recited true incantations, grasped his Seven-Star Sword, and rode the clouds straight to the Water-Fire Cave to do battle. A lesser demon reported to the two demons, who emerged from the cave. Behold the Patriarch’s appearance: in his hand, the Seven-Star Sword; upon his body, a golden-yellow armor and brocade robe; his brows clear, his eyes bright, his form radiant with golden light.

By the Jade Emperor’s decree, I have come to subdue demons. Surrender at once to avoid heavenly execution!\"\n\nThe two demons replied, \"You belong to the upper realms, while we dwell in the mortal world. What grudge do we bear against you that you seek us out?\"\n\nThe Patriarch said, \"The heavenly law states: 'Demons who bewitch and abduct the daughters of good families, devouring human flesh and blood, shall be cast into Fengdu for five hundred years before they may become beasts again.' If you do not reflect upon yourselves, how dare you still act so insolently?\"\n\nHearing this, the two demons flew into a rage and charged forward with their spears. The Patriarch pointed his sword, summoning the fire of Bing and Ding. The Turtle, being of water, fled at the sight of true fire; the Serpent, a fire star, feared it not and pressed forward with even greater vigor. The Patriarch then pointed his sword toward the north, summoning the water of Ren and Gui. The Serpent, seeing the true water arrive, could not withstand it and fled.\n\nSeeing the two demons retreat, the Patriarch stormed into the cave, where he found the two young ladies weeping bitterly. He asked the reason, and the two girls recounted how they had been admiring flowers when they were seized. The Patriarch said, \"Young ladies, do not weep.

      "translated_text": "The magistrate recounted to the judicial commissioner how his daughter had been rescued by the True Martial General. The commissioner said, \"Your daughter’s account matches word for word what my own daughter told me. Now that we have been saved by a heavenly deity, we ought to build a temple in gratitude.\"\n\nThe magistrate replied, \"Your Excellency speaks rightly.\" He then ordered Xu Dexun to gather laborers and materials to construct a temple outside the northern gate, with three halls and five beams. A statue was sculpted of the deity—hair unbound, sword in hand. The magistrate, the commissioner, their daughters, and their households all went to offer incense and give thanks. From then on, those who prayed there found their pleas answered without fail, and the temple’s incense has never ceased burning.\n\nMeanwhile, the two demons, driven away by the Patriarch, had nowhere to take refuge and seethed with resentment. The Serpent Demon said, \"We are starving and have no shelter. Brother, why not transform yourself into a ferryboat and me into a bamboo pole? We can wait at Sanli Creek for travelers to cross. When we reach midstream, we’ll sink the boat and devour them—both a meal and a refuge. What could be better?\" Delighted, the Turtle Demon transformed into a ferryboat and the Serpent into a pole, and they waited.\n\nThe Patriarch, having escorted the two young ladies home, returned to pursue the demons. Riding the clouds, he saw them disguised as a ferry and pole. A faint, cold smile crossed his lips. He halted his cloud, descended, and transformed into a Daoist priest. Stepping aboard, he seized the pole and slowly poled to midstream. The Turtle Demon rejoiced, preparing to display his power and sink the boat. But the Patriarch, seeing this, uttered a true incantation and brandished his Three Terraces Seven-Star Sword, his body swelling to ten thousand *zhang*. The Serpent, now the pole in his grasp, panicked and leapt into the water. The Turtle Demon reverted to his true form and tried to drag the Patriarch under. The Patriarch revealed his divine power—his head touched the Thirty-Three Heavens, his feet spanned the Five Lakes and Four Seas—pinning the Turtle and Serpent to the creek bed, leaving them no escape.\n\nSeeing this, the Serpent Demon soared into the air and cried, \"A celestial decree arrives!\" The Patriarch, hearing of the decree, reached out to receive it. The moment he did, the Turtle Demon slipped away. Realizing he had been tricked, the Patriarch was filled with regret, but the demon was already gone. He searched along the way but found no trace.\n\nThe two demons, having escaped, conferred and hid in an old well, waiting for someone to draw water so they could seize and devour them. The local earth god was alarmed and set out to report to the Sheji, but he encountered the Patriarch on the road. The earth god knelt to greet him. The Patriarch asked, \"Have you seen the whereabouts of the Turtle and Serpent Demons in this area?\" The earth god replied, \"The two demons are hiding in the well here, plotting to harm the villagers. I was just about to report to the Sheji.\" The Patriarch said, \"No need. Lead me to the well.\" The earth god guided him there.\n\nThe Patriarch drew his Three Terraces Seven-Star Sword, recited a true incantation, and pointed at the well. The two demons emerged and confronted him. The Patriarch pointed his sword south, then north—water and fire surged forth, and the demons fled in defeat. He pursued them, but they hid within a lotus root. Seeing this, he plucked the lotus and hacked it to pieces from stem to tip. The demons, trapped inside, panicked. They shrank themselves to the size of a millet grain, but the Patriarch pried one open—there they were. They leapt to the ground and fled. The Patriarch gave chase until he reached a pomegranate tree, where he saw them hiding among the fruit. He pointed his sword from south to north—water and fire erupted, shaking the branches and leaves, casting a crimson glow. The tree, roots and all, was engulfed, and the demons, fearing water and fire, could not escape. The Patriarch chanted an incantation, and the flames and waves intensified. The Turtle, afraid of fire, and the Serpent, afraid of water, could endure no more and cried out in misery.\n\nThe Patriarch asked, \"Will you surrender?\" The demons answered in unison, \"We willingly submit to the Heavenly Emperor.\" The Patriarch ceased the water and fire. The demons emerged and prostrated themselves before him. He asked, \"Do you truly submit?\" They replied, \"We will forever follow the Heavenly Emperor and dare not rebel.\" The Patriarch said, \"If you are sincere, reveal your true forms for me to see.\" At his command, the Serpent reverted to his original shape—golden scales, iron bones, and a single horn—while the Turtle’s back bore the Eight Trigrams of the Nine Palaces, with three eyes and three tails.\n\nSeeing their true forms, the Patriarch restrained them with his Seven-Star Sword and took out two Fire Elixirs, giving one to each. He instructed, \"You have just consumed my Fire Elixirs. If you ever rebel, call out ‘Fire,’ and you will perish instantly.\" The demons bowed in submission. The Patriarch took them to the celestial court and reported the events to the Jade Emperor. Delighted, the Jade Emperor appointed the Turtle and Serpent Demons as the Water and Fire Generals, to accompany the Patriarch in his divine work. After the Patriarch and the two demons expressed their gratitude, the Jade Emperor said, \"A dark *qi* still rises from the mortal realm. Who else remains?\"",

He commands seven generals: the first named Li Bian, the second Bai Qi, the third Liu Da, the fourth Zhang Yuanbo, the fifth Shen Shigui, the sixth Shi Wengong, and the seventh Fan Chenqing. The Malevolence Spirit himself is named Zhao Gongming, styled Wenming. Since departing the celestial realm for the mortal world, he has gone unrestrained, wreaking havoc day and night and tormenting the people. However, when he descended, he did not bring his magical treasures with him. Now, he and his seven generals have settled in Wind-Clear Cave in Xuzhou Prefecture, insatiably devouring humans. They often dispatch lesser demons to patrol the riverbanks, seizing and consuming any who attempt to cross. In West Peace Alley of Xuzhou Prefecture lives a man named Zhan Lisheng, who has long practiced virtue and accumulated merit. He travels as a merchant, and since your attainment of the Dao, he has sculpted your likeness and offered incense in your honor. Now, he must cross the river on urgent business, but Gongming has stationed one of his generals to patrol the waters. If Zhan Lisheng attempts the crossing, he will surely fall victim to their predation.

      "translated_text": "The Patriarch, having heard this, bowed his head in gratitude, departed from the Three Clarities Abbey, and instructed his Water and Fire Generals. With a shake of their forms, they transformed into three travelers, who hailed a boatman by the riverbank. From the mighty Yangtze, a solitary skiff drifted toward them. At its prow stood a boatman, bamboo pole in hand, guiding the vessel gently to shore. Suddenly, a gust of black qi surged forth, concealing seven figures who lunged forward to seize the Patriarch and his companions.\n\nAs the demonic qi drew near, the Patriarch revealed his divine power. Brandishing his Three Terraces Seven Stars Sword, with the Water General to his left and the Fire General to his right, he cut down the horde of demons, who fled in disarray, unable to withstand the onslaught. They scurried back into the Clear Wind Cave and reported all that had transpired. Upon hearing this, Zhao Gongming flew into a rage, donned his armor, and charged into battle. There he met the Patriarch, hurling curses without end.\n\nThe Patriarch said, “You are a celestial spirit of slaughter—why abandon your post to sow chaos in the mortal realm? You have violated the celestial statutes. Dismount now and surrender, and I shall escort you to the heavenly courts. All will be forgiven. Refuse, and your life shall be forfeit in but a moment.”\n\nEnraged, Zhao Gongming raised his iron mace and struck at the Patriarch, who met the blow with his sword. They clashed for over thirty rounds, neither gaining the upper hand. Zhao Gongming pondered for a moment, then secretly commanded his subordinate Li Bian to reveal his true form—a tiger-tailed whip with thirty-two segments, thirty-three *zhang* in length, light as a goose feather in the wielder’s hand yet crushing as Mount Tai to those struck. Displaying his divine prowess, he engaged the Patriarch in battle.\n\nUpon seeing this, the Patriarch ordered the Serpent Spirit to manifest its true form—a serpent thirty-two *zhang* long, coiling tightly around the whip, its weight like Mount Tai, nearly crushing Li Bian to death. Gasping for breath, Li Bian transformed back into his original shape and broke free from the serpent’s coils, fleeing in haste. The Patriarch pressed the attack, and Zhao Gongming, unable to resist, abandoned the cave and fled upon a propitious cloud.\n\nThe Patriarch stormed into the cave and instructed the Tortoise and Serpent Generals: “The fiend has been routed and will surely descend forty *li* away by cloud. You two must hasten there at once. Let the Serpent Spirit transform into a great mountain, and the Tortoise Spirit into a jujube. I shall turn this Seven Stars Sword into a temple called the Tongxian Abbey. I will disguise myself as a Daoist priest, reciting scriptures within. The fiend will inevitably come to the abbey for tea. Once he drinks, you shall roll into his belly—only then can we subdue him.”\n\nThe Tortoise and Serpent Generals received their orders and, together with the Patriarch, soared upon the clouds to a place called Ten Thousand Pines Grove, where they took their positions. The Patriarch transformed into a Daoist priest and began chanting scriptures within the abbey.\n\nZhao Gongming, defeated by the Patriarch, fled to the Clear Wind Cave but found no refuge. Ravenous with hunger, he spotted the abbey ahead, its scripture-chanting resonant. Entering, he was led into the hall by the priest. Overcome by hunger, he demanded, “Bring me food at once!”\n\nThe priest replied, “Where have you come from, honored guest? Our noon meal is finished, and the evening repast is not yet prepared. I can only offer you tea.”\n\n“Then bring me a cup of tea,” Zhao Gongming said, “and quickly prepare food after—I am starving.”\n\nThe Patriarch placed the Tortoise Spirit, transformed into a jujube, into the tea and offered it to Zhao Gongming, who swallowed it whole. As the jujube entered his belly, the Patriarch asked, “Zhao Gongming, do you recognize me?”\n\n“Who are you to know my name? I do not know you,” Zhao Gongming replied.\n\n“If you do not recognize me, then behold my true form.” The Patriarch turned and revealed his original appearance.\n\nAt the sight, Zhao Gongming attempted to flee, but the Patriarch commanded the Tortoise Spirit within him to seize his innards. Zhao Gongming cried out in agony, collapsing to the ground.\n\nThe Patriarch said, “The jujube you just ate was my general, the Tortoise Spirit in disguise. If you surrender to me, I shall give you two elixir pellets to expel him. Refuse, and you shall perish.”\n\nHearing this, Zhao Gongming pleaded for mercy, vowing to submit. The Patriarch handed him two Fire Elixirs to swallow, and the Tortoise Spirit emerged. Zhao Gongming bowed in submission, and the Patriarch rejoiced. Zhao Gongming then summoned his seven generals, who arrived in a subdued black qi, pledging their allegiance.\n\nWhat transpired thereafter shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Three: The Patriarch Faces the Golden Blade’s Peril**\n\nIt is told that the Black Tiger Spirit, a general under Zhao Gongming, seeing his master absent, transformed into a young maiden and descended to the mortal realm, concealing herself deep in the mountains. Often, she lurked by the roadside, feigning sorrowful weeping, devising countless schemes to ensnare and devour travelers. One day, she transformed into a maiden, wailing pitifully in the mud by the roadside, crying for help. When the Patriarch approached, she called out, “Save me! Save me!”\n\nThe Patriarch, accompanied by Zhao Gongming and the Water and Fire Generals, arrived to find the maiden mired in the mud, pleading for rescue. Sensing she was a demon, the Patriarch seized her with his right hand. Startled, the demoness fled in terror.",

      "translated_text": "The Patriarch pursued closely, brandishing his Seven-Star Sword to point at the demon, which then revealed its true form—a great tiger with black stripes. Upon seeing it, Gongming rushed forward and struck with his whip. Recognizing its master’s arrival, the tiger knelt to the ground and begged for mercy. Gongming led the tiger before the Patriarch, who rejoiced greatly.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jade Emperor ascended his throne as the Wondrous Music Heavenly Worthy presented his report, saying that the Patriarch had descended to the mortal realm and subdued Zhao the Killing Spirit and the Black Tiger. Delighted, the Jade Emperor commanded the Heavenly Worthy to descend with the imperial decree, bestowing upon Gongming the titles of Eminent Scholar of the Zhao Mansion, Grand Marshal of the Golden Wheel and Ruyi Enforcer, with a tiger-subduing rope in his left hand and an evil-averting whip in his right. Gongming expressed his gratitude.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy returned to the celestial courts, while the Patriarch, accompanied by Gongming and the Water and Fire Generals, set out once more to subdue the Black Qi. Now, this Black Qi was a sand-blade spirit born from Guan Yu’s saber, known as General Jinlie. It commanded three thousand blade soldiers, all capable of assuming human form, and dwelled in Mount Tiantai. Any who passed beneath the mountain were seized, hacked to mincemeat, and devoured.\n\nOne day, as the Patriarch patrolled the Black Qi and arrived at Mount Tiantai, the blade spirit transformed into a man—tall of body but short of leg, his entire form radiating golden light. Seeing the golden glow enveloping him, the Patriarch knew it was a demon. Drawing the Three Terraces Seven Furrows Sword from his waist, he struck. The blade spirit met the attack, and they fought over a hundred rounds without victory. The blade spirit displayed its divine power, and in an instant, flying blades filled the battlefield, gradually closing in. The Patriarch could not withstand the assault; flying blades pierced his body, and he fell dead upon the field.\n\nSeeing the Patriarch slain, the sand-blade spirit withdrew its troops and returned to Mount Tiantai.\n\nThe Water and Fire Generals and Zhao Gongming, witnessing the Patriarch’s death by blade, were filled with sorrow. The Water General said, “Brothers, our presence here is futile while we stand by helplessly. In my humble opinion, Brother Zhao should guard the Patriarch’s remains while my serpent brother and I ascend to the heavens to seek the Three Pure Ones and inquire how to revive him.”\n\nGongming replied, “Your plan is sound. I shall remain here while you two hasten to the heavens.” The Water and Fire Generals bid farewell to Gongming, mounted the clouds, and ascended directly to the Three Pure Ones’ abode. Prostrating before them, the Three Pure Ones inquired, “You two followed your master to the mortal realm to subdue the Black Qi. Why have you come here?”\n\nThe Tortoise and Serpent Spirits recounted the encounter with the blade spirit and its flying blades. Upon hearing this, the Three Pure Lords immediately issued a decree summoning the Wondrous Music Heavenly Worthy to their presence. After the Heavenly Worthy paid his respects, the Most High Lord Lao said, “Your disciple Xuanyuan descended to the mortal realm and encountered the sand-blade spirit, who slew him with flying blades. The Water and Fire Generals have come seeking aid. You must descend swiftly to revive your disciple and subdue the sand-blade spirit. If you delay beyond ten days, his body will dissolve into blood and water, never to be restored.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy assented and, accompanied by the Water and Fire Generals, took leave of the Three Pure Ones. Returning to his hall, he descended to the mortal realm and arrived at the Patriarch’s remains. Chanting true incantations, he gathered his inner spiritual qi and breathed it into the Patriarch’s mouth three times. Gradually, the Patriarch revived. Seeing his master, he turned and prostrated himself, thanking him for saving his life, and inquired about the blade spirit.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied, “This is no ordinary demon but a rogue magical treasure belonging to a disciple of the Venerable Master Pu’an.” The Patriarch asked, “Who is the Venerable Master Pu’an’s disciple?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy answered, “A man from the Three Kingdoms era, named Guan Yu, styled Yunchang.” The Patriarch said, “I have heard that Guan Yunchang was merely a loyal and valiant warrior of the Three Kingdoms. How did he come to be deified and enter the celestial courts?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied, “You are unaware. In the mortal realm, all loyal ministers, filial sons, and those of upright and selfless conduct are recorded in the earthly registers. When their allotted years end, they ascend to the heavens, where their merits are weighed and ranks bestowed, allowing them to enjoy the rewards of celestial emolument. Such cases are not rare.\n\nIn life, Guan Yu was a man of the Three Kingdoms, unwavering in loyalty and righteousness. Betrayed by Lü Meng’s treachery, he died without yielding, his spirit dispersing in the howling yin winds before coalescing in the clouds. One night, he encountered the Venerable Master Pu’an in meditation. At the utterance of a divine word, Guan Yu descended before the altar. The Dharma Master Pu’an then received him as a disciple and administered the precepts.\n\nOne day, as Pu’an attained the Dao, he ascended to the celestial courts. The Jade Emperor enfeoffed Guan Yu as the Loyal and Righteous Great General, tasked with guarding the Heavenly Gates by day and overseeing Fengdu by night. Later, when the Tathāgata expounded the Dharma in the Western Heaven, Guan Yu learned of the sufferings of samsara. Pleading illness to his lord, he secretly accompanied Zhou Cang and Guan Ping to the Western Heaven to hear the teachings, leaving his sand-blade behind at home.\n\nUnexpectedly, this unruly creature, seeing its master absent, descended to the mortal realm to wreak havoc. If you wish to subdue the sand-blade spirit, you must journey to the Western Heaven and summon Guan Yu himself, for only then can this object be reclaimed.”\n\nOverjoyed, the Patriarch bid farewell to his master and instructed Zhao Gongming and the Water and Fire Generals to remain on guard. Then, mounting a propitious cloud, he set forth toward the West to seek the Tathāgata. As the Tathāgata expounded the sutras and preached the Dharma in the Thunderclap Monastery, he saw a propitious cloud approaching. Turning to Guan Yu, he said, “The Supreme Emperor faces peril and has come to seek you.”",

      "translated_text": "Guan Yu said, “If I must go, then I shall go, but I have not yet completed my study of the Dharma—how can we meet again?”\n\nThe Tathāgata replied, “Though your study is not yet complete, if you remain here and take the Supreme Emperor as your master, you shall be spared from the toils of the mortal realm for life after life. You need not listen to sutras or receive teachings to escape the suffering of samsara.”\n\nGuan Yu, overjoyed at these words, thanked the Tathāgata. He instructed Guan Ping and Zhou Cang to return home, then turned and bowed to the Patriarch. The Patriarch was greatly pleased. Taking leave of the Tathāgata, he departed the Western Heaven with Guan Yu, descending upon clouds to meet the Water and Fire generals and Lord Gongming. All rejoiced.\n\nAt dawn the next day, Guan Yu raised a clamor before the Heavenly Terrace Mountain. The blade spirit, drinking wine in his cave, heard the uproar outside and grew furious. Donning his armor, he strode from the cave entrance. There stood Guan Yu, nine feet and three inches tall, his face like dark jujubes, clad in a green robe, seated upon his red hare steed, exuding a murderous aura. The blade spirit looked up, saw his former master, and his bones turned to jelly. Revealing his true form, he collapsed to the ground. Guan Yu stepped forward, seized him, and brought him before the Patriarch. The Patriarch was overjoyed and memorialized the Jade Emperor. An edict arrived from the Jade Emperor, appointing Guan Yu as **Lord Chongning, Daoist Perfected Sovereign of Resplendent Numinosity, Marshal of the Pass of Primordial Qi**, resuming his former duties: guarding the Heavenly Gate by day and overseeing Fengdu Hell by night, patrolling and inspecting all realms. In his left hand he held the **Golden Fierce Sand Blade**, in his right the **Purple Tenuity Edict Seal**; his left foot rested upon a **Thunder Spirit**, his right upon a **Fire Chariot**, aiding the Supreme Emperor in subduing demons. Guan Yu expressed his gratitude. What befell thereafter shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n---\n\n**The Patriarch Subdues the Thunder and Field Generals**\n\nThe Patriarch, having captured the sand blade spirit, continued onward with the Water, Fire, and other generals until they reached the region of Yongzhou. Suddenly, a flickering demonic aura and a sky-piercing grievance met their gaze. The Patriarch looked up to see an old man weeping bitterly as he approached. The Patriarch stepped forward and asked, “Elder, why do you weep so sorrowfully?”\n\nThe old man replied, “This is the land of Yongzhou. My name is Sun Hao, and my entire household of seven has observed the fast on the third day of the third month.”\n\nThe Patriarch asked, “Why observe the fast on the third day of the third month?”\n\nThe old man said, “I have heard that a man who cultivated the Dao on Mount Wudang has now ascended to Heaven. We seek his blessings, so we fast on his birthday.”\n\nThe Patriarch said, “Since you fast on his birthday, you are a virtuous man—no harm should befall you. Why then do you weep so bitterly today?”\n\nThe old man replied, “My weeping is not for the fast. Not far from here lies a mountain called Divine Thunder Mountain. Recently, a demon has appeared there, wearing a Daoist crown, his ghostly head bearing three eyes, wielding a hammer, and styling himself the **Newly Ascendant King**. This demon is lustful beyond measure. Whenever a local family has a maiden to be wed, they must send her to his mountain to spend the night before the wedding day—only then will she be allowed to proceed with the marriage. If they refuse, the demon emerges from the mountain and slays the entire family of the bride-to-be. I have a granddaughter named Jinlian, who is to be wed tomorrow. We had planned to send her, but she refuses to go. If she does not, my entire family will perish—hence my sorrow.”\n\nThe Patriarch said, “I possess the arts to vanquish demons. Do not weep—I shall save you.” The old man bowed in gratitude. The Patriarch instructed him to return home, maintain the fast with devotion, and prepare his granddaughter for the wedding, assuring him there was no need for concern. The old man thanked him and departed.\n\nThe Patriarch summoned Marshal Guan and ordered him to transform into a woman. The Patriarch himself took the form of an old man, and together they approached the cave entrance of Thunder God Mountain. The Newly Ascendant King, seeing the old man delivering a maiden, rejoiced and prepared to emerge from the cave to embrace her. The Patriarch let out a thunderous shout, and Marshal Guan reverted to his true form, charging into the cave. The demon, caught off guard, was seized and brought before the Patriarch. The Patriarch fed him a **Fire Elixir** and enlisted him as a general under his command.\n\nProceeding another thirty *li* or so, they came to a mountain called Fallen Spirit Mountain. Within it lay a cave named **Three Realizations Cave**, home to a chieftain named Tian Hua. He regularly sent lesser demons to patrol the mountain, demanding gold and silver as toll from travelers. Those who could not pay were struck dead by thunder, their bodies blown into the cave by a great wind, their hearts and livers plucked out to steep in wine. One day, as the lesser demons blocked the path ahead, the Patriarch and his company arrived. The demons demanded gold and silver as toll. Sensing the demonic aura clouding the sky, the Patriarch knew these were no ordinary bandits. Drawing his **Three Terraces Seven Stars Sword**, he struck, and the lesser demons fled. The Patriarch pursued them to the cave entrance. The demons rushed inside and reported to their lord, Tian Hua. Enraged, Tian Hua performed a spell within the cave, summoning divine thunder that flew toward the entrance. The Patriarch, seeing this, pointed his Seven Stars Sword and cried, “Halt!” The thunder stood still.",

      "translated_text": "Seeing the thunder stand still, Tian Hua emerged from the cave without a word, spear in hand, and lunged at the Patriarch. Unable to withstand the Patriarch’s might, Tian Hua turned to flee back into the cave, only to be ensnared by Marshal Zhao’s flaming lasso and brought before the Patriarch. Tian Hua pleaded for mercy and pledged allegiance. The Patriarch rejoiced, offering Tian Hua a pellet of Fire Elixir to consume, and took him into his ranks. With two generals now under his command, the Patriarch drafted a memorial to the Jade Emperor. Delighted, the Jade Emperor bestowed upon Xin Xing and Tian Hua the titles of Marshal Lei Kai and Marshal Gou Bi, each wielding a command tally to accompany the Patriarch in subduing demons. Xin Xing and Tian Hua expressed their gratitude.\n\nThe Patriarch and his company continued their journey. Seventy *li* later, they encountered an old man named Zhang Wan. Seeing the Patriarch and his followers dressed as Daoists, the old man stepped forward, bowed, and inquired, “Venerable masters, where are you bound?” The Patriarch replied, “We are traveling to subdue evil.” The old man said, “If you truly possess such powers, there is a mountain near my humble abode called Tou Ge Shan. Within it dwells a demon that reveals no form but, upon spying fine goods or fair maidens, whisks them into its cave with a gust of wind. If your arts are as potent as you claim, I beg you to vanquish this fiend and rid the people of this scourge.”\n\nThe Patriarch took his leave of the old man and led his company to Dou Ge Shan, where they raised a clamor of battle cries. From the cave emerged a figure with crimson hair and tusks, wielding a wind-wheel in one hand and a great blade in the other. He charged at the Patriarch, who met him with his sword. After twenty rounds, Guang Ze, unable to overcome the Patriarch, recited a true incantation. A furious gale erupted from the wind-wheel, scattering the Patriarch’s company and hurling the Patriarch himself beyond the Thirty-Second Heaven. Startled, the Patriarch found himself before a grand hall, its plaque inscribed with the words “Hall of No-Birth.” Entering, he saw a man clad in Daoist robes and cap. The Patriarch stepped forward, bowed, and asked his name. The Daoist replied, “I am Qi Zhao, known as the Water Terrace Immortal.” The Patriarch recounted how he had been blown away while subduing the demon. The Immortal smiled faintly and said, “You are an emanation of the Golden Palace—how have you not mastered this art?” The Patriarch replied, “This humble one is truly ignorant of it.” The Immortal said, “This wind is the pure *qi* of the North Wind, harnessed by this demon to harm others. If dispersed, it would bring coolness to all under heaven. I possess a pellet, forged from the wind and fire of a thousand kalpas. Take it, and when you face battle, the wind will not move you.”\n\nThe Patriarch received the elixir, bowed in thanks, and departed the hall. Riding the clouds, he returned to Dou Ge Shan, where he reunited with his company and recounted the events. The next morning at dawn, the Patriarch placed the pellet in his mouth and challenged Guang Ze to battle. Guang Ze once more unleashed his wind-wheel, but the Patriarch stood unmoved. Stunned, Guang Ze fumbled in dismay as the company seized him. He kowtowed and pledged allegiance. The Patriarch rejoiced. A decree from the Jade Emperor arrived, appointing Guang Ze as Marshal Zhou of the Wind-Wheel to accompany the Patriarch in his Way. What befell them thereafter? Tune in to the next chapter for the resolution.",

      "translated_text": "The Patriarch Subdues the Plague and Crosses Flame Mountain\n\nNow, in Ninghai County of Shandong, there emerged a demon unseen in form, who invaded people’s dreams. He called himself Zhang Jian, spreading the plague of pox and rashes to harm the young children of households. Wherever his touch fell, he planted the seeds of pox and rashes, bringing death to families’ sons and daughters.\n\nAs the Patriarch arrived, he saw a baleful cloud descending from the sky. Within it stood a man—fair of brow and bright of eye—wearing the helmet of Erlang, herding three children before him. The Patriarch drew his Three-Terrace Seven-Star Sword and struck at Zhang Jian from midair. Enraged, Zhang Jian unsheathed his blade to meet the blow. After fifty rounds, neither gained the upper hand.\n\nZhang Jian cried, “I have no quarrel with you! You dwell in the upper realm, and I in the middle—why not keep to your place?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied, “You spread plague to harm the people. I have come specifically to subdue you.”\n\nHearing this, Zhang Jian made no reply but renewed the battle. The Patriarch summoned his company, and they surged forward as one. Overwhelmed, Zhang Jian fled into his cave and barred the entrance. The Patriarch devised a plan: he had the Serpent Spirit transform into a child, weeping at the cave’s mouth. The lesser demons seized the child and brought it before Zhang Jian, who, thinking it a captive, opened his mouth to devour it. The Serpent Spirit reverted to its true form, slithering into his belly and writhing within. Zhang Jian writhed in agony, collapsing to the ground.\n\nFrom within his stomach, the Serpent Spirit spoke: “Open the cave door and welcome my master and his company. Refuse, and I will crawl inside you until you die.”\n\nZhang Jian hastily unbarred the entrance, admitting the Patriarch and his followers. He knelt, begging for mercy. The Patriarch was pleased. He gave Zhang Jian an elixir of fire to swallow, then bade the Serpent Spirit emerge. A decree from the Jade Emperor soon arrived, appointing Zhang Jian as Marshal Zhang of Utmost Loyalty, wielding the Plague Mallet to follow the Patriarch in his teachings and save the people. The Patriarch then departed Ninghai County.\n\nA hundred *li* from the county stood Flame Mountain. As dusk fell, the Patriarch and his company sought rest upon its slopes when suddenly a baleful cloud arose, alarming all. From its midst emerged a demon chief wearing a Daoist crown, brandishing a Fire-Wheel Blade. Before him, a lesser demon held a crimson banner inscribed: “Great King Xie Shirong of the Water-Defying Citadel.” They descended from the sky to attack.\n\nGenerals Guan and Zhang advanced to meet them. Shirong spewed true fire—its radiance dazzling, its heat overwhelming—and the two generals were forced to retreat. Seeing his commanders falter, the Patriarch drew his Three-Terrace Seven-Star Sword to join the fray. Shirong exhaled more flames, but the Patriarch intoned a true incantation, summoning the Tortoise General. With his Six-Star Sword, he pointed north, drawing forth the true water of Kan. The deluge surged forward.\n\nShirong, being of fire, saw the true water approach and his flames extinguished. A chill seized his body, and he fled back into his cave, barring the entrance. Seeing Shirong refuse to emerge, the Patriarch devised another plan: he had the Tortoise Spirit transform into a lesser demon and descend from the sky to brawl with the cave’s minions before Zhang Jian’s eyes. The Tortoise Spirit then reverted to its true form, flooding the cave with water. Panicked, Shirong rushed out, only for the Patriarch to point his sword and summon the true fire of Kan—its flames billowing, engulfing the cave. Trapped within, Shirong shivered uncontrollably, while his minions wailed in despair, all drowned in the deluge. Only Shirong, half-dead from the cold, found himself cornered with no escape. Tian Hua stormed into the cave and seized him, bringing him before the Patriarch.\n\nThe Patriarch asked, “Will you surrender?”\n\nShirong, nearly frozen to death, had no choice but to submit. The Patriarch displayed his divine power, extracting three measures of true fire from Kan and condensing them into a pellet, which he gave Shirong to swallow. He then memorialized the Jade Emperor, who, greatly pleased, dispatched a celestial envoy bearing a decree. Shirong was appointed Fire Virtue Lord Xie, wielding a golden whip and Fire-Wheel Blade to follow the Patriarch in his teachings. Shirong expressed his gratitude, and the company departed Flame Mountain.\n\nThe Patriarch left Flame Mountain and arrived at Kunlun Mountain, where six demons—self-styled the Six Poisons of Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon, Year, and Time—lurked within. They often lay in ambush along the roads, poisoning travelers who passed by, none escaping unscathed.\n\nAs the Patriarch neared Kunlun Mountain, he saw the demons gathering and warned his company, “These fiends are no ordinary foes. Their glow betrays poisonous qi—be on your guard.”\n\nBefore he could finish, a violent gust assailed them. The Patriarch raised his Three-Terrace Seven-Star Sword to block it, but the poisonous qi struck him full in the face, knocking him senseless. His followers scattered in terror. Moments later, the qi dissipated, and the company regrouped to search for the Patriarch. They found him collapsed, unconscious. Dismayed, Generals Guan and the others exchanged helpless glances, unable to revive him.\n\nGuan then addressed the company: “Watch over the Patriarch’s body. I will ascend to the upper realm to seek the Three Pure Ones’ counsel.”\n\nThe others assented. Guan immediately mounted the clouds and ascended to the heavens, where he prostrated himself before the Three Pure Ones and recounted how the Patriarch had been felled by poison.",

They unleashed their poison sack beneath the mountain to wreak havoc. To save your master, you must journey to Kunlun and summon Zhu Yanfu—only then can he be revived.”\n\nGeneral Guan replied, “I fear that if I go, Yanfu will refuse to save my master.”\n\nThe Three Pure Ones said, “If you go alone, he will not comply. That man possesses a treasure called the Poison Sack, most formidable indeed. We shall accompany you. First, we will revive your master, then he may go to meet Yanfu. If he refuses to submit, when your master moves to subdue the Six Toxins, you must use a stratagem to capture him.”\n\nOverjoyed, General Guan ascended with the Three Pure Ones upon the clouds, arriving at Kunlun Mountain. There, they saw the Patriarch enveloped in toxic qi, unconscious and insensible. The Three Pure Ones recited the true incantation and waved a fan, dispersing the poisonous vapors. They sprinkled pure water over the Patriarch’s body, circling him as they did so, and exhaled three breaths upon him. The Patriarch stirred faintly, opening his eyes to see the Three Pure Ones. He immediately prostrated himself in obeisance.\n\nThe Three Pure Ones said, “You were lost to the Six Toxins’ qi. To eradicate this poison, you must ascend Kunlun’s peak and entreat Zhu Yanfu to remove it.”\n\nThe Patriarch asked, “What method shall I use to dispel it?”\n\nThe Three Pure Ones replied, “If you engage him in battle, he will surely open his Poison Sack to ensnare your generals. I possess a treasure fan called the Carefree Fan, which has endured through countless kalpas. No perverse or demonic qi dares approach it—one wave and all is vanquished. Take it and give it to your subordinate, Marshal Xie, who is originally the Star of Fire Virtue. Should you meet in battle and Yanfu opens his sack, have Marshal Xie enter it bearing my fan. Let him burn his way out with fire, and the Poison Sack will be destroyed, unable to capture you. Only then can you subdue this man. If Yanfu surrenders, return the fan to the upper realm without delay.”\n\nThe Patriarch bowed deeply in gratitude. The Three Pure Ones then mounted the clouds and returned to their celestial palace.\n\nThe Patriarch immediately instructed Marshal Xie to follow the plan. At dawn the next day, he ascended with his generals to the summit of Kunlun Mountain and entered to see Zhu Yanfu. Yanfu sat unmoving. The Patriarch stepped forward and bowed, but Yanfu, still seated, haughtily demanded, “Who comes here?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied, “I am Zhenwu, the Perfected Martial General of the North, sent by the Jade Decree to subdue the black qi below.”\n\nYanfu asked, “Why have you come here to subdue black qi?”\n\nThe Patriarch said, “There is a scourge of Six Toxins beneath the mountain. I hear it is caused by your subordinates, who harm the people. I ask you to subdue them.”\n\nYanfu retorted, “You were sent to subdue black qi, yet you oppose my generals. If you cannot subdue them, how dare you come before me?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied, “I was sent to eradicate all demonic black qi, serving the Jade Emperor and relieving the people’s suffering.

      "translated_text": "The Patriarch was about to set forth with his retinue when suddenly a propitious cloud descended, bearing the Star Lord of the West, Tai Bai. A jade decree arrived, which he proclaimed:\n\n\"Since you entered the Dao, We have been filled with joy. The black qi of the Middle Realm has gradually been severed. Yet We did not expect Hua Guang to remain unchanged in his original heart—striking Our prince and later setting fire to the Southern Heaven’s Precious Virtue Pass, throwing the Celestial Palace into chaos. The ministers have recommended you, for you are the Water of the Northern Ren and Gui, capable of extinguishing the Fire of the Southern Bing and Ding. You are to subdue Hua Guang. Upon receiving this decree, proceed at once without delay!\"\n\nThe Patriarch expressed his gratitude and accepted the decree. He instructed his generals to accompany the Star Lord Tai Bai, and together they rode the clouds straight into the Celestial Pass, where they encountered Hua Guang. The Patriarch drew his Three Terraces Sword and shouted, \"Who comes? Do not be rude!\"\n\nHua Guang replied, \"I am one who delights in this renowned place, fond of wine and women, known as the Flower-and-Wine Marshal Ma Lingguan.\"\n\nThe Patriarch asked, \"Are you not the former Hua Guang?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered.\n\nThe Patriarch said, \"What grievance have you against the Jade Emperor that you dare set fire to the Southern Heaven’s Pass?\"\n\nHua Guang retorted, \"You dwell in the North, and I burn the South—what concern is it of yours?\"\n\nThe Patriarch declared, \"I am here by the Jade Emperor’s decree to capture you. Surrender peacefully, or in an instant, I shall reduce you to nothing.\"\n\nHua Guang, being of a fiery nature, did not reply but instead brandished his long spear and lunged at the Patriarch. The Patriarch displayed his divine power, his head reaching the Thirty-Three Heavens and his feet spanning the Five Lakes and Four Seas. Upon seeing this, Hua Guang transformed into a being with three heads and six arms, engaging the Patriarch in fierce battle. The Patriarch rallied his generals, who charged from all sides. Hua Guang was soundly defeated and fled toward the North.\n\nThe Patriarch pursued him, but Hua Guang, seeing this, hurled his Three-Cornered Golden Brick. The Patriarch used his banner to roll it up and capture it. Frustrated, Hua Guang then unleashed his Wind and Fire Wheels, but the Patriarch seized them with his Seven-Star Sword. Panicked, Hua Guang threw his Fire Pellets, only for them to be similarly ensnared. With no escape, Hua Guang fought desperately. The Patriarch summoned the Water of the Northern Ren and Gui, overwhelming Hua Guang and pinning him to the ground with his Water-Subduing Staff, rendering him immobile.\n\nNow, Hua Guang had originally been a pile of lamp wicks before the Tathāgata, who later recited a true mantra to transform him. He was the essence, spirit, and yin of fire, and thus, upon encountering the Water of the Northern Ren and Gui, he could not escape and was captured by the Celestial Emperor.\n\nThe Patriarch said, \"You beast, ignorant of worldly affairs—what power did you possess to strike the prince? Now that you are captured, what excuse do you have?\"\n\nPressed beneath the water, unable to move his limbs, Hua Guang wept, \"This disciple was driven by Deng Hua’s coercion, forced into this act. Now that I am seized by the Celestial Emperor, I beg for your compassion and mercy.\"\n\nThe Patriarch replied, \"If you are willing to abandon evil and return to the right path, I shall enlist you as a general under my command.\"\n\nHua Guang promptly agreed, \"If the Celestial Emperor is willing to save me, I vow to submit and never rebel again.\"\n\nThe Patriarch then took out a Water-Gathering Pearl, transformed it into a pellet, and instructed Hua Guang to swallow it. \"I shall spare you thus.\"\n\nHua Guang had no choice but to comply. The Patriarch warned, \"That pellet is my Water-Gathering Pearl. If you harbor any rebellious thoughts, I shall recite the incantation, and the water in your belly will boil, reducing you to water within seven days.\"\n\nHua Guang said, \"I am forever indebted to the Celestial Emperor for saving my life and shall remain at your side.\"\n\nThe Celestial Emperor, hearing this, lifted the Water-Subduing Staff and released Hua Guang.\n\nHua Guang then said, \"Though you have taken me in, the Celestial Soldiers press closely to capture me. How may I escape the Celestial Court?\"\n\nThe Patriarch replied, \"You are a fire star—head south.\"\n\nHua Guang said, \"My dharma treasures have all been taken by you. How can I go?\"\n\nThe Patriarch returned his former treasures to him. Hua Guang bid farewell to the Patriarch and descended to the Middle Realm.\n\nThe Patriarch returned to the Jade Emperor and, after the customary prostrations, the Jade Emperor asked, \"We summoned you to capture Hua Guang. Have you done so?\"\n\nThe Patriarch replied, \"Your servant has indeed subdued Hua Guang.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor said, \"Since you have captured him, why not bring him before Us for sentencing?\"\n\nThe Patriarch petitioned, \"This servant observes that Hua Guang did not rebel out of malice but was driven by circumstances. I beg Your Majesty to show mercy and allow Hua Guang to assist in the Middle Realm in subduing the black qi. If he renders merit in the future, let it offset his crimes.\"\n\nThe Jade Emperor assented. The Patriarch then requested permission to descend to the mortal realm to subdue the black qi. The Five Emperors, upon hearing this, were greatly pleased. They personally offered three cups of imperial wine and draped him with ceremonial silk before departing the Golden Palace.\n\nExiting the Southern Heaven’s Precious Virtue Pass, the Patriarch descended to the mortal realm with his generals, resuming their journey along the familiar path. They arrived at a place under the jurisdiction of Huaizhou Prefecture.",

      "translated_text": "In the village, they encountered a man weeping bitterly as he approached. The Patriarch stepped forward and asked, \"Venerable elder, why do you weep so?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"I am Li Zhoufang. In our village, two years ago, a demon appeared, visiting the dreams of the villagers. It claimed its name was Dang Guiji, its body black in hue, and demanded that we build a temple in its honor. It insisted that during the New Year and the Dragon Boat Festival, we offer it the three sacrificial animals along with wine and sweet liquor; if we refused, it would take five lives from our village each day. The villagers did not believe it at first, but true to its word, within three days, fifteen of us perished. In fear, we built a temple and made offerings, and indeed, we enjoyed a year of peace.\n\nThis year, as the Dragon Boat Festival approaches, the demon has again appeared in the villagers’ dreams, declaring that this year it does not want the three sacrificial animals or wine and sweet liquor—it demands that I send my daughter to the temple to serve it for a full year, to be released on the corresponding day next year. If I refuse, it will slaughter everyone in the village. I have only this one daughter, and if I do not send her, it will harm all the villagers. On the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, the people will come to my home to seize her and take her to the temple. I am trapped with no way out, and so I weep in despair.\"\n\nThe Patriarch said, \"Venerable elder, do not weep. My disciples and I possess the arts to subdue this demon.\" Upon hearing this, Li Zhoufang bowed in gratitude.\n\nThe Patriarch said, \"No need for bows. Return home in peace; all will be resolved.\" Zhoufang took his leave and departed.\n\nThe Patriarch then summoned Zhu Yanfu, transforming him into a maiden while he himself took the form of Li Zhoufang. He instructed them to lie in ambush beside the temple and enter it as planned. The lesser demons reported to Dang Guiji, who rejoiced and emerged from his cave, descending the steps to embrace the maiden and carry her inside. The Patriarch then revealed his true form, drawing his Seven-Star Sword, while Marshal Zhu also resumed his original shape. As Dang Guiji attempted to flee, the serpent spirit from the rack leapt down and coiled around him, pinning him to the ground. Dang Guiji cried out in misery.\n\nThe Patriarch asked, \"Will you surrender?\" Guiji repeatedly declared his willingness to yield. The Patriarch took out a Fire Elixir, fed it to Guiji, and set the temple ablaze. He then submitted a memorial to the Jade Emperor, who appointed Dang Guiji as the Examining Marshal of the Dang Regiment, wielding a bamboo staff and following the Patriarch to subdue demons. After Guiji expressed his gratitude, the Patriarch and his company continued on their way.\n\nMeanwhile, the villagers, seeing the flames in the temple extinguished and no further calamities befalling them, all gazed heavenward and bowed in thanks. The Patriarch, perceiving this with his wisdom-eye, turned his cloud around and descended before the people. Li Zhoufang, along with the villagers, bowed and said, \"Had it not been for Your Daoist Truth, our entire village would have perished. May we know your honorable name?\"\n\nThe Patriarch wrote six characters in the air: \"Northern True Martial General.\" Then, ascending halfway into the sky, he let his hair flow loose behind him, his feet treading upon the tortoise and serpent, his hand gripping the Three Terraces Seven-Star Sword. The people looked up and bowed deeply. In an instant, he vanished from sight.",

      "translated_text": "The villagers erected a temple and enshrined the Patriarch’s statue, offering daily devotion—this need not be recounted further.\n\nNow, in the Black Pine Forest of Xi’an Prefecture, there lived a demon named Kang Xi, who wore an Erlang helmet and bore three strands of whiskers tied with melon vines. He dwelled in Benevolent Sage Crag, stirring up malevolence. The Patriarch and his retinue arrived at Black Pine Forest, where Kang Xi transformed into a bandit blocking the path, demanding gold, treasures, and meat as toll. The Patriarch replied, “We are ascetics—where would we obtain such things?”\n\nKang Xi said, “If you have none, dare you call out to me three times, and I shall let you pass.”\n\nThe Patriarch declared, “If truly we possess no treasures or meat, I dare call ten times.”\n\nNo sooner had the Patriarch spoken than Kang Xi muttered an incantation, summoning a bronze bell from midair to trap him beneath it. Kang Xi then returned to his cave. The generals strove to lift the bell but could not, their hearts heavy with distress. They sent the Serpent Spirit to seek the Venerable Miaole.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy asked the Serpent Spirit, “You follow your master to subdue demons—why have you come here?”\n\nThe Serpent Spirit recounted how their master had been ensnared by the bell. The Heavenly Worthy descended with the Serpent Spirit, intoning a true spell. Drawing a bowl of pure water, he cast it eastward, and an eastern wind blew the bell aside. The Patriarch lay lifeless within. The Heavenly Worthy placed a pellet of Returning-Soul Elixir into his mouth and exhaled upon him thrice. The Patriarch revived, bowing in gratitude.\n\nInquiring about the demon, the Heavenly Worthy replied, “This fiend is on intimate terms with the Smoky Daoist of the rear cave. The Daoist is not presently in his abode, and his whereabouts are unknown. I shall transform into a Daoist priest, and the Serpent Spirit into an immortal elixir. We shall deliver it to the demon—he will surely suspect nothing. Once he consumes the elixir, we shall subdue him.”\n\nThe Patriarch rejoiced and waited with his generals at the foot of Black Pine Forest. The Heavenly Worthy transformed into a Daoist priest, while the Serpent Spirit became an elixir. They approached the cave, and a lesser demon announced their arrival. Kang Xi emerged to greet them.\n\nThe Daoist priest said, “I have long admired Your Excellency’s renown. Hearing of the great king’s recent exertions, my humble cave has refined two immortal elixirs. Unworthy to consume them myself, I humbly present one to augment Your Excellency’s lifespan by a century.”\n\nKang Xi, overjoyed, bowed in thanks and swallowed the elixir. The Heavenly Worthy asked, “Do you recognize me?”\n\nKang Xi replied, “Why speak so madly? We have long been acquainted—how could I not know you?”\n\nThe Venerable Miaole declared, “I am no Daoist priest,” and revealed his true form. Kang Xi, beholding it, was struck with terror.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said, “You have just consumed an elixir—transformed from my Serpent Spirit. For trapping the Patriarch beneath the bell, I have come to seize you.”\n\nKang Xi refused to believe it. The Heavenly Worthy called out to the Serpent Spirit, who responded from within Kang Xi’s belly, slithering upward. Kang Xi clutched his stomach in agony and collapsed. The Heavenly Worthy asked, “Will you submit?”\n\nOvercome by pain, the demon relented. The Heavenly Worthy bade the Patriarch enter the cave, retrieve a Fire Elixir, and feed it to Kang Xi, then summon the Serpent Spirit forth. The Venerable Miaole ascended on clouds to memorialize the Jade Emperor, who bestowed upon Kang Xi the title Benevolent Sage Marshal Kang, wielding a golden axe to aid the Patriarch in subduing demons—this shall be recounted later.\n\nHow the tale unfolds next shall be revealed in the following chapter.

      "translated_text": "Now, in a village of Guizhou Prefecture stood a bridge called the Spirit-Passing Bridge. Beneath it lay tens of thousands of ghostly soldiers who emerged at dead of night, vanishing by dawn with mournful cries. Their leader was one Pang Qiao, who wore a golden circlet upon his head. From dusk till midnight, none dared cross the bridge or sail beneath it, for any boatman who passed would be dragged into the water and devoured, his corpse never to be seen. The villagers shunned the bridge, and ferrymen refused to ply their craft.\n\nThe Patriarch arrived with his generals at the bridge’s edge as dusk fell. They rested beneath its span, and at the first watch, a chill wind howled as ghostly wails rose in the dark. The Patriarch warned, “Disciples, another demon lurks here—remain vigilant.” Before he could finish, the ghostly horde swarmed the bridge, seizing the men. The Patriarch and his followers drew their blades and struck, driving the ghosts back into the water. Tortoise and Serpent Generals, wielding the Golden Fiery Sand Blade, charged after them. The ghosts fled to report to Pang Qiao, who burst from his lair to engage the two generals. Outmatched, Tortoise and Serpent retreated to the shore, only for Pang Qiao to pursue—until he met Marshal Zhu, who clashed with him in fierce combat. The Marshal cast his Five-Poison Bag, ensnaring Pang Qiao within. Bound and brought before the Patriarch, Pang Qiao kowtowed in submission. The Patriarch fed him a Human Elixir, then memorialized the Jade Emperor. By imperial decree, Pang Qiao was named Marshal of Primal Qi, armed with a golden blade to aid the Patriarch in subduing demons.\n\nThe tale now turns elsewhere. In the heavens, the Purple Tenuity Star faced calamity, falling to the mortal realm and taking birth in the household of Elder Gao of the Western Forests. Unnoticed, time flew like an arrow, days and months like a shuttle, until fifteen years had passed. The Purple Tenuity grew into a man of striking presence, named Gao Yuan, his bearing noble and his features refined. Meanwhile, Emperor Yang of the Sui, heir to the throne, held court with his ministers. Lu Pingshu stepped forth and petitioned, “Your Majesty has no heir, only a daughter, Princess Yusheng, now come of age. You might select a consort for her as a joyous occasion—perhaps an heir may yet come.” The Emperor approved, decreeing the erection of a bridal pavilion. Gao Yuan, still unwed, heard of the imperial selection and wandered beneath the pavilion. The Princess, struck by his elegant bearing, cast down her jade silk whip, summoning him into the palace. Delighted, the Emperor named Gao Yuan her consort and held a grand feast for his ministers.\n\nThe next day, Emperor Yang ascended the throne. A messenger presented an urgent memorial: the northern barbarian king had rebelled, his armies assaulting the frontier. Enraged, the Emperor demanded counsel. Lu Pingshu advised, “Your Majesty’s newly chosen consort could lead the troops, with Yang Qinhu, son of Yang Li—peerless in valor—as vanguard. Only thus may the barbarians be repelled.” The Emperor agreed, dispatching Yang Qinhu and the consort to the front. There, the consort clashed with the barbarian general Nada’er, who proved no match for Yang Qinhu and fled in defeat. The consort pressed the attack, slaughtering countless foes until the barbarian king retreated north. Returning in triumph, the consort was received with joy, though the Emperor’s nights remained troubled by the lack of an heir. He commissioned endless rituals, yet never once ascended the altar himself, instead reveling in the palace and bleeding the realm dry.\n\nOn the seventh day of the seventh month, a star plunged into the consort’s estate, its radiance dazzling—none other than the Purple Tenuity Star. That night, the consort dreamed of ascending the Golden Palace before awakening, the star’s descent now explained. The Emperor, drinking in the palace, witnessed the spectacle and demanded, “What fell, and where?” His ministers reported it had landed in the consort’s residence. Enraged, the Emperor summoned the consort the next day. After the customary obeisance, he declared, “I chose you as consort, yet after three years, you have given me nothing. Last night, a luminous object fell into your home—clearly a demonic omen.” He ordered the consort’s execution. Terrified, Gao Yuan kowtowed and pleaded, “I am a man of the west, son of Gao Lin—how could I be a demon? Spare me, and if I bear no son within a year, I will accept my fate. I am no demon.” The Emperor’s wrath cooled, and he relented.\n\nThe consort returned home and recounted the ordeal to the Princess. Horrified, she burned incense nightly in the rear garden, praying for an heir. One day, as she dozed in the garden, the Star of Venus appeared in her dream, saying, “Your father is without the Way and deserves no heir. Your husband is a celestial star, cast down for offending the Jade Emperor—thus, you too shall have no child.” With that, the vision vanished. The Princess awoke and told the consort of the dream. Overcome, he wept, then bade her farewell and hanged himself in the rear hall. The Princess, finding him, wailed in grief and petitioned the Emperor for a proper burial, which was granted.\n\nAs for the consort, his soul drifted aimlessly until the local earth god, recognizing the fallen Purple Tenuity, prepared to escort him to the Lord of the Underworld.",

The earth god came forth to greet them and reported the matter of the consort. The Patriarch ordered the earth god to bring the soul before him. The consort recounted all that had transpired. The Patriarch then drafted a memorial to the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor pardoned the Purple Tenuity’s former offenses and enfeoffed him as the Fierce-Nature Marshal Gao Yuan, Descended from the Nine Heavens, wielding a bronze sword in his left hand and a golden basin in his right, within which rested a coiled topknot of purple-gold. He was to follow the Patriarch in subduing demons. Marshal Gao expressed his gratitude and withdrew.\n\nAs for what transpired later, that shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\nThe Patriarch Acquires the Five Thunders and Five Tones\nNow, in the western lands there stood a mountain called Mount Chasi. Within it, the people had built a temple, and in that temple stood five divine statues, each with a name: Zhou Chang, Zhao Guang, Shi Ding, Liu Ze, and Pei Jian. As the Patriarch and his retinue pursued the dark qi, they suddenly encountered a great rain. Seeking shelter, they entered the temple. Just as they were about to sit, they saw malevolent qi surging. The Patriarch was startled; looking up, he saw the five statues come to life and begin brawling among themselves. As the Patriarch and his company attempted to flee the temple, the sky darkened in an instant, clouds and mist swirling, and thunder roared, shaking heaven and earth. The Patriarch found himself unable to move, his head pounding, his vision blurring, and he collapsed to the ground in a stupor. Marshal Guan, alarmed, rushed forward and carried the Patriarch out of the temple, but he remained insensible. The retinue, distressed, resolved to send Marshal Gao to ride the clouds and summon the Venerable Miaole to revive the Patriarch.\n\nNow, the Venerable Miaole was seated in the Hall of Longevity when Marshal Gao arrived. “You follow your master in subduing demons,” he said. “Why have you come here?” Marshal Gao recounted how they had entered the temple and been struck by thunder, leaving the Patriarch unconscious. The Venerable said, “The five within the temple are the Five Thunder Gods. Only when they fight among themselves does thunder sound. Since your master has been harmed and lies insensible, you must hasten to the Eastern Heaven and summon the master of the Five Thunders to subdue this menace.” Marshal Gao asked, “Who is their master?” The Venerable replied, “The Thunder Lord is surnamed Deng, named Cheng, and styled Heavenly Lord. He resides in the Taihua Palace. Go swiftly.”\n\nMarshal Gao took his leave of the Venerable and journeyed directly to the Taihua Palace, where he paid his respects to the Heavenly Lord Deng. The Heavenly Lord said, “I hear you accompany the Northern General in pursuing dark qi. Why have you come here?” Marshal Gao replied, “I follow my master in subduing demons. We arrived at a place where, within a temple, five deities suddenly began fighting among themselves. Thunder resounded, and my master fled the temple but fell insensible. I inquired of the Venerable, who said they are your subordinates. I beg you to issue your command to subdue the Five Thunder Gods and revive my master.” The Heavenly Lord, having heard this, descended to the mortal realm with Marshal Gao. After the retinue exchanged greetings, the Heavenly Lord performed his arts: he filled his mouth with water and sprayed it upon the Patriarch’s face, whereupon the Patriarch awoke and bowed in thanks. The Heavenly Lord strode to the temple gates, let out a great shout, and brandished his command tablet. The Five Thunder Gods knelt before him. With a gesture toward the southern direction, he summoned forth five Thunder Lords—sharp-beaked, chicken-winged, wielding pointed hammers—who advanced. The five deities revealed their true forms, which were but five drums, now restrained by the Thunder Gods. The Heavenly Lord said, “I shall not keep these Five Thunders. Let them follow you to subdue demons.” The Patriarch rejoiced. The Heavenly Lord then returned to the Taihua Palace, while the Patriarch, now accompanied by the Five Thunders, journeyed onward.\n\nThey arrived at a place where a mountain called White Rock Mountain stood.

Under its command were twelve lesser generals: the first named Mountain Demon, the second Water Monster, the third Stone Demon, the fourth Cliff Demon, the fifth Metal Demon, the sixth Wood Demon, the seventh Earth Demon, the eighth Fire Demon, the ninth Mud Demon, the tenth Sand Demon, the eleventh Human Demon, and the twelfth Star Demon. It possessed a dharma-treasure—a paper ledger of some thirty-odd pages—imbued with great numinous power. Whenever it encountered humans, it would unfurl the ledger, and the people would enter of their own accord, only to be carried into the cave and devoured. One day, Tian Guai emerged from the cave and chanced upon the Patriarch. Unprepared, the master and disciples were caught off guard when two of the demon’s underlings unfurled the ledger, trapping the entire company within. They were borne back to the cave, where Tian Guai rejoiced and ordered his minions to prepare a feast, intending to bring out the Patriarch and his followers to be cooked.\n\nHearing this, the captives were alarmed. Marshal Ma said, “Fear not. This ledger is made of paper, and I carry fire pellets. Ready your weapons and wait.” With that, Marshal Ma produced a fire pellet, while Marshal Zhou activated his wind wheel. The fire drew strength from the wind, and the wind fed the flames, setting the ledger ablaze. As it burned through, the company burst out, weapons in hand, and gave chase. Tian Guai fled with the ledger. Before the Patriarch, Marshal Deng, and Marshal Gao could emerge, they were swept away with the ledger by Tian Guai. The remaining marshals, unable to find the three, were deeply distressed. They conferred and decided to seek the Three Pure Ones, prostrating themselves to recount the events.\n\nThe Three Pure Ones listened and summoned the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Music to the hall. They said, “Your disciples now face peril, trapped within the ledger by Tian Guai and unable to escape. Their companions have come to seek aid.

      "translated_text": "The Heavenly Worthy took leave of the Three Pure Ones and ascended to the summit of White Rock Mountain. Entering the hermitage, he met the Perfected Jiang, who came forth to receive him with reverence. After the bows were exchanged, the Heavenly Worthy asked, “Is your dharma-treasure still in your possession?” The Perfected Jiang replied, “My dharma-treasure was entrusted to Tian Guai for safekeeping in the cave.” The Heavenly Worthy said, “If it remains there, bring it forth for me to see.” The Perfected Jiang entered the cave to search but found nothing. Greatly alarmed, he emerged to inform the Heavenly Worthy. The Heavenly Worthy smiled and said, “You tempered yourself through five hundred kalpas to obtain this treasure, yet you did not guard it with care. I have come precisely for this treasure of yours.” The Perfected Jiang said, “Since you have come for my treasure, you must know its whereabouts. I beg you to guide me in finding it.” The Heavenly Worthy replied, “The True Martial General of the North descended to the mortal realm by jade decree to subdue the black qi. Arriving at White Rock Mountain, he encountered Tian Guai, who opened your treasure and seized my disciples into the ledger. You remain unaware. Hasten now to rescue my disciples and retrieve the dharma-treasure, lest you violate the heavenly statutes.”\n\nHearing this, the Perfected Jiang was greatly shocked. He accompanied the Heavenly Worthy to the cave’s entrance and summoned Tian Guai. Upon learning of his master’s arrival, Tian Guai emerged with twelve demonic generals to greet the Perfected Jiang. At the sight of Tian Guai and his followers, the Perfected Jiang instantly revealed his true form—three-eyed, blue-faced, and fanged. With a single roar, the twelve demons reverted to their original shapes, and Tian Guai transformed back into his true form: a great brush, wailing in despair upon the ground. The Perfected Jiang cursed Tian Guai, then pointed at the paper ledger with his hand, extracting the Patriarch and the other two. Seizing Tian Guai, the Perfected Jiang reclaimed the dharma-ledger and commanded Tian Guai to submit to the Patriarch. Taking leave of the Heavenly Worthy, he returned to his cave. The Heavenly Worthy instructed Tian Guai to follow the Patriarch and perform the dharma, then parted ways to return to the Great Court. The Patriarch bestowed a pellet of Fire Elixir upon Tian Guai, who consumed it and continued along the path. What transpired thereafter shall be revealed in the following chapter.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Four: The Patriarch Subdues the Sky-Obscuring Canopy**\n\nThe Patriarch bid farewell to the Perfected Jiang and the Heavenly Worthy, then journeyed with his marshals for a day until they reached a place called Purple Radiance Mountain. Within the mountain lay a cave named Yellow Sand Hollow, where a demon named Yu Tian resided. His form was that of a dragon’s body with a ghostly head, and he possessed a dharma-treasure called the Sky-Obscuring Canopy. With five thousand demonic soldiers, he frequently wreaked havoc before Purple Radiance Mountain, tormenting living beings. As the Patriarch and his company arrived at the mountain’s base, they saw a streak of demonic clouds approach. From within emerged a figure—ghost-headed and dragon-bodied—who brandished the Sky-Obscuring Canopy, casting it into the air. Instantly, all before them vanished from sight. The Patriarch and his followers were struck with alarm. In an instant, the canopy enveloped them, plunging them into the earth, leaving them unable to escape. Only Marshal Deng and Marshal Xin, who lagged behind, evaded capture. They fled upon the clouds to the Palace of Great Florescence, where they found the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Music and recounted the events.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said, “This is no ordinary treasure’s mischief—it is the work of the Sky-Obscuring Canopy of Marshal Zhang An of the Southern Heaven. You two need not despair. I shall accompany you to see Marshal Zhang and ask him to rescue your master.” With that, the three set off to the palace of Marshal Zhang. Finding him seated in meditation, the marshal rose to receive them and inquired as to their purpose. The Heavenly Worthy recounted the events in full. Marshal Zhang replied, “This is my fault. Heavenly Worthy, you need not descend to the mortal realm—I shall go with these two.” The Heavenly Worthy, greatly pleased, took leave of Marshal Zhang. The marshal then accompanied the two marshals upon the clouds, gazing down to see a lingering yellow cloud—none other than the Sky-Obscuring Canopy ensnaring the company. Marshal Zhang ordered Deng and Xin to descend and engage Yu Tian in battle. The two marshals obeyed, wielding their weapons as they advanced.\n\nAt the sight of them, Yu Tian rallied his lesser demons to fight. They clashed for three hundred rounds without victory or defeat. From the clouds, Marshal Zhang observed the battle, then raised his sword and exhaled a breath of water, revealing his true form—a Thunder Command Tablet. Grasping the tablet, he performed the dharma, reciting the true incantation and beckoning with his hand. The Sky-Obscuring Canopy stirred, revealing its true form: a yellow banner. Marshal Zhang seized it and tore it open, freeing the Patriarch and his disciples. Emerging from the canopy, the Patriarch questioned Marshal Zhang, and Marshals Deng and Xin recounted the events. Overjoyed, the Patriarch watched as Marshal Zhang released his grip, commanding Yu Tian to submit to the Patriarch.\n\nMarshal Zhang returned to the heavenly court and memorialized the Jade Emperor. A decree arrived, appointing the Three Marshals as the Thunder Gate, with Deng, Xin, and Zhang as the Thunder Marshals. They were assigned to the Judgment Office of Xinjiang County, where Zhang An oversaw the Thunder Gate. The Patriarch rejoiced and bestowed Fire Elixir upon them. Another jade decree arrived, appointing Yu Tian as the Marshal for Subduing Demonic and Heretical Rain, wielding the Thunder Command Yellow Banner to remain ever at the Patriarch’s side, following his teachings. The Patriarch likewise bestowed Fire Elixir upon him, and the company continued on their journey.\n\nThey traveled until they reached a place called Black Tiger Mountain. Within the mountain dwelled two great spirits: one named Ren Wubie, the other Ning Shikua. They wielded a Moon Axe, wreaking havoc upon the mortal realm, seizing people into their cave to make meat buns for consumption.",

Upon seeing them, the two demons seized their axes and hurled them forth, transforming endlessly as they slashed. Marshal Ma, alarmed at the sight of the axes, immediately cast forth Fire Elixir, smelting the jade axes to fall to the ground. He then inverted his golden bell to cover them, capturing the two demons, and brought them before the Patriarch. The demons kowtowed, swearing allegiance. The Patriarch bestowed Fire Elixir upon them to consume. What transpired thereafter shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\nThe Jade Emperor Dispatches an Envoy to Destroy a Village\nThe Patriarch, having gained Ren and Ning as his generals, rejoiced greatly. After traveling with his company for several days, they arrived at a place called Celestial Fire Mountain. Within the mountain dwelled a demon named Liu Hou, who wielded a flying whip and rode a fire chariot. Each year, the villagers below offered a boy and girl as sacrifices; if they failed to do so, Liu Hou would set fire to their homes. That year, the village head, Li Shan, had purchased a boy and girl from a poor family and was about to present them at the cave to sacrifice to Liu Hou. The children, ignorant of the ways of the world, wept bitterly at the temple gate, for their parents, having no money, had no choice but to sell them. As they wailed, the Patriarch and his company arrived before the temple. Inquiring into the matter, the children tearfully recounted their plight. The Patriarch was shocked. Marshal Ma, enraged upon hearing their tale, freed the children, seized his golden spear, and charged into the temple. There, he encountered Liu Hou, who came forth wielding his flying whip. The two clashed fiercely. Marshal Ma hurled his golden brick, striking Liu Hou to the ground, and brought him before the Patriarch. The Patriarch rejoiced. Liu Hou kowtowed, swearing allegiance, and the Patriarch took him in, bestowing Fire Elixir upon him to consume. A memorial was then sent to the Five Emperors, who appointed Liu Hou as Heavenly Lord of the Royal Court, wielding his flying whip and riding his fire chariot, to follow the Patriarch in the Dao.\n\nOne day, the Jade Emperor ascended his throne. The Hearth God of Ban Bamboo Village stepped forth and memorialized: “In Ban Bamboo Village, there are three hundred hearths, and the people all commit evil, living wickedly and acting abominably, showing no reverence for Heaven and Earth.” Enraged upon hearing this, the Jade Emperor decreed: “Approved. Summon Envoy of Pestilence, Zhong Shigui, to descend to the mortal realm and carry out the decree, exterminating the entire village of Ban Bamboo.” Shigui received the decree and departed the celestial court for the mortal realm, where the Earth God received him. The Pestilence God said: “The Five Emperors, upon hearing the memorial, were enraged. They declared that this village, which does not believe in goodness, must be destroyed. I have been sent to descend and carry out the decree. Tomorrow at the hour of *si*, you shall place this medicine into every well, so that all who drink the water shall perish from pestilence.” The Earth God replied: “The people here indeed do not believe in goodness and deserve destruction, but among them is one man, Lei Qiong, who makes his living selling tofu. He is kind-hearted, constantly cultivates good roots, and is generous in almsgiving. He must not be harmed.” The envoy said: “The good man shall be spared, but none others may be shown mercy.” He then handed the medicine to the Earth God.",

The Earth God spoke from behind him: “Draw more of this water. Tomorrow at the hour of *si*, poison will be placed in it—whoever drinks it will die. Do not consume it.” Qiong turned to look but saw no one. Startled, he thought to himself: “If a divine being descends tomorrow to poison the well and destroy the entire village, how can I know of this and conceal it, preserving only my own life? Better that I die instead. If I can save the village, it will be my hidden merit.” The next day, as soon as dawn broke, he waited by the well to see if the words would prove true. Indeed, an old man approached, holding a packet of medicine, about to drop it into the well. Qiong rushed forward and seized it. The Earth God was alarmed and tried to snatch it back, but the old man swallowed it in one gulp. Instantly, he collapsed, his limbs turning black with pestilence. The Earth God, greatly shocked, carried the old man’s three *hun* and six *po* to the Heavenly Palace to see the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor, moved by the report, appointed Lei Qiong as Marshal of Majestic Pestilence. He was given a hat of the common people, a golden flower, and a golden plaque inscribed with the four characters “Unbound by Heaven or Earth,” allowing him to pass freely through the celestial gates and descend to assist the masters below. Lei Qiong thanked the Emperor and petitioned for the village’s pardon, which the Jade Emperor granted. Returning to Banzhu Village, Qiong appeared in the dreams of the villagers, urging them to reform and cultivate goodness. He then went to pay respects to his master. The master was overjoyed and led the group to another place—Shaanxi. There stood a mountain called Crimson Cloud Mountain, where a demon named Tian Wen dwelled, wreaking havoc. As the master and his company arrived, the Pestilence Marshal saw Tian Wen causing mischief and scattered the *Qiong* flower. Forged from the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth, its presence dispelled all malevolent forces, revealing only a jade cup and an iron tube. Lei Qiong captured them and presented them to his master, who was greatly pleased and bestowed them upon him for his use.\n\nLeaving Crimson Cloud Mountain, the group traveled onward until they reached a place called Spirit Screen Mountain. Within the mountain was a cave called Pure Seclusion Grotto, ruled by a demon named Shi Cheng. The demon wore a helmet like that of Erlang, his face pale with crimson lips, and wielded a thunder whip as his magical treasure, summoning the twelve earthly branches to aid him in battle. Deng, Xin, and Zhang arrived and, upon seeing him, hurled their own magical treasures. Shi Cheng, caught off guard, was captured and brought before the master. He kowtowed in submission. The master was delighted and wrote a memorial to the Jade Emperor, who issued a decree appointing him as Marshal of Divine Thunder and Stone, to follow the master’s command.\n\nThey journeyed further until they reached Gathering Tiger Mountain, where two demons lay in wait. One was named Wang Tie, pale-faced and wielding a long spear; the other was named Gao Tong, brandishing a pair of five-pronged axes.

Marshal Zhao cast his Fire Rope, while the white-faced Wang Tie hurled his Flying Spear, summoning the Divine Tiger of the Eastern Mountain to snatch at Marshal Zhao. Gao Tong then flung his Jade Axes, calling forth the Divine Tiger of the Western Mountain to join the fray. Marshal Zhao, unable to withstand the assault, fled in defeat. Upon witnessing this, Marshal Ma the Divine Official cast his Fire Elixir into the air, scorching the horde of demons until nine out of ten lay wounded, forcing them to flee behind their gates. Marshal Ma then cast his Golden Bell, trapping the two demons beneath it. They were seized and brought before the master, who rejoiced. He wrote a memorial to the Jade Emperor, who issued a decree appointing them as Marshal Wang of Tiger Hill and Marshal Gao the Second, to follow the master’s teachings.\n\nWhat befell thereafter shall be revealed in the next chapter.\n\n**Meng Shan Releases Prisoners onto the Daoist Path**\n\nNow, the prison of Guangxi Prefecture held many convicts. Among them was a jailer named Meng Shan, who served in the prison. One year, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, the prisoners wept bitterly within their cells, their mournful cries shaking the heavens. Meng Shan asked, “Why do you not weep on other days, yet today each of you wails so sorrowfully?” The prisoners replied, “Though we are not good men, we still hold a shred of filial piety. As the year draws to a close and we cannot see our parents, our longing grows unbearable, hence our tears.” Meng Shan said, “Your words move me to sorrow. I shall do you a kindness—let me release you to return home for the New Year. But on the fifth day of the first month next year, each of you must return without fail, lest you bring trouble upon me.” The prisoners bowed in gratitude, vowing earnestly before departing. When the first month of the following year arrived, they indeed returned and gathered, entering the prison once more. Meng Shan checked the prison register—all eight hundred were present—and rejoiced. From then on, every year on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he would release the prisoners to return home, and they would come back on the fifth day of the first month, ever grateful for his virtue.\n\nOne day, Meng Shan said, “If you are willing to reform and become good men, I shall release you for good—what say you?” The prisoners replied, “If you, Warden, are willing to free us, how dare we return to our wicked ways? Yet though you save us all, your own life would be forfeit—how could we flee?” Meng Shan said, “If you truly reform and turn from evil to good, I have a way to escape my fate. Do not worry for me.” The prisoners, hearing this, bowed in thanks and gradually departed the prison, scattering to distant lands.\n\nA month later, Prefect Teng Gongyi descended to the prison and found not a single soul. Shocked, he questioned Meng Shan. Meng Shan reported, “I released them, and they will return shortly.” The prefect flew into a rage, ordering Meng Shan to be flogged forty times and sent to retrieve the eight hundred prisoners. Bearing the punishment, Meng Shan took up a spear and left the prison. Arriving at a place called Tile Ridge Mountain, he planted his spear in the ground and sighed, “Though my superior punishes me today, I bear no resentment. To sacrifice my life to save eight hundred doomed souls—how could I regret it?” Just as he was about to impale himself on the spear, the Earth God transformed into a white hare and knocked the spear aside. Meng Shan lunged three times, and three times the white hare thwarted him. The Five Emperors, hearing of his plight, immediately dispatched the Floating Heaven Lord with a jade decree, appointing Meng Shan as Marshal Meng of Fengdu, to wear a commoner’s hat adorned with a golden flower, wield a Yellow Dragon Spear, and ride a cloud of azure. He was ordered to the northern lands to assist the master. Meng Shan entered court to give thanks, then paid his respects to the master, who rejoiced.\n\nThey journeyed onward until they reached a place called Chen Sand Land. There dwelled a demon named Yang Biao, who wrought havoc in the area, devouring people insatiably. Beneath the earth, he had dug countless pits; any traveler passing through at dusk would fall in, whereupon Yang Biao would seize and consume them. As the master and his generals advanced, they saw demonic clouds swirling, shrouding Chen Sand Land. The master said, “Ahead, demonic clouds rise—there must be a fiend within. Which of you generals dares to ride forth and subdue it?” Marshal Zhao charged forward at once, only to tumble into a stone pit, unable to battle Yang Biao. Seeing Marshal Zhao fall, the master was alarmed and strode forward with his sword to rescue him, only to fall into the pit himself. The Fire and Water Generals rushed forward and leapt in, carrying the master out. The Water General performed a spell, transforming into an inverse dragon that split the pit into a great river, allowing them to fight their way out. Seeing the pit collapse, the demon attempted to flee but was too late—Marshal Zhao seized him and brought him before the master. A jade decree arrived, appointing Yang Biao as Marshal of the Earth Spirits, to wield a warrior’s weapon and assist the master in his teachings. The master rejoiced and bestowed upon Yang Biao a Fire Elixir, which he consumed before joining their ranks.\n\nLeaving Chen Sand Land, they arrived at a place called Dragon Gate Stockade, where a demon named Li Zhailong had conjured a barrier to block their path. Marshal Zhu cast his Five Poisons Bag, capturing the demon and bringing him before the master. A jade decree arrived, appointing him as Vanguard Marshal Li, to wield a bronze hammer, wear a helmet emblazoned with the character for \"valor,\" and follow the master in vanquishing evil. Marshal Li gave thanks and paid his respects to the master, who bestowed upon him a Fire Elixir to consume.",

After departing Dragon Gate Grotto, the master arrived at Purple Clarity Cave, where a demon named Fu Ying barred their path. At his waist hung a magical treasure called the Demon-Illuminating Mirror—when tossed into the air, its flash would instantly daze all who beheld it. As the master and his company advanced, Fu Ying blocked their way. The generals brandished their weapons to seize him, but the demon hurled the mirror aloft. In an instant, the generals reeled, their vision blurred and heads spinning. Startled, the master charged forward himself, only for the demon to deploy the mirror once more. The master swiftly pointed his sword toward the south, summoning the fire of bing and ding to smelt the mirror, rendering it useless. Seizing the demon, the master accepted Fu Ying’s prostration and plea for surrender. He bestowed a Fire Elixir upon Fu Ying, who consumed it, then drafted a memorial to the Celestial Emperor. A jade decree arrived, appointing him as Inspector Vice Marshal, to follow the master in subduing evil.\n\nThe master then proceeded to a mountain called Mount Taibao, where thirteen demons wrought havoc, known as the Thirteen Taibao. Each year, they demanded twelve local children—six boys and six girls—as offerings, claiming countless lives. Their names were: Chao Wen, Wu Qing, Zhou Wang, Peng Gan, Fan Yi, Zhang Shen, Li Lu, Wang Li, Wu An, Liu Gang, Tian Neng, Shen You, and Zhu Li. Each possessed supernatural powers. When confronted by celestial soldiers, they needed only to strike their own bodies, and their foes would writhe in agony, easily captured.\n\nOn the fifth day of the fifth month, the Thirteen Taibao emerged for a leisurely outing, only to encounter the master’s company. Blocking their path, the demons met the generals, who charged forward to engage them. The demons struck their own bodies, and the generals cried out in pain. The Tortoise and Serpent Generals swiftly bore the master away, while Marshal Ma hastened to his aid. The master said, “Though I have escaped, these demons will surely pursue. What manner of beings are they, wielding such power?” Marshal Ma replied, “I believe only the Three Pure Ones can unravel this mystery.” The master and Marshal Ma immediately journeyed to the Three Clarities Temple, where they paid homage to the Three Pure Ones and recounted the events.\n\nMaster Miaole said, “These demons are no ordinary beings. Their progenitor, a deity now governing the southern and northern realms, is a man named Yin Gao. Only by summoning him can these demons be subdued.” The Three Pure Ones, having heard this, dispatched Master Miaole to the Water-Fire Mountain at the southern and northern border to seek Yin Gao.\n\nMeanwhile, Yin Gao was stationed at Water-Fire Mountain, guarding the southern and northern border, when the perfected one arrived bearing a divine decree. He promptly emerged to receive the visitor, who, after formalities, said, “The Golden Tower’s incarnation has descended to the mortal realm to quell the black qi. Upon reaching Mount Taibao, he encountered a band of demons he could not subdue and sought the aid of the Three Pure Ones. By their decree, you are to assist the master without delay.” Yin Gao departed the southern and northern border and accompanied the master to Mount Taibao, where two demons—Yellow Pennant and Leopard Tail—blocked their path. Yin Gao sighed, “You wretches! I have not called upon you for ages, yet here you are, stirring up mischief!” He immediately performed a ritual, exhaling a killing qi that suffused the earth with golden light, revealing his true form as the Great Year Star—three-faced and four-armed. The two demons, unable to flee, exposed their true forms: two leopard tails from within a spear. Yin Gao seized them and, with the master, proceeded to the Taibao Stockade, where the Thirteen Taibao awaited.\n\nYin Gao engaged them in battle, but was soundly defeated and returned to the master. The master grew anxious, but Yin Gao said, “Do not fret, Master. Though I could not overcome them, my teacher, Master Sa, resides in the Southern Heavenly Grotto. If I beseech him, he will surely subdue these demons.” The master replied, “If you have such a teacher, hasten to seek his aid.” Yin Gao took his leave and journeyed to the Mystic Teaching Palace in the Southern Heavenly Grotto, where he found Master Sa seated in meditation. After paying his respects, Yin Gao was asked, “Disciple, why have you come in such haste?” Yin Gao recounted the events at Mount Taibao. Master Sa said, “Zhenwu is the Golden Tower’s incarnation. I shall accompany you to assist him, for no other could succeed.” With that, he gathered his magical treasures and, with Yin Gao, returned to the master. Their reunion brought great joy.\n\nAt dawn the next day, Yin Gao and Master Sa advanced to the battlefield, their war cries shaking the heavens. The Thirteen Taibao emerged in full armor to meet them. Just as they prepared to employ their magic against Yin Gao, Master Sa sprayed a mist from his Water-Containing Vessel and cast two ropes—one white, one red—into the air. The ropes ensnared the Thirteen Taibao, binding them into a single chain. Their true forms were revealed: thirteen skeletal remains. Master Sa placed a Fire Elixir within each skull and instructed Yin Gao, “Wear one skull upon your head and hang the remaining twelve around your neck. You shall follow the master in his teachings.” Yin Gao accepted the command, and the master expressed his gratitude. Master Sa then took his leave, ascending upon a cloud.",

      "translated_text": "The Jade Emperor was memorialized, and his decree arrived, appointing Yin Gao as the Earthly Controller of Slaying the Malevolent Star, the Most Virtuous and Venerable Divine Marshal Yin, Commander of All Slaying Deities Under Heaven. Yin Gao expressed his gratitude and departed with his master. What transpired thereafter shall be revealed in the following chapter.\n\n---\n\n**Master Sa Subdues the Wicked King in Henan**\n\nNow, there was a Perfected One named Sa Shoujian, who practiced medicine and saved the people. One day, he arrived in Henan and came upon a temple called the Temple of the Overseer. The temple deity was named Wang E, who each year on the sixth day of the sixth month demanded that the local people prepare ten sheep, ten oxen, ten pigs, and ten jars of wine for his festival. If they failed, he would spread pestilence to harm the people. The village elders, driven to poverty, pawned their wives and sold their sons and daughters—truly a pitiful sight.\n\nUpon learning of this, the Perfected One set fire to the temple and burned it to the ground. Seeing the divine radiance of the Perfected One, Wang E dared not resist and fled. After burning the temple, Sa Shoujian departed for Huizhou.\n\nWang E then commanded his lesser demons to spread pestilence. Alas, in one village, nine out of ten households fell ill. At night, he appeared in the dreams of the villagers, demanding that they rebuild his temple. If they refused, he threatened to set their houses ablaze. The people lived in constant dread.\n\nOne day, Wang E went out and saw a family named Sun, whose daughter, a maiden of eighteen named Qianjin, was exceedingly beautiful. That night, he transformed into a young man and seduced the girl. After more than a month, Qianjin was no longer recognizable as herself. Her family was deeply distressed.\n\nOne day, the Patriarch arrived in Henan and sought lodging at the Sun household. Seeing Sun Shou’s gloom, the Patriarch asked, “We are mendicants, seeking shelter for the night before continuing our journey tomorrow. Why does the elder seem so troubled?”\n\nSun Shou replied, “It is not that I am displeased with your stay. I have a matter weighing on my heart.” The master asked, “What is it?” Sun Shou said, “I have a daughter, eighteen years of age, who has been bewitched by some ghost. He claims to possess divine powers, and this has left me deeply troubled.”\n\nThe Patriarch grew furious upon hearing this and said to Sun Shou, “This poor monk shall capture this demon for you, in repayment for your kindness.” Before he could finish speaking, a fierce wind arose, and in midair appeared a man nine feet tall, his face black as iron, brandishing a golden whip.\n\nSun Shou exclaimed, “That is the one!” The Patriarch immediately ordered Marshal Ma to engage him in battle. Huaguang received the command, wielding his master’s spear, and ascended into the clouds, cursing, “You vile demon, dismount and surrender at once! If you are brought before the Heavenly Court, you may yet live. Refuse, and your life shall be forfeit in an instant!”\n\nWang E flew into a rage and swung his whip to strike. The two fought in midair for over three hundred rounds without either gaining the upper hand. Wang E then revealed his divine power, hurling his golden whip into the air, from which countless whips rained down. Marshal Ma responded by tossing his golden brick. They fought for another fifty rounds, still evenly matched.\n\nThe Patriarch drew his sword to join the battle. Wang E, his strength waning, could no longer resist. He withdrew his whip and fled in defeat. Huaguang unleashed his fire chariot, fire crows, and fire elixirs in pursuit. The Patriarch pointed his sword, and the demon transformed into a streak of golden light, fleeing toward Huizhou Prefecture.\n\nThere, he encountered Sa Shoujian, who was performing a ritual. Seeing Wang E, the Perfected One grew enraged and declared, “This demon dares to appear here again!” He raised his command tablet, recited an incantation, and the demon could not escape. Sa Shoujian captured him and ordered a heavenly general to escort Wang E to the Patriarch.\n\nThe heavenly general brought Wang E before the Patriarch, saying, “This official knew you had descended to subdue the dark qi, so I have brought this general to submit to you.” The Patriarch was pleased. He gave Wang E a fire elixir to consume and wrote a memorial to the Jade Emperor. The imperial decree arrived, appointing him Marshal Huoluo Wang and bestowing upon him a golden tablet inscribed with the words “Loyal and True of Heart.” He was to obey the laws and follow the master’s teachings. Wang E expressed his gratitude.\n\nThe Patriarch said, “Your nature is most unyielding. Now that you have turned to goodness, if you do not change your former ways, how can you bear the words ‘Loyal and True of Heart’? Should your heart remain insufficient, the Jade Emperor will hold you accountable, and by then, regret will be too late.”\n\nWang E laughed heartily and replied, “A true man’s word can revive a nation. To know one’s faults and correct them is to be a good man. How could there be any hesitation? This humble general, having been taken in by the master, from this day forward, will accept no bribes and show no favoritism. If anyone follows my teachings, I shall protect them. If anyone extorts money from the people, I shall strike them dead.”\n\nThe Patriarch smiled and said, “Your words are just, but you must also take compassion as your foundation.” Marshal Wang respectfully acknowledged the command.\n\nThe Patriarch then addressed his assembled followers, “I descended from the Heavenly Court over thirty years ago. The dark qi across the land has nearly been subdued. Last night, I observed carefully and saw that only in the West does a demonic cloud linger, refusing to disperse.”\n\nHe turned to Marshal Zhu and instructed, “There remains a demonic cloud in the West that will not dissipate. Take the Five Poisons Bag and subdue it completely before returning.” Marshal Zhu received the order and set forth for the West. He cast the Five Poisons Bag into the air, but the dark qi could not be contained.",

      "translated_text": "Returning, they reported these events to the Patriarch. The Patriarch then went with all his generals, each casting their dharma treasures into the air, but the qi surged even more fiercely.\n\nThe Patriarch said, “What can be done about this?” He resolved, “I shall go and consult my master, the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy, to devise another plan.”\n\nHaving spoken, he went to see the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy. The Heavenly Worthy asked, “Why have you come?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied, “This disciple descended to the mortal realm to subdue the dark qi, and now it is nearly all gathered. Only in the West does a lingering black cloud refuse to disperse. My disciples and I cannot subdue it, so I have come to seek your guidance.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said, “That black qi is an evil star, now trapped within the heavens of the Buddhist teachings. It cannot escape, and thus is difficult to subdue. Only with the aid of a perfected Buddhist disciple can it be gathered.”\n\nThe Patriarch asked, “Where might such a disciple be found?”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied, “To the west, on Snow Mountain, there is a prince who practices with utmost devotion. He is the son of King Chu and has now achieved success. You must first go to Flame Lamp Buddha to receive the prediction and become a disciple of the Buddhist teachings. Then, entrust Flame Lamp Buddha to summon the prince of Snow Mountain. Only then can the black qi within the heavens of the Buddhist teachings be subdued.”\n\nThe Patriarch bowed in gratitude, took leave of the Heavenly Worthy, and descended to the mortal realm. He instructed Marshal Deng and the others to wait in the world below while he, accompanied by Marshal Ma, went to the West to pay homage to Flame Lamp Buddha.\n\nUpon seeing the Patriarch and Marshal Ma, Flame Lamp Buddha asked, “Limitless-Prime, you have paid homage to countless buddhas, and Marshal Ma is the manifestation of Mañjuśrī Tathāgata from the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss. Why have you come here?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied, “This disciple’s spiritual powers are meager, and I have come to pay respects to my revered master.”\n\nFlame Lamp Buddha said, “You are a disciple of the Wondrous Joy Heavenly Worthy and an emanation of the Golden Portal. Why would you bow to this humble monk as your master?”\n\nThe Patriarch replied, “To return to the true fruit, one must practice the Way of the Fifty-Three Visits.”\n\nAfter receiving the Patriarch’s bow, Flame Lamp Buddha smiled and said, “Disciple, though you bow before me, I know you have come because of the star’s qi in the West. For this matter, I must summon the prince of Snow Mountain, and only then can this qi be eradicated.”\n\nFlame Lamp Buddha then commanded Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra to go and fetch the prince. Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra said, “He is but a mortal cultivating the Way. How can we be certain of his attainment? How can we lightly summon him?”\n\nThe Buddha smiled and said, “Since you two do not believe, I shall transform something to test him, and then you will see.”\n\nThe two received the command and departed. Mañjuśrī transformed into an eagle, and Samantabhadra into a sparrow. They arrived at Snow Mountain, where the prince sat in pure meditation upon his altar. Mañjuśrī, as an eagle, swooped down to seize the sparrow, which fled into the prince’s embrace. The eagle pursued and, speaking in human words, said, “I was hunting that sparrow, and you have taken it into your arms. Now I must eat what you have saved. Will you offer your flesh to me?”\n\nThe prince replied, “If you are hungry and wish to eat my flesh, there is no knife here to cut it. Go and fetch a sharp bamboo, and I will cut my flesh for you.”\n\nHearing this, the eagle flew away. It then transformed into a tiger, chasing a white rabbit, which again sought refuge with the prince. Seeing this, the prince once more sheltered the rabbit within his altar. The tiger, speaking in human words, said, “You have saved it, and now I shall starve. You cannot save both.”\n\nThe prince replied, “The rabbit is too small to satisfy your hunger. Go below, and I shall fall to you.”\n\nThe tiger complied and waited below. The prince cast himself down from the altar. In an instant, heavenly flowers blanketed the earth, and a golden lotus arose, bearing the prince to the Western Paradise, where he entered to see Flame Lamp Buddha. After receiving the prediction and paying homage, he met the Patriarch.\n\nThe Patriarch said, “I beg you, elder brother, to accompany me below to subdue the demon. There will be a great reward.”\n\nThe prince replied, “This humble monk has only just entered the Western Paradise and possesses no spiritual powers. How can I assist others?”\n\nFlame Lamp Buddha said, “The Patriarch is an emanation of the Golden Portal. You may accompany him below to gather the black qi and return. It will not be too late to attend the sutra teachings in the Central Heaven.”\n\nThe prince bowed in gratitude and descended with the Patriarch to the mortal realm, where they met the assembled generals. At dawn the next day, the Patriarch and the prince arrived at the western frontier. The air resounded with their battle cries as they called for the demon to surrender.\n\nSuddenly, the demonic cloud appeared before them, and from within emerged a monk, who called himself the Iron-Headed General.\n\nThe Patriarch said, “I see you are tonsured and robed, with prayer beads around your neck. You must be one from the heavens. Why have you descended to the mortal realm, unleashing black qi to harm the people below?”\n\nThe monk replied, “I remain in my own place. You have come seeking me, not I you.”\n\nHe swung his iron alms bowl at the Patriarch, who met the attack with his sword. The Patriarch could not overcome the demon and was about to press forward when the demon, sensing the true qi, fled into the Iron Robe Cave. The Patriarch rallied his generals, and they pursued, tightly besieging the cave entrance. Each general cast their dharma treasures into the cave, but none could harm the demon.\n\nThe prince struck his skull drum, and the demon within the cave grew dizzy and disoriented. Stumbling out, he was seized by Marshal Li and brought before the Patriarch. The demon refused to submit.\n\nMarshal Ma said, “This wretched creature will not yield. Iron belongs to the metal class, and fire can overcome metal. I shall burn this wretch to death.”",

Instantly, he unleashed the Thunder Duke, who struck the two sisters dead.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the Thunder Duke saw they were melon seeds, not rice, and regretted his haste. He brought the matter before the Thunder Envoy, who said, “What’s done is done.

When I strike a person, you shall first release lightning to illuminate them clearly. To Zhu Beiniang, I give a skull and a fan, and you shall be called Moon Comet Lady, for when you strike, none can move.”\n\nThe two sisters received their orders without further remark.\n\nNow, the Patriarch arrived at Stone Thunder Mountain, where he heard the roar of thunder and saw flashes of lightning. He stepped forward and pointed with his sword, shouting loudly. All the Thunder Envoys emerged and, upon seeing the Patriarch, knelt before him. The Patriarch asked the reason, and the Thunder Envoys replied, “We brothers could not bear to part, so the Jade Emperor commanded us to undergo tribulation here.”\n\nThe Patriarch asked, “Will you submit to me?”\n\nThe Thunder Envoys said, “We brothers have no one to rely on, and we have heard that the Patriarch is the incarnation of the Golden Portal. How dare we not obey?”\n\nThe Patriarch, greatly pleased, said, “Since you are willing to submit to me, I shall enlist you as generals under my command. As you brothers cannot bear separation, you shall thunder in the south during spring and summer, and in the north during autumn and winter, thus preserving your fraternal bond.”\n\nThe Thunder Envoys, overjoyed, bowed in gratitude and pledged their allegiance. The Patriarch memorialized the Jade Emperor, who issued a decree: Zhu Peiniang was appointed Thunder Mother of the Thunder Department, and Zhu Beiniang was named Moon Comet Heavenly Lord. From the northeastern celestial realm, the Patriarch summoned Wind Master and Rain Master, entrusting them with the Wind and Rain Talismans to accompany him in his teachings. The Thunder Duke was appointed Great General of the Nine Heavens’ Thunderclap.\n\nThe Patriarch rejoiced. Seeing that the dark qi of the middle realm had dissipated and the people lived in peace, he led his generals into the Thirty-Three Heavens to pay homage to the Jade Emperor and report the events. The Jade Emperor was greatly pleased and granted the Patriarch a seat beside him on an embroidered stool.\n\nThe Jade Emperor said, “Now that the dark qi is fully dispelled, you may take your generals to guard the Southern Heavenly Treasure Virtue Pass. Do not delay, lest demons descend to disturb the lower realm.”\n\nThe Patriarch expressed his gratitude. The Five Emperors further bestowed upon him the titles Supreme Primordial Jade Void Master-Preceptor, Mysterious Heavenly Emperor, and Heavenly Worthy of Subduing Demons. He was placed in command of thirty-six heavenly generals, and every year on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he would descend with his generals to inspect the good and evil of the world. The Jade Emperor presented him with two cups of Golden Wave Celestial Wine and personally escorted him from the palace.\n\nThe Patriarch expressed his thanks, assembled his generals, and assumed his post. A grand banquet was held to reward the troops, and they took up their stations at the Heavenly Gate to receive the incense offerings of all beings. Thus, the Eternal Buddha was revered.\n\nThe titles of the generals under the Mysterious Emperor were recorded as follows:\n\nSupreme Primordial Master of Myriad Methods, Divine Merit and Wondrous Aid, Perfected Lord Xu;\nWhite Perfected Lord of the Eastern Sea, Bai;\nTeaching Patriarch of the Fruitful Strictness School, Primordial Lady Fu;\nMaster of the Cavernous Mystery School, Perfected Lord Xin;\nMaster of the Pure Subtlety School, Primordial Lady Wei;\nMaster of the Primordial Unity School, Perfected Lord Lu;\nMarshal Zhao, Commander of the Golden Wheel and Ruyi;\nGuan Yu, appointed Manifest Spirit Pass Marshal;\nYellow of Dragon-Raised Jade Field, appointed Marshals Gou and Bi;\nTortoise and Serpent, appointed Water and Fire Generals;\nZhang Jian, appointed Utterly Loyal Marshal Zhang;\nPang Qiao, appointed Primordial Marshal of Chaotic Qi;\nFu Ying, appointed Deputy Inspector Marshal;\nOrthodox Unity Numinous Official, Marshal Ma;\nZhu Yanfu, appointed Marshal Zhu, Punisher of the Unfaithful;\nGenerals Cui and Lu;\nLi Fulong, appointed Vanguard Marshal Li;\nYu Tian, appointed Marshal Yu of Subduing Demons and Dispelling Evil;\nDeng Cheng, Xin Jiang, and Zhang An, appointed Marshals Deng, Xin, and Zhang;\nRen Wubie and Ning Shikua, appointed the Two Guardians;\nLiu Jun, appointed Heavenly Lord Liu of the Jade Palace;\nLei Qiong, appointed Mighty Pestilence Marshal;\nShi Cheng, appointed Divine Thunder Marshal Shi;\nGuang Ze, appointed Wind Wheel Marshal Zhou;\nXie Shirong, appointed Fire Virtue Marshal Xie;\nShang Wei and Shi Kuang, appointed the Two Sages of Wisdom;\nKang Xi, appointed Benevolent and Holy Marshal of Integrity;\nGao Yuan, appointed Marshal Gao of Descending Birth;\nMeng Shan, appointed Fengdu Marshal Meng;\nWang Tie and Gao Tong, appointed Marshals Wang and Gao of Tiger Hill;\nWang Zhi, appointed Marshal Wang of the Nine Provinces’ Vast Rivers;\nThunder Duke, appointed Great General of the Nine Heavens’ Thunderclap and Fengdu Marshal Zhang;\nYang Biao, appointed Marshal Yang;\nYin Gao, appointed Celestial Marshal Yin of the Year Star;\nIron Head, appointed Fierce Iron Marshal;\nZhu Peiniang, appointed Thunder Mother of the Thunder Department;\nZhu Beiniang, appointed Moon Comet Heavenly Lord.\n\nThe Patriarch once more descended to the mortal realm to relieve suffering.\n\nNow, in the Yangzi River near Mount Wudang, there dwelled a water-snail spirit, a horse spirit, a snail spirit, and a bamboo-rope spirit.

      "translated_text": "Upon hearing of the Patriarch’s ascent to Heaven, the spirits stirred waves in the river, harming travelers and merchants, their grievances rising to the skies. The Patriarch, observing from Baode Pass, grew enraged and declared, “To cut the grass and remove the roots. I descended to the mortal realm for four years, sweeping away the dark qi. Yet these four demons still lurk in the rivers and mountains. Now, seeing me ascend, they dare to wreak havoc again. As the ancient saying goes, ‘If the grass is cut but the roots remain, new shoots will sprout.’”\n\nAt once, he performed a ritual, manifesting eighty-two transformations. Leaving one incarnation to guard Baode Pass alongside the marshals, his true form departed the heavens and descended straight to Mount Wudang to save the people. Arriving at the Yangzi River’s edge, the Patriarch worked his magic, summoning the Threefold True Fire to dry the waters. Seeing the river parched, the spirits rolled ashore—only to find the Patriarch standing there, wielding the Seven-Star Sword in ritual. At the sight of him, they fled. The Patriarch gave chase, and before ten rounds of combat had passed, all were slain. Only the snail spirit and bamboo-rope spirit escaped, their whereabouts unknown. Deeply troubled, the Patriarch returned to the celestial court, where he oversaw the marshals guarding the Heavenly Gate. He dispatched another incarnation to descend once more, stationing it at Mount Wudang to suppress the two remaining spirits and aid the people. Whenever official vessels faced peril on the river, the Patriarch would appear in midair, hair unbound and sword in hand, to rescue them. The dragon kings of the Five Lakes and Four Seas came to pay homage, while officials and merchants were frequently saved.\n\nA statue of the Patriarch was sculpted at the foot of Mount Wudang, and a temple was built to enshrine him. In a dream, the Patriarch instructed the people to craft thirty-six celestial generals, each wielding a demon-subduing Seven-Star Sword, treading upon a coiling serpent and the Eight Trigrams Tortoise. Whenever officials or commoners sailed past, the Patriarch would manifest to protect them, ensuring their safety. Those passing by the river would enter the temple to burn incense, and the sacred flames never ceased.\n\nIn the third year of the Yongle Emperor’s reign, the Yellow-Haired Tartars rebelled. The sovereign was alarmed and dispatched troops to meet them, only to suffer a crushing defeat. At the height of the crisis, a figure suddenly appeared in midair, sword in hand, accompanied by thirty-six celestial generals. They unleashed wind, thunder, and swarms of wasps, charging forward to slay the Tartar chieftains Dalicing, Dalihe, Gaomuer, and Dengjiahu. The Yongle Emperor, unaware of the deity’s identity, returned victorious to the court. He sent envoys to the Supreme Clarity Palace to summon the Heavenly Master Zhang.\n\nThe sovereign inquired, “When I clashed with the Tartars, I was defeated in battle. At the moment of greatest peril, a deity appeared in the sky—hair unbound, sword in hand, with a fair complexion and long beard—leading thirty-six celestial generals, accompanied by a tortoise and serpent, charging from the north to save my life. The Tartars were slain, and I returned to the court. I wish to repay this deity’s kindness, but I do not know which god it was. That is why I have summoned you today; surely you recognize him.”\n\nThe Heavenly Master replied, “The one with unbound hair and the tortoise and serpent is none other than the True Sovereign Emperor of the Northern Dao.”\n\nOverjoyed, the sovereign asked, “You say this is the Dark Heaven Sovereign. Where is his temple now?”\n\nThe Heavenly Master answered, “This deity attained enlightenment on his own, aiding all people. He rescues those in disaster and saves those in peril. Travelers on the river are all saved by him. The merchants long ago built a temple at the foot of Mount Wudang.”\n\nThe sovereign declared, “Even the common people know to repay kindness. My life and this realm owe everything to this deity. How could I forget? Since you say the original temple stands at Mount Wudang, I shall personally lead a procession there to burn incense and behold his likeness, building a temple to repay his grace.”\n\nHe issued an edict, commanding the civil and military officials, along with the Heavenly Master, to accompany him to Mount Wudang by the Yangzi River. The sovereign entered the temple to burn incense, and upon seeing the Patriarch’s statue—so like the figure he had witnessed—his heart swelled with joy. After the rites, he returned to the court and hosted a grand banquet for all officials.\n\nHe then decreed that General Jin supervise the construction, with the Marquis of Longping leading thirty thousand laborers and craftsmen to Mount Wudang. There, they built a golden hall, gilded the Patriarch’s statue, and erected thirty-six halls and seventy-two palaces. Lu Ban descended to assist, and within a year, the halls, palaces, and statues were complete. Generals Jin and the Marquis of Longping returned to the court to report the completion.\n\nThe sovereign was overjoyed and promoted General Jin three ranks. He selected forty-eight virtuous Daoist masters from across the land to serve as Daoist officials. The sovereign then ordered the Heavenly Master to conduct a seven-day, ten-night grand ritual, during which he would personally burn incense and pay homage.\n\nThe Marquis of Longping stepped forward and petitioned, “Your Majesty has now built the temple and sculpted the deity’s statue, fully demonstrating your sincerity. However, I fear that in the future, those who come to burn incense may lack the means to make offerings, and the stellar officials may go without sustenance. This is not a sustainable plan. I beg Your Majesty to bestow your boundless compassion and allocate funds from some source to ensure the eternal continuity of the sacred flames.”\n\nThe sovereign, greatly pleased, issued a decree granting five hundred *qing* of incense and lamp fields, along with one hundred *qing* of wheat and rice fields. Any damage to the temple was to be repaired, ensuring the sacred flames would burn for ten thousand generations.\n\nAs the sovereign prepared to feast with his ministers at Mount Wudang, a report came that a bell had floated up from the river, drifting ashore. The sovereign ordered it retrieved and brought into the great hall. It was a bronze bell cast from seven treasures, its sound carrying for a hundred *li*.",

The four seas grew calm, their waves stilled, and the people felt the grace of the deity. Filial sons and obedient grandsons who prayed for their parents, or those without children who sought heirs—none failed to receive divine response. His fame spread throughout the two capitals and the thirteen provinces, and those who came to burn incense and pray for blessings were beyond counting. The devout might find bolts of crimson silk drifting down from the heavens, draping themselves upon their bodies—a sign known as \"receiving the silken blessing.\" People from all corners of the realm, men and women, young and old, came in throngs, some prostrating with every step, all chanting the Buddha of Infinite Life.
