  "full_translation": "*The Master Embracing Simplicity’s Scripture of Divine Immortals’ Golden Liquor*\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Master Embracing Simplicity’s Scripture of Divine Immortals’ Golden Liquor*. Author unknown, likely composed during the Sui or Tang dynasties. Three scrolls. The upper scroll discusses the methods and efficacies of preparing the Golden Liquor’s cyclically transmuted elixir. The middle and lower scrolls excerpt *The Master Embracing Simplicity’s* \"Elixir of Gold\" chapter.\n\n**Source of Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Category of Miscellaneous Arts, Section of Divine Arts.\n\n---\n\n**The Master Embracing Simplicity’s Scripture of Divine Immortals’ Golden Liquor, Scroll One**\n\nThe Golden Liquor’s cyclically transmuted elixir is what the Great One consumes to attain divine immortality and ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Those who seek immortality yet fail to obtain this Dao labor in vain. The method is recorded as follows:\n\nTake twelve taels of superior yellow gold and twelve taels of mercury. Grind the gold in a crucible into filings and add them to the mercury, allowing them to harmonize. Should the crucible filings prove difficult to forge, use iron tools to hammer the gold into sheets as thin as silk, then cut them with shears into pieces the size of leek leaves before adding them to the mercury—this is the common method for gilding weapons.\n\nOnce the gold meets the mercury, it swiftly transforms into a paste. The gold turns white, no longer yellow. This may be done in a ceramic vessel. Wash it thoroughly with pure water ten times. Store it in a fresh green bamboo tube, adjusting the quantity as needed, but do not make it overly long. Add two taels each of realgar and saltpeter.\n\nIn ancient times, weights were measured by what is now called the Wu scale, which is in fact the Jin scale. Few realize that it originated in the Wei dynasty, instituted by Emperor Wu to reward military merit—where gold and silver were measured by the half-catty. When weighing this elixir, one should use the ancient scale. The same applies to realgar and saltpeter. Realgar must be from Wudu, with a color like a rooster’s comb, free of impurities. The realgar now produced in Mamén and Shixing Prefecture resembles it, but its hue is that of yellow earth rather than true red, and it often contains stone fragments. I fear it will not dissolve properly, its qi too weak to neutralize the gold’s toxicity. Good saltpeter is difficult to obtain; if inferior, it will fail to dissolve the realgar. Test a small amount first—if it turns realgar to liquid, it is suitable. If not, it must not be used. The method for dissolving various stones with saltpeter is found among the Thirty-Six Water Formulas.\n\nGrind the realgar and saltpeter with a thousand pestle strokes until they become powder, then weigh them. Seal the bamboo tube’s opening with lacquered wood, binding it tightly with silk at the joint to ensure no gaps. Place it in a cool, dark chamber for a full hundred days—no fewer. When the time is complete, the elixir will be ready; if the days are insufficient, it will not transform. Once set, do not invert the tube. Cover it with a wooden lid and place it atop a vessel. After fifty days, the mercury will be subdued by fire and cease to rise. This marks the point when the gold and water become mercurial water, no longer recombining—this is evident. The sage carefully observes these signs of transformation.\n\nIf the elixir is not subdued, continue heating the mercury for fifty days. When opening the tube, seal it as before, ensuring it is airtight. Otherwise, the elixir will escape, and all effort will be wasted. After a hundred days, all will have turned to liquid—meaning the gold, realgar, and saltpeter have dissolved into water.\n\nUse the gold water to boil two catties of mercury, then soak it in pure vinegar. The vinegar and mercury will separate, remaining distinct. Take fresh mercury and boil it again—this does not refer to the mercury from the tube. When gold remains in the bamboo tube for a long time, it separates from the mercury and becomes water, their colors and textures no longer alike. How do we know this? The formula below states: *\"Take one tael each of gold water and mercurial water and ingest them.\"* Thus, we know these two substances remain separate within the tube. However, it is unclear whether the realgar water also separates. If it does, its color should differ. If no realgar water is visible, it has merged with the gold. Gold contains toxicity, so realgar is added to neutralize it, while saltpeter is included precisely to dissolve the realgar.\n\nRefine the mixture over a fierce fire for thirty days until the mercury turns purple. Only when the mercury takes on this color should the process cease. Store the mercury in a yellow earthen vessel. This refers to removing the boiled mercury and placing it in a yellow earthen pot. The formula does not elaborate further. A *yellow earthen vessel* likely means a clay crucible. Those produced in Guangzhou, Changsha, Yuzhang, Linchuan, and Poyang are all suitable, as are the yellow earthen pads made in these prefectures—they withstand fire without cracking. Vessels from other regions resemble pottery and are unusable, shattering when heated. Southern yellow earthenware is also acceptable. Mix horsehair or river reeds with the yellow earth, pound them a thousand times, shape them into vessels, and dry them in the shade before firing to harden.\n\nTo use them, first coat the vessel’s interior with Six-One Mud. The name *Six-One* comes from the combination of six and one to make seven—a secret guarded by the sages. The method for making Six-One Mud is as follows: Take alum, halite, bittern, and natron, and fire them for twenty days. Then take equal parts of leftward-turning oysters from the eastern shore of the Eastern Sea and red halloysite, grind them ten thousand times, sift finely, and mix with hundred-day vinegar until it becomes mud. Use this to coat the yellow earthen vessel, layering it to a thickness of three to five *fen*. Dry it thoroughly in the sun before use.\n\nPlace the vessel uncovered, without any lid, as in the Nine Elixirs method. From dawn to dusk, the mercury will transform into cinnabar—this is called *Returned Elixir*. Mercury is originally cinnabar; when refined, it becomes mercury, and when mercury is refined, it returns to cinnabar. The elixir reverts to its original form, hence the name *Returned Elixir*. With a *knife’s edge* of powder, yellow and white are achieved.\n\nAll elixirs must first be tested by producing gold and silver. Only when gold and silver are successfully made may the elixir be ingested. Though this formula yields the Returned Elixir, it does not immediately prescribe ingestion but first speaks of achieving yellow and white through a *knife’s edge* of powder. This is to test it by producing gold and silver. Yellow represents gold, white represents silver. The immortals keep this secret, not naming them directly, hence the term *yellow and white*.\n\nHowever, the method for the *knife’s edge* does not specify what it is to be applied to. This is kept secret, passed down orally rather than fully recorded. Following the *Nine Elixirs Classic*, here is the method for testing gold and silver—merely a small trial. One *zhū* of Elixir Flower from the Nine Elixirs, when added to a catty of mercury, immediately forms gold. When added to a catty of lead, it does the same. Use this as a model.\n\nThe method is as follows: Take mercury or lead and heat it in an iron vessel until it boils vigorously for a long time. Then add the elixir and stir with an iron rod. Soon after, it will solidify upon cooling. The Returned Elixir refined in the yellow earthen vessel may be ingested. Swallow a dose the size of a small bean, and you will ascend to heaven in broad daylight, greeted by divine attendants and dragons and tigers. This Returned Elixir is first boiled with gold water to absorb its essence. Now, refined again, it becomes the Returned Elixir, unlike ordinary mercury—thus enabling transcendence.\n\nThe immortal officials descend, and the spirits of the mountains, rivers, and lands all become their subordinates—hence it is said they come to receive you. The divine beings all have the Azure Dragon to their left and the White Tiger to their right, their attendants earnest and reverent.\n\nFor ingesting immortal medicines, one must select the days when the Four Seasons are in their royal phase, such as the *jiazi* day at dawn, facing the sun as it first rises. This formula does not specify a set number of days—it seems one dose is enough to attain transcendence. Yet in the alchemical canons, there is a grade of elixir where the superior adept ascends to heaven on the very day of ingestion, the middling adept becomes immortal after ten days, and the lesser adept after a year. If one pill of this elixir yields no effect, take it daily until a change occurs. Once this elixir is ingested, one is already an immortal and need not consume gold water further. Whether to take mercury water depends on the practitioner’s inclination; if this elixir brings no benefit over time, one may then consume gold water or mercury water. Gold water and mercury water are inexhaustible in use—they merely require soaking in bitter wine.\n\nThe earlier mention of boiling mercury in gold water suggests using gold water from the tube, not mercury water. Here, it speaks of gold water and mercury water being used to their fullest, with mercury not being depleted, implying both waters are employed together to boil mercury and refine the Returned Elixir. These two waters can boil ten thousand catties. This passage likely advocates using both waters together—if gold is abundant, two doses may be prepared, each tested separately, lest insufficient gold yield uncertain results.\n\nThe discourse on the Divine Elixir concludes here. The \"ten thousand catties\" refers to boiling other mercury, not the mercury water from the tube. Moreover, boiling other mercury with gold water and mercury water immediately produces the Returned Elixir. These two waters do not deplete; when the bitter wine dries, replenish it—hence they can boil ten thousand catties in a single batch. After the medicine is complete, one may again boil mercury.\n\nTake one *jin* of the elixir and place it over a fierce fire. Use the water that has transformed other mercury to form the Returned Elixir. Simply heating it thus does not require a crucible furnace. Fearing the medicine might scatter, wrap the elixir in five or six layers of paper soaked in bitter wine, then heat it with charcoal. Dig a small trench in the ground to channel the flow into a shallow pit. Fan it vigorously, and the Divine Elixir will melt into gold below.\n\nUse a bellows to blow air, like the small leather tubes used by gold- and silversmiths to direct fire. The Divine Elixir will melt and flow like molten lead or tin. Its color is a true red, called cinnabar gold. When applied to blades and altars, it repels weapons for a thousand miles. Use it to coat swords and knives—apply it while the cinnabar gold is freshly molten and not yet solidified.\n\nFashion plates and bowls from cinnabar gold; those who eat and drink from them will attain longevity and never die. One may cast vessels and implements of any size by melting the cinnabar gold in earthen molds. For ordinary people who do not ingest the elixir of immediate transcendence, using such vessels in their meals will not grant immortality but will bestow long life. Those who attain transcendence become coeval with heaven and earth. \"Coeval with heaven and earth\" means they endure as long as the cosmos itself, thus proving their longevity—though they are not yet immortals, they will never die again.\n\nIf this plate is exposed to the sun and moon, it will gather divine radiance and sweet dew, much like the *fangzhu* vessel that collects water when exposed to the moon. If men and women eat from separate vessels, they will ascend to heaven immediately. These vessels, already divine, further absorb the radiance of the sun and moon, enabling their users to ascend as immortals.\n\nTake one *liang* each of gold water and mercury water. After fifty days of sublimation by fire, within a hundred days, both will transform into water. The ancients concealed this, arranging it out of sequence so that only the wise might seek it out. Drink it facing the sun at sunrise, and one will instantly become a golden being. In the past, Han Zhong ingested it and his body turned golden. Another scripture states that after ingestion, one’s face takes on a yellow hue—this is the sign of attaining the Dao, not that the body becomes hard and rigid like gold. The body will radiate light, and wings will sprout, elevating one to the rank of the Central Yellow and Grand Unity, who receive and transmit the primordial essence.\n\nThose who ascend as immortal officials of the upper ranks all serve the Central Yellow Venerable and the Lord of Grand Unity. These two lords are the sovereigns of the immortals. Ingesting the golden-tide Returned Elixir and ascending to heaven makes one a celestial deity who harmonizes yin and yang. \"Receive\" means to uphold, \"transmit\" means to enact, and \"primordial essence\" refers to the qi of heaven. This means that upon becoming an upper immortal, one becomes a celestial deity, assisting heaven in upholding and enacting the qi of the four seasons in their proper order.\n\nConsume half a *liang* of each gold water and mercury water. The ancient half-*liang* is equivalent to today’s one *liang*.\n\nTo achieve everlasting life without end. If the half-*liang* dosage is insufficient to ascend to heaven, it merely grants longevity and immortality. Further, blend the gold water and mercury with yellow earth, then refine them with intense fire for one day—all will transform into gold. If refined for two days, it will entirely become an elixir. However, when blending with yellow earth and firing, place charcoal at the base to prevent the yellow earth from turning into gold and forming the Returned Elixir. Once the elixir is complete, it should be dispersed. If one fears that gold mixed with yellow earth in a crucible might be refined into the Returned Elixir as described above, an alternative method yields what is called *Bi Xian* (\"Avoidance Immortal\"). Consuming it in the size of a small bean allows one to enter famous mountains and great waters, thereby becoming an immortal. *Bi Xian* means \"to avoid death.\" The texts state that it only enables avoidance of grain and longevity, not ascent to heaven. Thus, one enters famous mountains and great waters to become an immortal. Earth immortals become spirits of mountains and rivers, such as the Youth of the Eastern Sea or the Lords of the Five Peaks. Those who enter great waters do not literally submerge but rather take the great waters as their domain, akin to the Prefect of the Southern Sea. *Baopuzi’s Scripture of Divine Immortals and Golden Liquor, Volume One* concludes here.\n\n*Baopuzi’s Scripture of Divine Immortals and Golden Liquor, Volume Two*\n\n**On Divine Immortals and the Golden Elixir**\n\n*Baopuzi* states: In my study of texts on nurturing life and my compilation of methods for prolonging vision, I have perused thousands of scrolls. None fail to regard the reverted elixir and golden liquor as the paramount essentials. Yet these two arts represent the ultimate of the immortal’s Dao. If consuming them does not lead to transcendence, then immortals have never existed.\n\nIn earlier times, the realm was ravaged by chaos, and all fled in every direction. I traveled through the regions of Xu, Yu, Jing, Xiang, Jiang, and Guang, encountering hundreds of wandering Daoist adepts. Some were figures whose names I had long heard, men who dwelled beyond the clouds and sun. Yet they were nearly indistinguishable from one another—none possessed knowledge or insight profound enough to surpass the rest. Each carried dozens of scriptures, though few could fully comprehend them; they merely copied and preserved them.\n\nSome knew methods of circulating *qi*, abstaining from grains, or ingesting herbal medicines. Their manuals were largely uniform, and not one lacked the *Scripture of the Dao’s Mechanism*, which they regarded as the utmost secret, claiming it was authored by Yin Xi. I told them: This was composed by Wang Tu, a military supervisor of Wei in recent times—not an ancient. Wang Tu knew nothing of the great elixir; he merely sought transcendence through *qi*-circulation and chamber practices. The *Dao’s Mechanism* exhausts itself in this pursuit and misleads others gravely.\n\nWhen I questioned these Daoists about the golden elixir, golden liquor, the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, or the methods for summoning the spirits of heaven and earth, not one knew of them. Most boasted and praised themselves, deceiving others by claiming extraordinary longevity or past associations with immortals. Those who had mastered even the subtlest learning were exceedingly rare. Some had heard of the golden elixir but denied its attainment in the present age, insisting only the immortals of high antiquity could have understood it. Others possessed external explanations of elixir formulas but not the true scriptures, or they held fragmentary elixir methods and believed these encompassed the entirety of the art.\n\nLong ago, Zuo Yuanfang meditated in seclusion at Mount Tianzhu, where a divine being bestowed upon him the *Scripture of the Golden Elixir and Divine Immortals*. Amid the great upheaval of the Han’s end, he had no opportunity to compound it. Fleeing to the lands east of the Jiang, he resolved to entrust it to a renowned mountain and cultivate this Dao. My great-uncle, the Immortal Master, received it from Yuanfang. In all, he was given three scrolls of the *Great Clarity Scripture of the Elixir*, one scroll of the *Scripture of the Nine-Cauldron Elixir*, and one scroll of the *Scripture of the Golden Liquor Elixir*.\n\nMy teacher, Master Zheng, was a disciple of my great-uncle, the Immortal Master. I received the teachings from my great-uncle as well, but our family’s poverty prevented us from procuring the ingredients. I served Master Zheng personally, sweeping and attending to him for many years, until at last, in the mountains beside Ma’s Edge, I erected an altar, swore an oath, and received the transmission—including the oral instructions not recorded in writing. These scriptures were previously unknown east of the Jiang. They originated with Zuo Yuanfang, who transmitted them to my great-uncle, who passed them to Master Zheng, who then bestowed them upon me. Thus, no other Daoists knew of them. Yet it has been over twenty years since I received them.\n\nWithout the means to procure even the simplest ingredients, what can one do but sigh in despair? Those who hoard gold to fill their chests and amass wealth like mountains know nothing of this deathless art. Even if asked, they would not utter a single word. How could they?\n\nOne who has tasted jade dregs knows the insipidity of mere broth; one who has gazed upon Kunlun perceives the utter baseness of lowly mounds. Having glimpsed the Way of the Golden Elixir, one no longer desires to regard petty formulas. Yet the great medicine is difficult to obtain in full—thus, one makes do with lesser remedies to sustain oneself for the time being. Consuming a hundred measures of other drugs may yield slight benefit, but none can grant immortality.\n\nAs the *Oral Instructions of Lord Lao* states: \"Without the Returning Elixir or Golden Liquor, you labor in vain.\" Even the five grains sustain life—obtain them, and you live; be deprived of them, and you die. How much more potent, then, are the supreme spirit medicines, which surpass the five grains a myriadfold?\n\nThe Golden Elixir, when refined, grows ever more wondrous with time. Gold enters fire yet remains unmelting through a hundred smeltings; buried, it does not decay for all eternity. These two medicines refine the human body, enabling one to escape old age and death. This is but borrowing external substances to fortify oneself—like fat nourishing flame, allowing it to burn without end. Copper verdigris applied to wood keeps it from rotting in water; here, the strength of copper is lent to preserve the flesh. When the Golden Elixir enters the body, it permeates the meridians and nourishes the constructive and defensive qi—far beyond the mere external transmission of copper verdigris.\n\nMost in the world do not believe in the supreme Way; such are the idle and indifferent. Yet if by chance there arises one with the inclination, who never encounters this method, never meets an enlightened teacher, how shall they learn of such wondrous matters? I have here briefly transcribed the essentials of the Golden Elixir to show those of like mind among later generations. Seek diligently, and do not cling to shallow formulas, deeming them sufficient for transcending the world.\n\nThose who never encounter it must simply rest their hopes in boundless possibility. To hear of it is like emerging from filth to float upon the vast sea, turning from fireflies to face the sun and moon, hearing thunder and recognizing the crudeness of a drum, or seeing a leviathan and knowing the insignificance of a silkworm’s thread. How could one, with such paltry beginnings, hope to ascend? To seek transcendence with inferior medicines is like spurring a lame donkey to chase the swift wind or paddling a raft to cross a great river.\n\nThere are many minor elixir formulas, but their methods vary in depth, their potency in strength. Their efficacy differs as greatly as a single brew of wine cannot compare to nine fermentations of fine liquor. Even the least of these minor elixirs far surpasses the finest of herbal medicines. All plants and trees, when burned, turn to ash; cinnabar, when heated, becomes mercury, and through repeated refinement, reverts to cinnabar—so distant is it from common drugs. Thus it grants long life, and only the divine perceive this principle. How immeasurably remote is this from the understanding of the vulgar!\n\nThe world knows little and finds much strange. Some do not know that mercury comes from cinnabar; tell them, and they refuse to believe. \"Cinnabar is red,\" they say, \"how can it become this white substance?\" Or, \"Cinnabar is but a stone—all stones turn to ash when burned, so why should cinnabar be different?\" If such simple matters cannot be grasped, is it any wonder they laugh at the Way of immortality?\n\nThe true ones of antiquity, pitying those of later ages who might be taught, devised intricate methods to spare them the calamity of death—this was their utmost compassion. Yet the common folk refuse to believe, dismissing it as empty words. If it were mere empty words, how could the nine transformations, completed over days, all proceed according to the method? The true ones’ understanding of this cannot be sought through the shallow thoughts of ordinary men.\n\nI delight in the arts of the Dao, traveling far to seek and inquire, undeterred by distance. Each rare teaching I hear brings me joy. Though mocked and ridiculed, I do not take it amiss. Who knows if those to come may not surpass the present? Thus I write this to show those of discernment—not to indulge in the strange or adorn empty speech, nor to spread these words among the world and bind the俗 to belief.\n\nThe blazing sun cannot revive withered wood; the highest wisdom cannot transform the basest ignorance. Writings are transmitted for the faithful; affairs are valued by the wise. A farmer wielding a vermilion bow drives away crows; a southern barbarian, given a ceremonial robe, uses it to carry firewood. What can be done for those who do not understand?\n\nThe people of the world eat their fill all day yet scarcely apply themselves to the studies of the sages or the cultivation of virtue. They wander idly, frittering away their years. Their pursuits are but glory or profit—some chase game through the wilds, some linger over wine, some drown in beauty and music, some indulge in fine silks, some exhaust their sinews with the bow, some squander their time in gambling. Hearing the words of the supreme Way, they act as if drunk; reading the discourses on the Dao, they doze by day. They neglect their bodies, driving them toward death, unwilling to seek the methods of nurturing life. Instead, they carve away at themselves, sear and scorch, wear themselves ragged, and drown in dissipation.\n\nThe man of the Dao treasures his knowledge and keeps it secret, asking nothing of others—why should he force his words upon them? The world often says that if long life could be attained, the sages of old, who possessed both wealth and honor, would have achieved it. Yet none did, so the Way must not exist. They do not realize that the wealthy and honored of old are no different from those of today—both disbelieve and do not seek, both prioritize their immediate desires. How, then, could they attain it?\n\nShould one be unable to fully trust in fate, yet still wish to seek the attainable path of immortality, why hesitate to attempt it? Even a modest success—gaining two or three centuries of life—would far surpass the fleeting span of ordinary men. The affairs of the world are myriad, and the arts of the Dao are more difficult to clarify than any other pursuit. How, then, can one of middling talent presume to declare that the Way of long life does not exist? If we were to dismiss its possibility simply because most do not believe in it, would that not imply that the wise among men are far too few?\n\nNow, if one discerns the intent of the Dao and seeks it alone, must they truly be the most foolish, falling short of all others? Some fear that in pursuing long life, should they fail, they will be mocked as deluded. Yet if one’s own judgment is flawed and the Way of immortality does indeed exist, would they not then be ridiculed by those who have attained it? The sun and moon, though radiant, cannot illuminate every heart—how, then, can one rely solely on isolated belief?\n\nI have examined *The Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir*, which states: \"The Yellow Emperor consumed it and ascended as an immortal.\" It further declares: \"Though one practices breath control, guiding and pulling, or consumes herbal medicines to extend life, death remains inevitable. Only the divine elixir grants boundless longevity, aligning one’s years with heaven and earth, riding clouds and cranes to ascend and descend the Great Purity.\" The Yellow Emperor transmitted this to Master Jue, admonishing him: \"This Way is of utmost gravity—it must be entrusted only to the worthy. Should one be unfit, though their gold pile high as mountains, do not reveal this Way to them.\" The recipient was to cast a golden fish into the east-flowing waters as a pledge, swearing an oath in blood. Those without the bone of immortality could neither hear nor witness this Way.\n\nThe elixir must be compounded in a renowned mountain, in a place untouched by men, with no more than three companions. First, one must fast for a hundred days, bathe in five fragrances, and maintain utmost purity, avoiding defilement and contact with others. One must also prevent those who disbelieve in the Dao from learning of it, lest they slander the divine medicine and cause it to fail. Through this, an entire household may ascend as immortals, not merely a single person.\n\nYet the world neglects the divine elixir, placing faith instead in herbal medicines. Herbs and plants rot when buried, dissolve when boiled, and char when burned—they cannot even preserve themselves, how then can they grant life to men? The Nine Elixirs are the essence of long life, beyond the reach of ordinary perception.\n\nThe teeming masses, dull and blind, know only to covet wealth and rank—are they not but walking corpses? When compounding the elixir, one must also perform a ritual. The method and diagrams for this rite are recorded in the final scroll of *The Scripture of the Great Purity*.\n\nThe divine elixir methods in the final scroll begin with the first elixir, named *Dan Hua* (\"Cinnabar Splendor\"). One must first prepare *xuanhuang* (\"Mystic Yellow\"), following the detailed method for using realgar and other ingredients, as outlined in the final scroll.\n\n---\n\n**The Scripture of the Golden Liquor of Divine Immortality of the Master Embracing Simplicity, Final Scroll**\n**On the Divine Elixirs of the Immortals**\n\nThe first elixir is named *Dan Hua* (\"Cinnabar Splendor\"). First prepare *xuanhuang* (\"Mystic Yellow\"), using realgar water, alum, mercury, *rongguan*, salt, *yushi*, oyster shell, red halloysite, talc, and lead powder—each in quantities of several dozen *jin*. Form these into *liuyi* mud, then fire it for thirty-six days to completion. Ingesting it for seven days grants immortality. Alternatively, knead this elixir with *xuangao* (\"Mystic Paste\") and place it in a fierce fire; in an instant, it becomes yellow gold. Further, combine 220 *zhu* of it with one hundred *jin* of mercury and fire it for thirty-six days to produce yellow gold. When the gold forms, the elixir is complete. If the gold does not form, reseal the elixir and fire it again for the same number of days—it will invariably succeed.\n\nThe second elixir is named *Shen Fu* (\"Divine Talisman\"). Ingesting it for one hundred days grants immortality. When crossing great waters, apply this elixir to the soles of the feet, and one may walk upon the water. Taking three *daogui* of it causes the Three Corpses and Nine Worms to dissolve and vanish, curing all ailments.\n\nThe third elixir is named *Shen Dan* (\"Divine Elixir\"). Ingesting one *daogui* grants immortality in one hundred days. Even if fed to livestock, their mouths will never again touch wood or die. It also repels the Five Weapons. After one hundred days of ingestion, immortal youths and jade maidens, along with the spirits of mountains and rivers, will attend one, appearing in human form.\n\nThe fourth elixir is named *Huan Dan* (\"Returning Elixir\"). Ingesting one *daogui* grants immortality in one hundred days. Vermilion birds and phoenixes will soar above, and jade maidens will draw near. Combining one *daogui* with one *jin* of mercury and firing it instantly produces yellow gold. Applying this elixir to money or objects ensures their return the same day they are spent. Writing with this elixir upon the eyes of an ordinary person causes all ghosts to flee.\n\nThe fifth elixir is named *Er Dan* (\"Edible Elixir\"). Ingesting it for thirty days grants immortality. Ghosts and spirits will attend, and jade maidens will appear before one.\n\nThe sixth elixir is named *Lian Dan* (\"Refined Elixir\"). Ingesting it for ten days grants immortality. It may also be combined with mercury and fired to produce yellow gold.\n\nThe seventh elixir is named *Rou Dan* (\"Supple Elixir\"). Ingesting one *daogui* grants immortality in one hundred days. Mixing it with the sweat from a washbasin and ingesting it allows even ninety-year-old men and women to bear children. When combined with lead and fired, it becomes yellow gold.\n\nThe eighth elixir is named *Fu Dan* (\"Subduing Elixir\"). Ingesting it for one hundred days grants immortality. Carrying a piece the size of a jujube pit while traveling causes all ghosts to avoid one. Writing with this elixir upon doors and windows prevents all evil spirits and malevolent beings from approaching, and it also repels thieves, tigers, and wolves.\n\nThe ninth elixir is named *Han Dan* (\"Cold Elixir\"). Ingesting one *daogui* grants immortality in one hundred days. Immortal youths and jade maidens will attend, and one may fly lightly without the need for wings.\n\nOf these Nine Elixirs, obtaining even one is sufficient for immortality; there is no need to prepare all of them. The choice depends on one’s preference.\n\nWhen ingesting the Nine Elixirs, if one wishes to ascend to heaven, one may depart; if one prefers to remain among men, that is also permissible. All may freely enter and exit the realm of the immortals without harm.\n\nThere is also the Divine Elixir of the Great Clarity Palace, whose method was transmitted by the Primordial Lord. The Primordial Lord was the teacher of the Old Lord. *The Upper Scripture of the Great Clarity* contains nine chapters: the upper three may not be taught; the middle three are unworthy of transmission in the world and should be sunk into the depths of the Three Springs. The lower three chapters are precisely the three scrolls of the *Elixir Scripture*—upper, middle, and lower.\n\nThe Primordial Lord was a great divine immortal. He could harmonize yin and yang, command ghosts and spirits, and ride upon wind and rain, with nine dragons and twelve white tigers at his service. All the immortals of the world were subject to him. Yet he himself said that he had originally studied the Dao and attained his state through ingesting the elixir—it was not innate. How could a mortal man die?\n\nThe scripture states: The superior person who attains the Dao ascends to the heavenly offices; the middling person dwells upon Kunlun; the inferior person achieves long life in the world. Foolish people do not believe this, dismissing it as empty words. From dawn to dusk, they engage only in actions that lead to death, never seeking to ascend to heaven—how could they be forcibly granted life? Ordinary people know only fine food, beautiful clothing, music, sensual pleasures, wealth, and rank. Indulging their desires to the fullest, they are but fleeting beings doomed to perish. Take care not to reveal the divine elixir to them, lest they mock the Dao and slander the truth. Transmitting the elixir scripture to the unworthy will bring misfortune upon oneself. If one encounters a person of sincere faith, one may share the compounded elixir with them, but never lightly transmit the method.\n\nWhat need has one who knows this Dao for the rank of a prince or king? Once the divine elixir is completed, it not only grants long life but can also be used to make gold. Upon producing one hundred *jin* of gold, first perform a grand offering, for which there is a separate method—it is not the same as the ritual for the Nine Cauldrons. The offering must be made by separately designating the gold for each deity: twenty *jin* to Heaven, five *jin* to the Sun and Moon, eight *jin* to the Northern Dipper, eight *jin* to the Great Unity, five *jin* to the Well, five *jin* to the Great Turtle, twelve *jin* to the River Earl, five *jin* to the Earth Altar, and five *jin* each to the spirits of doors, windows, and the household—totaling eighty *jin*. Place the remaining twenty *jin* in a reed sack, and on an auspicious day during a bustling market hour, silently abandon it in a crowded place, then depart without looking back. Only after using one hundred *jin* in this manner may one freely use the gold. If one does not first offer gold to the various spirits, one will surely incur misfortune.\n\nIt is further said: The Way of long life does not lie in sacrificial offerings or serving ghosts and spirits, nor in breathing exercises or bending and stretching. The essential method for ascending as an immortal lies in the divine elixir. Knowing it is not easy; practicing it is truly difficult. If you can prepare it, you may attain long life.\n\nIn recent times, during the late Han, Lord Yin of Xinye compounded this Great Clarity Elixir and attained immortality.\n\nThis individual was originally a Confucian scholar, possessed of literary talent. He composed poems, eulogies for the *Canon of the Elixir*, and a preface, recounting his early Daoist studies and his teacher’s teachings from beginning to end. He listed over thirty acquaintances who had attained immortality through these methods—all clearly documented.\n\nThough this *Great Clarity Elixir* is a minor refinement, it is more difficult to compound than the *Nine-Cauldron Elixir*. Yet it remains the supreme method for ascending to heaven in broad daylight. To prepare it, one must first create *Flower Pool Urine Water*, *Golden Duke’s Yellow Bloom*, *Cinnabar Salt’s Mountain Snow*, *Mysterious White Flying Talisman*, and *Three-Five Divine Water* before kindling the fire.\n\nA single-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in three years.\nA double-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in two years.\nA triple-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in one year.\nA quadruple-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in half a year.\nA quintuple-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in one hundred days.\nA sextuple-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in thirty days.\nA septuple-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in twenty days.\nAn octuple-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in ten days.\nA nonuple-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in a single day.\n\nTo refine the nonuple-transformation elixir, place it within the *Divine Crucible*. After the Summer Solstice, expose it to the sun until the crucible grows hot. Then place one *jin* of *Cinnabar Child* beneath the lid, and wait attentively. When the sun’s essence shines upon it, in an instant, all will rise together in radiant splendor—resplendent with five-colored divine light—and transform into *Returned Elixir*. Ingesting a single *knife-point* of it will grant ascent to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThe nonuple-transformation elixir is also sealed and buried in an earthen cauldron, fired with chaff—first gentle heat, then fierce. Each transformation, from the first to the ninth, varies in duration. The fewer the transformations, the fewer the days required, but the elixir’s potency remains insufficient, thus requiring more time for ingestion and delaying immortality. The greater the number of transformations, the more potent the elixir, thus requiring less time for ingestion and hastening immortality.\n\nThere is also the *Nine Radiance Elixir*, distinct from the *Nine-Transformation Elixir*, though their methods are largely similar. To prepare it, first combine the various ingredients and refine them through five stones: cinnabar, realgar, white arsenic, azurite, and magnetite. Each stone undergoes five transformations, yielding five colors; the five stones together produce twenty-five colors. One *liang* of each color is stored in separate vessels.\n\nTo revive the dead who have not yet been deceased for three days, take a *knife-point* of the green elixir, mix it with water, bathe the corpse, and place another *knife-point* into its mouth—the dead will immediately revive.\n\nTo summon a traveling kitchen, mix the black elixir with water and anoint the left hand. Whatever is spoken aloud will instantly appear, capable of manifesting all things under heaven.\n\nTo become invisible, foreknow future events, or halt aging, ingest a *knife-point* of the *Yellow Bloom Elixir*—one will attain longevity and cease aging. Sitting, one may perceive events a thousand *li* away, discerning fortune and misfortune as if before one’s eyes. The destinies of all people—prosperity or decline, longevity or early death, wealth or poverty—will be known. These methods are all recorded in the middle scroll of the *Great Clarity*.\n\nThere is also the *Five Spirits Elixir Canon* in one scroll, containing five methods. It employs cinnabar, realgar, orpiment, sulfur, azurite, arsenic, magnetite, halite, *Taiyi Yu Yu Root*, *Six-One Clay*, and a *Divine Chamber*. After sacrificial rites, it is compounded and fired for thirty-six days to completion. Additionally, *Five Emperor Talismans*, painted in five colors, can also confer immortality, though they are not as potent as the *Great Clarity* or *Nine-Cauldron Elixirs*.\n\nThere is also the *Min Mountain Elixir Method*, discovered by the Daoist Zhang He, who devoted himself to meditation in a stone chamber on Min Mountain. His method involves smelting cold brass to fashion a *Square Vessel*, which collects *Moon Water*. Mercury is then placed over it to capture the essence of the sun’s fire. Long-term ingestion confers immortality.\n\nAnother method involves placing elixir in a *Realgar Copper Crucible*, covering it with mercury, and exposing it to the sun for twenty days. After refinement, ingest a *small bean’s* worth with *Well-Flower Water*. Within a hundred days, the blind regain sight, all illnesses are cured, white hair turns black, and lost teeth regrow.\n\nThere is also the *Master Wucheng’s Elixir*, which uses *Ba Cinnabar* placed in an eight-inch copper tray. A clay furnace filled with charcoal is arranged with three trenches, and the tray is suspended above. *Stone Sulfur Water* is poured over it, keeping it mud-like. Ingesting it for a hundred days confers immortality.\n\nThere is also the *Master Xianmen’s Elixir Method*, which steeps one *jin* of cinnabar in three *dou* of wine for thirty days. Ingesting it for a single day expels the *Three Worms* and all diseases. Ingesting it for three years perfects the Daoist way, and two jade maidens will attend, ready to serve and instantly summon a traveling kitchen. This elixir can also repel malevolent ghosts, vengeful spirits, and the misfortunes of the dead afflicting homes or construction sites. Hang it facing the source of harm, and all will be well.\n\nThere is also the *Instant Elixir*, which has nine variants, resembling the *Nine-Cauldron Elixir* but inferior in potency. Its essential method involves taking realgar, burning it, and pouring it into a copper vessel, which is then inverted over three-year-old pure bitter wine. After a hundred days, the vessel will grow red nodules several *fen* long, or five-colored *langgan* jade. Refining and ingesting it also grants longevity.\n\nIt is further said that mixing the first sprouts of *Cuscuta* (whose roots resemble rabbits) and extracting their juice to blend with this elixir allows instantaneous transformation at will. Combined with *Vermilion Grass*, a single dose enables one to ride the void and travel upon clouds. *Vermilion Grass* resembles a small mulberry or jujube tree, standing three to four *chi* tall, with entirely red branches and leaves. Its stem resembles coral, and it grows beneath cliffs in famous mountains. When cut, its sap flows like blood. If jade, the *Eight Stones*, gold, or silver are cast into it, they can be kneaded like clay and, over time, dissolve into water.\n\nWhen gold is cast into it, it becomes known as \"Golden Nectar.\" When jade or stone is added, it is called \"Jade Elixir.\" Ingesting it grants longevity.\n\nThere is also a method for obtaining *Fu Dan*: it is said that among the world’s waters named after cinnabar—such as Nanyang’s *Dan Shui*—there dwell cinnabar fish, perpetually red. On the tenth night after the Summer Solstice, one must wait for them; the cinnabar fish will rise to the water’s edge, their red glow illuminating upward like fire. Casting a net retrieves them, though one must not take all. Slicing their blood and applying it to the soles of the feet allows one to walk upon water and dwell long in the depths.\n\nAnother method, the *Chi Song Zi Dan*, involves taking the sap of thousand-year-old *Meng* and the juice of *Fan Tao*, mixing them with cinnabar, and placing them in a non-leaching vessel. Seal the mouth tightly with silk, bury it two *chi* underground, and after a hundred days, extract the juice from the red fruit of the *Zi* tree, blend it, and ingest it. This will turn one’s face, eyes, beard, and hair perpetually red. Was not the *Red-Bearded Master* among the *Zhong Huang* immortals one who consumed this elixir?\n\nThere is also the *White Stone Elixir* method: gather pine needles from precipitous cliffs, *Golden Chrysanthemum* flowers, *Xia Ling*, and *Xia Shen*, grind them into powder, and ingest with *Hua Chi* water to summon divine spirits. Alternatively, dry *Mulberry* leaves in the shade for a hundred days, refine them with honey into pills or powder, and long-term ingestion grants longevity and a light body.\n\nAnother method involves taking fledgling crows before their feathers grow, feeding them a mixture of true cinnabar and beef. As they mature, their feathers turn entirely red. Kill them, dry them in the shade for a hundred days, then grind them—feathers and all—into powder. Ingesting a *dao gui* measure grants five hundred years of life.\n\nThe *Kang Feng Zi Dan* method uses the blood of sheep, crows, and storks, blended with the juice of *Shao Shi Tian Xiong*, and mixed with cinnabar inside a pigeon egg. Seal it with lacquer, place it in *Yun Mu* water, and after a hundred days, it transforms into red liquid. Drinking a *ge* measure extends life by a hundred years; a *sheng* grants a thousand years.\n\nThe *Cui Wen Zi Dan* method involves placing cinnabar inside a goose egg and steaming it. Ingestion prolongs life, and long-term use confers immortality.\n\nThe *Liu Zi Dan* method requires soaking cinnabar in *Xuan Shui* liquid for a hundred days until it turns purple and can be held without staining the hands. Blend it with *Yun Mu* water, seal it in a bamboo tube with lacquer, and submerge it in a well. After a hundred days, it becomes red liquid. Drinking a *ge* measure grants a hundred years of life; long-term use ensures longevity.\n\nThe *Le Zi Chang Dan* method combines *Zeng Qing*, *Qian Dan*, mercury, and cinnabar in a copper vessel, sealed with talc and steamed in white sand for eighty days. Ingesting a dose the size of a small bean grants immortality within three years.\n\nThe *Li Wen Dan* method involves wrapping cinnabar in white silk and boiling it in bamboo sap to produce \"Red Spring.\" Steam it over boiling water, blend with *Xuan Shui*, and ingest. One *ge* measure grants a year of immortality.\n\nThe *Yin Zi Dan* method mixes cinnabar with *Yun Mu* water, seals it tightly, and places it in a *Jin Hua* pool for a year. Upon retrieval, ingesting a *dao gui* measure—consuming a full *jin*—grants five hundred years of life.\n\nThe *Tai Yi Zhao Hun Dan* method uses five minerals and seals them with *Liu Yi* clay, resembling the *Nine Elixirs*. It is especially effective for reviving those who have suddenly died; if administered within three days, pry open the teeth, place a pill inside along with sulfur, and wash it down with water. The deceased will revive, claiming to have seen messengers with tallies summoning them.\n\nThe *Cai Nü Dan* method blends rabbit blood with cinnabar and honey, steaming it for a hundred days. Ingesting a pill the size of a *Wu* seed three times daily for a hundred and one days summons a divine maiden or river spirit to serve at one’s command.\n\nThe *Ji Qiu Zi Dan* method combines clear wine, sesame oil, *Bai Hua Li*, and *Dragon Grease*, seals it with *Liu Yi* clay, and warms it with chaff fire for ten days. Ingesting a dose the size of a small bean—consuming the entire preparation—grants five hundred years of life.\n\nThe *Mo Zi Dan* method uses mercury and the essences of the five-colored stones, heated in a copper vessel with an iron spoon for ten days until it reverts to cinnabar. Ingesting a *dao gui* measure cures all ailments; long-term use confers immortality.\n\nThe *Zhang Zi He Dan* method combines lead, mercury, cinnabar, and *Zeng Qing* water, seals it, and steams it in red millet for eighty days. Mix with jujube paste to form pills, and ingest a dose the size of a soybean. After a hundred days, one attains five hundred years of life.\n\nThe *Qi Li Ji Dan* method first sublimes the five minerals into jade dust, blends it with cinnabar and mercury, and places it in a large copper tube to boil for a hundred days until it turns five-colored. Ingestion grants flight as an immortal. With a hundred *jin* of lead and a hundred *dao gui* of the elixir, smelting produces white silver. Blending with *Xiong Huang* water and firing for a hundred days yields gold. If the gold is too hard, boil it in *Chu* sap; if too soft, boil it in white plum juice. Consuming the entire preparation grants longevity.\n\nThe *Wang Gui Dan* method blends cinnabar with *Hua Chi*, covers it with powdered *Zeng Qing* and *Hang Huang*, places it in a vessel, and steams it for fifty days. Ingesting it for a hundred days summons the Jade Maidens of the Six *Jia* and Six *Ding*, who attend and serve, revealing all matters under heaven.\n\nThe *Zhou Hou Dan* method mixes *Jin Hua* with cinnabar, seals it in a vessel with dry tiles, and steams it for eighty days. The resulting dose, the size of a small bean, is placed in a dish and exposed to sunlight; its light connects with the sun. Ingesting a dose grants longevity. When cast into *Dan Yang* copper and fired, it transforms into gold.\n\nAnother method involves blending cinnabar with pomelo juice; ingesting it for a hundred days grants longevity.\n\nThe *Li Gong Dan* method uses true cinnabar and the waters of the five minerals, each a *sheng*, blended into a paste and fired in a cauldron for thirty-six days. Upon retrieval, mix with *Shi Liu Huang* liquid and ingest. After ten years, one’s lifespan aligns with heaven and earth.\n\nAnother method, the *Liu Sheng Dan*, blends cinnabar with the juices of white chrysanthemum, lotus flower, *di xue*, *di chu*, and *ling*, steaming the mixture for thirty days. After grinding, ingest it for a year to attain five hundred years of age; the elderly who take it grow younger until unrecognizable, while even small doses prevent aging.\n\nAnother method, the *Wang Jun Dan*, places *ba sha* and mercury inside eggs, sealing them with lacquer. Have a hen brood three such eggs, then ingest them on a *wang xiang* day to remain ageless for a hundred years. Children must not take this, or they will cease to grow. If fed to newborn chicks or puppies, they too will never mature—this holds true for birds and beasts alike.\n\nAnother method, the *Chen Sheng Dan*, mixes white honey with cinnabar in a copper vessel, seals it, and submerges it in a well. After one full cycle, ingest it to go years without hunger; consuming a whole *jin* grants a lifespan of a hundred years.\n\nAnother method, the *Han Zhong Dan*, combines lacquer and honey with cinnabar, then refines the mixture. It extends years and sharpens vision. After a thousand days of ingestion, one casts no shadow at noon. Beyond these, there remain dozens of other methods, not worth discussing.\n\nGe Hong said: The *Jin Ye* (Golden Liquid), which the Supreme Unity consumed to ascend as an immortal, surpasses even the Nine Elixirs. To compound it, take one *jin* of yellow gold by the ancient scale, along with *xuanming*, dragon’s marrow bone, *Taiyi xunshou zhong* stone water, purple-trailing maiden’s dark water liquid, and cinnabar transformed by gold. Seal these to form a liquid.\n\nThe authentic scripture states: When the *Jin Ye* enters the mouth, the body turns golden. The Old Lord received this from the Primordial Lord, who declared, “This Way is most weighty—emerging but once in a hundred generations. It is concealed in a stone chamber. To compound it, one must fast and abstain, shun all contact with the profane, and erect a purified chamber beside a mountain stream flowing east. After a hundred days, it is complete. Ingesting one *liang* grants ascent as an immortal. If one does not yet wish to depart the world but seeks only to become an earthbound immortal, a hundred-day fast suffices. To ascend to heaven, one must first abstain from grains for a year before ingesting it. Taking half a *liang* ensures longevity without death, rendering one invulnerable to all harm and a hundred poisons. One may then keep a wife and children, establish a household, hold office, and pursue desires without restriction—nothing is forbidden. Should one later wish to ascend to heaven, one must fast and abstain anew, then ingest another *liang* to become a flying immortal.\n\nThe *Jin Ye* also serves as the method for *Wei Xi Ju Sheng* (Majestic Joy and Mighty Victory). Take *Jin Ye* and mercury of the left flavor, boil them together for thirty days, then store in an earthenware jar sealed with *liuyi* mud. Place it over a fierce fire and heat until it transforms into an elixir. Ingesting a dose the size of a small bean grants immortality. With one *daokui* of this elixir, powder a *jin* of mercury to turn it into silver. Taking one *jin* of this elixir and fanning it with a fierce fire transforms it into flowing red gold, called *Dan Jin* (Elixir Gold). Coating blades and swords with it repels all weapons for ten thousand *li*. Fashioning bowls and plates from this *Dan Jin* and eating from them grants longevity. Drawing forth the essences of the sun and moon yields divine liquid, like obtaining water with a *fangzhu*, and drinking it ensures immortality. Mixing *Jin Ye* with yellow earth and placing it in a *liuyi* mud jar, then heating it with a fierce fire, transforms it entirely into yellow gold, which may be used for all purposes. Heating it again transforms it back into an elixir. Ingesting a dose the size of a small bean allows one to enter famous mountains and great waters as an earthbound immortal. With one *daokui*, powder mercury to instantly form silver. Mixing one *liang* of this silver with one *jin* of lead transforms all into silver.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Golden Liquid* states: Cast eight *liang* of gold into an eastward-flowing stream, swear an oath in blood, and then recite the oral incantation. Without knowing the original method, one who steals the formula and attempts it will never succeed. Only those of utmost faith may be given the medicine. The scripture must not be lightly transmitted, or both giver and receiver will suffer calamity. Heaven’s surveillance of mortals is close, though they remain unaware.\n\nGe Hong said: The Nine Elixirs are indeed the supreme method for immortality, yet their preparation requires an abundance of miscellaneous ingredients. If the four directions are unobstructed, these may be procured in markets. But if the nine regions are divided, the materials become unattainable. Moreover, when kindling the fire, one must tend it day and night, carefully regulating its intensity to avoid error—a labor of extreme difficulty. Thus, it is not as simple as compounding the *Jin Ye*. The only challenge in preparing *Jin Ye* is obtaining the gold. One *jin* by the ancient scale weighs two *jin* today, costing no more than twenty thousand coins. The other ingredients are relatively easy to acquire, and no fire is required—one merely places them in the *Hua Chi* (Flower Pond) until the allotted days are complete. The total cost amounts to thirty thousand coins for one dose, sufficient to immortalize eight people. However, if the quantity is even slightly reduced, the potency will be insufficient for transformation, like brewing wine from a few measures of rice—it will never ferment.\n\nGe Hong said: Next is the method of ingesting yellow gold. Though not equal to the *Jin Ye*, it far surpasses other medicines. Some refine it with *maoyu* or *qimu* and *qiwu*, or wear it in a leather pouch, or dissolve it with lodestone wine, or draw it out like cloth, or instantly transform it into water for ingestion. Some methods have prohibitions not found in the *Jin Ye* process. Combining it with realgar, orpiment, and the like allows one to stretch and mold it like leather—all these are methods for earthbound immortality. Silver and large pearls from clams may also be transformed into water for ingestion, but they require prolonged consumption and are difficult to sustain, thus inferior to the *Jin Ye*.\n\nGe Hong said: The *Jin Ye* and Nine Elixirs demand wealth and seclusion in the mountains, away from worldly affairs, so few can undertake them. Among ten thousand, perhaps one may obtain the scriptures, hence those who compose Daoist texts rarely discuss the golden elixir. The foremost prohibition is that skeptics and unbelievers must not slander or defame it, or it will surely fail.\n\nMaster Zheng said: The reason is this—when compounding such great medicines, one must perform sacrifices. During the sacrifice, the Supreme Unity, Primordial Lord, Nine Elixir Old Lord, and Jade Maidens all come to oversee. If the alchemist does not retreat to a secluded place, allowing the profane or wicked to witness the process, the gods will reproach the alchemist for failing to uphold the scriptural precepts, permitting evil tongues to defame the work. They will withdraw their protection, allowing demonic forces to interfere, and the elixir will not succeed. One must enter a famous mountain, fast for a hundred days, abstain from the five pungent foods and raw fish, and avoid all contact with the profane before attempting the great medicine. The fast must continue until the elixir is complete, not merely at the outset. Master Zheng said that Lord Zuo informed him: No minor mountain is suitable for compounding the *Jin Ye* or divine elixir. Lesser mountains lack true spirits to preside over them and are often inhabited by thousand-year-old creatures or blood-consuming ghosts.\n\nThese beings are all imbued with malevolent *qi*, causing alchemical compounds to fail. They bring no fortune to men, only misfortune, and delight in testing Daoists. Though Daoists may employ protective measures to shield themselves and their disciples, such entities may still spoil the elixir. Even today, physicians compounding fine medicines or salves avoid the gaze of chickens, dogs, women, or children. Should such beings violate the process, the remedies lose their efficacy. Moreover, dyers despise those who observe their work, and those with the evil eye may cause colors to fade—how much more so for the divine elixir and great medicine? Thus, the ancients and Daoists seeking to compound the grand elixirs of immortality invariably entered renowned mountains, never mere ordinary peaks, precisely for this reason.\n\nFurthermore, according to the *Immortals’ Scriptures*, the mountains where one may concentrate the mind to compound elixirs of transcendence include: Mount Hua, Mount Tai, Mount Huo, Mount Heng, Mount Songgao, Mount Shaoshi, Mount Wu, Mount Zhongnan, Mount Wangwu, Mount Nüji, Mount Difei, Mount Baodu, Mount Anqiu, Mount Qian, Mount Qingcheng, Mount Sui, Mount Yuntai, Mount Luofu, Mount Yangjia, Mount Huangjin, Mount Ao Zu, Mount Tiantai, Mount Siwang, and Mount Gaizhu. These mountains all harbor true spirits, and some are home to earthbound immortals. Above, they bear *zhi* mushrooms, and within, one may evade great wars and floods. Yet their purpose extends beyond elixir-compounding: should a man of the Dao ascend them, the mountain spirits will surely aid him in attaining fortune, and his medicine will succeed. For those unable to reach these mountains, the great islands of the sea may also serve for compounding elixirs. Among them, the secondary choices include Dongweng Isle in Kuaiji, Fen Isle, Yangju Isle in Xu Province, Shu Isle, and Guang Isle, as well as Yu Isle.\n\nIn the present age, the renowned mountains of the Central Kingdom are inaccessible, but in Jiangdong, the following may be visited: Mount Huo in Jin’an and Changsha; Mount Tai and Mount Taibai in Dongyang; Mount Siwang, Mount Tiantai, Mount Gaizhu, and Mount Kuocang, all in Kuaiji.\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity says: Though I am the descendant of great ministers, my talents are insufficient to govern the realm or manage affairs. Yet among my peers, many have soared to the clouds and shone in the celestial vault, surpassing my humble attainments. Thus, I have severed ties of mourning and celebration with my hometown, forsaken the glory of the present age, and resolved to swiftly ascend the famous mountains to complete the works I have authored. Next, I shall compound the divine elixir to pursue longevity. For this, the worldly deem me mad—abandoning my homeland, turning from the clear path, and toiling in the forests and marshes, my hands and feet calloused. They say I suffer from delusion. Yet the Dao runs counter to the world, and affairs cannot be pursued in tandem. If I did not set aside worldly duties, how could I cultivate such aspirations? When one’s vision is clear and resolve unwavering, what fear is there of slander or praise? How could discouragement or persuasion sway me? I record these thoughts to share with those of like mind in the future.\n\nI imagine that those who later form bonds of unbreakable fellowship will share my convictions. The formula for the Minor Divine Elixir: Take three *jin* of true cinnabar and six *jin* of white honey, mix them, expose to sunlight daily, and simmer until pliable enough to form pills. Consume one pill the size of a sesame seed daily, ten pills in total. Within a year, white hair will turn black, lost teeth will regrow, and the body will become lustrous. With prolonged use, the elderly will regain their youth, and one may attain immortality.\n\nThe method for the Minor Elixir of Cinnabar: Grind one *jin* of cinnabar into fine powder, then combine with three *sheng* of pure bitter wine and three *sheng* of pure lacquer. Simmer the three ingredients over a low flame until they can be formed into pills. Consume three pills the size of sesame seeds, twice daily. After thirty days, the hundred diseases of the abdomen will be cured, and the Three Corpses expelled. After a hundred days, the muscles and bones will grow strong and firm. After a thousand days, the Controller of Destinies will erase one’s name from the register of death, and one will be safeguarded by Heaven and Earth, gazing upon the sun and moon. One’s form and countenance will transform, assuming myriad shapes, and at midday, one will cast no shadow, for one will possess a radiance of one’s own.\n\nThe method for the Minor Elixir of Gold: Dissolve gold in clear wine, repeating the process approximately two hundred times, until the mixture froths upon insertion and removal. Knead it until it oozes between the fingers like mud. If it does not froth or fails to seep between the fingers, continue dissolving it in clear wine without limit. Once complete, consume a pill the size of a bullet. Alternatively, divide one pill into smaller portions. After thirty days of consumption, one will be free from cold and heat, and divine beings and jade maidens will attend to you. Silver may also be consumed in the same manner as gold. Those who dwell in the stone chambers of famous mountains and consume these two substances will ascend lightly within a year. Even if one remains among men, one will become an earthbound immortal. Do not transmit this recklessly.\n\nThe Twofold Principle Master’s method for consuming gold: Take three *jin* of *dufu* leather fat and one *sheng* of pure bitter wine. Place five *liang* of gold in a vessel and simmer over a clay stove. Insert and remove the gold into the fat a hundred times; do the same with the bitter wine. Consuming one *jin* of gold grants a lifespan coextensive with Heaven and Earth; half a *jin* grants three thousand years; five *liang* grants twelve hundred years. Regardless of quantity, gold may be consumed. Prepare and consume it on a day when the celestial stems and branches are in harmony, and the efficacy will be divine. Do not transmit this to the unworthy. Should it be shared with the unfit, the medicine will fail to achieve its potency. To cease consumption, take cinnabar.\n\nHere ends the second scroll of the *Master of Embracing Simplicity’s Scripture of Divine Immortals’ Alchemical Gold*.",

Those who seek immortality yet fail to obtain this Dao labor in vain. The method is recorded as follows:\n\nTake twelve taels of superior yellow gold and twelve taels of mercury. Grind the gold in a crucible into filings and add them to the mercury, allowing them to harmonize. Should the crucible filings prove difficult to forge, use iron tools to hammer the gold into sheets as thin as silk, then cut them with shears into pieces the size of leek leaves before adding them to the mercury—this is the common method for gilding weapons.\n\nOnce the gold meets the mercury, it swiftly transforms into a paste. The gold turns white, no longer yellow. This may be done in a ceramic vessel. Wash it thoroughly with pure water ten times. Store it in a fresh green bamboo tube, adjusting the quantity as needed, but do not make it overly long. Add two taels each of realgar and saltpeter.",

      "translated_text": "In ancient times, weights were measured by what is now called the Wu scale, which is in fact the Jin scale. Few realize that it originated in the Wei dynasty, instituted by Emperor Wu to reward military merit—where gold and silver were measured by the half-catty. When weighing this elixir, one should use the ancient scale. The same applies to realgar and saltpeter. Realgar must be from Wudu, with a color like a rooster’s comb, free of impurities. The realgar now produced in Mamén and Shixing Prefecture resembles it, but its hue is that of yellow earth rather than true red, and it often contains stone fragments. I fear it will not dissolve properly, its qi too weak to neutralize the gold’s toxicity. Good saltpeter is difficult to obtain; if inferior, it will fail to dissolve the realgar. Test a small amount first—if it turns realgar to liquid, it is suitable. If not, it must not be used. The method for dissolving various stones with saltpeter is found among the Thirty-Six Water Formulas.\n\nGrind the realgar and saltpeter with a thousand pestle strokes until they become powder, then weigh them. Seal the bamboo tube’s opening with lacquered wood, binding it tightly with silk at the joint to ensure no gaps. Place it in a cool, dark chamber for a full hundred days—no fewer. When the time is complete, the elixir will be ready; if the days are insufficient, it will not transform. Once set, do not invert the tube. Cover it with a wooden lid and place it atop a vessel. After fifty days, the mercury will be subdued by fire and cease to rise. This marks the point when the gold and water become mercurial water, no longer recombining—this is evident. The sage carefully observes these signs of transformation.\n\nIf the elixir is not subdued, continue heating the mercury for fifty days. When opening the tube, seal it as before, ensuring it is airtight. Otherwise, the elixir will escape, and all effort will be wasted. After a hundred days, all will have turned to liquid—meaning the gold, realgar, and saltpeter have dissolved into water.\n\nUse the gold water to boil two catties of mercury, then soak it in pure vinegar. The vinegar and mercury will separate, remaining distinct. Take fresh mercury and boil it again—this does not refer to the mercury from the tube. When gold remains in the bamboo tube for a long time, it separates from the mercury and becomes water, their colors and textures no longer alike. How do we know this? The formula below states: *\"Take one tael each of gold water and mercurial water and ingest them.\"* Thus, we know these two substances remain separate within the tube. However, it is unclear whether the realgar water also separates. If it does, its color should differ. If no realgar water is visible, it has merged with the gold. Gold contains toxicity, so realgar is added to neutralize it, while saltpeter is included precisely to dissolve the realgar.\n\nRefine the mixture over a fierce fire for thirty days until the mercury turns purple. Only when the mercury takes on this color should the process cease. Store the mercury in a yellow earthen vessel. This refers to removing the boiled mercury and placing it in a yellow earthen pot. The formula does not elaborate further. A *yellow earthen vessel* likely means a clay crucible. Those produced in Guangzhou, Changsha, Yuzhang, Linchuan, and Poyang are all suitable, as are the yellow earthen pads made in these prefectures—they withstand fire without cracking. Vessels from other regions resemble pottery and are unusable, shattering when heated. Southern yellow earthenware is also acceptable. Mix horsehair or river reeds with the yellow earth, pound them a thousand times, shape them into vessels, and dry them in the shade before firing to harden.\n\nTo use them, first coat the vessel’s interior with Six-One Mud. The name *Six-One* comes from the combination of six and one to make seven—a secret guarded by the sages. The method for making Six-One Mud is as follows: Take alum, halite, bittern, and natron, and fire them for twenty days. Then take equal parts of leftward-turning oysters from the eastern shore of the Eastern Sea and red halloysite, grind them ten thousand times, sift finely, and mix with hundred-day vinegar until it becomes mud. Use this to coat the yellow earthen vessel, layering it to a thickness of three to five *fen*. Dry it thoroughly in the sun before use.\n\nPlace the vessel uncovered, without any lid, as in the Nine Elixirs method. From dawn to dusk, the mercury will transform into cinnabar—this is called *Returned Elixir*. Mercury is originally cinnabar; when refined, it becomes mercury, and when mercury is refined, it returns to cinnabar. The elixir reverts to its original form, hence the name *Returned Elixir*. With a *knife’s edge* of powder, yellow and white are achieved.\n\nAll elixirs must first be tested by producing gold and silver. Only when gold and silver are successfully made may the elixir be ingested. Though this formula yields the Returned Elixir, it does not immediately prescribe ingestion but first speaks of achieving yellow and white through a *knife’s edge* of powder. This is to test it by producing gold and silver. Yellow represents gold, white represents silver. The immortals keep this secret, not naming them directly, hence the term *yellow and white*.\n\nHowever, the method for the *knife’s edge* does not specify what it is to be applied to. This is kept secret, passed down orally rather than fully recorded. Following the *Nine Elixirs Classic*, here is the method for testing gold and silver—merely a small trial. One *zhū* of Elixir Flower from the Nine Elixirs, when added to a catty of mercury, immediately forms gold. When added to a catty of lead, it does the same. Use this as a model.\n\nThe method is as follows: Take mercury or lead and heat it in an iron vessel until it boils vigorously for a long time. Then add the elixir and stir with an iron rod. Soon after, it will solidify upon cooling. The Returned Elixir refined in the yellow earthen vessel may be ingested. Swallow a dose the size of a small bean, and you will ascend to heaven in broad daylight, greeted by divine attendants and dragons and tigers. This Returned Elixir is first boiled with gold water to absorb its essence. Now, refined again, it becomes the Returned Elixir, unlike ordinary mercury—thus enabling transcendence.",
      "overlap_context": "thin as silk, then cut them with shears into pieces the size of leek leaves before adding them to the mercury—this is the common method for gilding weapons.\n\nOnce the gold meets the mercury, it swiftly transforms into a paste. The gold turns white, no longer yellow. This may be done in a ceramic vessel. Wash it thoroughly with pure water ten times. Store it in a fresh green bamboo tube, adjusting the quantity as needed, but do not make it overly long. Add two taels each of realgar and saltpeter.",

      "translated_text": "The immortal officials descend, and the spirits of the mountains, rivers, and lands all become their subordinates—hence it is said they come to receive you. The divine beings all have the Azure Dragon to their left and the White Tiger to their right, their attendants earnest and reverent.\n\nFor ingesting immortal medicines, one must select the days when the Four Seasons are in their royal phase, such as the *jiazi* day at dawn, facing the sun as it first rises. This formula does not specify a set number of days—it seems one dose is enough to attain transcendence. Yet in the alchemical canons, there is a grade of elixir where the superior adept ascends to heaven on the very day of ingestion, the middling adept becomes immortal after ten days, and the lesser adept after a year. If one pill of this elixir yields no effect, take it daily until a change occurs. Once this elixir is ingested, one is already an immortal and need not consume gold water further. Whether to take mercury water depends on the practitioner’s inclination; if this elixir brings no benefit over time, one may then consume gold water or mercury water. Gold water and mercury water are inexhaustible in use—they merely require soaking in bitter wine.\n\nThe earlier mention of boiling mercury in gold water suggests using gold water from the tube, not mercury water. Here, it speaks of gold water and mercury water being used to their fullest, with mercury not being depleted, implying both waters are employed together to boil mercury and refine the Returned Elixir. These two waters can boil ten thousand catties. This passage likely advocates using both waters together—if gold is abundant, two doses may be prepared, each tested separately, lest insufficient gold yield uncertain results.\n\nThe discourse on the Divine Elixir concludes here. The \"ten thousand catties\" refers to boiling other mercury, not the mercury water from the tube. Moreover, boiling other mercury with gold water and mercury water immediately produces the Returned Elixir. These two waters do not deplete; when the bitter wine dries, replenish it—hence they can boil ten thousand catties in a single batch. After the medicine is complete, one may again boil mercury.\n\nTake one *jin* of the elixir and place it over a fierce fire. Use the water that has transformed other mercury to form the Returned Elixir. Simply heating it thus does not require a crucible furnace. Fearing the medicine might scatter, wrap the elixir in five or six layers of paper soaked in bitter wine, then heat it with charcoal. Dig a small trench in the ground to channel the flow into a shallow pit. Fan it vigorously, and the Divine Elixir will melt into gold below.\n\nUse a bellows to blow air, like the small leather tubes used by gold- and silversmiths to direct fire. The Divine Elixir will melt and flow like molten lead or tin. Its color is a true red, called cinnabar gold. When applied to blades and altars, it repels weapons for a thousand miles. Use it to coat swords and knives—apply it while the cinnabar gold is freshly molten and not yet solidified.\n\nFashion plates and bowls from cinnabar gold; those who eat and drink from them will attain longevity and never die. One may cast vessels and implements of any size by melting the cinnabar gold in earthen molds. For ordinary people who do not ingest the elixir of immediate transcendence, using such vessels in their meals will not grant immortality but will bestow long life. Those who attain transcendence become coeval with heaven and earth. \"Coeval with heaven and earth\" means they endure as long as the cosmos itself, thus proving their longevity—though they are not yet immortals, they will never die again.\n\nIf this plate is exposed to the sun and moon, it will gather divine radiance and sweet dew, much like the *fangzhu* vessel that collects water when exposed to the moon. If men and women eat from separate vessels, they will ascend to heaven immediately. These vessels, already divine, further absorb the radiance of the sun and moon, enabling their users to ascend as immortals.\n\nTake one *liang* each of gold water and mercury water. After fifty days of sublimation by fire, within a hundred days, both will transform into water. The ancients concealed this, arranging it out of sequence so that only the wise might seek it out. Drink it facing the sun at sunrise, and one will instantly become a golden being. In the past, Han Zhong ingested it and his body turned golden. Another scripture states that after ingestion, one’s face takes on a yellow hue—this is the sign of attaining the Dao, not that the body becomes hard and rigid like gold. The body will radiate light, and wings will sprout, elevating one to the rank of the Central Yellow and Grand Unity, who receive and transmit the primordial essence.\n\nThose who ascend as immortal officials of the upper ranks all serve the Central Yellow Venerable and the Lord of Grand Unity. These two lords are the sovereigns of the immortals. Ingesting the golden-tide Returned Elixir and ascending to heaven makes one a celestial deity who harmonizes yin and yang. \"Receive\" means to uphold, \"transmit\" means to enact, and \"primordial essence\" refers to the qi of heaven. This means that upon becoming an upper immortal, one becomes a celestial deity, assisting heaven in upholding and enacting the qi of the four seasons in their proper order.\n\nConsume half a *liang* of each gold water and mercury water. The ancient half-*liang* is equivalent to today’s one *liang*.",

None fail to regard the reverted elixir and golden liquor as the paramount essentials. Yet these two arts represent the ultimate of the immortal’s Dao. If consuming them does not lead to transcendence, then immortals have never existed.\n\nIn earlier times, the realm was ravaged by chaos, and all fled in every direction. I traveled through the regions of Xu, Yu, Jing, Xiang, Jiang, and Guang, encountering hundreds of wandering Daoist adepts. Some were figures whose names I had long heard, men who dwelled beyond the clouds and sun. Yet they were nearly indistinguishable from one another—none possessed knowledge or insight profound enough to surpass the rest. Each carried dozens of scriptures, though few could fully comprehend them; they merely copied and preserved them.\n\nSome knew methods of circulating *qi*, abstaining from grains, or ingesting herbal medicines. Their manuals were largely uniform, and not one lacked the *Scripture of the Dao’s Mechanism*, which they regarded as the utmost secret, claiming it was authored by Yin Xi. I told them: This was composed by Wang Tu, a military supervisor of Wei in recent times—not an ancient. Wang Tu knew nothing of the great elixir; he merely sought transcendence through *qi*-circulation and chamber practices. The *Dao’s Mechanism* exhausts itself in this pursuit and misleads others gravely.\n\nWhen I questioned these Daoists about the golden elixir, golden liquor, the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, or the methods for summoning the spirits of heaven and earth, not one knew of them. Most boasted and praised themselves, deceiving others by claiming extraordinary longevity or past associations with immortals. Those who had mastered even the subtlest learning were exceedingly rare. Some had heard of the golden elixir but denied its attainment in the present age, insisting only the immortals of high antiquity could have understood it. Others possessed external explanations of elixir formulas but not the true scriptures, or they held fragmentary elixir methods and believed these encompassed the entirety of the art.\n\nLong ago, Zuo Yuanfang meditated in seclusion at Mount Tianzhu, where a divine being bestowed upon him the *Scripture of the Golden Elixir and Divine Immortals*. Amid the great upheaval of the Han’s end, he had no opportunity to compound it. Fleeing to the lands east of the Jiang, he resolved to entrust it to a renowned mountain and cultivate this Dao. My great-uncle, the Immortal Master, received it from Yuanfang. In all, he was given three scrolls of the *Great Clarity Scripture of the Elixir*, one scroll of the *Scripture of the Nine-Cauldron Elixir*, and one scroll of the *Scripture of the Golden Liquor Elixir*.\n\nMy teacher, Master Zheng, was a disciple of my great-uncle, the Immortal Master. I received the teachings from my great-uncle as well, but our family’s poverty prevented us from procuring the ingredients. I served Master Zheng personally, sweeping and attending to him for many years, until at last, in the mountains beside Ma’s Edge, I erected an altar, swore an oath, and received the transmission—including the oral instructions not recorded in writing. These scriptures were previously unknown east of the Jiang. They originated with Zuo Yuanfang, who transmitted them to my great-uncle, who passed them to Master Zheng, who then bestowed them upon me. Thus, no other Daoists knew of them. Yet it has been over twenty years since I received them.",

      "translated_text": "Without the means to procure even the simplest ingredients, what can one do but sigh in despair? Those who hoard gold to fill their chests and amass wealth like mountains know nothing of this deathless art. Even if asked, they would not utter a single word. How could they?\n\nOne who has tasted jade dregs knows the insipidity of mere broth; one who has gazed upon Kunlun perceives the utter baseness of lowly mounds. Having glimpsed the Way of the Golden Elixir, one no longer desires to regard petty formulas. Yet the great medicine is difficult to obtain in full—thus, one makes do with lesser remedies to sustain oneself for the time being. Consuming a hundred measures of other drugs may yield slight benefit, but none can grant immortality.\n\nAs the *Oral Instructions of Lord Lao* states: \"Without the Returning Elixir or Golden Liquor, you labor in vain.\" Even the five grains sustain life—obtain them, and you live; be deprived of them, and you die. How much more potent, then, are the supreme spirit medicines, which surpass the five grains a myriadfold?\n\nThe Golden Elixir, when refined, grows ever more wondrous with time. Gold enters fire yet remains unmelting through a hundred smeltings; buried, it does not decay for all eternity. These two medicines refine the human body, enabling one to escape old age and death. This is but borrowing external substances to fortify oneself—like fat nourishing flame, allowing it to burn without end. Copper verdigris applied to wood keeps it from rotting in water; here, the strength of copper is lent to preserve the flesh. When the Golden Elixir enters the body, it permeates the meridians and nourishes the constructive and defensive qi—far beyond the mere external transmission of copper verdigris.\n\nMost in the world do not believe in the supreme Way; such are the idle and indifferent. Yet if by chance there arises one with the inclination, who never encounters this method, never meets an enlightened teacher, how shall they learn of such wondrous matters? I have here briefly transcribed the essentials of the Golden Elixir to show those of like mind among later generations. Seek diligently, and do not cling to shallow formulas, deeming them sufficient for transcending the world.\n\nThose who never encounter it must simply rest their hopes in boundless possibility. To hear of it is like emerging from filth to float upon the vast sea, turning from fireflies to face the sun and moon, hearing thunder and recognizing the crudeness of a drum, or seeing a leviathan and knowing the insignificance of a silkworm’s thread. How could one, with such paltry beginnings, hope to ascend? To seek transcendence with inferior medicines is like spurring a lame donkey to chase the swift wind or paddling a raft to cross a great river.\n\nThere are many minor elixir formulas, but their methods vary in depth, their potency in strength. Their efficacy differs as greatly as a single brew of wine cannot compare to nine fermentations of fine liquor. Even the least of these minor elixirs far surpasses the finest of herbal medicines. All plants and trees, when burned, turn to ash; cinnabar, when heated, becomes mercury, and through repeated refinement, reverts to cinnabar—so distant is it from common drugs. Thus it grants long life, and only the divine perceive this principle. How immeasurably remote is this from the understanding of the vulgar!\n\nThe world knows little and finds much strange. Some do not know that mercury comes from cinnabar; tell them, and they refuse to believe. \"Cinnabar is red,\" they say, \"how can it become this white substance?\" Or, \"Cinnabar is but a stone—all stones turn to ash when burned, so why should cinnabar be different?\" If such simple matters cannot be grasped, is it any wonder they laugh at the Way of immortality?\n\nThe true ones of antiquity, pitying those of later ages who might be taught, devised intricate methods to spare them the calamity of death—this was their utmost compassion. Yet the common folk refuse to believe, dismissing it as empty words. If it were mere empty words, how could the nine transformations, completed over days, all proceed according to the method? The true ones’ understanding of this cannot be sought through the shallow thoughts of ordinary men.\n\nI delight in the arts of the Dao, traveling far to seek and inquire, undeterred by distance. Each rare teaching I hear brings me joy. Though mocked and ridiculed, I do not take it amiss. Who knows if those to come may not surpass the present? Thus I write this to show those of discernment—not to indulge in the strange or adorn empty speech, nor to spread these words among the world and bind the俗 to belief.\n\nThe blazing sun cannot revive withered wood; the highest wisdom cannot transform the basest ignorance. Writings are transmitted for the faithful; affairs are valued by the wise. A farmer wielding a vermilion bow drives away crows; a southern barbarian, given a ceremonial robe, uses it to carry firewood. What can be done for those who do not understand?\n\nThe people of the world eat their fill all day yet scarcely apply themselves to the studies of the sages or the cultivation of virtue. They wander idly, frittering away their years. Their pursuits are but glory or profit—some chase game through the wilds, some linger over wine, some drown in beauty and music, some indulge in fine silks, some exhaust their sinews with the bow, some squander their time in gambling. Hearing the words of the supreme Way, they act as if drunk; reading the discourses on the Dao, they doze by day. They neglect their bodies, driving them toward death, unwilling to seek the methods of nurturing life. Instead, they carve away at themselves, sear and scorch, wear themselves ragged, and drown in dissipation.\n\nThe man of the Dao treasures his knowledge and keeps it secret, asking nothing of others—why should he force his words upon them? The world often says that if long life could be attained, the sages of old, who possessed both wealth and honor, would have achieved it. Yet none did, so the Way must not exist. They do not realize that the wealthy and honored of old are no different from those of today—both disbelieve and do not seek, both prioritize their immediate desires. How, then, could they attain it?",

      "translated_text": "Should one be unable to fully trust in fate, yet still wish to seek the attainable path of immortality, why hesitate to attempt it? Even a modest success—gaining two or three centuries of life—would far surpass the fleeting span of ordinary men. The affairs of the world are myriad, and the arts of the Dao are more difficult to clarify than any other pursuit. How, then, can one of middling talent presume to declare that the Way of long life does not exist? If we were to dismiss its possibility simply because most do not believe in it, would that not imply that the wise among men are far too few?\n\nNow, if one discerns the intent of the Dao and seeks it alone, must they truly be the most foolish, falling short of all others? Some fear that in pursuing long life, should they fail, they will be mocked as deluded. Yet if one’s own judgment is flawed and the Way of immortality does indeed exist, would they not then be ridiculed by those who have attained it? The sun and moon, though radiant, cannot illuminate every heart—how, then, can one rely solely on isolated belief?\n\nI have examined *The Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Nine Cauldrons Divine Elixir*, which states: \"The Yellow Emperor consumed it and ascended as an immortal.\" It further declares: \"Though one practices breath control, guiding and pulling, or consumes herbal medicines to extend life, death remains inevitable. Only the divine elixir grants boundless longevity, aligning one’s years with heaven and earth, riding clouds and cranes to ascend and descend the Great Purity.\" The Yellow Emperor transmitted this to Master Jue, admonishing him: \"This Way is of utmost gravity—it must be entrusted only to the worthy. Should one be unfit, though their gold pile high as mountains, do not reveal this Way to them.\" The recipient was to cast a golden fish into the east-flowing waters as a pledge, swearing an oath in blood. Those without the bone of immortality could neither hear nor witness this Way.\n\nThe elixir must be compounded in a renowned mountain, in a place untouched by men, with no more than three companions. First, one must fast for a hundred days, bathe in five fragrances, and maintain utmost purity, avoiding defilement and contact with others. One must also prevent those who disbelieve in the Dao from learning of it, lest they slander the divine medicine and cause it to fail. Through this, an entire household may ascend as immortals, not merely a single person.\n\nYet the world neglects the divine elixir, placing faith instead in herbal medicines. Herbs and plants rot when buried, dissolve when boiled, and char when burned—they cannot even preserve themselves, how then can they grant life to men? The Nine Elixirs are the essence of long life, beyond the reach of ordinary perception.\n\nThe teeming masses, dull and blind, know only to covet wealth and rank—are they not but walking corpses? When compounding the elixir, one must also perform a ritual. The method and diagrams for this rite are recorded in the final scroll of *The Scripture of the Great Purity*.",

      "translated_text": "The divine elixir methods in the final scroll begin with the first elixir, named *Dan Hua* (\"Cinnabar Splendor\"). One must first prepare *xuanhuang* (\"Mystic Yellow\"), following the detailed method for using realgar and other ingredients, as outlined in the final scroll.\n\n---\n\n**The Scripture of the Golden Liquor of Divine Immortality of the Master Embracing Simplicity, Final Scroll**\n**On the Divine Elixirs of the Immortals**\n\nThe first elixir is named *Dan Hua* (\"Cinnabar Splendor\"). First prepare *xuanhuang* (\"Mystic Yellow\"), using realgar water, alum, mercury, *rongguan*, salt, *yushi*, oyster shell, red halloysite, talc, and lead powder—each in quantities of several dozen *jin*. Form these into *liuyi* mud, then fire it for thirty-six days to completion. Ingesting it for seven days grants immortality. Alternatively, knead this elixir with *xuangao* (\"Mystic Paste\") and place it in a fierce fire; in an instant, it becomes yellow gold. Further, combine 220 *zhu* of it with one hundred *jin* of mercury and fire it for thirty-six days to produce yellow gold. When the gold forms, the elixir is complete. If the gold does not form, reseal the elixir and fire it again for the same number of days—it will invariably succeed.\n\nThe second elixir is named *Shen Fu* (\"Divine Talisman\"). Ingesting it for one hundred days grants immortality. When crossing great waters, apply this elixir to the soles of the feet, and one may walk upon the water. Taking three *daogui* of it causes the Three Corpses and Nine Worms to dissolve and vanish, curing all ailments.\n\nThe third elixir is named *Shen Dan* (\"Divine Elixir\"). Ingesting one *daogui* grants immortality in one hundred days. Even if fed to livestock, their mouths will never again touch wood or die. It also repels the Five Weapons. After one hundred days of ingestion, immortal youths and jade maidens, along with the spirits of mountains and rivers, will attend one, appearing in human form.\n\nThe fourth elixir is named *Huan Dan* (\"Returning Elixir\"). Ingesting one *daogui* grants immortality in one hundred days. Vermilion birds and phoenixes will soar above, and jade maidens will draw near. Combining one *daogui* with one *jin* of mercury and firing it instantly produces yellow gold. Applying this elixir to money or objects ensures their return the same day they are spent. Writing with this elixir upon the eyes of an ordinary person causes all ghosts to flee.\n\nThe fifth elixir is named *Er Dan* (\"Edible Elixir\"). Ingesting it for thirty days grants immortality. Ghosts and spirits will attend, and jade maidens will appear before one.\n\nThe sixth elixir is named *Lian Dan* (\"Refined Elixir\"). Ingesting it for ten days grants immortality. It may also be combined with mercury and fired to produce yellow gold.\n\nThe seventh elixir is named *Rou Dan* (\"Supple Elixir\"). Ingesting one *daogui* grants immortality in one hundred days. Mixing it with the sweat from a washbasin and ingesting it allows even ninety-year-old men and women to bear children. When combined with lead and fired, it becomes yellow gold.\n\nThe eighth elixir is named *Fu Dan* (\"Subduing Elixir\"). Ingesting it for one hundred days grants immortality. Carrying a piece the size of a jujube pit while traveling causes all ghosts to avoid one. Writing with this elixir upon doors and windows prevents all evil spirits and malevolent beings from approaching, and it also repels thieves, tigers, and wolves.\n\nThe ninth elixir is named *Han Dan* (\"Cold Elixir\"). Ingesting one *daogui* grants immortality in one hundred days. Immortal youths and jade maidens will attend, and one may fly lightly without the need for wings.\n\nOf these Nine Elixirs, obtaining even one is sufficient for immortality; there is no need to prepare all of them. The choice depends on one’s preference.\n\nWhen ingesting the Nine Elixirs, if one wishes to ascend to heaven, one may depart; if one prefers to remain among men, that is also permissible. All may freely enter and exit the realm of the immortals without harm.\n\nThere is also the Divine Elixir of the Great Clarity Palace, whose method was transmitted by the Primordial Lord. The Primordial Lord was the teacher of the Old Lord. *The Upper Scripture of the Great Clarity* contains nine chapters: the upper three may not be taught; the middle three are unworthy of transmission in the world and should be sunk into the depths of the Three Springs. The lower three chapters are precisely the three scrolls of the *Elixir Scripture*—upper, middle, and lower.\n\nThe Primordial Lord was a great divine immortal. He could harmonize yin and yang, command ghosts and spirits, and ride upon wind and rain, with nine dragons and twelve white tigers at his service. All the immortals of the world were subject to him. Yet he himself said that he had originally studied the Dao and attained his state through ingesting the elixir—it was not innate. How could a mortal man die?\n\nThe scripture states: The superior person who attains the Dao ascends to the heavenly offices; the middling person dwells upon Kunlun; the inferior person achieves long life in the world. Foolish people do not believe this, dismissing it as empty words. From dawn to dusk, they engage only in actions that lead to death, never seeking to ascend to heaven—how could they be forcibly granted life? Ordinary people know only fine food, beautiful clothing, music, sensual pleasures, wealth, and rank. Indulging their desires to the fullest, they are but fleeting beings doomed to perish. Take care not to reveal the divine elixir to them, lest they mock the Dao and slander the truth. Transmitting the elixir scripture to the unworthy will bring misfortune upon oneself. If one encounters a person of sincere faith, one may share the compounded elixir with them, but never lightly transmit the method.\n\nWhat need has one who knows this Dao for the rank of a prince or king? Once the divine elixir is completed, it not only grants long life but can also be used to make gold. Upon producing one hundred *jin* of gold, first perform a grand offering, for which there is a separate method—it is not the same as the ritual for the Nine Cauldrons. The offering must be made by separately designating the gold for each deity: twenty *jin* to Heaven, five *jin* to the Sun and Moon, eight *jin* to the Northern Dipper, eight *jin* to the Great Unity, five *jin* to the Well, five *jin* to the Great Turtle, twelve *jin* to the River Earl, five *jin* to the Earth Altar, and five *jin* each to the spirits of doors, windows, and the household—totaling eighty *jin*. Place the remaining twenty *jin* in a reed sack, and on an auspicious day during a bustling market hour, silently abandon it in a crowded place, then depart without looking back. Only after using one hundred *jin* in this manner may one freely use the gold. If one does not first offer gold to the various spirits, one will surely incur misfortune.\n\nIt is further said: The Way of long life does not lie in sacrificial offerings or serving ghosts and spirits, nor in breathing exercises or bending and stretching. The essential method for ascending as an immortal lies in the divine elixir. Knowing it is not easy; practicing it is truly difficult. If you can prepare it, you may attain long life.\n\nIn recent times, during the late Han, Lord Yin of Xinye compounded this Great Clarity Elixir and attained immortality.",

      "translated_text": "This individual was originally a Confucian scholar, possessed of literary talent. He composed poems, eulogies for the *Canon of the Elixir*, and a preface, recounting his early Daoist studies and his teacher’s teachings from beginning to end. He listed over thirty acquaintances who had attained immortality through these methods—all clearly documented.\n\nThough this *Great Clarity Elixir* is a minor refinement, it is more difficult to compound than the *Nine-Cauldron Elixir*. Yet it remains the supreme method for ascending to heaven in broad daylight. To prepare it, one must first create *Flower Pool Urine Water*, *Golden Duke’s Yellow Bloom*, *Cinnabar Salt’s Mountain Snow*, *Mysterious White Flying Talisman*, and *Three-Five Divine Water* before kindling the fire.\n\nA single-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in three years.\nA double-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in two years.\nA triple-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in one year.\nA quadruple-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in half a year.\nA quintuple-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in one hundred days.\nA sextuple-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in thirty days.\nA septuple-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in twenty days.\nAn octuple-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in ten days.\nA nonuple-transformation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in a single day.\n\nTo refine the nonuple-transformation elixir, place it within the *Divine Crucible*. After the Summer Solstice, expose it to the sun until the crucible grows hot. Then place one *jin* of *Cinnabar Child* beneath the lid, and wait attentively. When the sun’s essence shines upon it, in an instant, all will rise together in radiant splendor—resplendent with five-colored divine light—and transform into *Returned Elixir*. Ingesting a single *knife-point* of it will grant ascent to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThe nonuple-transformation elixir is also sealed and buried in an earthen cauldron, fired with chaff—first gentle heat, then fierce. Each transformation, from the first to the ninth, varies in duration. The fewer the transformations, the fewer the days required, but the elixir’s potency remains insufficient, thus requiring more time for ingestion and delaying immortality. The greater the number of transformations, the more potent the elixir, thus requiring less time for ingestion and hastening immortality.\n\nThere is also the *Nine Radiance Elixir*, distinct from the *Nine-Transformation Elixir*, though their methods are largely similar. To prepare it, first combine the various ingredients and refine them through five stones: cinnabar, realgar, white arsenic, azurite, and magnetite. Each stone undergoes five transformations, yielding five colors; the five stones together produce twenty-five colors. One *liang* of each color is stored in separate vessels.\n\nTo revive the dead who have not yet been deceased for three days, take a *knife-point* of the green elixir, mix it with water, bathe the corpse, and place another *knife-point* into its mouth—the dead will immediately revive.\n\nTo summon a traveling kitchen, mix the black elixir with water and anoint the left hand. Whatever is spoken aloud will instantly appear, capable of manifesting all things under heaven.\n\nTo become invisible, foreknow future events, or halt aging, ingest a *knife-point* of the *Yellow Bloom Elixir*—one will attain longevity and cease aging. Sitting, one may perceive events a thousand *li* away, discerning fortune and misfortune as if before one’s eyes. The destinies of all people—prosperity or decline, longevity or early death, wealth or poverty—will be known. These methods are all recorded in the middle scroll of the *Great Clarity*.\n\nThere is also the *Five Spirits Elixir Canon* in one scroll, containing five methods. It employs cinnabar, realgar, orpiment, sulfur, azurite, arsenic, magnetite, halite, *Taiyi Yu Yu Root*, *Six-One Clay*, and a *Divine Chamber*. After sacrificial rites, it is compounded and fired for thirty-six days to completion. Additionally, *Five Emperor Talismans*, painted in five colors, can also confer immortality, though they are not as potent as the *Great Clarity* or *Nine-Cauldron Elixirs*.\n\nThere is also the *Min Mountain Elixir Method*, discovered by the Daoist Zhang He, who devoted himself to meditation in a stone chamber on Min Mountain. His method involves smelting cold brass to fashion a *Square Vessel*, which collects *Moon Water*. Mercury is then placed over it to capture the essence of the sun’s fire. Long-term ingestion confers immortality.\n\nAnother method involves placing elixir in a *Realgar Copper Crucible*, covering it with mercury, and exposing it to the sun for twenty days. After refinement, ingest a *small bean’s* worth with *Well-Flower Water*. Within a hundred days, the blind regain sight, all illnesses are cured, white hair turns black, and lost teeth regrow.\n\nThere is also the *Master Wucheng’s Elixir*, which uses *Ba Cinnabar* placed in an eight-inch copper tray. A clay furnace filled with charcoal is arranged with three trenches, and the tray is suspended above. *Stone Sulfur Water* is poured over it, keeping it mud-like. Ingesting it for a hundred days confers immortality.\n\nThere is also the *Master Xianmen’s Elixir Method*, which steeps one *jin* of cinnabar in three *dou* of wine for thirty days. Ingesting it for a single day expels the *Three Worms* and all diseases. Ingesting it for three years perfects the Daoist way, and two jade maidens will attend, ready to serve and instantly summon a traveling kitchen. This elixir can also repel malevolent ghosts, vengeful spirits, and the misfortunes of the dead afflicting homes or construction sites. Hang it facing the source of harm, and all will be well.\n\nThere is also the *Instant Elixir*, which has nine variants, resembling the *Nine-Cauldron Elixir* but inferior in potency. Its essential method involves taking realgar, burning it, and pouring it into a copper vessel, which is then inverted over three-year-old pure bitter wine. After a hundred days, the vessel will grow red nodules several *fen* long, or five-colored *langgan* jade. Refining and ingesting it also grants longevity.\n\nIt is further said that mixing the first sprouts of *Cuscuta* (whose roots resemble rabbits) and extracting their juice to blend with this elixir allows instantaneous transformation at will. Combined with *Vermilion Grass*, a single dose enables one to ride the void and travel upon clouds. *Vermilion Grass* resembles a small mulberry or jujube tree, standing three to four *chi* tall, with entirely red branches and leaves. Its stem resembles coral, and it grows beneath cliffs in famous mountains. When cut, its sap flows like blood. If jade, the *Eight Stones*, gold, or silver are cast into it, they can be kneaded like clay and, over time, dissolve into water.",
      "overlap_context": "e will surely incur misfortune.\n\nIt is further said: The Way of long life does not lie in sacrificial offerings or serving ghosts and spirits, nor in breathing exercises or bending and stretching. The essential method for ascending as an immortal lies in the divine elixir. Knowing it is not easy; practicing it is truly difficult. If you can prepare it, you may attain long life.\n\nIn recent times, during the late Han, Lord Yin of Xinye compounded this Great Clarity Elixir and attained immortality.",

      "translated_text": "When gold is cast into it, it becomes known as \"Golden Nectar.\" When jade or stone is added, it is called \"Jade Elixir.\" Ingesting it grants longevity.\n\nThere is also a method for obtaining *Fu Dan*: it is said that among the world’s waters named after cinnabar—such as Nanyang’s *Dan Shui*—there dwell cinnabar fish, perpetually red. On the tenth night after the Summer Solstice, one must wait for them; the cinnabar fish will rise to the water’s edge, their red glow illuminating upward like fire. Casting a net retrieves them, though one must not take all. Slicing their blood and applying it to the soles of the feet allows one to walk upon water and dwell long in the depths.\n\nAnother method, the *Chi Song Zi Dan*, involves taking the sap of thousand-year-old *Meng* and the juice of *Fan Tao*, mixing them with cinnabar, and placing them in a non-leaching vessel. Seal the mouth tightly with silk, bury it two *chi* underground, and after a hundred days, extract the juice from the red fruit of the *Zi* tree, blend it, and ingest it. This will turn one’s face, eyes, beard, and hair perpetually red. Was not the *Red-Bearded Master* among the *Zhong Huang* immortals one who consumed this elixir?\n\nThere is also the *White Stone Elixir* method: gather pine needles from precipitous cliffs, *Golden Chrysanthemum* flowers, *Xia Ling*, and *Xia Shen*, grind them into powder, and ingest with *Hua Chi* water to summon divine spirits. Alternatively, dry *Mulberry* leaves in the shade for a hundred days, refine them with honey into pills or powder, and long-term ingestion grants longevity and a light body.\n\nAnother method involves taking fledgling crows before their feathers grow, feeding them a mixture of true cinnabar and beef. As they mature, their feathers turn entirely red. Kill them, dry them in the shade for a hundred days, then grind them—feathers and all—into powder. Ingesting a *dao gui* measure grants five hundred years of life.\n\nThe *Kang Feng Zi Dan* method uses the blood of sheep, crows, and storks, blended with the juice of *Shao Shi Tian Xiong*, and mixed with cinnabar inside a pigeon egg. Seal it with lacquer, place it in *Yun Mu* water, and after a hundred days, it transforms into red liquid. Drinking a *ge* measure extends life by a hundred years; a *sheng* grants a thousand years.\n\nThe *Cui Wen Zi Dan* method involves placing cinnabar inside a goose egg and steaming it. Ingestion prolongs life, and long-term use confers immortality.\n\nThe *Liu Zi Dan* method requires soaking cinnabar in *Xuan Shui* liquid for a hundred days until it turns purple and can be held without staining the hands. Blend it with *Yun Mu* water, seal it in a bamboo tube with lacquer, and submerge it in a well. After a hundred days, it becomes red liquid. Drinking a *ge* measure grants a hundred years of life; long-term use ensures longevity.\n\nThe *Le Zi Chang Dan* method combines *Zeng Qing*, *Qian Dan*, mercury, and cinnabar in a copper vessel, sealed with talc and steamed in white sand for eighty days. Ingesting a dose the size of a small bean grants immortality within three years.\n\nThe *Li Wen Dan* method involves wrapping cinnabar in white silk and boiling it in bamboo sap to produce \"Red Spring.\" Steam it over boiling water, blend with *Xuan Shui*, and ingest. One *ge* measure grants a year of immortality.\n\nThe *Yin Zi Dan* method mixes cinnabar with *Yun Mu* water, seals it tightly, and places it in a *Jin Hua* pool for a year. Upon retrieval, ingesting a *dao gui* measure—consuming a full *jin*—grants five hundred years of life.\n\nThe *Tai Yi Zhao Hun Dan* method uses five minerals and seals them with *Liu Yi* clay, resembling the *Nine Elixirs*. It is especially effective for reviving those who have suddenly died; if administered within three days, pry open the teeth, place a pill inside along with sulfur, and wash it down with water. The deceased will revive, claiming to have seen messengers with tallies summoning them.\n\nThe *Cai Nü Dan* method blends rabbit blood with cinnabar and honey, steaming it for a hundred days. Ingesting a pill the size of a *Wu* seed three times daily for a hundred and one days summons a divine maiden or river spirit to serve at one’s command.\n\nThe *Ji Qiu Zi Dan* method combines clear wine, sesame oil, *Bai Hua Li*, and *Dragon Grease*, seals it with *Liu Yi* clay, and warms it with chaff fire for ten days. Ingesting a dose the size of a small bean—consuming the entire preparation—grants five hundred years of life.\n\nThe *Mo Zi Dan* method uses mercury and the essences of the five-colored stones, heated in a copper vessel with an iron spoon for ten days until it reverts to cinnabar. Ingesting a *dao gui* measure cures all ailments; long-term use confers immortality.\n\nThe *Zhang Zi He Dan* method combines lead, mercury, cinnabar, and *Zeng Qing* water, seals it, and steams it in red millet for eighty days. Mix with jujube paste to form pills, and ingest a dose the size of a soybean. After a hundred days, one attains five hundred years of life.\n\nThe *Qi Li Ji Dan* method first sublimes the five minerals into jade dust, blends it with cinnabar and mercury, and places it in a large copper tube to boil for a hundred days until it turns five-colored. Ingestion grants flight as an immortal. With a hundred *jin* of lead and a hundred *dao gui* of the elixir, smelting produces white silver. Blending with *Xiong Huang* water and firing for a hundred days yields gold. If the gold is too hard, boil it in *Chu* sap; if too soft, boil it in white plum juice. Consuming the entire preparation grants longevity.\n\nThe *Wang Gui Dan* method blends cinnabar with *Hua Chi*, covers it with powdered *Zeng Qing* and *Hang Huang*, places it in a vessel, and steams it for fifty days. Ingesting it for a hundred days summons the Jade Maidens of the Six *Jia* and Six *Ding*, who attend and serve, revealing all matters under heaven.\n\nThe *Zhou Hou Dan* method mixes *Jin Hua* with cinnabar, seals it in a vessel with dry tiles, and steams it for eighty days. The resulting dose, the size of a small bean, is placed in a dish and exposed to sunlight; its light connects with the sun. Ingesting a dose grants longevity. When cast into *Dan Yang* copper and fired, it transforms into gold.\n\nAnother method involves blending cinnabar with pomelo juice; ingesting it for a hundred days grants longevity.\n\nThe *Li Gong Dan* method uses true cinnabar and the waters of the five minerals, each a *sheng*, blended into a paste and fired in a cauldron for thirty-six days.

      "translated_text": "Ge Hong said: The *Jin Ye* (Golden Liquid), which the Supreme Unity consumed to ascend as an immortal, surpasses even the Nine Elixirs. To compound it, take one *jin* of yellow gold by the ancient scale, along with *xuanming*, dragon’s marrow bone, *Taiyi xunshou zhong* stone water, purple-trailing maiden’s dark water liquid, and cinnabar transformed by gold. Seal these to form a liquid.\n\nThe authentic scripture states: When the *Jin Ye* enters the mouth, the body turns golden. The Old Lord received this from the Primordial Lord, who declared, “This Way is most weighty—emerging but once in a hundred generations. It is concealed in a stone chamber. To compound it, one must fast and abstain, shun all contact with the profane, and erect a purified chamber beside a mountain stream flowing east. After a hundred days, it is complete. Ingesting one *liang* grants ascent as an immortal. If one does not yet wish to depart the world but seeks only to become an earthbound immortal, a hundred-day fast suffices. To ascend to heaven, one must first abstain from grains for a year before ingesting it. Taking half a *liang* ensures longevity without death, rendering one invulnerable to all harm and a hundred poisons. One may then keep a wife and children, establish a household, hold office, and pursue desires without restriction—nothing is forbidden. Should one later wish to ascend to heaven, one must fast and abstain anew, then ingest another *liang* to become a flying immortal.\n\nThe *Jin Ye* also serves as the method for *Wei Xi Ju Sheng* (Majestic Joy and Mighty Victory). Take *Jin Ye* and mercury of the left flavor, boil them together for thirty days, then store in an earthenware jar sealed with *liuyi* mud. Place it over a fierce fire and heat until it transforms into an elixir. Ingesting a dose the size of a small bean grants immortality. With one *daokui* of this elixir, powder a *jin* of mercury to turn it into silver. Taking one *jin* of this elixir and fanning it with a fierce fire transforms it into flowing red gold, called *Dan Jin* (Elixir Gold). Coating blades and swords with it repels all weapons for ten thousand *li*. Fashioning bowls and plates from this *Dan Jin* and eating from them grants longevity. Drawing forth the essences of the sun and moon yields divine liquid, like obtaining water with a *fangzhu*, and drinking it ensures immortality. Mixing *Jin Ye* with yellow earth and placing it in a *liuyi* mud jar, then heating it with a fierce fire, transforms it entirely into yellow gold, which may be used for all purposes. Heating it again transforms it back into an elixir. Ingesting a dose the size of a small bean allows one to enter famous mountains and great waters as an earthbound immortal. With one *daokui*, powder mercury to instantly form silver. Mixing one *liang* of this silver with one *jin* of lead transforms all into silver.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Golden Liquid* states: Cast eight *liang* of gold into an eastward-flowing stream, swear an oath in blood, and then recite the oral incantation. Without knowing the original method, one who steals the formula and attempts it will never succeed. Only those of utmost faith may be given the medicine. The scripture must not be lightly transmitted, or both giver and receiver will suffer calamity. Heaven’s surveillance of mortals is close, though they remain unaware.\n\nGe Hong said: The Nine Elixirs are indeed the supreme method for immortality, yet their preparation requires an abundance of miscellaneous ingredients. If the four directions are unobstructed, these may be procured in markets. But if the nine regions are divided, the materials become unattainable. Moreover, when kindling the fire, one must tend it day and night, carefully regulating its intensity to avoid error—a labor of extreme difficulty. Thus, it is not as simple as compounding the *Jin Ye*. The only challenge in preparing *Jin Ye* is obtaining the gold. One *jin* by the ancient scale weighs two *jin* today, costing no more than twenty thousand coins. The other ingredients are relatively easy to acquire, and no fire is required—one merely places them in the *Hua Chi* (Flower Pond) until the allotted days are complete. The total cost amounts to thirty thousand coins for one dose, sufficient to immortalize eight people. However, if the quantity is even slightly reduced, the potency will be insufficient for transformation, like brewing wine from a few measures of rice—it will never ferment.\n\nGe Hong said: Next is the method of ingesting yellow gold. Though not equal to the *Jin Ye*, it far surpasses other medicines. Some refine it with *maoyu* or *qimu* and *qiwu*, or wear it in a leather pouch, or dissolve it with lodestone wine, or draw it out like cloth, or instantly transform it into water for ingestion. Some methods have prohibitions not found in the *Jin Ye* process. Combining it with realgar, orpiment, and the like allows one to stretch and mold it like leather—all these are methods for earthbound immortality. Silver and large pearls from clams may also be transformed into water for ingestion, but they require prolonged consumption and are difficult to sustain, thus inferior to the *Jin Ye*.\n\nGe Hong said: The *Jin Ye* and Nine Elixirs demand wealth and seclusion in the mountains, away from worldly affairs, so few can undertake them. Among ten thousand, perhaps one may obtain the scriptures, hence those who compose Daoist texts rarely discuss the golden elixir. The foremost prohibition is that skeptics and unbelievers must not slander or defame it, or it will surely fail.\n\nMaster Zheng said: The reason is this—when compounding such great medicines, one must perform sacrifices. During the sacrifice, the Supreme Unity, Primordial Lord, Nine Elixir Old Lord, and Jade Maidens all come to oversee. If the alchemist does not retreat to a secluded place, allowing the profane or wicked to witness the process, the gods will reproach the alchemist for failing to uphold the scriptural precepts, permitting evil tongues to defame the work. They will withdraw their protection, allowing demonic forces to interfere, and the elixir will not succeed. One must enter a famous mountain, fast for a hundred days, abstain from the five pungent foods and raw fish, and avoid all contact with the profane before attempting the great medicine. The fast must continue until the elixir is complete, not merely at the outset. Master Zheng said that Lord Zuo informed him: No minor mountain is suitable for compounding the *Jin Ye* or divine elixir. Lesser mountains lack true spirits to preside over them and are often inhabited by thousand-year-old creatures or blood-consuming ghosts.",
      "overlap_context": "Dan*, mixes white honey with cinnabar in a copper vessel, seals it, and submerges it in a well. After one full cycle, ingest it to go years without hunger; consuming a whole *jin* grants a lifespan of a hundred years.\n\nAnother method, the *Han Zhong Dan*, combines lacquer and honey with cinnabar, then refines the mixture. It extends years and sharpens vision. After a thousand days of ingestion, one casts no shadow at noon. Beyond these, there remain dozens of other methods, not worth discussing.",

      "translated_text": "These beings are all imbued with malevolent *qi*, causing alchemical compounds to fail. They bring no fortune to men, only misfortune, and delight in testing Daoists. Though Daoists may employ protective measures to shield themselves and their disciples, such entities may still spoil the elixir. Even today, physicians compounding fine medicines or salves avoid the gaze of chickens, dogs, women, or children. Should such beings violate the process, the remedies lose their efficacy. Moreover, dyers despise those who observe their work, and those with the evil eye may cause colors to fade—how much more so for the divine elixir and great medicine? Thus, the ancients and Daoists seeking to compound the grand elixirs of immortality invariably entered renowned mountains, never mere ordinary peaks, precisely for this reason.\n\nFurthermore, according to the *Immortals’ Scriptures*, the mountains where one may concentrate the mind to compound elixirs of transcendence include: Mount Hua, Mount Tai, Mount Huo, Mount Heng, Mount Songgao, Mount Shaoshi, Mount Wu, Mount Zhongnan, Mount Wangwu, Mount Nüji, Mount Difei, Mount Baodu, Mount Anqiu, Mount Qian, Mount Qingcheng, Mount Sui, Mount Yuntai, Mount Luofu, Mount Yangjia, Mount Huangjin, Mount Ao Zu, Mount Tiantai, Mount Siwang, and Mount Gaizhu. These mountains all harbor true spirits, and some are home to earthbound immortals. Above, they bear *zhi* mushrooms, and within, one may evade great wars and floods. Yet their purpose extends beyond elixir-compounding: should a man of the Dao ascend them, the mountain spirits will surely aid him in attaining fortune, and his medicine will succeed. For those unable to reach these mountains, the great islands of the sea may also serve for compounding elixirs. Among them, the secondary choices include Dongweng Isle in Kuaiji, Fen Isle, Yangju Isle in Xu Province, Shu Isle, and Guang Isle, as well as Yu Isle.\n\nIn the present age, the renowned mountains of the Central Kingdom are inaccessible, but in Jiangdong, the following may be visited: Mount Huo in Jin’an and Changsha; Mount Tai and Mount Taibai in Dongyang; Mount Siwang, Mount Tiantai, Mount Gaizhu, and Mount Kuocang, all in Kuaiji.\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity says: Though I am the descendant of great ministers, my talents are insufficient to govern the realm or manage affairs. Yet among my peers, many have soared to the clouds and shone in the celestial vault, surpassing my humble attainments. Thus, I have severed ties of mourning and celebration with my hometown, forsaken the glory of the present age, and resolved to swiftly ascend the famous mountains to complete the works I have authored. Next, I shall compound the divine elixir to pursue longevity. For this, the worldly deem me mad—abandoning my homeland, turning from the clear path, and toiling in the forests and marshes, my hands and feet calloused. They say I suffer from delusion. Yet the Dao runs counter to the world, and affairs cannot be pursued in tandem. If I did not set aside worldly duties, how could I cultivate such aspirations? When one’s vision is clear and resolve unwavering, what fear is there of slander or praise? How could discouragement or persuasion sway me? I record these thoughts to share with those of like mind in the future.\n\nI imagine that those who later form bonds of unbreakable fellowship will share my convictions. The formula for the Minor Divine Elixir: Take three *jin* of true cinnabar and six *jin* of white honey, mix them, expose to sunlight daily, and simmer until pliable enough to form pills. Consume one pill the size of a sesame seed daily, ten pills in total. Within a year, white hair will turn black, lost teeth will regrow, and the body will become lustrous. With prolonged use, the elderly will regain their youth, and one may attain immortality.\n\nThe method for the Minor Elixir of Cinnabar: Grind one *jin* of cinnabar into fine powder, then combine with three *sheng* of pure bitter wine and three *sheng* of pure lacquer. Simmer the three ingredients over a low flame until they can be formed into pills. Consume three pills the size of sesame seeds, twice daily. After thirty days, the hundred diseases of the abdomen will be cured, and the Three Corpses expelled. After a hundred days, the muscles and bones will grow strong and firm. After a thousand days, the Controller of Destinies will erase one’s name from the register of death, and one will be safeguarded by Heaven and Earth, gazing upon the sun and moon. One’s form and countenance will transform, assuming myriad shapes, and at midday, one will cast no shadow, for one will possess a radiance of one’s own.\n\nThe method for the Minor Elixir of Gold: Dissolve gold in clear wine, repeating the process approximately two hundred times, until the mixture froths upon insertion and removal. Knead it until it oozes between the fingers like mud. If it does not froth or fails to seep between the fingers, continue dissolving it in clear wine without limit. Once complete, consume a pill the size of a bullet. Alternatively, divide one pill into smaller portions. After thirty days of consumption, one will be free from cold and heat, and divine beings and jade maidens will attend to you. Silver may also be consumed in the same manner as gold. Those who dwell in the stone chambers of famous mountains and consume these two substances will ascend lightly within a year. Even if one remains among men, one will become an earthbound immortal. Do not transmit this recklessly.\n\nThe Twofold Principle Master’s method for consuming gold: Take three *jin* of *dufu* leather fat and one *sheng* of pure bitter wine. Place five *liang* of gold in a vessel and simmer over a clay stove. Insert and remove the gold into the fat a hundred times; do the same with the bitter wine. Consuming one *jin* of gold grants a lifespan coextensive with Heaven and Earth; half a *jin* grants three thousand years; five *liang* grants twelve hundred years. Regardless of quantity, gold may be consumed. Prepare and consume it on a day when the celestial stems and branches are in harmony, and the efficacy will be divine. Do not transmit this to the unworthy. Should it be shared with the unfit, the medicine will fail to achieve its potency. To cease consumption, take cinnabar.\n\nHere ends the second scroll of the *Master of Embracing Simplicity’s Scripture of Divine Immortals’ Alchemical Gold*.",
