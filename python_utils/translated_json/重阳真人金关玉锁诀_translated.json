  "full_translation": "The **Zhuangyang Zhenren’s Precious Dao of the Golden Pass and Jade Bolt**\n\nSomeone asked, *\"How is the Dao of cultivating the True One’s essence?\"*\n\nThe reply was: *\"First, eliminate the nameless afflictions. Second, refrain from clinging to wine, lust, wealth, and qi. This is the very method of cultivation.\"*\n\nNow, a human body contains the principles of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth nourish all things, and all things flourish within Heaven and Earth. Though Heaven and Earth are vast and luminous, they are never obscured by the myriad things. Those who cultivate the Dao should likewise embody all things in their responses. But someone might object: *\"Heaven has darkness and obscurity; Earth has tremors and shifts. Mountains may crumble; seas may dry up. The sun and moon wax and wane. Even humans fall prey to unpredictable sickness—how can one govern these?\"*\n\nThe reply was: *\"To govern them, one must practice the **Supreme Dao’s** method of refining the Five Phases.\"*\n\nSomeone asked, *\"What is the method of refining the Five Phases?\"*\n\nThe **Precious Dao** states: *\"First, one must uphold the **Precepts**, maintain purity and stillness, and endure suffering.\"*\n\n「Compassion and mercy are the true benevolence. Cutting off the Ten Evils, practicing skillful means, and rescuing and guiding all beings. Loyalty to the sovereign and filial piety toward parents and teachers—these are the methods of cultivation. Then, one practices the **True Function**.\n\nThe **Precious Dao** states:\n*\"First, within the body’s East and West, one must recognize **Gēng-Jiǎ-Wèi-Yǒu** (the Heavenly Stems of Metal and Wood). Second, within the body’s South and North, one must recognize **Kǎn-Lí-Qiān-Yòng** (the Water-Fire and lead-mercury correspondences).*\n\nThe **Precious Dao** further states:\n*\"**Gēng-Jiǎ-Wèi-Yǒu** (Metal-Wood Heavenly Stems) pertain to **day and night**. **Jiǎ-Wèi** (Wood-Fire) are the **qi of the liver**. Within the Eight Nodes, at **Establishing Spring** and **Spring Equinox**, the mouth produces **saliva (jīn)**. **Gēng-Yǒu** (Metal-Fire) are the **qi of the lungs**. Within the Eight Nodes, at **Establishing Autumn** and **Autumn Equinox**, the mouth produces **fluid (yè)**.*\n\n***Kǎn-Lí** (Water-Fire) pertain to **cold and heat**. **Lí-Qiān** (Fire-Metal) are the **central qi of the body**. Within the Eight Nodes, at **Establishing Summer** and **Summer Solstice**, the body produces **blood**. **Kǎn-Yòng** (Water-Metal) are the **qi of the kidneys**. Within the Eight Nodes, at **Establishing Winter** and **Winter Solstice**, the body produces **essence (jīng)**. Essence generates the **ethereal soul (pò)**; blood generates the **corporeal soul (hún)**. Essence is **innate vitality (xìng)**; blood is **life (mìng)**. Those who comprehend **innate vitality and life** have attained the **True Function** of cultivation.*\n\nThe **Precious Dao** states:\n*\"Essence and blood are the **foundations of the physical body**; **True Qi** is the **foundation of vitality and life**. Thus, it is said: **Where there is blood, there is the ability to generate True Qi**; where True Qi is robust and substantial, **longevity follows naturally**. Essence and blood coalesce to form the body.*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Yet, you are a human.\"*\n\nWhy do some die before others?\nThe answer is: Those who die first are those whose hearts cling to desire and pleasure, who covet the world. For men, this depletes their **essence**; for women, it depletes their **blood**. By day, they never cease their nameless vexations; by night, they fail to subdue the **Three Corpses** and **yin ghosts**. Thus, men and women alike already bear the mark of impermanence.\n\nSomeone asked: How then do some not die?\nThe answer is: Those who do not die are those whose bodies are pure and still, who cherish **True Qi** in the **elixir field**. Their **essence** and **blood** do not decay—such a person does not die.\n\nA challenge was raised: Many today practice purity and abstinence, yet still fail to attain the **Dao**. Why is this?\nThe answer is: Though these people may be outwardly pure, they do not grasp the **True Purity and Stillness**. Though their bodies may be still, they cannot stabilize their **essence** and **blood** or nourish **True Qi**. Their bodies may be pure, but their minds are not; their forms may be still, but their intentions are not.\n\nHave they not heard the *Scripture on Purity and Stillness* say:\n*\"The **Dao** has purity and impurity, motion and stillness. Purity is the source of impurity; motion is the foundation of stillness.\"*\n\nThe **Scripture** further states:\n*\"Without defilement, there is no purity. If one speaks of **True Purity and Stillness**, then within the eyes, there are no tears; within the nose, no pus; within the mouth, no saliva. One does not refine the large and small excretions. Men cultivate **essence**; women stabilize **blood**. All malevolence returns to harmony; all diseases do not arise.\"*\n\nNow, the **Dantian** attains true purity and stillness.\nYet today’s talk of \"purity and stillness\" is but a hollow name.\n\nIn cultivation, when inner and outer align,\nThe **Great Vehicle** first speaks of the **Lesser Vehicle**.\nThe *Heart Sutra* says:\n*\"Capable of small, capable of great—\nIt does not first speak of the past,\nBut first speaks of the present.\nThe past is fruit; the present is function.\nIt further says:\n'Function fulfilled, fruit complete—\nBefore speaking of the True,\nIt speaks of the False.'\nOnly the One Soul is True;\nThe four great elements of the fleshly body are False.\nThrough mutual borrowing, False refines into True,\nAnd unity is achieved through sensation and harmony.\nThe secret says:\n'Now, a body at ease is the **Lesser Vehicle**—\nYet it is the root of the **Great Vehicle**.\nThe initial ground of **dharma**-heart is the **Lesser Vehicle**,\nWhile its fruition is the **Great Vehicle**.\nThe **Lesser Vehicle** is the root;\nThe **Great Vehicle** is the branch.'\nThe secret says:\n'Branch and root borrow from each other—\nThe branch borrows the root to arise.'\n\nYet those who cultivate today\nDo not know whence the body comes,\nNor how **nature** and **life** are born.\nThe secret says:\n'All arise not apart from yin and yang.\nThey must borrow from **father’s essence** and **mother’s blood**—\nThese two are the body’s foundation.\nYet those who cultivate today\nDo not spare **father’s essence** or **mother’s blood**,\nDissipating **True Qi** and damaging **Original Yang**.\nThus comes aging,\nAnd from aging, disease,\nAnd from disease, death.\nSince impermanence exists,\nWhy not cure it?\n\nThe True **Dao** is:\nEmpty yet real, real yet empty.\nThe *Scripture* says:\n'**The Great Dao** has no form,\nYet gives birth to heaven and earth.\n**The Great Dao** has no name,\nYet nourishes all things.'\nSo too is the one born from True **nature**—\nThus it is.\n\nIn days past, **Laozi** refined the five phases—\nMetal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—\nLeaving behind three **Vehicles** of wondrous speech:\nEach line erases sin,\nEach phrase brings longevity.\n\nFirst: **Divine Immortals** embrace **Oneness**.\nSecond: **Wealth for the nation, peace for the people**.\nThird: **Strong armies, victory in battle**.\n\n**Question:** What is *\"Divine Immortals embrace Oneness\"*?\n**Answer:** Oneness is the root of all under heaven,\nThe root of all things—\nOneness is the **Dao**.\nIn the beginning, it was **True Water**.\nWater gave birth to **qi**,\nAnd **qi** gave birth to water.\nAll things arise from Oneness,\nAll things are nourished by Oneness.\nOneness generates Two,\nTwo generates Three,\nThree generates all things.\nWithin Three, the Four **Wisdoms** function,\nThe Five **Eyes** manifest.\nThe Six **Senses** arise,\nThe Seven **Ghosts** are swept away,\nThe Eight **Trigrams** unfold,\nThe Nine **Reflections** speak of True **Dao**.\nRelying on the **fruit of non-delusion**, all is harmonized—\nMind and thought become divine,\nDwelling eternally in the **Dantian**.\nEmbrace and guard the **Original Qi**,\nLest it scatter and be lost.\nThis is the method of **embracing Oneness**.\n\n**Question:** What is *\"Wealth for the nation, peace for the people\"*?\n**Answer:** Within the bodies of men and women,\nEach holds nine rivers and four seas.\nIn the **Dragon Palace’s treasury** lie\nSeven treasures and eight jewels—\nDo not let the Six **Bandits** steal them.\nThis is wealth for the nation, peace for the people.\n\n**Question:**\n\nWhat is *\"strong armies and victory in battle\"*?\n**Answer:** He who achieves victory in battle\nIs known by few in the world.\nVictory in battle\nIs the eternal method.\n**Objection:** You have spoken of the Way of Purity and Stillness—\nHow can you speak of victory in battle?\n**Explanation:** Today’s people do not comprehend the method of victory in battle,\nYet they can still treat the diseases of decay and impermanence.\nVictory in battle consists of three stages:\nFirst, battle and retreat the nameless afflictions.\nSecond, within the night’s realm,\nBattle and retreat the Three Corpses and ghostly demons.\nThird, battle and retreat all phenomena.\nThis is the method of victory in battle.\nIf one attains the Three Vehicles,\nThey transform calamity into blessing.\n\nThe practitioner must always take Purity and Stillness as the foundation.\nFor those who seek the Great Vehicle,\nThey must first seek the Small Vehicle.\nPurity does not depart from impurity,\nAction does not depart from stillness.\nWithin stillness, movement arises;\nWithin impurity, purity emerges.\nThere are Heaven and Earth,\nThere are Sun and Moon,\nThere are Water and Fire,\nThere are Yin and Yang—\nThis is called the True Dao.\nThe scriptures say:\n*\"Pure Yang does not generate,\nPure Yin does not grow.\nWhen Yin and Yang harmonize,\nThey can generate all things.*\nYet today’s cultivators\nDo not cultivate the True Dao.\nThe Dao is the comprehension of nature and life.\nNature and life are essence and blood.\nAll the myriad diseases of man\nAre injuries to one’s life.\nThose who suffer illness\nDo not harm the Five Viscera directly—\nThey all deplete the Three Treasures of essence, qi, and blood.\nTo seek peace and longevity,\nOne must uphold the awareness of Purity and Stillness.\nFor those not yet out of the household life,\nIf they cannot yet uphold the fruit of Purity and Stillness,\nThey may enter the Small Vehicle, then the Middle Vehicle, then the Great Vehicle.\nThe first stage is the City of Transformation,\nThe second is the Silver City,\nThe third is the Golden City.\nLike a great tree—\nFirst, there is its root,\nThen, its branches.\n\nAs for ordinary times, one should only follow Purity and Stillness—\nThis is the Great Dao/Way indeed.\n\nThe questioner asks:\n*\"Suppose one’s body is in a state of Purity and Stillness,\nYet encounters a day when the Heavenly Demons* **assail**—\nHow should one treat it?\nAnd if one encounters an External Dao/Way practitioner* **who wanders**,\nHow should one treat them?\"*\n\nThe answer is:\n*\"The wandering one is a boundary.\nBoundaries exist everywhere.\nOne must only discern how to advance or retreat.\nThree principles must be clearly distinguished—pure and impure.\nIf one encounters a practitioner of Yin-Yang Dao/Way*,\nOne must apply the method of **adding fire to water**,\n**Repelling impurity without scorching**—\n\nThe secret is:\n*\"When the Demon army arrives,\nOne must urgently prepare to **inspect the Three Thousand* **Qi-Refining* **Warriors**.\nThe secret is:\nThe **Three Thousand* **Qi-Refining* **Warriors** are the **qi** of one’s body.\nIf **qi** comes but does not depart—counting to a thousand breaths—\nOne must gather it in the **Dan Tian** without letting it disperse.\nOnly **warmth** is allowed,\n**Coldness** must be avoided.\nThis is the **self-formed embryo of the Immortal**—\nThe **wondrous method** indeed.\nIf a person attains such wondrous refinement,\nThey will forever possess this **true qi-function**.\nWhen the function is complete and the fruit fulfilled,\nThey will forever achieve peace and longevity.\nAll cultivators,\nWhen facing calamity,\nMust carefully prepare.\n\nThe questioner asks:\n*\"How should one treat it?\"*\n\nThe explanation is:\n*\"When a person faces calamity,\nThey first perceive the **signs of death**.\nThe questioner asks:\n*\"What are the signs of death?\"*\n\nThe secret is:\n*\"The **Heavenly Pillar** trembles,\nThe **Tree of Life** falls, mountains crumble.\nThe **Six Spirits** are disordered,\nLife and vitality cannot be preserved.\nThe **spirit and mind** grow dim,\nHeaven and Earth darken,\nSun and Moon lose their radiance—\nThis is the **sprout of Impermanence**.\nA **leaky body** is **Hell**,\nA **non-leaky fruit** is **Heaven**.\nFor a person with a **leaky body**,\nIf they attain the **perfected non-leaky fruit**,\nAll will together fulfill the **Dao-fruit**.\n\nThe questioner asks:\n*\"Suppose the White Ox departs...\"*\n\nHow should one capture it?\n\nThe secret is:\nWhen the White Ox departs, tightly grasp the **Mysterious Pass**,\nFirmly secure the **Four Gates**.\nSwiftly employ the **ancestor’s fishing method**,\nAnd also use the **Three-Island Seal**.\nPoint to the Yellow River flowing backward,\nCover the **Golden Pass**,\nMerge into the **Jade Lock**.\nLike cutting an eye—\nThe White Ox will naturally not flee.\nThis is called the **method of emerging from the water and reaching the opposite shore**.\n\nThere are **ten methods** to stabilize life and vitality.\nThe secret is:\n1. The **Golden Pass Jade Lock Stabilization**\n2. The **Three-Island Revival and Exchange of Life and Death Stabilization**\n3. The **Nine-Bends Yellow River Backward Flow Stabilization**\nThese are the methods for attaining the **perfected non-leaky fruit**,\nAll together fulfilling the **Dao of Immortality**.\n\nIf one achieves the stabilization of the **Precious Moment**,\nDo not let it stagnate the **waist and limbs**,\nOr dim the **eyes and vision**—\nThis is the method of stabilizing the **Three Treasures**.\n\nThe questioner asks:\n*\"If someone captures the Three Treasures,\nWhere should they transfer and store them?\nFirst, use the **Reed and Cattail Piercing-the-Knee method**,\nBoil the **qi** to surge into the **Precious Furnace**,\nCarry the **qi** straight to the **Well’s Spring**,\nSupplementing the **two feet**.\nThen perform the **Seven Circulations of the Elixir method**,\nIf the **qi** stagnates and weakens the **waist and limbs**,\nThen practice the **Iron Chariot Black Ox function**.\nThen open the **Slaughter Gate**.\nIf one attains **original essence** strong and robust,\nFirst practice the **Posterior Elbow Flying Golden Crystal method**.\nIf one does not practice this function,\nThen do not practice the **Piercing-the-Knee method**,\nNor the **Seven Circulations of the Three-Island method**,\nThen practice the **Posterior Elbow Transferring Essence to Supplement the Brain method**.\nAspiring to **eternal life and youth**—\nNowadays, people practice **functions**,\nAttending to the **upper** but neglecting the **lower**.\nLike a child building a tower,\nThe foundation is not firm.\nWhat is the way?\nThe **central essence** must be solid and strong.\n\nAgain, in the **Kan Palace**,\nUse the **Sheep, Deer, and Great Ox Three Vehicles**,\nTransfer from **Jing Mountain** to store the **Precious Essence**.\nThe secret is:\nJing Mountain is nearby,\nThere was a man surnamed **Bian** named **He**.\nOne day,\nHe went to **Jing Mountain** to gather firewood.\n\nThen he saw a phoenix perched upon a stone.\nBian He knew there was treasure within the stone.\nHe brought it to the emperor.\nThe emperor flew into a great rage,\nAnd had Bian He’s feet amputated.\n\nThe secret says:\nBian He—this is *recognition*.\nThe stone—this is the stubborn *qi*.\nThe phoenix—this is the true *qi* forming its body.\nThe jade—this is the marrow’s essence.\n\nAmputation—this is the inability to practice the Piercing-the-Knee method.\n\nThe secret says:\nThose who excel in stillness\nAre called *Lower Yuan Treasure* complete.\nLike the sun and moon in harmony,\nThen use the Three Vehicles to transport to the Kunlun Peak above.\n\nHe sighed:\nNowadays, people can speak of the Dao but cannot embody it.\nThey can explain but cannot reveal the secrets.\n\nAgain, he said:\nWhen practicing functions,\nThe mind moves, but the intention does not.\nNowadays, many are deluded.\nThey do not cultivate their bodies.\n\nFirst:\nThe divine nature is the Great Ox Vehicle.\nOne must seek the movement of the Green Ox to pull the vehicle.\nThe treasure within the vehicle is the Deer Vehicle.\n\nSecond:\nPractice the White Ox to pull the vehicle.\nThe treasure within the vehicle is the same.\n\nThird:\nWhen warm *qi* moves greatly, this is the Sheep Vehicle.\nThe Red Ox pulls the vehicle.\nThe treasure within the vehicle is the same.\n\nThe Three Vehicles in motion first depart from the tail of Jing Mountain and the *Yúlǘ* pass.\nThey enter the Earth’s axis,\npass the Celestial Gate,\npass the Lower Double Gate.\nThe *Shènyú* acupoints mark the waist,\nthe legs descend into Caoqi Creek’s earth.\nThe *Jiājí* halts at the Double Gate—\n*Jiājí* itself.\nThe double arrows ascend to Shangyuan’s rocky ridge, the Dividing Waters Peak—\nalso called the Heavenly Terrace Ridge,\nor the Women’s Treasure-Carrying Ridge.\nPlace *ruxiang* resin at the front,\nfrequently advance the True Fire.\nIf this practice is followed,\na woman’s body in one year becomes like a boy’s.\n\nImagine the lead-mercury dual elixir—\nshoot toward Penglai’s brain, where it opens.\nThe Celestial Gate itself opens, revealing crimson clouds.\nTrue *qi* enters the marrow sea, warming it,\nmaking one’s hair turn white, then black again.\nThis is called the *Elbow-Post Flying Golden Crystal* method.\n\nMy teacher said:\nAll see the well-digger,\nbut none see the rope’s use.\nThough later-born ones possess divine water,\nthey still lack the Return-to-the-Dantian method.\n\nWhen practicing, the *Zi-Wu* hours arise—\nsit cross-legged, knead the hands,\nas if True *qi* seethes through the body.\nPass the Celestial Bridge,\npass the forehead’s cranium—\nonly guide the upper and lower cheeks.\nUse the mind to divide above,\nletting True *qi* flow downward in two streams.\nThe primal *yang* essence\ndescends to the cheeks,\nthen flows upward through the teeth,\nfrom the left mouth corner to the right,\nextracting the fluid.\n\nAgain, the **Black Pearl’s Ambrosia** is refined—\nthe **Red Dragon** stirs it evenly.\nWhen rinsed, it becomes **Snowflower White**,\nwith a sweet taste.\n\nThe mouth is an **Eight-Colored Glass Canal**,\nwhere **Eight-Flavored Waters** dwell within.\nFrom these waters arise the **Eight Consciousnesses**.\nWhen the mouth holds **True Qi**,\nthat **Qi** divides into the **Eight Trigrams**:\n\n**Gèn** marks the **Spring Equinox**,\n**Zhèn** the **Spring Solstice**,\n**Xùn** the **Summer Equinox**,\n**Lǐ** the **Summer Solstice**,\n**Kūn** the **Autumn Equinox**,\n**Duì** the **Autumn Solstice**,\n**Qián** the **Winter Equinox**,\n**Kǎn** the **Winter Solstice**.\n\nWithin the **Eight Trigrams**, yin and yang arise;\nwithin yin and yang, cold and heat divide.\n\n**The Secret says:**\nSwallowing saliva is **yin**—\nthen guiding the breath afterward makes it **yang**.\nOne must seek the **Water-Fire Balance**,\ndividing the **Clear Saliva** into three parts—\nswallow two parts, keep one in reserve,\nlest the **Tree wither and dry**.\n\nIt is also said:\n*\"Cherish the flowing water—*\n*do not let rivers run dry.\"*\n\n**On the Seven Returns:**\n**The Secret says:**\nSwallowing **Divine Water**,\nwhen it reaches the **Lung’s Preface**,\nit transforms into fluid,\nhealing all coughs.\nGradually, it nourishes the **Po**.\n\nIt is also said:\nSwallowing saliva to the **Heart** opens wisdom,\ncleansing the mind—**Divine Water for the Heart**.\nThe **Ode of Washing the Heart to See Nature** says:\n*\"Seeing the five-petaled flower bloom,*\n*step by step ascending to the Immortal Platform.\"*\n\n**Divine Water** transforms into blood.\nSwallowing it to the **Liver**—\nthe **Liver is Wood**, falsely named **Green Dragon**.\nWhen the Dragon drinks water, it thrives,\nhealing all eye ailments.\nThe **Qi** condenses into saliva.\n\nSwallowing to the **Spleen**—\nthe **Spleen is Earth**; Earth with water\ngrows **Yellow Sprouts**.\nThe belly holds the **Large and Small Intestines**,\nnine curves leading to the **Navel’s One Inch Three Divisions**—\na round field, one inch wide:\n**Left is Blue, Right is White,**\n**Front is Red, Back is Black,**\n**Center is Yellow**—**Wu-Ji**—\nnamed the **Dan Field**.\n\nWithin the Field stands a **Palace**,\nnamed the **Yellow Court**.\nThe Palace holds a **Fermenting Vat**,\nnamed the **Dan Vat**.\nUpon it sits a **Golden Cauldron**,\nsteadily fed with **True Fire** below,\nconstantly replenished with **Divine Water** above.\n**Water and Fire** are **Kǎn and Lǐ**—\n**Sovereign Fire, Minister Fire, Common Fire**—\nthe **Three Fires** are the **True Flavors**:\n**Heart, Nature, Mind**.\n\nYet men do not grasp these Three—\nthe **First Flavor** is unclear,\nthe **Second** unenlightened,\nthe **Third** fails to reach **Dao**.\n\nIf one attains the Three,\nthey gain **Three Clarities and Six Powers**.\n\nWhen refining, **wash above with water**,\n**fuse below with fire**.\nThe **Classic** says:\n*\"Fire issues from below the body,*\n*water from above.*\nWhen the upper and lower unite,\n**Heaven and Earth merge**—\nteach the **Dragon to coil in the Golden Cauldron**,\nlet the **Tiger circle the Dan Field**—\nthis is the **Vat’s Blade-Pill**.\n\nWhoever practices this\nwill forever know **Peace and Longevity**.\"\n\n**Question:** *\"When speaking of the Blade-Pill,*\n*what is the **One-Grain Blade-Pill**?\nWhat is the **Self-Ingested Blade-Pill**?\nWhat is the **Iron-Separated Blade-Pill**?\"*\n\n**The Secret says:**\nThe **Three Blade-Pills** are **Treasure**—\n**Essence, Qi, Blood**.\n\n**The One-Grain Blade-Pill** is **saliva**.\n**The Self-Ingested Blade-Pill** is swallowing saliva to nourish **Qi**.\n**The Iron-Separated Blade-Pill** is **True Qi**,\npracticed without retreat,\nturning all evils to purity.\n\nWhen practicing, one eats **Golden Rice** when hungry,\ndrinks **Jade Nectar** when thirsty,\nadds **Fire** in cold,\nadds **Water** in heat.\n**Fire is True Yang, Water is True Yin**—\nthis is the **Method of Extraction, Addition, and Balance**.\n\n**The Secret says:**\n**Extraction** is drawing **True Qi** from above,\n**Addition** is warming **Qi** from below into the **Dan Field**.\nIf the **Kidney Palace** is warmed,\nall diseases vanish.\n\n**Question:** *\"Why do men and women suddenly fall ill without warning?\nHow should one respond?\"*\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**For all men and women,**\ntheir hearts are attached to desire and pleasure,\ngreedily clinging to the disputes of sensory realms.\nBy day, they do not sever nameless afflictions;\nat night, in stillness, they cannot dispel the **Three Corpses** and **Yin Ghosts**.\nMen deplete their **essence (精)**,\nwomen deplete their **blood and qi (血氣)**.\nThe **Three Treasures (三寶)** flee, and **Original Yang (元陽)** is lost—\nthus, people fall ill without warning.\n\nIf one does not heed the words of the **Immortal Daoists (神仙)**,\nit is like a broken, leaky house:\nthe owner neglects repairs,\nand the palace collapses,\nruining its beams and pillars—\nthis is why people fall ill without warning.\n\n**The Secret says:**\n*\"Why do even young children, though pure and quiet,\nnot deplete the Three Treasures,\nyet still fall ill without warning?\"*\nIt is because their mothers’ **blood and qi (血氣)** were deficient.\nThey received their mothers’ **ten-month fetal qi (胎氣)** that was insufficient,\nor their mothers violated the **Four Seasons’ prohibitions (四集不忌)**—\noffenses against **wind, lust, heat, and dampness (風淫暑濕)**—\nwhile pregnant with the child,\nand thus the child suffers illness without warning.\n\n**Question:** *\"Why are there those with ugly and beautiful appearances?\nWhat does this mean?\"*\n\n**Answer:**\nThose with **comely features (貌正)** are born when their parents’ **two qi (二氣)**—\n**Yin and Yang (父母二氣)**—\nrespond to the **sun and moon (日月)**.\nBefore **11 AM (午時)** or after **1 AM (丑時)**,\nthey gain **proper form (端正)**,\n**true and lasting life (真實長命)**,\nwealth and fortune (**衣禄**),\nand win their parents’ **joyful hearts (喜悦之心)**.\nIf conceived between **1 AM and 11 AM**,\nthe child may bear **uncomely features (貌不正)**,\nsuffering **deafness, dumbness, or muteness (病聾喑哑)**,\na **weak constitution (多性劣)**,\nunfavorable regard from others (**不得人意**),\nshortened lifespan (**命穷**),\nand lack of wealth and fortune (**無衣禄**).\nThis is the **fundamental principle of creation (造化之根本)**.\n\n**Question:** *\"If one encounters a **karmic demon (冤魔)**,\nhow should one treat it?\"*\n\n**Answer:**\n\nWhen one encounters adversity, one must **cultivate stillness and quietude (清静)**.\nAmidst busyness, steal moments of leisure (忙中偷闲);\nWithin leisure, seek inner tranquility (闲中取静).\n\nWhen faced with calamity (有难之时),\none must swiftly withdraw and avoid (急须回避).\nThe **Mind-King (心王)** must employ the **meditative visualization (灌想)** method—\nurgently driving the **spirit-intent (神意)** into the **upper nailed seat (上泥丸)**.\nSitting upright in the **Divine Palace (神宫)**,\nvisualize before you **celestial males and females (仙男仙女)**,\neach playing **celestial music (仙乐)**.\n**Tap the teeth (叩齿)** and steady the intent (定意),\ngazing upon the **scenery of Kunlun Mountain (昆仑山景)** as it ascends—\n**oxen, sheep, deer, horses, and jade rabbits (牛羊鹿马玉兔)**.\nDirect the intent upward (意想上),\nseizing and securing the **foundation of cultivation (系定功时)**.\nSuddenly, conceive of a **treasure tree (宝树)** above,\nits branches bearing **flowers (花)** that bloom into **fruit (结子)**.\nVisualize plucking and consuming it (意摘取吞之).\nThose who ingest this substance (此物)\nshall attain **eternal bliss and longevity (永得安乐长生)**.\nThis is the **method of rectification (修正法)**—\na single phrase, fully comprehended (一句了然).\n**The Great Lock secures the Four Gates (大牢镇四门)**.\n\n**The Secret Formula (诀曰):**\nWhen the **blood sea (血海)** and **life-gate (命门)** are stilled,\nand **qi is settled (气定)**—\nno opening or closing of doors (无开闭户),\n**essence is stabilized (精定)**—\nno distraction by external realms (不思外境),\n**spirit is steadied (神定)**.\nWhen **essence and blood disperse (精血散者)**,\nthey are the **vitality and lifespan (性命也)**.\nA **single-minded intent (一意者)**—\nthis is the **true master (为真主人也)**.\nThe **teeth are the Mystic Pass (齿是为玄关)**;\nclosing the **elixir field (丹田者)**—\nthis is the **lower Mystic Pass (为下玄关)**.\nRaising the **golden essence (金精)** to the **upper Mystic Pass (上玄者)**—\nthis is the **Golden Gate (为金关)**.\n**Firmly tapping the teeth (紧叩齿者)**—\nthis is the **Jade Lock (为玉锁)**.\nWhen the **six senses remain unmoved (六根不动者)**,\nthey are the **Six Perfections (六度)**,\nknown as the **Universal Gate (都关)**.\n**Inhale and descend the breath (下纳气)**.\n\n「This is the **Tightening of the Yang Lock (勒阳关)**.\nThe upper cheek is the **Yang Lock’s apex (上腮为顶阳关)**.\nThe nose is the **Celestial Gate (天门)**.\nThe flanks are the **Double Locks (双关)**.\nWhen practicing the **alchemical work (行功)**,\nall locks open simultaneously.\nWhen the **spirit remains unmoved (神不动)**,\nthe **intent is not disturbed (意不乱)**.\nThe **intent (意)**—\nthis is the **delirious state (恍惚)**.\nThis is the **Method of Clarity and Stillness (清静之法)**.\n\nIn spring, summer, autumn, and winter,\nif the **urine of a child remains yellow (小儿小便黄色者)**,\nthe **elixir field is depleted (丹田虚败)**,\nand the **lower dantian’s true qi is lost (失却下元存真炁)**.\nUrgent use of the **Ninefold Curving Method (穿九曲法)**—\nalso called **Nine Turns Piercing the Small Intestine (九转穿小肠)**.\nNinefold penetration of **true qi into the kidney chamber (九透真炁入肾堂)**,\nand the **urine naturally becomes clear and white (小便自然清白色)**.\nThe whole body then attains **serene ease (安乐)**.\n\n**Question:** What is the **Three Vehicles’ Method (三乘之法)**?\n**Answer:** The **lower vehicle (下乘)** is like a **newborn infant (新生孩儿)**.\nThe **middle vehicle (中乘)** is like a **child sitting on the ground (小儿坐地)**.\nThe **upper vehicle (上乘)** is like a **child walking (小儿行走)**.\nIf one masters these **three vehicles (通此三乘)**,\none transcends the **Three Realms (三界)**—\nthe **Realm of Desire (欲界)**, the **Realm of Form (色界)**, and the **Formless Realm (无色界)**.\nThis is the **heart’s nature and intent (心性意)**,\nmanifesting the **Three Bodies (三身)**—\nthe **Body of Dharma (法身)**, the **Body of Reward (报身)**, and the **Body of Transformation (化身)**.\nThe three each possess **distinct divine traces (显迹之神)**.\n\nThe **First Assembly (第一会)**:\n**Tàishàng (太上)** refines **Wood of the First and Second Heavenly Stems (甲乙木)**.\nThis is the **Assembly of the Void and Tranquility (虚坦会)**.\n**Lǎojūn (老君)** wears a **green robe (青衣)**,\nand **instructs the three thousand green-robed Daoists (度三千青衣道士)**.\nHe transmits the **Thirty-Six Chapters of the *Lingbǎo* Scripture (灵宝尊经)**—\nthe **Ninefold Transformation of the Yellow Essence (黄卷)**.\nHe leaves behind the **Ninefold Piercing Method (九转丹)**—\nthe **Yellow Sprout Piercing the Knee (黄芽穿膝)**.\n\nThe **Second Assembly of the Absolute (绝国第二会)**:\n**Shìjiā (释迦)** Buddha leaves behind\nthe **refinement of the Southern Fire of the Third and Fourth Heavenly Stems (丙丁火)**.\nHis **body is clad in the fiery monastic robe (烈火袈裟)**,\nand the **three thousand red children (赤子)**—\nthe **monks and nuns (比丘僧人)**—\nare instructed.\nHe leaves behind the **Twelve Chapters of the Great Vehicle Scripture (十二部大乘尊经)**,\nthe **Method of Striking the Ninefold Iron Drum (射九重铁鼓)**,\nand the **Piercing the Knee with Lotus Sprout (芦芽穿膝)**.\n\nThe **Third Assembly at Dragon’s Flower (龙华三会)**:\nThe **Master (夫子)** was in the **school of learning in Lǔ (鲁国之习学堂)**.\nHe refined the **Western Metal of the Seventh and Eighth Heavenly Stems (庚辛金)**.\nThe **three thousand white-robed laymen (白衣居士)** were instructed,\nand he left behind the **Ten Volumes of the *Analects* (论语)**.\nTogether with the **Ninefold Piercing of the Clear Pearl (穿九曲明珠)**,\nand the **Piercing the Knee with Lotus Sprout (芦芽穿膝)**.\n\nThe **Three Teachings (三教)** are like **three legs of a tripod (鼎三足)**.\nTheir **bodies merge into One (身同归一)**—\nneither two nor three.\nThe **Three Teachings (三教)** do not depart from the **True Dao (真道)**.\n**Illustration:** Like **one root bearing three branches (一根树生三枝)**.\n\n**Question:** Of the **Great Dao (大道)**...」\n\nThe **Five Grades of Immortals (离几等神仙)**—**Explanation:**\n\nIt is heard in *The Transmission of the Dao Collection (传道集)* that there are **five grades of immortals (五等神仙)**.\nThe first: **Not observing precepts (不持戒)**, **not abstaining from wine and meat (不断酒肉)**, **not refraining from killing (不杀生)**, **not cultivating virtue (不思善)**—these are of the **ghostly immortals (鬼仙之类)**.\n\nThe second: Those who **nurture true qi to prolong life (养真气长命)** are **Earthly Immortals (地仙)**.\n\nThe third: Those who **love warfare (好战争)** are **Sword Immortals (剑仙)**.\n\nThe fourth: Those who **sit in meditation and cultivate (打坐修行)** are **Spiritual Immortals (神仙)**.\n\nThe fifth: Those who **revere and care for teachers, elders, and parents (孝养师长父母)**, practice the **Six Perfections (六度)** and **ten thousand good deeds (万行)**, employ **skillful means to save all beings (方便救一切众生)**, **sever the Ten Evils (断除十恶)**, **refrain from killing (不杀生)**, **abstain from wine and meat (不食酒肉)**, **avoid deceit, theft, and licentiousness (邪非偷盗)**, and **align their intentions with the Heavenly Will (出意同天心)**, **upright and without bias (正直无私曲)**—these are called **Celestial Immortals (天仙)**.\n\nAt the **very beginning when virtuous intent first arises (当初初发善心处)**, that place is **auspicious (吉祥之地)**. Such are **great cultivators of virtuous practices (善法大修行人)**.\n\nLater, there are **prohibitions (禁忌之文)**. The **secret precepts (诀曰)** state:\nMen and women in the **fifth and sixth lunar months should cultivate in purity (五月六月宜清静)**—**greatly forbidden (大忌)**.\nIn the **eleventh and twelfth lunar months, they should also cultivate in purity (十一月十二月宜清静)**.\nMoreover, **the fifth and sixth months are months of great slaughter (大杀之月)**—men should **not approach women (勿近妇人)**, lest they incur **five labors and seven injuries (五劳七伤)**, **diminishing vitality and lifespan (男损性命)** or **women’s essence and vitality (女人损性者)**—this is the **essence, blood, and qi (精血气)**.\nIf diminished, it causes **left-sided paralysis and right-sided atrophy (左瘫右痪)**, **leukorrhea and bloody discharges (赤白带下)**.\nIf the **Five Phases’ true qi (五行真气)** is impaired, it is **labor (劳)**.\nIf the **Seven Treasures (七宝)** are impaired, it is **injury (伤)**.\nAll diseases have their origins (万病者，各有来处).\n\n**Question:** From whence do diseases arise?\n**Answer:** All diseases stem from **eight irregularities of the nodes (八节不正之气)**.\n\n**Question:** What are the **Eight Evils (八邪)**?\n**Answer:** The **eight irregularities** arise from **disordered yin-yang within the Eight Trigrams (八卦中阴阳不顺)**—these are the **eight nodal qi (八节中气)** that lead one into **perversity (入邪)**.\nThey are: **hunger and overindulgence (饥来痛饱)**, **cold and heat (寒极忧心)**, **exhaustion from travel and fatigue (远行困倦)**, as well as **cold and heat in the body (冷热身)**, **drunkenness (身醉)**—these are **not to be practiced (亦不可行功)**.\nIf practiced, they **transform into grave illness (变成大病也)**.\nOne should **cultivate in purity and moderation (宜清静行之)**.\nWhen practicing, **do so with restraint (行时)**.\n\nThe **tongue** gathers the **Jade Essence Elixir (玉液丹)**.\nThe **nose** gathers the **Primordial Yang Elixir (元阳丹)**.\nWithin the **kidney chamber (肾堂)**, the **Golden Elixir (金液丹)** is gathered.\nWhen **vital essence and marrow (精髓)** are full,\nAnd **bones are solidified (骨实)**,\nOne who has died **a century past (死经百年)**\nYet **tendons and bones remain unsolved (筋骨不解)**,\nIs called **the Conjoined Child’s Ring of Solidified Bones (连子环镇骨)**.\n\n**Answer:** The **twenty-four prohibitions against the Great Elixir (二十四忌大丹者)**—\nThese are the **twenty-four *qi* cycles (二十四炁)** of a year above.\nIf one **informs my teacher (令告我师)**\nAnd **seeks the wondrous method (愿求妙诀)**,\nThey must **first still their intentions (须索意自息)**,\nAnd **willingly abandon all wealth and possessions (肯舍重金净财)**.\nThe **first offering** is **laying down one’s life in alms-giving (第一舍身布施)**.\nThe **second** is **presenting flowers to the teacher (第二将花献师)**.\nThe **third** is **offering food to sustain them (第三令膳而供养)**.\n\n**Explanation:** **Laying down one’s life in alms-giving (舍身布施)**—\nIf one sees their **teacher, elders, or parents in peril (师长父母危时)**,\nThey must **sacrifice their life to save theirs (舍命求命)**.\n**Presenting flowers to the teacher (将花献师)**—\nIf the **teacher or elders require discipline (师长须打骂)**,\nThey must **meet them with joy and laughter (须将喜笑迎之)**,\nAnd **keep no trace of anger on their face (面上无嗔怒)**.\n**Offering food to sustain them (令膳而供养)**—\nWhen food has **delicious flavors (好味)**,\nThey must **first present it to the teacher (先奉其师)**.\nThis is called the **Three Offerings of Alms (三布施)**.\n\nThe **Immortal** says:\n**Steadfastness (坚者)** is the **Dao/Way (为道)**.\n**Joy (欢喜)** is **the connection (为缘)**.\nIf one **seeks the teacher without diligence (求师不勤)**,\nHow could they **ever attain the Dao (至于道)**?\n\n**Master Lü (吕翁)** says:\n**Without the teacher’s guidance (不因师指)**,\nThis matter is **hard to know (此事难知)**.\nAgain, he says:\n**One who learns yet does not understand (学而不知者)**\nIs **not one who learns yet awakens (不学而悟之)**.\n**One who learns yet does not follow the teacher (学而不从师)**\nIs called **a thief of learning (名为盗学也)**.\nThis is **the thief within the Law (是法中贼)**.\nIf one **conceals their ancestors or teachers (掩祖上师)**,\nTheir **lifespan will be shortened (得促自己寿)**,\nJust as **with ordinary people (与常人同例)**.\n**They will only exalt their own gains (自扬己得)**.\n\nThe **cutting off of practice and pretense**—\ncould such a person **ever attain the Dao/Way**?\n\nThey claim to **despise the teacher and slight the Law (法)**,\nunworthy to be called a teacher.\nBefore **studying and cultivating (修行)**,\nthey **first aid others as if aiding themselves**,\nrelying on **merit and virtue (功德)**.\n\n**Practitioners** each recognize their **ancestral lineage (祖宗科牌)**—\n**Taishang (太上)** as **ancestor (祖)**,\n**Shakyamuni (释迦)** as **lineage (宗)**,\n**Confucius (夫子)** as **lineage branch (科牌)**.\n\nSince the **three teachings (三教)** fell into stillness,\nall men and women\n**boil in the River of Love (爱河)**,\n**drift in the Sea of Suffering (苦海)**,\nenduring **torments (烦恼)**,\nsinking into the **Six Realms (六道)**—\nneither born nor extinguished,\nneither departing nor abiding.\n\nThe **three teachings’ sacred sovereigns (三教圣主)**,\nthe **three realms’ sacred mothers (三界圣母)**,\nreturn to **rescue and deliver (救度)** them.\n\nTheir **names and titles (名号)** are recorded,\ntheir **manifestations clear (显现分明)**,\ntheir **lifespan seals (寿印信)** verified.\n\n**Explanation (解曰):**\nA **fully ordained body (一身为全受戒者)** is the **record (记)**.\nA **mind awakened to understanding (心悟了达者)** is the **fire (火)**.\n\nAs the **scriptures are sought (随求经云):**\n*\"The Wish-Fulfilling Seal (如意宝印)\"*\nreveals its name from the heart—\n**ten titles (十号)** are the **Ten Good Deeds (十善)**.\n**Ten titles (十号)** mark the **adept (能人)**.\n\n1. **First title (一号元修):** *Original Cultivation*\n2. **Second title (二号转分明):** *Clarified Transformation*\n3. **Third title (三号通三界):** *Penetration of the Three Realms*\n4. **Fourth title (四号长生):** *Eternal Life*\n5. **Fifth title (五号光明现):** *Manifest Radiance*\n6. **Sixth title (六号意通):** *Mind-Transcendence*\n7. **Seventh title (七号全身主):** *Master of the Complete Body*\n8. **Eighth title (八号福禄增):** *Augmented Fortune and Longevity*\n9. **Ninth title (九号天元修):** *Celestial Primordial Cultivation*\n10. **Tenth title (十号者为能人):** *The Adept*\n\n**One title (一加性)** plus the **ten titles (十号)**—\n**immeasurable merit (无漏功德)** naturally **accomplished**.\n\nThe **three teachings (三教)**—\n**adaptively transform (随意演化) all beings**,\nyet **never depart from the Dao/Way (不离于道)**.\n\nThe ancients said:\n**\"The affairs of life and essence (性命) are profound.**\n**Practitioners endure birth, old age, sickness, and death—suffering.**\n**Yet people today do not grasp the true Dao/Way.**\n**They cling to emptiness, only to fall into emptiness,**\n**and even now cannot awaken.**\n**How could they understand the past?\"**\n\nIt is also heard in the **Dharma of Bodhidharma (达摩经):**\n*\"The past is not truly spoken of,\nthe future is not truly real.\"*\n\n**Taishang (太上)** refines the **Nine-Cycle Elixir (九转还丹)**,\n**removing illness and death (去病疾, 了生死).\"**\n\nThe Master teaches **ren (仁)**, **yi (義)**, **li (禮)**, **zhi (智)**, and **xin (信)**,\nlest people invite **karmic retribution (業)** upon themselves.\nIf one cultivates these,\nthey may also **alleviate their illnesses**.\n\n**Question:** How does one treat disease?\n**Response:** *\"The best remedy for the eyes is **eye-bright (除眼大良药)**.\"*\n**Explanation:** *\"**Longdan Xiegan (長大歡)** is the remedy.\"*\n**Response:** *\"Joy is the root of this medicine.\nConstant vexation is the root of all diseases.\nThose who remain perpetually serene are the sprouts of the **Great Dao/Way**.*\n\nYet observing today’s practitioners—\nwhether monks, Daoists, laymen, or women taking the **Five Precepts (五戒)**—\nthey still suffer from grave illnesses and impermanence.\nOr, among men and women, those with spouses or without,\nthe **elixir field (丹田)** loses its **Linggui (靈龜)**,\n**depleting true qi (耗散真氣)**.\nThe **lower dantian (下元)** grows cold and hollow,\ngradually giving rise to myriad diseases.\n\nMen who maintain **serenity (清静)** for **sixty-four days**\nwill have **semen-qi (精氣)** full.\nWomen who maintain **serenity** for **forty-nine days**\nwill have **blood-qi (血氣)** full.\n**When things reach their extreme, they return (物極者則返).**\n**Serenity returns to agitation (清為浊返).**\n**Stillness returns to motion (静为动返).**\nWhen the **mind and intent (心意)** scatter and dissipate,\nthe **nine orifices (九窍)** lose their **true qi (真氣)**.\n**Turbulent qi (氣浊)** causes women’s **menstrual flow (月水)** to increase,\nand men’s **night dreams (夜夢)** to turn toward **yin realms (阴境)**,\n**plundering the Seven Treasures and Eight Preciouses (七珍八宝).**\nThus, people fall ill.\n\n**Question:**\n\n**How does one treat *yin-ghost* afflictions?**\n\n**Answer:** Use the **Dao of the Knife and the Ruler (刀圭之法)**.\n\n**Question:** What is meant by *Knife and Ruler*?\n\n**Secret Key:** The *Knife and Ruler* is **One**—\nit has **water** and **qi**.\nIt can give birth to all things.\n**Qi** is the **Ruler**—\nit becomes **clouds**.\n**Water** becomes **rain**.\n\nAgain it is said:\n**Outgoing qi** is the **Knife**,\n**Incoming qi** is the **Ruler**.\nWhen **functioning** is verified in all things,\nthis is the **Knife and Ruler**—\nit is the **returning of aging to youth**.\n\nThe **Classical Text** says:\n*\"Fire issues from below the body,\nWater issues from above.\nWater and fire are the medicines.\"*\n\n**Secret Key:**\n*\"Reed-sprouts pierce the knee\"*—\n**Upper and Lower River Chariots (上下河车)**.\nThe **furnace’s tripod** is the **purple river chariot (紫河车)**.\nThe **Upper Chariot** refines **jing** to nourish the brain.\nWhen **fire advances**, water grows warm;\nwhen **water advances**, fire grows cool.\n**Dual movement of water and fire**—\nthis is the **gentle tempering of the lead cauldron (温温铅鼎)**.\nWhen **qi enters the cauldron**, **restoration** arises, ascending with the chariot’s fire.\nIt **scatters into the hundred meridians**,\nmoistening the skin,\ngiving luster to the body.\nThis is the **method of cultivation**.\n\n**Difficulty:** Why do the fat first grow old?\n\n**Secret Key:** The fat cultivate **externally** but not **internally**.\nTheir bones lack **marrow**,\ntheir **lower dantian** loses **true qi**—\nthus they grow weak and ill.\n\n**Cultivators of the Inner Dao** are the **seeds of ease and longevity**.\n\n**Secret Key:**\n*\"Train the dragon to coil in the golden tripod,\nLet the tiger encircle the dantian.\nThe **Zhen hexagram** summons thunder,\nThe **Xun hexagram** summons wind.\nWhen functioning, **gargle the saliva** in one great mouth,\nswallow it in three portions.\nPress down as **qi descends** three times.\nNaturally, there will be the sounds of **dragon roars and tiger howls**,\nalso able to dispel all diseases of the abdomen.\nListen with the ears—\nlike thunder striking a painted drum.\"*\n\n**The Way of Ascension and Descension**\n\n**Secret Key:**\nThe **ascending** is for elevation,\nthe **descending** for descent.\n\n**Hymn:**\nThe **True Void’s** subtle principle—none know it.\nSitting at the **Qū River’s** bend, I watch crows fly.\nEarth-shaking thunder roars, startling ghosts and demons—\nThis is the moment of **Yin-Yang’s** creative transformation.\n\n**Timing:** Before noon for the **Child**, after for the **Maiden**.\n\nBoil with **Water** and **Fire**—**Dragon** and **Tiger** follow.\n**Jīn Gōng** drinks wine, **Huáng Pó** grows drunk.\nSeize the **King**—who is he?\n**Answer:** **Jīn Gōng** is the **Divine**,\n**Huáng Pó** is the **Qi**.\nThe **Yang Qi** is the **Infant**,\nthe **Yin Qi** is the **Maiden**.\n\nThe **Azure Dragon**—this is the **liver’s qi**.\nThe **White Tiger**—this is the **lung’s qi**.\n**Kàn-Lí**—this is **essence-blood**.\n\n**Secret Key:**\nWhen practicing, sit like **Tài Mountain**,\nstand like a **jewel tower**.\nLock the **Four Gates**,\nknock fiercely at the **Mystic Pass**.\nGargle the **saliva** once—\nswallow it **three times** with ferocity.\nCross the **Kàn-Lí barrier**,\n**three times**—naturally, the **Dragon-Tiger qi** follows.\n\nAs you **move, stand, sit, or lie**,\nclose your mouth, shut your eyes.\nDo not listen with the ears,\nbut gaze inward.\nEach day, focus on the **lower dantian**—\nconcentrate and visualize.\nAs you exhale, let the **qi descend**,\nas you inhale, let the **qi ascend**.\nDo not cross the **Kàn-Lí barrier**,\nnor let it rush to the face.\nThe **Six Qi** meet at the **central pivot**—\n**Clear Qi** circulates to the right,\n**Turbulent Qi** to the left.\nEach turns **nine times**—\nthe **qi** cannot escape upward or downward.\nLeft and right merge into the **furnace**—\nthis is the **Dragon coiling, Tiger encircling**.\nThe **qi** harmonizes naturally.\n\nAgain, the **Infant and Maiden**—this is the **union of husband and wife**.\nThe **qi** gathers above the **spleen**, establishing the **furnace**—\nthis is the **Huáng Pó’s pairing**.\nAlso called the **Heaven-Earth’s harmonious union**,\nthe **Kàn-Lí’s copulation**—this is **body union without sexual union**.\n**Sexual union** is not practiced—\nthis is the **method of absolute stillness**,\nthe **thousand-fold unshaken, unmoving method**.\n\nNow, people mostly cultivate **external Dao**,\nnot the **Inner Path**.\nThey see the **past methods of the Way**.\nThe practitioner has:\nAn **outer path**—the **Great Dao’s teachings**,\nAn **inner path**—unknown to all.\n\nIn the midst of the crowd, walk three *lǐ*.\nYou see three great ravines—\nbottomless.\nHow to cross?\n**Secret Key:**\n\nThe three great ravines are the **Three Teachings**—\nthe **Three Vehicles**—\nthey give rise to the **Three Corpses**,\nestablish the **Three Treasures**,\ntranscend the **Three Realms**.\nAdvancing yet another three *lǐ*,\none sees six deep chasms—\nprogress is impossible.\nWhich gate is this?\n**Secret Key:**\nIt is the **Six Perfections** and the **Ten Thousand Practices**,\nthe **Six Senses’ purity**,\nthe **Six Thieves’ beheading**,\nthe **Six Desires’ restraint**,\nthe **Six Ladders’ planting**.\n\nAdvancing yet another three *lǐ*,\none sees the **Three Barriers**—\nthe **Barrier of Precious Purity**,\nwhere the **Seven Forests’ Corpses** abound—\nthis is the **Critical Moment of Transformation**.\nWalking three *lǐ* more,\none again sees a garden—\nthe **Garden of Discarded Fruits**.\nAn old man gazes fixedly at the garden gate.\nThose with **affinity** may pass with empty hands.\n\nAdvancing through the garden yet another three *lǐ*,\none sees a great tree upon which\na **golden ox** is tethered.\nBy the riverbank stands a **platform**—\nthe **Yellow Gold Platform** for men,\nthe **Fénhuáng Platform** for women,\nthe **Immortal’s Fishing Platform**,\nthe **Platform of Eternal Bliss and Flowers**.\nIf one is **impermanent**,\nthe **Platform of Homesickness**.\nAt the river’s mouth are three women—\nthe **ferrywoman is a demon**.\nThe boat is full of people.\nCrossing this river is **encountering the demon**.\n\nWalking three *lǐ* further,\none sees a great mountain—\nthe **Mustard Seed Mountain** (*Sūmí Shān*).\nOn its eastern slope stands a **green sheep**—\nthis is **Laozi’s qi** (*Lǎo Jūn zhī qì*).\nOn its western slope, a **white sheep**—\nthis is **the Master’s qi** (*Fūzǐ zhī qì*).\nFacing south, a **yellow sheep**—\nthis is **the Great Awakened Golden Immortal’s qi** (*Dàjué Jīnxiān zhī qì*).\nThe three sheep\nguide and escort the multitude into the mountain—\nthe **Three Yang Converging Cauldron Mountain** (*Sānyáng Jùdǐng Shān*).\n\nWithin the mountain, a city stands—\nthe **Northern City** (*Běichéng*).\nIt has four gates.\nAbove each gate hangs a plaque,\nand upon the plaque are characters:\nThe **Gate of Radiant Light** (*Kāiguāng Mén*) to the east,\nthe **Gate of Longevity** (*Chángshēng Mén*) to the west,\nthe **Gate of Golden Light** (*Jīnguāng Mén*) to the south,\nthe **Great Collapse Gate** (*Dà Lún Mén*) to the north.\nThis represents the **five sense-organs**—\neyes, ears, nose, mouth, and mind.\nEntering the four gates,\none sees four **caves of the Dao** (*dòngfǔ*).\nThe **Cave of Celestial Music** (*Tiānlè Dòng*),\nthe **Cave of White Clouds** (*Báiyún Dòng*),\nthe **Cave of the Bamboo Realm** (*Zhúguó Dòng*),\nand the **Cave of Longevity** (*Chángshēng Dòng*).\nEntering the four caves,\none sees four **temples**—\nthe **Pure Temple** (*Wújié Sì*),\nthe **Mystic Void Temple** (*Xuánkōng Sì*),\nthe **Bamboo Grove Temple** (*Zhúlín Sì*),\nand the **□□ Temple** (*[missing term] Sì*).\nWithin them dwell four **fruit-realization** (*ānuò*) **arhat** (*luóhàn*)—\n**Anāthapindika** (*Ānàshè*),\n**Sudatta** (*Sītuōshè*),\n**Sundari** (*Xūduōhàn*),\nand **Arahant** (*Āluóhàn*)—\nas the four temple masters.\nThese are the **four fruit-realized immortals** (*Sìguǒ Xiānrén*).\n\nAdvancing further, one sees five **visions** (*guàn*).\nThe **Vision of Merit and Fame** (*Gōngmíng Guàn*),\nthe **Vision of Medicine and Herbs** (*Yīyào Guàn*),\nthe **Vision of Peaceful Vitality** (*Ānyáng Guàn*),\nthe **Vision of True Suchness** (*Zhēnrú Guàn*),\nand the **Vision of Tuṣita** (*Dōushuài Guàn*).\nWithin the five visions,\nfive **palaces** appear—\nthe **Palace of the Twin Women** (*Shuāngnǚ Gōng*) is the **eyes**,\nthe **Palace of the Great Dragon** (*Dàlóng Gōng*) is the **mouth**,\nthe **Upper White Palace** (*Shàngbái Gōng*) is the **nose**,\nthe **Crystal Palace** (*Shuǐjīng Gōng*) is the **ears**,\nand the **Heavenly Scales Palace** (*Tiānchèng Gōng*) is the **mind/heart** (*xīn*).\nInside sits the **Great Tower** (*Dàlóubié*).\nTwelve breaths above and below—\nthis is the **Twelvefold Tower** (*Shíèr Chónglóu*).\nIts **Central Palace Tower** (*Zhōnggōnglóu*),\nthe **Moon Palace Tower** (*Yuègōnglóu*),\nthe **Heavenly Immortal Tower** (*Tiānxiānlóu*),\nthe **Treasury Tower** (*Qǔbǎolóu*),\nthe **Holy Well Tower** (*Shèngjǐnglóu*),\nthe **Dao-Qi Tower** (*Fǎqìlóu*),\nthe **Wondrous Sound Tower** (*Miàoyīnlóu*),\nthe **Path-Recognition Tower** (*Shìdàolóu*),\nthe **Zenith Tower** (*Chándǐnglóu*),\nthe **Mirrored Yang Tower** (*Jǐngyánglóu*),\nthe **Bell and Drum Tower** (*Zhōnggǔlóu*),\nand the **Tower of the Two Saints** (*Èrshènglóu*)\n—each year on the **twelfth day of the twelfth month**, at **twelve o’clock**,\nthe human body contains these twelve towers.\nThe **twelve towers** correspond to\nthe **twelve meridians** (*shíèr jīng*) and\nthe **twelve celestial stems** (*shíèr zhī*).\nFurther, the **four cardinal directions** reveal nine **palaces**—\nthese are the **nine orifices** (*jiǎo*) of man.\nThe **nine palace-orifices** (*jiǎogōng*) are:\nThe **Palace of Wind and Thunder** (*Fēngléi Gōng*) to the east,\nthe **Palace of Twin Forests** (*Shuānglín Gōng*),\nthe **Palace of Purple Micro** (*Zǐwēi Gōng*) to the south,\nthe **Muni Palace** (*Móuní Gōng*),\nthe **Palace of the Holy Mother** (*Shèngmǔ Gōng*) to the west,\nthe **Palace of Huìluó** (*Huìluó Gōng*),\nthe **Palace of the Northern Dharma** (*Fán Gōng*) to the north,\nthe **Crystal Palace** (*Shuǐjīng Gōng*),\nand the **Central Palace of Peace** (*Ān Gōng*) at the center.\nThis is called the **Nine Palaces** (*Jiǔgōng*),\njust as the earth is divided into **nine regions** (*jiǔ zhōu*).\nFurther, the **Microcosmic Palaces** (*Wéifǔ Yuán*) are counted—\na total of **ten states** (*zhōu*).\nThese are also **ten realms** (*guó*).\nThe **Realm of the Fire Ancestor** (*Jiāozǔ Guó*),\nthe **Realm of Muni** (*Móuní Guó*),\nthe **Realm of Blooming** (*Kāihuā Guó*),\nthe **Realm of Deer Crag** (*Lùyán Guó*),\nthe **Golden Realm** (*Jīnsè

**Realm of Double Yang** (*Chóngyáng Guó*).\nThe **ten realms** are the **ten stages** (*dì*) of **dharma-realization** (*shìdì*).\nWithin each stage, a **Tài Mountain** (*Shān*).\nThe body contains four **great oceans** (*hǎi*):\n**saliva** (*jīn*) is the **Eastern Ocean** (*Dōnghǎi*),\n**blood** (*xuè*) is the **Southern Ocean** (*Nánhǎi*),\n**marrow** (*suǐ*) is the **Western Ocean** (*Xīhǎi*),\nand **qi** (*qì*) is the **Northern Ocean** (*Běihǎi*).\nThere are also nine **islands** (*zhōu*)—\nthe **small intestine** (*xiǎocháng*) is the **island**.\nFurther, there are five
