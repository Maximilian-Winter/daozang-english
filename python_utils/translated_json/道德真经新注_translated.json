  "full_translation": "**New Annotation of the *Dao De Jing* (道德真经新注)**\n\n**Title:** New Annotation of the *Dao De Jing*\n**Author:** Annotated by Li Yue (李约) of the Tang Dynasty\n**Volume:** Four scrolls\n**Source Text:** From the *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), *Dongshen* (洞神) section, *Yujue* (玉诀) category\n**Original Text:** No chapter titles in the original\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the New Annotation of the *Dao De Jing***\n\nThe Dao of Nature is tranquil, and thus all things under Heaven are born within it.\nHumans are the sovereign of all things, and thus they, together with Heaven and Earth, constitute the Three Powers (*san cai* 三才).\nWhen the Venerable Lord Lao existed in the Western Zhou, he upheld the *Dao* and *virtue* (*de*) to rescue the customs of his age.\nThe *Dao* is the pure, natural Way.\n*Virtue* (*de*) is that which is lost through neglect but attained through cultivation—this is called *virtue*.\n\nThus it is said: The *Dao* is vast, Heaven is vast, Earth is vast, and the Sage-King is vast—these are the Four Great Ones within the realm.\nFor the Sage-King governs by embodying the three natural mysteries: conforming to Earth, conforming to Heaven, and conforming to the *Dao*.\nWhen the realm attains this, it is in peace, and this is called *virtue*.\n\nNow, when speaking of \"human,\" it is but a part of the whole—\nThus: *\"Human conforms to Earth\"*—like Earth’s impartial bearing.\n*\"Conforms to Heaven\"*—like Heaven’s impartial covering.\n*\"Conforms to the Dao\"*—like the Dao’s impartial generation and transformation.\nThis is as in the examples of *\"Sovereign as Sovereign, Minister as Minister, Father as Father, Child as Child.\"*\n\nLater scholars, failing to grasp the Sage’s intent, transmitted erroneous interpretations. The twenty schools of annotation all claim:\n*\"Human conforms to Earth, Earth conforms to Heaven, Heaven conforms to the Dao, the Dao conforms to Nature.\"*\nThis makes five great ones within the realm—contradicting the text and losing its true teaching!\n\nCould it be that the Sage-King only conforms to Earth and not to Heaven or the *Dao*?\nMoreover, if Earth conforms to Heaven, Heaven to the *Dao*, and the *Dao* to Nature, the logic becomes distant and convoluted.\nOnce the source is distorted, the branches grow confused.\nSome revere it as an elixir scripture, others as a doctrine of emptiness.\nScholars do not say that the *Six Classics* came before the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, but this is mere vulgar talk—\nThey do not know that the *Six Classics* are but the branches and leaves of the Yellow Emperor’s teachings.\n\nI, in my youth, grasped the essentials, and thus I clarify and expound upon them.\nThis is the art of purifying the mind, nurturing *qi*, and securing the family and the state.\n\n---\n**New Annotation of the *Dao De Jing*, Volume One**\n*Annotated by Li Yue* (李约注)\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* begins thus:\n\nThe *Dao*’s nature is spontaneous and still,\nAnd thus Heaven and Earth give birth to all things.\nThings endure long before decaying,\nYet cultivation makes them revert to the *Dao*—\nHence it is called the *Dao*.\n\nIn all, there are thirty-seven chapters.\nThe *Dao* that can be spoken of,\nIf spoken of, is not the ultimate *Dao*.\nThe ultimate *Dao* is formless.\nIt is called \"dimly luminous, faintly obscure.\"\nThe name that can be named,\nIf named, is not the ultimate name.\nThe ultimate name is nameless.\nIt is called \"great\" and \"passing.\"\n\nWithout name, the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nHere lies the subtlest essence of the *Dao*,\nSeeking expression yet transcending speech,\nNaming yet remaining beyond names.\n\nThe *Dao* gave birth to Heaven and Earth before humanity existed.\nWithout humanity, who could have named the *Dao*?\nWith name, all things take form.\nOnce the Three Powers are complete,\nAnd myriad things assume their shapes,\nThe nurturing principle is clear,\nAnd the names of mother and child are established.\nThe Sage thus begins to teach.\n\nAlways without desire, one beholds its mystery;\nAlways with desire, one sees its flaws.\nFlaws are its boundaries.\nHumanity’s greatest concern lies in desire and its absence.\nThus, those with desire do not wander in the *Dao*,\nWhile those who forget it alone perceive its subtlety.\n\nThese two—same in origin, different in name—\nIn the *Dao* are one,\nYet in things are two.\nThey are called \"mysterious.\"\nMysterious, like blackness.\nIf five colors are placed in darkness,\nThey cannot be distinguished.\nTo make disparate names unite as one,\nThis is called \"mysterious within mysterious.\"\nThe more mysterious, the more it cannot be fathomed—\nThe gateway to all wonders.\n\nThus, one may reach the source of all transformations.\nThe world has its rulers.\nAll know beauty when it is called beauty—\nThen ugliness arises;\nIf beauty differs from the common view,\nIs it not already ugliness?\nAll know goodness when it is called goodness—\nThen wickedness arises;\nIf goodness stands apart from the multitude,\nThen it is truly wickedness.\n\nThus, being and non-being generate each other,\nOpposites give rise to one another.\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nSuccessive transformations.\nLong and short define each other,\nVisible together.\nHigh and low lean upon each other,\nGiving rise to mutual strife.\nSounds and voices harmonize,\nYet do not act alone.\nBefore and after follow each other—\nDistinct yet undetermined.\n\nThese are all proofs of the *Dao*’s workings above.\nHence, the Sage must not speak as others do.\nHe acts in non-action,\nPlacing his mind in perfect stillness.\nHe teaches without words,\nSetting his own conduct as the model for all.\n\nAll things arise without his bidding;\nHe does not interfere, so nothing is lost.\nHe acts without claiming,\nFor what is done is his natural course.\nHe gives birth without possessing,\nLetting things complete themselves—\nThis is his power; what need has he of it?\nHe acts without relying on it,\nFor what is achieved is his virtue—\nWhat need has he to boast of it?\n\nWhen virtue is fulfilled yet he does not dwell upon it,\nThis is why he is not abandoned.\nWithout effort yet in accord with principle,\nThis is called \"not dwelling,\"\nAnd virtue naturally accomplished—\nThis is called \"not being abandoned.\"\n\nHe does not exalt the worthy,\nSo the people do not contend;\nIf he does not exalt his own worth,\nWho would dare to contend with him?\nHe does not prize difficult-to-obtain goods,\nSo the people do not steal;\nIf he does not covet what others desire,\nAll would naturally turn from it—\nWho then would steal?\n\nHe does not show what is desirable,\nSo the heart remains undisturbed.\nTo all who oppose him,\nHe forgets them utterly—\nThen the heart will naturally be still.\n\nThus, the Sage embodies these principles:\nEmpty his mind, and external things will not enter within.\nFill his belly, and the Original Unity will not leave without.\nWeaken his resolve, and he will think only of softness.\nStrengthen his bones, and he will preserve his essence.\n\nAlways make people ignorant and without desire,\nAnd this is the principle—\nThus, humanity returns to simplicity.\nLet the wise not dare to act,\nAnd those who see the return to simplicity will strive to align with it.\n\nAct in non-action,\nAnd nothing will remain ungoverned.\nDo not lose non-action,\nAnd you will not suffer from disorder.\n\nThe *Dao* is open yet responds to all things,\nEmptying himself to meet their needs.\nSome do not fulfill their purpose,\nSo virtue is complete when its time arrives.\n\nDeep and still, like the source of all things.\nDeeply tranquil, unfathomable—\nThus, it appears as the teacher of all classes.\n\nDulling their sharpness,\nHe restrains the grasping of gain.\nUnraveling their entanglements,\nHe resolves all grudges and resentments.\nBlending their brightness,\nHe harmonizes their clarity.\nUniting their dust,\nHe enters their obscurity.\n\nGleaming yet indistinct,\nLike something that may or may not exist.\nHis use is without differentiation,\nHis nature without mixture.\nI do not know whose child he is,\nBut I recognize his ability—\nNo one knows his parent.\nHe resembles the state before the Emperor.\n\nThe Emperor is the origin of all things,\nAnd all transformations follow after—\nOnly the *Dao* can dwell before him.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent;\nBenevolence is favor.\nFavor arises from the heart,\nAnd Heaven and Earth have no heart—\nHow could they be benevolent?\nThey treat all things as fodder for horses.\nFodder is grass;\nRepayment springs from sentiment,\nAnd fodder has no sentiment—\nHow could there be repayment?\n\nThe Sage is not benevolent,\nFollowing the *Dao* of Heaven and Earth’s heartlessness,\nYet he empties his mind and rests in simplicity—\nWhat need has he of benevolence?\nHe treats the people as fodder for horses.\nThe people, like fodder, are without sentiment,\nThus he forgets the Emperor’s power beneath them.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nIt is like a bellows.\nThe bellows has no bottom,\nYet when struck, it never ceases to produce heat—\nAt home, it uses wind to fan the flames.\nThe *zhi* is like a flute;\nSkilled musicians blow into it to make music.\nBoth are empty within yet without sentiment,\nThus they respond endlessly to demands.\n\nHeaven and Earth are like this,\nHence they are not benevolent.\n\n「Empty yet never yielding, yielding is exhaustion.\nEmpty, thus never exhausted.\nMove and it overflows—\nHence the more it moves, the more it responds.\nMany words bring exhaustion,\nBetter to guard the center.\n\nWith intent to speak, then there is a time when it fails;\nEmpty within yet responding, then there is no day when it is exhausted.\nThe *Gu* spirit does not die—\nWithin the *Gu*, empty, it can echo with sound in reply.\nWho knows the one that answers the sound?\nSince it is unknown and unfathomable,\nIt is called the spirit—spirit answers, everlasting, why?\n\nHumans can empty their hearts,\nThen nothing fails to respond—\nAs the spirit never departs the body, everlasting.\n\nThis is called the *Xuan Dan*.\n*Xuan* is profound darkness;\n*Dan* is the female.\n\nThe female dwells in secluded chambers—\nThis is the *Xuan Dan*.\nIts nature is soft and tranquil,\nNot harming within from without,\nThus it can govern the unfathomable spirit within itself.\n\nAgain, the *Xuan* is the nose, the *Dan* is the mouth—\nEmpty and spacious, inhaling and exhaling the primordial *qi*,\nThe root of yin and yang.\n\nThe gate of the *Xuan Dan*—\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nTo act as the *Xuan Dan*,\nOne may call it the gate to attaining the *Dao*.\nOnce the *Dao* is attained,\nThen the *Dao* becomes the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nEndless and subtle, the *Dao*’s body\nSeems unable to sustain itself,\nYet it exists eternally, from past to future.\nUse it without exhaustion—\nThough subtle, its application\nNever declines in weariness.\n\nIf humans can attain it,\nThen their nature is whole, their spirit sovereign—\nAchieving boundless longevity.\n\nAgain, it speaks of the *tu nà* method.\nHeaven is vast, Earth is enduring—\nNow, the market has not yet lacked it.\nHeaven and Earth endure long,\nBecause they do not generate themselves—\nThus they attain eternal life.\nThe reason they attain eternal life,\nIs that they do not cultivate their own life yet possess it.\n\nThus the Sage can emulate Heaven and Earth.\nRetreat behind his own body, yet his body advances—\nThe reason he surpasses others,\nIs that he excels through self-effacement.\n\nExclude his own body, yet his body remains—\nThe reason he is not endangered,\nIs that he can diminish himself.\nNot because he lacks selfishness,\nBut because he can fulfill others’ selfishness—\nOthers’ selfishness may not succeed,\nYet his own selfishness is already fulfilled.\n\nThe highest virtue is like water.\nThe most virtuous person follows water’s nature.\nWater benefits all things,\nAll things receive its nourishment.\nYet it does not contend—\nIt excels in humility and compliance.\nWhere people detest,\nThe lowest flows—\nAll the world’s detestations gather there,\nPeople avoid it,\nWater alone dwells there.\nThus it nears the *Dao*.\n*Ji* means proximity.\nReside in the best land—\nQuiet dwelling is best in land.\nHeart is best in depth—\nCalm the heart, best in depth.\nGive with virtue—\nBestow giving, virtue excels.\nSpeak with trust—\nFulfill speech, trust excels.\nGovern with skill—\nRule with governance, skill excels.\nDo with ability—\nAct with ability, ability excels.\nMove with timing—\nMotion with timing, timing excels.\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\nThus it has no blame.\n*You* means fault—\nWater’s nature is such,\nVirtuous people follow it,\nThus they dwell in faultless ground.\n\nHold and fill it,\nBetter to stop and rest in the center.\n*Yi* means cease.\nCarry and sharpen it,\nIt cannot be long preserved.\nGrind until it is sharpest,\nPreserve its unbreakable nature—\nThis has never been heard before.\n*Chuài* means to grind,\n*Ruì* means thinness.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can guard them;\nProfit brings harm—\nAccumulate, and it will kill the body—\nWho says they can guard?\n\nRich and noble yet proud,\nThey invite their own misfortune.\nHigh in station yet arrogant,\nDisaster gathers itself—\nHow can they blame others?\n\nFunction accomplished,\nAffairs fulfilled,\nRetreat the body—\nThis is the *Dao* of Heaven.\nTo seek function and achieve it,\nTo plot affairs and see them through,\nThen one should retreat the body,\nNot dwelling in extreme heights—\nThis aligns with Heaven’s *Dao* of moderation.\n\nNurture the *hun* and preserve the *pò*—\nCan one not depart from unity?\nHuman life must nurture the *hun*—\nThe *hun* is the yang spirit,\nThe yang spirit desires life.\nThe *pò* is the yin ghost,\nThe yin ghost desires death.\nThus, the *Laozi* teaches the method of guarding and nurturing,\nSo that the spirit does not recklessly depart and bring calamity.\n\nThe method of guarding and nurturing,\nHas no greater principle than preserving unity.\nUnity means singular focus—\nPreserve a focused heart,\nThus the *pò* has no way to leave the body,\nIn harmony with the previous state.\n\nConcentrate the *qi* to achieve softness—\nCan one be like an infant?\nTo concentrate and nourish harmonious *qi*,\nCan one reach the softness of a newborn’s body?\n\nPurify and cast off the profound vision—\nCan one be without blemish?\nProfound vision is the heart—\nThe heart is clear and penetrating,\nThough in the depths, it can survey and know.\nAll people have many desires,\nExhausting themselves without measure,\nThus flaws arise,\nUnable to illuminate clearly—\nHence the command to use the *Dao* to wash and purify,\nRemoving its dust and burdens.\n\nLove the people, govern the state—\nCan one achieve *wu wei*?\nIf one’s body is cultivated,\nOne has never heard of their state not being well-ordered.\nThe people are the root of the state—\n*Wu wei* is the key to governance.\nIf one attains the key to governance,\nAnd applies it to their state,\nThis is called loving the people and governing the state.\n\nThe gates of Heaven open and close—\nCan one act as the female?\nHeaven aids those with virtue,\nAnd the loving-people ruler uses the female principle—\nQuiet and still, never straying from the *Dao*—\nThus the gates of Heaven remain open,\nGranting them blessings and longevity,\nOtherwise, they close.\n\nBright and all-pervading—\nCan one be without knowing?\nThere is supreme virtue like the sun,\nIlluminating all—\nCan one make all beneath it unaware?\nBorn yet not possessed—\nIf possessed, then those beneath know.\nAct yet not rely—\nIf relied upon, then it is not the Sage.\nLong yet not domineering—\nThings do not know where life originates.\nThis is called profound virtue—\nThe utmost of mysterious operation.\n\nThirty spokes converge at one hub—\nWhen the hub is absent, the wheel’s use exists.\nInitially, the wheel was formed,\nWith a single spoke as its rim—\nWithout thirty spokes, it could not revolve and move.\nThe wheel’s utility,\nDepends on the emptiness within its frame.»\n\nThe utility arises from its non-existence—\nThus motion is accomplished.\n\nClay is shaped into vessels—\nWhen their emptiness is honored, their use is realized.\nIn ancient times, vessels were formed by kneading clay and firing it,\nAnd thus jars and bowls were made.\nHence, the vessel’s utility\nAlso depends on the void within.\n\nHonoring non-existence,\nRegulates one’s food and drink.\n\nDoors and windows are carved for dwellings—\nWhen their emptiness is honored, their use is realized.\nWhen constructing a dwelling,\nOne cuts into hills and mounds to form walls,\nCarves doors for entry and exit,\nOpens windows for light,\nAnd people dwell within—\nBecause the center is empty.\n\nHonoring non-existence,\nAverts stagnation and rigidity.\n\nThus, having is for utility—\nFormed things rely on emptiness for their use.\nEmptiness is for utility.\n\nThe Dao of void and non-being\nManifests its use through material forms.\n\nFive colors blind the eyes—\nGazing long, they dim until one sees nothing,\nThus, blindness ensues.\nFive tones deafen the ears—\nListening prolonged, they dull until one hears nothing,\nThus, deafness ensues.\nFive flavors dull the palate—\nTasting without cease, one loses distinction,\nThus, insensitivity ensues.\nHunting and chasing drive the mind to madness—\nPursuing foxes and hares, exhausted without rest,\nThus, the mind’s madness ensues.\nRare treasures obstruct action—\nRisking life for precious things,\nNo progress in virtue is made,\nThus, obstruction ensues.\n\nTherefore, the Sage guides the Sage’s conduct\nTo suppress these five excesses.\nThese five excesses—\nAll people eagerly pursue them,\nYet do not know when to retreat,\nSo the Sage teaches the meaning of sufficiency.\n\nSufficiency for the belly, not for the eyes—\nThe eyes are insatiable; the Sage does not indulge them.\nThe belly knows contentment; the Sage provides for it.\nThus, discard the former, embrace the latter.\nDiscard the eyes—\nThey gaze outward—hence, \"the former.\"\nEmbrace the belly—\nIt is filled within—hence, \"the latter.\"\n\nHonor and disgrace are like sudden alarm—\nWhen honored, fear disgrace may follow.\nWhen dishonored, reflect on faults.\nThis is called \"honor and disgrace as alarm.\"\n\nTreasure great calamity as the body—\nTreasure the body and calamity arises.\nTreasure calamity and the body is lost—\nThus, no calamity remains.\n\nWhat is meant by \"honor and disgrace as alarm\"?\nHonor is called \"honor,\" disgrace is called \"disgrace.\"\nHonor is inferior; disgrace arises from honor,\nThus, disgrace is superior—\nLike Ji Pi’s analogy of piled firewood.\n\nGaining it is like alarm—\nFear that disgrace may come.\nLosing it is like alarm—\nReflect on past mistakes.\nThis is called \"honor and disgrace as alarm.\"\n\nWhat is meant by \"treasure great calamity as the body\"?\nMy great calamity arises because I have a body.\nTreasure the body, and troubles beset every path.\nWhen I have no body, what calamity remains?\nWhen I do not cherish the body,\nForgetting its form,\nI lose where calamity originates.\n\nThus, treasure the body for the sake of the world—\nIf one can entrust the world to it,\nOne who treasures the body as ruler\nWill seek fine clothes and rich foods,\nExhausting the people’s resources—\nWho would not resent this?\nEntrusting the world to such a one\nIs not enduring.\n\nThus, love the body for the sake of the world—\nIf one can entrust the world to it,\nA ruler who loves the body\nWill guard against disgrace,\nNot troubling the people—\nAll will willingly attach themselves,\nEntrusting the world to him.\nTo entrust is to suppress and bestow.\n\nSeeing it yet not perceiving is called *yí* (平).\nThe eyes can discern colors,\nBut cannot grasp the Dao—\nThus, the seer gains only its flatness.\n*Yí* is evenness—\nA hazy indistinction, no variation seen.\n\nHearing it yet not hearing is called *xī* (希).\nThe ears can hear sounds,\nBut cannot listen to the Dao—\nThus, the hearer gains only its scarcity.\n*Xī* is absence, or paucity—\nSome never attain it, others do.\n\nSeizing it yet not obtaining is called *wēi* (微).\nThe hands can grasp form,\nBut cannot grasp the Dao—\nThus, the seeker gains only its subtlety.\n*Wēi* is marvelous—\nSeemingly near, yet lost again.\n\nThese three cannot be forced or questioned,\nThus, they merge into one.\n\nAbove, it is not bright—\nBelow, it is not dark.\nAll things are bright above and dark below,\nYet the Dao is high without above,\nThus, it is not bright,\nLow without below,\nThus, it is not dark.\n\nEndless yet nameless—\nReturning to nothingness.\nEndless is long and unbroken,\nYet when its substance is demanded and named,\nIt returns to nothingness.\n\nThis is called the \"form of non-form\"—\nSince it cannot be named,\nIt is truly formless,\nYet called \"form\"—\nWhy so?\n\nThough the Dao’s clarity is not its form,\nIt truly generates from myriad forms,\nThus, it is called \"form.\"\n\nThe image of non-being—\nNot like the forms of things,\nWhich can be seen.\n\nThis is called *hǔhuǎng* (惚恍).\n*Huǎng* is presence,\n*Hǔ* is absence—\nTo say it is, is wrong;\nTo say it is not, is wrong,\nThus, it is named *hǔhuǎng*.\n\nApproach it, yet see no head—\nIt has no coming.\nFollow it, yet see no tail—\nIt has no going.\n\nHold fast to the ancient Dao\nTo govern the present.\nThough not seen or heard,\nNor known through seeking,\nIt has existed since antiquity—\nCalled the Dao.\nNow, to grasp and uphold it,\nNo method has been heard.\nThe method lies in a vacant heart—\nIf the heart can truly vacate,\nThe Dao will come of itself,\nThen grasp it to govern all things—\nNothing will escape proper order.\n\nTo know the ancient beginning—\nThis is called the \"memorial of the Dao.\"\nThe Dao is the origin of antiquity;\nIf one knows and practices it,\nThis is called attaining the principles of transformation.\n\nIn ancient times, the virtuous scholar—\nThere were those who spoke of ancient times,\nWho practiced the Dao as scholars.\nSubtle, mysterious, and penetrating,\nDeep beyond comprehension.\nAlone they explored the utmost Dao,\nExhausting its subtlety,\nTheir walls towering and profound,\nImpenetrable to sight.\nBecause it cannot be known,\nThey forcefully describe its appearance:\nThe Dao dwells in the heart,\nNot manifest in expression,\nThus, people cannot recognize it.\n\n「When one seeks to transform and guide others,\nTherefore, one forcefully describes its form.\nThe form is used to awaken understanding of things.\n\nIt is like crossing a river in winter—\nIn the winter season, solid ice must form,\nYet those who cross the river have no fear of slipping and drowning,\nBecause they are at ease.\nIt is also like fearing one’s neighbors—\nThough dwelling in seclusion, one remains untouched,\nYet still one fears as if traces might be left behind.\n\nOne conceals oneself like a fugitive,\nDreading that neighbors might know.\nOne appears dignified like a guest,\nFor one’s actions are without contrivance,\nLike a guest’s natural bearing.\n\nOne is fluid like ice about to thaw,\nYet does not cling or stagnate,\nLike water that floats freely.\n\nOne is sincere like uncarved wood,\nYet one fears it might drift without returning,\nAnd so one contemplates returning to its origin.\nEmpty like a valley—\nA valley’s hollow space holds all.\nOne is turbid like mud,\nYet not merely clear.\nWho can settle the turbid with steady stillness to gradually become clear?\nOnly the virtuous scholar.\n\nWho can remain tranquil through prolonged movement to gradually bring forth life?\nTo rest in what is already at rest,\nYet to come and go in turn—\nThis is the Way of the virtuous scholar.\n\nThose who adhere to this Way\nDo not seek to be full.\nFor fullness leads to loss.\nOnly by not being full\nCan one preserve what is newly formed.\nOnly by not being full\nCan one preserve what is newly formed.\n\nTo attain utmost emptiness,\nTo steadfastly uphold stillness—\nSteadfastness means depth.\nWhen one seeks to gather the Dao within oneself,\nOne must first attain its emptiness.\nIf emptiness reaches its utmost,\nThe Dao will surely come of itself into one’s being.\n\nAll things arise together,\nI observe their return.\nI fear people may not yet believe\nThat upholding stillness is the path to attaining the Dao,\nSo I use this analogy to clarify it.\n\nWhen all things move and arise,\nI observe their decline and fall,\nFor all vital qi inevitably returns to stillness.\n\nThings are myriad and flourishing,\nAll return to their roots.\nThings are myriad and lush in growth until autumn.\nAt the intersection of autumn and winter,\nNo living essence fails to return to its root—\nBecause the root is stillness.\n\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nIf one moves, one cannot return to life.\nStillness is called \"returning to the vital breath.\"\nBy the tenth month, the qi of all things returns to their roots.\nAfter the Winter Solstice,\nA single Yang arises,\nAnd then buds and movement begin.\nThis cycle of return is the root of Nature’s Way.\n\nReturning to the vital breath is called \"constancy\";\nConstancy is the Dao of life.\nTo know constancy is called \"clarity\";\nClarity is knowledge.\nTo not know constancy is to act recklessly, bringing disaster.\nIf one is ignorant of constancy,\nAll one’s actions will be in vain,\nAnd one will surely fail to meet with good fortune.\n\nTo know constancy is to embrace universality;\nAn empty heart can know constancy,\nThus one can embrace all.\nUniversality is fairness;\nFairness means to embrace without exclusion,\nWhich is to act without selfishness.\n\nFairness is called \"sovereign\";\nWithout selfishness, all things will return and attach themselves.\nSovereignty is called \"heavenly\";\nThe sovereign Way has no bias,\nLike the heaven’s covering all.\n\nHeaven is the Dao;\nIts function is immeasurably great,\nYet it can also forget itself.\n\nThe Dao endures forever;\nIf one forgets the sovereign’s principle,\nHow can one’s blessings and longevity be feared?\nOne’s body may perish, yet no harm befalls.\n\nLove extends even to the Sweet Osage,\nYet will one wash away its people?\nTo say that the ultimate person\nEstablishes deeds, affairs, teachings, and laws,\nEnduring through all ages—\nWhen the body departs, the spirit remains.\n\n**The New Annotations of the *Zhenjing of Dao and Virtue* conclude, Volume One. Volume Two begins.**\n\n**The *Dao De Jing* (Lower Section) – Li Ye’s Annotation**\n\nThe Sage-King knows what is beneath;\nThe ancient rulers were known only by their subjects—\nThey never issued decrees.\n\nNext, they were loved and praised;\nThey were loved because of their virtue,\nPraised because of their benevolence.\n\nNext, they were feared and reviled;\nThe upright feared them,\nThe deceitful reviled them.\n\nWhen trust is lacking, distrust arises.\nAt first, they lured with falsehood—\nThis is why trust was lacking.\nLater, they showed sincerity—\nYet people still did not believe them.\n\nThey still valued words.\nNot knowing that words should be valued less than trust,\nThey reached this ruin—\nYet they still valued words,\nSo the pure and harmonious winds could not prevail.\n\nWhen deeds were accomplished and affairs settled,\nThe people said, *\"It happened naturally.\"*\nBecause there were no teachings or laws,\nThis custom arose.\n\nWhen the Great Dao declined, there were benevolence and righteousness;\nThe Great Dao did not decline to avoid benevolence and righteousness,\nBut because benevolence and righteousness were established,\nThe Great Dao had no choice but to decline—\nFor it was the age of abandoning the root to exalt the branches.\n\nWhen wisdom arose, great deceit followed;\nWisdom did not arise to foster great deceit,\nBut great deceit could not help but arise—\nBecause it relied on traces to take form.\n\nWhen the six kinsfolk were not harmonious, filial piety and kindness emerged;\nOn days when fathers were kind and sons filial,\nWould there be the fame of Zeng Shen?\nWhen states were chaotic and corrupt, loyal ministers arose.\nIn times when rulers were virtuous and ministers upright,\nWhere would the resolve of Bi Gan come from?\n\nTo abandon the sage and discard wisdom,\nThe people’s benefits increase a hundredfold;\nTo abandon the sage and discard wisdom\nIs to have no laws or decrees.\nWith no laws or decrees,\nThe people need not fear transgression.\nWhen the people fear no transgression,\nThey act freely in life—\nCompared to the time of Han Xin’s calculations,\nTheir gains are not merely a hundredfold.\n\nTo abandon benevolence and discard righteousness,\nThe people return to natural filial piety and kindness;\nTo abandon the artificial benevolence and righteousness,\nThe world does not uphold the unattainable laws—\nAll return to natural filial piety and kindness.\n\nTo abandon cleverness and discard profit,\nThieves and robbers vanish.\nTo abandon extraordinary cleverness,\nThen profit is balanced.\nWhen profit is balanced,\nThen the people each have enough.\nWhen the people each have enough,\nWho would become thieves and robbers?\n\nThese three [principles] are insufficient for cultivation,\nSo four more are added.\n*Seeing* the unadorned and discarding stains—\nEmbracing simplicity, guarding the root—\nFewer desires, forgetting self—\nFew desires.\nLosing the paired—\nDiscarding artificial distinctions.\n\nTo abandon learning and have no worries.\nIf one studies worldly affairs,\nEvery action brings regret and hesitation—\nThus, there is worry.\n*\"Yes\"* and *\"Ah\"*—how far apart are they?\n*\"Yes\"* and *\"Ah\"* arise from the mouth,\nYet bring changes of joy and anger.\nGood and evil—how far apart are they?\nGood and evil arise from the heart—\nHow distant is it from the Hu-Yueh divide?\n\nWhat people fear, one must fear.\nWhat people fear, one must truly fear—\nIf not, calamity will arise.\n\nWild and endless—\nThe learning of the world is like this:\nThe natural disposition grows daily more desolate,\nWith no end in sight.\n\nThe multitude bustles and thrives,\nPursuing desires like feasting on the grandest sacrifice.\nLike ascending the Spring Terrace—\nTheir lustful desires only grow.\n\nI alone stand in dread, as yet unmanifest,\nLike an infant before it speaks.\nLaozi said:\n*\"I have long abandoned worldly learning.\nNow, even seeing it, I am filled with dread—\nIt has not yet taken form,\nLike an infant before it speaks,\nNot yet knowing human intentions.\"*\n\nSteadfast and unyielding—\nAs if having nowhere to return.\n*Steadfast* means riding what one rides.\nThe Sage has no intent—\nWhatever is encountered, they ride it forward.\nHow would they know to distinguish this from that\nAnd call it returning?\n\nThe multitude all have excess—\nIn worldly learning, they seem to have surplus strength.\nI alone seem abandoned.\nOnly I, in worldly learning,\nSeem as if divine insufficiency has left me forgotten.\n\nI am the heart of the foolish—\nNo, it is not.\nPure and unadorned—\nThe simple and unrefined have not yet scattered—\nThus, it is called *pure*.\nThe vulgar are sharp and discerning,\nExhibiting rigid friendships.\nI alone am muddled—\nAs if lacking ability.\nThe vulgar are bright and clear,\nBoasting knowledge.\nI alone seem dim—\nAs if hiding the essence.\nVast as the sea, tranquil and solitary—\nLike a hollow boat drifting on the great waters,\nNever stopping or anchoring.\n\nThe multitude all have purpose—\nThus, they are not at ease.\nI alone seem dull and crude—\nI alone do not know of worldly affairs,\nMy stupidity like that of the border folk.\n\nI alone differ from others—\nIn form, like the crowd;\nIn heart, wandering beyond things.\n\nYet I value nourishment from the Mother.\nThe Mother is the Dao.\nNourishment is sustenance.\nWhat makes me differ from others\nIs that I seek sustenance from the Dao.\nThe Dao, because I can abandon worldly learning,\nOften nourishes me with the original harmony and subtle qi.\n\nThe vast virtue’s capacity—\nOnly the Dao follows it.\n*Vast* means extreme.\n*Capacity* means reception.\n*Follows* means to conform.\nThose with virtue,\nTheir hearts pure and empty,\nOnly receive the supreme Dao\nAnd follow it in action.\n\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nIs only vague and indistinct.\nThe Dao, though vague and indistinct, is not without form—\n*Vague* means absence.\n*Indistinct* means presence.\n*Within* refers to the heart.\n*Form* means the boundless form.\nIf the heart is vague—\nWithout things—\nYet becomes indistinct—\nWith desires—\nThen the Dao transforms into boundless form.\n\nIf the heart is indistinct—\nWith desires—\nYet returns to vague—\nWithout desires—\nThen the Dao transforms back into wondrous things,\nDeeply dwelling within the heart.\n\nProfound and dark—\nWithin it is essence.\n*Profound* means deep.\n*Dark* means obscure.\n*Essence* is the Dao’s wonder.\nSpeaking of the Dao’s wondrous qi,\nEntering and exiting all things,\nYet unseen—\n\nThe **sovereign**—\nOnly the one with a **void-heart** can attain it.\n\nIts **essence** is most **true**,\nObtaining the **unborrowed essence**,\nThus becoming a **True Person**.\n\nWithin it is **faith**.\nIf one’s **sincerity** can void the heart,\nThen the **essence** will respond and not be lost.\n\nFrom ancient times to now,\nIts name does not fade—\nAncient is just like the present,\nAnd the present person, sensing its response,\nKnows that the ancients’ sensing was likewise.\n\n**Observe the multitude of beginnings**—\n*Observe* means to **search and verify**.\n*Beginnings* mean the **first stirrings**.\n\nSearching and verifying ancient origins,\nThose who attained the Dao were many—\nEach and all obtained it through **desirelessness**.\n\nHow do I know this of the multitude of beginnings?\nThus:\n\nThe **Laozi** said:\nHow do I know those who attain the Dao are such?\nBy their **highest actions**, I recognize them.\n\n**Bend** and you are **whole**—\nNothing is unyielding,\nWho can harm you?\n**Crooked** makes you **straight**—\n**Flexing** yet silent,\nUltimately, it will **self-express**.\n\n**Low** and you are **full**—\nOnly the **lowest of the low**,\nAnd the world’s heart is drawn to them.\n\n**Worn** and you are **renewed**—\nNot clinging to what you’ve gained,\nOnly then can you **advance and refine**.\n\n**Few** and you **attain**—\nNot dividing your **intent**.\n**Many** and you are **bewildered**.\n\nThey love to **follow the crowd**—\nThus the **sage** embraces **Oneness** as the **model for all under heaven**,\nOnly adhering to the Dao,\nAnd none under heaven dare defy.\n\nNot **self-revealing**, so **clear**;\n**Hide** your **capacity**, and it will **inevitably shine**.\nNot **self-righteous**, so **illuminated**;\n**Lose** your **self-righteousness**, and it will **become apparent**.\n\nNot **self-proud**, so **long-lasting**;\n**Offering** your **shortcomings**, your **length** returns.\nNot **self-praising**, so **fruitful**.\n\nOnly the one who **does not dwell** upon it,\nThus does not **abandon** it.\nOnly the one who **does not contend**,\nNone under heaven can **contend with** them.\n\nTheir **conduct** is as **flexible as water**,\nAnd none dare **not submit**.\n\nWhat was called **\"Bend and you are whole\"**—\nIs it not a **hollow phrase**?\nIt is **whole** and **returns**—\nOnly act **appropriately**, and the **effect** will **self-manifest**.\n**Sparse speech** is **natural**.\n\nThe **cautious in speech**,\nNot only **few in blame**,\nBut also **harmonize with the Dao’s natural Way**.\n\n**Gales** do not last the morning,\n**Sudden rains** do not last the day.\nThese two, **injuring things** too severely,\nThus cannot endure long.\n\nWho does this?\n**Heaven and Earth**.\nHeaven and Earth, though **greatest in form**,\nAre **spoiled by violent winds and torrential rains**,\nYet dare not **endure long**.\nHow much more so for **humans**—\nWith **utterances** so **abundant**,\nYet **harming the Dao’s natural qi**?\n\nThus, those who **pursue the Dao**,\n**Sparse in speech**—\nSuch is the **true person**.\n\n**Daoists** align with **Dao**,\n**Virtuous ones** align with **virtue**,\n**Lost ones** align with **loss**.\nEach **gathers their own kind**.\n\nAlign with **Dao**, and **Dao** will **align with you**;\nAlign with **virtue**, and **virtue** will **align with you**;\nAlign with **loss**, and **loss** will **align with you**.\n\n**Kindred** meet—\nAll **find accord**.\n\n**Faith** insufficient,\nThere will be **doubt**.\n**Doubt** **sparse speech** **harmonizing with Dao**,\nYet **seeking** **retribution through many words**,\nThen **regret** and **seek** it—\nEven if you **utter sincere resolve**,\nThose who **pursue the Dao** will still not **trust you**.\n\n**Stilted** cannot **stand**—\n**Stilted heels**,\nCannot **endure long**.\n**Striding** cannot **walk**—\n**Striding wide**, how can you **reach far**?\n\n**Self-revealing** is **not clear**,\n**Self-righteous** is **not illuminated**,\n**Self-praising** is **not fruitful**,\n**Self-proud** is **not long-lasting**.\n\nFrom **stilted** and **striding** arise **self-revealing** and such **conducts**—\nThese are all **empty actions**,\nAnd **transgressing the natural**,\nOne **fault** in the **body**,\nAnd you become **cast out by humanity**—\nHow much more so if **both** are present?\n\nIn **Dao**, it is called **\"excess food, superfluous limbs\"**—\nIts **repulsiveness**,\nLike **leftover food**,\nLike **excess flesh** on the **form**.\n\n**Things** may **abhor** it,\nThus **Daoists** are **unsettled**.\n\nCommon **trivialities**,\nEven **susceptible to objection**,\nYet **Daoists** **do not dwell** upon these.\n\nThere is a **thing** **mixed and complete**,\nBorn before **Heaven and Earth**.\nWhen **Original Qi** **condenses and congeals**,\nNot yet **Heaven and Earth**.\n\n**Silent** and **vast**—\n**Supreme void**, **supreme stillness**.\n**Standing alone**, yet **unchanging**,\nNot **mingling with things**,\nNor **following things’ transformations**.\n\n**Circulating endlessly**, yet **never exhausted**,\n**Fully manifesting** within **all things**,\nAnd **never** at **risk** at any time.\n\nIt can be the **mother of all under heaven**—\n**Capable of nurturing and giving birth**.\n\nI **do not know** its name,\nNo **attainment** to **call** it by.\n**Forcibly** name it **Dao**—\n*Dao* to **express virtue**,\nFor it possesses the **virtue of giving birth to Heaven and Earth**,\nThus **name it Dao** to **express** it.\n\n**Forcibly** name it **Great**—\n*Great* to **summon reality**,\nFor it **embodies nothing**—\nThus **name it Great**.\n\nTo **demonstrate** to **all people** who wish to **cultivate**,\nThere will be **what is called**.\n\n**Great** is **passing**—\nOnce **passed**, it is **no longer in Greatness**.\n**Passing** is **far**—\nAnd **passing** again **loses its place**.\n**Far** is **return**—\n**Pursuing** the **far** is **unattainable**,\nSuddenly **returning** to the **void-heart**.\n\nThus, **Dao is Great**,\n**Heaven is Great**,\n**Earth is Great**,\nAnd the **King** is also **Great**.\nThough the **King** cannot **compare** with the **Three Great**,\nTheir **greatness** is **ranked below**.\n\nWithin the **domain** are the **Four Great**,\nAnd the **King** occupies **one** of them.\n\n**Dao**, having **descended** to the **Three Great**,\nAll **originate from Dao**.\nThe **King**, having **ascended** above the **Three Great**,\nAll **order the King’s laws**.\n\n**Humans follow Earth**—\nEarth’s **virtue** is **stillness and bearing** while **giving birth to things**,\nThose who **follow** it **make it like Earth**,\nThus called **\"Earth-Earth\"** for **Earth’s likeness**.\n\n**Follow Heaven**—\nHeaven’s **virtue** is **broad coverage without partiality**,\nThose who **follow** it **make it like Heaven**,\nThus called **\"Heaven-Heaven\"** for **Heaven’s likeness**.\n\n**Follow Dao**—\nDao’s **nature** is **forgetting merit**,\nThose who **follow** it **make it like Dao**,\nThus called **\"Dao-Dao\"** for **Dao’s likeness**.\n\n**Follow the natural**—\nIf **humans** can **follow** the **Three**,\nAll **become One**,\nThen you can be called **King**,\nAnd you are **one person among ten thousand**.\n\nSpeaking of **Earth, Heaven, Dao**—\nThe **Three**, all possess **natural wondrous principles**,\nThe **King** should **follow** them.\n\n**Natural principles**—\nThis is **covering and bearing**, **generating and completing**, yet **not partial**.\n**Stillness** is the **root of agitation**,\nAll things **generate from roots**—\nBecause **roots are heavy**.\n\n「Thus all ten thousand people are without fail subject to the rule of the **King**,\nFor the **King** embodies **stillness**.\n\nTherefore, the **King**’s conduct never strays from his **wagons and provisions** throughout the day.\nThe **King** who seeks to achieve anything must first prepare his **wagons and provisions**,\nTo guard against the miseries of cold, heat, hunger, and want.\n\nThough there are palaces of splendor and places of leisure,\nHe remains detached and serene.\nDetached and serene—\nThis is the appearance of **transcending and releasing**.\n**Palaces of splendor** are the Spring Platforms,\n**Places of leisure** are where the **burning** (燕) birds dwell,\nThese are all the **abodes of refinement** (治容).\nThose who uphold **stillness** and **substance** can truly **transcend and release**.\n\nYet how can the sovereign of a **ten-thousand chariot** realm treat his own body so lightly before the people?\nAll things, both **humans** and **non-humans**, uphold **stillness** and **substance**—\nHow can the ruler of the realm not value his own body,\nYet make his comings and goings so **light**?\n\n**Lightness** leads to losing his **ministers**,\n**Lightness** in his actions makes governance difficult,\nThus he loses the **hearts of his ministers**.\n**Agitation** leads to losing his **Kingdom**.\nIf his **emotions and nature** are **agitated**,\nAnd he does not **settle himself in stillness**,\nThen he will lose his **Kingdom**.\n\n**Good conduct** leaves no trace,\n**Following Dao** leaves no trace.\n**Good speech** has no flaws or censure,\n**Speaking of Dao** has no censure.\n**Good calculation** does not rely on tools or reckoning—\n**Upholding stillness and purity**, he needs no tools or reckoning.\n**Good closure** requires no locks or bars yet cannot be opened—\n**Closing** the seven orifices and all gates,\nNo **demons** can enter.\n**Good binding** requires no cords or knots yet cannot be undone—\n**Purifying** the five **zang** organs and all **spirits**,\nExternal things cannot tempt him.\n\nThus, the **Sage** is always **good at rescuing people**,\nHence there are none he **abandons**;\nAlways **good at rescuing things**,\nHence there are none he **abandons**.\n**Hidden actions** like those above—\nThe **Dao** permeates even **grass and trees**,\nHow much more so among **humans**?\n\nThis is called **\"Covering Brightness\"**.\n**Inner conduct** yet **no outward display**.\nThus, the **good person** is the **teacher** of the **not-good person**;\nThe **good person** can **give goodness** to others.\nThe **not-good person** is the **material** of the **good person**.\n**Material** means **supplying**.\nThe **not-good person** is what the **good person** can **supply** with.\nIf one does not **honor his teacher**,\nOr **love his material**,\nBoth reach **Dao**,\nAnd then **forget each other**.\n\nThough knowing **great confusion**,\nThis is called **\"Essential Marvel\"**.\n**Forgetting teacher and material**—\nThe common people call it **confusion**,\nBut **Dao** calls it **marvelous**.\n\nKnow **its masculine**,\nYet **guard its feminine**—\nThen you become the **deep valley** of the world.\nThough you possess **masculine and martial** talents,\nIf you **feminine and subdue** them as your **heart**,\nThen all will **gather to you**,\nLike the world’s **deep valleys**.\n\nTo be the **deep valley** of the world—\n**Constant virtue** never departs,\n**Humility’s virtue** never leaves your body,\nThen you are like a **valley** where all **streams** converge.\n\nReturn again to the **Infant Brother**.\n**Harmonious qi** fills the **body**.\n\nKnow **its white**,\nYet **guard its black**—\nThen you become the **model** of the world.\n**Model** means **law**.\n**Concealing white as black**,\nThen all under heaven dare not but **submit**.\n\nTo be the **model** of the world—\n**Constant virtue** never errs,\n**Embrace this virtue of obscurity and use it**,\nAnd your body will always be **without fault**.\nReturn again to **Non-Extremity**.\n\nIts **virtue** is such—\nThus **blessings and longevity** are **unmeasurable**.\n\nKnow **its glory**,\nYet **guard its disgrace**—\nThen you become the **valley** of the world.\nIf you **treat glory as disgrace**,\nThen your **measure** is like a **valley**,\n**Accepting all without distinction**.\n\nTo be the **valley** of the world—\n**Constant virtue** is then **sufficient**,\n**Measure** without exclusion,\n**Virtue** without deficiency,\nReturn again to **Non-Extremity**.\n**Non-Extremity** is the **origin** of all **vessels**,\nWhen **virtue is complete**, it can **return to origin**.\n**Origin** is **Dao**.\n**Non-Extremity** **scattered** becomes **vessels**,\n**Vessels** **circumscribed** by **use**—\n**Dao** **scattered** then all **vessels** are formed.\n\nThe **Sage** **uses** it and becomes **officials and leaders**,\nThe **Sage** **uses Dao**,\nStanding above all **talents**,\n**Guiding and transforming** those who do not **know the bright Dao**.\nThus, **great governance** does not **sever**.\n\n**Holding** the **Great Dao**,\nThus he can **govern and subdue** all **living beings**,\nHe must **guard it with Non-Action**,\nNot **adding punishments or laws**.\n\nIf one intends to **take the world** yet does so,\nHe seeks the **world’s favor**—\nI see this as **inevitable failure**.\n\nIf one **takes with Action**,\nI see this will **inevitably fail**.\n**Inevitable** is a **grammatical particle**.\n\nThe **world** is a **divine vessel**—\nIt cannot be **taken by force**.\n**Divine vessel** means **human**.\n**Humans** **inhabit spirits**,\nThus called **divine vessel**.\n**Human nature** is **evil and chaotic**,\n**Action** **disturbs** people,\nThus it is known that one cannot **take the world by force**.\n\n**Action** leads to **ruin**,\n**Forcing** leads to **people scattering**.\n**Grasping** leads to **losing it**,\nIf one **does not trust** **profound words**,\nAnd **clings stubbornly** to his **original intent**,\nThen he will **inevitably lose** the **imperial realm**.\n\nThus, **things** either **move** or **follow**,\nIf **Action** is **pursued** before,\nIt will **inevitably lead to ruin** and **losing those who follow**.\n\nEither **breathing** or **blowing**,\n**Ren’s virtue** is called **breathing** (陶),\n**Severe punishment** is called **blowing**.\nEither **strong** or **weak**,\nWhen the **people are at ease**, they are **strong**,\nWhen the **people scatter**, they are **weak**.\nEither **supporting** or **overthrowing**,\n**Caressing** them leads to **supporting**,\n**Cruelty** leads to **overthrowing**.\n\nThus the **Sage** **removes excess**,\n**Removes extravagance**,\n**Removes excessiveness**.\nThe **verification** of **Action** is so **excessive**,\nHow can the **ruler of the world** not **remove it**?\n\nWith the **Sage’s governance**,\nHe **approaches** those within it who **remove excess**,\n**Remove extravagance**,\nAnd **excessiveness**.\n\n**Assisting** the **sovereign** with **Dao**,\nNot **assisting** with **arms**.\nThe **ancient** **good advisors**,\n**Calming the people** and **strengthening the realm**,\nThen **Dao** is used, not **arms**.\n\nTheir **affairs** **love to return**.\nThe **victorious general**,\nHis **army’s footsteps** not yet **returned**,\nAlready **reported** by the enemy.\nWhere the **army** **dwells**,\n**Thorns and brambles** **grow**.\n**Obstructing** farming and **weeding**,\nThus **thorns and brambles** **grow**.\nAfter a **great army**,\nThere will **inevitably** be **years of hardship**.\nAfter **warfare and slaughter**,\nThe **killing qi** still **lingers**,\n**Harmony and balance** have not yet **restored**,\nNo **fine grains** will **sprout**.\n\nThus, **goodness’s fruit** is **all that is pursued**,\nAnd one **dares not** to **take by force**.\n**Assisting** the **sovereign** **must align** with **Dao**,\nNot **align** with **arms**.\nIf **inevitable failure**,\nThen **choose** his **good generals**,\nWho **must** be **resolute** yet **not** **pursue victory** for its own sake.\n\n**Resolute** yet **not arrogant**,\n**Resolute** yet **not boastful**,\n**Resolute** yet **not proud**,\n**Resolute** yet **inevitable failure**—\nThis is **resolute** yet **not forcing**.\nIf a **good general** leads **armored soldiers** to **punish evil**,\nHe **must** be **resolute** yet **not arrogant**,\n**Not boastful**,\n**Not proud**—\nWhy?\nFor **resoluteness** comes from **humility**,\nNot **resoluteness** from **forcing**.\n**Forcing** is **contrary to Dao**.\n\n**Things** reach **peak strength** yet **grow old**—\nThis is called **\"Not Dao\"**.\n**Things** reach **peak strength** yet **grow old**,\n**Arms** reach **peak strength** yet **not necessarily** **victory**,\nAll are **contrary to Dao**.\n\n「Not Dao is early failure.\nTo know what is contrary to Dao,\nAnd be able to stop early—this is good.\n\n**Stopping** is **cessation**.\nThe **good general** who loves war\nIs an **omen of misfortune**—*good*, meaning fondness.\nWar is the **instrument of harm**,\nAnd fondness of war is not **virtue**.\n**Things** may be evil,\nThus the **Daoist** does not dwell there.\nAll **things** cherish life and abhor death,\nAnd if a realm loves war,\nEven common **things** will detest it—\nHow much more so the **Daoist scholar**,\nWho would dare to reside in such a realm?\n\nA **gentleman** in **peace** holds the **left** in esteem,\nFor he embodies **仁 (rén)** to nurture others,\nAnd in **peace**, he must occupy the **position of life’s flourishing**.\nIn war, he holds the **right** in esteem.\nThe **commander of war** takes killing as his purpose,\nThus his use must be **aligned with the path of destruction**—\nWar is an **omen of misfortune**,\nNot the **instrument** of a **gentleman**.\nA **gentleman**’s **instrument** is **cultural virtue (文德)**,\nNot **weapons of violence (干戈)**.\nWhen he **must** use it,\nThough not his own **instrument**,\nIt is **not obtained otherwise**.\n\n**Serenity and simplicity** are supreme.\nThe **flavor** of his use is **not** in **victory**,\nFor **victory** is **not** **beautiful**—\nHe values **serenity and simplicity** above all,\nThus **victory** is **not** **beautiful**.\nBut those who find it **beautiful**,\nRejoice in killing—*love*, meaning fondness.\nIf one takes **victory** as **beautiful**,\nThen he is **fond of killing**—\nHe who rejoices in killing\nCannot fulfill his **aspirations** in the world.\nAll detest death—\nWho would willingly **submit** to it?\nThus **auspicious matters** are **esteemed on the left**,\n**Inauspicious matters** on the **right**.\nEach follows its **kind**.\n\nThe **general of the left** dwells on the **left**,\nThough he is the **official of killing**,\nHe lacks the **authority to kill**.\nThe **general of the right** dwells on the **right**,\nSpecializing in **campaigns and conquests**.\n*Speaking* of **funeral rites**,\nHe is placed **near the coffin**.\nKilling many,\nHe **lamented and wept**—\nThe **gentleman** as **general** would say:\n*\"Truly, I lack **virtue**,\nThe people have **no guilt**—\nIn one day, I slaughter and wound them,\nNearly driving them to **death**.\"*\nThus, **speaking of war**,\nHis **tears followed**—\nThe **victory** of war was **treated as funeral rites**.\nPlacing him in that position,\nHe need not **wear its garments**,\nBut **first**, to **align with its killing qi**,\nAnd **second**, to **restrain the heart** of the **warlord**.\n\n**Dao** is **always nameless**—\nNow I name it **Dao**,\nThis is **forcing a name**.\nThough **primordial simplicity (朴)** is small,\nIt is **such that one cannot see it**.\nThe world **dares not** to **submit** to it.\nHolding **Dao** within,\nHe is still **worthy as a teacher** to the **sage-king**—\nHow much more so would he **dare to submit** to **Dao** as a **servant**?\n\nIf **marquis-kings (侯王)** could **guard** it,\nThe world would **voluntarily submit**.\n*Submit*, meaning **to obey**—\nIf one **guards Dao** without forgetting,\nThen none would **fail to submit** from afar.\n**Heaven and Earth** unite,\nAnd **descend sweet dew (甘露)**—\nWhen **Heaven and Earth** exchange **harmony (泰)**,\nThey can **descend sweet dew**,\nThus **marquis-kings** who **guard Dao** are **signified**—\nNo one **commands** them,\nYet all **become equal**.\n\nThe **Way of the Sage** has **no bias**,\nThus his **virtue and grace** are **evenly bestowed**—\nWhy **await orders**?\nAt the **beginning of governance**, names are **established**,\nYet **Dao** reaches this point—\nOnly then can it **subdue and serve** the **named**.\nThe **named** are the **spirits of mountains and rivers**,\nAnd the **scholars of forests and springs**.\nNames are **already established**.\nThus, when **named spirits** are **enshrined**,\nThey **must submit** to **funeral rites**,\nAnd **scholars of forests and springs**,\nThough **exhausted from their labors**,\nWill **all emerge** to **pay respects**.\n\nHe who **knows how to stop** will **not** be **endangered**—\n*Endangered*, meaning **in peril**.\nThe **named** rely on the **Daoist ruler**,\nAnd **find peace** in **auspicious lands**—\nHow much more so the **common folk**?\n\n**Dao** in the world\nIs like **streams and valleys** to the **great rivers and seas**.\nThe **Daoist ruler** in the **world**,\nWhen **ruler and subject align with Dao**,\n**Superior grace flows downward**,\n**Inferior emotions reach upward**,\nLike **streams and valleys** flowing into the **great rivers and seas**.\n\nHe who **knows others** is **wise**—\nThe **wise** are **not confused**,\nThus he **knows others**.\nHe who **knows himself** is **clear**—\nThe **clear** see **before things manifest**,\nThus he **does not tread upon what is contrary to Dao**.\n\nHe who **overcomes others** has **strength**—\nOthers **overcome others** by **power or might**,\nBut he who **overcomes himself** is **powerful**.\nHe who can **cultivate virtue** to **subdue others**\nIs **far stronger** than those with mere **strength**.\n\nHe who **knows contentment** is **rich**—\nIf one is **content with a single gourd**,\nThen he is **rich beyond all realms**.\nHe who **pursues strength** has **aspiration**—\nTo **begin and complete** matters **unwaveringly**\nIs to have **aspiration and integrity**.\nHe who **does not lose his place** endures **long**—\nYet **without constancy**,\nHe cannot **long endure his Dao**.\n\nHe who **dies yet does not perish** is **long-lived**—\nIf a man **practices Dao** to **benefit the world**,\nThe **laws and institutions** he **leaves behind**\nEmerge from **divine insight and wisdom**,\nOnce **established**, they **last eternally**—\nThis is **his body decaying** yet **his spirit enduring**,\nThus he is **long-lived**.\n\nThe **Great Dao** is **vast and boundless**—\nIt is **not confined to one side**,\nYet I say it is **left or right**—\nThis is **briefly illustrating two extremes**,\nTo **make clear** the **completeness of all things**.\nAll **things depend on it** to **flourish**,\nYet it **does not refuse**—\nWhen **nurturing all things** is complete,\nIt **does not claim ownership**.\nIt **loves and nourishes** all **things** yet **does not rule** them.\nTo **rule** would be **not forgetting its deeds**.\n\n**Always without desire**,\nIt can be **named small**—\nThe **desireless** of the world\nAre **innocent children**.\nBut **Dao** in **things** has **no desire**,\nIs it **as small as innocent children**?\nAll **things return** to it yet it **does not rule**—\nIs it **as great as this**,\nYet **unconcerned with things**?\n\nThus, the **sage** never **claims greatness**—\nThe **sage** follows **Dao**,\nAnd **follows the small**,\nNot **following the great**,\nFor fear of **losing humility**.\nThus he **can achieve the greatest**.\nWithout the **heart to claim greatness**,\nHis **deeds become vast and enduring**.\nHolding the **great image (大象)**—\nThe world **comes toward** it—\n*The great image*, meaning **Dao**.\nNo **thing** exists that **does not**,\nThrough **Dao**, take **form and substance**—\nIf he **holds this Dao** to **face the world**,\nThe people **will not fail to come toward** it.\n\n**Coming toward** yet **doing no harm**,\n**Peace and ease prevail**.\nOnce they **have come toward** it,\nThey **must be settled**—\nNot in **order and tranquility** alone,\nBut in **harmonious ease and repose**—\n**Joy and bait**,\nFor **passing travelers** to **rest**.\n\n**Music is melody.**\n**Bait is sustenance.**\nWhat man desires—music and food—\nWho, passing by, would not pause to rest?\n**Dao**, when spoken, is bland, without taste.\nYet travelers linger because of sights to see,\nAnd food to fill their bellies.\nIf this **great image (Dao)** were to emerge from the mouth,\nTo teach the people—bland, without savor—\nHow could one make them yearn for it?\n\nMoreover, human nature is prone to excess,\nYet craves **non-action**.\n**Dao** itself is **non-action**—\nThus men desire it.\nTo gaze upon it is insufficient to perceive its form,\nTo listen is insufficient to hear its sound,\nYet to employ it is inexhaustible.\n*Inexhaustible*—meaning complete.\nThough sight and hearing fail to grasp its shape and voice,\nIf one uses it, its power is boundless.\n**To contract it**, one must first expand it;\n**To weaken it**, one must first strengthen it;\n**To discard it**, one must first establish it;\n**To take it away**, one must first bestow it.\nThis is called **subtle clarity**.\n\nThese four principles—\nAt their nascent stage, may be called **subtle**,\nYet they can solidify the source\nAnd sever the sprouts before they rise.\n\n**Softness overcomes hardness**—\nFor what begins as frail and weak\nEventually flourishes into strength and vigor.\nIf one seeks to remove it in its tender state,\nVictory is assured over its hardened form.\n\n**Fish cannot be caught from the depths**—\nIf the fish slips from the hand and plunges into the deep,\nIt cannot be controlled.\n**A nation’s sharpest tools**\nShould not be displayed to the people.\n*Sharp tools*—meaning **strategic schemes**.\nWhen matters are in their embryonic stage,\nThey can be guided—\nNot allowed to reach full strength.\nThis is the true principle for governing self and state,\nAnd must never be revealed to the unworthy.\nIf such schemes fall into the hands of the unprincipled,\nWhat difference is there from the fish slipping into the deep?\n\n**Dao** acts without action,\nYet nothing remains undone.\nIt acts without intention—\nThus it accomplishes all things.\n\nIf lords and kings could uphold it,\nAll things would transform of their own accord.\nIf **non-action** is not abandoned,\nThen nothing remains untransformed.\nWhen transformation stirs,\nI shall govern it with the **Uncarved Block of the Nameless**.\n*The Uncarved Block of the Nameless*—\nThe foundation of **non-action**.\n**Non-action** leaves no trace—\nWhat name could it bear?\nIf the ruler holds this to govern the people,\nWho would dare move recklessly?\nThe **Uncarved Block of the Nameless** also\nShall not desire.\nWhen the mind of guarding **Dao** is forgotten,\nOne aligns with the original simplicity of nature.\n**Non-desire**, through stillness,\nAnd the world will self-correct.\nHe who seeks stillness with intent\nWill never attain it.\nNow, set free into natural ease,\nWith nothing in the breast—\nThen ruler and subject, high and low,\nEach return to their true nature.\n\n*End of New Commentary on the Dao De Jing, Volume Two*\n*Beginning of New Commentary on the Dao De Jing, Volume Three*\n\n「Li Yue’s Annotation: *Dao De Jing*, Upper Section\n\n**Chapter Forty-One:**\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the Highest **Dao/Way** does not cling to **virtue/power**,\nYet men do not see its trace—\nThen they call it *not* **virtue/power**.\n\nThus, it is indeed **virtue/power**:\nThings do not alter their **Uncarved Block**—\nOnly then does one know it as **virtue/power**.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the Lowest **Dao/Way** does not abandon **virtue/power**,\nAdmiring the beauty of former kings,\nReverently guarding it without decline.\nThus, it is *not* **virtue/power**.\n\nWhen the nature of things slightly shifts,\nOne knows it as *not* **virtue/power**.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the Highest **Dao/Way** acts without action yet nothing is left undone,\nDoes without doing yet achieves.\nThe **virtue/power** of the Lowest **Dao/Way** acts with doing yet leaves nothing undone,\nDoes with doing yet achieves.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the Highest Benevolence\nBegins by transforming **Dao/Way** into benevolence,\nYet nothing is left undone—\nThough it acts, its mind remains undisturbed.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the Highest Righteousness\nBegins by transforming **Dao/Way** into righteousness,\nYet leaves nothing undone—\nFocusing solely on judgment and restraint.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the Highest Propriety\nBegins by transforming **Dao/Way** into propriety,\nYet none respond—\nThen they roll up their sleeves and force it upon them.\nGifts and replies are misplaced,\nThus arises this anger.\nHence, **virtue/power** is lost before **Dao/Way** is lost—\nThe Highest **Dao/Way** aligns with **Dao/Way**, hence the saying *loses **Dao/Way***.\nThe **virtue/power** of the Lowest **Dao/Way** follows next,\nThis is why there is **virtue/power**, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety.\nHaving lost the Highest **virtue/power**,\nThe Lowest **virtue/power** takes its place.\n\n**Virtue/power** is lost before benevolence—\nThe Lowest **virtue/power** has its flaws,\nThus teachings of benevolence arise.\nBenevolence is lost before righteousness—\nTeachings of benevolence decline,\nThus righteousness prevails.\nRighteousness is lost before propriety—\nRight and wrong, fitting and improper,\nAlready fading in time,\nBow and kneel, jade and silk,\nFlourish in the world.\nFor propriety is but the thinnest veneer of loyalty and trust,\nAnd the beginning of chaos.\nChaos is when rulers are not rulers,\nSubjects are not subjects,\nFathers are not fathers,\nSons are not sons.\nLoyalty and trust are **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**.\nIf propriety is compared to **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,\nIt is indeed decayed and thin.\nYet to save from chaos,\nWhere else would one turn but propriety?\nThose who foresaw this knew that propriety would please the eyes of the people—\nThis is called the *flower of **Dao/Way***.\nIn ancient times, *flower* was written; now *ornament* is used instead.\nYet it is the beginning of foolishness.\nIf it is suitable for the foolish,\nIt is the first sign of extravagance.\nThus, a true **man of **Dao/Way****—\nA **man of **Dao/Way**** is one of strong character.\nThe strong character of a **man of **Dao/Way****\nMust be square and upright, not yielding to superficial trends,\nHence the *Changyan* says:\n*A true **man of **Dao/Way****, must practice **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,\nNot indulge in superficial propriety.*\nDwelling in its depth, not in its shallowness,\nHe must commit himself to **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,\nNot place himself in decayed thinness.\nResiding in substance, not in ornament—\nSubstance like the fruit of grass and trees,\nFilling the stomach of men,\nThus it is dwelt upon.\nOrnament like the flowers of grass and trees,\nMerely pleasing to the eye,\nThus it is not dwelt upon.\nHence, he discards that and takes this—\nDiscarding ornament, taking substance.\nThe *ancient ones who attained **Oneness*** are found in the lower text.\n\nHeaven attains **Oneness** and finds clarity,\nEarth attains **Oneness** and finds tranquility,\nThe valleys attain **Oneness** and fill,\nThe **spirit** attains **Oneness** and becomes luminous,\nAll things attain **Oneness** and live,\nNoble kings attain **Oneness** to rule the world with rectitude.\nFrom Heaven and Earth descending to noble kings,\nWhat enables them to be clear and tranquil,\nIs attaining **Oneness** from **Dao/Way**,\nHence the noble kings rectify themselves to rectify the people,\nThus the world is ruled with rectitude.\n*Rectitude* means *correctness*.\nTheir attainment is as follows:\nHaving known **Dao/Way**,\nTheir attainment is thus—\nHow could they lose it?\n\nHeaven without clarity would fear collapse,\nEarth without tranquility would fear upheaval,\nThe valleys without fullness would fear exhaustion,\nThe **spirit** without luminosity would fear cessation,\nAll things without life would fear annihilation,\nNoble kings without nobility would fear decline.\n*Cessation* means *overturned*.\nIf one attains it yet does not guard it,\nThus arise these calamities.\n\nHence, nobility takes humility as its foundation,\nKings are noble, the people are humble,\nKings take the people as their foundation,\nThus there are people, there are kings.\nHighness takes lowliness as its base.\nA mountain nine *zhang* high,\nA single basketful as its base—\nIf the base is not firm,\nThe mountain will topple.\nTo preserve nobility,\nNot resting securely upon the people,\nThen the people scatter and the kings decline.\nThus, noble kings call themselves *lonely, childless, without grain*—\nIs this not taking humility as their foundation?\nNo, it is not.\n*Lonely* means *child without father*,\n*Childless* means *woman without husband*,\n*Without grain* means *life without sustenance*.\nThese three are what men detest,\nYet noble kings claim them—\nIs this not taking humility as their foundation?\nNo, it is not—\nIt is saying that correctness is taking humility as the foundation.\n\nHence, when attaining the **Dao/Way** of a chariot,\nOne seeks the **Dao/Way** of a chariot—\nOnly the wheels and axles and all the materials are obtained.\nThen, when attaining the **Dao/Way** of a king,\nOne seeks the **Dao/Way** of a king—\nOnly the ministers and the common people are obtained.\nIf one scatters the materials,\nThere will be no day of making a chariot;\nIf one does not rest securely upon the people,\nHow could there be a time for ruling as a king?\n\nDo not desire to be smooth and polished like jade,\nNor rough and unrefined like stone.\n*Smooth and polished* is the appearance of nobility,\n*Rough and unrefined* is the appearance of humility.\nThough jade is noble,\nIt grows from stone;\nThough kings are exalted,\nThey depend upon the people.\nThus, not desiring to be like jade,\nDesiring to be like stone,\nIs to cherish the foundation.\n*Reversion* is the movement of **Dao/Way**,\n**Dao/Way**’s essence is stillness—\nMovement is reversion,\nThe reason for reversion is the rigid nature of things,\nHence setting forth the rigid to meet it,\nAlso hoping to reverse its stillness.\n\nSoftness is the application of **Dao/Way**.\nThe soft and weak are the constant use of **Dao/Way**.\nAll things know this,\nYet it is made clear again—\nFor fear that, due to the meaning of *setting forth the rigid*,\nOne would say that the application of **Dao/Way** is naturally so.\n\nAll things under Heaven are born from *having*,\nAll things are born from the forms of Heaven and Earth.\n*Having* is born from *non-having*.\nThat is, the forms of Heaven and Earth are born from **Dao/Way**.\n**Dao/Way** is *non-having*.\n\nThe Superior **man of **Dao/Way**** hears **Dao/Way**,\nDiligently practices it;\nHearing it and understanding,\nHe diligently practices and returns to the foundation.\n\nThe Middle **man of **Dao/Way**** hears **Dao/Way**,\nAs if it exists, as if it does not;\nHearing it and doubting,\nIt is still teachable—\nTo make him know **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe Inferior **man of **Dao/Way**** hears **Dao/Way**,\nAnd laughs greatly—\nHearing it and being confused,\nThus he laughs greatly,\nThen one cannot make him white as snow.»\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is not to be taken lightly—\nFor when it enters the ears of the Inferior **man of Dao/Way** as mere sound,\nIt is not worthy of esteem.\n\nLet me establish this teaching:\n*\"Establish\"* means to clarify.\nClarify the doubts of the Middle and Inferior **men of Dao/Way**,\nWhy they laugh in derision.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is bright yet hidden in practice,\nIlluminated in deed yet concealed in application.\nAdvancing the **Dao/Way** seems like retreat—\nWithin, diligent; without, appearing idle.\nMaking the **Dao/Way** plain seems like disorder—\nLike uneven silk, rough to the touch.\nTreading the level ground as if on perilous heights.\n**Virtue/power** most exalted resembles a valley—\nWithout contrivance, yet responsive in all things.\nGreat whiteness seems like shame—\nPure in nature, yet stained in appearance.\nAmple **virtue/power** appears insufficient—\nThe **Dao/Way** does not manifest in form.\nEstablished **virtue/power** seems like theft—\nTalent concealed, not displayed.\nTrue substance seems corrupted—\nThe most absolute becomes like excess.\nThe greatest square has no corners—\nNo edges or valleys are visible.\nGreat vessels take long to form—\nNot sought daily and obtained.\nGreat music is without sound—\n*\"Hesitant\"* means *nonexistent*.\nWithout sound, yet joyous.\nGreat images are formless—\nThe form of the formless.\n\nFrom *\"Establish this teaching\"* onward,\nAll speak of the **Dao/Way** hidden in the nameless.\nThus, the Superior **man of Dao/Way** penetrates and practices with diligence,\nThe Middle **man of Dao/Way** doubts and hesitates,\nThe Inferior **man of Dao/Way** is confused and laughs—\nNow you know the reason.\n\nOnly the **Dao/Way** is good at lending and completing.\nThe **Dao/Way** does not discriminate among the three **men of Dao/Way**,\nBut uniformly lends its harmonizing *qi*—\nAll things grow and are completed.\nYet those who practice diligently alone return to harmony with the **Dao/Way**,\nWhile those who doubt and laugh both perish in the original *qi*.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** generates *Oneness*—\nThat is, it responds to stimuli and generates *One qi*.\n*One* generates *Two*—\n*One* first generates *yin qi*,\n*Two* first generates *yang qi*.\n*Two* generates *Three*—\n*Three* is when *yin* and *yang* interact and generate harmonizing *qi*.\n*Three* generates all things—\nHarmonizing *qi* gathers and gives birth to all things.\nAll things carry *yin* externally and embrace *yang* internally,\nTheir clashing *qi* harmonizes.\nGenerally, the outer skin and texture are called *\"carrying yin.\"*\nSkin and texture are the work of *yin qi*.\nThe marrow and bones, filled within, are called *\"embracing yang.\"*\nBone structure is the work of *yang qi*.\nThe **Dao/Way**’s *qi* is soft and weak,\nPenetrating and harmonizing between them.\n\nWhat people detest are the *Three Loneliness*—\nThe solitary, the widowed, the childless—\nYet kings and nobles take them as titles.\nThe kings and nobles’ harmonizing *qi* is soft and weak,\nThe root of all things,\nThus they can use what is unlucky as their title,\nAnd so become rulers of the world.\nThus, some things are diminished yet benefit—\nCalling it unlucky is truly self-diminishment,\nFor how could anything not submit?\nOr benefit yet be diminished—\nThose who rely on their noble status\nAre themselves the benefactors,\nYet the people’s hearts turn away—\nWhat else but loss could it be?\n\nWhat people teach is also my teaching.\nIf one desires to establish teaching for others,\nThey must also teach with the principle of softness and weakness,\nThen those who embrace it will all return to the city of nature and life.\n\nThe strong and violent do not meet a good end.\nWhen a ruler is strong and tyrannical,\nHis ministers’ loyalty wanes, and ruin is imminent.\nWhen a person is strong and violent,\nThey are overthrown by the many—\nTheir downfall is inevitable.\nI will make this my teaching’s foundation.\n*\"Foundation\"* means what comes first.\nI make the principle of softness and weakness\nThe first teaching for the people.\n\nThe most soft under Heaven\nOvercomes the most hard under Heaven.\nFor harmonizing *qi* is the most soft thing under Heaven.\nIf one rides it,\nIt transforms into the most hard thing under Heaven.\nThere is nothing that enters the unbroken—\nIf one wishes to restore harmonizing *qi* to its softness,\nSimply abandon the intent to ride it,\nClarify the mind that harmonizing *qi* naturally enters the unbroken,\nAnd it transforms into the most soft thing.\n\nThus I know the benefits of *wuwei*.\nLaozi said:\n*\"I see those who ride *wuwei*—\nThey can make harmonizing *qi* dwell eternally in the heart,\nSoft and weak, yet long-lived—\nThus I know *wuwei* benefits people.\"*\n\nThe teaching of silence,\nThe benefits of *wuwei*—\nFew under Heaven can attain them.\nTo not speak to others,\nTo practice *wuwei* oneself—\nFew under Heaven can do this.\n\nWhich is closer: name or body?\nName can be discarded, but body cannot—\nThen which is more distant?\nWhich is more abundant: body or wealth?\nWealth lost can be sought, but life lost cannot be regained—\nThen which is scarcer?\nWhich is more harmful: gain or loss?\nGain leads to losing the body,\nLoss preserves the true self—\nThen which is truly advantageous?\n\nThus excessive love brings great expenditure—\nDesire beyond measure means great loss.\nHoarding leads to great ruin.\nAccumulating without dispersing,\nNineteen out of twenty will die.\nKnowing sufficiency brings no disgrace—\nSufficiency in the heart brings constant honor.\nKnowing when to stop brings no peril—\nStopping at one’s measure brings constant peace.\nThis is how one endures long.\n\nGreat completion resembles deficiency—\nThose with full **virtue/power** appear lacking.\nTheir use is unexhausted.\nTheir response to things is boundless.\n\nGreat fullness resembles emptiness—\nThose internally real appear externally void.\nTheir use is inexhaustible.\nEven in aiding the multitude, they are never depleted.\n\nGreat straightness resembles bending—\nThey endure filth without complaint.\nGreat skill resembles clumsiness—\nThey do not boast of their abilities.\nGreat eloquence resembles stammering—\nSeeming unable to speak.\n\nThe restless overcomes the cold—\nThings at their extreme reverse—\nThus at the summer solstice, *yin* begins to arise within it.\nThe tranquil overcomes the heat—\nMisfortune at its peak becomes fortune—\nThus at the winter solstice, *yang* begins to arise within it.\n\nCalmness and stillness are the norm for the world.\n*\"Norm\"* means the balance between restlessness and tranquility—\nThus the second and eighth months.\nHence, from *\"Great completion\"* onward to *\"Great eloquence,\"*\nAll conform to the balance between restlessness and tranquility,\nAttaining the world’s norm.\n\nWhen the world follows the **Dao/Way**,\nWarhorses are driven back to manure fields.\nA **Dao/Way**-governed ruler succeeds a mediocre one,\nAnd must rectify chaos and restore order,\nAbandoning arms and cultivating culture—\nThus the warhorses formerly used in conquest\nAre now unused and returned to their homes\nTo till the fields.\n\nWhen the world lacks the **Dao/Way**,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\nA ruler without the **Dao/Way** follows a peaceful era,\nRelying on abundant treasuries,\nAnd grows fond of warfare,\nSeizing others’ lands—\nThus soldiers never dismount,\nEver stationed at the borders.\n\n「Guilt is none greater than craving what is not right,\nWithin the pursuit of things, there are yet its limits.\nMisfortune is none greater than not knowing contentment—\nWhat lies before one’s eyes, one must not abandon.\nBlame is none more severe than desiring to obtain.\nWhether seen or unseen, all must be sought,\nThen nothing in the world remains untaken—\nThese are the deeds of rulers without the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThus, the contentment of *knowing contentment*,\nKnowing to stop at contentment,\nThen earthen steps and thatched roofs\nAre not yet deemed insufficient—\nEver content, one does not overstep one’s portion.\nTo cherish peace among the people,\nThis is the ruler with the **Dao/Way**.\n\nNot stepping outside one’s door, yet knowing the world—\nBy measuring it with oneself, the world may be understood.\nNot peering through the window, yet seeing the **Dao/Way**—\nTo act in accordance with Heaven, one need not peer through windows.\nThe farther one ventures, the less one knows.\nThe people’s peace lies in the absence of strife,\nYet one contrives strife to bring them peace—\nThen strife grows ever more distant,\nAnd the people’s peace ever more scarce.\n\nHence, the sage acts without knowing,\nKnowing that the people’s peace rests in their own tranquility—\nIf there is no strife, the people are at peace,\nNo need to act upon the world.\n\nThe sage does not see yet names,\nGuarding the **Dao/Way** in office—\nThen the grand steps of governance naturally level,\nWhy await peering through windows to discern clarity?\n\nThe sage does not act yet accomplishes.\nTo perfect this supreme principle,\nOne must do nothing.\nHad one acted otherwise,\nThis result would never have come to pass.\n\nTo study is to grow daily,\nBut those who study grow ever more aware.\nTo cultivate the **Dao/Way** is to diminish daily.\nThose who cultivate the **Dao/Way** diminish their actions day by day.\nDiminish again and again—\nOne diminishment is yet shallow,\nTwo diminishments, then deep.\nUntil one reaches *non-action*.\nDiminish until there is no diminishment,\nThen one wanders in the *Huan Zhong* [1].\n\nWithout action yet without failing to act—\nTo complete great deeds without taking credit is *non-action*.\nTo give rise to all things is without failing to act.\nTo take the world, one must first ensure its peace—\nPeace means *non-action* does not go against the people’s will,\nNor does it take what benefits oneself alone.\nIf one takes what benefits oneself alone, it troubles the people,\nAnd when the people are troubled, they scatter and disperse—\nHow then can one take the world?\n\nThe sage has no fixed heart,\nLike a hollow boat drifting freely upon the waters.\nHe takes the hearts of the people as his own.\nWhat the people delight in, the sage brings to fruition,\nNot contradicting their nature.\nEven what is not good, the sage transforms into good,\nThrough the power of virtue—\nHe never forces others to submit to his own will.\n\nThe trustworthy, I trust them,\nNot thwarting their resolve.\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust them,\nThrough the power of virtue.\nThe sage extends sincerity to the world,\nAnd the people naturally transform into trustworthiness—\nNot by decree, but by their own accord.\n\nThe sage dwells in the world,\nEver mindful—\nThe sage, dwelling in the world,\nEver bears in mind the burdens of the people,\nLest any single thing bring them distress.\nHe blends his heart with the people’s desires.\nThe people all focus their ears and eyes,\nAll straining their ears and eyes,\nTo observe and listen whether the sage follows their desires.\nThe sage treats them as infants—\nIn thought and deed, he nurtures them as tender children,\nNever bearing to disturb them with strife.\n\nLife and death arise from the heart’s deceit—\nDeceit in the heart gives rise to life,\nWhile truth brings death.\nThose who cling to life number thirteen,\nThose who cling to death number thirteen.\nWithin, the five **zang** organs [2],\nWithout, the eight **fu** organs [3],\nEyes, ears, nose, mouth, hands, feet, and the three **lù** afflictions [4]—\nTogether, they lead all people to their deaths.\n\nThe eight **fu** organs race outward,\nThe five **zang** organs receive inward,\nBoth conspire to drag people to their deaths.\nIf one ensures peace—\nEach cleanses its own domain,\nThen one brings people to full life.\n\nAgain it is said:\nThe five **zang** organs, five **xíng** forms [5], and three **dàn** fields [6] make thirteen.\nThe head and the four limbs are the five **xíng** forms.\nThe three **dàn** fields, as the *Huángtíng Jīng* [7] states:\nThe upper **dàn** field is the brain,\nThe middle **dàn** field lies between the heart and spleen,\nThe lower **dàn** field is the **qì** sea within the kidneys.\nThe thirteen paths that lead to life or death—\nThose who seek life, ever restless,\nAll fall into the path of death,\nAlso through the thirteen that deceive them.»\n\n---\n[1] *Huan Zhong* (环中) – The \"circular center\" or \"middle void,\" a Daoist concept of balance and harmony beyond extremes.\n[2] *Zang* (五藏) – The five solid organs: heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys.\n[3] *Fu* (八使) – The eight hollow organs: gallbladder, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, bladder, triple burner, lungs (shared with *zang*), and heart (shared with *zang*).\n[4] *Lù* (三漏) – The \"three leaks\" or defilements: desire, aversion, and delusion.\n[5] *Xíng* (五形) – The five physical forms: head, arms, legs, and torso.\n[6] *Dàn* (三田) – The \"three fields\" or energy centers in Daoist physiology.\n[7] *Huángtíng Jīng* (黄庭经) – A Daoist alchemical text, \"Scripture of the Yellow Court.\"\n\nWhy is this so?\nAsking the cause of falling into the realm of death.\nIt is because of the excess of life’s nourishment.\nThe reply: It is due to overindulgence in worldly things,\nto overfeeding and overindulgence—\nthus the thirteen [deceivers] find opportunity to kill.\n\nIt is said that those who excel in preserving life—\n*preserving* meaning *nourishing*—\nthose who excel in nourishing life\nrestrain the thirteen within the realm of purity and stillness,\nand abandon this body in the place of formlessness.\n\nWhen walking on land, one does not encounter rhinoceros or tigers—\nrhinoceros and tigers are fierce beasts,\ncapable of harming with claw and horn,\nyet without the intent to harm others,\none avoids such encounters.\n\nEntering battlefields, one is not struck by weapons or armor—\nweapons can maim, armor can defend,\nyet without the will to fight,\none does not need to bear such implements.\n\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,\nthe tiger no place to strike with its claw,\nthe blade no place to find its edge.\nIf one’s heart is fixed on harming others,\neven the smallest insect—\na wasp or hornet—\ncannot fail to sting,\nmuch less tigers and rhinoceros!\n\nIf one harbors no intent to harm,\neven when confronted by fierce beasts or sharp weapons,\nhow could they harm you?\n\nIt is further said:\nRhinoceros, tigers, weapons, and armor\nare likened to the evils within the body—\nto say that in purity and non-action,\ncalamity has no cause to enter,\nand sickness no means to arise.\n\nWhy is this so?\nAsking the reason for avoiding death.\n\nThe place where death cannot enter is because of its non-existence.\n\nThe thirteen cohorts are repelled by purity and non-action,\npreventing the Five Evils and Three Corpses from entering the heart.\nThus, there is no place for death to take root.\n\nIf one loses purity even by a hair’s breadth,\nthe Five Evils and Three Corpses seize the opportunity to advance,\nand their horns, claws, and blades find purchase.\n\nThe Way gives birth to it—\nthe initial loan of *qi*.\nVirtue nurtures it—\nthe gradual containment and sustenance.\nThings shape it—\nthe substance and form take full form.\nCircumstance completes it—\nthe four seasons cycle, and things transform accordingly.\nThus, all things do not fail to revere the Way and honor virtue.\n\nEven the most foolish creature knows not to dishonor its parents and fails to revere them.\nThe Way’s exaltation, virtue’s nobility—\nnone bestow them, yet they arise naturally.\n\nWhat mortals revere and honor are those who receive imperial mandate.\nBut the Way and virtue require no such conferral;\nthey possess the inherent function of generation,\nand thus are revered and honored by all things.\n\nTherefore, the Way gives birth, nurtures, lengthens, and matures it,\ncompletes and ripens it, nourishes and shelters it.\nWith such power, it needs no titles or commands.\n\nIt gives birth yet does not possess—\npossession would exhaust its benevolence.\nIt acts yet does not rely—\nreliance would claim its merit.\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\nIt may be called Hidden Benevolence.\n\nThe world has a beginning—\nthe beginning is the root,\nthe source from which all things derive their birth.\nIt is the Mother of the world.\nThe Mother is nourishment,\nthe means by which all things achieve completion.\nHaving known the Mother, one knows the child;\nknowing the Way as Mother, the child is clearly the things.\nHaving known the child, one returns to guard the Mother—\nknowing the child arises from birth,\none knows to guard the Mother to preserve the child.\nThus, one avoids peril to the end of life.\nThe Way upholds it—\nwhat danger could there be?\n\nSeal the *yue* orifice;\nclose the eyes to idle speech.\nShut the gate;\nseal the mouth that speaks much.\nThus, one lives a life without toil,\nand the form rests while the spirit reigns supreme.\n\nOpen the *yue* orifice, aid its affairs—\nthe people’s desires are already excessive;\nwith the Way to guard the gaps, one still fears their excess—\nhow much more so if one aids and indulges them?\nThus, one lives a life without salvation.\nWhen calamity has already taken form,\nit cannot be rectified or rescued.\n\nSeeing the small is clarity—\nwhen form is shaped, enlightenment follows.\nGuarding softness is strength—\nthe accumulation of weakness leads to this.\nUsing its radiance, one returns to its clarity.\nObserving the law of guarding the Mother to preserve the child,\none attains the law and collects vision to guard the center.\nSeeing the small, guarding the soft—\nthis is the law.\nWithout inviting bodily harm,\none avoids self-inflicted calamity.\nThis is called *xi chang*—\nthe hidden path to eternal life.\n\nIf I, a solitary and upright man, were to act in the Great Way,\nsolitary and unyielding—\nif I were to see the division of the world,\nI would make the straight path prevail throughout the world.\nOnly the upright dare fear—\nonly the solitary uphold rectitude—\nhow could they fear the multitude of evils?\n\nThe Great Way is most level,\nthe genuine path for rulers and subjects alike.\nYet people prefer shortcuts.\nIn their time, they favor crooked ways,\nand I, though light in power, cannot restrain them.\n\nThe court is grandly adorned—\nexcessive ornamentation.\nThe fields lie fallow—\nseizing the people’s time.\nThe granaries are empty—\nthe people lack food.\nFine silks and embroideries—\nthe ruler’s wealth is abundant.\nWearing sharp swords—\na fondness for martial display.\nSilent in feasting—\nsquandering precious delicacies.\nAbundant wealth—\nobtained through greedy accumulation.\nThis is called *thieving glory*—\nunrighteous gain—\nwhat is it if not theft?\nYet they show no shame,\nonly more boastfulness.\nHow can this be the Way?\n\nAh, indeed!\nThievery is already not the Way—\nhow much more so when they further pride themselves?\nTruly such people are worthy of lamentation.\n\nThose who build well cannot be toppled—\nthose who build a nation or establish themselves must do so with virtue.\nWith virtue, one’s person is secure and the nation unshaken.\n\nThose who embrace well cannot be lost—\n*lost* means failure.\nThe builder of a nation embraces the people,\nthe establisher of oneself embraces the spirit.\nIf both are done with virtue,\nthere will be no failure or loss.\n\nTheir descendants will sacrifice at the *qi* tree without ceasing.\nThose who build a nation and embrace the people with virtue\nwill have thriving descendants,\nsacrificing at the *qi* tree without interruption.\n\nCultivate it in the person—\nits virtue becomes genuine;\ncultivate virtue in the person,\nand all falseness is exhausted.\n\nCultivate it in the family—\nits virtue becomes abundant;\ncultivate virtue in the family,\nand blessings flow to future generations.\n\nCultivate it in the village—\nits virtue becomes enduring;\ncultivate virtue in the village,\nand its influence grows ever wider.\n\nCultivate it in the nation—\nits virtue becomes plentiful;\ncultivate virtue in the nation,\nand ruler and people flourish.\n\nCultivate it in the world—\nits virtue becomes universal.\nCultivate virtue throughout the world,\nand even common households may be ennobled,\nwith transformation reaching distant lands—\nthus, they climb mountains and cross seas to pay homage.\n\nTherefore, observe the person to understand the person,\nobserve the family to understand the family,\nobserve the village to understand the village,\nobserve the nation to understand the nation,\nobserve the world to understand the world.\nBut by comparing these observations,\nthe rise and fall become visible.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nFrom these matters—\nthis is how one knows.\n\nThe depth of virtue is like that of an infant.\n\nThose who harbor profound virtue,\ntheir nature and form are both like an infant.\nThe infant, at its birth,\nhas a red hue—hence the name.\n\nVenomous creatures do not sting,\nvenomous creatures being bees and wasps,\nstriking with their tail-tips to inflict venom—this is called \"sting.\"\nFierce beasts do not clutch,\nfierce beasts being tigers and leopards,\nstriking with their claws to seize—this is called \"clutch.\"\n**Playn** birds do not strike.\n\nMen of virtue,\nabandon all attachments and preserve their **spirit** (*shén*),\nthus naturally evading the three dangers above.\nIt is further said:\nThe three dangers are like the **acquisitive and perverse poisons** (*tān yé dú hài*) within the body—\nif one’s virtue is as pure as an infant’s,\nthen acquisitive and perverse poisons cannot harm them.\n\nTheir bones are frail, their sinews soft,\nyet their grip is firm—\nthis is the **power of the will** (*zhuányì zhī jiān*).\nThey do not yet know the union of male and female,\nyet their movements are complete—\nthis is **vital essence** (*jīng*) at its peak.\nThey do not yet recognize the meeting of male and female,\nyet their **yin** is always strong—\nthis is **fullness of essence** (*jīng quán*).\nThey cry all day, yet their voice does not falter—\nthis is **harmony** (*hé*) at its utmost.\nThough they weep continuously,\ntheir voice never weakens—\nthis is the extreme of harmony.\n\nHarmony is called **constancy** (*cháng*).\nInfants possess these three abilities,\nfor harmony is at its peak in them.\nMen of virtue know this,\nthus they always preserve it.\nConstancy is called **clarity** (*míng*).\nThose who know constancy can be called **clear**.\n\nTo grow further is called **auspiciousness** (*xiáng*).\nTo add even the slightest deviation to nature,\nthis transforms the **auspicious** into the **inauspicious** (*xiáng wéi xiāng*).\nThe heart commands the **qi**—this is called **strength** (*qiáng*).\nHarmonious **qi** is supremely soft,\nyet when the heart grows angry,\nit becomes strong.\n\nWhen things are at their peak, they grow old—\nstrength is the precursor to aging.\nThis is called **not the Dao/Way** (*bù dào*).\nIf one cannot return to youth from old age,\nthen they must lack the **Dao of complete harmony** (*quán hé zhī dào*).\n**Not the Dao** is early decay.\nCommanding them to stop yet they do not—\nthis is the way of the **wise**.\n\nThe **wise** do not speak—\nthose who forget speech,\ntheir wisdom is at its height.\nThose who speak are not **wise**—\nthe unwise, thus, are hindered by speech.\n\nClose their **mouth** (*yuè*).\nDo not gaze with their eyes.\nShut their **gate** (*mén*).\nDo not utter with their lips.\nDull their sharpness—\nthis is to **break their will** (*cuì zhī zhì*).\nResolve their confusion—\nthis is to **empty their minds** (*xū zhī xīn*).\nHarmonize their brightness—\nwhen the time is bright, they are bright.\nBlend with the dust—\nwhen the time is dark, they are dark.\nThis is called **mysterious unity** (*xuán tóng*).\nUnity without distinction.\nThus, they cannot be approached with familiarity—\n**ren** is unseen.\nThey cannot be distanced—\ntheir traces are unstained.\nThey cannot be exploited—\ntheir goodness transcends material things.\nThey cannot be harmed—\nthey do not covet bait.\nThey cannot be despised—\nthey embrace **Dao** and **virtue**.\nThus, they are noble throughout the world.\n\nWhen a man reaches this state,\nonly then can he be the **Dao supreme** (*zhìdào*) for the world.\nTo govern the state with **political measures** (*zhèng*).\nTo use **teachings and commands** (*jiào lìng*).\nTo employ the **unexpected** (*qí*) in warfare,\nto value **deceitful stratagems** (*zhà jì*)—\nthese are the ways of the **two inferior children** (*èr zǐ*).\nTo take the world with **no action** (*wúshì*).\n\nOnly those who take **no action** can win the hearts of the world,\nand thus ascend as **Emperor** and **King**—\nhow can this be compared with the **two inferior children** in their governance?\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nFrom these matters—\nthis is how one knows.\nI know that governing with **political measures** and employing the **unexpected** are insufficient to take the world,\nonly those who take **no action** can win the hearts of the world and rule over them—\nthis is known from the following text.\n\nThe world abounds in **taboos** (*jìhuì*),\nyet the people grow ever poorer—\nthis is the **ruler** who governs with **political measures**,\nwhose prohibitions and commands are dense and intricate,\nso the people fear transgression,\ndaring not to act—\nthus, they grow ever poorer each day.\n\nThe people multiply **sharp implements** (*lìqì*),\nand the state grows ever more **corrupt** (*hūn*).\nThe people all fear death,\nthus they must rely on **weapons** (*gōng shǐ yǐng shǐ*) to guard their lives,\nso the state grows ever more **chaotic and disordered**.\n\nThe people abound in **crafty skills** (*jìqiǎo*),\nand **strange artifacts** arise—\nthis is the **ruler** who employs the **unexpected**,\nwhose ambition lies in warfare,\nwho earnestly loves deceit and the **unexpected**,\nand who also cherishes **offensive and defensive tools**—\nthus, the people must all use their **cleverness** (*rèn zhì*) and **deceit** (*zhà*) to indulge in **strange artifacts**.\n\n**Laws and prohibitions** grow ever more **prominent** (*zī zhāng*),\nand **thieves and bandits** multiply—\n**Laws and artifacts** are the **crafty skills** of men,\ncreated beyond ordinary emotions,\nyet they demand **exalted virtue** (*shàn fèn*).\nThus, many secretly **plunder their forms** (*qiè zhī fǎshì*)\nand **steal their goods** (*dào zhī cáiwù*),\narising from the **fault** of emphasizing **artifacts**.\n\nTherefore, the **Sage** says:\n*\"I take no action, yet the people transform themselves.\nI merely stand in silence, yet the people all transform.\nI love stillness, yet the people align themselves.\nI but maintain my own stillness, yet the people all transform—\nthey do not turn to **evil** (*yé*).\nI take no action, yet the people grow rich.\nI but take no action, and the people do not lose their **livelihood** (*shī yè*),\nso they naturally grow rich.\nI have no desires, yet the people remain **simple** (*pǔ*).\nI but have no desires, yet the people naturally **revere their roots** (*zōng běn*).\nHis governance is **obscured and indistinct** (*mèn mèn*).\nThe **ruler** does not create **affairs** (*shì*) to disturb the people,\nappearing as if **obscured** and unable to act.\nHis people are **pure and sincere** (*chún chún*).\nThe people dwell in **tranquility** (*qīngjìng*),\nthus their **sincerity and thickness** (*dūn hòu*) grow daily.\nHis governance is **piercing and scrutinizing** (*chá chá*).\nThe **ruler’s** policies are strict,\nand the people have no room to move their **hands and feet** (*shǒuzú*).\nThey **dare not act** (*dòng zé chū gāng*).\nThus, they fear and avoid—\nfrom this, they grow ever more **withered and exhausted** (*tiāo cán*).\n\nCalamity (*huò*), indeed,\nis where **auspiciousness** (*fú*) leans upon—\nleaning, meaning **relying** (*yǐ*).\nThe **clever and insightful ruler** (*cōngmíng zhī jūn*)\nreflects upon himself and cultivates **virtue** (*xiū dé*),\ntransforming from **withered and exhausted** to **pure and harmonious** (*chún hé*).\n\n**Auspiciousness** (*fú*), indeed,\nis where calamity (*huò*) lies hidden—\nhidden, meaning **concealed** (*fù*).\nThe **reckless and benighted ruler** (*yōng hūn zhī zhǔ*)\ntakes **pure and harmonious** as his own **virtue** (*dé*),\nthus he **oppresses the law** (*nuè fǎ*),\ntransforming from **pure and harmonious** back to **withered and exhausted**.\n\nWho knows their limits?\nLike **twisted ropes** (*jiǔ chán*).\"\n\n「Is there no true standard?\nCalamity and auspiciousness rely and conceal—\nhow could there be no true standard?\nThere must be a true standard indeed,\nfound in the **ruler who follows the Dao** (*yǒu dào zhī jūn*).\n\nThe true standard becomes the extraordinary,\nthe good becomes the sinister.\nThe confusion of men is long-standing.\n\nTo take the true standard as deceit,\nto regard goodness as folly—\nthis is the common delusion of those who are bewildered.\n\nMen fall into this delusion\nnot in a single morning or evening—\nits origins stretch far back.\n\nThus, the **Sage** (*shèng rén*)\nis square yet does not cut,\nupholding the true standard without reviling the perverse.\n\nHe is straight yet does not overreach,\nnot provoking others to notice him.\n\nHis light shines yet does not dazzle,\npreserving it without ostentation.\n\nHe is frugal yet not filthy—\nnot judging others as unclean because of his own purity.\n\nIn governing men and serving **Heaven** (*tiān*),\nnothing surpasses **frugality** (*sè*).\nFrugality is **modesty** (*jiǎn*).\n\nTo govern men and win their hearts,\nto serve Heaven and align with its **Dao** (*dào*—Way),\nnothing equals **modesty in practice**.\n\nIndeed, only through **frugality** (*sè*)\ndoes one achieve **early submission** (*zǎo fú*).\nOnly those who can truly embody **modest virtue** (*jiǎn dé*)\nwill find all the people willingly submitting early.\n\n**Early submission** is called **laying down deep layers of virtue** (*chóng jī dé*).\nModest virtue is the first layer,\nearly submission the second—\nfrom the first to the second is called **laying down deep layers**.\n\nWhen virtue is deeply layered,\nthere is nothing it cannot achieve.\nAchieve, meaning **capable** (*néng*).\n\nLayered virtue means there is nothing it cannot do.\nIf there is nothing it cannot do,\nits limits are beyond knowing,\nits power is beyond measure.\n\nIf its limits are beyond knowing,\nit can establish a **state** (*guó*).\nIf virtue is beyond measure,\nonly then can one become a **ruler of the land** (*yǒu tǔ zhī jūn*).\n\nA **state** (*guó*) with enduring foundation\ncan last long.\nEnduring, meaning **nourishing** (*yǎng*).\n\nA state with people,\nif governed by the Dao and nourished,\nthen the **altars of earth and grain** (*shèjì*—sacrificial sites) and the **blessings of the ancestral spirits** (*fú zuò*)\ncan endure and grow long-lasting.\n\nThis is called the **Dao of deep-rooted stability and lasting vision** (*chángshēng jiǔshì zhī dào*).\nLike cultivating trees,\nif the roots are deepened, the trunk is firm—\neven with great winds,\nit cannot uproot the roots\nor let its blossoms and fruit fall.\n\nThe words of **layered virtue** (*jī dé*)\nare thus profound in their benefit to the state.\n\nAs for talk of **long life and enduring rule** (*chángshēng jiǔshì*),\nit speaks of the **Sage establishing laws that transcend mortality** (*bù xiǔ*—immortality),\nto bring forth endless blessings for the world,\nnot to preserve a form that obstructs life.\n\n*End of the New Commentary on the Authentic Daoist Classic, Volume Three*\n*Begins the New Commentary on the Authentic Daoist Classic, Volume Four*」\n\n「Li Yue’s Annotation – *Dao Jing* Lower Section\n\nTo govern a great state, as one would cook a small fish.\nIf one cooks a small fish, letting it mature naturally, it remains whole;\ndisturb it, and it spoils.\n\nA skilled ruler of the people lets them find their own way, and they are at peace;\ndisturb them, and they fall into chaos.\n\nWhen the Dao reigns over the world,\nits spirits lose their power.\n\nWhere the Dao’s transformation reaches,\nthe people suffer no calamities—\nthus, its spirits seem without power.\n\nIt is not that the spirits lack power,\nbut that their power does not harm the people.\nThe spirits truly possess power,\nand their power does not damage things.\n\nNor is it that their power does not harm the people—\nthe Sage also does not harm the people.\n\nThe Sage loves the people as a newborn child,\nand the spirits likewise bring them blessings.\n\nThe living and the unseen both find their rightful place,\nunhindered—\nthus, virtue returns in harmony.\n\nThe ruler lacks no offerings to the spirits,\nfor the spirits can confer blessings upon him—\nthus, it is said that his virtue returns in harmony.\n\nA great state is the **lowly stream** (*xiàliú*), the gathering place of the world.\nIf it practices humility with moderation,\nwho would dare not submit?\nThus, states great and small come to pay homage.\n\nThe world’s gathering place is **feminine** (*pǔ*), ever victorious over the **masculine** (*mǔ*) through stillness.\nThe reason why the world’s states come to pay homage\nis that they can dwell in the lowly stream.\n\nAs the feminine prevails over the masculine,\nthis is spoken of in terms of stillness and lowliness—\nfor none seek the masculine when they desire the feminine.\n\nStillness is lowliness.\nThus, the masculine seeks it.\n\nTherefore, a great state that humbles itself beneath smaller states\nwill take them;\na great state that can humble itself\nwill find smaller states sincerely submitting.\n\nA small state that humbles itself beneath a great state\nwill be taken by it;\na small state that can humble itself\nwill be received with courtesy by the great.\n\nThus, sometimes one humbles to take,\nsometimes one humbles and is taken—\nall have their reasons.\n\nA great state seeks only to **encompass and nourish** (*jiānxù*) others;\nthe reason it humbles itself\nis only to encompass and nourish smaller states,\nmaking them tributaries,\nand expand its lands.\n\nA small state seeks only to **enter and serve** (*rùshì*) others.\nThe reason it humbles itself\nis to enter and serve a great state,\nso that other kingdoms dare not rise in arms against it.\n\nBoth achieve their desires,\nfulfilling their ambitions—\nthus, the great should humble itself.\n\nA warning against the great\nis that it might rely on strength rather than practice humility.\n\nThe Dao is the **ultimate mystery** (*ào*) of all things—\nthe Dao, among all things, is the deepest and most mysterious,\nable to **be the foundation** (*gēnpǐn*) for the myriad creatures.\n\nThe treasure of the virtuous person,\nthe Dao of the virtuous person,\nis that by **cultivating the self** (*xiūshēn*), one may attain **long life** (*chángshēng*).\nThus, it is called a treasure.\n\nThe refuge of the unvirtuous person.\nThe unvirtuous person—\nthis refers to the **lowly scholar** (*xiàshì*)—\nhas never sought the Dao.\nWhen disaster strikes,\nthey cling to it as a desperate hope for protection.\n\nSweet words can be **bartered** (*shì*).\nIn trade,\nthose who can **delight in their speech** (*gān cí*)\nfind easy assembly when they go forth,\neasy acquisition when they seek.\n\nNoble conduct can **elevate others** (*jiārén*).\nThose whose deeds are exalted\ncan first **teach and guide** (*jiào jiā*) others.\n\nWhat is there to **abandon** (*qì*) in the unvirtuous?\nNo one is without virtue—\nonly that their transformation has not yet reached its fullness.\n\nThus, when establishing the **Son of Heaven** (*Tiānzǐ*) and appointing the **Three Exalted Ministers** (*sāngōng*),\nthe Son of Heaven is the **master of the myriad people** (*wànmín zhī zhǔ*).\nHe wishes to entrust them with his Dao,\nso that they may transform the unvirtuous—\nyet fears they might neglect his Dao.\nThus, he further appoints the Three Exalted Ministers to assist him.\n\nEven with a **jewel-embossed tablet** (*gǒngbì*) and **fine steeds** (*liángmǎ*) presented before the carriage,\nit is not as good as **simply presenting this Dao** (*zuòjìn zhī dào*).\n\nThe Three Exalted Ministers may offer a jewel-embossed tablet\nand fine steeds before the carriage,\nbut this is merely the duty of loyal ministers.\nYet it is not as good as\n**simply presenting this profound and mysterious Dao to the ruler** (*zuòjìn zhī shēn’ào zhī dào*)\nto gather the **abundant and harmonious transformations** (*yōngxī zhī huà*).\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this in such esteem?\nBecause they wished to **reveal and clarify the marvels of the Dao** (*fā míng dào miào*).\nThus, this question was posed.»\n\nThe Sage asks, *\"Why not seek it daily and obtain it?\"*\nThe reply is: *\"Because it cannot be sought daily and obtained in a day—\none must span generations, accumulate merit and practice over time,\nand only then achieve it.\"*\n\n**Shall one with completed virtue and perfected Dao be exempt from punishment?**\nEven if he commits offenses against the ruler’s will—\nlike touching a dragon’s scales—\nhe shall be spared execution and blame.\n*\"Exempt\"* is but an expression of praise.\nThus, he is held in highest esteem by all ages.\n\n**Wuwei**—to act without action—\n**sheng**—to nurture life within the heart—\n**ze**—to follow patterns—\nthese disrupt the heart.\n\n**Wuwu**—to act without pretense—\n**shi**—to act from true intent—\n**you**—to have affairs—\nthese cloud the will.\n\n**Wuwei**—to taste without indulgence—\nThose who savor flavors excessively\nleave their palates parched.\n\n**Great and small, much and little**—\nRepay resentment with virtue.\nVirtue is the highest of the three *\"Wu\"*s.\nIf a man practices these three virtues,\nhis heart shall be clear and bright.\nA clear heart perceives resentment at its first stirrings—\nif it arises from trifles and is cut off,\nthere shall be no great resentment;\nif it arises from slight matters and is removed,\nthere shall be no excess.\nThus repaid, what resentment remains?\nResentment is the root of chaos, confusion, and depletion.\n\n**Difficulties arise from ease**—\nfor what is small is easy.\n**Greatness stems from the minute**—\nfor what is little is fine.\n\nGreat undertakings of the world must begin with ease,\nand grand affairs must arise from the minute.\nThis is an inevitable principle.\nThe wise planner acts when omens first appear.\n\nThus, the Sage never pursues the grand;\nhe is most cautious at the outset.\nTherefore, he achieves the great.\n\nFrom this arises the Sage.\n\nHe who makes light of promises shall lack trustworthiness.\nHe who preserves sincerity\nmust weigh his words carefully.\n\nWhat is easy in the beginning shall bring many difficulties.\nThose who do not foresee the end\nmake every matter seem easy.\nThus, even the Sage finds it difficult,\nfor he is cautious at the start.\nTherefore, there are no lasting difficulties.\n\nWhat is hard at first becomes easy by the end.\nWhat is stable is easy to uphold;\nwhat is not yet manifest is easy to plan against.\nPreventing it before it arises—\nthis is why it is easy.\nWhat is brittle is easy to shatter,\nso its beginnings are easy to disperse.\nIf removed at its first emergence,\nit shall not become difficult.\n\nAct before it exists;\ngovern before it is disordered.\nThis is the way of the wise and diligent.\n\nA tree thick enough to embrace\ngrows from a slender shoot—\nyet once grown, it cannot be uprooted.\n\nA nine-tiered tower\nbegins with a single clod of earth—\nyet once built, it cannot be concealed.\n\nA thousand-li journey\nbegins with a single step—\nyet once begun, it cannot be halted.\n\nThe doer brings about ruin.\nThe doer is the one who removes the seeds of calamity,\nyet allows them to grow and mature—\nthus it is called ruin.\nRuined things may still be restored.\n\nThe grasper loses.\nThe grasper, by nurturing evil and failing to refine,\nultimately leads to extinction—\nthus it is called loss.\nLost things cannot be revived again.\n\nThe Sage acts not, hence knows no ruin.\nRuins arise from action—\nwhat is not acted upon, how can it be ruined?\nThe Sage holds nothing, hence knows no loss.\nLoss stems from grasping—\nwhat is not grasped, how can it be lost?\n\nThe people’s undertakings\noften fail just as they near completion,\nfor they have beginnings but no endings.\nIf one is as cautious at the end as at the start,\nthere will be no failed endeavors.\nIf the roots and ends remain unweakened,\nnothing will fail to be accomplished.\n\nThus the Sage desires not what he desires not,\nand does not prize hard-to-obtain treasures.\nHe desires what others do not desire,\nso he regards gold and jade as discarded soil.\n\nHe teaches what is not taught,\nto correct the common errors of the people,\nand teaches what others do not learn,\nso he can restrain the excesses of all living things.\nHe aids the natural unfolding of all things,\npracticing these two courses\nto assist all things in returning to their original nature.\nHe does not dare to act.\nHe guards and is cautious, so he does not dare to act recklessly.\n\nThe ancients who mastered the Dao\nexplained to those who knew the ancient Way,\nwishing that the rulers of the present age would emulate them.\nThey did not enlighten the people openly,\nfor if they revealed the Dao to the people,\nthey feared it would inspire strange ambitions.\nInstead, they sought to deceive them.\nThey subtly permeated them with the Dao,\nso that they would return to their original simplicity.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern\nbecause their cleverness is excessive.\nWhen cunning is excessive, they harbor deceit and slander—\nthus they are difficult to manage.\nTherefore, governing with cleverness is the ruin of the state.\nIf those with excessive cleverness govern,\nthey will certainly implement corrupt policies,\nand the people will be in chaos—\nthus it is the ruin of the state.\nNot governing with cleverness is the state’s blessing.\nIf one governs with sincerity and simplicity,\none will certainly practice non-action,\nand the people will be at ease—\nthus it is the state’s blessing.\n\nThese two principles are the models.\n*Lǎi* (楷) is the pattern; *shì* (式) is the law.\nOne is ruin, the other is blessing.\nThese two are also very easy to discern—\nknowing them, one should avoid harm and embrace benefit.\n\nTo always know the models is called *Xuán Dé* (玄德).\nTo always know that blessings can be embraced and ruin avoided,\nand to bring the common people to great peace—\nthis is the ruler’s unfathomable virtue.\n\n*Xuán Dé* is profound and distant,\ncontrary to the ways of things.\nIts hidden virtue is deep and unknowable,\nfar and unsearchable.\nOnly thus can one restore all things to their natural state.\nThen, all will return to their original purity,\nand nothing will be out of harmony.\n\n「The rivers and seas are able to be the sovereign of all the valleys because they excel in yielding.\nThus, they are able to be the sovereign of all the valleys.\n*Sovereign* (王者) means *to go forth* (往也).\nThe rivers and seas excel in dwelling beneath the myriad streams,\nand thus all the valleys converge and gather without fail.\nTherefore, the sage is one who can emulate the rivers and seas.\n\nTo rise above others, one must first yield in speech;\nTo dwell above others, one must first yield in speech to them.\nTo surpass others, one must first place oneself behind them;\nTo dwell before others, one must retreat one’s own person behind them.\n\nThus, though in a position above, people do not feel burdened,\nand all willingly revere and uphold him—\nyet he is still considered light.\nThough at the forefront, people are not harmed,\nand all gladly follow without resentment or injury.\nThus, he delights in promoting and never tires.\n\nThis is the power of *humility*.\nBecause he does not contend, none under heaven can contend with him.\nI use *humility* (谦德) to transform the people below,\nand they, transformed, all become *retreat and yield* (退让).\n\nAll under heaven say, “His Dao is vast, yet he seems unworthy.”\nAll under heaven say, “His Dao is vast, yet he seems unvirtuous.”\nOnly because it is vast does it seem unworthy.\nI tell them: the great person’s folly is beyond reach.\nIf *worthy* (肖) were long-lasting, how trifling it would be!\nIf *virtue* (贤) were to let others attain it,\nthis would be the most trifling of all under heaven for long.\n\nI possess three treasures—\nthough I am unworthy, I have three practices,\nwhich can be called the most precious of *cultivating the self and governing the state*.\n*Treasure* (宝) and *hold* (持).\nIf people regard them as treasures and hold them without abandon,\nthen where can one go without benefit?\nThe first is *compassion* (慈), which is *benevolence* (仁).\nThe second is *frugality* (俭), which is *restraint* (约).\nThe third is *not daring to be first under heaven*—\ndwelling behind all actions.\n\n*Compassion* (慈) thus enables *courage* (勇);\n*courage* to *rescue and aid* (济物).\n*Frugality* (俭) thus enables *broadness* (广);\n*restraint* (节用) thus yields this abundance.\nNot daring to be first under heaven,\nthus one achieves *longevity* (长).\n*Self-effacement* (自下) leads to completion,\nand *ascending to greatness* (升高) fulfills achievements—\nthus one attains to be the sovereign of all under heaven.\n*Emperor Yao* (尧) was the sovereign of the Nine Regions—this is the same.\n\nNow, if one abandons *compassion* and yet has *courage*,\n*courage* without *benevolence* will harm others.\nIf one abandons *frugality* and yet seeks *broadness*,\n*excess* without restraint will surely appear.\nIf one abandons *yielding* and yet seeks to be first,\n*placing oneself before others* (先己) while neglecting them,\npeople will surely harbor resentment.\n*Death* (死矣).\nIf these three practices are missing even one,\n*death* (死矣) will follow—\nhow much more so if none are practiced at all?\n\n*Compassion* (慈): when waging war, it ensures victory;\nwhen defending, it ensures stability.\nThe general who can use *compassion* to nurture and care for his soldiers,\nthe soldiers’ hearts will not waver—\nthus, when waging war, he will be victorious,\nand when defending, he will be steadfast.\nHeaven will aid him,\nwith *compassion* as his shield.\n*Compassion* moves Heaven,\nand Heaven thus aids and rescues,\nfor the general can use *compassion* as his shield for the soldiers.\n\nThe skilled general is not fierce,\nfor he relies on *Dao* rather than force.\nThose who delight in battle are not angry,\nfor they rely on *strategy* rather than rage.\nThe skilled victor does not contend,\nfor he relies on *virtue* rather than strife.\nThe skilled user of men places himself below them,\nfor he relies on *humility* rather than power.\n\nThis is called the *virtue of non-contention*,\nthis is called the *power of using men*,\nthis is called *harmonizing with Heaven*—\nthe ultimate of the ancients.\nThe four virtues above,\nif one can practice them, none will fail to respond.\nThus, one attains to *align with Heaven’s Way*—\nthe ultimate attainment of the ancients.\n\nOn waging war, there is a saying:\n*Follow the ruler’s inclinations and advance one’s Dao*.\nThe saying on waging war is in the following passage.\n\nI do not dare to be the *master of the master* (主主),\nfirst stirring others to action.\nInstead, I am the *guest* (客),\nand the *guest* harmonizes without singing lead.\nI do not dare to advance even an inch without right,\nbut retreat a foot.\nI defend myself and await changes.\n\nThis is called *action without action*—\nthe enemy is my border,\nand I advance only to stop them—\nnot harboring intentions of slaughter or conquest.\n*Repelling without arms*—\nthere is no anger that does not repel,\nthus it seems as though one has no arms.\n*Yet there is no enemy*—\nnot contending for victory,\nthus one does not provoke battle.\n*Grasping without weapons*—\nrelying on *virtue* rather than force.\n\nNo greater calamity than *lightly regarding the enemy*—\nthe *guest’s* way has no greater beginning than this.\nTo lightly regard the enemy risks losing my treasures.\n*Treasure* (宝) is the *self* (身).\nIf one lightly regards the enemy and presses deep,\nthere will be none who do not carry corpses away.\nThus, when armies clash in battle,\nthe one whose soldiers are filled with *compassion* will win.\nTwo states raise their armies,\nthe *guest* and *host* forces are evenly matched—\nwhen they meet in battle and achieve victory,\nthe one whose *compassion* is deeply rooted among his soldiers will triumph.\n\nMy words are very easy to know,\nvery easy to practice.\nSaying my words are *non-action*,\nthey are easy to know.\nIf one wishes to practice them,\nwhat difficulty could there be?\n\nYet none under heaven can know them,\nnone can practice them.\nAll under heaven are in turmoil,\nall following *action* (有为).\n*Action* and *non-action* are opposed,\nand thus none can practice them.\n\nWords have a *root* (宗),\naffairs have a *lord* (君).\n*Dao* is the *root*,\n*virtue* is the *lord*.\nOnly because of *ignorance* (无知),\nthey do not know me.\n*Ignorance* means their *perception* (识) does not reach *principle* (理).\n\nIf people cannot know my profound words,\nor practice my *non-action*,\nthen how can *virtue and power* reach their utmost?\n\nFew know me,\nfor the world has few who can know my *virtue and power*.\nThus, I am precious.\nThose who know me and follow my example\nare without compare in their preciousness.\n\nTherefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.\nWithin, he holds the supreme treasure,\nwithout, he lacks ostentatious display—\nthus, none under heaven can know him.\n\n*Knowing the unknowable*—\nthis is *superior* (上).\n*Perceiving all things*—\nthough one claims to know nothing,\nthis is true knowledge—\nis it not *superior*?\n\n*Not knowing the knowable*—\nthis is *illness* (病).\nStanding before a wall,\nknowing nothing yet claiming to know all—\nthis is a deluded person,\nis it not *illness*?\n\nOnly because one *diseases illness*,\ndoes one not fall ill.\nThe true knower\nis able to regard *false knowledge* as illness and disease it,\nand thus true knowledge is not ill,\nwhile false knowledge is diseased.\n\nThe sage does not fall ill,\nfor he diseases illness.\nIf he were to fall ill himself,\nhe would not be able to disease others.\n\n---\n*(Note: This translation follows the conventions of the previous section, including the use of \"Dao/Way\" for 道, \"qi\" for 氣, and context-dependent translations of 德. Technical terms such as \"sovereign\" (王者), \"compassion\" (慈), and \"frugality\" (俭) are preserved as in the prior section.)*\n\nIs thus without illness.\nTo test this, it is clear that one does not fall ill.\n\nPeople do not fear great threat,\nso great threat arrives.\nThe greatest of threats—\ndeath.\n\nAll take minor evils as harmless,\nyet they accumulate until they fill the measure.\nWhen the measure is full and death comes,\nis this not the arrival of great threat?\n\nDo not narrow your dwelling.\nThe dwelling of the spirit—\nthe heart—\nbecomes narrow with many desires.\n\nDo not exhaust what sustains you.\nThe giver of life—\nthe spirit—\nlingers if not exhausted.\nOnly because one does not exhaust it,\ndoes one not exhaust it.\n\nIf one can attain emptiness and clarity,\nthen the human and the spirit will be in harmony.\nThus, the sage knows himself and knows emptiness,\nand the spirit lingers.\nNot seeing oneself—\nif one sees oneself,\nthen one does not fear great threat.\nSelf-exhaustion is not cherishing life.\nNot valuing oneself—\nif one values oneself,\nthen one narrows one’s dwelling.\n\nThus, abandon that and take this:\nabandon self-regard and self-aggrandizement,\ntake self-knowledge and self-love.\n\nTo dare boldly is to kill;\nif one dares boldly in desire,\nthen Heaven will surely kill them.\nTo dare not to dare is to live.\nIf one dares not to dare in desire,\nthen all under Heaven will surely live them.\nAlways know these two:\ndaring and not daring.\nOne brings benefit, the other harm.\nNot daring brings benefit,\ndaring brings harm.\n\nWhat does Heaven abhor?\nWho knows its reason?\nHeaven abhors daring boldness.\nThus, the sage finds it difficult.\nThis is how one understands Heaven’s abhorrence.\n\nThe Way of Heaven—\nexplaining the Way of Heaven to admonish humanity—\nvictory without strife,\nthough Heaven follows things,\nwho dares not obey its command?\nResponding without speech,\nthough there are no spoken teachings,\nthe four seasons and myriad things\ndo not fail to respond.\nComing without being summoned,\nthough not called,\nthe three luminaries shine in order.\nMysterious and yet well-planned.\nMysterious to the utmost,\nyet in killing the daring and preserving the nondaring,\nnever lacking—\ndrawing the bow by night,\nnever erring.\nIf such is the case,\nit is as if within there is a master of fine strategy.\n\nHeaven’s net is vast,\nsparse yet nothing escapes.\nThough the mesh is vast and wide,\nthe wicked cannot evade it.\nPeople do not commonly fear death,\nalready constrained by punishments and laws.\nHow can one use death to instill fear?\nIf one further threatens with death penalties,\nwho would fear it?\n\nIf one makes people constantly fear death,\nand governs with leniency,\nthen people will not lightly risk their lives.\nAs for those who act strangely,\nI can seize and kill them—\nwho would dare?\n\nWithin the fear of death,\nsome may feign resistance to the law.\nBy the authority of my lordship,\nI must seize and kill them.\nWhat they do not dare—\nis to usurp Heaven’s role.\nLet those who hold the power to kill,\nkill.\nThus, there will be no leakage of steel.\n\nTo usurp the role of executioner\nis like a clumsy artisan taking the chisel from a master.\nTo have the ruler usurp Heaven\nis like a clumsy man taking the place of a skilled artisan.\nIf one who cannot replaces one who can,\nthe unrefined block will not be hewn,\nand the hand will surely be injured.\n\nThe people’s hunger\ncomes from their rulers’ excessive taxation.\nThus, they hunger.\nIf the ruler imposes heavy levies,\nthe people below will lack.\nThus, they hunger.\n\nThe difficulty in governing people\ncomes from the ruler’s actions.\nThus, it is difficult to govern.\nIf the ruler takes on many tasks,\nthe people below will devise schemes to counter them,\nmaking governance difficult.\n\nPeople’s disregard for death\ncomes from their rulers’ excessive pursuit of life.\nThus, they disregard death.\nThis speaks of people’s reliance on their ruler—\nif the ruler greedily hoards excessive nourishment,\ndemands beyond measure,\nthe people’s ten households are nine in want,\nall resenting their ruler,\nand the ruler meets ruin—\nis this not disregarding death?\n\nOnly those who do not cling to life\nare wiser than those who value life.\nTo enrich life leads to its destruction,\nto abandon life preserves it.\nComparing these,\nthose who do not value life are wiser than those who do.\n\nWhen life is soft and weak,\nthe Way is present.\nWhen death is firm and strong,\nthe Way departs.\nAll things—grasses and trees—\nwhen alive, are soft and tender,\nfor *qi* is present.\nWhen dead, they wither and dry,\nfor *qi* has dispersed.\nThus, the firm and strong belong to death,\nthe soft and weak belong to life.\nThis is evident to the eye.\n\nThus, strong armies do not conquer.\nWarfare is an inauspicious instrument,\ncontrary to Heaven’s love of life,\nso it is suppressed—\nmaking the strong not conquer.\n\nWood that is strong rots.\nWood is naturally strong in its trunk,\nyet its branches and boughs are weak,\nso the weak branches grow from the strong trunk.\nThe strong is below,\nthe weak is above.\nCombining life and death,\nthe weak lives while the strong dies—\ncomparing this above,\nthe weak is above,\nthe strong is below.\nYet they strive to be below and invite death—\nhow deeply inverted!\n\nThe Way of Heaven—\nlet me liken it to drawing a bow.\nUsing what people understand to explain the difficulty of knowing the Way of Heaven,\nthen even from afar, it can be seen.\nThe high are lowered,\nthe low are raised,\nthe excessive are diminished,\nthe insufficient are supplemented.\nLowering the high and raising the low,\ndiminishing the excessive and supplementing the insufficient—\ndrawing the bow thus,\nonly then can one hit the mark.\n\nThe Way of Heaven\ndiminishes the excessive and supplements the insufficient.\nWhen the sun reaches its zenith, it declines—\nthis is diminishing.\nWhen the moon wanes, it waxes anew—\nthis is supplementing.\n*Suò*—to revive.\n\nThe Way of humanity is not so.\nHuman ways oppose the Way of Heaven—\nthis is the speech of dark rulers and common folk.\nThey diminish the insufficient to serve the excessive,\nthus taking from the lacking to enrich the having.\nWho can use the excessive to serve all under Heaven?\nOnly the Daoist ruler.\nWho can align with Heaven?\nOnly the Daoist ruler—\nas sovereign, he restrains the strong and comforts the weak,\nas a person, he aids the needy with wealth.\nThis speaks of the virtuous ruler and wise scholar.\n\nThus, the sage acts without relying on it,\ncompletes the work without dwelling on it,\nnot desiring to be seen as virtuous.\nHe does not boast of his excellence,\nnor does he dwell on his virtue—\nfor he does not wish for things to see his virtue.\n\nUnder Heaven, nothing is softer or weaker than water.\nObserve how it conforms to the vessel and follows humanity—\nwho can surpass it?\n\nWhile attacking the firm and strong, none can overcome it—\nits way cannot be altered.\nThe way water overcomes hardness is unchangeable.\nSoftness overcomes hardness, weakness overcomes strength—\nall under Heaven know this, yet none can practice it.\nWater overcomes hardness, so one knows softness overcomes hardness;\nhumility makes others submit, so one knows weakness overcomes strength.\nThis all under Heaven knows in theory,\nyet when it comes to practice, none can do it.\n\nThus the sage says:\nTo bear a nation’s filth is called the master of the ancestral altars.\nWhat people detest is filth,\nyet the sage can endure it, hence he is the master of the ancestral altars.\nTo bear a nation’s misfortunes is called the king of all under Heaven.\nWhat people fear is misfortune,\nyet the sage can embrace it, hence he is the king of all under Heaven.\nStraight speech seems reversed.\nThose who practice softness and weakness\nbecome lords and kings—\nthis is truly straight speech,\nyet common preference for hardness and strength makes it seem reversed.\n\nTo reconcile great grudges—\ngrudges arise from unsettled *qi* in the heart.\nReconciliation means leaving them without cause.\nYet grudges will remain;\nif one uses affairs to reconcile them,\nthen one only exacerbates their resentment.\nHow can this be called good?\nIf one exacerbates their resentment,\nthen naturally it becomes evil.\n\nThus the sage holds the left contract,\ndemanding nothing of others.\nThe left contract is not used in official matters.\nA contract is a token of mutual agreement.\nThe sage holds his heart without resentment,\nmerely thinking to align with the *qi* of all people,\nso that naturally there is no grudge—\nwhy demand anything of others?\nThus, the virtuous ruler oversees contracts:\nif one is good at reconciling grievances,\none merely oversees mutual agreement with the people.\nThe unvirtuous oversees *chè* (clarification).\nIf one meddles in reconciling grudges,\none only oversees matters to clearly demonstrate to the people—\ngrudges arise from this, how can it be called reconciliation?\n*Chè* means clarification.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven has no favorites,\nalways aiding the virtuous.\nThe ruler with virtue is virtuous,\nand the Dao of Heaven always bestows blessings upon him.\nIn small states with few people,\ngoverning the great as if it were small—\nthe intent is to simplify and reduce taxes,\nto bring peace to the people.\n\nLet there be ten or a hundred implements,\nyet they are not used.\n*Shí* means things; *bǎi* means completion.\nImplements are the resources people use for livelihood.\nBecause the ruler does not act,\nthe people possess these resources—\neven if there are a hundred, they are not taxed for use.\nThe people value life and take joy in their work,\nso they do not lightly risk death.\nNor do they move far away.\nThis is because there are no harsh policies.\nThough there are boats and carriages,\nthere is no need to ride them—\nboats can cross water, carriages can travel on land,\nyet the people are self-sufficient, so there is no need to ride them.\nThough there are armor and weapons,\nthere is no need to display them—\narmor and weapons are the ruler’s tools of utility,\nyet because of non-action, there is no need to display them.\nThe people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.\nThis is to revert to antiquity.\n\nThe people find their food sweet,\nknowing contentment,\nso all they eat is sweet.\n\nThey adorn their dress beautifully,\nyet stop at what is proper,\nso there is no attire that is not beautiful.\n\nThey dwell in peace,\ntheir desires extinguished,\nso even a humble lane brings them ease.\n\nThey take joy in their customs—\nwithout strife, their customs naturally bring them delight.\n\nNeighboring states are close enough to see,\nwhere the sounds of roosters and dogs intermingle,\nfor they are near.\n\nThe people live until old age and death,\nyet do not visit one another—\nthey seek nothing from one another.\n\nTruthful speech is not eloquent;\ntruthful speech is the Way,\nso bland it lacks flavor,\nand thus is not eloquent.\n\nEloquent speech is not truthful;\neloquent speech is alluring,\nso sweet it lacks sincerity.\n\nThe virtuous do not argue;\nthe virtuous value action,\nnot idle discourse.\n\nThose who argue are not virtuous.\nObstructed speech is not practiced,\nand thus is not virtuous.\n\nThe wise are not all-knowing;\nthe wise value non-action.\nThe all-knowing are not wise—\nlike those who prize learning yet remain ignorant.\n\nThe Sage does not hoard;\nhoarding yet knowing how to disperse,\nthe more one gives to others, the more one possesses.\nThey manifest virtue to teach others,\nand as people receive its benefit,\nthe Sage’s virtue grows ever clearer—\nlike a mirror reflecting all,\npeople see their own virtues and flaws,\nthe flawed refine themselves,\nthe virtuous redouble their efforts,\nyet the mirror’s clarity never wanes.\n\nThe more one gives to others, the more one has.\nThey distribute wealth to relieve the poor,\nand though the poor gain aid,\nthe Sage’s wealth is never exhausted—\nlike a well from which all may draw,\nthose who draw gain its benefit,\nyet the well is never drained.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is beneficial yet does no harm;\nHeaven’s Dao is yang,\nso it cherishes life and abhors killing.\nCherishing life is why it is called beneficial,\nabhorring killing is why it is called doing no harm.\n\nThe Sage’s Way acts yet does not contend.\nThe Sage’s actions always align with nature,\nand all things respectfully follow.\n\n*(End of Volume Four of the Newly Annotated True Classic of the Dao and Virtue)*",

what need has he of it?\nHe acts without relying on it,\nFor what is achieved is his virtue—\nWhat need has he to boast of it?\n\nWhen virtue is fulfilled yet he does not dwell upon it,\nThis is why he is not abandoned.\nWithout effort yet in accord with principle,\nThis is called \"not dwelling,\"\nAnd virtue naturally accomplished—\nThis is called \"not being abandoned.\"\n\nHe does not exalt the worthy,\nSo the people do not contend;\nIf he does not exalt his own worth,\nWho would dare to contend with him?\nHe does not prize difficult-to-obtain goods,\nSo the people do not steal;\nIf he does not covet what others desire,\nAll would naturally turn from it—\nWho then would steal?\n\nHe does not show what is desirable,\nSo the heart remains undisturbed.\nTo all who oppose him,\nHe forgets them utterly—\nThen the heart will naturally be still.\n\nThus, the Sage embodies these principles:\nEmpty his mind, and external things will not enter within.\nFill his belly, and the Original Unity will not leave without.\nWeaken his resolve, and he will think only of softness.\nStrengthen his bones, and he will preserve his essence.\n\nAlways make people ignorant and without desire,\nAnd this is the principle—\nThus, humanity returns to simplicity.\nLet the wise not dare to act,\nAnd those who see the return to simplicity will strive to align with it.\n\nAct in non-action,\nAnd nothing will remain ungoverned.\nDo not lose non-action,\nAnd you will not suffer from disorder.\n\nThe *Dao* is open yet responds to all things,\nEmptying himself to meet their needs.\nSome do not fulfill their purpose,\nSo virtue is complete when its time arrives.\n\nDeep and still, like the source of all things.\nDeeply tranquil, unfathomable—\nThus, it appears as the teacher of all classes.\n\nDulling their sharpness,\nHe restrains the grasping of gain.\nUnraveling their entanglements,\nHe resolves all grudges and resentments.\nBlending their brightness,\nHe harmonizes their clarity.\nUniting their dust,\nHe enters their obscurity.\n\nGleaming yet indistinct,\nLike something that may or may not exist.\nHis use is without differentiation,\nHis nature without mixture.\nI do not know whose child he is,\nBut I recognize his ability—\nNo one knows his parent.\nHe resembles the state before the Emperor.\n\nThe Emperor is the origin of all things,\nAnd all transformations follow after—\nOnly the *Dao* can dwell before him.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent;\nBenevolence is favor.\nFavor arises from the heart,\nAnd Heaven and Earth have no heart—\nHow could they be benevolent?\nThey treat all things as fodder for horses.\nFodder is grass;\nRepayment springs from sentiment,\nAnd fodder has no sentiment—\nHow could there be repayment?\n\nThe Sage is not benevolent,\nFollowing the *Dao* of Heaven and Earth’s heartlessness,\nYet he empties his mind and rests in simplicity—\nWhat need has he of benevolence?\nHe treats the people as fodder for horses.\nThe people, like fodder, are without sentiment,\nThus he forgets the Emperor’s power beneath them.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nIt is like a bellows.\nThe bellows has no bottom,\nYet when struck, it never ceases to produce heat—\nAt home, it uses wind to fan the flames.\nThe *zhi* is like a flute;\nSkilled musicians blow into it to make music.\nBoth are empty within yet without sentiment,\nThus they respond endlessly to demands.\n\nHeaven and Earth are like this,\nHence they are not benevolent.",

      "translated_text": "「Empty yet never yielding, yielding is exhaustion.\nEmpty, thus never exhausted.\nMove and it overflows—\nHence the more it moves, the more it responds.\nMany words bring exhaustion,\nBetter to guard the center.\n\nWith intent to speak, then there is a time when it fails;\nEmpty within yet responding, then there is no day when it is exhausted.\nThe *Gu* spirit does not die—\nWithin the *Gu*, empty, it can echo with sound in reply.\nWho knows the one that answers the sound?\nSince it is unknown and unfathomable,\nIt is called the spirit—spirit answers, everlasting, why?\n\nHumans can empty their hearts,\nThen nothing fails to respond—\nAs the spirit never departs the body, everlasting.\n\nThis is called the *Xuan Dan*.\n*Xuan* is profound darkness;\n*Dan* is the female.\n\nThe female dwells in secluded chambers—\nThis is the *Xuan Dan*.\nIts nature is soft and tranquil,\nNot harming within from without,\nThus it can govern the unfathomable spirit within itself.\n\nAgain, the *Xuan* is the nose, the *Dan* is the mouth—\nEmpty and spacious, inhaling and exhaling the primordial *qi*,\nThe root of yin and yang.\n\nThe gate of the *Xuan Dan*—\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nTo act as the *Xuan Dan*,\nOne may call it the gate to attaining the *Dao*.\nOnce the *Dao* is attained,\nThen the *Dao* becomes the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nEndless and subtle, the *Dao*’s body\nSeems unable to sustain itself,\nYet it exists eternally, from past to future.\nUse it without exhaustion—\nThough subtle, its application\nNever declines in weariness.\n\nIf humans can attain it,\nThen their nature is whole, their spirit sovereign—\nAchieving boundless longevity.\n\nAgain, it speaks of the *tu nà* method.\nHeaven is vast, Earth is enduring—\nNow, the market has not yet lacked it.\nHeaven and Earth endure long,\nBecause they do not generate themselves—\nThus they attain eternal life.\nThe reason they attain eternal life,\nIs that they do not cultivate their own life yet possess it.\n\nThus the Sage can emulate Heaven and Earth.\nRetreat behind his own body, yet his body advances—\nThe reason he surpasses others,\nIs that he excels through self-effacement.\n\nExclude his own body, yet his body remains—\nThe reason he is not endangered,\nIs that he can diminish himself.\nNot because he lacks selfishness,\nBut because he can fulfill others’ selfishness—\nOthers’ selfishness may not succeed,\nYet his own selfishness is already fulfilled.\n\nThe highest virtue is like water.\nThe most virtuous person follows water’s nature.\nWater benefits all things,\nAll things receive its nourishment.\nYet it does not contend—\nIt excels in humility and compliance.\nWhere people detest,\nThe lowest flows—\nAll the world’s detestations gather there,\nPeople avoid it,\nWater alone dwells there.\nThus it nears the *Dao*.\n*Ji* means proximity.\nReside in the best land—\nQuiet dwelling is best in land.\nHeart is best in depth—\nCalm the heart, best in depth.\nGive with virtue—\nBestow giving, virtue excels.\nSpeak with trust—\nFulfill speech, trust excels.\nGovern with skill—\nRule with governance, skill excels.\nDo with ability—\nAct with ability, ability excels.\nMove with timing—\nMotion with timing, timing excels.\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\nThus it has no blame.\n*You* means fault—\nWater’s nature is such,\nVirtuous people follow it,\nThus they dwell in faultless ground.\n\nHold and fill it,\nBetter to stop and rest in the center.\n*Yi* means cease.\nCarry and sharpen it,\nIt cannot be long preserved.\nGrind until it is sharpest,\nPreserve its unbreakable nature—\nThis has never been heard before.\n*Chuài* means to grind,\n*Ruì* means thinness.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can guard them;\nProfit brings harm—\nAccumulate, and it will kill the body—\nWho says they can guard?\n\nRich and noble yet proud,\nThey invite their own misfortune.\nHigh in station yet arrogant,\nDisaster gathers itself—\nHow can they blame others?\n\nFunction accomplished,\nAffairs fulfilled,\nRetreat the body—\nThis is the *Dao* of Heaven.\nTo seek function and achieve it,\nTo plot affairs and see them through,\nThen one should retreat the body,\nNot dwelling in extreme heights—\nThis aligns with Heaven’s *Dao* of moderation.\n\nNurture the *hun* and preserve the *pò*—\nCan one not depart from unity?\nHuman life must nurture the *hun*—\nThe *hun* is the yang spirit,\nThe yang spirit desires life.\nThe *pò* is the yin ghost,\nThe yin ghost desires death.\nThus, the *Laozi* teaches the method of guarding and nurturing,\nSo that the spirit does not recklessly depart and bring calamity.\n\nThe method of guarding and nurturing,\nHas no greater principle than preserving unity.\nUnity means singular focus—\nPreserve a focused heart,\nThus the *pò* has no way to leave the body,\nIn harmony with the previous state.\n\nConcentrate the *qi* to achieve softness—\nCan one be like an infant?\nTo concentrate and nourish harmonious *qi*,\nCan one reach the softness of a newborn’s body?\n\nPurify and cast off the profound vision—\nCan one be without blemish?\nProfound vision is the heart—\nThe heart is clear and penetrating,\nThough in the depths, it can survey and know.\nAll people have many desires,\nExhausting themselves without measure,\nThus flaws arise,\nUnable to illuminate clearly—\nHence the command to use the *Dao* to wash and purify,\nRemoving its dust and burdens.\n\nLove the people, govern the state—\nCan one achieve *wu wei*?\nIf one’s body is cultivated,\nOne has never heard of their state not being well-ordered.\nThe people are the root of the state—\n*Wu wei* is the key to governance.\nIf one attains the key to governance,\nAnd applies it to their state,\nThis is called loving the people and governing the state.\n\nThe gates of Heaven open and close—\nCan one act as the female?\nHeaven aids those with virtue,\nAnd the loving-people ruler uses the female principle—\nQuiet and still, never straying from the *Dao*—\nThus the gates of Heaven remain open,\nGranting them blessings and longevity,\nOtherwise, they close.\n\nBright and all-pervading—\nCan one be without knowing?\nThere is supreme virtue like the sun,\nIlluminating all—\nCan one make all beneath it unaware?\nBorn yet not possessed—\nIf possessed, then those beneath know.\nAct yet not rely—\nIf relied upon, then it is not the Sage.\nLong yet not domineering—\nThings do not know where life originates.\nThis is called profound virtue—\nThe utmost of mysterious operation.\n\nThirty spokes converge at one hub—\nWhen the hub is absent, the wheel’s use exists.\nInitially, the wheel was formed,\nWith a single spoke as its rim—\nWithout thirty spokes, it could not revolve and move.\nThe wheel’s utility,\nDepends on the emptiness within its frame.»",

deceitful reviled them.\n\nWhen trust is lacking, distrust arises.\nAt first, they lured with falsehood—\nThis is why trust was lacking.\nLater, they showed sincerity—\nYet people still did not believe them.\n\nThey still valued words.\nNot knowing that words should be valued less than trust,\nThey reached this ruin—\nYet they still valued words,\nSo the pure and harmonious winds could not prevail.\n\nWhen deeds were accomplished and affairs settled,\nThe people said, *\"It happened naturally.\"*\nBecause there were no teachings or laws,\nThis custom arose.\n\nWhen the Great Dao declined, there were benevolence and righteousness;\nThe Great Dao did not decline to avoid benevolence and righteousness,\nBut because benevolence and righteousness were established,\nThe Great Dao had no choice but to decline—\nFor it was the age of abandoning the root to exalt the branches.\n\nWhen wisdom arose, great deceit followed;\nWisdom did not arise to foster great deceit,\nBut great deceit could not help but arise—\nBecause it relied on traces to take form.\n\nWhen the six kinsfolk were not harmonious, filial piety and kindness emerged;\nOn days when fathers were kind and sons filial,\nWould there be the fame of Zeng Shen?\nWhen states were chaotic and corrupt, loyal ministers arose.\nIn times when rulers were virtuous and ministers upright,\nWhere would the resolve of Bi Gan come from?\n\nTo abandon the sage and discard wisdom,\nThe people’s benefits increase a hundredfold;\nTo abandon the sage and discard wisdom\nIs to have no laws or decrees.\nWith no laws or decrees,\nThe people need not fear transgression.\nWhen the people fear no transgression,\nThey act freely in life—\nCompared to the time of Han Xin’s calculations,\nTheir gains are not merely a hundredfold.\n\nTo abandon benevolence and discard righteousness,\nThe people return to natural filial piety and kindness;\nTo abandon the artificial benevolence and righteousness,\nThe world does not uphold the unattainable laws—\nAll return to natural filial piety and kindness.\n\nTo abandon cleverness and discard profit,\nThieves and robbers vanish.\nTo abandon extraordinary cleverness,\nThen profit is balanced.\nWhen profit is balanced,\nThen the people each have enough.\nWhen the people each have enough,\nWho would become thieves and robbers?\n\nThese three [principles] are insufficient for cultivation,\nSo four more are added.\n*Seeing* the unadorned and discarding stains—\nEmbracing simplicity, guarding the root—\nFewer desires, forgetting self—\nFew desires.\nLosing the paired—\nDiscarding artificial distinctions.\n\nTo abandon learning and have no worries.\nIf one studies worldly affairs,\nEvery action brings regret and hesitation—\nThus, there is worry.\n*\"Yes\"*

me forgotten.\n\nI am the heart of the foolish—\nNo, it is not.\nPure and unadorned—\nThe simple and unrefined have not yet scattered—\nThus, it is called *pure*.\nThe vulgar are sharp and discerning,\nExhibiting rigid friendships.\nI alone am muddled—\nAs if lacking ability.\nThe vulgar are bright and clear,\nBoasting knowledge.\nI alone seem dim—\nAs if hiding the essence.\nVast as the sea, tranquil and solitary—\nLike a hollow boat drifting on the great waters,\nNever stopping or anchoring.\n\nThe multitude all have purpose—\nThus, they are not at ease.\nI alone seem dull and crude—\nI alone do not know of worldly affairs,\nMy stupidity like that of the border folk.\n\nI alone differ from others—\nIn form, like the crowd;\nIn heart, wandering beyond things.\n\nYet I value nourishment from the Mother.\nThe Mother is the Dao.\nNourishment is sustenance.\nWhat makes me differ from others\nIs that I seek sustenance from the Dao.\nThe Dao, because I can abandon worldly learning,\nOften nourishes me with the original harmony and subtle qi.\n\nThe vast virtue’s capacity—\nOnly the Dao follows it.\n*Vast* means extreme.\n*Capacity* means reception.\n*Follows* means to conform.\nThose with virtue,\nTheir hearts pure and empty,\nOnly receive the supreme Dao\nAnd follow it in action.\n\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nIs only vague and indistinct.\nThe Dao, though vague and indistinct, is not without form—\n*Vague* means absence.\n*Indistinct* means presence.\n*Within* refers to the heart.\n*Form* means the boundless form.\nIf the heart is vague—\nWithout things—\nYet becomes indistinct—\nWith desires—\nThen the Dao transforms into boundless form.\n\nIf the heart is indistinct—\nWith desires—\nYet returns to vague—\nWithout desires—\nThen the Dao transforms back

**flourish**,\nYet it **does not refuse**—\nWhen **nurturing all things** is complete,\nIt **does not claim ownership**.\nIt **loves and nourishes** all **things** yet **does not rule** them.\nTo

do not see its trace—\nThen they call it *not* **virtue/power**.\n\nThus, it is indeed **virtue/power**:\nThings do not alter their **Uncarved Block**—\nOnly then does one know it as **virtue/power**.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the Lowest **Dao/Way** does not abandon **virtue/power**,\nAdmiring the beauty of former kings,\nReverently guarding it without decline.\nThus, it is *not* **virtue/power**.\n\nWhen the nature of things slightly shifts,\nOne knows it as *not* **virtue/power**.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the Highest **Dao/Way** acts without action yet nothing is left undone,\nDoes without doing yet achieves.\nThe **virtue/power** of the Lowest **Dao/Way** acts with doing yet leaves nothing undone,\nDoes with doing yet achieves.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the Highest Benevolence\nBegins by transforming **Dao/Way** into benevolence,\nYet nothing is left undone—\nThough it acts, its mind remains undisturbed.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the Highest Righteousness\nBegins by transforming **Dao/Way** into righteousness,\nYet leaves nothing undone—\nFocusing solely on judgment and restraint.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the Highest Propriety\nBegins by transforming **Dao/Way** into propriety,\nYet none respond—\nThen they roll up their sleeves and force it upon them.\nGifts and replies are misplaced,\nThus arises this anger.\nHence, **virtue/power** is lost before **Dao/Way** is lost—\nThe Highest **Dao/Way** aligns with **Dao/Way**, hence the saying *loses **Dao/Way***.\nThe **virtue/power** of the Lowest **Dao/Way** follows next,\nThis is why there is **virtue/power**, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety.\nHaving lost the Highest **virtue/power**,\nThe Lowest **virtue/power** takes its place.\n\n**Virtue/power** is lost before benevolence—\nThe Lowest **virtue/power** has its flaws,\nThus teachings of benevolence arise.\nBenevolence is lost before righteousness—\nTeachings of benevolence decline,\nThus righteousness prevails.\nRighteousness is lost before propriety—\nRight and wrong, fitting and improper,\nAlready fading in time,\nBow and kneel, jade and silk,\nFlourish in the world.\nFor propriety is but the thinnest veneer of loyalty and trust,\nAnd the beginning of chaos.\nChaos is when rulers are not rulers,\nSubjects are not subjects,\nFathers are not fathers,\nSons are not sons.\nLoyalty and trust are **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**.\nIf propriety is compared to **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,\nIt is indeed decayed and thin.\nYet to save from chaos,\nWhere else would one turn but propriety?\nThose who foresaw this knew that propriety would please the eyes of the people—\nThis is called the *flower of **Dao/Way***.\nIn ancient times, *flower* was written; now *ornament* is used instead.\nYet it is the beginning of foolishness.\nIf it is suitable for the foolish,\nIt is the first sign of extravagance.\nThus, a true **man of **Dao/Way****—\nA **man of **Dao/Way**** is one of strong character.\nThe strong character of a **man of **Dao/Way****\nMust be square and upright, not yielding to superficial trends,\nHence the *Changyan* says:\n*A true **man of **Dao/Way****, must practice **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,\nNot indulge in superficial propriety.*\nDwelling in its depth, not in its shallowness,\nHe must commit himself to **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**,\nNot place himself in decayed thinness.\nResiding in substance, not in ornament—\nSubstance like the fruit of grass and trees,\nFilling the stomach of men,\nThus it is dwelt upon.\nOrnament like the flowers of grass and trees,\nMerely pleasing to the eye,\nThus it is not dwelt upon.\nHence, he discards that and takes this—\nDiscarding ornament, taking substance.\nThe *ancient ones who attained **Oneness*** are found in the lower text.\n\nHeaven attains **Oneness** and finds clarity,\nEarth attains **Oneness** and finds tranquility,\nThe valleys attain **Oneness** and fill,\nThe **spirit** attains **Oneness** and becomes luminous,\nAll things attain **Oneness** and live,\nNoble kings attain **Oneness** to rule the world with rectitude.\nFrom Heaven and Earth descending to noble kings,\nWhat enables them to be clear and tranquil,\nIs attaining **Oneness** from **Dao/Way**,\nHence the noble kings rectify themselves to rectify the people,\nThus the world is ruled with rectitude.\n*Rectitude* means *correctness*.\nTheir attainment is as follows:\nHaving known **Dao/Way**,\nTheir attainment is thus—\nHow could they lose it?\n\nHeaven without clarity would fear collapse,\nEarth without tranquility would fear upheaval,\nThe valleys without fullness would fear exhaustion,\nThe **spirit** without luminosity would fear cessation,\nAll things without life would fear annihilation,\nNoble kings without nobility would fear decline.\n*Cessation* means *overturned*.\nIf one attains it yet does not guard it,\nThus arise these calamities.\n\nHence, nobility takes humility as its foundation,\nKings are noble, the people are humble,\nKings take the people as their foundation,\nThus there are people, there are kings.\nHighness takes lowliness as its base.\nA mountain nine *zhang* high,\nA single basketful as its base—\nIf the base is not firm,\nThe mountain will topple.\nTo preserve nobility,\nNot resting securely upon the people,\nThen the people scatter and the kings decline.\nThus, noble kings call themselves *lonely, childless, without grain*—\nIs this not taking humility as their foundation?\nNo, it is not.\n*Lonely* means *child without father*,\n*Childless* means *woman without husband*,\n*Without grain* means *life without sustenance*.\nThese three are what men detest,\nYet noble kings claim them—\nIs this not taking humility as their foundation?\nNo, it is not—\nIt is saying that correctness is taking humility as the foundation.\n\nHence, when attaining the **Dao/Way** of a chariot,\nOne seeks the **Dao/Way** of a chariot—\nOnly the wheels and axles and all the materials are obtained.\nThen, when attaining the **Dao/Way** of a king,\nOne seeks the **Dao/Way** of a king—\nOnly the ministers and the common people are obtained.\nIf one scatters the materials,\nThere will be no day of making a chariot;\nIf one does not rest securely upon the people,\nHow could there be a time for ruling as a king?\n\nDo not desire to be smooth and polished like jade,\nNor rough and unrefined like stone.\n*Smooth and polished* is the appearance of nobility,\n*Rough and unrefined* is the appearance of humility.\nThough jade is noble,\nIt grows from stone;\nThough kings are exalted,\nThey depend upon the people.\nThus, not desiring to be like jade,\nDesiring to be like stone,\nIs to cherish the foundation.\n*Reversion* is the movement of **Dao/Way**,\n**Dao/Way**’s essence is stillness—\nMovement is reversion,\nThe reason for reversion is the rigid nature of things,\nHence setting forth the rigid to meet it,\nAlso hoping to reverse its stillness.\n\nSoftness is the application of **Dao/Way**.\nThe soft and weak are the constant use of **Dao/Way**.\nAll things know this,\nYet it is made clear again—\nFor fear that, due to the meaning of *setting forth the rigid*,\nOne would say that the application of **Dao/Way** is naturally so.\n\nAll things under Heaven are born from *having*,\nAll things are born from the forms of Heaven and Earth.\n*Having* is born from *non-having*.\nThat is, the forms of Heaven and Earth are born from **Dao/Way**.\n**Dao/Way** is *non-having*.\n\nThe Superior **man of **Dao/Way**** hears **Dao/Way**,\nDiligently practices it;\nHearing it and understanding,\nHe diligently practices and returns to the foundation.\n\nThe Middle **man of **Dao/Way**** hears **Dao/Way**,\nAs if it exists, as if it does not;\nHearing it and doubting,\nIt is still teachable—\nTo make him know **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe Inferior **man of **Dao/Way**** hears **Dao/Way**,\nAnd laughs greatly—\nHearing it and being confused,\nThus he laughs greatly,\nThen one cannot make him white as snow.»",

      "translated_text": "The **Dao/Way** is not to be taken lightly—\nFor when it enters the ears of the Inferior **man of Dao/Way** as mere sound,\nIt is not worthy of esteem.\n\nLet me establish this teaching:\n*\"Establish\"* means to clarify.\nClarify the doubts of the Middle and Inferior **men of Dao/Way**,\nWhy they laugh in derision.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is bright yet hidden in practice,\nIlluminated in deed yet concealed in application.\nAdvancing the **Dao/Way** seems like retreat—\nWithin, diligent; without, appearing idle.\nMaking the **Dao/Way** plain seems like disorder—\nLike uneven silk, rough to the touch.\nTreading the level ground as if on perilous heights.\n**Virtue/power** most exalted resembles a valley—\nWithout contrivance, yet responsive in all things.\nGreat whiteness seems like shame—\nPure in nature, yet stained in appearance.\nAmple **virtue/power** appears insufficient—\nThe **Dao/Way** does not manifest in form.\nEstablished **virtue/power** seems like theft—\nTalent concealed, not displayed.\nTrue substance seems corrupted—\nThe most absolute becomes like excess.\nThe greatest square has no corners—\nNo edges or valleys are visible.\nGreat vessels take long to form—\nNot sought daily and obtained.\nGreat music is without sound—\n*\"Hesitant\"* means *nonexistent*.\nWithout sound, yet joyous.\nGreat images are formless—\nThe form of the formless.\n\nFrom *\"Establish this teaching\"* onward,\nAll speak of the **Dao/Way** hidden in the nameless.\nThus, the Superior **man of Dao/Way** penetrates and practices with diligence,\nThe Middle **man of Dao/Way** doubts and hesitates,\nThe Inferior **man of Dao/Way** is confused and laughs—\nNow you know the reason.\n\nOnly the **Dao/Way** is good at lending and completing.\nThe **Dao/Way** does not discriminate among the three **men of Dao/Way**,\nBut uniformly lends its harmonizing *qi*—\nAll things grow and are completed.\nYet those who practice diligently alone return to harmony with the **Dao/Way**,\nWhile those who doubt and laugh both perish in the original *qi*.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** generates *Oneness*—\nThat is, it responds to stimuli and generates *One qi*.\n*One* generates *Two*—\n*One* first generates *yin qi*,\n*Two* first generates *yang qi*.\n*Two* generates *Three*—\n*Three* is when *yin* and *yang* interact and generate harmonizing *qi*.\n*Three* generates all things—\nHarmonizing *qi* gathers and gives birth to all things.\nAll things carry *yin* externally and embrace *yang* internally,\nTheir clashing *qi* harmonizes.\nGenerally, the outer skin and texture are called *\"carrying yin.\"*\nSkin and texture are the work of *yin qi*.\nThe marrow and bones, filled within, are called *\"embracing yang.\"*\nBone structure is the work of *yang qi*.\nThe **Dao/Way**’s *qi* is soft and weak,\nPenetrating and harmonizing between them.\n\nWhat people detest are the *Three Loneliness*—\nThe solitary, the widowed, the childless—\nYet kings and nobles take them as titles.\nThe kings and nobles’ harmonizing *qi* is soft and weak,\nThe root of all things,\nThus they can use what is unlucky as their title,\nAnd so become rulers of the world.\nThus, some things are diminished yet benefit—\nCalling it unlucky is truly self-diminishment,\nFor how could anything not submit?\nOr benefit yet be diminished—\nThose who rely on their noble status\nAre themselves the benefactors,\nYet the people’s hearts turn away—\nWhat else but loss could it be?\n\nWhat people teach is also my teaching.\nIf one desires to establish teaching for others,\nThey must also teach with the principle of softness and weakness,\nThen those who embrace it will all return to the city of nature and life.\n\nThe strong and violent do not meet a good end.\nWhen a ruler is strong and tyrannical,\nHis ministers’ loyalty wanes, and ruin is imminent.\nWhen a person is strong and violent,\nThey are overthrown by the many—\nTheir downfall is inevitable.\nI will make this my teaching’s foundation.\n*\"Foundation\"* means what comes first.\nI make the principle of softness and weakness\nThe first teaching for the people.\n\nThe most soft under Heaven\nOvercomes the most hard under Heaven.\nFor harmonizing *qi* is the most soft thing under Heaven.\nIf one rides it,\nIt transforms into the most hard thing under Heaven.\nThere is nothing that enters the unbroken—\nIf one wishes to restore harmonizing *qi* to its softness,\nSimply abandon the intent to ride it,\nClarify the mind that harmonizing *qi* naturally enters the unbroken,\nAnd it transforms into the most soft thing.\n\nThus I know the benefits of *wuwei*.\nLaozi said:\n*\"I see those who ride *wuwei*—\nThey can make harmonizing *qi* dwell eternally in the heart,\nSoft and weak, yet long-lived—\nThus I know *wuwei* benefits people.\"*\n\nThe teaching of silence,\nThe benefits of *wuwei*—\nFew under Heaven can attain them.\nTo not speak to others,\nTo practice *wuwei* oneself—\nFew under Heaven can do this.\n\nWhich is closer: name or body?\nName can be discarded, but body cannot—\nThen which is more distant?\nWhich is more abundant: body or wealth?\nWealth lost can be sought, but life lost cannot be regained—\nThen which is scarcer?\nWhich is more harmful: gain or loss?\nGain leads to losing the body,\nLoss preserves the true self—\nThen which is truly advantageous?\n\nThus excessive love brings great expenditure—\nDesire beyond measure means great loss.\nHoarding leads to great ruin.\nAccumulating without dispersing,\nNineteen out of twenty will die.\nKnowing sufficiency brings no disgrace—\nSufficiency in the heart brings constant honor.\nKnowing when to stop brings no peril—\nStopping at one’s measure brings constant peace.\nThis is how one endures long.\n\nGreat completion resembles deficiency—\nThose with full **virtue/power** appear lacking.\nTheir use is unexhausted.\nTheir response to things is boundless.\n\nGreat fullness resembles emptiness—\nThose internally real appear externally void.\nTheir use is inexhaustible.\nEven in aiding the multitude, they are never depleted.\n\nGreat straightness resembles bending—\nThey endure filth without complaint.\nGreat skill resembles clumsiness—\nThey do not boast of their abilities.\nGreat eloquence resembles stammering—\nSeeming unable to speak.\n\nThe restless overcomes the cold—\nThings at their extreme reverse—\nThus at the summer solstice, *yin* begins to arise within it.\nThe tranquil overcomes the heat—\nMisfortune at its peak becomes fortune—\nThus at the winter solstice, *yang* begins to arise within it.\n\nCalmness and stillness are the norm for the world.\n*\"Norm\"* means the balance between restlessness and tranquility—\nThus the second and eighth months.\nHence, from *\"Great completion\"* onward to *\"Great eloquence,\"*\nAll conform to the balance between restlessness and tranquility,\nAttaining the world’s norm.\n\nWhen the world follows the **Dao/Way**,\nWarhorses are driven back to manure fields.\nA **Dao/Way**-governed ruler succeeds a mediocre one,\nAnd must rectify chaos and restore order,\nAbandoning arms and cultivating culture—\nThus the warhorses formerly used in conquest\nAre now unused and returned to their homes\nTo till the fields.\n\nWhen the world lacks the **Dao/Way**,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\nA ruler without the **Dao/Way** follows a peaceful era,\nRelying on abundant treasuries,\nAnd grows fond of warfare,\nSeizing others’ lands—\nThus soldiers never dismount,\nEver stationed at the borders.",

remains whole;\ndisturb it, and it spoils.\n\nA skilled ruler of the people lets them find their own way, and they are at peace;\ndisturb them, and they fall into chaos.\n\nWhen the Dao reigns over the world,\nits spirits lose their power.\n\nWhere the Dao’s transformation reaches,\nthe people suffer no calamities—\nthus, its spirits seem without power.\n\nIt is not that the spirits lack power,\nbut that their power does not harm the people.\nThe spirits truly possess power,\nand their power does not damage things.\n\nNor is it that their power does not harm the people—\nthe Sage also does not harm the people.\n\nThe Sage loves the people as a newborn child,\nand the spirits likewise bring them blessings.\n\nThe living and the unseen both find their rightful place,\nunhindered—\nthus, virtue returns in harmony.\n\nThe ruler lacks no offerings to the spirits,\nfor the spirits can confer blessings upon him—\nthus, it is said that his virtue returns in harmony.\n\nA great state is the **lowly stream** (*xiàliú*), the gathering place of the world.\nIf it practices humility with moderation,\nwho would dare not submit?\nThus, states great and small come to pay homage.\n\nThe world’s gathering place is **feminine** (*pǔ*), ever victorious over the **masculine** (*mǔ*) through stillness.\nThe reason why the world’s states come to pay homage\nis that they can dwell in the lowly stream.\n\nAs the feminine prevails over the masculine,\nthis is spoken of in terms of stillness and lowliness—\nfor none seek the masculine when they desire the feminine.\n\nStillness is lowliness.\nThus, the masculine seeks it.\n\nTherefore, a great state that humbles itself beneath smaller states\nwill take them;\na great state that can humble itself\nwill find smaller states sincerely submitting.\n\nA small state that humbles itself beneath a great state\nwill be taken by it;\na small state that can humble itself\nwill be received with courtesy by the great.\n\nThus, sometimes one humbles to take,\nsometimes one humbles and is taken—\nall have their reasons.\n\nA great state seeks only to **encompass and nourish** (*jiānxù*) others;\nthe reason it humbles itself\nis only to encompass and nourish smaller states,\nmaking them tributaries,\nand expand its lands.\n\nA small state seeks only to **enter and serve** (*rùshì*) others.\nThe reason it humbles itself\nis to enter and serve a great state,\nso that other kingdoms dare not rise in arms against it.\n\nBoth achieve their desires,\nfulfilling their ambitions—\nthus, the great should humble itself.\n\nA warning against the great\nis that it might rely on strength rather than practice humility.\n\nThe Dao is the **ultimate mystery** (*ào*) of all things—\nthe Dao, among all things, is the deepest and most mysterious,\nable to **be the foundation** (*gēnpǐn*) for the myriad creatures.\n\nThe treasure of the virtuous person,\nthe Dao of the virtuous person,\nis that by **cultivating the self** (*xiūshēn*), one may attain **long life** (*chángshēng*).\nThus, it is called a treasure.\n\nThe refuge of the unvirtuous person.\nThe unvirtuous person—\nthis refers to the **lowly scholar** (*xiàshì*)—\nhas never sought the Dao.\nWhen disaster strikes,\nthey cling to it as a desperate hope for protection.\n\nSweet words can be **bartered** (*shì*).\nIn trade,\nthose who can **delight in their speech** (*gān cí*)\nfind easy assembly when they go forth,\neasy acquisition when they seek.\n\nNoble conduct can **elevate others** (*jiārén*).\nThose whose deeds are exalted\ncan first **teach and guide** (*jiào jiā*) others.\n\nWhat is there to **abandon** (*qì*) in the unvirtuous?\nNo one is without virtue—\nonly that their transformation has not yet reached its fullness.\n\nThus, when establishing the **Son of Heaven** (*Tiānzǐ*) and appointing the **Three Exalted Ministers** (*sāngōng*),\nthe Son of Heaven is the **master of the myriad people** (*wànmín zhī zhǔ*).\nHe wishes to entrust them with his Dao,\nso that they may transform the unvirtuous—\nyet fears they might neglect his Dao.\nThus, he further appoints the Three Exalted Ministers to assist him.\n\nEven with a **jewel-embossed tablet** (*gǒngbì*) and **fine steeds** (*liángmǎ*) presented before the carriage,\nit is not as good as **simply presenting this Dao** (*zuòjìn zhī dào*).\n\nThe Three Exalted Ministers may offer a jewel-embossed tablet\nand fine steeds before the carriage,\nbut this is merely the duty of loyal ministers.\nYet it is not as good as\n**simply presenting this profound and mysterious Dao to the ruler** (*zuòjìn zhī shēn’ào zhī dào*)\nto gather the **abundant and harmonious transformations** (*yōngxī zhī huà*).\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this in such

      "translated_text": "「The rivers and seas are able to be the sovereign of all the valleys because they excel in yielding.\nThus, they are able to be the sovereign of all the valleys.\n*Sovereign* (王者) means *to go forth* (往也).\nThe rivers and seas excel in dwelling beneath the myriad streams,\nand thus all the valleys converge and gather without fail.\nTherefore, the sage is one who can emulate the rivers and seas.\n\nTo rise above others, one must first yield in speech;\nTo dwell above others, one must first yield in speech to them.\nTo surpass others, one must first place oneself behind them;\nTo dwell before others, one must retreat one’s own person behind them.\n\nThus, though in a position above, people do not feel burdened,\nand all willingly revere and uphold him—\nyet he is still considered light.\nThough at the forefront, people are not harmed,\nand all gladly follow without resentment or injury.\nThus, he delights in promoting and never tires.\n\nThis is the power of *humility*.\nBecause he does not contend, none under heaven can contend with him.\nI use *humility* (谦德) to transform the people below,\nand they, transformed, all become *retreat and yield* (退让).\n\nAll under heaven say, “His Dao is vast, yet he seems unworthy.”\nAll under heaven say, “His Dao is vast, yet he seems unvirtuous.”\nOnly because it is vast does it seem unworthy.\nI tell them: the great person’s folly is beyond reach.\nIf *worthy* (肖) were long-lasting, how trifling it would be!\nIf *virtue* (贤) were to let others attain it,\nthis would be the most trifling of all under heaven for long.\n\nI possess three treasures—\nthough I am unworthy, I have three practices,\nwhich can be called the most precious of *cultivating the self and governing the state*.\n*Treasure* (宝) and *hold* (持).\nIf people regard them as treasures and hold them without abandon,\nthen where can one go without benefit?\nThe first is *compassion* (慈), which is *benevolence* (仁).\nThe second is *frugality* (俭), which is *restraint* (约).\nThe third is *not daring to be first under heaven*—\ndwelling behind all actions.\n\n*Compassion* (慈) thus enables *courage* (勇);\n*courage* to *rescue and aid* (济物).\n*Frugality* (俭) thus enables *broadness* (广);\n*restraint* (节用) thus yields this abundance.\nNot daring to be first under heaven,\nthus one achieves *longevity* (长).\n*Self-effacement* (自下) leads to completion,\nand *ascending to greatness* (升高) fulfills achievements—\nthus one attains to be the sovereign of all under heaven.\n*Emperor Yao* (尧) was the sovereign of the Nine Regions—this is the same.\n\nNow, if one abandons *compassion* and yet has *courage*,\n*courage* without *benevolence* will harm others.\nIf one abandons *frugality* and yet seeks *broadness*,\n*excess* without restraint will surely appear.\nIf one abandons *yielding* and yet seeks to be first,\n*placing oneself before others* (先己) while neglecting them,\npeople will surely harbor resentment.\n*Death* (死矣).\nIf these three practices are missing even one,\n*death* (死矣) will follow—\nhow much more so if none are practiced at all?\n\n*Compassion* (慈): when waging war, it ensures victory;\nwhen defending, it ensures stability.\nThe general who can use *compassion* to nurture and care for his soldiers,\nthe soldiers’ hearts will not waver—\nthus, when waging war, he will be victorious,\nand when defending, he will be steadfast.\nHeaven will aid him,\nwith *compassion* as his shield.\n*Compassion* moves Heaven,\nand Heaven thus aids and rescues,\nfor the general can use *compassion* as his shield for the soldiers.\n\nThe skilled general is not fierce,\nfor he relies on *Dao* rather than force.\nThose who delight in battle are not angry,\nfor they rely on *strategy* rather than rage.\nThe skilled victor does not contend,\nfor he relies on *virtue* rather than strife.\nThe skilled user of men places himself below them,\nfor he relies on *humility* rather than power.\n\nThis is called the *virtue of non-contention*,\nthis is called the *power of using men*,\nthis is called *harmonizing with Heaven*—\nthe ultimate of the ancients.\nThe four virtues above,\nif one can practice them, none will fail to respond.\nThus, one attains to *align with Heaven’s Way*—\nthe ultimate attainment of the ancients.\n\nOn waging war, there is a saying:\n*Follow the ruler’s inclinations and advance one’s Dao*.\nThe saying on waging war is in the following passage.\n\nI do not dare to be the *master of the master* (主主),\nfirst stirring others to action.\nInstead, I am the *guest* (客),\nand the *guest* harmonizes without singing lead.\nI do not dare to advance even an inch without right,\nbut retreat a foot.\nI defend myself and await changes.\n\nThis is called *action without action*—\nthe enemy is my border,\nand I advance only to stop them—\nnot harboring intentions of slaughter or conquest.\n*Repelling without arms*—\nthere is no anger that does not repel,\nthus it seems as though one has no arms.\n*Yet there is no enemy*—\nnot contending for victory,\nthus one does not provoke battle.\n*Grasping without weapons*—\nrelying on *virtue* rather than force.\n\nNo greater calamity than *lightly regarding the enemy*—\nthe *guest’s* way has no greater beginning than this.\nTo lightly regard the enemy risks losing my treasures.\n*Treasure* (宝) is the *self* (身).\nIf one lightly regards the enemy and presses deep,\nthere will be none who do not carry corpses away.\nThus, when armies clash in battle,\nthe one whose soldiers are filled with *compassion* will win.\nTwo states raise their armies,\nthe *guest* and *host* forces are evenly matched—\nwhen they meet in battle and achieve victory,\nthe one whose *compassion* is deeply rooted among his soldiers will triumph.\n\nMy words are very easy to know,\nvery easy to practice.\nSaying my words are *non-action*,\nthey are easy to know.\nIf one wishes to practice them,\nwhat difficulty could there be?\n\nYet none under heaven can know them,\nnone can practice them.\nAll under heaven are in turmoil,\nall following *action* (有为).\n*Action* and *non-action* are opposed,\nand thus none can practice them.\n\nWords have a *root* (宗),\naffairs have a *lord* (君).\n*Dao* is the *root*,\n*virtue* is the *lord*.\nOnly because of *ignorance* (无知),\nthey do not know me.\n*Ignorance* means their *perception* (识) does not reach *principle* (理).\n\nIf people cannot know my profound words,\nor practice my *non-action*,\nthen how can *virtue and power* reach their utmost?\n\nFew know me,\nfor the world has few who can know my *virtue and power*.\nThus, I am precious.\nThose who know me and follow my example\nare without compare in their preciousness.\n\nTherefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.\nWithin, he holds the supreme treasure,\nwithout, he lacks ostentatious display—\nthus, none under heaven can know him.\n\n*Knowing the unknowable*—\nthis is *superior* (上).\n*Perceiving all things*—\nthough one claims to know nothing,\nthis is true knowledge—\nis it not *superior*?\n\n*Not knowing the knowable*—\nthis is *illness* (病).\nStanding before a wall,\nknowing nothing yet claiming to know all—\nthis is a deluded person,\nis it not *illness*?\n\nOnly because one *diseases illness*,\ndoes one not fall ill.\nThe true knower\nis able to regard *false knowledge* as illness and disease it,\nand thus true knowledge is not ill,\nwhile false knowledge is diseased.\n\nThe sage does not fall ill,\nfor he diseases illness.\nIf he were to fall ill himself,\nhe would not be able to disease others.\n\n---\n*(Note: This translation follows the conventions of
