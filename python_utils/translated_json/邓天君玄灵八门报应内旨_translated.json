One scroll.\nSource: *The Orthodox Daoist Canon* (正统道藏), First Canon (正一部).\n\n**Lord Deng Tianjun’s Inner Essentials of the Mysterious Eight Gates**\nThe Celestial Lord (天君) personally inscribed these Essentials of the Mysterious Eight Gates and the Secret Formula of the Sixty *Jiazi* (甲子) on the Palm.\n\nIts essence is the formula for the Nine Palaces (九宫) and the Eight Gates (八门) to determine daily retributions (直日報應). The method of judgment differs from the *Eight Gates Drum Song* (打門槌歌) of the Divine Old Master Xu (徐神翁) and the *Ghost’s Knocks at the Gate* (鬼敲門) method; it is not based on candle divination (占灯) or ritual readings (占课).\n\nThose who obtain this formula should not cling rigidly to its sequence but recite and memorize it well. Its auspicious or inauspicious meanings will be revealed by the Dao’s divine guidance (神告), infallible in every trial.\n\n**First, refine the Two Attendants (二使) within the Dipper (斗).**\nThen, draw the true forms of the Two Attendants and venerate them at dawn and dusk (晨夕寅奉).\n\n**The Double-Flying Seven-Star Constraints (双飞七星罡):**\nExhale (吹) and inhale (呵) the *Kan* (坎) and *Li* (離) energies in union.\n**The Infant and Maiden Formation (婴儿姹女结):**\nThe Two Attendants bathe in the *Hua Pool* (華池).\n\n**Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth (金木水火土):**\nKnow their comings and goings, their births and deaths (去來知生死).\n**Seize the Four Celestial Gates (四天門),**\nNo need to verify their efficacy (不問驗不驗).\n**The Dipper’s Inner Vision (斗中内景):**\nSilently recite the *Long Life Formula* (長生).\n\n**The Secret Formula for Judging Auspiciousness in Poetry**\n*\"For mortals with ailments, examine their roots (勘其因),*\nSilently recite the Eight Gates and Four Principles (四理) to reveal their truth (真).\n*This oral transmission of the Long Life Formula (長生诀) requires no external means to seek its truth (不须物外更求真).\"*\n\n**The Auspicious Eight Gates Formula for Direct Daily Retribution (陽日八門默點直日報應詩)**\n*\"If the Gate of Auspiciousness (休門) is encountered, dig the soil (掘土) promptly,*\n*Then early determine the causes of joy and sorrow (悲喜定元因).*\n*Even Bian Que (扁鹊) himself may judge it as death,*\n*But Master Xu’s words alone reveal its true essence (親授真).\"*\n\n**The Inauspicious Eight Gates Formula for Direct Daily Retribution (陰日八門默點直日報應詩)**\n*\"If the Gate of Alarm (驚門) appears, first cross the inquiry (過詢),*\n*Danger looms for three days—its cause is fixed (定元因).*\n*Beyond this, if the Gate of Auspiciousness (景門) is passed, Master Xu will safeguard (徐公保),*\n*Yet neither Lu Yi (卢医) nor Bian Que (扁鹊) can cross its true boundary (不度真).\"*\n\n**The *Jiazi* (甲子) Formula for Auspiciousness (跏趺口诀)**\n*\"Sit in the morning, stand in the evening, and sit again at midnight (子).*\n**Double-Flying Seven-Star Constraints (双飞七星罡):**\nExhale (吹) and inhale (呵) the *Kan* (坎) and *Li* (離) energies in union.\n**The Infant and Maiden Formation (婴儿姹女结):**\nThe Seven Stars (七星) bathe in the *Hua Pool* (華池) for seventy-seven days.\n\n*Open the gates in the seventh and eighth months (七月、八月).*\n*Auspiciousness governs the ninth and tenth months (休九月、十月).*\n*Life thrives in the eleventh month (生十一月).*\n*Alarm dominates the fifth and sixth months (驚五月、六月居中).*\n*Decay belongs to the twelfth month (傷十二月).*\n*Death is fixed in the third month’s *Chen* (辰) and fourth month’s *Si* (巳) (死三月辰、四月巳).*\n*The Gate of Auspiciousness (景門) passes through the second month’s *Mao* (卯).*\n*Du (杜) governs the first month’s *Yin* (寅).\"*\n\n**The Right Eight Gates Formula for Determining Auspiciousness by Month (逐月所值以取吉凶例)**\n*\"The monthly correspondences are taken thus for auspicious or inauspicious signs:*\n*In the first month, reverse the Du (杜) gate to ascend (上行).*\n*The Gate of Auspiciousness (景門) passes through the second month’s decan (旬).*\n*Chen (辰) and Si (巳) cross the fourth month’s node (節).*\n*The Gate of Alarm (驚門) passes through the sixth month’s midpoint (中).*\n*The Gate of Opening (開門) determines joy in the seventh month (七月喜),*\n*Memorize firmly: Auspiciousness ascends in the ninth month (九十牢記休上行).*\n*The Gate of Life (生門) again brings joy when the *Zi* (子) month appears (子月現).*\n*The Gate of Decay (傷門) determines the master’s fate in the passing year (過残年).\"*\n\n**The Ritual Process**\nThe master enters a state of tranquility (靖), reciting the *Pure Mouth Incantation* (念净口咒), the *Pure Heart Incantation* (净心咒), the *Pure Body Incantation* (净身咒), and the *Pure Heaven and Earth Incantation* (净天地咒). After refining impurities (炼秽), the *qi* is retained within (存内), the *Yan Sheng Scripture* (延生经) is recited in transformation (变诵), and the master sits in *Dali* (跏趺) posture, striking teeth twenty-four times (叩齿二十四通), and harmonizing breath (交气).\n\n*\"Greed for vast wealth (贪巨禄) and corruption in virtue (文廉武破) [are judged],*\n*[Blank] [Blank] [Blank] [Blank] [Blank] [Blank] [Blank].\"*\n\n**The Dipper (斗) Ritual**\nEach participant (讳各交) recites seven times (七遍), swallowing saliva nine times (咽液九过), retaining the *qi* within oneself as the True Person of one’s natal command (本命真人状).\n\n**The Master’s Silent Incantation (師默诵咒曰):**\n*\"The Left Azure Dragon (左青龙), Master Meng (孟章), swiftly emerges from my left,*\n*Exhale the liver *qi* (嘘肝气) once into the left

me.*\n*Imagine the Four Beasts (四兽) guarding the exhalation-inhalation method (护呵法),*\n*Retain the *qi* within the body, blowing it into both eyes (身吹存两目),*\n*Then manifest the light of sun and moon (日月之光),*\n*Called the *Division of Sun and Moon Light* (日月分光).*\n*Next, store the *qi* in the left and right nostrils, inhaling it into the heart,*\n*Forming the True Person (真人) within the Vermilion Palace (绛宫).\"*\n\n**Then recite the Heart Incantation (却念心咒):**\n*\"Heart’s divine spirit (心中神),*\n*Lord Dan Yuan (丹元君),*\n*Named Huang Ting (黄庭),*\n*Called Hua Yin (字华婴),*\n*Two inches in length

Chariot,*\n*Pass through the Yellow Path’s *gāngfēng* winds,*\n*Arrive at the Vermilion Palace,*\n*Disembark, and reintegrate the attendants into the body.*\n*Swallow saliva, strike the teeth,*\n*Then

One scroll.\nSource: *The Orthodox Daoist Canon* (正统道藏), First Canon (正一部).\n\n**Lord Deng Tianjun’s Inner Essentials of the Mysterious Eight Gates**\nThe Celestial Lord (天君) personally inscribed these Essentials of the Mysterious Eight Gates and the Secret Formula of the Sixty *Jiazi* (甲子) on the Palm.\n\nIts essence is the formula for the Nine Palaces (九宫) and the Eight Gates (八门) to determine daily retributions (直日報應). The method of judgment differs from the *Eight Gates Drum Song* (打門槌歌) of the Divine Old Master Xu (徐神翁) and the *Ghost’s Knocks at the Gate* (鬼敲門) method; it is not based on candle divination (占灯) or ritual readings (占课).\n\nThose who obtain this formula should not cling rigidly to its sequence but recite and memorize it well. Its auspicious or inauspicious meanings will be revealed by the Dao’s divine guidance (神告), infallible in every trial.\n\n**First, refine the Two Attendants (二使) within the Dipper (斗).**\nThen, draw the true forms of the Two Attendants and venerate them at dawn and dusk (晨夕寅奉).\n\n**The Double-Flying Seven-Star Constraints (双飞七星罡):**\nExhale (吹) and inhale (呵) the *Kan* (坎) and *Li* (離) energies in union.\n**The Infant and Maiden Formation (婴儿姹女结):**\nThe Two Attendants bathe in the *Hua Pool* (華池).\n\n**Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth (金木水火土):**\nKnow their comings and goings, their births and deaths (去來知生死).\n**Seize the Four Celestial Gates (四天門),**\nNo need to verify their efficacy (不問驗不驗).\n**The Dipper’s Inner Vision (斗中内景):**\nSilently recite the *Long Life Formula* (長生).\n\n**The Secret Formula for Judging Auspiciousness in Poetry**\n*\"For mortals with ailments, examine their roots (勘其因),*\nSilently recite the Eight Gates and Four Principles (四理) to reveal their truth (真).\n*This oral transmission of the Long Life Formula (長生诀) requires no external means to seek its truth (不须物外更求真).\"*\n\n**The Auspicious Eight Gates Formula for Direct Daily Retribution (陽日八門默點直日報應詩)**\n*\"If the Gate of Auspiciousness (休門) is encountered, dig the soil (掘土) promptly,*\n*Then early determine the causes of joy and sorrow (悲喜定元因).*\n*Even Bian Que (扁鹊) himself may judge it as death,*\n*But Master Xu’s words alone reveal its true essence (親授真).\"*\n\n**The Inauspicious Eight Gates Formula for Direct Daily Retribution (陰日八門默點直日報應詩)**\n*\"If the Gate of Alarm (驚門) appears, first cross the inquiry (過詢),*\n*Danger looms for three days—its cause is fixed (定元因).*\n*Beyond this, if the Gate of Auspiciousness (景門) is passed, Master Xu will safeguard (徐公保),*\n*Yet neither Lu Yi (卢医) nor Bian Que (扁鹊) can cross its true boundary (不度真).\"*\n\n**The *Jiazi* (甲子) Formula for Auspiciousness (跏趺口诀)**\n*\"Sit in the morning, stand in the evening, and sit again at midnight (子).*\n**Double-Flying Seven-Star Constraints (双飞七星罡):**\nExhale (吹) and inhale (呵) the *Kan* (坎) and *Li* (離) energies in union.\n**The Infant and Maiden Formation (婴儿姹女结):**\nThe Seven Stars (七星) bathe in the *Hua Pool* (華池) for seventy-seven days.\n\n*Open the gates in the seventh and eighth months (七月、八月).*\n*Auspiciousness governs the ninth and tenth months (休九月、十月).*\n*Life thrives in the eleventh month (生十一月).*\n*Alarm dominates the fifth and sixth months (驚五月、六月居中).*\n*Decay belongs to the twelfth month (傷十二月).*\n*Death is fixed in the third month’s *Chen* (辰) and fourth month’s *Si* (巳) (死三月辰、四月巳).*\n*The Gate of Auspiciousness (景門) passes through the second month’s *Mao* (卯).*\n*Du (杜) governs the first month’s *Yin* (寅).\"*\n\n**The Right Eight Gates Formula for Determining Auspiciousness by Month (逐月所值以取吉凶例)**\n*\"The monthly correspondences are taken thus for auspicious or inauspicious signs:*\n*In the first month, reverse the Du (杜) gate to ascend (上行).*\n*The Gate of Auspiciousness (景門) passes through the second month’s decan (旬).*\n*Chen (辰) and Si (巳) cross the fourth month’s node (節).*\n*The Gate of Alarm (驚門) passes through the sixth month’s midpoint (中).*\n*The Gate of Opening (開門) determines joy in the seventh month (七月喜),*\n*Memorize firmly: Auspiciousness ascends in the ninth month (九十牢記休上行).*\n*The Gate of Life (生門) again brings joy when the *Zi* (子) month appears (子月現).*\n*The Gate of Decay (傷門) determines the master’s fate in the passing year (過残年).\"*\n\n**The Ritual Process**\nThe master enters a state of tranquility (靖), reciting the *Pure Mouth Incantation* (念净口咒), the *Pure Heart Incantation* (净心咒), the *Pure Body Incantation* (净身咒), and the *Pure Heaven and Earth Incantation* (净天地咒).
