  "full_translation": "*The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Wisdom, Resolute Will, and Penetrating the Subtle*\n\nAt that time, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy abided in stillness within the Primordial Yang Seven-Jewel Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mysterious Capital, his spirit tranquil in the profound void, serene and non-active. Within the Purple Tenuity Palace, inner and outer radiance shone boundlessly; a hundred harmonious treasures incensed the air without burning, their fragrant light intertwining and surging through the empty sky, drifting and flowing, scattering endlessly. The adorned brilliance was distant and rich, soft and cool, its purity and elegance beyond description. The celestial harmony played in myriad forms, all intermingling.\n\nSuddenly, the Heavenly Worthy, without so much as a glance, reflected upon the origins of the myriad beings: though their embryonic endowments were the same, each coalesced from the qi of primordial chaos to form their spirits. The spirit, originally pure and limpid, untainted, once infused into form, became stained by the six emotions. With the first contamination of the six emotions, movement gave rise to defilement—deluded by what they saw, obscured by what they clung to, worldly affairs and conditions arose in succession. Thus they attracted karmic filth, accumulating it life after life, revolving through the Three Realms, adrift and forgetful of return; drifting through the Five Paths, sinking endlessly without awakening. Embracing pain and poison, they remain unaware, their spirits racing in terror, treading only the path of transgression.\n\nMoved by profound compassion, he could not bear it. Recalling the beginning of their endowment, the principle was truly pitiable. He then dispatched an attendant minister to summon the Left Mystery Perfected and the Right Mystery Perfected. In an instant, the two Perfected Ones arrived in person, bowed in reverence, and took their seats in due order. After some time seated in attendance, their casual conversation subsided.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke: \"The reason I have summoned you is precisely to address this. I have just reflected upon the origins of the countless beings—thus it is. Yet this principle may still be saved. You two worthies have already aroused great compassion and great mercy; should you not share in this aspiration?\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones replied: \"The multitudes wallow in suffering, ever within our reach, and we have already done all we could—teaching them in detail, explaining the consequences of sin and merit to the utmost. Yet there remain stubborn, foolish people who persist in disbelief. Even if they briefly believe, their faith fades within days or months, and they relapse into negligence. This, too, is a matter for the Heavenly Worthy’s discernment—what is to be done?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Though they grow negligent, even a moment’s faith is no small merit. You two worthies have already planted this merit; it is fitting to commend them.\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones asked: \"We wonder what method might surely awaken them.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy answered: \"Such people are benighted. If shown broad paths, the texts are too numerous and the affairs too trifling for their understanding. What they cannot grasp breeds only weariness. Now, if we distill the essentials into concise language and present them clearly, it will be different.\"\n\nThereupon, the Two Perfected Ones rose from their seats, bowed to the Heavenly Worthy, and asked: \"What concise essentials might open their awakening?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Return to your seats. I wish to impart to you the *Essential Formula for Concentrating the Mind through Subtle Reflection*. Its essence is simplicity; from simplicity comes awakening—is this not swift?\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones asked: \"Is there a scripture for *Concentrating the Mind through Subtle Reflection*?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"There are no written words.\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones said: \"Such people are like those who dash against walls—utterly deluded. Without written words, how can they awaken?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"Were all scriptures originally written? Are not today’s words also scripture?\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones said: \"We beg to hear them; we shall record them at once.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Suppose there were people—thousands or tens of thousands—who desired treasures. Hearing of their abundance in the sea, they each prepared vessels, some rafts, some ships, hundreds or thousands of them, and set sail upon the great ocean, traveling thousands of miles, near or far. There were hundreds of islands and countless isles, some submerged, where treasures abounded—even limitless seven-jeweled radiance, each light piercing the sky in different hues. Yet among so many sailing companions, when the wind was right for departure, none recognized the light. They set forth blindly, not knowing their direction.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy continued: \"Could these companions obtain treasures?\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones said: \"Without a guide, with no foreknowledge of the way, and unable to recognize the treasure’s light, they would wander in confusion. This journey would be most difficult. They would have to search every place, dig everywhere, and even in the water, expend a hundredfold effort—perhaps then they might succeed.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Those who study the Dao yet lack the *Essential Formula for Concentrating the Mind through Subtle Reflection* are like these people, unable to recognize the treasure’s light yet seeking treasure—how pitiable!\n\n\"Now, suppose among this multitude, one person could recognize the treasure’s light. The radiance pierced the sky, visible from ten thousand miles away, as if seen in the palm of the hand. Though many could not see it, the one who could raised the sail and went first, and all the ships followed, arriving directly at the treasure’s place. They all obtained great quantities of seven-jeweled treasures, loading their vessels to the full and returning to their homeland. The companions then said: ‘Thanks to our guide, we should now repay his kindness.’ Each ship gathered treasures worth billions, offering them in gratitude—was this not joyous?\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones asked: \"What profit is so great?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Those who study the Dao and obtain this *Essential Formula for Concentrating the Mind through Subtle Reflection* are like the one who recognized the treasure’s light.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy continued: \"In ancient and distant kalpas, when the mandate of a Heavenly King expired and the world was to change rulers, whoever obtained the celestial regalia would become the Son of Heaven. A skilled physiognomist saw the regalia’s light upon a mountain. That very night, a great storm raged, and torches could not stand. The light shone in the darkness, yet no one saw it. The master said to the villagers: ‘The celestial regalia of the Son of Heaven lies within this mountain.’ The villagers heard and secretly went, but in the darkness, they could not find it. Those who study without the *Essential Formula for Concentrating the Mind* are like those groping in the dark. When the physiognomist heard that the people could not find the regalia, he went himself and obtained it at once, ascending to the heavenly throne. If one attains this *Essential Formula*, the mind becomes settled, and the quest for the Dao is certain—like that physiognomist who recognized the treasure. Do not lightly disclose it. Those who do shall incur the guardians’ punishment, a sin not easily absolved. Why? Not only is it a slight to the scripture, but to the Dao itself. Let those who receive this teaching be ever vigilant.\"\n\nHearing this, the Two Perfected Ones rejoiced boundlessly, their inner and outer selves in accord, and begged to hear more.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Since I wish to tell you, how could I conceal it? Now, the essential formula: Know that within the Three Realms, the Three Times are all empty. Knowing the Three Times are empty, though you have a self, it too should return to emptiness. Understanding this principle of returning to emptiness, you can forget the self. One who forgets the self—how could they still cling to it? With no attachment to the self, one can abandon all attachments, loving only the Dao. One who loves the Dao—the Dao also loves them. To be loved by the Dao is to return to truth. The *Essential Formula for Concentrating the Mind* is fully contained herein. This is the return of the two halves to one, the return of the original One to truth. With the Dao’s work ascending daily, shall we not be free from care and toil?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy continued: \"The two halves becoming one has five meanings—do you understand?\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones replied: \"We do. Is it not that from the pure and empty *qi*, through the mingling of *yinyun*, half descended, joining with these four halves to become one? Or is it that when this provisional one turns to evil, it summons the natural *qi*, sinking into the Three Wretched Realms?\"\n\n\"Or is it that by doing good, one leaves these four halves to ascend to the Great Void, restoring one’s pure and empty *qi*, reuniting one’s two halves, and dwelling in spontaneity?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"You have grasped it. Now I shall display the *Wheel-Turning Diagram of the Two Halves* in the air before the Left Perfected One below.\"\n\nThe *Diagram of the Two Halves* is as follows:\nIt is also called the *True Contract for Concentrating the Mind and Stabilizing the Will*.\nThe ritual requires:\n- Twenty-four thousand gold coins,\n- Five taels of refined gold,\n- One bolt each of five-colored patterned silk,\n- Five taels of plain silk,\n- One bolt each of five-directional patterned silk,\n- One mirror,\n- One bolt of life-destiny patterned silk (one bolt per year in excess),\n- One pair of gold buttons,\n- And various other items as needed.\n\nWhen transmitting this, the giver must clearly divide it into twelve sections. If the transmission is incomplete, it violates the precepts, and the offense is multiplied fourfold. If the recipient’s ritual offerings are insufficient and their *qi* is weak or deficient, they also incur guilt, equal to the offense of violating the transmission precepts—except for wandering and destitute Daoist priests.\n\nThe disciple So-and-So of the Highest Clarity, having prepared the offerings according to the ritual, receives the essential formula. They should resolve in their heart to retrieve their lost half and return upward, ensuring their soul is not wronged, and drink the elixir, fulfilling the pledge as a sign of sincerity.\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones said: \"This is truly concise and essential. Only now have we been enlightened, discovering such a wondrous teaching—how could we have remained ignorant for so long? We are overwhelmed by the Heavenly Worthy’s grace in bringing salvation; mere words of gratitude today are insufficient.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Though you have received this formula, you must take the Ten Precepts as your foundation. After transmitting the *Formula of the Two Halves*, proceed to confer the Ten Precepts.\"\n\nThe method for conferring the Ten Precepts:\nThe Dharma Master sits in the south, and the disciple faces them, bowing three times. The disciple then requests: \"I wish to receive the accomplishment and be granted the Ten Precepts, which I vow to uphold for life, swearing never to violate them.\" Thereupon, they kneel, visualizing the Ten Directions’ Great Sages above, and receive the precepts with reverence. The Dharma Master burns incense and expounds the precepts:\n\n1. Do not kill; always cherish all beings.\n2. Do not commit adultery or violate another’s wife.\n3. Do not steal or take wealth unrighteously.\n4. Do not deceive; do not reverse good and evil in speech.\n5. Do not become intoxicated; always reflect on pure conduct.\n6. Maintain harmony with clan and kin, without estrangement.\n7. When seeing others do good, rejoice and assist in spirit.\n8. When seeing others in distress, help them perform meritorious deeds.\n9. If others harm you, resolve not to seek repayment.\n10. Do not expect anything from those who have not yet attained the Dao.\n\nThese are the Ten Precepts.\nThe recipient responds: \"Disciple So-and-So receives them and vows to cultivate them for life.\" They then bow to the master, and the ritual is complete.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Those who receive these Ten Precepts and cultivate them according to the Dharma will be protected by the heavenly officials of the Ten Directions and will surely attain the Dao. If worldly burdens press upon you and you cannot fully uphold all ten, then choose from nine, eight, seven, six, or even five, selecting those you are capable of. Yet even the blessings of the Five Precepts are beyond measure.\n\nYou should widely exhort the multitude, though many, burdened by heavy defilements, may not heed. Even if only one or two respond, patiently and thoroughly enlighten them. If they remain negligent, they will daily drift toward prolonged suffering, and their deep sins will be irredeemable. What then can be done?\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones said: \"If there are virtuous people determined to cultivate diligently, and this matter is at leisure, what else could they seek to hasten their attainment of the Dao?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"The universal teachings and rituals are concealed within the *Three Registers* and the *Precepts of the Three Primes*. The *Three Registers* are the foundation of all scriptures; they have already been revealed to the world and will be bestowed accordingly.\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones asked: \"Are the *Three Registers* the *Golden Register*, *Jade Register*, and *Yellow Register*?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Indeed. These are all teachings beyond form. The ultimate truth of *Concentrating the Mind and Stabilizing the Will* lies in realizing that the wondrous awakening of the Three Primes is non-dual. There are heavens for those with the Dao and hells for those without. Pray to the Seven Mysteries for deliverance from suffering and to save those not yet enlightened.\"\n\nAt that moment, a voice in the air above recited:\n\"This Dharma is truly profound,\nFreeing your nine generations from toil.\nIf this person does not transmit it,\nThey sever others from the Dao.\nIf transmitted to the unworthy,\nThey will face worldly retribution.\nFalling into the Three Wretched Realms at death,\nRegret for ten thousand kalpas will be in vain.\"\n\nThe reason for this recitation in the air is to warn the foolish who, upon obtaining the scripture, might treat it lightly—lending it for copying or giving it away. This would deprive sincere seekers of the means to make offerings, breaking the bridge to the Dharma. Therefore, be cautious, be cautious.\n\nAt that time, the Two Perfected Ones thought to themselves: \"This essential formula is luminous and clear; hearing it brings immediate mystical understanding. Yet all our previous efforts were in vain—what was the obstacle?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, knowing their thoughts, replied: \"Do you two worthy ones not understand? All good and evil arise from causes and conditions. You were meant to receive this from me, hence this transmission. Now I shall explain; listen attentively.\n\nIn a past kalpa, beyond measure like the Ganges’ sands, in an infinitely distant era, there was a devout believer in the Dao named Le Jingxin. He was immensely wealthy, his riches beyond count. Deeply devoted to the Dao and virtue, he meditated in seclusion, vowing in heart and word: 'With such wealth, all is due to blessings. I am indebted to heaven and earth and must repay this grace.' His resolve to repay was sincere, yet he did not know how.\n\nReturning from his private chambers, he asked his wife, explaining his thoughts: 'The Dao does not require wealth—what then should I do?' His wife replied: 'The Dao arises from the heart; where else can it be sought? Simply provide for the needs of Daoist priests. When they are well-supplied, they will fast and uphold the precepts, manifesting the Dao’s affairs—is this not repaying the grace?' Her husband, enlightened by her words, saw their wisdom and was awakened.\n\nTo the south of his mountain lived a Daoist priest who observed perpetual fasting, dwelled in the mountains, and constantly recited scriptures. He lived over two hundred *li* from Jingxin’s home. Jingxin had long heard of this man and felt a deep affinity. He said to his wife: 'I shall go to him, inquire about his needs, and provide for him fully.'\"\n\n\"One must ensure abundance, never allowing scarcity, and should also send modest offerings from time to time.\" His wife said: \"If you can do this, it is truly a fine principle. Even when our eyes close in death, we shall still have something to rely upon. If we do not act thus, our bodies will perish and our spirits will be extinguished, leaving nowhere to seek mercy.\"\n\nJingxin then opened his storehouses and granaries, taking out fine incense, fine cloth, white felt, kapok, silk floss, and silk fabrics, along with bedding, felt tents, and objects of play and adornment—gold, silver, and bronze vessels, all of the finest quality—as well as various medicines. For each item, he prepared a full assortment, freed ten male servants, and had them pack ten loads. He then journeyed to the Daoist priest’s abode. After exchanging a few words and explaining his intentions, he presented the modest offerings to the priest, along with the ten servants to provide long-term service in sweeping and cleaning. He said: \"From now on, if you lack anything, simply send a servant back, and I shall promptly provide it. The people of the Dao would be most fortunate; do not hesitate or doubt.\" The Daoist priest accepted the gifts, and Jingxin took his leave.\n\nUpon returning home, he told his wife everything. Hearing that the priest had accepted, the couple rejoiced, their happiness beyond measure. From then on, this became their regular practice.\n\nAfter some time, Jingxin and his wife sensed their end was near. They had one son, named Fajie, who was seventeen at the time. He attended to his parents’ illness, and as they lay on their deathbeds, they said to him: \"We have acquired this great abundance, our wealth beyond measure—all of it comes from the Dao. We have vowed to repay the boundless grace of the Dao. The Dao does not require wealth; one must only provide for Daoist priests. All that we have done in the mountains, as you have seen, has been for this purpose. Now, our family’s wealth is sufficient for your use; do not abandon this practice.\"\n\nFajie, choking back tears and sobbing, was overwhelmed with grief and sorrow. He cried out to heaven, collapsing and reviving only after his breath had nearly left him. Clutching his parents, he wept and said: \"Father and Mother, you have cultivated such blessings. Even at the end of your lives, your goodness has not waned. Though the Dao of Heaven is distant, how could it not be moved? I only wish that you may swiftly ascend to the halls of fortune and attain the highest rank. When my own life ends, may we meet again, all dwelling in the ranks of the Dao.\"\n\nWith that, his parents passed away. Fajie cried out and fainted, remaining unconscious for a long time before reviving. Because of the harmony and virtue of this father, mother, and son, though they prioritized the Daoist priests, they also aided their relatives, neighbors, and those near and far, all of whom benefited from their kindness.\n\nOn the day of their passing, whether kin or not, none kept their distance—all rushed to attend. Even the household servants were numerous. Witnessing Fajie’s profound filial devotion and his unwavering vow, the assembled crowd could not help but look at one another, tears streaming uncontrollably. \"If even such good people must meet their end, what can be done?\"\n\nAfterward, Fajie, with reverence and a heart naturally inclined toward the Dao, followed his parents’ command. He provided for the Daoist priests, relieved the poor, aided travelers, and extended his generosity to all beings—hundreds of times more than before. Though he took nothing for himself, his expenditures only grew, and he eventually fell into poverty. His support for the Daoist priests, which he had nearly ceased, became even more difficult as the priest grew older and had nowhere else to turn. Each day, the priest burned incense and recalled this patron who had provided for him until he was impoverished. He prayed: \"May the Dao of Heaven acknowledge his sincere heart. Now, I am old and frail—how can I repay him?\"\n\nEvery month on the last day, the Daoist priest performed the six-period ritual of the Dao, constantly remembering Fajie in his heart. Thus, he sent a messenger to summon Fajie, saying: \"You must bow to your patron. At the end of this month, as usual, I shall perform the six-period ritual of the Dao. Though I lack nothing, you should come and join me in accumulating merit. Though the blessings may be distant, they should not be abandoned.\"\n\nFajie received the message and joyfully replied: \"On behalf of Fajie, I bow to you. On the day of your fast, I shall certainly obey your command.\" After the messenger left, Fajie assessed the contents of his household—all the granaries and storehouses were empty, with nothing left to offer. Remembering his father’s teachings, his sorrow deepened, and he considered selling their estate. The estate was vast and grand, unsuitable for ordinary people—only a heavenly king could dwell there. Yet the heavenly king already had his own palace, and some said the estate’s fortune was exhausted, while others claimed it was inauspicious. No buyers came forward. He even considered selling himself, but feared that if he became another’s property, he would never again be able to enter the mountains and see his Daoist priest.\n\nFajie and his wife had two sons to support. The elder, Yinzhu, was eleven, and the younger, Ci’yin, privately called Aservant, had just turned eight. Both were handsome beyond compare, their bearing and speech refined, their voices resonant as jade. In their movements and conduct, they exuded virtue and grace. Though young, they were diligent in their studies, answering questions from near and far with propriety, honoring both kin and strangers. In calligraphy, painting, and speech, they stood above others.\n\nTheir maternal aunt was very wealthy but had no sons. She had always adored these boys, saying: \"I have no sons of my own, but if I could have just one of them, I would pay a million coins—so fond am I of these children that I would not count the cost.\"\n\nFajie suddenly realized this and asked his wife: \"I recall that your sister once wished to have one of our sons. Do you still think so?\" His wife, unaware of his intent, hastily replied: \"Would we ever die together rather than part with such a child? To sell a son just to survive—how could that not add to our sorrow? It would be death in another form; there is no sense in it.\"\n\nHer husband said: \"I wish to sell our son, but not to feed myself or clothe my body.\"\nHis wife asked: \"Then what is it for?\"\nHe replied: \"The Daoist priest in the mountains lacks support. Have you forgotten my father’s last command?\"\n\nHis wife wiped her tears, knelt, and answered: \"Though we are now poor and destitute, this has always been in my heart.\"\n\n\"If this be so, then the matter of accumulating merit and virtue is also my late father’s final instruction—how could we not comply?\"\n\nHis wife said, \"Since our means have failed, we should take the child to inform your sister.\" As mother and son prepared to depart, the boy knelt to bid his father farewell and said, \"I must now leave your side for distant parts—how boundless is my longing. I pray, Father, that you care for yourself and visit me from time to time.\" His filial devotion welled up within him, and they embraced, weeping together. The words \"Little Slave\" and \"Father\" moved heaven and earth. Yinzhu clasped his younger brother’s head, wailing for a long while, and said, \"This act of merit and virtue—I too shall not be long in following. Words cannot express it all.\"\n\nSeeing his sons thus, their father’s heart could not bear it. Fearing his wife might regret her decision, he immediately told her, \"For now, take him to his aunt’s home and pawn him for one hundred thousand coins, to be redeemed within a month. I hope our house will sell by then, and we can surely bring the boy back. If we fail to redeem him by the appointed time, he shall remain with his aunt forever.\" He added, \"I say this not out of indifference to parting, but to ease our sorrow.\"\n\nThus, with hearts torn, mother and son set out. Upon reaching her sister’s home, the mother explained her intent to pawn the child. Hearing this, the sister rejoiced immeasurably. She gave her fifty thousand coins in full, provided three carriages to carry her sister and the money, and sent them back to her home. Yinzhu knelt to bid his mother farewell, saying, \"Father performs such an act of merit—he will surely attain the Dao. Until that day comes, I pray you and Father care for yourselves and visit me often.\"\n\nYinzhu, wishing to comfort his aunt, suppressed his tears. Yet as his mother prepared to board the carriage, the nearness of their parting made their bond too deep to sever. Though he did not cry out, mother, son, and aunt wept streams of tears. Then Yinzhu knelt before his aunt and said, \"Now that I am your son, how am I different from one born to you? Even ordinary partings leave one distraught—I beg your forgiveness.\"\n\nMoved by the boy’s sincerity, his aunt grew even more compassionate and respectful. She took out another hundred thousand coins and said, \"Take this for your father. Give him as much as you wish.\" Yinzhu knelt again and said, \"The gift is too generous.\" He then told his mother, \"Six hundred thousand coins shall be for Father and Mother—this is my heart’s wish, to provide for their daily needs. Though it is but a small offering, I pray it be used for nothing else. Two hundred thousand shall be for my brother, that he may care for you both and remember me from time to time. The remaining two hundred thousand I entrust to the Daoist in the mountains, praying that my parents, brothers, and my aunt may all partake in blessings. I do not say ‘share in blessings together’ but include my aunt’s blessings separately, lest I offend her sensibilities.\"\n\nUpon returning home, the mother longed for her son. The brothers cherished one another deeply, sharing every meal, rest, and play, never apart in their comings and goings. If one tasted something rare, they divided it, never eating alone. \"We were once inseparable,\" they thought, \"yet now I alone return—for the sake of merit.\"\n\nYinzhu, left behind, was filled with sorrow. When he heard his mother had returned with so much money and knew his brother would not, he wiped his tears, covered his face, and knelt to ask, \"When you parted from me, did I not weep as he did?\" His mother, wishing to ease his grief, lied, \"You did not weep. Your aunt missed you both dearly. Overjoyed to have you, she held you close, fed you fruits, and laughed as she bid me farewell, sending money for you.\"\n\nYinzhu knew his brother must have wept, and that his mother was merely comforting him. \"We used to sleep together,\" he thought, \"but now I am alone there. Unaccustomed to it all, I must long for Father and miss my brother. And just parted from my aunt—how could I not weep?\" Sighing, he said, \"Two brothers, suddenly torn apart. Our parents act for the Dao, so the Dao must remember us, that we may both remain strong.\" His words turned to sobs, tears streaming down his face, his breath choked, unable to stop.\n\nFajie then purchased offerings for a vegetarian feast and prepared a grand meal for the Daoist. The Daoist, astonished, asked how he had obtained these things. Fajie dared not deceive him and recounted the events in full. The Daoist said nothing and joined him in the meal. After the feast, Fajie took his leave and returned home. Suddenly, he saw storehouses filled to overflowing—granaries for grain, gold, silver, jewels, pearls, coins, silk, hemp, linen, brocade, and fine fabrics; granaries for rice, wheat, and all manner of grains. He asked his wife, \"Did the authorities store these here?\" She replied, \"No, they simply appeared.\"\n\nThe couple alternated between fear and joy, now suspecting it a dream, now believing it heaven’s mercy, yet unable to find peace. Fajie returned to the mountains to consult the Daoist and recounted all that had happened. The Daoist replied, \"Last night, after my lecture, I dreamed outside the hall that someone presented you with a ruyi of true essence, which you accepted. I pondered whether this was an auspicious omen, but dared not presume its meaning, fearing the matter might not come to pass. Those who shared the meal with me called me deluded—yet now it has come to be. This is indeed heaven’s mercy; who would dare take it away? Moreover, your reverence and faith have reached the distant and mysterious, enough to summon such blessings. You need not doubt; simply use them without hesitation.\"\n\nFajie said, \"I wish to inform the king, that he may know of this.\" The Daoist replied, \"Very well.\" Fajie reported to the king, who answered, \"Your devotion transcends the world—how could heaven not be moved? This is heaven’s mercy; who would dare take it away? Use it without fear, for it brings no harm to me.\"\n\nFajie returned home and told his wife’s brother all that had transpired. The king and the Daoist had spoken with one voice—this was truly heaven’s mercy. His faith deepened further. From then on, their blessings and prosperity flourished without end.\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy asked the two Perfected Ones, \"Do you recognize these people from the three lifetimes?\" The two Perfected Ones replied, \"This matter is long past; we truly do not recall.\" The Heavenly Worthy said, \"The one called Le Jingxin is my present incarnation. Fajie is the Left Mystery Perfected One, and Fajie’s wife is the Right Mystery Perfected One. Do you still remember the kindness of nurturing me in ancient times, which has led to this day? Our mutual enlightenment has its cause.\"\n\nUpon hearing this teaching, the two Perfected Ones at last awakened. Though they recalled the events, the memories were faint and distant, as if from an age long past. Before their words were finished, suddenly an eight-colored cloud chariot appeared, bearing them both. Attended by jade youths and maidens, celestial music filled the air as they ascended from the southeast. Without approaching directly, they first bowed to the Heavenly Worthy, then turned to pay respects to the two Perfected Ones. Only then did the two realize—were these not their own children? And the Lady of the Central Office—was she not the Heavenly Worthy’s former wife, their own mother? After this assembly, they would go to pay their respects.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said, \"Indeed. Do you understand now?\"\n\nThe two Perfected Ones said, \"To sell one’s children to support the Dharma—was this not also suffering?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied, \"How could such deeds be limited in number? Some sold their bodies to uphold the Dharma, some threw themselves to starving tigers, some carved their flesh to feed birds, some sacrificed their lives to nourish insects, some pledged their wives and children, some offered their heads to others. Examples like these, even if recounted for kalpas, could never be exhausted, for their telling knows no end. Why is this so? All such beings were Perfected Ones who had attained the Dao, manifesting these forms to awaken the ignorant and deluded. Their bodies felt no pain, for they clearly perceived the principles of human existence. Some were but illusions—nothing extraordinary. Thus, I spoke of your ancestral line: your father, grandfather, and the six generations of forebears. Though they were ordinary mortals at the time, their deeds were rare and without equal. That is why I told you.\"\n\nThe two Perfected Ones said, \"Truly, as your teaching instructs. Having received the essentials of this scripture and its many precepts, we each rejoice, thinking to ourselves: all such deeds, though subtle, must be joyfully embraced by those with even the slightest karmic affinity.\"\n\nThereupon, they addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying, \"If we now transmit this scripture to others, we are unsure of the proper rituals and the weight of the required offerings. We humbly seek your guidance.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied, \"Since you have not yet fully embodied its essence, it is right that you ask. For this contains profound principles and hidden mysteries—thus it has not been expounded in detail before. Listen carefully and remember well: these prohibitions are most strict. Take heed not to transgress them.\"\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected One of the Right Mystery, saying, \"You, who receive this scripture, may select worthy recipients to transmit it to, without requiring ritual offerings.\"\n\nNext, he addressed the Perfected One of the Left Mystery, saying, \"You, who receive this scripture, must follow the protocols of the netherworld’s ritual codes. The gold coins, patterned silks, and other items used must conform to the prescribed forms. This method originated from the profound contemplation of the Primordial Sovereign of Vast Emptiness and Pure Simplicity, and has long been treasured and practiced by the Five Directional Elders. The recipient must separately present five *fen* of refined gold and five *liang* of undyed silk to honor the spirits of the Five Directional Elders. For the life-extending patterned silk: if the recipient’s destined lifespan is one hundred and twenty years, calculate the excess years, then offer one bolt for a lord or king, one *zhang* for a commoner, and one *chi* for the poor. These three kinds of offerings must not be omitted. To receive the scripture without them is to incur transgression. Adjustments may be made according to wealth, but never omitted.\"\n\nLeft Realized One’s heart harbored doubt and discontent, so he addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"The Right Realized One receives this scripture without requiring offerings, yet I am suddenly burdened with such demands. The scriptural Dharma is one and the same, yet there are two different standards—how can this be explained?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"It is not a matter of partiality. Have you not understood? The multitudes differ, each with their own hearts and minds, so two paths are opened, yet their destination is one. The reason is this: the disciples of the Right Realized One are śramaṇas and lay devotees. Lay devotees universally practice begging, breaking through evil to build the Dharma-bridge. Those who make offerings receive ten-thousandfold blessings in return. Thus, when bestowing the scripture, no strict offerings are demanded. Your disciples, however, even if they practice alms-begging to deliver others, if no one gives, they only increase the giver’s transgressions. Without tangible expressions of faith, how can they attain deliverance? Therefore, the system of Dharma-offerings is established. The retribution of Dharma-offerings is boundless, like the inexhaustible scriptures, yet it does not hinder the merit of the Right Realized One’s generosity.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy continued: \"When the disciples of the Right Realized One make offerings as lay devotees, they reduce and share their wealth with others, gaining ten-thousandfold blessings—but even ten-thousandfold has an end. When the disciples of the Left Realized One present offerings to receive the scripture, this is an act of faith in the Dao, thus offering wealth to the Dao. Therefore, their blessings are as inexhaustible as the scriptures. Though the Left Realized One has received these teachings, his heart has yet to fully grasp the principle that blessings are as inexhaustible as the scriptures. What, then, is this principle?\"\n\nPerceiving his thoughts, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Great Worthy: \"Do you have doubts? There is no cause for suspicion. Why do I say blessings are as inexhaustible as the scriptures? Consider this: if you receive this scripture and transcribe one copy, passing it to one person, ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or countless millions—each person transcribing one copy, and each copy giving rise to limitless others, spreading boundlessly without end—then the blessings from your original Dharma-offering are likewise inexhaustible. Suppose you now offer one *jin* or ten thousand *jin* to receive the scripture from your master; the blessings you gain will be as inexhaustible as the scriptures, never diminishing or depleting. I fear some disciples may not yet understand, so I offer this proximate analogy.\n\n\"The retribution of Dharma-offerings, whether great or small, is like a fine well. Even if the world suffers a great drought and all other sources run dry to a depth of a hundred *zhang*, this well remains full. The well’s owner has enough for their own use and can share the surplus with others. Even if hundreds of thousands or the entire populace of a town draw water freely to relieve suffering without limit, the well never runs dry. This is the natural, inexhaustible retribution.\n\n\"The Heavenly Worthy said: \"Having faith in the Dao, and using that faith to uphold the scriptures, one diminishes the self in word and deed to receive them. The material retribution is inexhaustible, hence called boundless, and one further gains the blessings of faith in the Dao. The blessings of faith in the Dao make one’s spirit and wisdom as bright and boundless as the scriptures. It is like a single lamp igniting a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or countless millions of lamps, illuminating the empty sky. The light of the first lamp remains undiminished—such is the retribution of wisdom, forever inexhaustible.\n\n\"You must universally instruct those who receive the scriptures, guiding them with wisdom to awaken all. Like the well and the lamp, one should not be content with self-sufficiency but strive for sufficiency for all.\"\n\nThe Left Realized One’s heart still harbored doubt: \"Even if the world suffers a great drought and all sources run dry to a depth of a hundred *zhang*, how can the well remain full?\" He wished to ask but dared not.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, already aware of his thoughts, further explained: \"This is why it is called a *fine* well.\" At that moment, the countless immortals and great sages in the empty sky who were listening to the Dharma all attained understanding and, with one voice, praised it as excellent. Each utterance of praise advanced their blessings by three stages.\n\nThe Left Realized One’s doubts dissolved entirely, and he recognized that the requirement of Dharma-offerings was, in fact, a superior principle. He descended from his seat, bowed deeply, and said: \"At last, I have received enlightenment.\"\n\nAt that time, the two who had ridden the cloud carriage were descendants of an ancient lineage—elder and younger brothers. Hearing these essential teachings, they presented one thousand two hundred immortal youths and jade maidens to bow before the Left Realized One, seeking to receive the essential precepts. The Left Realized One immediately bestowed upon them the *Essential Precepts of Subtle Contemplation and Fixed Resolve*. The two brothers, having faith and understanding, entered the third rank of immortals.\n\nSeeing the two receive the scriptures and attain the Dao, the one thousand two hundred immortal youths and jade maidens each removed the pearls and jeweled ornaments from their bodies and offered them to the Left Realized One, seeking to receive the honored scripture. After receiving and reciting it once through, their spirits awakened to understanding. Realizing the emptiness of the Three Realms and that blessings, when exhausted, lead to an end, they each repented their past transgressions. The one thousand two hundred then transformed their bodies and ascended as immortals.\n\nAt that moment, a celestial being in the empty sky doubted the Heavenly Worthy’s analogy, thinking: \"If cultivators of the Dao do not receive the *Essential Precepts of Subtle Contemplation and Fixed Resolve*, it is like entering the sea to gather treasures without a guide. And if one is like the foolish person who gropes blindly in the empty mountains seeking the Son of Heaven’s seal—if this were so, then before this scripture existed at the beginning of creation, how could the Heavenly Worthy and great sages attain the Dao?\"\n\nHaving formed this thought, the Heavenly Worthy immediately knew it. He addressed the celestial being: \"You, not yet among the celestials, how could you know the origins of creation? Those like the Heavenly Worthy and great sages who attained the Dao before the scriptures existed did so through pure simplicity, acting in accord with the natural. Their natural conduct harmonized with principle. In obscurity, they united with principle and naturally attained profound awakening. The principle of profound awakening originally has no written form; it was compiled into scriptures to instruct later generations. What cause for suspicion is there? It is like one who falls into hell—must they first create the laws of hell?\"\n\nThe celestial being praised it as excellent, saying: \"The words of the Sagely Worthy have awakened my foolish ignorance.\" Thereupon, he repented, expressed gratitude, and advanced one stage in immortality.\n\nAt that time, twelve youths, living in worldly ease and pleasure, gathered daily to prepare fine foods, drink heartily, and play in revelry. Sometimes, they would discuss the difficulty or ease of cultivating the Dao.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy, with the eye of the Dao, saw from afar that in this person’s past life, though he had been a teacher of men, he had jealously guarded the awakening contained in the scriptures. Thus, his disciples’ hearts toward the Dao remained hesitant, and for this slight karmic cause, they were still redeemable. Thereupon, the Celestial Worthy transformed into an ordinary man and passed through the gathering, pretending to beg for food. He engaged all the youths in conversation, and they resumed their former discussion.\n\nOne said: \"I have often followed my elder brother to Peaceful Mountain, where I saw all the Daoists strictly observing the Ten Precepts—how solemn and fine it was! If one dies after such a life, the soul’s dwelling will surely not be in vain. Yet to observe all Ten Precepts is difficult for most people.\"\n\nThe transformed one replied: \"To uphold them is very easy; to violate them is difficult.\"\n\nHearing this, the youths all nodded in agreement. One asked: \"Why does the master say that upholding the precepts is easy, while not upholding them is difficult?\"\n\nThe transformed one said: \"To establish oneself according to the precepts is to fear neither the Son of Heaven nor ghosts and spirits—how is this not easy? But one who violates the precepts fears all people and also fears ghosts and spirits—how is this not difficult?\"\n\nThereupon, the twelve youths all conceived the intention to cultivate the Dao and each reflected inwardly. One, whose nature inclined toward wine, spoke first: \"The others may be possible, but wine is hardest to abandon. It is my inherent preference, and I dare not contemplate giving it up. Why? When I first took medicinal powders, on the days they took effect, only wine could relieve them. That is why I dare not abstain.\"\n\nThe transformed one said: \"What is needed to relieve the effects of the powders is medicine. To nurture the Four Great Elements, medicinal wine may be used. But do not exceed the proper measure, lest it be worse than not taking it at all.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Other matters may be possible, but false speech is most difficult. Why? Sometimes one has private affairs, or there are matters concerning elders that should be concealed. Yet when questioned by others, one cannot but deceive, and deceit violates the precepts. That is why it is difficult.\"\n\nThe transformed one said: \"Matters have what should be concealed and what should be revealed; speech has its expedient means—this too may be accommodated. But do not reverse good and evil, speak of others’ faults, or utter words that harm others.\"\n\nAnother said: \"The others may be possible, but the precept against stealing is difficult. Even in small matters, one already transgresses.\"\n\nThe transformed one said: \"Great matters may be difficult, but in small matters, is it not easy to be cautious?\" He then spoke a verse:\n\n*Why not receive the precept against stealing? Not receiving it is also difficult.*\n*Who says darkness conceals? Within, there is an official who records theft.*\n*Take one, and each year it doubles—doubling without end.*\n*With hands cupping molten bronze, it burns the mouth and boils the heart and liver.*\n*Once you speak of this suffering, for a whole year your heart still aches.*\n*Why not receive this precept and preserve it whole?*\n*I trust in it, and so may you—everywhere, there is no lack of peace.*\n*Sit in peace and summon the spirit-being; forever enjoy the joy of long years.*\n\nAnother said: \"All others may be easy, but the precept against lust is hardest to sever. Why? I have experienced this myself. Often, I followed my elder brother to partake of communal meals. During those meals, they would say that for one day, one should be diligent and not transgress principle, and that after death, one would surely gain the merit of such fasting and precepts. Yet when night came, what I pitied would cunningly approach, and though I bitterly restrained myself, before I knew it, I had already succumbed. This happened repeatedly, and so it is most difficult.\"\n\nThe transformed one said: \"Desire is merely a perception. All perceptions are empty—how can there be desire? First observe your own body and know that it has no marvel; then you will know there is no desire—how can you not endure? Moreover, indulgence in lust is like drinking salt water: the more you drink, the thirstier you become, until only death remains. Where is there satisfaction?\" Thereupon, he spoke a verse:\n\n*Desire is more severe than thirst; a little endurance may suffice to cross.*\n*Why advance toward salt water? The saltier the water, the more firmly thirst grips.*\n*If you can skillfully quench thirst, then drink the celestial sweet dew.*\n*Sweet dew is fragrant and aromatic, flowing through the body in every part.*\n*Heavenly beings follow the fragrance and descend; the profound mystery is naturally awakened.*\n*Joyful and free, forever without action, long preserve the blessing of the Nine Heavens.*\n\nAnother said: \"All others I can follow, but the precept against killing is difficult. My nature delights in watching cockfights. If I eat a meal without meat, it is utterly tasteless, and after several days, I grow thin.\"\n\nThe transformed one said: \"The worthy one regards fatness as a human affliction; leanness benefits the body’s lightness—what use is fat?\" He then spoke a verse:\n\n*The worthy one abstains from killing and also does not harbor the thought of killing.*\n*Though beings are small, they all delight in living and growing.*\n*How can you harm their lives to nourish yourself?*\n*This self-nourishment now is but a moment’s pleasure, yet it burdens you with natural clarity.*\n*Long sunk in the Three Wretched Realms, you suffer and are born again.*\n*Good and evil each have their causes, like an echo answering a call.*\n*Why not change this conduct and encourage yourself with a compassionate heart?*\n*The perfected one wanders with folded hands, carefree, observing the floating world.*\n\nAfter speaking this verse, the transformed one revealed his majestic and wondrous form as the Celestial Worthy, his attendants and retinue, and the grand music of the Celestial Realm—beyond what the eye could name—then returned to the upper realms. The youths all saw this, their joy and awe mingled, and having heard the essential teachings, their minds were opened and awakened. Together, they went to the Left Mysterious Perfected One to seek and receive the scriptures and all the Ten Precepts.\n\nThe Perfected One, too, with the eye of the Dao, saw the karmic causes of these youths from past lives, which had led to their difficulty in awakening, and how the Celestial Worthy had condescended to descend and, in many ways, open their understanding. Thus, he acted accordingly. Yet he did not immediately transmit the teachings to them, for though they had the karmic affinity, they could not yet sever all attachments. He only told them to return the next day for the transmission.\n\n\"Tomorrow, tomorrow\"—this went on without end. The youths said to one another: \"Our lives may not last another day. We cannot go on like this, always saying 'tomorrow.' We must each purify ourselves with fasting and sincerity, and together earnestly entreat him.\" They urged one another, saying: \"We will knock our heads to the ground until blood flows in bushels, yet we will not cease.\"\n\nThe Left Perfected One, moved by compassion, must surely grant us this. They declared:\n\n\"We, the youths so-and-so and others, knock our heads in supplication for the Dao, beating ourselves in earnest. Today, the sun has already shifted its light; we constantly fear that our faint qi may suddenly fade into darkness, lost in endless night without dawn. Our solitary souls, trapped in suffering, have nowhere to seek deliverance.\n\nWe have heard that the Celestial Worthy expounds profound and subtle teachings, establishing the resolve of the steadfast—there are the Ten Precepts, concise in text yet essential in practice, encompassing all without omission. We, your humble disciples, earnestly aspire to receive them. Should we obtain them at dawn and perish by dusk, we would harbor no regrets for eternity. Yet if we delay further, day after day, our lives—fleeting as morning mushrooms—may not see tomorrow. Who knows what fortune or misfortune awaits?\n\nSuch a wondrous opportunity emerges but once in ten thousand generations. We have encountered it now, yet if we let it slip away, it would be like a blind man grasping a sparrow—once it flies from his hand, even after ten thousand kalpas, how could it ever be regained? We have exhausted all sincerity, preparing our pledge in accordance with the proper rites. The written petition is presented herewith. With utmost reverence, we bow our heads to the ground and humbly submit our plea, beseeching your favor to grant our request.\"\n\nThus, they respectfully declared.\n\nFive parts gold weighing five taels, five taels of undyed silk, one bolt of life-patterned silk in the remaining years’ measure as required, five *dou* of life-grain, and one bundle of firewood—these five items, prepared according to the proper rites.\n\nHere ends the *Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Sutra of the Dao of Wisdom, Resolute Will, and Penetration of the Subtle*.\n\n#1 Local residents: The Dunhuang manuscript reads \"local people.\"\n#2 Ascended three ranks in blessing: Originally \"blessing suffices three all,\" emended according to the Dunhuang manuscript.",

      "translated_text": "*The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Wisdom, Resolute Will, and Penetrating the Subtle*\n\nAt that time, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy abided in stillness within the Primordial Yang Seven-Jewel Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mysterious Capital, his spirit tranquil in the profound void, serene and non-active. Within the Purple Tenuity Palace, inner and outer radiance shone boundlessly; a hundred harmonious treasures incensed the air without burning, their fragrant light intertwining and surging through the empty sky, drifting and flowing, scattering endlessly. The adorned brilliance was distant and rich, soft and cool, its purity and elegance beyond description. The celestial harmony played in myriad forms, all intermingling.\n\nSuddenly, the Heavenly Worthy, without so much as a glance, reflected upon the origins of the myriad beings: though their embryonic endowments were the same, each coalesced from the qi of primordial chaos to form their spirits. The spirit, originally pure and limpid, untainted, once infused into form, became stained by the six emotions. With the first contamination of the six emotions, movement gave rise to defilement—deluded by what they saw, obscured by what they clung to, worldly affairs and conditions arose in succession. Thus they attracted karmic filth, accumulating it life after life, revolving through the Three Realms, adrift and forgetful of return; drifting through the Five Paths, sinking endlessly without awakening. Embracing pain and poison, they remain unaware, their spirits racing in terror, treading only the path of transgression.\n\nMoved by profound compassion, he could not bear it. Recalling the beginning of their endowment, the principle was truly pitiable. He then dispatched an attendant minister to summon the Left Mystery Perfected and the Right Mystery Perfected. In an instant, the two Perfected Ones arrived in person, bowed in reverence, and took their seats in due order. After some time seated in attendance, their casual conversation subsided.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke: \"The reason I have summoned you is precisely to address this. I have just reflected upon the origins of the countless beings—thus it is. Yet this principle may still be saved. You two worthies have already aroused great compassion and great mercy; should you not share in this aspiration?\"",

      "translated_text": "The Two Perfected Ones replied: \"The multitudes wallow in suffering, ever within our reach, and we have already done all we could—teaching them in detail, explaining the consequences of sin and merit to the utmost. Yet there remain stubborn, foolish people who persist in disbelief. Even if they briefly believe, their faith fades within days or months, and they relapse into negligence. This, too, is a matter for the Heavenly Worthy’s discernment—what is to be done?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Though they grow negligent, even a moment’s faith is no small merit. You two worthies have already planted this merit; it is fitting to commend them.\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones asked: \"We wonder what method might surely awaken them.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy answered: \"Such people are benighted. If shown broad paths, the texts are too numerous and the affairs too trifling for their understanding. What they cannot grasp breeds only weariness. Now, if we distill the essentials into concise language and present them clearly, it will be different.\"\n\nThereupon, the Two Perfected Ones rose from their seats, bowed to the Heavenly Worthy, and asked: \"What concise essentials might open their awakening?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Return to your seats. I wish to impart to you the *Essential Formula for Concentrating the Mind through Subtle Reflection*. Its essence is simplicity; from simplicity comes awakening—is this not swift?\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones asked: \"Is there a scripture for *Concentrating the Mind through Subtle Reflection*?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"There are no written words.\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones said: \"Such people are like those who dash against walls—utterly deluded. Without written words, how can they awaken?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"Were all scriptures originally written? Are not today’s words also scripture?\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones said: \"We beg to hear them; we shall record them at once.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Suppose there were people—thousands or tens of thousands—who desired treasures. Hearing of their abundance in the sea, they each prepared vessels, some rafts, some ships, hundreds or thousands of them, and set sail upon the great ocean, traveling thousands of miles, near or far. There were hundreds of islands and countless isles, some submerged, where treasures abounded—even limitless seven-jeweled radiance, each light piercing the sky in different hues. Yet among so many sailing companions, when the wind was right for departure, none recognized the light. They set forth blindly, not knowing their direction.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy continued: \"Could these companions obtain treasures?\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones said: \"Without a guide, with no foreknowledge of the way, and unable to recognize the treasure’s light, they would wander in confusion. This journey would be most difficult. They would have to search every place, dig everywhere, and even in the water, expend a hundredfold effort—perhaps then they might succeed.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Those who study the Dao yet lack the *Essential Formula for Concentrating the Mind through Subtle Reflection* are like these people, unable to recognize the treasure’s light yet seeking treasure—how pitiable!\n\n\"Now, suppose among this multitude, one person could recognize the treasure’s light. The radiance pierced the sky, visible from ten thousand miles away, as if seen in the palm of the hand. Though many could not see it, the one who could raised the sail and went first, and all the ships followed, arriving directly at the treasure’s place. They all obtained great quantities of seven-jeweled treasures, loading their vessels to the full and returning to their homeland. The companions then said: ‘Thanks to our guide, we should now repay his kindness.’ Each ship gathered treasures worth billions, offering them in gratitude—was this not joyous?\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones asked: \"What profit is so great?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Those who study the Dao and obtain this *Essential Formula for Concentrating the Mind through Subtle Reflection* are like the one who recognized the treasure’s light.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy continued: \"In ancient and distant kalpas, when the mandate of a Heavenly King expired and the world was to change rulers, whoever obtained the celestial regalia would become the Son of Heaven. A skilled physiognomist saw the regalia’s light upon a mountain. That very night, a great storm raged, and torches could not stand. The light shone in the darkness, yet no one saw it. The master said to the villagers: ‘The celestial regalia of the Son of Heaven lies within this mountain.’ The villagers heard and secretly went, but in the darkness, they could not find it. Those who study without the *Essential Formula for Concentrating the Mind* are like those groping in the dark. When the physiognomist heard that the people could not find the regalia, he went himself and obtained it at once, ascending to the heavenly throne. If one attains this *Essential Formula*, the mind becomes settled, and the quest for the Dao is certain—like that physiognomist who recognized the treasure. Do not lightly disclose it. Those who do shall incur the guardians’ punishment, a sin not easily absolved. Why? Not only is it a slight to the scripture, but to the Dao itself. Let those who receive this teaching be ever vigilant.\"\n\nHearing this, the Two Perfected Ones rejoiced boundlessly, their inner and outer selves in accord, and begged to hear more.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Since I wish to tell you, how could I conceal it? Now, the essential formula: Know that within the Three Realms, the Three Times are all empty. Knowing the Three Times are empty, though you have a self, it too should return to emptiness. Understanding this principle of returning to emptiness, you can forget the self. One who forgets the self—how could they still cling to it? With no attachment to the self, one can abandon all attachments, loving only the Dao. One who loves the Dao—the Dao also loves them. To be loved by the Dao is to return to truth. The *Essential Formula for Concentrating the Mind* is fully contained herein. This is the return of the two halves to one, the return of the original One to truth. With the Dao’s work ascending daily, shall we not be free from care and toil?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy continued: \"The two halves becoming one has five meanings—do you understand?\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones replied: \"We do. Is it not that from the pure and empty *qi*, through the mingling of *yinyun*, half descended, joining with these four halves to become one? Or is it that when this provisional one turns to evil, it summons the natural *qi*, sinking into the Three Wretched Realms?\"",

      "translated_text": "\"Or is it that by doing good, one leaves these four halves to ascend to the Great Void, restoring one’s pure and empty *qi*, reuniting one’s two halves, and dwelling in spontaneity?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"You have grasped it. Now I shall display the *Wheel-Turning Diagram of the Two Halves* in the air before the Left Perfected One below.\"\n\nThe *Diagram of the Two Halves* is as follows:\nIt is also called the *True Contract for Concentrating the Mind and Stabilizing the Will*.\nThe ritual requires:\n- Twenty-four thousand gold coins,\n- Five taels of refined gold,\n- One bolt each of five-colored patterned silk,\n- Five taels of plain silk,\n- One bolt each of five-directional patterned silk,\n- One mirror,\n- One bolt of life-destiny patterned silk (one bolt per year in excess),\n- One pair of gold buttons,\n- And various other items as needed.\n\nWhen transmitting this, the giver must clearly divide it into twelve sections. If the transmission is incomplete, it violates the precepts, and the offense is multiplied fourfold. If the recipient’s ritual offerings are insufficient and their *qi* is weak or deficient, they also incur guilt, equal to the offense of violating the transmission precepts—except for wandering and destitute Daoist priests.\n\nThe disciple So-and-So of the Highest Clarity, having prepared the offerings according to the ritual, receives the essential formula. They should resolve in their heart to retrieve their lost half and return upward, ensuring their soul is not wronged, and drink the elixir, fulfilling the pledge as a sign of sincerity.\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones said: \"This is truly concise and essential. Only now have we been enlightened, discovering such a wondrous teaching—how could we have remained ignorant for so long? We are overwhelmed by the Heavenly Worthy’s grace in bringing salvation; mere words of gratitude today are insufficient.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Though you have received this formula, you must take the Ten Precepts as your foundation. After transmitting the *Formula of the Two Halves*, proceed to confer the Ten Precepts.\"\n\nThe method for conferring the Ten Precepts:\nThe Dharma Master sits in the south, and the disciple faces them, bowing three times. The disciple then requests: \"I wish to receive the accomplishment and be granted the Ten Precepts, which I vow to uphold for life, swearing never to violate them.\" Thereupon, they kneel, visualizing the Ten Directions’ Great Sages above, and receive the precepts with reverence. The Dharma Master burns incense and expounds the precepts:\n\n1. Do not kill; always cherish all beings.\n2. Do not commit adultery or violate another’s wife.\n3. Do not steal or take wealth unrighteously.\n4. Do not deceive; do not reverse good and evil in speech.\n5. Do not become intoxicated; always reflect on pure conduct.\n6. Maintain harmony with clan and kin, without estrangement.\n7. When seeing others do good, rejoice and assist in spirit.\n8. When seeing others in distress, help them perform meritorious deeds.\n9. If others harm you, resolve not to seek repayment.\n10. Do not expect anything from those who have not yet attained the Dao.\n\nThese are the Ten Precepts.\nThe recipient responds: \"Disciple So-and-So receives them and vows to cultivate them for life.\" They then bow to the master, and the ritual is complete.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Those who receive these Ten Precepts and cultivate them according to the Dharma will be protected by the heavenly officials of the Ten Directions and will surely attain the Dao. If worldly burdens press upon you and you cannot fully uphold all ten, then choose from nine, eight, seven, six, or even five, selecting those you are capable of. Yet even the blessings of the Five Precepts are beyond measure.\n\nYou should widely exhort the multitude, though many, burdened by heavy defilements, may not heed. Even if only one or two respond, patiently and thoroughly enlighten them. If they remain negligent, they will daily drift toward prolonged suffering, and their deep sins will be irredeemable. What then can be done?\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones said: \"If there are virtuous people determined to cultivate diligently, and this matter is at leisure, what else could they seek to hasten their attainment of the Dao?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"The universal teachings and rituals are concealed within the *Three Registers* and the *Precepts of the Three Primes*. The *Three Registers* are the foundation of all scriptures; they have already been revealed to the world and will be bestowed accordingly.\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones asked: \"Are the *Three Registers* the *Golden Register*, *Jade Register*, and *Yellow Register*?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Indeed. These are all teachings beyond form. The ultimate truth of *Concentrating the Mind and Stabilizing the Will* lies in realizing that the wondrous awakening of the Three Primes is non-dual. There are heavens for those with the Dao and hells for those without. Pray to the Seven Mysteries for deliverance from suffering and to save those not yet enlightened.\"\n\nAt that moment, a voice in the air above recited:\n\"This Dharma is truly profound,\nFreeing your nine generations from toil.\nIf this person does not transmit it,\nThey sever others from the Dao.\nIf transmitted to the unworthy,\nThey will face worldly retribution.\nFalling into the Three Wretched Realms at death,\nRegret for ten thousand kalpas will be in vain.\"\n\nThe reason for this recitation in the air is to warn the foolish who, upon obtaining the scripture, might treat it lightly—lending it for copying or giving it away. This would deprive sincere seekers of the means to make offerings, breaking the bridge to the Dharma. Therefore, be cautious, be cautious.\n\nAt that time, the Two Perfected Ones thought to themselves: \"This essential formula is luminous and clear; hearing it brings immediate mystical understanding. Yet all our previous efforts were in vain—what was the obstacle?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, knowing their thoughts, replied: \"Do you two worthy ones not understand? All good and evil arise from causes and conditions. You were meant to receive this from me, hence this transmission. Now I shall explain; listen attentively.\n\nIn a past kalpa, beyond measure like the Ganges’ sands, in an infinitely distant era, there was a devout believer in the Dao named Le Jingxin. He was immensely wealthy, his riches beyond count. Deeply devoted to the Dao and virtue, he meditated in seclusion, vowing in heart and word: 'With such wealth, all is due to blessings. I am indebted to heaven and earth and must repay this grace.' His resolve to repay was sincere, yet he did not know how.\n\nReturning from his private chambers, he asked his wife, explaining his thoughts: 'The Dao does not require wealth—what then should I do?' His wife replied: 'The Dao arises from the heart; where else can it be sought? Simply provide for the needs of Daoist priests. When they are well-supplied, they will fast and uphold the precepts, manifesting the Dao’s affairs—is this not repaying the grace?' Her husband, enlightened by her words, saw their wisdom and was awakened.\n\nTo the south of his mountain lived a Daoist priest who observed perpetual fasting, dwelled in the mountains, and constantly recited scriptures. He lived over two hundred *li* from Jingxin’s home. Jingxin had long heard of this man and felt a deep affinity. He said to his wife: 'I shall go to him, inquire about his needs, and provide for him fully.'\"",
      "overlap_context": "l One to truth. With the Dao’s work ascending daily, shall we not be free from care and toil?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy continued: \"The two halves becoming one has five meanings—do you understand?\"\n\nThe Two Perfected Ones replied: \"We do. Is it not that from the pure and empty *qi*, through the mingling of *yinyun*, half descended, joining with these four halves to become one? Or is it that when this provisional one turns to evil, it summons the natural *qi*, sinking into the Three Wretched Realms?\"",

      "translated_text": "\"One must ensure abundance, never allowing scarcity, and should also send modest offerings from time to time.\" His wife said: \"If you can do this, it is truly a fine principle. Even when our eyes close in death, we shall still have something to rely upon. If we do not act thus, our bodies will perish and our spirits will be extinguished, leaving nowhere to seek mercy.\"\n\nJingxin then opened his storehouses and granaries, taking out fine incense, fine cloth, white felt, kapok, silk floss, and silk fabrics, along with bedding, felt tents, and objects of play and adornment—gold, silver, and bronze vessels, all of the finest quality—as well as various medicines. For each item, he prepared a full assortment, freed ten male servants, and had them pack ten loads. He then journeyed to the Daoist priest’s abode. After exchanging a few words and explaining his intentions, he presented the modest offerings to the priest, along with the ten servants to provide long-term service in sweeping and cleaning. He said: \"From now on, if you lack anything, simply send a servant back, and I shall promptly provide it. The people of the Dao would be most fortunate; do not hesitate or doubt.\" The Daoist priest accepted the gifts, and Jingxin took his leave.\n\nUpon returning home, he told his wife everything. Hearing that the priest had accepted, the couple rejoiced, their happiness beyond measure. From then on, this became their regular practice.\n\nAfter some time, Jingxin and his wife sensed their end was near. They had one son, named Fajie, who was seventeen at the time. He attended to his parents’ illness, and as they lay on their deathbeds, they said to him: \"We have acquired this great abundance, our wealth beyond measure—all of it comes from the Dao. We have vowed to repay the boundless grace of the Dao. The Dao does not require wealth; one must only provide for Daoist priests. All that we have done in the mountains, as you have seen, has been for this purpose. Now, our family’s wealth is sufficient for your use; do not abandon this practice.\"\n\nFajie, choking back tears and sobbing, was overwhelmed with grief and sorrow. He cried out to heaven, collapsing and reviving only after his breath had nearly left him. Clutching his parents, he wept and said: \"Father and Mother, you have cultivated such blessings. Even at the end of your lives, your goodness has not waned. Though the Dao of Heaven is distant, how could it not be moved? I only wish that you may swiftly ascend to the halls of fortune and attain the highest rank. When my own life ends, may we meet again, all dwelling in the ranks of the Dao.\"\n\nWith that, his parents passed away. Fajie cried out and fainted, remaining unconscious for a long time before reviving. Because of the harmony and virtue of this father, mother, and son, though they prioritized the Daoist priests, they also aided their relatives, neighbors, and those near and far, all of whom benefited from their kindness.\n\nOn the day of their passing, whether kin or not, none kept their distance—all rushed to attend. Even the household servants were numerous. Witnessing Fajie’s profound filial devotion and his unwavering vow, the assembled crowd could not help but look at one another, tears streaming uncontrollably. \"If even such good people must meet their end, what can be done?\"\n\nAfterward, Fajie, with reverence and a heart naturally inclined toward the Dao, followed his parents’ command. He provided for the Daoist priests, relieved the poor, aided travelers, and extended his generosity to all beings—hundreds of times more than before. Though he took nothing for himself, his expenditures only grew, and he eventually fell into poverty. His support for the Daoist priests, which he had nearly ceased, became even more difficult as the priest grew older and had nowhere else to turn. Each day, the priest burned incense and recalled this patron who had provided for him until he was impoverished. He prayed: \"May the Dao of Heaven acknowledge his sincere heart. Now, I am old and frail—how can I repay him?\"\n\nEvery month on the last day, the Daoist priest performed the six-period ritual of the Dao, constantly remembering Fajie in his heart. Thus, he sent a messenger to summon Fajie, saying: \"You must bow to your patron. At the end of this month, as usual, I shall perform the six-period ritual of the Dao. Though I lack nothing, you should come and join me in accumulating merit. Though the blessings may be distant, they should not be abandoned.\"\n\nFajie received the message and joyfully replied: \"On behalf of Fajie, I bow to you. On the day of your fast, I shall certainly obey your command.\" After the messenger left, Fajie assessed the contents of his household—all the granaries and storehouses were empty, with nothing left to offer. Remembering his father’s teachings, his sorrow deepened, and he considered selling their estate. The estate was vast and grand, unsuitable for ordinary people—only a heavenly king could dwell there. Yet the heavenly king already had his own palace, and some said the estate’s fortune was exhausted, while others claimed it was inauspicious. No buyers came forward. He even considered selling himself, but feared that if he became another’s property, he would never again be able to enter the mountains and see his Daoist priest.\n\nFajie and his wife had two sons to support. The elder, Yinzhu, was eleven, and the younger, Ci’yin, privately called Aservant, had just turned eight. Both were handsome beyond compare, their bearing and speech refined, their voices resonant as jade. In their movements and conduct, they exuded virtue and grace. Though young, they were diligent in their studies, answering questions from near and far with propriety, honoring both kin and strangers. In calligraphy, painting, and speech, they stood above others.\n\nTheir maternal aunt was very wealthy but had no sons. She had always adored these boys, saying: \"I have no sons of my own, but if I could have just one of them, I would pay a million coins—so fond am I of these children that I would not count the cost.\"\n\nFajie suddenly realized this and asked his wife: \"I recall that your sister once wished to have one of our sons. Do you still think so?\" His wife, unaware of his intent, hastily replied: \"Would we ever die together rather than part with such a child? To sell a son just to survive—how could that not add to our sorrow? It would be death in another form; there is no sense in it.\"\n\nHer husband said: \"I wish to sell our son, but not to feed myself or clothe my body.\"\nHis wife asked: \"Then what is it for?\"\nHe replied: \"The Daoist priest in the mountains lacks support. Have you forgotten my father’s last command?\"\n\nHis wife wiped her tears, knelt, and answered: \"Though we are now poor and destitute, this has always been in my heart.\"",

I pray, Father, that you care for yourself and visit me from time to time.\" His filial devotion welled up within him, and they embraced, weeping together. The words \"Little Slave\" and \"Father\" moved heaven and earth. Yinzhu clasped his younger brother’s head, wailing for a long while, and said, \"This act of merit and virtue—I too shall not be long in following. Words cannot express it all.\"\n\nSeeing his sons thus, their father’s heart could not bear it. Fearing his wife might regret her decision, he immediately told her, \"For now, take him to his aunt’s home and pawn him for one hundred thousand coins, to be redeemed within a month. I hope our house will sell by then, and we can surely bring the boy back. If we fail to redeem him by the appointed time, he shall remain with his aunt forever.\" He added, \"I say this not out of indifference to parting, but to ease our sorrow.\"\n\nThus, with hearts torn, mother and son set out. Upon reaching her sister’s home, the mother explained her intent to pawn the child. Hearing this, the sister rejoiced immeasurably. She gave her fifty thousand coins in full, provided three carriages to carry her sister and the money, and sent them back to her home. Yinzhu knelt to bid his mother farewell, saying, \"Father performs such an act of merit—he will surely attain the Dao. Until that day comes, I pray you and Father care for yourselves and visit me often.\"\n\nYinzhu, wishing to comfort his aunt, suppressed his tears. Yet as his mother prepared to board the carriage, the nearness of their parting made their bond too deep to sever. Though he did not cry out, mother, son, and aunt wept streams of tears. Then Yinzhu knelt before his aunt and said, \"Now that I am your son, how am I different from one born to you? Even ordinary partings leave one distraught—I beg your forgiveness.\"\n\nMoved by the boy’s sincerity, his aunt grew even more compassionate and respectful. She took out another hundred thousand coins and said, \"Take this for your father. Give him as much as you wish.\" Yinzhu knelt again and said, \"The gift is too generous.\" He then told his mother, \"Six hundred thousand coins shall be for Father and Mother—this is my heart’s wish, to provide for their daily needs. Though it is but a small offering, I pray it be used for nothing else. Two hundred thousand shall be for my brother, that he may care for you both and remember me from time to time. The remaining two hundred thousand I entrust to the Daoist in the mountains, praying that my parents, brothers, and my aunt may all partake in blessings. I do not say ‘share in blessings together’ but include my aunt’s blessings separately, lest I offend her sensibilities.\"\n\nUpon returning home, the mother longed for her son. The brothers cherished one another deeply, sharing every meal, rest, and play, never apart in their comings and goings. If one tasted something rare, they divided it, never eating alone. \"We were once inseparable,\" they thought, \"yet now I alone return—for the sake of merit.\"\n\nYinzhu, left behind, was filled with sorrow. When he heard his mother had returned with so much money and knew his brother would not, he wiped his tears, covered his face, and knelt to ask, \"When you parted from me, did I not weep as he did?\" His mother, wishing to ease his grief, lied, \"You did not weep. Your aunt missed you both dearly. Overjoyed to have you, she held you close, fed you fruits, and laughed as she bid me farewell, sending money for you.\"\n\nYinzhu knew his brother must have wept, and that his mother was merely comforting him. \"We used to sleep together,\" he thought, \"but now I am alone there. Unaccustomed to it all, I must long for Father and miss my brother. And just parted from my aunt—how could I not weep?\" Sighing, he said, \"Two brothers, suddenly torn apart. Our parents act for the Dao, so the Dao must remember us, that we may both remain strong.\" His words turned to sobs, tears streaming down his face, his breath choked, unable to stop.\n\nFajie then purchased offerings for a vegetarian feast and prepared a grand meal for the Daoist. The Daoist, astonished, asked how he had obtained these things. Fajie dared not deceive him and recounted the events in full. The Daoist said nothing and joined him in the meal. After the feast, Fajie took his leave and returned home. Suddenly, he saw storehouses filled to overflowing—granaries for grain, gold, silver, jewels, pearls, coins, silk, hemp, linen, brocade, and fine fabrics; granaries for rice, wheat, and all manner of grains. He asked his wife, \"Did the authorities store these here?\" She replied, \"No, they simply appeared.\"",

Have you forgotten my father’s last command?\"\n\nHis wife wiped her tears, knelt, and answered: \"Though we are now poor and destitute, this has always been in my heart.\"",

Fajie returned to the mountains to consult the Daoist and recounted all that had happened. The Daoist replied, \"Last night, after my lecture, I dreamed outside the hall that someone presented you with a ruyi of true essence, which you accepted. I pondered whether this was an auspicious omen, but dared not presume its meaning, fearing the matter might not come to pass. Those who shared the meal with me called me deluded—yet now it has come to be. This is indeed heaven’s mercy; who would dare take it away? Moreover, your reverence and faith have reached the distant and mysterious, enough to summon such blessings. You need not doubt; simply use them without hesitation.\"\n\nFajie said, \"I wish to inform the king, that he may know of this.\" The Daoist replied, \"Very well.\" Fajie reported to the king, who answered, \"Your devotion transcends the world—how could heaven not be moved? This is heaven’s mercy; who would dare take it away? Use it without fear, for it brings no harm to me.\"\n\nFajie returned home and told his wife’s brother all that had transpired. The king and the Daoist had spoken with one voice—this was truly heaven’s mercy. His faith deepened further. From then on, their blessings and prosperity flourished without end.\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy asked the two Perfected Ones, \"Do you recognize these people from the three lifetimes?\" The two Perfected Ones replied, \"This matter is long past; we truly do not recall.\" The Heavenly Worthy said, \"The one called Le Jingxin is my present incarnation. Fajie is the Left Mystery Perfected One, and Fajie’s wife is the Right Mystery Perfected One. Do you still remember the kindness of nurturing me in ancient times, which has led to this day? Our mutual enlightenment has its cause.\"\n\nUpon hearing this teaching, the two Perfected Ones at last awakened. Though they recalled the events, the memories were faint and distant, as if from an age long past. Before their words were finished, suddenly an eight-colored cloud chariot appeared, bearing them both. Attended by jade youths and maidens, celestial music filled the air as they ascended from the southeast. Without approaching directly, they first bowed to the Heavenly Worthy, then turned to pay respects to the two Perfected Ones. Only then did the two realize—were these not their own children?

Examples like these, even if recounted for kalpas, could never be exhausted, for their telling knows no end. Why is this so? All such beings were Perfected Ones who had attained the Dao, manifesting these forms to awaken the ignorant and deluded. Their bodies felt no pain, for they clearly perceived the principles of human existence. Some were but illusions—nothing extraordinary. Thus, I spoke of your ancestral line: your father, grandfather, and the six generations of forebears. Though they were ordinary mortals at the time, their deeds were rare and without equal. That is why I told you.\"\n\nThe two Perfected Ones said, \"Truly, as your teaching instructs.

      "translated_text": "Left Realized One’s heart harbored doubt and discontent, so he addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"The Right Realized One receives this scripture without requiring offerings, yet I am suddenly burdened with such demands. The scriptural Dharma is one and the same, yet there are two different standards—how can this be explained?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"It is not a matter of partiality. Have you not understood? The multitudes differ, each with their own hearts and minds, so two paths are opened, yet their destination is one. The reason is this: the disciples of the Right Realized One are śramaṇas and lay devotees. Lay devotees universally practice begging, breaking through evil to build the Dharma-bridge. Those who make offerings receive ten-thousandfold blessings in return. Thus, when bestowing the scripture, no strict offerings are demanded. Your disciples, however, even if they practice alms-begging to deliver others, if no one gives, they only increase the giver’s transgressions. Without tangible expressions of faith, how can they attain deliverance? Therefore, the system of Dharma-offerings is established. The retribution of Dharma-offerings is boundless, like the inexhaustible scriptures, yet it does not hinder the merit of the Right Realized One’s generosity.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy continued: \"When the disciples of the Right Realized One make offerings as lay devotees, they reduce and share their wealth with others, gaining ten-thousandfold blessings—but even ten-thousandfold has an end. When the disciples of the Left Realized One present offerings to receive the scripture, this is an act of faith in the Dao, thus offering wealth to the Dao. Therefore, their blessings are as inexhaustible as the scriptures. Though the Left Realized One has received these teachings, his heart has yet to fully grasp the principle that blessings are as inexhaustible as the scriptures. What, then, is this principle?\"\n\nPerceiving his thoughts, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Great Worthy: \"Do you have doubts? There is no cause for suspicion. Why do I say blessings are as inexhaustible as the scriptures? Consider this: if you receive this scripture and transcribe one copy, passing it to one person, ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or countless millions—each person transcribing one copy, and each copy giving rise to limitless others, spreading boundlessly without end—then the blessings from your original Dharma-offering are likewise inexhaustible. Suppose you now offer one *jin* or ten thousand *jin* to receive the scripture from your master; the blessings you gain will be as inexhaustible as the scriptures, never diminishing or depleting. I fear some disciples may not yet understand, so I offer this proximate analogy.\n\n\"The retribution of Dharma-offerings, whether great or small, is like a fine well. Even if the world suffers a great drought and all other sources run dry to a depth of a hundred *zhang*, this well remains full. The well’s owner has enough for their own use and can share the surplus with others. Even if hundreds of thousands or the entire populace of a town draw water freely to relieve suffering without limit, the well never runs dry. This is the natural, inexhaustible retribution.\n\n\"The Heavenly Worthy said: \"Having faith in the Dao, and using that faith to uphold the scriptures, one diminishes the self in word and deed to receive them. The material retribution is inexhaustible, hence called boundless, and one further gains the blessings of faith in the Dao. The blessings of faith in the Dao make one’s spirit and wisdom as bright and boundless as the scriptures. It is like a single lamp igniting a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or countless millions of lamps, illuminating the empty sky. The light of the first lamp remains undiminished—such is the retribution of wisdom, forever inexhaustible.\n\n\"You must universally instruct those who receive the scriptures, guiding them with wisdom to awaken all. Like the well and the lamp, one should not be content with self-sufficiency but strive for sufficiency for all.\"\n\nThe Left Realized One’s heart still harbored doubt: \"Even if the world suffers a great drought and all sources run dry to a depth of a hundred *zhang*, how can the well remain full?\" He wished to ask but dared not.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, already aware of his thoughts, further explained: \"This is why it is called a *fine* well.\" At that moment, the countless immortals and great sages in the empty sky who were listening to the Dharma all attained understanding and, with one voice, praised it as excellent. Each utterance of praise advanced their blessings by three stages.\n\nThe Left Realized One’s doubts dissolved entirely, and he recognized that the requirement of Dharma-offerings was, in fact, a superior principle. He descended from his seat, bowed deeply, and said: \"At last, I have received enlightenment.\"\n\nAt that time, the two who had ridden the cloud carriage were descendants of an ancient lineage—elder and younger brothers. Hearing these essential teachings, they presented one thousand two hundred immortal youths and jade maidens to bow before the Left Realized One, seeking to receive the essential precepts. The Left Realized One immediately bestowed upon them the *Essential Precepts of Subtle Contemplation and Fixed Resolve*. The two brothers, having faith and understanding, entered the third rank of immortals.\n\nSeeing the two receive the scriptures and attain the Dao, the one thousand two hundred immortal youths and jade maidens each removed the pearls and jeweled ornaments from their bodies and offered them to the Left Realized One, seeking to receive the honored scripture. After receiving and reciting it once through, their spirits awakened to understanding. Realizing the emptiness of the Three Realms and that blessings, when exhausted, lead to an end, they each repented their past transgressions. The one thousand two hundred then transformed their bodies and ascended as immortals.\n\nAt that moment, a celestial being in the empty sky doubted the Heavenly Worthy’s analogy, thinking: \"If cultivators of the Dao do not receive the *Essential Precepts of Subtle Contemplation and Fixed Resolve*, it is like entering the sea to gather treasures without a guide. And if one is like the foolish person who gropes blindly in the empty mountains seeking the Son of Heaven’s seal—if this were so, then before this scripture existed at the beginning of creation, how could the Heavenly Worthy and great sages attain the Dao?\"\n\nHaving formed this thought, the Heavenly Worthy immediately knew it. He addressed the celestial being: \"You, not yet among the celestials, how could you know the origins of creation? Those like the Heavenly Worthy and great sages who attained the Dao before the scriptures existed did so through pure simplicity, acting in accord with the natural. Their natural conduct harmonized with principle. In obscurity, they united with principle and naturally attained profound awakening. The principle of profound awakening originally has no written form; it was compiled into scriptures to instruct later generations. What cause for suspicion is there? It is like one who falls into hell—must they first create the laws of hell?\"\n\nThe celestial being praised it as excellent, saying: \"The words of the Sagely Worthy have awakened my foolish ignorance.\" Thereupon, he repented, expressed gratitude, and advanced one stage in immortality.\n\nAt that time, twelve youths, living in worldly ease and pleasure, gathered daily to prepare fine foods, drink heartily, and play in revelry. Sometimes, they would discuss the difficulty or ease of cultivating the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "The Celestial Worthy, with the eye of the Dao, saw from afar that in this person’s past life, though he had been a teacher of men, he had jealously guarded the awakening contained in the scriptures. Thus, his disciples’ hearts toward the Dao remained hesitant, and for this slight karmic cause, they were still redeemable. Thereupon, the Celestial Worthy transformed into an ordinary man and passed through the gathering, pretending to beg for food. He engaged all the youths in conversation, and they resumed their former discussion.\n\nOne said: \"I have often followed my elder brother to Peaceful Mountain, where I saw all the Daoists strictly observing the Ten Precepts—how solemn and fine it was! If one dies after such a life, the soul’s dwelling will surely not be in vain. Yet to observe all Ten Precepts is difficult for most people.\"\n\nThe transformed one replied: \"To uphold them is very easy; to violate them is difficult.\"\n\nHearing this, the youths all nodded in agreement. One asked: \"Why does the master say that upholding the precepts is easy, while not upholding them is difficult?\"\n\nThe transformed one said: \"To establish oneself according to the precepts is to fear neither the Son of Heaven nor ghosts and spirits—how is this not easy? But one who violates the precepts fears all people and also fears ghosts and spirits—how is this not difficult?\"\n\nThereupon, the twelve youths all conceived the intention to cultivate the Dao and each reflected inwardly. One, whose nature inclined toward wine, spoke first: \"The others may be possible, but wine is hardest to abandon. It is my inherent preference, and I dare not contemplate giving it up. Why? When I first took medicinal powders, on the days they took effect, only wine could relieve them. That is why I dare not abstain.\"\n\nThe transformed one said: \"What is needed to relieve the effects of the powders is medicine. To nurture the Four Great Elements, medicinal wine may be used. But do not exceed the proper measure, lest it be worse than not taking it at all.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Other matters may be possible, but false speech is most difficult. Why? Sometimes one has private affairs, or there are matters concerning elders that should be concealed. Yet when questioned by others, one cannot but deceive, and deceit violates the precepts. That is why it is difficult.\"\n\nThe transformed one said: \"Matters have what should be concealed and what should be revealed; speech has its expedient means—this too may be accommodated. But do not reverse good and evil, speak of others’ faults, or utter words that harm others.\"\n\nAnother said: \"The others may be possible, but the precept against stealing is difficult. Even in small matters, one already transgresses.\"\n\nThe transformed one said: \"Great matters may be difficult, but in small matters, is it not easy to be cautious?\" He then spoke a verse:\n\n*Why not receive the precept against stealing? Not receiving it is also difficult.*\n*Who says darkness conceals? Within, there is an official who records theft.*\n*Take one, and each year it doubles—doubling without end.*\n*With hands cupping molten bronze, it burns the mouth and boils the heart and liver.*\n*Once you speak of this suffering, for a whole year your heart still aches.*\n*Why not receive this precept and preserve it whole?*\n*I trust in it, and so may you—everywhere, there is no lack of peace.*\n*Sit in peace and summon the spirit-being; forever enjoy the joy of long years.*\n\nAnother said: \"All others may be easy, but the precept against lust is hardest to sever. Why? I have experienced this myself. Often, I followed my elder brother to partake of communal meals. During those meals, they would say that for one day, one should be diligent and not transgress principle, and that after death, one would surely gain the merit of such fasting and precepts. Yet when night came, what I pitied would cunningly approach, and though I bitterly restrained myself, before I knew it, I had already succumbed. This happened repeatedly, and so it is most difficult.\"\n\nThe transformed one said: \"Desire is merely a perception. All perceptions are empty—how can there be desire? First observe your own body and know that it has no marvel; then you will know there is no desire—how can you not endure? Moreover, indulgence in lust is like drinking salt water: the more you drink, the thirstier you become, until only death remains. Where is there satisfaction?\" Thereupon, he spoke a verse:\n\n*Desire is more severe than thirst; a little endurance may suffice to cross.*\n*Why advance toward salt water? The saltier the water, the more firmly thirst grips.*\n*If you can skillfully quench thirst, then drink the celestial sweet dew.*\n*Sweet dew is fragrant and aromatic, flowing through the body in every part.*\n*Heavenly beings follow the fragrance and descend; the profound mystery is naturally awakened.*\n*Joyful and free, forever without action, long preserve the blessing of the Nine Heavens.*\n\nAnother said: \"All others I can follow, but the precept against killing is difficult. My nature delights in watching cockfights. If I eat a meal without meat, it is utterly tasteless, and after several days, I grow thin.\"\n\nThe transformed one said: \"The worthy one regards fatness as a human affliction; leanness benefits the body’s lightness—what use is fat?\" He then spoke a verse:\n\n*The worthy one abstains from killing and also does not harbor the thought of killing.*\n*Though beings are small, they all delight in living and growing.*\n*How can you harm their lives to nourish yourself?*\n*This self-nourishment now is but a moment’s pleasure, yet it burdens you with natural clarity.*\n*Long sunk in the Three Wretched Realms, you suffer and are born again.*\n*Good and evil each have their causes, like an echo answering a call.*\n*Why not change this conduct and encourage yourself with a compassionate heart?*\n*The perfected one wanders with folded hands, carefree, observing the floating world.*\n\nAfter speaking this verse, the transformed one revealed his majestic and wondrous form as the Celestial Worthy, his attendants and retinue, and the grand music of the Celestial Realm—beyond what the eye could name—then returned to the upper realms. The youths all saw this, their joy and awe mingled, and having heard the essential teachings, their minds were opened and awakened. Together, they went to the Left Mysterious Perfected One to seek and receive the scriptures and all the Ten Precepts.\n\nThe Perfected One, too, with the eye of the Dao, saw the karmic causes of these youths from past lives, which had led to their difficulty in awakening, and how the Celestial Worthy had condescended to descend and, in many ways, open their understanding. Thus, he acted accordingly. Yet he did not immediately transmit the teachings to them, for though they had the karmic affinity, they could not yet sever all attachments. He only told them to return the next day for the transmission.\n\n\"Tomorrow, tomorrow\"—this went on without end. The youths said to one another: \"Our lives may not last another day. We cannot go on like this, always saying 'tomorrow.' We must each purify ourselves with fasting and sincerity, and together earnestly entreat him.\" They urged one another, saying: \"We will knock our heads to the ground until blood flows in bushels, yet we will not cease.\"",
      "overlap_context": " is like one who falls into hell—must they first create the laws of hell?\"\n\nThe celestial being praised it as excellent, saying: \"The words of the Sagely Worthy have awakened my foolish ignorance.\" Thereupon, he repented, expressed gratitude, and advanced one stage in immortality.\n\nAt that time, twelve youths, living in worldly ease and pleasure, gathered daily to prepare fine foods, drink heartily, and play in revelry. Sometimes, they would discuss the difficulty or ease of cultivating the Dao.",

They declared:\n\n\"We, the youths so-and-so and others, knock our heads in supplication for the Dao, beating ourselves in earnest. Today, the sun has already shifted its light; we constantly fear that our faint qi may suddenly fade into darkness, lost in endless night without dawn. Our solitary souls, trapped in suffering, have nowhere to seek deliverance.\n\nWe have heard that the Celestial Worthy expounds profound and subtle teachings, establishing the resolve of the steadfast—there are the Ten Precepts, concise in text yet essential in practice, encompassing all without omission. We, your humble disciples, earnestly aspire to receive them. Should we obtain them at dawn and perish by dusk, we would harbor no regrets for eternity. Yet if we delay further, day after day, our lives—fleeting as morning mushrooms—may not see tomorrow. Who knows what fortune or misfortune awaits?\n\nSuch a wondrous opportunity emerges but once in ten thousand generations. We have encountered it now, yet if we let it slip away, it would be like a blind man grasping a sparrow—once it flies from his hand, even after ten thousand kalpas, how could it ever be regained?
