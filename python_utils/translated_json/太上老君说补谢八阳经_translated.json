  "full_translation": "The *Scripture of the Most High Lord Lao on the Eight Yang Rites of Replenishment and Atonement*\n\nThus spake the Dao:\n\nThe Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water; the Sun and Moon and Five Planets; the Twenty-Eight Constellations; the Northern and Southern Dippers; the Five Soils and Eight Trigrams; the Twelve Earthly Deities of the Great Land; and the host of sages from the ten directions—all come to heed these words.\n\nLord Lao said: I observe that in the four quarters and three realms, across states, prefectures, cities, villages, and hamlets, whenever earth is broken for construction, dwellings are built, renovations are made, or old structures are replaced—whether in the east, west, south, or north, the four corners, above or below—after such works are completed, the people repeatedly suffer the Three Disasters and Nine Calamities, the Ten Afflictions and Eight Hardships. The qi of the earth flows unchecked, and the cycle of life and death deepens with each kalpa, offering no means of relief or atonement. Thus, I command the Generals of the Sun’s Wandering and Moon’s Slaying; the Year-Star’s Roaming Dragon and Crouching Dragon; the Celestial Slayers, Earthly Slayers, Year Slayers, Month Slayers, Day Slayers, and Hour Slayers; the Great Slayers, Lesser Slayers, Disaster Slayers, and Kalpa Slayers; the Six Jia and Six Spirits; the Twelve Celestial Deities and Twelve Earthly Hour-Deities; the Yellow Banner and Leopard-Tail Officials; the Talismans of Sickness, Death, and Misfortune; the Silkworm Officials, Silkworm Fates, Silkworm Chambers, and Memorial Petitions; the Great and Lesser Wastages; the Five Soils, Eight Trigrams, Gate Constables, and House Wardens; the Star Officials of the Year’s Fortune and Life’s Destiny; and the thousand and two hundred taboo deities above and below—all who have hitherto overseen or shall oversee the breaking of earth, construction, and renovations.\n\nFrom this day forth, let all who burn incense, uphold, and venerate this scripture, reciting it without cease, be forever free of taboos. The earth’s qi shall lie hidden, and universal harmony shall prevail. The land shall know peace, and weapons shall fall silent forever. Wind and rain shall come in due measure, the people shall dwell in safety, and all things shall thrive. All undertakings, whether by land or water, shall bring public and private benefit, and no unjust misfortunes shall arise. Households shall be harmonious, families at peace. Entering a dwelling shall bring great fortune, and perpetual radiance shall be received. Dragons and spirits shall offer protection, while malevolent ghosts shall vanish. Disasters shall dissolve, and misfortunes scatter. Blessings and prosperity shall abound, and all wishes shall be fulfilled. The world shall know great peace, and primordial auspiciousness shall be preserved forever. Sincere devotion shall be rewarded, and both humans and heavens shall uphold the law, revering it in accordance with the statutes.\n\nHere ends *The Scripture of the Most High Lord Lao on the Eight Yang Rites of Replenishment and Atonement*.",
