Attributed to the Orthodox Unity Perfected One, Zhang Ling, addressing his libationer disciples.\n**Volume:** One.\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Unity Section, First Subsection.\n\n---\n\nThe Celestial Master declares:\nThe Supreme Great Lord, the most revered spirit of Heaven, with the Left Supervisor Libationer as the Perfected One of Heaven, is accompanied on the left by one hundred and twenty scaled dragons and on the right by one hundred and twenty fierce tigers. Before him lead one hundred and twenty Vermilion Birds, and behind him follow one hundred and twenty Dark Warriors. Above his head rests a five-colored floral canopy, and beneath his feet lies the stellar pivot. Clad in robes of primordial *qi* and mysterious yellow, he roams the Gate of Life, his radiance equal to the sun and moon by day and night. Below, he governs the earthly deities; above, he aligns with the Northern Asterism. He commands tens of millions of stalwart youths and jade maidens, all bearing treasured swords and blades, piercing whatever obstructs them. They ride celestial stags, phoenixes, *qilin*, and scaled beasts, with *qiongqi* and apotropaic creatures in the hundreds, forming herds. Serpentine dragons and fierce beasts, numbering ninety-nine thousand, all possess the power of flight, moving without hindrance. They devour the essences of tens of millions of ghosts, ensuring no hundred evils dare approach recklessly. The Celestial Master’s divine incantation—*hasten, hasten, as in law and decree!*\n\nThe Celestial Master declares:\nThe Supreme Harmony and Mysterious Elder ride upon azure clouds and purple chariots, their canopy a jade maiden’s wheel, their carriage of water essence, its frame of gold and silver. Nine dragons draw them, their light illuminating all heavens. Clad in crimson and purple fur, their form is boundless and indistinct, their brilliance dazzling, their presence shaking all. They summon the hundred officials, the great river spirits, dragon kings, and ghost marshals, who hide among the clouds, kowtowing and striking their cheeks, pleading to present their cases. If their pleas are unheeded, they are delivered to the Warden of Prisons, bound in copper willows and iron locks, their throats clamped. The myriad evils tremble in terror, daring not approach recklessly. The edict commands the preparation of the divine kitchen, bestowing upon our true spirits. Now I shall summon the Spirit Lords, long concealed for ten billion years. Capture all blood-sacrificing and treacherous spirits, exhausting the world’s malevolent and aberrant folk. Those who spread heretical words, falsely claim divinity, slander the *Dao* and *qi*, or envy the worthy—all are demonic, deluding spirits. They practice deceit, distinguishing falsehood from truth. The Celestial Master, entrusted with the mandate, transforms the wicked into the good. The clang of pythons and serpents draws near, but rebellious harm is met with iron chains. Seize their heads, behead them thrice, and boil their bodies. *Qiongqi* and apotropaic beasts devour them relentlessly until all demonic rites are eradicated to their roots. Kinsmen and elders, do not approach! Receive my divine incantation—do not advance! *Swiftly, swiftly, as in law and decree!*\n\nThe Celestial Master declares:\nI eradicate the ten thousand calamities of Heaven and Earth, transforming in the mortal realm to become the Ghost King. My body stands sixteen feet tall, my head square, my teeth of copper and iron, biting sharp blades. In my hands, I wield cleavers and grindstones, bearing cauldrons of boiling liquid. My movements summon thunder and lightning, reversing the light of Heaven. The stars lose their course, the moon pales in sorrow. Whirlwinds uproot the earth, the sun withdraws its light. Grass and trees wither, forests collapse. Mountains crumble, rocks split, river bridges shatter. Chariots carry iron locks and silver chains, with three proclamations and six incantations issued each month. I recruit the hundred ghosts, urging them to be diligent and mighty. Once captured, they are slain to eliminate misfortune. Who dares oppose my divine incantation? Flee a thousand miles, lest you incur calamity! *Hasten, hasten, as in law and decree!*\n\nThe Celestial Master declares:\nI ascended Mount Tai to pay homage to the Yellow and Venerable Lord, who taught me the language of slaying ghosts. As soon as my spirit ascends, I summon the Jade Maidens to capture misfortune and ascend to Heaven. On my left, I bear the contract and seal; on my head, the floral canopy; beneath my feet, the stellar pivot. To my left, the Six *Jia* spirits; to my right, the Six *Ding* spirits. Before me stands the Yellow Spirit; behind me, the *Yuezhang*. The divine master executes punishments without flinching from the mighty. First, the evil spirits are slain; next, the wandering lights are extinguished. What spirit dares approach? What ghost dares oppose? Bind you and cast you into water, boil you in cauldrons. Flogged once every three days, beaten once every five. The Gate Warden seizes and binds you; the Jade Maidens torture you. My officers receive the indictment; the Hearth Lord submits the memorial. So-and-so is without guilt or fault, must not afflict the worthy and good. I utter the incantation of Heaven and Earth’s *qi*, the venomous curse against the ghostly realm. Curse gold, and it melts of itself; curse wood, and it snaps of itself; curse water, and it dries of itself; curse fire, and it extinguishes of itself; curse mountains, and they crumble of themselves; curse stones, and they split of themselves; curse spirits, and they bind themselves; curse ghosts, and they slay themselves; curse prayers, and they sever themselves; curse paralysis, and it resolves of itself; curse poison, and it scatters of itself; curse curses, and they perish of themselves. The Celestial Master’s divine incantation arrives—none may defy it! Flee a thousand miles! *Hasten, hasten, as in law and decree!*\n\nThe Celestial Master declares:\nI am the Master of Heaven and Earth, driving out evil like wind and rain. In my left hand, I grasp the Azure Dragon; in my right, I hold the White Tiger. Before my chest is the Vermilion Bird; upon my back, the Dark Warrior. Above my head are the immortals; beneath my feet, the jade maidens. In my hands, the Three Generals; my ten fingers serve as marshals. The Merit Officers command the binding, delivering them beneath the stellar pivot. They linger between the Three Terraces, the Five Stars all seized. Roaming the Palace of the Floral Canopy, they pass directly beneath the Gate of Heaven. The edict is issued to the府 of Mount Tai, including all envoys, to capture the treacherous and evil ghosts, the demonic and chaotic spirits. Execute the deceitful and false, exposing their corpses by the roadside. The Censor ascends to the Celestial Bureau, now submitting the report. The Celestial Master’s divine incantation arrives—*hasten, hasten, as in law and decree!*\n\nI humbly invoke the Five Lords of the Plain Chariot and White Horse, with one hundred thousand soldiers, to seize the ghosts of the three mounds and five tombs within such-and-such a household’s residence.\n\nI humbly invoke the Five Lords of *Qi*-Conveyance, with one hundred thousand soldiers, to seize the ghosts of the one hundred and twenty executions and slayings within such-and-such a household’s residence.\n\nI humbly invoke the Five Lords of the Central Bureau, with one hundred thousand soldiers, to seize the hundred spirits and myriad evils within such-and-such a household’s residence.\n\nI humbly invoke the Five Lords of Investigation and Summons, with one hundred thousand soldiers, to seize the ghosts of the deceased officials and residual *qi* within such-and-such a household’s residence.\n\nI humbly invoke the Five Lords of the Household Guardians, with one hundred thousand soldiers, to seize the ghosts of exorcised evils and thieves within such-and-such a household’s residence.\n\nI humbly invoke the Five Lords of the Broad Bureau, with one hundred thousand soldiers, to seize the ghosts of the twelve months’ destructive *qi* within such-and-such a household’s residence.\n\nI humbly invoke the Five Lords of the Northern City’s Mandate and Strategy, with one hundred thousand soldiers, to seize the ghosts of the northern hour’s dominant *qi* within such-and-such a household’s residence.\n\nI humbly invoke the One Thousand Two Hundred Attendant Censors and Two Hundred Official Generals, with one hundred thousand soldiers, to seize the ghosts of the five directions’ pestilential *qi* that harms people within such-and-such a household’s residence.\n\nI humbly invoke the Five Lords of the Supreme Great Harmony, with one hundred thousand soldiers, to seize the one hundred and twenty malevolent spirits and deviant *qi* within such-and-such a household’s residence.\n\nThe Heavenly Master declares: Those who wish to practice the Daoist arts, cultivate the body and refine conduct, heal illnesses and alleviate suffering, seek longevity and extended years, escape disasters and calamities, ascend to heaven in broad daylight, secure peace for their households, ensure prosperity in fields and silkworms, gain profit in trade, maintain order among servants, attain high office and promotion, prevail in legal disputes, prolong the lives of men and women, safeguard descendants, or protect pregnant women—today, I specially invoke the Ten Bureaus of the Central Bureau, the *qi* of the Upright Center, the Attendant Censors, the Lords of the Plain Chariot and White Horse, the Lords of the Northern City’s Mandate, the Heavenly Supervisors of Rebellion, the Lords of the Broad Bureau, the Lords of the Supreme Mystery, and the *qi* of the Great Harmony—one thousand two hundred in all, each with five generals, to encamp in the central courtyard of such-and-such a household. With weapons facing outward, they shall monitor and inspect the residual *qi* of deceased officials within and without, the ghosts of blood sacrifices, the spirits of heretical delusions, the myriad evils and countless spirits, the *qi* of corpses, earth spirits and earth toxins, the *qi* of construction—whether building homes, erecting pillars, cultivating gardens, repairing dwellings, damaging houses, relocating wells and stoves, disturbing doors and gates, mending fences, securing curtains and walls, digging wells and cellars, or filling holes—all works high and low, all destructive *qi* of ruin, shall be slain and seized. Together, they shall capture the Five Remnants and Six Thieves, the twelve heretical delusions, the male and female [omitted], the misfortunes of past generations, the cursed corpses, the residual *qi* of exorcised evils, lingering calamities, malevolent spirits, borrowed ghosts and jealous *qi*, the Five Deficiencies and Six Wastes, the twelve curses, the wild paths of dreams and waking visions, the inverted officials, the slander and betrayal, the harm to inner and outer kin, the deaths of ancestors and descendants, the linked fates of men and women, the innocent ghosts, the ghosts of those who died away from home, those slain in war, those who died by celestial omens, those who died by curses, the ghosts of those who died before and after, the ghosts of timely curses, and all manner of strange phenomena—owls, crows, magpies, and other birds crying in vain; dogs howling in ominous ways; the *qi* of blood light, golden light, fire light, water light, wood light, clothing light, and hair light; the strange sounds of doors and gates opening and closing; the spirits of pots wailing and cauldrons moaning; the *qi* of iron and metal; the *qi* of celestial wasps, green flies, insects, snakes, wild beasts, foxes, the six livestock, and the five poisons—all that lurk in the household and refuse to depart. I reverently implore the Supreme One to command the Heavenly Bureau to execute them according to the incantation, in accordance with the Ghost Laws of the Dark Capital. They shall not dare to disobey the Heavenly Master’s divine incantation. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\n\nYour servant respectfully petitions the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Venerable Lord, the Supreme Elder, the Heavenly Master, the Lineage Masters, and the Masters of Transmission, along with the officials, generals, and soldiers under the jurisdiction of the Petition Bureau. I, your servant, bow my head and prostrate myself, addressing the Twenty-Four Lords of the Six *Zhi*, Six *Zhi* (Upright), Six *Duan*, and Six *Yin*. In this degenerate age, as the kalpa nears its end, the people have grown wicked and rebellious, their habits long corrupted. Outwardly, they feign goodness, but inwardly, they harbor the hearts of wolves. They seek only to do evil, never considering acts of kindness. Their words and faces contradict one another, scheming together in deceit. Among ten thousand, is there even one who seeks the Way of life? Their hearts brim with malice, jealousy, and heresy, all leading to death. They indulge in lust and excess, pursue glory and rank, despise the orphaned and poor, bully the weak, pit ruler against minister, father against son, brother against brother, mother against daughter, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law, husband against wife, and even kin against kin, sparing not even their closest relatives. Thus, the *qi* of the Dao no longer shelters them, and the heavens unleash disasters across the nine provinces. White bones stretch for a thousand miles, and even the virtuous are scarcely spared. Such people, arrogant and stubborn, abduct and sell women to serve as concubines—five or six above, three or four below. With carriages, horses, robes, and furs, they live in opulence, indulging their desires without restraint. They rush about, heedless of age or youth, practicing heretical arts and consulting wicked masters. They bind and curse one another, sometimes capturing a person’s likeness or invoking their name, entrusting them to earth gods and kitchen stoves, or to rivers and springs, inflicting pain in every possible way. With fragrant offerings and fine cakes, they beseech the Lords of Fate, seeking to make men and women despise others and love only themselves, to turn their hearts and cling to shadows, finding joy in such perversions. Through seasonal sacrifices, they embrace wild paths. Though they may profit in the moment, calamity awaits them and their descendants. They consume the children of others, and it shall consume them in turn, destroying their households and extending misfortune to future generations. Such heretical practices must not persist.\n\nI, your servant, expose these evils and submit this memorial, entrusting my fate to the Supreme Lords of the Three Heavens. I humbly beseech the Supreme One to command the Heavenly Bureau to dispatch the divine soldiers of the Six *Jia* Generals and Six *Ding* Gods, to slay the *qi* of wild paths according to the incantation, eradicate deceit, and uphold the Supreme Decree. Let the Great Dao’s righteous law empower the officials and soldiers to assist me in this campaign, annihilating them at once, in accordance with the Ghost Laws of the Dark Capital. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\n\nThe Celestial Master declares: Today’s *jia* pierces the coercion of wild paths; today’s *yi* severs the eruption of wild paths; today’s *bing* severs the shadow of wild paths; today’s *ding* severs the form of wild paths; today’s *xu* severs the hands of wild paths; today’s *si* severs the spleen of wild paths; today’s *geng* severs the liver of wild paths; today’s *xin* severs the lungs of wild paths; today’s *ren* severs the heart of wild paths; today’s *gui* severs the tail of wild paths. Slay the wild paths unto death—three in Heaven, five on Earth—none may dwell where they are not the master’s kin. I wield the divine incantation: swiftly depart! Go to the rivers and seas, where the *Qiongqi* beast wards off evil, and the *Xianchi* Pool devours the flesh of wild paths, consuming their skins. If you do not hasten away, you shall die. By the Heavenly Marshal’s divine incantation: swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\n\nThe Celestial Master declares: Today’s six *yi*, the wild paths must flee; six *bing* and six *ding*, the wild paths self-punish; six *wu* and six *ji*, the wild paths cannot rise; six *geng* and six *xin*, the wild paths lose their power; six *ren* and six *gui*, the wild paths die by their own hand. The Six *Jia* Generals and Six *Ding* Gods shall slay the wild paths, barring them from approaching mankind. By the Celestial Master’s divine incantation: swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\n\nThe Celestial Master declares: Today’s *yin* and *shen*, the wild paths lose their power; today’s *mao* and *you*, the wild paths forfeit their longevity; today’s *chen* and *xu*, the wild paths must flee; today’s *wei* and *chou*, the wild paths shall not endure. By the Celestial Master’s divine incantation: swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\n\nThe Celestial Master declares: Five *yin* and five *mao* slay the wild paths; five *chen* and five *si* slay the wives and children of wild paths; five *wu* and five *wei* slay the heretical demons and malevolent spirits of wild paths; five *shen* and five *you* slay the parents of wild paths; five *xu* and five *hai* consign the wild paths to the sea; five *zi* and five *chou* slay the chieftains of wild paths. By the Celestial Master’s divine incantation: swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\n\nThe Celestial Master declares: Today’s *jia-chen*, the wild paths lose their power; today’s *jia-xu*, the wild paths must all depart; today’s *yi-geng*, the wild paths cannot advance; today’s *bing-xin*, the wild paths perish; today’s *ding-ren*, the hearts of wild paths are shattered; today’s *wu-gui*, the wild paths are slain unto death; today’s *jia-si*, the wild paths are executed in the marketplace. By the Celestial Master’s divine incantation: swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\n\nThe Celestial Master declares: In the East, the wild paths are the Azure Dragon’s flood-dragons; in the South, the wild paths are the dazzling flames of wildfire; in the West, the wild paths are the roaring White Tigers; in the North, the wild paths are the swaying tails of the Dark Warriors; in the Center, the wild paths are the Yellow Emperor, who drinks your blood. Your blood flows, your poison departs! I know your names: the Great Spirit of the Northern Sea is called *Xianzhuang*, his body three *zhang* in length, his head three *chi* long, his teeth of curved gold like chisels, his face three *chi* broad, his forehead and neck pure white. He devours three thousand at dawn and eight hundred at dusk. If the wild paths are not eradicated, he shall hunt them down. By the Celestial Master’s divine incantation: swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\n\nThe Supreme One mobilizes the *qi* of the Deliverer from Distress, a host of one million;\nThe Most High Supreme Center Lord, thirty-six hundred strong;\n\nThe Most High Nine Emperor Lords, three hundred ten thousand strong;\nThe Supreme Great Harmony Lord’s officials and generals, the Nine Palaces and Twelve Camps, the guardians of all heavens and the void—great and small, all the people—if afflicted by illness and suffering, report to the disciples, the Grand Unity, the Supreme Mystery, the Primordial *Qi*, the thirty myriad myriad libationers of all states. Now this document lists the names of all families within the Middle Kingdom, to be executed by name. Should any dwell as mountain ghosts or forest ghosts, grass ghosts or tree ghosts, tomb ghosts or grave ghosts, household ghosts or strangers’ ghosts, waterside ghosts or roadside ghosts, inner ghosts or outer ghosts, feasting ghosts or sleeping ghosts, the blue, red, yellow, white, and black five-colored ghosts—whether tall ghosts or short ghosts, great earth ghosts or petty ghosts, cunning ghosts or dream-haunting ghosts, morning-rising ghosts or night-wandering ghosts, walking ghosts or flying ghosts, questioning ghosts or calling ghosts, harming ghosts, wrathful ghosts, swift-moving ghosts or plague-spreading poisonous ghosts, the Five Pestilence ghosts or flesh-picking ghosts—recite the urgent incantation, and the ghosts shall shatter and perish of themselves.\n\nThe Orthodox Unity Perfected Person declares to all libationers and disciples: if one can receive this scripture, when stricken by sudden headaches, dizziness, chills, or fever, read this scripture constantly, and demonic illusions shall crumble, daring not face our incantation. If beset by official imprisonment, flood, or fire, read this scripture. If ghosts dwell within the home, read this scripture. When invoking the names of the Primordial Lords, recite this scripture. Should any towering, vast, and boundless ghosts or spirits torment the world, oppressing the people with cruelty, spreading disease, pestilence, or *qi* as ghosts—whether foreign ghosts, brooding ghosts, infirm ghosts, *wangliang* ghosts, deluding ghosts, wandering ghosts, binding ghosts, curse-ghosts, lingering corpse ghosts, plague-dead ghosts, lewd-dead ghosts, aged-dead ghosts, palace ghosts, lodging ghosts, military camp ghosts, prison-dead ghosts, market-dead ghosts, startling ghosts, wood-dead ghosts, fire-dead ghosts, drowned ghosts, client ghosts, unburied ghosts, roadside ghosts, war-dead ghosts, star-dead ghosts, blood-dead ghosts, beseeching ghosts, beheaded ghosts, hanged ghosts, offended ghosts, self-stabbing ghosts, terrifying ghosts, violent-dead ghosts, two-headed ghosts, riding ghosts, chariot-driving ghosts, mountain ghosts, spirit ghosts, earth ghosts, mountaintop ghosts, water ghosts, bridge-dwelling ghosts, road ghosts, Qiang and Hu ghosts, Man and Yi ghosts, taboo ghosts, insect-disturbing ghosts, essence ghosts, hundred-insect ghosts, well, stove, pond, and marsh ghosts, myriad-path ghosts, concealing ghosts, unspiritual ghosts, or impostor ghosts—\n\nAll great and small spirits and ghosts shall not afflict the bodies of any household’s men or women. Should ghosts defy the incantation, their heads shall split into ten parts, their bodies and heads ground to pulp. Recite this scripture, invoke the ghosts’ names, and illness shall be dispelled, all endeavors shall prosper. The merit of this scripture, the sacred power, is beyond measure. Thereupon, all libationers and disciples gazed in awe at the numinous text, reverently received its teachings, and vowed to uphold it, bowing their heads in retreat.\n\nHere ends the *Supreme Orthodox Unity Scripture for Cursing Ghosts*.",

Above my head are the immortals; beneath my feet, the jade maidens. In my hands, the Three Generals; my ten fingers serve as marshals. The Merit Officers command the binding, delivering them beneath the stellar pivot. They linger between the Three Terraces, the Five Stars all seized. Roaming the Palace of the Floral Canopy, they pass directly beneath the Gate of Heaven. The edict is issued to the府 of Mount Tai, including all envoys, to capture the treacherous and evil ghosts, the demonic and chaotic spirits. Execute the deceitful and false, exposing their corpses by the roadside. The Censor ascends to the Celestial Bureau, now submitting the report. The Celestial Master’s divine incantation arrives—*hasten, hasten, as in law and decree!*\n\nI humbly invoke the Five Lords of the Plain Chariot and White Horse, with one hundred thousand soldiers, to seize the ghosts of the three mounds and five tombs within such-and-such a household’s residence.\n\nI humbly invoke the Five Lords of *Qi*-Conveyance, with one hundred thousand soldiers, to seize the ghosts of the one hundred and twenty executions and slayings within such-and-such a household’s residence.\n\nI humbly invoke the Five Lords of the Central Bureau, with one hundred thousand soldiers, to seize the hundred spirits and myriad evils within such-and-such a household’s residence.\n\nI humbly invoke the Five Lords of Investigation and Summons, with one hundred thousand soldiers, to seize the ghosts of the deceased officials and residual *qi* within such-and-such a household’s residence.",

With weapons facing outward, they shall monitor and inspect the residual *qi* of deceased officials within and without, the ghosts of blood sacrifices, the spirits of heretical delusions, the myriad evils and countless spirits, the *qi* of corpses, earth spirits and earth toxins, the *qi* of construction—whether building homes, erecting pillars, cultivating gardens, repairing dwellings, damaging houses, relocating wells and stoves, disturbing doors and gates, mending fences, securing curtains and walls, digging wells and cellars, or filling holes—all works high and low, all destructive *qi* of ruin, shall be slain and seized. Together, they shall capture the Five Remnants and Six Thieves, the twelve heretical delusions, the male and female [omitted], the misfortunes of past generations, the cursed corpses, the residual *qi* of exorcised evils, lingering calamities, malevolent spirits, borrowed ghosts and jealous *qi*, the Five Deficiencies and Six Wastes, the twelve curses, the wild paths of dreams and waking visions, the inverted officials, the slander and betrayal, the harm to inner and outer kin, the deaths of ancestors and descendants, the linked fates of men and women, the innocent ghosts, the ghosts of those who died away from home, those slain in war, those who died by celestial omens, those who died by curses, the ghosts of those who died before and after, the ghosts of timely curses, and all manner of strange phenomena—owls, crows, magpies, and other birds crying in vain; dogs howling in ominous ways; the *qi* of blood light, golden light, fire light, water light, wood light, clothing light, and hair light; the strange sounds of doors and gates opening and closing; the spirits of pots wailing and cauldrons moaning; the *qi* of iron and metal; the *qi* of celestial wasps, green flies, insects, snakes, wild beasts, foxes, the six livestock, and the five poisons—all that lurk in the household and refuse to depart. I reverently implore the Supreme One to command the Heavenly Bureau to execute them according to the incantation, in accordance with the Ghost Laws of the Dark Capital. They shall not dare to disobey the Heavenly Master’s divine incantation. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\n\nYour servant respectfully petitions the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Venerable Lord, the Supreme Elder, the Heavenly Master, the Lineage Masters, and the Masters of Transmission, along with the officials, generals, and soldiers under the jurisdiction of the Petition Bureau. I, your servant, bow my head and prostrate myself, addressing the Twenty-Four Lords of the Six *Zhi*, Six *Zhi* (Upright), Six *Duan*, and Six *Yin*. In this degenerate age, as the kalpa nears its end, the people have grown wicked and rebellious, their habits long corrupted. Outwardly, they feign goodness, but inwardly, they harbor the hearts of wolves. They seek only to do evil, never considering acts of kindness. Their words and faces contradict one another, scheming together in deceit. Among ten thousand, is there even one who seeks the Way of life? Their hearts brim with malice, jealousy, and heresy, all leading to death. They indulge in lust and excess, pursue glory and rank, despise the orphaned and poor, bully the weak, pit ruler against minister, father against son, brother against brother, mother against daughter, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law, husband against wife, and even kin against kin, sparing not even their closest relatives. Thus, the *qi* of the Dao no longer shelters them, and the heavens unleash disasters across the nine provinces. White bones stretch for a thousand miles, and even the virtuous are scarcely spared. Such people, arrogant and stubborn, abduct and sell women to serve as concubines—five or six above, three or four below. With carriages, horses, robes, and furs, they live in opulence, indulging their desires without restraint. They rush about, heedless of age or youth, practicing heretical arts and consulting wicked masters. They bind and curse one another, sometimes capturing a person’s likeness or invoking their name, entrusting them to earth gods and kitchen stoves, or to rivers and springs, inflicting pain in every possible way. With fragrant offerings and fine cakes, they beseech the Lords of Fate, seeking to make men and women despise others and love only themselves, to turn their hearts and cling to shadows, finding joy in such perversions. Through seasonal sacrifices, they embrace wild paths. Though they may profit in the moment, calamity awaits them and their descendants. They consume the children of others, and it shall consume them in turn, destroying their households and extending misfortune to future generations. Such heretical practices must not persist.\n\nI, your servant, expose these evils and submit this memorial, entrusting my fate to the Supreme Lords of the Three Heavens. I humbly beseech the Supreme One to command the Heavenly Bureau to dispatch the divine soldiers of the Six *Jia* Generals and Six *Ding* Gods, to slay the *qi* of wild paths according to the incantation, eradicate deceit, and uphold the Supreme Decree. Let the Great Dao’s righteous law empower the officials and soldiers to assist me in this campaign, annihilating them at once, in accordance with the Ghost Laws of the Dark Capital.
