  "full_translation": "**The Esoteric Arts of Penetrating the Mysteries**\n\n**Title:** *Esoteric Arts of Penetrating the Mysteries*\nCompiled by Shen Zhiyan of the Tang dynasty. One fascicle.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* section, *Zhongshu* category.\n\n**Preface to *Esoteric Arts of Penetrating the Mysteries***\nThe foundation of a person’s existence lies in cultivating the Dao and refining techniques, with strengthening the body as the foremost priority. In the vigor of youth, who considers the decline of later years? Humanity, endowed with the nobility of the Three Powers, possesses a round head and square feet, perfectly mirroring the forms of Heaven and Earth—one must not neglect or squander this gift.\n\nIn my early years, I, Zhiyan, devoted my heart to the Dao. In the first year of the Taihe era, while serving in the Bureau of Documents, I encountered the Daoist Master Ma Ziran, who imparted to me secret formulas and the *Mysterious Elixir of Free Will*, along with the *Five Methods of Liberation*. Though I was but a humble and unlearned man, unable to fathom the profound mysteries, I often inquired among the world of men. Through the practices of *caibu* and life extension, I occasionally grasped fragments of their essence.\n\nIn the spring of the fifth year of the Xiantong era, while in Huainan, my old friend, Lord Zheng of Rongyang, revealed to me the secret essentials of various divine elixirs. These were all methods for aiding the world, treating all manner of illnesses among people, and prolonging life—techniques for subduing the Five Metals and Eight Stones, transmuting and transforming, warding off cold and heat, and abstaining from grains. Even for arrowheads lodged deep in the flesh for years, when anointed with this elixir, they would emerge of their own accord, demonstrating the divine efficacy of transformation, as recorded within these three fascicles. Later scholars of the Dao who peruse these texts will surely find their minds enlightened and their eyes astonished.\n\nThe methods for refining *huohuo* minerals and divine elixirs are all contained herein. I, Zhiyan, have arranged and compiled them into three fascicles—upper, middle, and lower—entitled *Esoteric Arts of Penetrating the Mysteries*, to present to those of like aspiration. The root of nurturing life is to be shared with fellow seekers; I only ask that it not be lightly transmitted.\n\n**Compiled by Shen Zhiyan, a commoner of Jineshan**\n**Zheng’s Three-Life Elixir**\n\n**Fire-Refined Cinnabar**\n**Fire-Refined Northern Borax**\n**Fire-Refined Borneol**\nThe above three ingredients, each one and a half *liang*, are ground together into a fine powder, mixed with fermented water until moist, dried in the sun, and then ground again.\n\n**Magnetite**, one *liang* (select those that strongly attract needles, quench in vinegar, and grind into powder)\n**Stalactite**, one *liang* (finely ground)\n**Red Halloysite**, three *liang* (select those that adhere to the tongue, finely ground)\n\nPlace all ingredients into a jar, dry according to method, and set the jar in an ash furnace, burying it in ash up to three *cun*. Apply two *jin* of fire to thoroughly heat it, then increase the fire to ten *jin*, gradually intensifying until the jar glows red for the duration of a meal. When the elixir is ready, immerse the jar in water, break the lid with an iron spoon, and rinse until cool before opening. The surface of the elixir will be white, while the interior shines with a purple-golden luster. Grind it with a spoon into a fine powder, place it on clean paper in a pure space, and cover it with a basin for a day to dispel the fire toxin. Then form it into pills the size of small beans with millet gruel. Take three pills on an empty stomach with water to neutralize all poisons. If someone has been poisoned, administer it in wine or food.\n\nIt treats heart and abdominal pain, *chuanshi* disease, foul armpits, malign *qi*, perverse *qi*, and demonic *qi* attacking the heart. Mix three *qian* of the elixir powder with vinegar and consume—divinely effective.\n\n*Chuanshi* is a malignant disease where, regardless of family size, one person dies and transmits it to another, potentially annihilating the entire clan. Those fortunate enough to encounter this elixir and consume it will find that once one person is cured, the disease will not spread further. The illness manifests as acute consumption with yellowing and emaciation.\n\nFor suppurating carbuncles on the back with unceasing pus and blood, regardless of whether the sore is above or below the heart, mix the elixir powder with vinegar and spread it evenly on thin paper, applying it to the sore according to its size. Change the dressing every other day while also taking the elixir pills. After three to five applications, the sore will gradually contract and heal. Avoid all toxic foods. Once the pus and blood cease, recovery will follow within ten to fifteen days.\n\nFor piercing pain in the head or face, or dizziness and wind in the head, take three *qian* of the powder mixed with vinegar to permanently eradicate the root cause. If one has previously consumed sulfur or *shifanshi* and suffers from toxin outbreaks, taking two pills will yield immediate results. This elixir is the sovereign of all medicines, and the condition will not recur thereafter.\n\nWhen refining mineral elixirs, many fail to dispel the fire toxin before forming pills or powders. After consumption, if one neglects proper rest and recuperation, the fire toxin will manifest. However, if the fire toxin is first expelled before preparation, it will never arise.\n\nFor *sanyin* disease, take the elixir with *huanglian* decoction, or form pills with *huanglian* powder for consumption. For yin jaundice and back swelling, take three *qian* with tea to halt the condition. Back swelling is a precursor to carbuncles.\n\nFor mouth sores, mix the elixir with honey and apply to the tongue. For red and white vaginal discharge, take it mixed with wine. For arrowheads lodged in the flesh from battle, grind *bi li* vine roots into juice, mix with the elixir, and apply to the wound—the arrowhead will emerge on its own.\n\nFor women suffering from wind pain after childbirth or unbearable *qi* and blood surging into the heart, take three *qian* mixed with vinegar and wine to provide relief. For itching from lacquer sores, wash with lotus leaf decoction, then apply the elixir powder to heal.\n\nFor all poisonous insect bites, epilepsy, and heart disturbances caused by evil influences, grind rhinoceros horn into water and take three *qian* of the elixir. For uncontrolled vomiting of blood, take as directed for divine efficacy.\n\n**Azure-Blossom Elixir**\n**Azurite**, one *liang* (ground)\n**Lead White**, one *liang*\n**White Halloysite**, half a *liang*\n**Bright Cinnabar**, half a *liang*\n**Salt Blossom**\n**Peach-Blossom Stone**, each half a *liang* (if unavailable, substitute with magnetite)\n\nGrind all ingredients into a fine powder and place them in a jar. Cover the top with salt blossom and seal it securely, allowing it to dry. Apply one to two *liang* of fire around the jar, gradually moving closer until the heat penetrates all sides. Then place a *cheng* of charcoal fire around it, allowing the fire to consume itself for the duration of a meal. If the jar begins to boil, wait a short while before stopping.\n\nOnce cooled completely, open the jar and remove the medicine, then pound it to break it apart. Perform water levigation to remove the saltiness, dry it thoroughly, and add a small amount of musk. Grind them together, then form into pills with cooked rice, each the size of a sesame seed. Take five pills daily on an empty stomach with wine, avoiding sheep’s blood and cold water. This elixir treats cholera, abdominal distension with cold qi, infantile malnutrition, malnutrition-induced intestinal wind, and all cold disorders in women’s blood and qi. With prolonged use, its effects are wondrous.\n\n**Sun-Flowing Pearl Elixir**\n**Sun Mineral**, one *jin*\n**Niter**, four *liang*\n**Salt Blossom**, four *liang* (stir-fried until smoke dissipates)\n**Northern Borax**, three *liang*\n\nGrind the four ingredients into a fine powder and pack tightly into a jar. Cover the top with a thin layer of stir-fried salt to expel yin qi, then seal as directed. Place the jar inside a crucible. First, melt half a *jin* of lead and pour it into the jar, securing it with an iron rod. Then melt additional lead and pour it into the crucible until the jar is submerged. Seal thoroughly, place in an ash furnace, and maintain a fire to keep the lead half-molten, using the lead as an indicator. After one hundred days, remove the jar from the crucible. For three more days, maintain a fire of five to six *liang*, increasing the heat daily until the contents turn red, then stop. Once cooled, remove the substance—now amber in color—soak it in cold spring water to remove fire toxin, grind finely, and form into pills with jujube pulp, each the size of a mung bean. Take two pills daily on an empty stomach with tea. This elixir dispels all chronic cold wind, abdominal masses, congealed blood in women, red and white vaginal discharge, intestinal wind with bloody stool, long-standing qi-induced dysentery, cold rashes, clear-water vomiting, acid reflux, and all other ailments—all are cured by it.\n\n**Yellow Court Elixir**\n**Sulfur**, one *liang*\n**Northern Borax**, one *liang* (ground together into a fine powder)\n\nPlace the mixture into a small container, seal as directed, and place in an ash furnace. Maintain a constant fire of four *liang* for seven days, then move the container to the furnace’s base for one additional day. Remove and observe: the Sun Mineral should be on top, the Northern Borax below. Grind them together again, return to the container, and repeat the process for another seven days, followed by one day at the base. Then stop. Upon removal, if the Sun Mineral is no longer on top, it has been subdued by fire. Mix with wax, boil to remove fire toxin (the wax will turn black as lacquer), then remove the wax and dry. Grind finely and form into pills with cooked rice, each the size of a millet grain. Take two pills daily on an empty stomach with wine or vinegar decoction. This elixir breaks up chronic blood and qi stagnation in women, lightens the body, and strengthens vitality. After taking it, no illnesses will arise. The pill resides in the *dantian* within the body; after ten or five years, if injury from a fall or blow causes lingering pain, recite: *\"I once consumed a divine elixir, and now this pain arises within me—let it be healed.\"* Have another person massage the affected area until a fiery sensation moves within the flesh to the painful spot, whereupon the pain will cease. Such is the miraculous efficacy of this elixir—its merits cannot be fully described.\n\n**Canopy Elixir**\n**Black Lead**, three *jin* (use only the finest, hammered into square chimes, pierced with iron rods, and strung with cord)\n\nTake a clean jar and fill it with one *dou* of rice vinegar. Suspend the lead pieces inside, ensuring they remain one *cun* above the vinegar, then seal the jar tightly with paper. Every seven days, open the jar to replace the lead pieces, scraping off the frost onto clean paper with a small bamboo spatula or bird feather, then return the lead to the jar. After three or four cycles, replace the lead pieces, as their potency weakens. For every *liang* of lead frost, add half a *fen* of borneol, grind into a fine powder, and form into pills with dew water, each the size of a firmiana seed. Before sleep each night, hold one pill in the mouth and lie down without speaking, allowing it to dissolve naturally. This elixir transforms hair: if not yet white, taking it every other day ensures it will never whiten; if already white, after twenty days of use, pluck the white hairs, and black ones will grow in their place. Within sixty to one hundred pills, temples and hair will turn deep black, lustrous as lacquer. In some cases, two black hairs may sprout from a single follicle where a white one was plucked. This elixir is rare in the world, transmitted from the golden mouth of an immortal. With prolonged use, it preserves youthful complexion—at fifty, one’s appearance may resemble a child’s. It also dispels heat toxin, wind, and pain in sinews and bones.\n\nOne must abstain from garlic for life.\n\n**Purple-Gold Elixir**\nRefined Northern Court saltpeter: five taels (ground separately, added last to the medicinal mixture)\nFresh rehmannia: ten catties (crushed, pressed to extract juice)\nApricot kernels: five sheng (tips and skins removed, ground)\nGold Prefecture pepper: half a catty\nSichuan aconite: half a catty (roasted, skin removed, weighed)\n\nGrind all the above ingredients—except the rehmannia juice—into fine powder. Place the rehmannia juice in a cauldron (a silver pot is best). Use approximately one catty of charcoal, banking the fire with ash on all sides, and simmer slowly; avoid intense heat. Add the medicinal powder, stirring three hundred times with a willow-wood spatula, then incorporate the Northern Court saltpeter, stirring continuously without pause. When the mixture thickens sufficiently, form pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take one to ten pills daily on an empty stomach, washed down with wine. After ingestion, wait a while before eating rice to aid absorption. Women may also take this elixir. Avoid mutton blood. Pregnant women must not consume it. This elixir specifically treats the five taxations and seven injuries in men, as well as all cold diseases and wind-qi disorders. With prolonged use, it whitens the beard, preserves youthful complexion, extends lifespan, and strengthens bones—truly a divine and efficacious elixir.\n\n**Yellow-Flourish Elixir**\nJade fragments: one tael\nArsenolite: one tael (boiled in one sheng of vinegar until dry)\nLitharge: one tael\nFrankincense: one tael\nHuman fecal frost: one tael (dried; place in a ceramic vessel, heat with charcoal until glowing red, then cover with another vessel until cool; do not allow it to turn to ash before removing)\n\nGrind all ingredients into fine powder. Heat half a sheng of aged, high-quality rice vinegar, melt the frankincense in it, then add the mixture. Mix with powdered Cold-Food Festival steamed cake, grinding repeatedly until it forms a paste. Blend with refined honey to form pills the size of black soybeans. This elixir specifically treats cold-qi heart pain and women’s blood-qi heart disorders. Take one pill on an empty stomach with vinegar broth; symptoms will subside momentarily. For chronic conditions, take one pill daily on an empty stomach for up to twenty doses—all ailments will be cured. For women with deep-seated heart disorders, thirty pills will ensure lifelong freedom from recurrence. Pregnant women must not take this elixir, as it may harm the fetus. Avoid mutton blood and poisonous fish.\n\n**Yin-Concealing Purple-Gold Elixir**\nSulfur: five taels (crushed, ground, and water-floated)\nSalt flowers: one sheng\n\nSpread half a sheng of salt flowers in a small, flat-bottomed cauldron, layer the sulfur powder atop it, then cover with the remaining salt. Seal the cauldron with a ceramic lid, ensuring water submerges the mixture by about two inches. Seal the edges with damp paper. Maintain a gentle fire, keeping the water at a fish-eye boil for seven days and nights without allowing the fire to extinguish or the water to evaporate. Periodically replenish the water and stir to prevent sticking to the cauldron’s bottom. Once the time is complete, dry the mixture, then heat until glowing red. Allow to cool, rinse with hot water to remove the salt flavor, and dry in the sun. Form pills with jujube pulp, each the size of a small bean. Take five pills daily on an empty stomach, with tea or wine. Avoid mutton blood and mallow vegetables. This elixir treats women’s blood-qi disorders, warms the womb, preserves complexion, and enhances radiance. For chronic intestinal wind with incessant bloody stool, red-and-white vaginal discharge, or conditions unresponsive to other treatments, this elixir will eradicate the root cause. It cures all cold-related ailments without exception.\n\n**Grand Yang Purple-Powder Elixir**\nSulfur: three taels\nMirabilite: three taels\nMercury: three taels\n\nMix the three ingredients with five ge of ash-free wine in a mortar, grinding until they form a paste and the mercury stars vanish. Dry in the sun, then spread in a cauldron, sealing it tightly as per method. Place three to five taels of charcoal beneath the cauldron, maintaining a gentle fire for half a day. Gradually increase the fire to seven or eight taels, continuing for a full day and night before extinguishing. Once cool, retrieve the elixir, mix with white honey until thoroughly blended, and store in a green bamboo tube. Steam over rice for one cooking cycle, then remove and grind finely. Form pills with jujube pulp, each the size of a firmiana seed. Take three pills daily on an empty stomach, with salt broth, ginger broth, or wine. This elixir treats regurgitation, hard masses, and all cold diseases without fail. Pregnant women must not take it, as it may harm the fetus. Avoid carp.\n\n**Victorious Gold Elixir**\nCinnabar: three taels (ground separately, added last)\nOrpiment: one and a half taels\nSulfur: half a tael\n\nGrind all ingredients into fine powder. First, melt the two yellow ingredients (orpiment and sulfur) into a liquid using mulberry ash juice in a cauldron. Add the cinnabar powder, stirring until evenly blended and emulsified. Pour into approximately one and a half dou of ash juice, simmering for three days and nights while replenishing the warm ash juice. Once the elixir forms a precipitate, cease heating. Scrape the elixir into a crucible, dry over a gentle fire until all yin-qi dissipates, then seal tightly as per method. Heat with twenty catties of firewood, reducing the fire gradually to three to five catties before stopping. Once cool, retrieve the elixir, which will have settled into a single sheet at the crucible’s bottom. Chisel it out to form \"white gold,\" grind into fine powder, and boil in a porcelain vessel with licorice broth and emblic myrobalan for a day to remove fire toxin. Grind again until extremely fine, then form pills with millet rice, each the size of a mung bean. Take three pills daily on an empty stomach with cold pepper broth, increasing to five pills as needed. This elixir treats all wind disorders, hemiplegia, lockjaw, and paralysis; half a tael will effect a cure. Avoid mutton blood.\n\n**Brocade Gold Elixir**\nCapital yellow lead: two taels\nCinnabar: six taels\nMercury: six taels (ground)\n\nGrind all ingredients together until the mercury stars vanish and the mixture is as fine as powder. Blend with thick licorice broth until thoroughly mixed, then dry in the sun. Place in a jar, seal tightly, and heat with gentle fire for one day. Gradually increase the fire to five catties, maintaining it for another day. Finally, heat with ten catties of fire until glowing red. Once cool, retrieve the elixir, grind finely, and mix with sugar (candied toad’s saliva, i.e., granulated sugar).\n\nPills should be the size of sesame seeds. Take one pill daily on an empty stomach with cold pepper broth; those over fifty may take two pills. Morning dose brings evening recovery. Long-term use preserves youthful complexion, extends lifespan, replenishes essence and marrow, balances yin and yang, relieves lumbar and leg pain, treats cold-wind qi disorders, and warms the womb in women with blood-cold infertility, enabling conception. It breaks stagnant blood and dispels malevolent spirits. Do not take if pregnant. Those under twenty who are unmarried should not take it, as it may cause facial eruptions and harm. Avoid iron powder and peony.\n\n**Galloping Lower Elixir**\nFire-subdued Beiting saltpetre and fire-subdued sulphur: one tael each, ground to powder\n\nTake twenty sparrows, their breast meat and livers, and boil them in three sheng of bitter wine until the liquid evaporates. Grind to a paste, remove sinews and membranes, then pound with the medicinal powder to form pills the size of soybeans. Take five pills daily on an empty stomach with wine. It replenishes essence and qi, warms the water viscera, and its effects are divine.\n\n**Galloping Four-Spirit Elixir**\n[Missing character] #1: two taels; suet: one fen; cinnabar: one fen (if cinnabar is unavailable, use magnetite as substitute)\n\nGrind each ingredient separately, then add mercury and grind finely until the mercury stars vanish. Seal tightly in a jar. First, bury a jar of water level with the ground, place the medicinal jar atop it, and cut off the overflow. Repeat this process four or five times. Retrieve the elixir, grind finely, and place in a salt chamber. Nurture with four taels of fire for four days, then test a small amount over fire—if subdued, cease. Next, heat with fire until glowing red, then allow to cool. Mix with licorice broth and blend into cooked rice, steam for the duration of one meal, then form into pills the size of mung beans. Take three pills daily on an empty stomach with saliva. It treats all cold disorders in men and women, dispels retained blood in women, warms the womb, preserves youthful complexion, enhances vitality, invigorates yin and yang, strengthens sinews and bones, fortifies qi and pulse—its efficacy is wondrous.\n\n**Yin-Subduing Lower Elixir**\nMercury: two taels; tai [mineral]: two taels.\n\n**Mercury** is called \"quicksilver,\" and **tai** is sulfur. Take one catty of rusted iron—scrapings from the bottom of a cauldron are best. First, break the iron into pieces, heat until red-hot, then quench in water. Next, grind and wash it in sand and salt until clean, removing the red water. Repeat this process three times, grinding and washing until thoroughly purified. Place it in a jar, add mercury and sulfur, and fill the jar halfway with water. Double-boil in a cauldron for seven days and nights, replenishing with warm water as it evaporates. After seven days, remove the jar, dry it over fire, then heat until glowing red. Remove from the fire, quench in water, rinse away the iron, and collect the elixir. Dry it in the sun, then bury it in the earth for three days to dispel fire toxicity. Grind it with *north-court fire-subdued* [mineral] into a fine powder, mix with millet porridge, and form into pills the size of mung beans. Take two pills daily on an empty stomach, with tea or wine. Its divine efficacy will be self-evident.\n\n---\n\n**Life-Prolonging Elixir of Preserved Yang**\nRefined *yang-activating stone*: four taels; fire-subdued sulfur: four taels; realgar: one tael (if raw, grind finely and levigate with water); rock salt: one tael.\nGrind the first three ingredients together, then add rock salt and grind further. Mix with boiled water to form a ball, ensuring the water is not excessive. Wrap the ball in three layers of paper and dry it in the sun. Next, take twelve catties of white salt, pound it into a paste, and knead until it resembles lacquer. Select a jar large enough to hold all the salt, fill it halfway, and press firmly. Create a small depression in the center to hold the medicinal ball. Place the ball inside, then fill the jar with the remaining salt, packing it tightly to the brim. Bury the jar in an ash pit and heat it until thoroughly dry. Once the yin qi is fully expelled, cover the jar’s mouth with a tile and seal it properly. Dry it as before, then place it in the furnace. Cover the jar with three inches of ash, and atop the ash, place one catty of charcoal. Nurture with fire for five days, then reduce the heat. Afterward, add one inch of ash over the jar and place one catty of charcoal on top, nurturing for another five days. Then, remove one inch of ash from atop the jar and increase the fire to two catties, nurturing for another five days. Once complete, cease the fire and allow it to cool for the duration of one meal. Remove the jar, let it cool, then break it open. Discard the cover, extract the elixir from the salt chamber—it should form a purple mass, unreduced in weight. Grind it finely, then repeatedly rinse with boiling water to remove the salt taste. Expose it to dew overnight, then mix with licorice broth and double-boil for a full day until dry. Grind it again finely, add a small amount of borneol and musk, and form into pills the size of sesame seeds using jujube pulp. Take three pills daily on an empty stomach with wine; for extreme cold, take five pills. It treats cold disorders in men and women, as well as women’s blood and qi stagnation—its efficacy is beyond description. For the first ten days of use, avoid sexual activity, mutton blood, carp, garlic, and fermented bean paste.\n\n---\n\n**Divine Elixir for Consolidating Yang**\nTwenty-four sparrow livers (when catching sparrows, observe the black markings beneath the throat—more indicates a male, fewer a female); dog testicles and penis, sliced thinly and dried on a tile until crisp, then ground into powder; forty male silkworm moths; wolfberry fruit, stir-fried in ghee; realgar: one *fen* (if realgar is unavailable, substitute with musk).\nGrind all ingredients into a fine powder and form into pills using sparrow eggs. If sparrow eggs are unavailable, substitute with chicken egg yolk. Form into pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take five pills daily on an empty stomach with wine. It treats male impotence, cold accumulation in the water viscera, lumbar and leg pain, and weakness in walking. Its divine efficacy will be evident after three doses—its benefits are beyond description.\n\n---\n\n**Lower Elixir for Tonifying the Kidneys**\n*Bu gu zhi*: two taels; paper mulberry fruit: two taels; *bai ji*: two taels; aconite: two taels (blast-fried); mantis egg-cases: twenty-one (toasted—collect from small wild mulberry thickets, where mantis egg-cases are found); poria: two taels; snake slough: two taels; schisandra fruit: two taels.\nGrind all ingredients into a powder and form into honey pills the size of mung beans. Take fifteen pills daily on an empty stomach with wine, increasing to twenty-five pills. It treats cold in the male water viscera, tonifies sinews and bones, strengthens yang, and replenishes essence.\n\n---\n\n**Imperial Immortal Elixir**\nDeer antler: three taels (split into two pieces, toasted in ghee until fragrant and yellow, then brushed with fresh ginger juice and toasted until crisp, then ground into powder); processed *tian xiong*: one tael; mountain aconite: one tael (blast-fried, black skin removed, then ground into powder); henbane seeds: one tael (washed, boiled until sprouted, then stir-fried until yellow-black and ground); sulfur: one tael (oil-boiled until purple); cnidium seeds: one tael; magnetite frost: one tael; leek seeds: one tael (stir-fried and ground); cinnamon bark: one tael; fire-subdued *north-court* [mineral]: one tael; dragon bone: one tael.\nGrind all ingredients together into a paste. Take three to five sheep kidneys, remove the fat and membranes, chop finely, and grind thoroughly with the medicinal paste in a stone mortar to form pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take ten pills daily on an empty stomach with wine. Its efficacy will be self-evident. If sheep kidneys are unavailable, pig kidneys may be substituted.\n\n---\n\n**Sheep Kidney Elixir**\nOne pair of white sheep kidneys (remove fat and membranes, slice thinly, and dry on a tile until crisp, then grind into powder); sparrow droppings: one tael (white sparrow droppings); stalactite powder: one tael (if unavailable, substitute with deer antler); fire-subdued sulfur: one tael (if unavailable, oil-boil until purple).\nGrind all ingredients into a fine powder, mix with millet porridge, and form into pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take twenty pills daily on an empty stomach with cold pepper broth. After a while, take rice to press [the medicine]. It warms and tonifies the water viscera and invigorates the yang path. A fifty-year-old who takes it will have the sinews and blood of a twenty-year-old. Younger individuals will experience its benefits firsthand.\n\n---\n\n**Heat-Repelling Elixir**\nOrpiment (finely ground and levigated with water); kaolin (finely ground and levigated with water); cinnabar (select lustrous specimens, wrap in yellow mud from a riverbank, fire, then levigate with water until it resembles light powder); magnetite (crushed raw and levigated with water to remove the red [impurities]).\n\nTake equal parts of the above ingredients, each levigated and ground, then combine and grind again according to method until smooth as milk. Mix with refined white pine resin and form into pills the size of small beans. Take four pills on an empty stomach with hot water. After two or three doses, one may wear fur garments in summer without suffering from oppressive heat. This formula was once prepared for Emperor Yizong, and its efficacy in ingestion was proven. Later, it was again compounded for the Gentleman for Ceremonial Service of the Ministry of Rites, yielding remarkable results—yet none could fathom its workings.\n\n**Alternative Formula #2**\nRealgar; red kaolin (adhering to the tongue, levigated with water); lustrous cinnabar; dried ginger.\nTake equal parts of the four ingredients, levigate and grind into a fine powder, then mix with refined honey and white pine resin to form pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take four pills daily on an empty stomach with wine, continuing for ten days. For an entire winter, one will not feel cold, nor need to wear padded clothing, and may even sit or walk in water with bare skin. These two transmissions were imparted by divine immortals—hold them in reverence and keep them secret.\n\n**Peach-Throwing Elixir**\n\n**Fire-Tempered Northern Elixir**\n\nTake thirty-four young sparrows (heads, feet, and entrails removed, livers retained) and seven cock livers. Steep these in four *sheng* of fine wine along with at least half a *jin* of white sheep’s blood—excluding the Northern ingredient—then simmer over gentle heat until reduced to a yellow paste and ground to powder. Add half a *liang* of ox bezoar, one roasted and powdered white stallion’s penis, half a *liang* of malachite, and one large *liang* each of ginseng, cassia bark, Chinese angelica, dried rehmannia, ligusticum, peony, saposhnikovia, astragalus, licorice, blanched apricot kernels, bush cherry kernels, sweet flag, cuscuta, plantago seeds, cassia seeds, cistanche, and round cardamom. Grind all to a fine powder, then blend with clarified butter and honey. Incorporate the three preceding ingredients, pound three thousand times, and form into pills the size of mung beans. For those under twenty, take five pills daily on an empty stomach with wine; for those over thirty, take ten. Within two days, subtle transformations begin—only increase the dose gradually, never abruptly. Take after meals to aid absorption.\n\nThis elixir strengthens men who are weak, frail, or undersized; after thirty days of use, they will grow in vigor. Those without wives should not take it, for it may induce dreams of women—hence its name, *Peach-Throwing Pills*.\n\n---\n\n**Deer Antler Powder**\n\nTake eight *fen* of male silkworm moths, ten *fen* of refined actinolite, eight *fen* each of purple aster, polygala, cassia bark, roasted dodder, cistanche, and snake plum kernels, and ten *fen* of stalactite (steeped in wine). Grind all into a powder and take five *qian* on an empty stomach with wine. Adjust the dose based on warmth or chill—reduce if overheated, increase if cold.\n\nThis remedy treats the five taxations and seven injuries in men, replenishes sinews and blood, augments essence and arouses yang, dispels night sweats, and halts nocturnal emissions caused by spectral intercourse. Effects appear after a single dose.\n\n---\n\n**Cold Draft Tonic**\n\nTake three *fen* of fennel (use roots in spring and summer, seeds in autumn and winter), three *fen* of polygala (hearts removed), two roasted aconite roots, three *fen* each of alisma, dioscorea, and cistanche, and twenty roasted mantis egg-cases. Grind all into a powder and divide into two portions. Dice one pair of sheep kidneys (fat and membranes removed), simmer in one and a half *sheng* of water until reduced to five *ge*, strain, and expose to dew overnight. Take one *ge* daily on an empty stomach, chilled. Prepare four doses per season to ward off pestilence, fortify the lower *qi*, and yield divine efficacy. Keep this secret.\n\n---\n\n**Alchemical Dew Powder (with separate oral instructions)**\n\n**Five-Needle Pine Pollen** (also called *pine yellow*). The finest comes from Mount Taiyi’s peak in Zhongnan; next is that from Nanyue’s Linghua Mountain, near the Bright Star Pool. In ancient times, the beauties of King Qin consumed it and transformed into feathered immortals. Wei Shuqing also took it.\n\nGather ten *shuo* of the pollen and place it in a large pine-wood vat. Steep in springtime grass dew—if dew from wheat stalks is obtained, the results are indescribably superior. White honey from stone cliffs is also excellent. After twenty days, when the pollen appears sodden, strain and place in a cypress basin, trampling it to a porridge-like consistency. Rinse with fresh dew, then filter through silk gauze into a porcelain vat. Repeat the trampling until the residue is exhausted. Proceed as in starch-making: settle the sediment, dry in the sun, then pound in a cypress mortar and pestle. Store in paper bags, one *sheng* per bag.\n\nThe powder contains jade shards—cooked with yogurt, it is delicious. It nourishes the body, promotes weight gain, extends years, smooths wrinkles, enhances fertility, and strengthens vitality. After one year of consuming jade shards, one’s pace rivals a galloping horse; after two years, one may attain the Dao of immortality.\n\n---\n\n**Refined Flower Powder (with separate oral instructions)**\n\nTake one *sheng* of the preceding powder and simmer with three *sheng* of white cow’s milk in a large silver pan until it reaches a thin syrup consistency. Transfer to a large copper vessel, suspend a grass-woven basket in a cauldron, and double-boil. Stir continuously with a *wutong* wood spatula until it thickens to a paste. Dry in the sun, then pound and sift into powder. Refine the remaining powder in the same manner.\n\nThis powder also contains jade shards—cooked with sesame broth, it is sweet and delicious, promotes hair growth, and brightens the eyes. It enables two-hundred-year-old women and three-hundred-year-old men to bear children. After one hundred days of consumption, its wonders are beyond description. Store the refined powder in paper bags, one *sheng* per bag.\n\n---\n\n**Fermented Immortal Nectar (with separate oral instructions)**\n\nTake a large porcelain vat with a capacity of two *shuo* and eight *sheng*. Place one *shuo* and five *sheng* of medicinal sprout water in a basin and steam one *shuo* and five *sheng* of glutinous rice into congee. Mix with five large *dou* each of the preceding powder, water, dried peach blossoms, and dried apricot blossoms, then steam and stir with powdered water. Use only *jinlan* wood (five-fruit wood), *yangshi* wood (pine), or *song* wood as fuel—others are unsuitable.\n\nOnce the congee cools to a suitable temperature, transfer it to a large basin. Add five *dou* of the refined flower-and-milk powder and twenty *jin* of roasted barley flour, ground to a powder and fried until yellow. Cool, then blend thoroughly in the basin. Add three *dou* of lotus seeds, eight *jin* of powdered poria, and two *dou* of roasted and powdered *juqu* (ferment starter), mixing well. Finally, incorporate two *dou* of fresh rehmannia juice and stir.\n\nTransfer the mixture to the vat, seal the opening with honey, and open after twenty-one days. At the center will be a cup of emerald-green nectar, half-crimson like lapis lazuli—this is the essence of the elixir. Drink it to attain longevity. Press the remainder to extract the liquid and store in three separate porcelain vats. Divide two *shuo* of *jinyan* flowers and *yudou* flowers among the three vats.\n\nFurther steam two *shuo* of glutinous rice and divide among the three vats, ensuring the temperature is just right. Then take three *dou* of *gou* (ferment starter), grind to a powder, and blend in, sealing for a full seven days until ripe. Strain and decant into separate vessels—its fragrance and savor are exquisite.\n\n**The Efficacy of the Elixir Nectar**\n**Method for Consuming the Elixir Nectar:**\nAt cock’s crow, face the east. Spread five-colored silks to form the seat of the Great Mystery Lord Lao. The one taking the elixir shall don Daoist robes, hold a tablet, and stand in the west, facing east toward the rising sun, envisioning the Jade Maiden of the Emperor as if present before them. Burn incense and invoke:\n\n*\"Great Dao, Heavenly Worthy, deign to bestow sacred protection. May the Mountain Spirit King and the Sweet Dew Sea Spirit hold cups of crimson jasper blossoms to fill this disciple’s elixir draught, that upon drinking, I may prolong life and regain youth, thereby greatly aiding all living beings and fulfilling loyalty and filial piety to sovereign and father.\"*\n\nOnce the invocation is complete, take seven bundles of white cogon grass, divide into seven mounds, and on each spread seven *chi* of crimson silk. Place seven silver cups, each filled with nine *ge* of the elixir nectar, upon the mounds. Chant:\n\n*\"Supreme Clarity’s wondrous nectar, essence bestowed by the Great Mystery. I now diligently consume it, that I may attain long life.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, gather the nectar from the cups into one large vessel of the Five Worthies, divide into three doses, and consume—this will invigorate the body greatly.\n\nAfter the first ten days of consumption, the body will perspire profusely. After ten more days, the sweat will cease, and the body will grow increasingly fragrant and smooth as lapis lazuli. By sixty days, the bones will gleam with fresh luster. At seventy days, the cinnabar field will shine brightly. At ninety days, the complexion will bloom like peach and plum. By a hundred days, hoary hair will turn black. After half a year, an octogenarian will resemble a man of thirty in vigor, with the strength of a hundred men. After one year, spirit and understanding will merge. After two years, one may become an earthbound immortal. After three years, ascension upon clouds may be achieved.\n\nThere is no fixed time for consuming this elixir—take it as soon as possible, adjusting the dosage according to one’s constitution. If one consumes up to ten *shi*, the bones and marrow will be wholly transformed into those of an immortal.\n\nThis formula is supremely wondrous; its treasures must not be recklessly transmitted. Should it be lightly divulged, calamity will befall seven generations of ancestors. It is not to be imparted to the unworthy but only to the great immortal Yin Xi. Once received with reverence, one may journey to grotto-heavens where all immortals who partake of this elixir soar aloft. Should one wish to summon the myriad immortals as teachers and have all spirits as attendants, take powdered white dragon bone mixed with red gold powder. There are no prohibitions.\n\nHowever, one must maintain purity when compounding it, avoiding foul odors and strictly adhering to the methods of immortals. The detailed instructions for preparing the elixir are recorded in a separate scroll.\n\n**Secret of Gathering Medicinal Sprouts**\nFrom the first day of the first month onward, gather the sprouts of a hundred herbs from sunny slopes—these are the fresh sprouts of medicinal herbs, including all varieties of grasses. If the sprouts are too small, use the roots instead.\n\n- Coltsfoot sprouts: five *dou*\n- *Kualou* sprouts: five *dou*\n- Morinda root sprouts: five *dou* (if unavailable, substitute bamboo sprouts)\n- Dwarf lilyturf sprouts: five *dou*\n- Bupleurum sprouts: five *dou*\n- Asparagus sprouts: five *dou*\n- Purple chrysanthemum sprouts: five *dou*\n- Raspberry sprouts: five *dou*\n- Garden burnet sprouts: six *dou*\n- *Xuanfu* sprouts: six *dou*\n- *Lianqian* sprouts: five *dou* (if unavailable, substitute *xixin* (Chinese wild ginger), also called *jixuecao*, as the finest alternative)\n- Saposhnikovia sprouts: five *dou* (if unavailable, substitute purple orchid sprouts; if saposhnikovia root is obtained, its juice is best)\n- *Cihu* sprouts: five *dou*\n- *Shuzhan* sprouts: five *dou*\n- Plantain sprouts: five *dou*\n- Cimicifuga sprouts: five *dou* (if unavailable, substitute ephedra)\n- Honeysuckle sprouts: five *dou* (if unavailable, steam the stems and leaves, press to extract juice; if all else fails, substitute *shuisu*)\n- Solomon’s seal sprouts: five *dou*\n- Cogon grass sprouts: one *shuo*\n- Rehmannia sprouts: one *shuo*\n- Red arrowroot sprouts: three *dou*\n- Scutellaria sprouts: five *dou* (if unavailable, take one hundred *jin* of tender roots and press to extract juice; if all else fails, substitute white mugwort, which can blacken hair)\n- Smilax sprouts: five *dou*\n- Peony sprouts: six *dou*\n- Angelica sprouts: five *dou*\n- Yam sprouts: six *dou* (also take additional roots to make powder, mix with *gou*, and ferment together)\n- Dwarf lilyturf juice: two *shuo* and five *dou*\n- Achyranthes juice: one *shuo* and five *dou*\n- Rehmannia juice: one *shuo* and five *dou*\n\n**Oral Instructions:**\nMedicinal herb sprouts are mostly warm, for yang qi flourishes in spring. One must carefully select the finest. For the hundred-herb sprouts from sunny slopes, dig up the roots and test the sprouts on dry clods of earth: if the juice soaks in without causing the soil to crumble, they are good and should be collected; if the soil splits, they are unfit and should be discarded.\n\nIf one has previously consumed cinnabar, milk, metals, or minerals, gather more of the aforementioned medicinal sprouts and fewer of the hundred-herb sprouts.\n\n**The Scroll of Arcane and Mysterious Techniques concludes.**\n\n**[Another Recipe:]** *(These two characters were originally missing and have been supplied based on context.)*",

      "translated_text": "**The Esoteric Arts of Penetrating the Mysteries**\n\n**Title:** *Esoteric Arts of Penetrating the Mysteries*\nCompiled by Shen Zhiyan of the Tang dynasty. One fascicle.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* section, *Zhongshu* category.\n\n**Preface to *Esoteric Arts of Penetrating the Mysteries***\nThe foundation of a person’s existence lies in cultivating the Dao and refining techniques, with strengthening the body as the foremost priority. In the vigor of youth, who considers the decline of later years? Humanity, endowed with the nobility of the Three Powers, possesses a round head and square feet, perfectly mirroring the forms of Heaven and Earth—one must not neglect or squander this gift.\n\nIn my early years, I, Zhiyan, devoted my heart to the Dao. In the first year of the Taihe era, while serving in the Bureau of Documents, I encountered the Daoist Master Ma Ziran, who imparted to me secret formulas and the *Mysterious Elixir of Free Will*, along with the *Five Methods of Liberation*. Though I was but a humble and unlearned man, unable to fathom the profound mysteries, I often inquired among the world of men. Through the practices of *caibu* and life extension, I occasionally grasped fragments of their essence.\n\nIn the spring of the fifth year of the Xiantong era, while in Huainan, my old friend, Lord Zheng of Rongyang, revealed to me the secret essentials of various divine elixirs. These were all methods for aiding the world, treating all manner of illnesses among people, and prolonging life—techniques for subduing the Five Metals and Eight Stones, transmuting and transforming, warding off cold and heat, and abstaining from grains. Even for arrowheads lodged deep in the flesh for years, when anointed with this elixir, they would emerge of their own accord, demonstrating the divine efficacy of transformation, as recorded within these three fascicles. Later scholars of the Dao who peruse these texts will surely find their minds enlightened and their eyes astonished.\n\nThe methods for refining *huohuo* minerals and divine elixirs are all contained herein. I, Zhiyan, have arranged and compiled them into three fascicles—upper, middle, and lower—entitled *Esoteric Arts of Penetrating the Mysteries*, to present to those of like aspiration. The root of nurturing life is to be shared with fellow seekers; I only ask that it not be lightly transmitted.\n\n**Compiled by Shen Zhiyan, a commoner of Jineshan**\n**Zheng’s Three-Life Elixir**\n\n**Fire-Refined Cinnabar**\n**Fire-Refined Northern Borax**\n**Fire-Refined Borneol**\nThe above three ingredients, each one and a half *liang*, are ground together into a fine powder, mixed with fermented water until moist, dried in the sun, and then ground again.\n\n**Magnetite**, one *liang* (select those that strongly attract needles, quench in vinegar, and grind into powder)\n**Stalactite**, one *liang* (finely ground)\n**Red Halloysite**, three *liang* (select those that adhere to the tongue, finely ground)\n\nPlace all ingredients into a jar, dry according to method, and set the jar in an ash furnace, burying it in ash up to three *cun*. Apply two *jin* of fire to thoroughly heat it, then increase the fire to ten *jin*, gradually intensifying until the jar glows red for the duration of a meal. When the elixir is ready, immerse the jar in water, break the lid with an iron spoon, and rinse until cool before opening. The surface of the elixir will be white, while the interior shines with a purple-golden luster. Grind it with a spoon into a fine powder, place it on clean paper in a pure space, and cover it with a basin for a day to dispel the fire toxin. Then form it into pills the size of small beans with millet gruel. Take three pills on an empty stomach with water to neutralize all poisons. If someone has been poisoned, administer it in wine or food.\n\nIt treats heart and abdominal pain, *chuanshi* disease, foul armpits, malign *qi*, perverse *qi*, and demonic *qi* attacking the heart. Mix three *qian* of the elixir powder with vinegar and consume—divinely effective.\n\n*Chuanshi* is a malignant disease where, regardless of family size, one person dies and transmits it to another, potentially annihilating the entire clan. Those fortunate enough to encounter this elixir and consume it will find that once one person is cured, the disease will not spread further. The illness manifests as acute consumption with yellowing and emaciation.\n\nFor suppurating carbuncles on the back with unceasing pus and blood, regardless of whether the sore is above or below the heart, mix the elixir powder with vinegar and spread it evenly on thin paper, applying it to the sore according to its size. Change the dressing every other day while also taking the elixir pills. After three to five applications, the sore will gradually contract and heal. Avoid all toxic foods. Once the pus and blood cease, recovery will follow within ten to fifteen days.\n\nFor piercing pain in the head or face, or dizziness and wind in the head, take three *qian* of the powder mixed with vinegar to permanently eradicate the root cause. If one has previously consumed sulfur or *shifanshi* and suffers from toxin outbreaks, taking two pills will yield immediate results. This elixir is the sovereign of all medicines, and the condition will not recur thereafter.\n\nWhen refining mineral elixirs, many fail to dispel the fire toxin before forming pills or powders. After consumption, if one neglects proper rest and recuperation, the fire toxin will manifest. However, if the fire toxin is first expelled before preparation, it will never arise.\n\nFor *sanyin* disease, take the elixir with *huanglian* decoction, or form pills with *huanglian* powder for consumption. For yin jaundice and back swelling, take three *qian* with tea to halt the condition. Back swelling is a precursor to carbuncles.\n\nFor mouth sores, mix the elixir with honey and apply to the tongue. For red and white vaginal discharge, take it mixed with wine. For arrowheads lodged in the flesh from battle, grind *bi li* vine roots into juice, mix with the elixir, and apply to the wound—the arrowhead will emerge on its own.\n\nFor women suffering from wind pain after childbirth or unbearable *qi* and blood surging into the heart, take three *qian* mixed with vinegar and wine to provide relief. For itching from lacquer sores, wash with lotus leaf decoction, then apply the elixir powder to heal.\n\nFor all poisonous insect bites, epilepsy, and heart disturbances caused by evil influences, grind rhinoceros horn into water and take three *qian* of the elixir. For uncontrolled vomiting of blood, take as directed for divine efficacy.\n\n**Azure-Blossom Elixir**\n**Azurite**, one *liang* (ground)\n**Lead White**, one *liang*\n**White Halloysite**, half a *liang*\n**Bright Cinnabar**, half a *liang*\n**Salt Blossom**\n**Peach-Blossom Stone**, each half a *liang* (if unavailable, substitute with magnetite)\n\nGrind all ingredients into a fine powder and place them in a jar. Cover the top with salt blossom and seal it securely, allowing it to dry. Apply one to two *liang* of fire around the jar, gradually moving closer until the heat penetrates all sides. Then place a *cheng* of charcoal fire around it, allowing the fire to consume itself for the duration of a meal. If the jar begins to boil, wait a short while before stopping.",

      "translated_text": "Once cooled completely, open the jar and remove the medicine, then pound it to break it apart. Perform water levigation to remove the saltiness, dry it thoroughly, and add a small amount of musk. Grind them together, then form into pills with cooked rice, each the size of a sesame seed. Take five pills daily on an empty stomach with wine, avoiding sheep’s blood and cold water. This elixir treats cholera, abdominal distension with cold qi, infantile malnutrition, malnutrition-induced intestinal wind, and all cold disorders in women’s blood and qi. With prolonged use, its effects are wondrous.\n\n**Sun-Flowing Pearl Elixir**\n**Sun Mineral**, one *jin*\n**Niter**, four *liang*\n**Salt Blossom**, four *liang* (stir-fried until smoke dissipates)\n**Northern Borax**, three *liang*\n\nGrind the four ingredients into a fine powder and pack tightly into a jar. Cover the top with a thin layer of stir-fried salt to expel yin qi, then seal as directed. Place the jar inside a crucible. First, melt half a *jin* of lead and pour it into the jar, securing it with an iron rod. Then melt additional lead and pour it into the crucible until the jar is submerged. Seal thoroughly, place in an ash furnace, and maintain a fire to keep the lead half-molten, using the lead as an indicator. After one hundred days, remove the jar from the crucible. For three more days, maintain a fire of five to six *liang*, increasing the heat daily until the contents turn red, then stop. Once cooled, remove the substance—now amber in color—soak it in cold spring water to remove fire toxin, grind finely, and form into pills with jujube pulp, each the size of a mung bean. Take two pills daily on an empty stomach with tea. This elixir dispels all chronic cold wind, abdominal masses, congealed blood in women, red and white vaginal discharge, intestinal wind with bloody stool, long-standing qi-induced dysentery, cold rashes, clear-water vomiting, acid reflux, and all other ailments—all are cured by it.\n\n**Yellow Court Elixir**\n**Sulfur**, one *liang*\n**Northern Borax**, one *liang* (ground together into a fine powder)\n\nPlace the mixture into a small container, seal as directed, and place in an ash furnace. Maintain a constant fire of four *liang* for seven days, then move the container to the furnace’s base for one additional day. Remove and observe: the Sun Mineral should be on top, the Northern Borax below. Grind them together again, return to the container, and repeat the process for another seven days, followed by one day at the base. Then stop. Upon removal, if the Sun Mineral is no longer on top, it has been subdued by fire. Mix with wax, boil to remove fire toxin (the wax will turn black as lacquer), then remove the wax and dry. Grind finely and form into pills with cooked rice, each the size of a millet grain. Take two pills daily on an empty stomach with wine or vinegar decoction. This elixir breaks up chronic blood and qi stagnation in women, lightens the body, and strengthens vitality. After taking it, no illnesses will arise. The pill resides in the *dantian* within the body; after ten or five years, if injury from a fall or blow causes lingering pain, recite: *\"I once consumed a divine elixir, and now this pain arises within me—let it be healed.\"* Have another person massage the affected area until a fiery sensation moves within the flesh to the painful spot, whereupon the pain will cease. Such is the miraculous efficacy of this elixir—its merits cannot be fully described.\n\n**Canopy Elixir**\n**Black Lead**, three *jin* (use only the finest, hammered into square chimes, pierced with iron rods, and strung with cord)\n\nTake a clean jar and fill it with one *dou* of rice vinegar. Suspend the lead pieces inside, ensuring they remain one *cun* above the vinegar, then seal the jar tightly with paper. Every seven days, open the jar to replace the lead pieces, scraping off the frost onto clean paper with a small bamboo spatula or bird feather, then return the lead to the jar. After three or four cycles, replace the lead pieces, as their potency weakens. For every *liang* of lead frost, add half a *fen* of borneol, grind into a fine powder, and form into pills with dew water, each the size of a firmiana seed. Before sleep each night, hold one pill in the mouth and lie down without speaking, allowing it to dissolve naturally. This elixir transforms hair: if not yet white, taking it every other day ensures it will never whiten; if already white, after twenty days of use, pluck the white hairs, and black ones will grow in their place. Within sixty to one hundred pills, temples and hair will turn deep black, lustrous as lacquer. In some cases, two black hairs may sprout from a single follicle where a white one was plucked. This elixir is rare in the world, transmitted from the golden mouth of an immortal. With prolonged use, it preserves youthful complexion—at fifty, one’s appearance may resemble a child’s. It also dispels heat toxin, wind, and pain in sinews and bones.",

      "translated_text": "One must abstain from garlic for life.\n\n**Purple-Gold Elixir**\nRefined Northern Court saltpeter: five taels (ground separately, added last to the medicinal mixture)\nFresh rehmannia: ten catties (crushed, pressed to extract juice)\nApricot kernels: five sheng (tips and skins removed, ground)\nGold Prefecture pepper: half a catty\nSichuan aconite: half a catty (roasted, skin removed, weighed)\n\nGrind all the above ingredients—except the rehmannia juice—into fine powder. Place the rehmannia juice in a cauldron (a silver pot is best). Use approximately one catty of charcoal, banking the fire with ash on all sides, and simmer slowly; avoid intense heat. Add the medicinal powder, stirring three hundred times with a willow-wood spatula, then incorporate the Northern Court saltpeter, stirring continuously without pause. When the mixture thickens sufficiently, form pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take one to ten pills daily on an empty stomach, washed down with wine. After ingestion, wait a while before eating rice to aid absorption. Women may also take this elixir. Avoid mutton blood. Pregnant women must not consume it. This elixir specifically treats the five taxations and seven injuries in men, as well as all cold diseases and wind-qi disorders. With prolonged use, it whitens the beard, preserves youthful complexion, extends lifespan, and strengthens bones—truly a divine and efficacious elixir.\n\n**Yellow-Flourish Elixir**\nJade fragments: one tael\nArsenolite: one tael (boiled in one sheng of vinegar until dry)\nLitharge: one tael\nFrankincense: one tael\nHuman fecal frost: one tael (dried; place in a ceramic vessel, heat with charcoal until glowing red, then cover with another vessel until cool; do not allow it to turn to ash before removing)\n\nGrind all ingredients into fine powder. Heat half a sheng of aged, high-quality rice vinegar, melt the frankincense in it, then add the mixture. Mix with powdered Cold-Food Festival steamed cake, grinding repeatedly until it forms a paste. Blend with refined honey to form pills the size of black soybeans. This elixir specifically treats cold-qi heart pain and women’s blood-qi heart disorders. Take one pill on an empty stomach with vinegar broth; symptoms will subside momentarily. For chronic conditions, take one pill daily on an empty stomach for up to twenty doses—all ailments will be cured. For women with deep-seated heart disorders, thirty pills will ensure lifelong freedom from recurrence. Pregnant women must not take this elixir, as it may harm the fetus. Avoid mutton blood and poisonous fish.\n\n**Yin-Concealing Purple-Gold Elixir**\nSulfur: five taels (crushed, ground, and water-floated)\nSalt flowers: one sheng\n\nSpread half a sheng of salt flowers in a small, flat-bottomed cauldron, layer the sulfur powder atop it, then cover with the remaining salt. Seal the cauldron with a ceramic lid, ensuring water submerges the mixture by about two inches. Seal the edges with damp paper. Maintain a gentle fire, keeping the water at a fish-eye boil for seven days and nights without allowing the fire to extinguish or the water to evaporate. Periodically replenish the water and stir to prevent sticking to the cauldron’s bottom. Once the time is complete, dry the mixture, then heat until glowing red. Allow to cool, rinse with hot water to remove the salt flavor, and dry in the sun. Form pills with jujube pulp, each the size of a small bean. Take five pills daily on an empty stomach, with tea or wine. Avoid mutton blood and mallow vegetables. This elixir treats women’s blood-qi disorders, warms the womb, preserves complexion, and enhances radiance. For chronic intestinal wind with incessant bloody stool, red-and-white vaginal discharge, or conditions unresponsive to other treatments, this elixir will eradicate the root cause. It cures all cold-related ailments without exception.\n\n**Grand Yang Purple-Powder Elixir**\nSulfur: three taels\nMirabilite: three taels\nMercury: three taels\n\nMix the three ingredients with five ge of ash-free wine in a mortar, grinding until they form a paste and the mercury stars vanish. Dry in the sun, then spread in a cauldron, sealing it tightly as per method. Place three to five taels of charcoal beneath the cauldron, maintaining a gentle fire for half a day. Gradually increase the fire to seven or eight taels, continuing for a full day and night before extinguishing. Once cool, retrieve the elixir, mix with white honey until thoroughly blended, and store in a green bamboo tube. Steam over rice for one cooking cycle, then remove and grind finely. Form pills with jujube pulp, each the size of a firmiana seed. Take three pills daily on an empty stomach, with salt broth, ginger broth, or wine. This elixir treats regurgitation, hard masses, and all cold diseases without fail. Pregnant women must not take it, as it may harm the fetus. Avoid carp.\n\n**Victorious Gold Elixir**\nCinnabar: three taels (ground separately, added last)\nOrpiment: one and a half taels\nSulfur: half a tael\n\nGrind all ingredients into fine powder. First, melt the two yellow ingredients (orpiment and sulfur) into a liquid using mulberry ash juice in a cauldron. Add the cinnabar powder, stirring until evenly blended and emulsified. Pour into approximately one and a half dou of ash juice, simmering for three days and nights while replenishing the warm ash juice. Once the elixir forms a precipitate, cease heating. Scrape the elixir into a crucible, dry over a gentle fire until all yin-qi dissipates, then seal tightly as per method. Heat with twenty catties of firewood, reducing the fire gradually to three to five catties before stopping. Once cool, retrieve the elixir, which will have settled into a single sheet at the crucible’s bottom. Chisel it out to form \"white gold,\" grind into fine powder, and boil in a porcelain vessel with licorice broth and emblic myrobalan for a day to remove fire toxin. Grind again until extremely fine, then form pills with millet rice, each the size of a mung bean. Take three pills daily on an empty stomach with cold pepper broth, increasing to five pills as needed. This elixir treats all wind disorders, hemiplegia, lockjaw, and paralysis; half a tael will effect a cure. Avoid mutton blood.\n\n**Brocade Gold Elixir**\nCapital yellow lead: two taels\nCinnabar: six taels\nMercury: six taels (ground)\n\nGrind all ingredients together until the mercury stars vanish and the mixture is as fine as powder. Blend with thick licorice broth until thoroughly mixed, then dry in the sun. Place in a jar, seal tightly, and heat with gentle fire for one day.

With prolonged use, it preserves youthful complexion—at fifty, one’s appearance may resemble a child’s. It also dispels heat toxin, wind, and pain in sinews and bones.",

Repeat this process three times, grinding and washing until thoroughly purified. Place it in a jar, add mercury and sulfur, and fill the jar halfway with water. Double-boil in a cauldron for seven days and nights, replenishing with warm water as it evaporates. After seven days, remove the jar, dry it over fire, then heat until glowing red. Remove from the fire, quench in water, rinse away the iron, and collect the elixir. Dry it in the sun, then bury it in the earth for three days to dispel fire toxicity. Grind it with *north-court fire-subdued* [mineral] into a fine powder, mix with millet porridge, and form into pills the size of mung beans. Take two pills daily on an empty stomach, with tea or wine.

Mix with boiled water to form a ball, ensuring the water is not excessive. Wrap the ball in three layers of paper and dry it in the sun. Next, take twelve catties of white salt, pound it into a paste, and knead until it resembles lacquer. Select a jar large enough to hold all the salt, fill it halfway, and press firmly. Create a small depression in the center to hold the medicinal ball. Place the ball inside, then fill the jar with the remaining salt, packing it tightly to the brim. Bury the jar in an ash pit and heat it until thoroughly dry. Once the yin qi is fully expelled, cover the jar’s mouth with a tile and seal it properly. Dry it as before, then place it in the furnace. Cover the jar with three inches of ash, and atop the ash, place one catty of charcoal. Nurture with fire for five days, then reduce the heat. Afterward, add one inch of ash over the jar and place one catty of charcoal on top, nurturing for another five days. Then, remove one inch of ash from atop the jar and increase the fire to two catties, nurturing for another five days. Once complete, cease the fire and allow it to cool for the duration of one meal. Remove the jar, let it cool, then break it open. Discard the cover, extract the elixir from the salt chamber—it should form a purple mass, unreduced in weight. Grind it finely, then repeatedly rinse with boiling water to remove the salt taste. Expose it to dew overnight, then mix with licorice broth and double-boil for a full day until dry. Grind it again finely, add a small amount of borneol and musk, and form into pills the size of sesame seeds using jujube pulp. Take three pills daily on an empty stomach with wine; for extreme cold, take five pills.

If sparrow eggs are unavailable, substitute with chicken egg yolk. Form into pills the size of firmiana seeds. Take five pills daily on an empty stomach with wine.

      "translated_text": "**Fire-Tempered Northern Elixir**\n\nTake thirty-four young sparrows (heads, feet, and entrails removed, livers retained) and seven cock livers. Steep these in four *sheng* of fine wine along with at least half a *jin* of white sheep’s blood—excluding the Northern ingredient—then simmer over gentle heat until reduced to a yellow paste and ground to powder. Add half a *liang* of ox bezoar, one roasted and powdered white stallion’s penis, half a *liang* of malachite, and one large *liang* each of ginseng, cassia bark, Chinese angelica, dried rehmannia, ligusticum, peony, saposhnikovia, astragalus, licorice, blanched apricot kernels, bush cherry kernels, sweet flag, cuscuta, plantago seeds, cassia seeds, cistanche, and round cardamom. Grind all to a fine powder, then blend with clarified butter and honey. Incorporate the three preceding ingredients, pound three thousand times, and form into pills the size of mung beans. For those under twenty, take five pills daily on an empty stomach with wine; for those over thirty, take ten. Within two days, subtle transformations begin—only increase the dose gradually, never abruptly. Take after meals to aid absorption.\n\nThis elixir strengthens men who are weak, frail, or undersized; after thirty days of use, they will grow in vigor. Those without wives should not take it, for it may induce dreams of women—hence its name, *Peach-Throwing Pills*.\n\n---\n\n**Deer Antler Powder**\n\nTake eight *fen* of male silkworm moths, ten *fen* of refined actinolite, eight *fen* each of purple aster, polygala, cassia bark, roasted dodder, cistanche, and snake plum kernels, and ten *fen* of stalactite (steeped in wine). Grind all into a powder and take five *qian* on an empty stomach with wine. Adjust the dose based on warmth or chill—reduce if overheated, increase if cold.\n\nThis remedy treats the five taxations and seven injuries in men, replenishes sinews and blood, augments essence and arouses yang, dispels night sweats, and halts nocturnal emissions caused by spectral intercourse. Effects appear after a single dose.\n\n---\n\n**Cold Draft Tonic**\n\nTake three *fen* of fennel (use roots in spring and summer, seeds in autumn and winter), three *fen* of polygala (hearts removed), two roasted aconite roots, three *fen* each of alisma, dioscorea, and cistanche, and twenty roasted mantis egg-cases. Grind all into a powder and divide into two portions. Dice one pair of sheep kidneys (fat and membranes removed), simmer in one and a half *sheng* of water until reduced to five *ge*, strain, and expose to dew overnight. Take one *ge* daily on an empty stomach, chilled. Prepare four doses per season to ward off pestilence, fortify the lower *qi*, and yield divine efficacy. Keep this secret.\n\n---\n\n**Alchemical Dew Powder (with separate oral instructions)**\n\n**Five-Needle Pine Pollen** (also called *pine yellow*). The finest comes from Mount Taiyi’s peak in Zhongnan; next is that from Nanyue’s Linghua Mountain, near the Bright Star Pool. In ancient times, the beauties of King Qin consumed it and transformed into feathered immortals. Wei Shuqing also took it.\n\nGather ten *shuo* of the pollen and place it in a large pine-wood vat. Steep in springtime grass dew—if dew from wheat stalks is obtained, the results are indescribably superior. White honey from stone cliffs is also excellent. After twenty days, when the pollen appears sodden, strain and place in a cypress basin, trampling it to a porridge-like consistency. Rinse with fresh dew, then filter through silk gauze into a porcelain vat. Repeat the trampling until the residue is exhausted. Proceed as in starch-making: settle the sediment, dry in the sun, then pound in a cypress mortar and pestle. Store in paper bags, one *sheng* per bag.\n\nThe powder contains jade shards—cooked with yogurt, it is delicious. It nourishes the body, promotes weight gain, extends years, smooths wrinkles, enhances fertility, and strengthens vitality. After one year of consuming jade shards, one’s pace rivals a galloping horse; after two years, one may attain the Dao of immortality.\n\n---\n\n**Refined Flower Powder (with separate oral instructions)**\n\nTake one *sheng* of the preceding powder and simmer with three *sheng* of white cow’s milk in a large silver pan until it reaches a thin syrup consistency. Transfer to a large copper vessel, suspend a grass-woven basket in a cauldron, and double-boil. Stir continuously with a *wutong* wood spatula until it thickens to a paste. Dry in the sun, then pound and sift into powder. Refine the remaining powder in the same manner.\n\nThis powder also contains jade shards—cooked with sesame broth, it is sweet and delicious, promotes hair growth, and brightens the eyes. It enables two-hundred-year-old women and three-hundred-year-old men to bear children. After one hundred days of consumption, its wonders are beyond description. Store the refined powder in paper bags, one *sheng* per bag.\n\n---\n\n**Fermented Immortal Nectar (with separate oral instructions)**\n\nTake a large porcelain vat with a capacity of two *shuo* and eight *sheng*. Place one *shuo* and five *sheng* of medicinal sprout water in a basin and steam one *shuo* and five *sheng* of glutinous rice into congee. Mix with five large *dou* each of the preceding powder, water, dried peach blossoms, and dried apricot blossoms, then steam and stir with powdered water. Use only *jinlan* wood (five-fruit wood), *yangshi* wood (pine), or *song* wood as fuel—others are unsuitable.\n\nOnce the congee cools to a suitable temperature, transfer it to a large basin. Add five *dou* of the refined flower-and-milk powder and twenty *jin* of roasted barley flour, ground to a powder and fried until yellow. Cool, then blend thoroughly in the basin. Add three *dou* of lotus seeds, eight *jin* of powdered poria, and two *dou* of roasted and powdered *juqu* (ferment starter), mixing well. Finally, incorporate two *dou* of fresh rehmannia juice and stir.\n\nTransfer the mixture to the vat, seal the opening with honey, and open after twenty-one days. At the center will be a cup of emerald-green nectar, half-crimson like lapis lazuli—this is the essence of the elixir. Drink it to attain longevity.

Strain and decant into separate vessels—its fragrance and savor are exquisite.\n\n**The Efficacy of the Elixir Nectar**\n**Method for Consuming the Elixir Nectar:**\nAt cock’s crow, face the east. Spread five-colored silks to form the seat of the Great Mystery Lord Lao. The one taking the elixir shall don Daoist robes, hold a tablet, and stand in the west, facing east toward the rising sun, envisioning the Jade Maiden of the Emperor as if present before them. Burn incense and invoke:\n\n*\"Great Dao, Heavenly Worthy, deign to bestow sacred protection. May the Mountain Spirit King and the Sweet Dew Sea Spirit hold cups of crimson jasper blossoms to fill this disciple’s elixir draught, that upon drinking, I may prolong life and regain youth, thereby greatly aiding all living beings and fulfilling loyalty and filial piety to sovereign and father.\"*\n\nOnce the invocation is complete, take seven bundles of white cogon grass, divide into seven mounds, and on each spread seven *chi* of crimson silk. Place seven silver cups, each filled with nine *ge* of the elixir nectar, upon the mounds. Chant:\n\n*\"Supreme Clarity’s wondrous nectar, essence bestowed by the Great Mystery. I now diligently consume it, that I may attain long life.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, gather the nectar from the cups into one large vessel of the Five Worthies, divide into three doses, and consume—this will invigorate the body greatly.\n\nAfter the first ten days of consumption, the body will perspire profusely. After ten more days, the sweat will cease, and the body will grow increasingly fragrant and smooth as lapis lazuli. By sixty days, the bones will gleam with fresh luster. At seventy days, the cinnabar field will shine brightly. At ninety days, the complexion will bloom like peach and plum. By a hundred days, hoary hair will turn black. After half a year, an octogenarian will resemble a man of thirty in vigor, with the strength of a hundred men. After one year, spirit and understanding will merge. After two years, one may become an earthbound immortal. After three years, ascension upon clouds may be achieved.\n\nThere is no fixed time for consuming this elixir—take it as soon as possible, adjusting the dosage according to one’s constitution. If one consumes up to ten *shi*, the bones and marrow will be wholly transformed into those of an immortal.\n\nThis formula is supremely wondrous; its treasures must not be recklessly transmitted. Should it be lightly divulged, calamity will befall seven generations of ancestors. It is not to be imparted to the unworthy but only to the great immortal Yin Xi. Once received with reverence, one may journey to grotto-heavens where all immortals who partake of this elixir soar aloft. Should one wish to summon the myriad immortals as teachers and have all spirits as attendants, take powdered white dragon bone mixed with red gold powder. There are no prohibitions.\n\nHowever, one must maintain purity when compounding it, avoiding foul odors and strictly adhering to the methods of immortals. The detailed instructions for preparing the elixir are recorded in a separate scroll.\n\n**Secret of Gathering Medicinal Sprouts**\nFrom the first day of the first month onward, gather the sprouts of a hundred herbs from sunny slopes—these are the fresh sprouts of medicinal herbs, including all varieties of grasses.
