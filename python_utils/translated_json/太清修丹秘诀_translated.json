Then, in the following first lunar month, one observes a prolonged fast and abstains from anger and desire—this \"prolonged fast\" refers to restraining the upper desires.\n\nIn the second month, the cinnabar is sown, and the fasting practices are maintained. The method for sowing cinnabar is as follows: after midnight and before noon, first perform the usual *daoyin* exercises, then exhale with the \"xu\" sound eight times. Next, gather saliva and rinse the mouth until it is abundant, waiting until one has swallowed a hundred mouthfuls. Swallow from the left side, guiding it slowly downward with the mind until it reaches the *dantian*. Then, descend the heart-fire, rotating leftward eighty-one times. For the sowing medicine, gather and rinse the saliva at least seven times; if one has strength remaining, there is no limit to the number of mouthfuls, but one should proceed according to one’s capacity.\n\nWithin seven days, the golden cinnabar will descend. From then on, use fifteen white, fine porcelain basins day and night, each covered with a paper lid labeled with the day’s number. When all basins are filled, begin with the first one to wash and collect the golden cinnabar. Repeat this cycle, as the cinnabar accumulates over days, valuing its settling and coagulation. Each washing requires changing the water four or five times. Collect the cinnabar on ash paper, dry it over smoke, and store it. Half a catty is sufficient.\n\nIf the cinnabar collected in the second month is insufficient, continue gathering until the third month, stopping only when the required amount is reached. On the first day of the sixth month, follow the method of the twelfth month, again fortifying with fine wine, delicacies, and meat. From the first to the seventh month, observe a daily fast, abstaining from desire and anger. In the eighth month, perform the cinnabar-sowing method as in the second month, collecting half a catty of cinnabar as before. If the amount is still insufficient, continue until the ninth month, stopping only when the required amount is reached.\n\nThen, combine the golden cinnabar gathered in spring and autumn—one catty in total—and store it in a clean vessel, sealing it tightly. Wait until the tenth month to observe a prolonged fast, and on the first day of the eleventh month, begin the work. Divide the previous catty of medicine evenly into fifteen portions, and further divide each portion into three parts. Each day, at the hours of *zi*, *yin*, and *chen*, take one part three times. Begin on the first day and finish by the full moon.\n\nEach time the medicine is taken, first refine one portion in the mouth with saliva. Swallow three times on an empty stomach, then take the medicine, guiding it with the mind to the *dantian*. Circulate the fire according to the *Qian-Kun* strategy, taking three portions daily at the three designated times. After each dose, take a small amount of talcum powder with boiled saliva to suppress the cinnabar. Also, take a small amount of frankincense to facilitate the cinnabar’s movement.\n\nOn the days the cinnabar is taken, after noon, practice breath-holding and only circulate water—meaning only swallow saliva. From the day after the full moon onward, at the hours after *zi* and before *wu*, practice only breath-holding and qi circulation—meaning only swallow qi three times. After the end of the eleventh month, cease further practice. On the last and first days of each month, only hold the breath thirty-six times, exhaling when the qi reaches its limit.\n\nEach day, eat only two meals of plain, well-cooked white rice, no more than three *liang* in total—this is also considered a form of \"fire.\" Wait until the cinnabar no longer descends, signaling the completion of the work and the attainment of the \"leakless\" elixir. After the fifteenth day of the eleventh month, if the golden cinnabar is not yet mature but occasionally descends, one must intentionally gather it and not neglect or discard it, for the cinnabar already contains the efficacy of the method. Only when the golden cinnabar ceases to descend is the \"leakless elixir\" complete. The descended golden cinnabar should also be taken in turn.\n\nAfter the elixir is completed, one may eat and drink freely, taking several meals a day. When full, exhale to expel the food, which will gradually leave no residue or filth. Urination will cease, and one may go a full year without eating yet suffer no hunger or weakness, becoming an Earthly Immortal forever. The work is generally completed within one year.\n\nDuring the practice, if one experiences dizziness, blurred vision, or loose teeth, these are signs of excessive yang. Simply drink a thick decoction of licorice frequently to resolve it.\n\nThis is the secret method for golden cinnabar, a technique for refining the inner medicine that transforms the mortal body into that of an Earthly Immortal.\n\n---\n\n### **The True Lead Formula of the Great Medicine by Master Chongxu**\n\nCinnabar is formed from the essence of the sun and moon, congealing into substance. Since cinnabar can be refined to extract mercury, and mercury is the essence of the sun, cinnabar can also be used to gather lead, which is the qi of the moon. If one can extract the lead within cinnabar, it can be paired with the mercury within cinnabar to refine the supreme medicine, thus harmonizing yin and yang. This is the true mercury and true lead; refining them ensures success without fail.\n\nThus, Master Shentu’s three-character formula states:\n*Originally one thing, divided into two bodies—*\n*One resembles lead, the other mercury.*\n\nAn ancient adage says:\n*One mother bears two children—*\n*One son and one daughter.*\nThese two are lead and mercury.\n\nIf one obtains true lead and wishes to refine the supreme medicine, the furnace, crucible, fire timing, and methods of preparation and ingestion are all detailed in the various elixir classics. The only difficulty lies in recognizing this true lead.\n\nThe formula states:\n*The flowing golden essence nourishes the myriad spirits,*\n*Naturally achieving immortality and longevity.*\n*The divine medicine does not rely on external substances;*\n*Yin and yang restrain each other and naturally coalesce.*\n\n**Liver**\nFour positions balance under the sovereign’s rule,\nAlone dwelling in *jia-yi*, it claims supremacy.\nYet in the end, it yields to the fire within *li*,\nSuddenly entering the second gate of the southern palace.\n\n**Heart**\nSquare in shape, an inch in size, called the Hall of Spirit,\nThe virtue of fire generates it—how great!\nWait until the six yang numbers are complete,\nThen the true lead flows westward.\n\n**Lungs**\nExternally corresponding to the White Tiger of the west,\nAutumn’s qi congeals into the skin like frost.\nNow that the numinous harmony is attained,\nGradually the Original Lord’s Dao grows abundant.\n\n**Kidneys**\nA sea of jade waves lies in the north—\nWho could journey thus to the Metal Realm?\nSoon the Reverted Elixir will be complete,\nYet the work of ascending fire knows no measure.\n\n**Spleen**\nRadiant with five colors, stirring the golden essence,\nSweet and harmonious in flavor—here the medicine is formed.\nHow fine when the hundred spirits all bow in reverence,\nAs the Central Plain’s Son of Heaven celebrates peace and ascent.\n\n**Further Formula**\nThe cosmos is the primordial crucible, the medicine resides within the body,\nYin and yang unfathomable—this is called the numinous.\nPrimordial qi flies as frost through the nine transformations,\nThe Reverted Elixir is none other than the essence of Great Harmony.\n\nWhen the mists and rosy clouds wish to depart, how shall they depart?\nFirst, the golden essence must fly from behind the elbow.\nOnce the golden essence reaches the Upper Palace,\nThe Central and Lower Palaces all come to welcome it.\nNaturally, jade mercury trickles forth,\nRushing back to the Original Sea with thunderous roar.\nFrom this, husband and wife meet in harmony,\nJoy surges, leaping beyond all bounds.\nWater and fire unite, each half inquiring of the other,\nAnd in the end, Earth and Heaven are inverted to form *Tai*.\nThrough the double gates of the spine to the crown,\nThis is the root of the path of cultivation.\nThe Jade Pool’s nectar should be swallowed often,\nAs the Purple Mansion’s Original Lord ascends straight upward.\nLet the qi constantly surge through the joints,\nAnd naturally essence will solidify and the Valley Spirit abide.\nOne day, when drawn to the Land of Longevity,\nGratitude must be repaid to those who guided the way.\n\nNow, the true yang of fluids—clear, bright, sweet, and pure—\nFirst arises from the Cinnabar Origin,\nAnd from the true qi of the five viscera.\nIt can again generate the Cinnabar Origin\nAnd the true qi of the five viscera:\nEntering the liver, it becomes qi;\nEntering the heart, it generates blood;\nEntering the spleen, it produces the Yellow Sprout;\nEntering the lungs, it generates fluids;\nEntering the kidneys, it generates essence.\nIt replenishes the brain, strengthens the body,\nFortifies sinews and bones, brightens the complexion,\nFirms the skin, and prevents leakage or dissipation—\nThis is called *qi abiding*, this is called the Elixir,\nAnd thus the Original Spirit is attained.\n\nThe *Hunyuan Jing* states:\nHeaven and Earth fashioned humanity.\nThe father is Wood, his essence is Fire—\nThese two images are fundamentally one qi.\nWood is the ruler, Fire its function.\nThe mother is Metal, her essence is Water—\nMetal is the ruler, Water its function.\nFather and mother, essence and qi—\nThese four images, when they encounter Earth, generate one another;\nWithout Earth, they restrain one another.\nThe mother’s palace is true Earth.\nWhen the four images’ qi reach this palace,\nThey naturally harmonize and gather as treasure.\nSpirit, qi, and essence serve as the master of the body.\nSpirit is the qi of the spleen;\nQi is the qi of Metal and Water;\nEssence is the qi of Fire and Wood—\nThese are the Three Marvels of the human body.\n\nThe *Zhouhou Jue* states:\nYin and yang revolve, qi transforms into essence,\nEssence transforms into cinnabar, cinnabar into mercury,\nMercury into gold, gold into medicine—\nCalled Golden Sand, refined into the Reverted Elixir.\nThe qi of the Original Sea coalesces as Black Lead;\nThe qi of the left kidney coalesces as Red Lead.\n\n**The Two Applications of Kan and Li**\nThe formula states:\nTo attain longevity, cultivate the root of what gives you life,\nBeginning with essence and qi.\nEssence and qi coalesce to form the body—\nThus know the body as the root that receives qi,\nAnd qi as the root of the formed.\nYet qi, without form, has no means to take shape.\nAt the time of receiving primordial qi,\nIt lies hidden below the mother’s navel,\nIn the three months of chaos, the Mysterious Female is complete.\nThe Mysterious Female is the mouth and nose.\nOnce the Mysterious Female is established,\nLike a melon with its stem, yin infuses the mother’s qi,\nBeginning here.\nThe mother exhales, the child exhales with her;\nThe mother inhales, the child inhales with her.\nTen months pass in continuity, qi suffices, spirit is complete—\nThe fetus departs the mother, delighting in the child,\nUnaware that the body is depleting externally.\nTransforming from infant to child, pointing at the cheek and laughing.\nThe *Xianzhen Yi* states:\nThis is the root of losing the Dao.\nHow much more so when, at fifteen, one becomes a youth,\nAt twenty, a young man—\nEyes dazzled by the five colors,\nEars attuned to the five sounds,\nWielding intelligence and deploying spirit,\nScarcely pausing for breath—\nThus the root of pure simplicity is utterly lost.\nTherefore, the sage, knowing external pursuits are futile,\nReturns to the origin and reverts to the root,\nGrasping the fetal breath to attain the formula of longevity and immortality—\nIts principle is clear.\n\nThe *Zhongtai Jing* states:\nWithin the body, mother and child—why not guard them?\nThe body and qi are the mother, the spirit and qi are the child.\nThe body and qi are established first, then the spirit arises.\nSpirit and qi move together,\nCirculating among the viscera,\nDirecting breath upward and downward.\nWith long practice,\nThe spirit becomes luminous, the qi harmonious.\nWhen the spirit is luminous, it illumines the five viscera;\nWhen the qi is harmonious, it flows through the four limbs.\nThus the *Huangdi Neijing* speaks of a single spirit-light,\nInternally generating the continuous five viscera—\nThis saying may be inferred and understood.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* states:\nImmortal and Daoist are not inherently numinous—\nAccumulating essence and amassing qi makes one true.\nAll these are its wonders.\nYet in today’s world, spirit and qi move separately,\nMother and child do not guard one another.\nThough qi breathes within, the spirit constantly operates without—\nThus qi follows impurity and dims,\nAnd primordial qi gradually scatters.\nFor the spirit is the master of the body,\nYet the master of the dwelling does not tend to the interior,\nBut spends each day externally—\nNaturally, the dwelling becomes empty and gradually deteriorates.\nThose who are not men of the Dao labor the spirit and toil the qi,\nNever resting for a breath within the body—\nThey are far from the Dao.\nWhen spirit and qi reach their destination,\nAnd mother and child circulate,\nThe gate of cultivation is not far off.\nThe two applications of Kan and Li—\nThus it is said: begin with the yang line in *Jiji*,\nBegin with the yin line in *Weiji*.\nThe two trigrams proceed together, cycling endlessly,\nSeizing the full work of Heaven and Earth’s creation—\nThis is the essential technique of the immortals’ life-mechanism.\nTherefore it is said:\nThe White Tiger is born from Kan,\nThe Azure Dragon lies hidden in Li.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Great indeed is Qian! Firm and strong, central and correct, purely refined and essence.\" This speaks of Qian’s body as pure yang, its nature utterly firm, its movement utterly strong, central, and correct—referring to the second and fifth lines—hence it is called \"firm, strong, central, and correct.\" For those who cultivate qi, they transform the water-fire images of *Jiji* and *Weiji*, making all six lines yang to complete the body of Qian, thus achieving purity. Pure and unadulterated, it becomes luminous and essence—hence it is called \"purely refined and essence.\"\n\nMoreover, the third and fifth lines are yang positions, symbols of generation, while the second, fourth, and sixth are yin positions, signifying gathering and restraint. Yang arises as fire, yin arises as water. In the human body, water and fire, when they intersect, are called *Jiji*. If one practices this hexagram, its efficacy equals that of all sixty-four hexagrams. As yang fire ascends and reaches its extreme, it generates yin; as yin water descends, it naturally generates yang. The fire dragon’s mercury, with its clear qi, spirals leftward; the water tiger’s lead, with its turbid qi, moves rightward—both circulating within the body. Yang’s seven returns to refine the golden elixir until *yin* (3–5 a.m.), yin’s nine reverts to restore the jade liquid until *zi* (11 p.m.–1 a.m.). These two substances naturally move—one counterflow, one compliant—entering the five viscera, permeating the body, ceaseless day and night. Thus one attains longevity, modeling oneself on Heaven and Earth. Therefore, Heaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed; Earth does not speak, yet the myriad things grow; humans do not speak, yet the supreme Dao is accomplished. Such oral instructions are not transmitted in writing. If one is fortunate enough to meet a like-minded seeker, one may briefly outline their general principles.\n\nThe Secret Instructions on Cultivating the Elixir of Great Clarity—here ends.",

      "translated_text": "**Lungs**\nExternally corresponding to the White Tiger of the west,\nAutumn’s qi congeals into the skin like frost.\nNow that the numinous harmony is attained,\nGradually the Original Lord’s Dao grows abundant.\n\n**Kidneys**\nA sea of jade waves lies in the north—\nWho could journey thus to the Metal Realm?\nSoon the Reverted Elixir will be complete,\nYet the work of ascending fire knows no measure.\n\n**Spleen**\nRadiant with five colors, stirring the golden essence,\nSweet and harmonious in flavor—here the medicine is formed.\nHow fine when the hundred spirits all bow in reverence,\nAs the Central Plain’s Son of Heaven celebrates peace and ascent.\n\n**Further Formula**\nThe cosmos is the primordial crucible, the medicine resides within the body,\nYin and yang unfathomable—this is called the numinous.\nPrimordial qi flies as frost through the nine transformations,\nThe Reverted Elixir is none other than the essence of Great Harmony.\n\nWhen the mists and rosy clouds wish to depart, how shall they depart?\nFirst, the golden essence must fly from behind the elbow.\nOnce the golden essence reaches the Upper Palace,\nThe Central and Lower Palaces all come to welcome it.\nNaturally, jade mercury trickles forth,\nRushing back to the Original Sea with thunderous roar.\nFrom this, husband and wife meet in harmony,\nJoy surges, leaping beyond all bounds.\nWater and fire unite, each half inquiring of the other,\nAnd in the end, Earth and Heaven are inverted to form *Tai*.\nThrough the double gates of the spine to the crown,\nThis is the root of the path of cultivation.\nThe Jade Pool’s nectar should be swallowed often,\nAs the Purple Mansion’s Original Lord ascends straight upward.\nLet the qi constantly surge through the joints,\nAnd naturally essence will solidify and the Valley Spirit abide.\nOne day, when drawn to the Land of Longevity,\nGratitude must be repaid to those who guided the way.\n\nNow, the true yang of fluids—clear, bright, sweet, and pure—\nFirst arises from the Cinnabar Origin,\nAnd from the true qi of the five viscera.\nIt can again generate the Cinnabar Origin\nAnd the true qi of the five viscera:\nEntering the liver, it becomes qi;\nEntering the heart, it generates blood;\nEntering the spleen, it produces the Yellow Sprout;\nEntering the lungs, it generates fluids;\nEntering the kidneys, it generates essence.\nIt replenishes the brain, strengthens the body,\nFortifies sinews and bones, brightens the complexion,\nFirms the skin, and prevents leakage or dissipation—\nThis is called *qi abiding*, this is called the Elixir,\nAnd thus the Original Spirit is attained.\n\nThe *Hunyuan Jing* states:\nHeaven and Earth fashioned humanity.\nThe father is Wood, his essence is Fire—\nThese two images are fundamentally one qi.\nWood is the ruler, Fire its function.\nThe mother is Metal, her essence is Water—\nMetal is the ruler, Water its function.\nFather and mother, essence and qi—\nThese four images, when they encounter Earth, generate one another;\nWithout Earth, they restrain one another.\nThe mother’s palace is true Earth.\nWhen the four images’ qi reach this palace,\nThey naturally harmonize and gather as treasure.\nSpirit, qi, and essence serve as the master of the body.\nSpirit is the qi of the spleen;\nQi is the qi of Metal and Water;\nEssence is the qi of Fire and Wood—\nThese are the Three Marvels of the human body.\n\nThe *Zhouhou Jue* states:\nYin and yang revolve, qi transforms into essence,\nEssence transforms into cinnabar, cinnabar into mercury,\nMercury into gold, gold into medicine—\nCalled Golden Sand, refined into the Reverted Elixir.\nThe qi of the Original Sea coalesces as Black Lead;\nThe qi of the left kidney coalesces as Red Lead.\n\n**The Two Applications of Kan and Li**\nThe formula states:\nTo attain longevity, cultivate the root of what gives you life,\nBeginning with essence and qi.\nEssence and qi coalesce to form the body—\nThus know the body as the root that receives qi,\nAnd qi as the root of the formed.\nYet qi, without form, has no means to take shape.\nAt the time of receiving primordial qi,\nIt lies hidden below the mother’s navel,\nIn the three months of chaos, the Mysterious Female is complete.\nThe Mysterious Female is the mouth and nose.\nOnce the Mysterious Female is established,\nLike a melon with its stem, yin infuses the mother’s qi,\nBeginning here.\nThe mother exhales, the child exhales with her;\nThe mother inhales, the child inhales with her.\nTen months pass in continuity, qi suffices, spirit is complete—\nThe fetus departs the mother, delighting in the child,\nUnaware that the body is depleting externally.\nTransforming from infant to child, pointing at the cheek and laughing.\nThe *Xianzhen Yi* states:\nThis is the root of losing the Dao.\nHow much more so when, at fifteen, one becomes a youth,\nAt twenty, a young man—\nEyes dazzled by the five colors,\nEars attuned to the five sounds,\nWielding intelligence and deploying spirit,\nScarcely pausing for breath—\nThus the root of pure simplicity is utterly lost.\nTherefore, the sage, knowing external pursuits are futile,\nReturns to the origin and reverts to the root,\nGrasping the fetal breath to attain the formula of longevity and immortality—\nIts principle is clear.\n\nThe *Zhongtai Jing* states:\nWithin the body, mother and child—why not guard them?\nThe body and qi are the mother, the spirit and qi are the child.\nThe body and qi are established first, then the spirit arises.\nSpirit and qi move together,\nCirculating among the viscera,\nDirecting breath upward and downward.\nWith long practice,\nThe spirit becomes luminous, the qi harmonious.\nWhen the spirit is luminous, it illumines the five viscera;\nWhen the qi is harmonious, it flows through the four limbs.\nThus the *Huangdi Neijing* speaks of a single spirit-light,\nInternally generating the continuous five viscera—\nThis saying may be inferred and understood.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* states:\nImmortal and Daoist are not inherently numinous—\nAccumulating essence and amassing qi makes one true.\nAll these are its wonders.\nYet in today’s world, spirit and qi move separately,\nMother and child do not guard one another.\nThough qi breathes within, the spirit constantly operates without—\nThus qi follows impurity and dims,\nAnd primordial qi gradually scatters.\nFor the spirit is the master of the body,\nYet the master of the dwelling does not tend to the interior,\nBut spends each day externally—\nNaturally, the dwelling becomes empty and gradually deteriorates.\nThose who are not men of the Dao labor the spirit and toil the qi,\nNever resting for a breath within the body—\nThey are far from the Dao.\nWhen spirit and qi reach their destination,\nAnd mother and child circulate,\nThe gate of cultivation is not far off.\nThe two applications of Kan and Li—\nThus it is said: begin with the yang line in *Jiji*,\nBegin with the yin line in *Weiji*.\nThe two trigrams proceed together, cycling endlessly,\nSeizing the full work of Heaven and Earth’s creation—\nThis is the essential technique of the immortals’ life-mechanism.\nTherefore it is said:\nThe White Tiger is born from Kan,\nThe Azure Dragon lies hidden in Li.",

      "translated_text": "The *Book of Changes* states: \"Great indeed is Qian! Firm and strong, central and correct, purely refined and essence.\" This speaks of Qian’s body as pure yang, its nature utterly firm, its movement utterly strong, central, and correct—referring to the second and fifth lines—hence it is called \"firm, strong, central, and correct.\" For those who cultivate qi, they transform the water-fire images of *Jiji* and *Weiji*, making all six lines yang to complete the body of Qian, thus achieving purity. Pure and unadulterated, it becomes luminous and essence—hence it is called \"purely refined and essence.\"\n\nMoreover, the third and fifth lines are yang positions, symbols of generation, while the second, fourth, and sixth are yin positions, signifying gathering and restraint. Yang arises as fire, yin arises as water. In the human body, water and fire, when they intersect, are called *Jiji*. If one practices this hexagram, its efficacy equals that of all sixty-four hexagrams. As yang fire ascends and reaches its extreme, it generates yin; as yin water descends, it naturally generates yang. The fire dragon’s mercury, with its clear qi, spirals leftward; the water tiger’s lead, with its turbid qi, moves rightward—both circulating within the body. Yang’s seven returns to refine the golden elixir until *yin* (3–5 a.m.), yin’s nine reverts to restore the jade liquid until *zi* (11 p.m.–1 a.m.). These two substances naturally move—one counterflow, one compliant—entering the five viscera, permeating the body, ceaseless day and night. Thus one attains longevity, modeling oneself on Heaven and Earth. Therefore, Heaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed; Earth does not speak, yet the myriad things grow; humans do not speak, yet the supreme Dao is accomplished.
