  "full_translation": "**Hymns of the Various Perfected**\n\n**Hymn to the Great Mystery Sutra of the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity**\nVermilion radiance illumines the cloud-court,\nPurple mist gleams through the jade grove.\nResplendent, the seven-jeweled blossoms,\nDazzling, the jade numinous tones.\nGong and shang harmonize of themselves,\nWondrous spirits open the human breast.\nMysterious chant sows the field of fortune,\nVastly ferrying the boundless heart.\n\n**Hymn to the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity**\nThe mysterious transformation leaves no trace,\nYet traces give rise to the ancestral Dao.\nRoaming the nine heavens’ verge,\nHalting his chariot at the six-ridge palace.\nThe Dao flows freely in the void and silence,\nNuminous songs arise in the great emptiness.\nForm responds to the court of utmost stillness,\nThought and chant commune through the subtle and fine.\n\n**Hymn to the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity**\nIn the dim dawn of primal transformation,\nFaintly the morning glow disperses.\nAbove the great stillness and empty mystery,\nThe two modes part in clarity and vastness.\nCongealing essence, embracing the empty womb,\nStructuring transformation, gestating numinous vision.\nHolding the real within to nurture the spirit,\nSuddenly the dark dawn breaks.\nOnly then is the sorrow of fleeting years realized,\nAs fate turns back toward the celestial Han.\n\n**Hymn to the Original Birth Sutra of Lord Lao**\nThe root-origin of all beings,\nStill and without arising or ceasing.\nWeak and lost, they stray from their root,\nThemselves sundered from the true source.\nFalsely creating bonds of good and evil,\nKarma’s retribution knows no end.\nTo overturn the sea of suffering,\nLet the river of craving run dry.\nGuard the One, firm in soft concentration,\nHold fast to this without flaw or lack.\nRight wisdom pervades all existence,\nWondrous insight shatters all knots.\nMyriad practices merge in return,\nThe three vehicles dissolve their divergent tracks.\nTrue stillness departs from dust and defilement,\nCool and serene, without affliction or heat.\n\n**Hymn to the Supreme Wisdom’s Return to the Mystery Sutra**\nNuminous immortals ride the auspicious clouds,\nMounting dragons, treading the dark waves.\nAccord with the real, manifesting fine omens,\nWashing their feet in the eight celestial rivers.\nFortune’s response does not await my seeking,\nThus they loosen the heavenly nets.\nVirtue crowns the three realms,\nEven the earthly snares are passed.\nMoved by encounter with the numinous assembly,\nPure wisdom flowers through the lotus.\n\n**Hymn to the Supreme Wisdom Sutra**\nTo learn immortality, sever ornate thoughts,\nEach thought building upon the last.\nComing and going disturb my spirit,\nSpirit restless, nothing remains unexperienced.\nExtinguish thoughts, rest in empty leisure,\nWhispering, enter the stillness of emptiness.\nSeek the sutras as if parched with thirst,\nHold your resolve firm as metal and stone.\nPreserve the child, soar the dark path,\nThe five spirits ferry you across the talismanic registers.\n\n**Hymn to the Sutra of the Fundamental Vows and Great Precepts**\nTo learn immortality, conduct is urgent,\nUphold the precepts to restrain the heart’s passions.\nLet the upright qi dwell in emptiness and ease,\nImmortal sages will naturally seek you out.\nIf you do not trust the Dharma’s words,\nWhy dwell in the mountain forests?\n\n**Song of the Jade Emperor’s Bestowal of the Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern and Ascension to the Dragon Terrace**\nHowling, the three auroras lead,\nCircling, the seven boundless canopies.\nEight luminaries enter the Grand Origin,\nFlying and scattering beyond the nine heavens.\nJade portals birth radiant clouds,\nNuminous mists dispel deep obscurity.\nIn the western palace, the Cavern Mystery is chanted,\nPure songs rise to the Fusang’s verge.\nAbiding in the feminine amidst towering peaks,\nMysterious hymns gather the Five Elders.\nSuddenly, a heart arises—\nWith you, I bind the central sash.\n\n**Second Stanza**\nThe gourd river stirs its azure vastness,\nThe celestial ford drums myriad streams.\nEight winds drive the divine auroras,\nFar and faint, roaming the void’s midst.\nChanting the Cavern Spirit’s luminous hymns,\nThe sound becomes your dark offering.\nSuddenly, the inevitable arises in conduct,\nElbow bent, hastening through the dust.\nHow bitter the heart’s toil—\nI shall tell you what you seek.\n\n**Hymn to the Scripture of the Purple Radiance and Transformations of the Blazing Light, Bestowed by the Queen Mother of the West**\nWhistling songs on the ninefold numinous terrace,\nCliff ridges congeal in chilly seclusion.\nThe mind’s principles course through the six senses,\nThe eyes abandon the dust’s turbid haze.\nFlowing auroras illuminate the golden chamber,\nThe empty hall disperses layered mysteries.\nAccumulated resonance summons the numinous descent,\nForm alone, yet the Dao also divides.\nCultivating the sudden, gazing across ten thousand kalpas,\nHow could one notice the passing of eons?\n\n**Second Stanza**\nLush gardens adorn the numinous steps,\nCrimson portals in the jade-forest court.\nFlowing winds drum the hollow vastness,\nJade pipes ride the void’s sighing.\nPurple mists coil through winding doors,\nVermilion radiance gleams on green carriages.\nFlying banners cluster beneath dark canopies,\nFeathered staves shine in the purple clarity.\nAscending the nine auroras’ verge,\nRoaming and playing in the phoenix city.\nGazing back, loving the secluded one,\nOne joy shared with the morning’s birth.\n\n**Third Stanza**\nReining in the bright radiance,\nFeasting in the wilds beyond the dark expanse.\nWandering, seeking the numinous person,\nJoining forms at the auroras’ verge.\nHand parting the crimson-mound portals,\nBright as the divine’s tranquil peace.\nGolden towers rise in towering splendor,\nPure radiance without dust or defilement.\nLoosening my robe on the dark terrace of Lang,\nFulfilling my heart’s true wish.\nShedding the three paths’ trials,\nPreserving refinement to secure old age.\n\n**Hymn to the Perfected of the Primordial One, the Natural Supreme and Mysterious One**\nMyriad wonders emerge from the Cavern Real,\nResplendent, illuminating the Grand Clarity.\nThose who uphold it are called immortals,\nTheir bodies forever enduring life.\nCarefree, they sport in the dark void,\nPalaces arrayed without form.\nLush and radiant, the seven-jeweled grove,\nGleaming with the sun and moon’s essence.\nDragons and unicorns gallop in crisscross flight,\nPhoenixes soar in mournful song.\nThe Supreme governs the purple terrace,\nThe Perfected chant the Cavern Sutra.\nPinching incense, bowing in reverence,\nCircling the palace city in procession.\nThree rounds return to the high seat,\nThe Dao King responds in kind.\nThe ruler who magnifies the supreme Dao,\nBrings universal peace beneath heaven.\n\n**Hymn to the Supreme’s Magnification of the Dao**\nThe Supreme’s dark and empty ancestral Dao,\nMagnifies its scriptures with reverence.\nLooking up and down, immortality is attained,\nPassing through kalpas without number.\nMajestic, the Grand Real’s virtue,\nStill, it arises from non-arising.\nAuroras weave the empty branches,\nRiding the void, naturally journeying.\nSun and moon shine with brilliant light,\nPeace and harmony, joy without end.\n\n**Songs of the Numinous Consort of the Eastern Flower Chamber of the Fangzhu Palace**\nPurple cassia grows in the jade garden,\nCrimson blossoms resound in mournful tones.\nThe moon-palace births the elixir’s abyss,\nWithin the sun lies the jade pool.\nTo the left, plucking the round numinous radiance,\nTo the right, grasping the vermilion aurora’s glow.\nFlowing gold illumines the crimson court,\nEight luminaries dispel the returning mists.\nGreen canopies float in bright clarity,\nCommanding staves to summon the Grand Tenuity.\nPhoenix essence, youthful and radiant,\nJade richness sates eternal hunger.\nGrasping the dawn, drawing the primordial simplicity,\nMounting the sudden, soaring the jade steps.\nInhaling and exhaling the six voids’ qi,\nJade maidens attend with towel and sash.\n\nPlucking the zither to summon southern clouds’ fan,\nFragrant winds stir embroidered robes.\nStriking the *shang* note, a hundred beasts dance,\nThe Six Heavens seize their numinous might.\nSwift as a minnow’s flick, a hundred million aeons,\nAge’s span towers in solemn grandeur.\nThe small fry yet uncooked in the cauldron—\nI speak my sorrow beneath the crags.\n\n**The Azure Lad, Great Lord, ever sings:**\nTo plant the root of extinction’s end,\nOne must uproot the self of birth and death.\nSighing, I sink to the Nine Springs,\nYet sit lamenting this bodily frame.\n\n**The Perfected of Great Voidity ever sings:**\nBeholding spirit borne by form,\nIt is as a chariot drawn by horses.\nWhen the chariot breaks and horses bolt,\nThe bond dissolves in a fleeting loan.\nMourn this world for knowing only this—\nNaught but the lament of wind and fire.\nSowing transgression on heaven’s net,\nReaping poison in hell’s depths.\n\n**The Perfected Lord Wang of Western City ever sings:**\nThe body is the spirit’s ferryboat,\nMoored at the shore, they must part ways.\nForm is not spirit’s eternal abode,\nSpirit is not form’s constant bearer.\nWandering the wheel of birth and death,\nOnly the heart’s hesitation brings suffering.\n\n**The Perfected Lord Wang of Lesser Existence ever sings:**\nLosing the Dao, one follows death’s ford,\nThe three souls stray from life’s path.\nLife’s days grow ever distant,\nDeath’s days come ever too soon.\nAlas, the wretched traveler,\nWhose root and flower are overturned.\nRising to join the scattered dust,\nHow can the horse know to return from withered age?\n\nThe four poems above—on the night of the Autumn Equinox’s Jade Terrace Grand Assembly—were sung by the Four Lords to harmonize with the celestial zither’s *Xuangou Guangshao* strains. Recounted by the Lady of Right Radiance.\n\n**Guo Sichao often rows a small boat in the pond, striking the hull to sing:**\nThe limpid pool girds the numinous peak,\nEndless groves lush with verdant green.\nDark crows soar o’er the secluded wilds,\nWords of awakening flow with ease.\nStroking the oars, riding the spirit-waves,\nI bow my head, yearning for the dawn wind.\nUnattained is the hour of liberation,\nI wander carefree in the hills and groves.\n\n**Second Song:**\nBeyond the Nine Abysses, the Wave Spirit,\nI refine the Dao to perfect my true self.\nI sheathe this numinous phoenix’s wings,\nConceal my radiant dragon’s scales.\nExalting this inch of heart,\nTen thousand gusts are but dust and grime.\nPity the ephemeral mayfly,\nWho can exhaust your chariot’s wheels?\n\n**Third Song:**\nRoaming the void, not swept by the whirlwind,\nMy spirit-steps tread the formless realm.\nThe round radiance gleams with bright auroras,\nNine phoenixes sing at dawn’s first light.\nBrandishing my pinions, I fan the Celestial Ford,\nObscure mists soar with felicitous clouds.\nThus I reach the Palace of Great Tenuity,\nSipping this golden pear nectar.\nWandering beyond the dark abysses,\nNeither abiding nor perishing.\n\n**Fourth Song:**\nDriving the sudden, dancing in the divine heavens,\nRobes of aurora gird the nine suns.\nThe High Emperor matches the dragon-wheel’s pace,\nThus I reach the Northern Flower Chamber.\nThe spirit-tiger dwells in the jade grove,\nWind and cloud merge as one.\nOpening and closing the gates of dark mystery,\nThe numinous transformations vanish in the unseen.\n\n**The Life-Preserving Immortal Lord instructs Xu Huya and Du Guangping, who often delight in song:**\nPure light veils the vast forest,\nThe hazy sun ascends the eastern aurora.\nMorning winds dance through the six mists,\nThe eight paths surge in exuberance.\n\nHow need the Five Peaks boast their beauty,\nWhen any famed mountain may yet rise sublime?\nWith delicate hands I gather the cavern’s bounty,\nMy heart nestles where hidden resurgence begins.\nExhaling and inhaling the primal qi of the womb,\nWho can surpass the mystery of the Dark and White?\n\n**The Queen Mother of the West feasts with Emperor Wu of Han; the Lady of the Supreme Prime plucks the Cloud-Forest zither and sings the \"Step-in-Void\" melody:**\nOnce I trod the Way of Dark Perfection,\nAscending in strides the Great Auroral Mists.\nShouldering my satchel, I reached Heaven’s Gate,\nAnd asked the whereabouts of the Supreme Lord’s abode.\nSuddenly I passed the Purple Tenuity Enclosure,\nWhere perfected beings stood thick as hemp.\nVerdant light stirred with the pure breeze,\nCloud-canopies gleamed with crimson blossoms.\nThe Orchid Palace unfolded its pearl fans,\nThe azure vault revealed its jasper sands.\nCinnabar terraces wove through empty branches,\nEyes flashed with radiant splendor.\nFlying phoenixes perched on ridgepole peaks,\nThe Torch Dragon leaned in sinuous repose.\nThe Jade Embryo brought forth crimson mushrooms,\nNine-hued hues tangled in profusion.\nDrawing in the light, I refined my immortal frame,\nThrough ten thousand kalpas I remained a child.\nWho speaks of life’s end before its time?\nEven Fusang is not yet a withered stump.\n\n**The Queen Mother of the West commands her attendant, the Fourth Consort Tian, to respond in song:**\nAt dawn I ascend the Palace of Great Numinosity,\nDrawing in the eightfold royal orchids.\nAt dusk I enter the Gate of Dark Primordiality,\nPlucking blossoms and parting the langgan jades.\nMy feet tread the Gourd River’s ford,\nWhere the Weaving Maid stands by the ford’s basin.\nExhaling and inhaling, I embrace the luminous clouds,\nTheir savor sufficing for a single meal.\nHow thronged is the Purple Tenuity!\nJasper wheels bear vermilion cinnabar.\nAt dawn I depart from the Vast Obscurity Mansion,\nAt dusk I lodge within the Enclosure of the Curved Array.\nOur paths diverge, each following its own Dao,\nYet each embodies what brings contentment.\nThe Two Modes endure as ever—\nWhy doubt the aeons of the great camphor tree?\nSpeak not of this to worldly men,\nFor the walking corpses would find these words hard to bear.\n\n**The Queen Mother presents a song to the Lady Wei:**\nI harness my Eightfold Auroral Chariot,\nSwiftly entering the Jade Purity.\nDragon skirts sweep the celestial river,\nTiger banners command the vermilion hosts.\nWandering the margins of the Dark Ford,\nTen thousand currents never pause for a moment.\nI grieve this parting and reunion,\nFor when the kalpa ends, heaven and earth collapse.\nOnly when the Light within Nothingness is exhausted\nDoes death—and life—cease to be.\nEmbodying the Dao of spontaneity,\nIn silent contemplation I merge with the Great Obscurity.\nFrom the Southern Peak rises a true pillar,\nJade radiance gleams with luminous essence.\nFree from tasks without term,\nAn empty heart naturally receives the numinous.\nA joyous gathering within the Crimson River—\nTogether we delight without end.\n\n**The Twin Ritualists pluck the Pearl-Cloud zither and respond in song:**\nFrom the Nine Heavens emerges Jade Purity,\nDivine tresses trail beyond the flying auroras.\nThe Auroral Terrace gleams in towering splendor,\nThe Numinous Summer luxuriates in lush obscurity.\nFivefold clouds stir with emerald radiance,\nEight winds fan the verdant qi.\nLooking up, I chant to dispel demonic influences;\nLooking down, I study wisdom and insight.\nTen thousand perfected beings usher in the morning light,\nSinging of the meeting in the Crimson Chamber.\nA peerless one of virtuous resonance,\nHer divine radiance sweeps away all hindrance.\nThe Heavenly Peak soars through empty branches,\nThe Terrace’s depths plunge into profound seclusion.\nRoaming the sea, I grasp the well’s narrowness;\nTreading the real, I sense the world’s defilement.\nDancing wheels feast in layered emptiness—\nThe fish-trap and fish both naturally fade.\nTurn me toward the great camphor’s embrace,\nThat I may forever bid farewell to the ephemeral world of morning-born creatures.\n\n**The High Immortals gaze upon the \"Wandering the Cavern-Spirit\" melody:**\nThe Jade Chamber gleams with eastern auroras,\nThe purple chariot floats in the crimson dawn.\nHow dazzling the Flowery Terrace to the eye—\nIn the northern banquet, flying immortals abound.\nWithin the Great Void of purity and stillness,\nI tread the subtle shifts of light.\nChanting the Great Cavern’s verses,\nI sing these twenty-seven stanzas.\nThe melody rests within the vast desert,\nThe Spirit King dwells in the inch-square heart.\nIn the silent chamber, I yearn for the numinous glow—\nWhy trouble over forests and mountains?\nIn an instant, the withered elder transforms,\nReverting to the visage of a child.\n\n**Four Perfected Beings descend to the Lady Wei in song:**\nCinnabar brightness illumines the Upper Clarity,\nEight winds stir the great auroras.\nI turn my divine auroral chariot,\nThus reaching the jasper slopes of the Jade Ridge.\nBeyond heaven and earth in a breath—\nThe nine circuits are all my home.\nAbove, I gather the essence of the sun’s heart;\nBelow, I drink the yellow radiance of the moon.\nIn the numinous contemplation of emptiness,\nThe roc’s path knows no gaps or crookedness.\nGlancing at you, Lady Wei of virtue,\nI see turbid qi harming your harmony.\nDiligently cultivate the thoughts of the Dark Within,\nAnd when the Dao is perfected, we shall meet again.\n\n**The Azure Lad’s song:**\nGreat auroras fan the morning glow,\nThe ninefold qi assume no fixed form.\nDark reins fly beyond the auroras,\nEightfold auroras ride the High Clarity.\nI grasp the Jade Emperor’s mantle,\nBearing me to life within the dawn.\nGazing upon the chambers of the Seven Luminaries,\nBright and clear, yet also dark and deep.\nTranscendent is the scion of the Wei clan,\nPossessing both heart and feeling.\nPeerless, he emerges from the joyous gathering,\nHis name inscribed in gold on the Eastern Flower.\nLady Wei, what you secretly cultivate—\nWe shall meet at the Yang Valley’s confluence.\n\n**Next, the Divine King of Fusang’s song:**\nAt dawn I open the Supreme Emperor’s chamber,\nLeaping beyond the Gourd River’s waters.\nThe azure sea flies with emerald waves,\nLinked peaks and crimson peaks stand in array.\nThe floating wheel rides the cloud-tides,\nNine dragons rise together in harness.\nTiger banners flourish at the auroral ford,\nA numinous wind suddenly sets all in order.\nHua Cun has long delighted in the Dao,\nThus attaining the likeness of high spirits.\nUprooted beyond the three bonds,\nThe meeting of resonance begins anew.\nWe shall meet at the Yang Luo Palace,\nAnd when the Dao is perfected, I shall bear the scion of Wei away.\n\n**Next, the Perfected of Pure Emptiness’ song:**\nSwiftly I rein in the Pure Emptiness,\nLingering in the Western Flowery Mansion.\nThe jasper grove already reaches the divine treetops,\nTiger banners scatter with the mist.\nWisdom winds shake the cinnabar pennants,\nBright torches illumine the eightfold radiance.\nUnfastening my robe within the Yong Chamber,\nDivine bells chime with resplendent brilliance.\nDwelling in the light like a forest branch,\nI pluck the nine strings within the Dark.\nYou have bequeathed me the sorrows of past lives,\nReleasing a thousand years of sighs.\nJoyful gazes know no bounds,\nThrough the night I await the dawn.\n\n**Its second stanza:**\nPurple auroras cherish the Dark Emptiness,\nA divine wind without guiding threads.\nSuddenly it fills the eight regions,\nPraying for your vast stillness.\nEight windows know no constant brightness—\nThere is obscurity, and there is light.\nContemplating the Three Cinnabar Fields,\nIn silence, form and radiance arise.\nConcentrating the spirit, I encounter the peerless,\nCloud-like bearing, towering and whole.\nAshamed I lack the skill of the Ying craftsman,\nFor that is but natural brilliance.\nDiligently and secretly cultivate the Dao of life,\nLest slackness and leakage weave calamitous qi.\nThe numinous meeting has its own time—\nWhen we clasp sleeves, we shall ascend together.\n\n**A lament for the mortal world:**\nBetween heaven and earth,\nMeetings are rare and fleeting.\nThe sun sets beyond the western mountains,\nEvening crows return in flight.\nA hundred years pass in a moment—\nAspirations and wishes go unfulfilled.\nThe Heavenly Palace lies but a foot away,\nYet I cannot follow—what sorrow!\n\n**The Ba Yao song:**\nThose who attain immortality, like Mao, first succeed,\nRiding dragons to ascend into the Great Clarity.\nAt times they descend to the Dark Continent, sporting on Red City,\nPassing through generations, their abundance ever mine.\nThe Lord Emperor studies this in the twelfth month of the year.\n\n**Shi Anqingxian’s poem:**\nThe numinous mountain reaches the great auroras,\nSteep cliffs pierce the auroral peaks.\n\nPurple mists scatter o’er the sacred land,\nRiding the whirlwind, mounted on a white dragon.\nWith the Four Companions we ascend as one,\nTo the eastern court of Lord Sanglin.\n\nThough Guangxiu’s years lie far behind,\nHis mighty spirit still rolls boundless.\nIn truth, he never yielded the path below,\nYet yielded his years in reverence.\n\n**Zhang Youshi’s poem:**\nNorthward to the vast desert’s edge,\nI come to ascend Penglai’s gates.\nPurple clouds frame the numinous palace,\nFragrant incense swirls thick and dense.\n\nHow fine is Luo Guangxiu,\nLong seated in the seat of Dao-discourse!\nBeside the Perfected in rows we gather,\nTogether beholding the white dragon’s flight.\nThe rites of the Four are now employed—\nWhen shall we together loosen our sashes?\nI cherish the friends who bare their hearts,\nJoyful in the radiant morning assembly.\n\n**Xu Yufu’s poem:**\nRoaming the wondrous mountain’s peaks,\nI rinse and bathe in the azure stream’s purity.\nFrom afar I glimpse Penglai’s realm,\nTowering, piercing the mists of heaven.\nFive sacred mushrooms clothe the crimson cliffs,\nFour terraces gleam with chessboard jade.\nNuminous blossoms scatter in profusion,\nTheir brilliance illuminating the divine court.\nAt ease beyond the Seven Awakenings,\nI freely embrace the celestial life.\nContent within my own heart’s square inch,\nWhy need the white dragon’s glory?\n\n**Ding Weining’s poem:**\nThe dark mountain frames the azure waves,\nGolden chambers mirror the numinous halls.\nLord Luo stands peerless in lofty aspiration,\nAt ease in the space between being and non-being.\nHis form sinks into the northern frigid vault,\nYet his three spirits commune with the Nine Heavens.\nOur colleagues follow one another forth,\nExalting me for my advanced years.\nIn youth, Shi Qing’an\nRefused to honor the worthy and esteemed.\nHe mocked the Lord of Penglai,\nCalling Guangxiu to the fore.\nO illustrious one, what will you do\nTo rebuff this young prodigy?\n\n**King Fuchai of Wu’s inscription:**\nDark currents flow with crimson waves,\nKun jade gleams upon Langya’s peaks.\nThe morning sun reins in dawn’s radiance,\nHow graceful and winding its splendor!\nWandering clouds descend upon the sun,\nThe whirlwind’s light soars through the Three Heavens.\nThe Numinous Treasure illumines the Nine Voids,\nYin and yang gather between the Zhong Mountains.\nYu the Great ascended the Eight Windows,\nDispersing his qi to resound through golden orchids.\nFollowing the branches, he shook the jade boughs,\nTracing the waves, he sought the flood’s source.\nSupporting the essence, he established the numinous trunk,\nHanging leaves to weave its abundance.\nVast and distant are the dragon and phoenix’s traces,\nTheir brilliance adorning the Nine Heavens’ script.\nI lift my gaze to the Three Luminaries’ essence,\nPreserving my body to seek eternal peace.\nBending down, I rinse with the Five Flowers’ elixir,\nRestoring my youthful countenance.\nSoaring through the Palace of Warmth and Coolness,\nHow could I know heat or cold?\nA thousand autumns are like a clear dawn,\nTen thousand years are but half a day.\nBeating my wings, I ascend through the void,\nBeckoning me to the Numinous Treasure’s halls.\nI burn the reins of the Five Emperors’ chariots,\nTogether we meet at the edge of the luminous desert.\nWe ask one another of hunger and thirst—\nThe dark springs overflow with flowing cinnabar.\nSeeking immortality lies within the heart’s square inch,\nThe Eight Distances hold no ease or difficulty.\nYet I hear the stench of the vermilion gates,\nAnd the perils that lie upon the road.\nI carve my inscription in the shade of the cliffs,\nWhere caves and gorges may be searched for traces.\n\n**Xin Xuanzi’s poem:**\nLong ago I entered the nether realm,\nAnswering the numinous summons in due course.\nMy spirit dispersed into emptiness,\nMy qi dissolved into the auspicious clouds.\nThis form is no lustrous jade—\nWhat master craftsman could carve it?\nWith cloven hooves I chant in secluded song,\nWith raised hands I play the singing branches.\nIn the forest chamber, joy unbounded,\nCutting off all ties beyond this pavilion.\nI leave my light to follow the round luminaries,\nYet how desolate the fine music sounds!\n\n**Second poem:**\nSilent communion stirs deep feeling,\nThe dark qi gathers and moves the sound.\nThough the lofty wheels vary in height,\nFrom ten thousand fathoms they still come to seek.\nO refined scholar of the Dao,\nIn spirit you harmonize with the numinous heart.\nYielding to the world’s ceaseless transformations,\nYour mind clings to the secluded grove.\nTogether we plan an excursion beyond the ordinary,\nJoining in stillness upon the eastern peak.\n\n**Third poem:**\nI command my chariot to the vast Feng’e,\nMy carefree traces wander the nether realm.\nIn emptiness there are indeed things,\nYet in being there is also impermanence.\nIn enlightenment, the boundary of being and non-being,\nTogether we meet at the Hao Bridge.\nAt a glance, the dark understanding is clear—\nThe principles of ghosts and spirits are self-forgotten.\n\n**Song of the Left Lady of the Great Tenuity’s Pure Void:**\nLush and dense, yet not the true abode,\nThe Great Origin is my dwelling.\nHow could the Dark Lord ever decay?\nOnly the solitary find this hard to bear.\nThe falling phoenix reins in the purple mist,\nIts proud bridle ascends the morning peaks.\nSilent, without bound or shore,\nRadiant, an empty vision in the void.\nHidden mushrooms flourish on Phoenix Hill,\nAs I linger by the jasper grove’s edge.\nThe dragon’s embryo enfolds your form,\nEight jades revolve in the pristine dawn.\nThe languorous blossoms of the jade palace,\nTheir clustered petals towering over the cliffs’ brilliance.\nThe roc’s fan spans a hundred million peaks,\nIts wings beating to support the sky’s flight.\nIn the western court, I command a long song,\nThe cloud zither cast aside, unstrummed.\nThe Eight Winds entwine the emerald palace,\nThe clustered mists suddenly disperse.\nThe numinous youth hurls flowing gold,\nA spark of fire ignites the departing case.\nThe Three Primes bow in dance,\nThe Purple Emperor waves his sleeves in praise.\nBright and clear, the radiance of the fan’s light,\nResplendent, the Long Star’s brilliance.\nMy chariot soars, its gleaming blades aloft,\nAs I glance down, moved to sorrow.\nI pity the earthbound immortals—\nWhy do they dwell in the forest streams?\n\n**Song of the Numinous Phoenix:**\nDim, dim the numinous phoenix,\nEndlessly it returns afar.\nLong, long my yearning,\nForever at odds with my wishes.\nThrough ten thousand kalpas, no appointed time—\nWhen will it come in flight?\n\nThen the phoenix slain by the king\nBurst forth in lush growth,\nEmbracing its daughter, they flew as one,\nStraight into the clouds they departed.\n\n**Zhang Liying the Female Immortal’s Stone Drum Song:**\nStone drum, O stone drum,\nHow sorrowful the world below!\nSince I came to behold it,\nThe lives of mortals are truly bitter.\nAlas for the affairs of the world,\nEndless my thoughts.\nMy thoughts cannot be humiliated,\nNor the king’s might seize them.\nMy will holds the luan and the phoenix,\nI sing and dance for myself,\nSoaring through the clouds, traversing the Han,\nFar beyond the dust and snares.\nO children of the world,\nWhat can you do to me?\nA brief meeting, then parting as fate decrees—\nFather, O mother,\nHow deeply you grieve my heart!\n\n**Song of the Han Child’s Rhyme:**\nDonning a blue skirt, she enters the Heavenly Gate,\nBows to the Golden Mother, pays homage to the Wood Lord.\nNone of the people of the time knew her,\nOnly Zhang Zifang recognized her and went to bow.\nHe said: “This is the Jade Youth of the Eastern King Father.”\nIt speaks of immortals who attain the Dao and ascend to heaven,\nWho must bow to the Golden Mother and pay homage to the Wood Lord.\nNone but those who ascend through emptiness and attain perfection\nKnow the ford to this realm.\n\n**E Lühua’s Poem Presented to Yang Quan:**\nThe divine peaks rise to cleave the clouds,\nSoaring peaks stand a thousand fathoms tall.\nThe numinous valley lies desolate and vast,\nThe jasper grove lush and dense.\nYang, your beauty and elegance shine,\nIn youth your pure voice flows.\nYou nest your heart in Zhuangzi and Hui Shi’s ford,\nTranscending form in Wei’s forest.\nYour radiance gleams within the vermilion gates,\nWithin and without, you surpass the common heart.\n\n**Second Poem:**\nOur bond with you, Master, runs deep—\nfrom the same pool our lineages spring.\nYet the great ancestral enterprise\nhas branched apart by now.\nLike gold and orchid bound by love,\nthe Three Friendships grow ever clearer.\n\n**Third Poem:**\nIn quiet seeking, this meeting brings joy,\nour refined threads woven through the years.\nWho says the hidden mirror is hard to find?\nIt lies within the square inch of the heart.\nBeyond the cage, we yearn to soar,\nboth to become mountain recluses.\nLet not your wings rise too high on the void,\nlest the startled wind sweep you away.\nTransformation depends on man,\nyet the fenced sheep cannot be compared.\nWhat I seek is no fleeting bloom—\nin you, my hope endures till life’s close.\n\n**Poem Presented by Lady An of Jiuhua to Yang Siming:**\nCloud-palaced towers pierce the empty sky,\njasper terraces rise in layered splendor.\nThe Purple Palace rides the green radiance,\nthe numinous halls stand lofty and grand.\nWithin the vermilion chambers of jade portals,\nsupreme virtue shines like crimson mist.\nBelow, I rinse my mouth with the sacred flask’s stream;\nabove, I pluck the azure *bi* blossoms.\nI bathe my feet in the Jade Celestial Pool,\nand strike the stalks by the River of the Herd Boy.\nThen I urge my cloud-chariot on,\nletting the dragon reins fall to the dark slope.\nI shake my robes at the dust’s edge,\nlifting my skirts to tread the turbid waves.\nWould that we bind ourselves to mountain and marsh,\nhard and soft in perfect harmony.\nHand in hand within the realm of dual purity,\nthe perfected Way strays not from truth.\nIn the Purple Tenuity, we meet in wise counsel,\nour songs and offerings bring boundless fortune.\n\n**Second Poem:**\nSwiftly I depart from the Western Flower,\nbetween the waiting and the unwaiting.\nNow I glance at the Five Peaks,\nnow I bathe in the Celestial River’s ford.\nI release the wheel to seek the empty boat—\nwherever I go, all is bound in tenderness.\nA mustard seed holds ten thousand acres,\nwithin it, Mount Kunlun stands.\nGreat and small are not truly different,\nnear and far share the same cause.\nThey come as those who wait,\nI come as one who needs no waiting.\n\n**Poem by the Lady of the Central Watchpost, Wang:**\nDragon banners dance in the Great Void,\nflying wheels trace the Five Peaks’ slopes.\nWherever I go, all is carefree—\ninspired, I sing dark and mysterious songs.\nThe unwaiting explains the waiting,\nand so we meet in harmony.\nWhy speak of the Canglang’s vastness?\nThe Dark Well is not too much.\nIn the space of a single step, all is gathered—\nthe Four Seas’ net embraces all.\nHow can it compare to beyond the radiant?\nOnly once in three kalpas does it pass.\n\n**Second Poem:**\nThe Eight Paths meet where no origin is,\nriding fate to survey the clamor.\nAmid the floating dust’s midst,\nI loosen my collar to join the Daoist family.\nA glance at the mist—suddenly it clears,\nand I lead the perfected to the numinous slope.\nThe empty radiance coils through jasper portals,\nthe dark harmony sings the phoenix’s song.\nThe path is free of ruts or hindrance,\nthe divine music dances on cloud-waves.\nEqual in virtue with the jade radiance,\nwhy need the world’s excess?\n\n**Third Poem:**\nSimply observe the celestial truth,\ncast off burdens and let passions flow.\nIn stillness, the four steeds of mechanism cease;\nin revering being, one preserves life.\nHow can one find the equalizer of things,\nto entrust fate to its course?\n\n**Fourth Poem:**\nMounting the chariot, I depart from the Eastern Flower,\nthe whirlwind fans the Great Mystery.\nFlying reins soar ninety thousand *li*,\nthe eight directions are already leveled.\nA fleeting glance at the mountains and waters,\nin the depths of the numinous peaks.\nOf one wind, the qi naturally aligns;\nwhere the Dao unites, principle is the same.\nSeeking the dragon’s fungus for distant years,\ninward vision gathers the celestial truth.\nThe Eastern Summit may long remain still—\nwhy be entangled by things?\n\n**Poem by Lady Li of Fangzhang’s Luminous One:**\nCloud ramparts gird the celestial gates,\nthe Seven Qi shine with divine might.\nJasper doors open at dawn’s cry,\nthe Nine Harmonies resound in the crimson pivot.\nPurple mist and vermilion gates,\nfragrant smoke rises from green windows.\nFour chariots dance with tiger banners,\nblue carriages wheel through the dark void.\nCanopies follow the clouds’ ranks,\nphoenixes descend to rein in six dragons.\nUrging my radiance along the Five Peaks’ slopes,\nthe Three Purities gaze upon your chamber.\nSuddenly I sense the foul and restless qi,\na thousand impurities defile my breast.\nFetid things taint the spirit,\nclamorous dust clashes in turmoil.\nBright jade all gleams resplendent—\nwhy should my body alone bear such weight?\nToo late I raise my hands in regret,\nsitting on the earth, worms breed within.\n\n**Second Poem:**\nI drink deeply, observing the crowd’s wisdom,\nswiftly draining the four directions’ bounds.\nUnknowing of how it came to be,\ntruly, this is no journey of waiting.\nAll encounters bring joy,\nno meeting brings sorrow.\nOur forms drift in the dark void,\ntwo gatherings naturally paired.\n\n**Third Poem:**\nFlying wheels ascend the morning terrace,\nreining in the dark mound’s edge.\nHand in hand with the Purple Emperor’s robe,\nsuddenly the Eight Winds drive me on.\nJade splendor wings the green curtains,\nblue skirts fan the emerald hem.\nCrowns gleam on towering peaks,\ngirdles tinkle with moon-pearls.\nLightly I enter the wind and dust,\nblocking my nose to escape what must be cast off.\nFoul stench withers my qi,\nthe hundred ills trouble my heart’s root.\nWhy not rise on the whirlwind,\ntreading the Great Void with a sigh?\n\n**Poem Presented by the Lady of the Southern Culmen to Yang Xi:**\nReining the whirlwind, I fan the Great Void,\nthe Eight Radiant Ones fly in lofty purity.\nAbove, I float beyond the Purple Dawn;\nbelow, I gaze upon the distant fall of the Milky Way.\nThe dark heart dwells in the space between,\nabove and below, no drifting or pause.\nBetween the two bounds of waiting and unwaiting,\nthe waiting has nothing to seek.\nEmbodying nonbeing, one may die;\nembodying being, one preserves life.\nThe Eastern Guest joins the high song—\nwhat need to dispute the two modes of waiting?\n\n**Poem Presented by the Lady of the Southern Culmen to Yang Xi (continued):**\n\nI command the jade-brocade wheels, reins dancing as I gaze in lingering loops.\nAt dawn I wander the Vermilion Fire Palace,\nat dusk I feast by the Radiant Night Pool.\nFloating light grazes the tips of rosy clouds,\neight dragons arrayed in uneven ranks.\nI roam as one unbound by waiting,\nyet the bound follow close behind.\nIn the high assembly, fair ones slumber—\nthe two modes of waiting vie in right and wrong.\nBeing and nonbeing lack fixed decree;\neach mode of waiting returns to its own.\n*(III)*\n\nThe forest stirs at the brush of a beard,\nclouds thicken awaiting the dragon’s song.\nMysterious numbers seek one another,\nevery touch of rhythm yields its own sound.\nThe flying chariot emerges from Western Splendor,\nreins gathered in sudden pursuit.\nThough the Eight Distances offer no lack of joy,\nwe chant in unison, admiring the principle itself.\nYet mourning this realm within the Four Bounds,\na hundred sorrows weigh ever on my heart.\nTogether we roam the Northern Frigid Terrace,\nwhere the divine wind unfastens your robe.\n\n---\n\n**Poem by the Lady of the Purple Tenuity:**\nI ride the whirlwind to welcome the Nine Heavens,\nresting my chariot at the Three-Flower Ridge.\nThose who wait may linger and gaze,\nthose who do not wait remain steadfastly still.\nWhy toil over the vast blue-green waves—\nhow could it compare to leaping the Dark Well?\n\n*She chants again:*\nThe Tortoise Gate looms towering,\nthe Terrace of Walls cradles falling moon-pearls.\nSeated in ranks within the Nine Numinous Chambers,\nwe strike the jade chimes and chant the Great Void.\nJade flutes harmonize with my spirit,\ngolden nectar dissolves my cares.\n\n*She chants again:*\nFeasting deep in Eastern Splendor,\na thousand hundred melodies array the tuning-weights.\nThe Azure Lord summons me to rise,\nbowing low to seek the Forest Court.\nFeathered robes fan emerald radiance,\njade pendants chime in resonant clarity.\nTogether we point toward the High Dawn Palace,\npledging to meet in the image of the Dark.\n\n*She recounts her journey to the Dark Mound, chanting:*\nI soar beyond the crimson dawn,\nthe flying whirlwind bears me to the Northern Mound.\nDivine splendor illumines the Immortal Terrace,\nround luminaries tilt with the wind.\nI unfold the radiance to embrace the Cinnabar Prime,\nthe gate of light feeds on moon-essence.\nIntertwined beneath the cloud-forest canopy,\nmy vast carriage returns to childhood’s bloom.\nHow fleeting this dwelling in the formless—\nhow could right and wrong ever be contrived?\nThe world’s net entangles itself in strife—\nhow can one speak of nurturing life?\n\n---\n\n*On the sixth day of the ninth month, at dusk, the Cloud Forest descends once more, commanding Yang to take up his brush and compose:*\nI unyoke my wheels above the great rosy clouds,\ngather my reins to reach the Purple Mound.\nIn hand I grasp the qi of the Eight Heavens,\ncasting my body to float in empty space.\nOne glance surveys the web of creation,\na second gaze seeks the highest bounds.\nThe essentials of the Dao are already thus—\nthey can unravel a thousand sorrows.\nSeeking truth, I have found a true friend—\nwhat more could I ask?\n\n*Chanting this, she bids it be shown to Director Xu Mu and Xi Fanghui. She chants again:*\nThe purple void gleams with dark radiance,\nthe Dark Palace girdled by the Crimson River.\nIn solemn ranks the Upper Clarity chambers,\nthe Numinous Terrace shines in towering splendor.\nEight chariots arrive at the Vermilion Pool,\nfeathered canopies tilt toward the branches of dawn.\nThe thunderous wind circles the Three Mornings,\ngolden bells scatter jade blossoms.\nSeven reins descend the Nine Depths—\nfeasting and gazing need no home.\nI ask the seeker of the Dao:\nwhy linger in the dusty waves?\nCould you not perch on Eastern Splendor,\ncultivating truth to gather the Great Harmony?\n\n*She also commands it be shown to Xu and Xi. On the eighteenth day of the tenth month, descending once more with the assembly, she commands Yang to write:*\nIn my left hand I grasp the Jade-Flower Canopy,\nflying light treading the Seven Primes.\nThe Three Mornings blaze with purple radiance,\nmy refining gaze caresses the Luminous Perfected.\nIn a moment of leaping transformation,\nall four directions become divine.\nThe numinous hair knows no bounds—\ndiligently ponder the texts of Upper Clarity.\nWhy tarry on the crossroads,\nletting your focus drift and stray?\nYin’s infirmities lose the dark mechanism,\nunaware as the years and months divide.\n\n*She addresses Yang:*\nThose who are diligent must diligently attend to their task, approaching its dark subtleties. The cautious, too, act in accord with their kind. The difficulty of studying the Dao cannot be put into words. Those who feel shame at the vulgar are still far from the Way—only after thorough cultivation can one be deemed worthy. The worthy lift their eyes to begin anew. For now, you must inwardly forget.\n\n*She chants:*\nGazing into the dark and distant clarity,\nthe setting light emerges from the eastern stillness.\nWould that I might find a friend beyond the dust,\nwhose rustling presence shuns worldly contrivance.\n\n*Chanting this again and again, she continues:*\nThe numinous person hides on the Dark Peak,\nthe perfected one conceals himself in the clouds.\nThe dark chant is not without its season,\nthe wondrous response has its own waiting.\nWho could have foreseen the emptiness and silence—\nthe ultimate melody abides in constancy.\nHand in hand we ascend the Feathered Palace,\nfeasting together within the Vast Cold.\nI ask: who are your companions?\nOnly the Jade Maidens remain.\n\n*Chanting complete, she says:*\nThe soaring steed of empty clouds\nspreads its wings above the Hollow Peak.\nSuch a one—how could he not long draw from the southern face,\nforsaking the thousand chariots?\n\n---\n\n*On the thirtieth day of the second month, she chants a verse:*\nGathering my robes to ford the Green River,\nI meet the Lord of Fusang.\nIn high assembly at the Great Forest Wilderness,\nwe feast and admire the Dark Flower Palace.\nIf your faith in the Dao is pure and steadfast,\nwhy not dwell on Eastern Peak?\n\n---\n\n*On the fourteenth day of the fourth month, she composes seven verses:*\n\n**I**\nI rein in the light to first cross the ford,\nthe flying whirlwind ascends Upper Clarity.\nThe Cloud Terrace rises in towering splendor,\nthe Gate of Heaven gleams with jade walls.\nThe morning wind stirs the cinnabar clouds,\ncrimson mist scatters across the golden court.\nGreen leaves gather on the Dark Peak,\npurple mushrooms sprout beneath the crags.\nAuspicious clouds coil around the cinnabar furnace,\nrefined jade scatters eightfold jasper.\nFeasting and gazing in the Vast Cold Palace,\nten thousand plants renew youth’s bloom.\nDragon banners unfurl numinous lightning,\ntiger banners summon the vermilion troops.\nThe exalted perfected turn the Nine Luminaries,\nthe cavernous gaze equalizes the hidden and bright.\nWho can tread the secluded path,\nseeking my boundless years?\n\n**II**\nMisty haze veils the Purple Tenuity Lodge,\nthe Terrace of Light disperses the whirlwind’s radiance.\nPhoenix songs echo amid the flowered canopies,\nphoenix hooks lead the dragon’s court.\nEight wolves bear the crimson banners,\nwhite tigers blow the horn-flutes.\nClouds surge to depict the numinous palace,\ncoming to rest amid the world’s clamor.\nI unyoke my reins at the fair ones’ abode,\nkindred spirits naturally summon one another.\nSeeking the lineage takes but a moment—\nten thousand years are but a single dawn.\nThe plant’s lifespan meets its decline,\nhow could the passing kalpas be deemed distant?\nThe true gaze one another—\nlet not your heart be plundered.\nThe empty blade swings toward the ultimate void,\nthe vulgar stagnation saddens the Five Spirits.\n\n**III**\nAt dawn I open the eastern morning’s radiance,\nthe flying chariot crosses the vast blue-green.\nMountain waves shake the azure shores,\nthe Eight Winds fan the dark mist.\nThe winding paths shift to the changing chambers,\ncherishing the truth moves the perfected.\nThree golds may roam the tray—\nEastern Summit is fit for eternal refinement.\nAmid the tumult on the road,\nwho can tread the ford of life?\n\n**IV**\nSwaying across the Eight Rosy Ridges,\nlingering beneath the flying morning canopy.\nThe purple chariot soars through the Great Void,\ngazing and laughing beyond the Nine Voids.\nJade flutes stir the radiant clouds,\nthe numinous mist severs the deep haze.\n\n**V**\nThe lofty immortals feast with the Supreme Perity,\ntheir pure songs stretch beyond all bounds.\nComing and going through the courts of mountains and peaks—\nwhy should there be any waiting or encounter?\n\n**VI**\nDivine jade gleams at the numinous ford,\nthe Seven Primes illumine the spirit’s gate.\nEmpty shifts dwell within the square inch,\na single leap ascends to the Great Tenuity.\nExquisite tones ride the harmonious chant,\nthe grand assembly too has its mechanism.\nEqual this gaze of heaven and man,\nin concert with the soaring morning radiance.\nReining the six directions beyond the cosmos—\nhow could there be tilt or peril?\n\n**VII**\nThe fleeting feast lingers on the Dust-Gale Ridge,\ntransformation and decline trace the cycle of return.\nWho knows the span of the kalpa’s turning?\nA glance back stirs human sorrow.\n\n**VIII**\nCloud-herbs shade the dark quadrant,\ngazing up, one feels the revolving luminous essence.\nLush and thriving, the flourishing sprouts—\nhe who bears double virtue must surely prosper.\nThe hymns of the perfected ones now conclude.",

      "translated_text": "**Hymns of the Various Perfected**\n\n**Hymn to the Great Mystery Sutra of the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity**\nVermilion radiance illumines the cloud-court,\nPurple mist gleams through the jade grove.\nResplendent, the seven-jeweled blossoms,\nDazzling, the jade numinous tones.\nGong and shang harmonize of themselves,\nWondrous spirits open the human breast.\nMysterious chant sows the field of fortune,\nVastly ferrying the boundless heart.\n\n**Hymn to the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity**\nThe mysterious transformation leaves no trace,\nYet traces give rise to the ancestral Dao.\nRoaming the nine heavens’ verge,\nHalting his chariot at the six-ridge palace.\nThe Dao flows freely in the void and silence,\nNuminous songs arise in the great emptiness.\nForm responds to the court of utmost stillness,\nThought and chant commune through the subtle and fine.\n\n**Hymn to the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity**\nIn the dim dawn of primal transformation,\nFaintly the morning glow disperses.\nAbove the great stillness and empty mystery,\nThe two modes part in clarity and vastness.\nCongealing essence, embracing the empty womb,\nStructuring transformation, gestating numinous vision.\nHolding the real within to nurture the spirit,\nSuddenly the dark dawn breaks.\nOnly then is the sorrow of fleeting years realized,\nAs fate turns back toward the celestial Han.\n\n**Hymn to the Original Birth Sutra of Lord Lao**\nThe root-origin of all beings,\nStill and without arising or ceasing.\nWeak and lost, they stray from their root,\nThemselves sundered from the true source.\nFalsely creating bonds of good and evil,\nKarma’s retribution knows no end.\nTo overturn the sea of suffering,\nLet the river of craving run dry.\nGuard the One, firm in soft concentration,\nHold fast to this without flaw or lack.\nRight wisdom pervades all existence,\nWondrous insight shatters all knots.\nMyriad practices merge in return,\nThe three vehicles dissolve their divergent tracks.\nTrue stillness departs from dust and defilement,\nCool and serene, without affliction or heat.\n\n**Hymn to the Supreme Wisdom’s Return to the Mystery Sutra**\nNuminous immortals ride the auspicious clouds,\nMounting dragons, treading the dark waves.\nAccord with the real, manifesting fine omens,\nWashing their feet in the eight celestial rivers.\nFortune’s response does not await my seeking,\nThus they loosen the heavenly nets.\nVirtue crowns the three realms,\nEven the earthly snares are passed.\nMoved by encounter with the numinous assembly,\nPure wisdom flowers through the lotus.\n\n**Hymn to the Supreme Wisdom Sutra**\nTo learn immortality, sever ornate thoughts,\nEach thought building upon the last.\nComing and going disturb my spirit,\nSpirit restless, nothing remains unexperienced.\nExtinguish thoughts, rest in empty leisure,\nWhispering, enter the stillness of emptiness.\nSeek the sutras as if parched with thirst,\nHold your resolve firm as metal and stone.\nPreserve the child, soar the dark path,\nThe five spirits ferry you across the talismanic registers.\n\n**Hymn to the Sutra of the Fundamental Vows and Great Precepts**\nTo learn immortality, conduct is urgent,\nUphold the precepts to restrain the heart’s passions.\nLet the upright qi dwell in emptiness and ease,\nImmortal sages will naturally seek you out.\nIf you do not trust the Dharma’s words,\nWhy dwell in the mountain forests?\n\n**Song of the Jade Emperor’s Bestowal of the Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern and Ascension to the Dragon Terrace**\nHowling, the three auroras lead,\nCircling, the seven boundless canopies.\nEight luminaries enter the Grand Origin,\nFlying and scattering beyond the nine heavens.\nJade portals birth radiant clouds,\nNuminous mists dispel deep obscurity.\nIn the western palace, the Cavern Mystery is chanted,\nPure songs rise to the Fusang’s verge.\nAbiding in the feminine amidst towering peaks,\nMysterious hymns gather the Five Elders.\nSuddenly, a heart arises—\nWith you, I bind the central sash.\n\n**Second Stanza**\nThe gourd river stirs its azure vastness,\nThe celestial ford drums myriad streams.\nEight winds drive the divine auroras,\nFar and faint, roaming the void’s midst.\nChanting the Cavern Spirit’s luminous hymns,\nThe sound becomes your dark offering.\nSuddenly, the inevitable arises in conduct,\nElbow bent, hastening through the dust.\nHow bitter the heart’s toil—\nI shall tell you what you seek.\n\n**Hymn to the Scripture of the Purple Radiance and Transformations of the Blazing Light, Bestowed by the Queen Mother of the West**\nWhistling songs on the ninefold numinous terrace,\nCliff ridges congeal in chilly seclusion.\nThe mind’s principles course through the six senses,\nThe eyes abandon the dust’s turbid haze.\nFlowing auroras illuminate the golden chamber,\nThe empty hall disperses layered mysteries.\nAccumulated resonance summons the numinous descent,\nForm alone, yet the Dao also divides.\nCultivating the sudden, gazing across ten thousand kalpas,\nHow could one notice the passing of eons?\n\n**Second Stanza**\nLush gardens adorn the numinous steps,\nCrimson portals in the jade-forest court.\nFlowing winds drum the hollow vastness,\nJade pipes ride the void’s sighing.\nPurple mists coil through winding doors,\nVermilion radiance gleams on green carriages.\nFlying banners cluster beneath dark canopies,\nFeathered staves shine in the purple clarity.\nAscending the nine auroras’ verge,\nRoaming and playing in the phoenix city.\nGazing back, loving the secluded one,\nOne joy shared with the morning’s birth.\n\n**Third Stanza**\nReining in the bright radiance,\nFeasting in the wilds beyond the dark expanse.\nWandering, seeking the numinous person,\nJoining forms at the auroras’ verge.\nHand parting the crimson-mound portals,\nBright as the divine’s tranquil peace.\nGolden towers rise in towering splendor,\nPure radiance without dust or defilement.\nLoosening my robe on the dark terrace of Lang,\nFulfilling my heart’s true wish.\nShedding the three paths’ trials,\nPreserving refinement to secure old age.\n\n**Hymn to the Perfected of the Primordial One, the Natural Supreme and Mysterious One**\nMyriad wonders emerge from the Cavern Real,\nResplendent, illuminating the Grand Clarity.\nThose who uphold it are called immortals,\nTheir bodies forever enduring life.\nCarefree, they sport in the dark void,\nPalaces arrayed without form.\nLush and radiant, the seven-jeweled grove,\nGleaming with the sun and moon’s essence.\nDragons and unicorns gallop in crisscross flight,\nPhoenixes soar in mournful song.\nThe Supreme governs the purple terrace,\nThe Perfected chant the Cavern Sutra.\nPinching incense, bowing in reverence,\nCircling the palace city in procession.\nThree rounds return to the high seat,\nThe Dao King responds in kind.\nThe ruler who magnifies the supreme Dao,\nBrings universal peace beneath heaven.\n\n**Hymn to the Supreme’s Magnification of the Dao**\nThe Supreme’s dark and empty ancestral Dao,\nMagnifies its scriptures with reverence.\nLooking up and down, immortality is attained,\nPassing through kalpas without number.\nMajestic, the Grand Real’s virtue,\nStill, it arises from non-arising.\nAuroras weave the empty branches,\nRiding the void, naturally journeying.\nSun and moon shine with brilliant light,\nPeace and harmony, joy without end.\n\n**Songs of the Numinous Consort of the Eastern Flower Chamber of the Fangzhu Palace**\nPurple cassia grows in the jade garden,\nCrimson blossoms resound in mournful tones.\nThe moon-palace births the elixir’s abyss,\nWithin the sun lies the jade pool.\nTo the left, plucking the round numinous radiance,\nTo the right, grasping the vermilion aurora’s glow.\nFlowing gold illumines the crimson court,\nEight luminaries dispel the returning mists.\nGreen canopies float in bright clarity,\nCommanding staves to summon the Grand Tenuity.\nPhoenix essence, youthful and radiant,\nJade richness sates eternal hunger.\nGrasping the dawn, drawing the primordial simplicity,\nMounting the sudden, soaring the jade steps.\nInhaling and exhaling the six voids’ qi,\nJade maidens attend with towel and sash.",

      "translated_text": "How need the Five Peaks boast their beauty,\nWhen any famed mountain may yet rise sublime?\nWith delicate hands I gather the cavern’s bounty,\nMy heart nestles where hidden resurgence begins.\nExhaling and inhaling the primal qi of the womb,\nWho can surpass the mystery of the Dark and White?\n\n**The Queen Mother of the West feasts with Emperor Wu of Han; the Lady of the Supreme Prime plucks the Cloud-Forest zither and sings the \"Step-in-Void\" melody:**\nOnce I trod the Way of Dark Perfection,\nAscending in strides the Great Auroral Mists.\nShouldering my satchel, I reached Heaven’s Gate,\nAnd asked the whereabouts of the Supreme Lord’s abode.\nSuddenly I passed the Purple Tenuity Enclosure,\nWhere perfected beings stood thick as hemp.\nVerdant light stirred with the pure breeze,\nCloud-canopies gleamed with crimson blossoms.\nThe Orchid Palace unfolded its pearl fans,\nThe azure vault revealed its jasper sands.\nCinnabar terraces wove through empty branches,\nEyes flashed with radiant splendor.\nFlying phoenixes perched on ridgepole peaks,\nThe Torch Dragon leaned in sinuous repose.\nThe Jade Embryo brought forth crimson mushrooms,\nNine-hued hues tangled in profusion.\nDrawing in the light, I refined my immortal frame,\nThrough ten thousand kalpas I remained a child.\nWho speaks of life’s end before its time?\nEven Fusang is not yet a withered stump.\n\n**The Queen Mother of the West commands her attendant, the Fourth Consort Tian, to respond in song:**\nAt dawn I ascend the Palace of Great Numinosity,\nDrawing in the eightfold royal orchids.\nAt dusk I enter the Gate of Dark Primordiality,\nPlucking blossoms and parting the langgan jades.\nMy feet tread the Gourd River’s ford,\nWhere the Weaving Maid stands by the ford’s basin.\nExhaling and inhaling, I embrace the luminous clouds,\nTheir savor sufficing for a single meal.\nHow thronged is the Purple Tenuity!\nJasper wheels bear vermilion cinnabar.\nAt dawn I depart from the Vast Obscurity Mansion,\nAt dusk I lodge within the Enclosure of the Curved Array.\nOur paths diverge, each following its own Dao,\nYet each embodies what brings contentment.\nThe Two Modes endure as ever—\nWhy doubt the aeons of the great camphor tree?\nSpeak not of this to worldly men,\nFor the walking corpses would find these words hard to bear.\n\n**The Queen Mother presents a song to the Lady Wei:**\nI harness my Eightfold Auroral Chariot,\nSwiftly entering the Jade Purity.\nDragon skirts sweep the celestial river,\nTiger banners command the vermilion hosts.\nWandering the margins of the Dark Ford,\nTen thousand currents never pause for a moment.\nI grieve this parting and reunion,\nFor when the kalpa ends, heaven and earth collapse.\nOnly when the Light within Nothingness is exhausted\nDoes death—and life—cease to be.\nEmbodying the Dao of spontaneity,\nIn silent contemplation I merge with the Great Obscurity.\nFrom the Southern Peak rises a true pillar,\nJade radiance gleams with luminous essence.\nFree from tasks without term,\nAn empty heart naturally receives the numinous.\nA joyous gathering within the Crimson River—\nTogether we delight without end.\n\n**The Twin Ritualists pluck the Pearl-Cloud zither and respond in song:**\nFrom the Nine Heavens emerges Jade Purity,\nDivine tresses trail beyond the flying auroras.\nThe Auroral Terrace gleams in towering splendor,\nThe Numinous Summer luxuriates in lush obscurity.\nFivefold clouds stir with emerald radiance,\nEight winds fan the verdant qi.\nLooking up, I chant to dispel demonic influences;\nLooking down, I study wisdom and insight.\nTen thousand perfected beings usher in the morning light,\nSinging of the meeting in the Crimson Chamber.\nA peerless one of virtuous resonance,\nHer divine radiance sweeps away all hindrance.\nThe Heavenly Peak soars through empty branches,\nThe Terrace’s depths plunge into profound seclusion.\nRoaming the sea, I grasp the well’s narrowness;\nTreading the real, I sense the world’s defilement.\nDancing wheels feast in layered emptiness—\nThe fish-trap and fish both naturally fade.\nTurn me toward the great camphor’s embrace,\nThat I may forever bid farewell to the ephemeral world of morning-born creatures.\n\n**The High Immortals gaze upon the \"Wandering the Cavern-Spirit\" melody:**\nThe Jade Chamber gleams with eastern auroras,\nThe purple chariot floats in the crimson dawn.\nHow dazzling the Flowery Terrace to the eye—\nIn the northern banquet, flying immortals abound.\nWithin the Great Void of purity and stillness,\nI tread the subtle shifts of light.\nChanting the Great Cavern’s verses,\nI sing these twenty-seven stanzas.\nThe melody rests within the vast desert,\nThe Spirit King dwells in the inch-square heart.\nIn the silent chamber, I yearn for the numinous glow—\nWhy trouble over forests and mountains?\nIn an instant, the withered elder transforms,\nReverting to the visage of a child.\n\n**Four Perfected Beings descend to the Lady Wei in song:**\nCinnabar brightness illumines the Upper Clarity,\nEight winds stir the great auroras.\nI turn my divine auroral chariot,\nThus reaching the jasper slopes of the Jade Ridge.\nBeyond heaven and earth in a breath—\nThe nine circuits are all my home.\nAbove, I gather the essence of the sun’s heart;\nBelow, I drink the yellow radiance of the moon.\nIn the numinous contemplation of emptiness,\nThe roc’s path knows no gaps or crookedness.\nGlancing at you, Lady Wei of virtue,\nI see turbid qi harming your harmony.\nDiligently cultivate the thoughts of the Dark Within,\nAnd when the Dao is perfected, we shall meet again.\n\n**The Azure Lad’s song:**\nGreat auroras fan the morning glow,\nThe ninefold qi assume no fixed form.\nDark reins fly beyond the auroras,\nEightfold auroras ride the High Clarity.\nI grasp the Jade Emperor’s mantle,\nBearing me to life within the dawn.\nGazing upon the chambers of the Seven Luminaries,\nBright and clear, yet also dark and deep.\nTranscendent is the scion of the Wei clan,\nPossessing both heart and feeling.\nPeerless, he emerges from the joyous gathering,\nHis name inscribed in gold on the Eastern Flower.\nLady Wei, what you secretly cultivate—\nWe shall meet at the Yang Valley’s confluence.\n\n**Next, the Divine King of Fusang’s song:**\nAt dawn I open the Supreme Emperor’s chamber,\nLeaping beyond the Gourd River’s waters.\nThe azure sea flies with emerald waves,\nLinked peaks and crimson peaks stand in array.\nThe floating wheel rides the cloud-tides,\nNine dragons rise together in harness.\nTiger banners flourish at the auroral ford,\nA numinous wind suddenly sets all in order.\nHua Cun has long delighted in the Dao,\nThus attaining the likeness of high spirits.\nUprooted beyond the three bonds,\nThe meeting of resonance begins anew.\nWe shall meet at the Yang Luo Palace,\nAnd when the Dao is perfected, I shall bear the scion of Wei away.\n\n**Next, the Perfected of Pure Emptiness’ song:**\nSwiftly I rein in the Pure Emptiness,\nLingering in the Western Flowery Mansion.\nThe jasper grove already reaches the divine treetops,\nTiger banners scatter with the mist.\nWisdom winds shake the cinnabar pennants,\nBright torches illumine the eightfold radiance.\nUnfastening my robe within the Yong Chamber,\nDivine bells chime with resplendent brilliance.\nDwelling in the light like a forest branch,\nI pluck the nine strings within the Dark.\nYou have bequeathed me the sorrows of past lives,\nReleasing a thousand years of sighs.\nJoyful gazes know no bounds,\nThrough the night I await the dawn.\n\n**Its second stanza:**\nPurple auroras cherish the Dark Emptiness,\nA divine wind without guiding threads.\nSuddenly it fills the eight regions,\nPraying for your vast stillness.\nEight windows know no constant brightness—\nThere is obscurity, and there is light.\nContemplating the Three Cinnabar Fields,\nIn silence, form and radiance arise.\nConcentrating the spirit, I encounter the peerless,\nCloud-like bearing, towering and whole.\nAshamed I lack the skill of the Ying craftsman,\nFor that is but natural brilliance.\nDiligently and secretly cultivate the Dao of life,\nLest slackness and leakage weave calamitous qi.\nThe numinous meeting has its own time—\nWhen we clasp sleeves, we shall ascend together.\n\n**A lament for the mortal world:**\nBetween heaven and earth,\nMeetings are rare and fleeting.\nThe sun sets beyond the western mountains,\nEvening crows return in flight.\nA hundred years pass in a moment—\nAspirations and wishes go unfulfilled.\nThe Heavenly Palace lies but a foot away,\nYet I cannot follow—what sorrow!\n\n**The Ba Yao song:**\nThose who attain immortality, like Mao, first succeed,\nRiding dragons to ascend into the Great Clarity.\nAt times they descend to the Dark Continent, sporting on Red City,\nPassing through generations, their abundance ever mine.\nThe Lord Emperor studies this in the twelfth month of the year.\n\n**Shi Anqingxian’s poem:**\nThe numinous mountain reaches the great auroras,\nSteep cliffs pierce the auroral peaks.",

command my chariot to the vast Feng’e,\nMy carefree traces wander the nether realm.\nIn emptiness there are indeed things,\nYet in being there is also impermanence.\nIn enlightenment, the boundary of being and non-being,\nTogether we meet at the Hao Bridge.\nAt a glance, the dark understanding is clear—\nThe principles of ghosts and spirits are self-forgotten.\n\n**Song of the Left Lady of the Great Tenuity’s Pure Void:**\nLush and dense, yet not the true abode,\nThe Great Origin is my dwelling.\nHow could the Dark Lord ever decay?\nOnly the solitary find this hard to bear.\nThe falling phoenix reins in the purple mist,\nIts proud bridle ascends the morning peaks.\nSilent, without bound or shore,\nRadiant, an empty vision in the void.\nHidden mushrooms flourish on Phoenix Hill,\nAs I linger by the jasper grove’s edge.\nThe dragon’s embryo enfolds your form,\nEight jades revolve in the pristine dawn.\nThe languorous blossoms of the jade palace,\nTheir clustered petals towering over the cliffs’ brilliance.\nThe roc’s fan spans a hundred million peaks,\nIts wings beating to support the sky’s flight.\nIn the western court, I command a long song,\nThe cloud zither cast aside, unstrummed.\nThe Eight Winds entwine the emerald palace,\nThe clustered mists suddenly disperse.\nThe numinous youth hurls flowing gold,\nA spark of fire ignites the departing case.\nThe Three Primes bow in dance,\nThe Purple Emperor waves his sleeves in praise.\nBright and clear, the radiance of the fan’s light,\nResplendent, the Long Star’s brilliance.\nMy chariot soars, its gleaming blades aloft,\nAs I glance down, moved to sorrow.\nI pity the earthbound immortals—\nWhy do they dwell in the forest streams?\n\n**Song of the Numinous Phoenix:**\nDim, dim the numinous phoenix,\nEndlessly it returns afar.\nLong, long my yearning,\nForever at odds with my wishes.\nThrough ten thousand kalpas, no appointed time—\nWhen will it come in flight?\n\nThen the phoenix slain by the king\nBurst forth in lush growth,\nEmbracing its daughter, they flew as one,\nStraight into the clouds they departed.\n\n**Zhang Liying the Female Immortal’s Stone Drum Song:**\nStone drum, O stone drum,\nHow sorrowful the world below!\nSince I came to behold it,\nThe lives of mortals are truly bitter.\nAlas for the affairs of the world,\nEndless my thoughts.\nMy thoughts cannot be humiliated,\nNor the king’s might seize them.\nMy will holds the luan and the phoenix,\nI sing and dance for myself,\nSoaring through the clouds, traversing the Han,\nFar beyond the dust and snares.\nO children of the world,\nWhat can you do to me?\nA brief meeting, then parting as fate decrees—\nFather, O mother,\nHow deeply you grieve my heart!\n\n**Song of the Han Child’s Rhyme:**\nDonning a blue skirt, she enters the Heavenly Gate,\nBows to the Golden Mother, pays homage to the Wood Lord.\nNone of the people of the time knew her,\nOnly Zhang Zifang recognized her and went to bow.\nHe said: “This is the Jade Youth of the Eastern King Father.”\nIt speaks of immortals who attain the Dao and ascend to heaven,\nWho must bow to the Golden Mother and pay homage to the Wood Lord.\nNone but those who ascend through emptiness and attain perfection\nKnow the ford to this realm.\n\n**E Lühua’s Poem Presented to Yang Quan:**\nThe divine peaks rise to cleave the clouds,\nSoaring peaks stand a thousand fathoms tall.\nThe numinous valley lies desolate and vast,\nThe jasper grove lush and dense.\nYang, your beauty and elegance shine,\nIn youth your pure voice flows.\nYou nest your heart in Zhuangzi and Hui Shi’s ford,\nTranscending form in Wei’s forest.\nYour radiance gleams within the vermilion gates,\nWithin and without, you surpass the common heart.",

mirror is hard to find?\nIt lies within the square inch of the heart.\nBeyond the cage, we yearn to soar,\nboth to become mountain recluses.\nLet not your wings rise too high on the void,\nlest the startled wind sweep you away.\nTransformation depends on man,\nyet the fenced sheep cannot be compared.\nWhat I seek is no fleeting bloom—\nin you, my hope endures till life’s close.\n\n**Poem

stand lofty and grand.\nWithin the vermilion chambers of jade portals,\nsupreme virtue shines like crimson mist.\nBelow, I rinse my mouth with the sacred flask’s stream;\nabove, I pluck the azure *bi* blossoms.\nI bathe my feet in the Jade Celestial Pool,\nand strike the stalks by the River of the Herd Boy.\nThen I urge my cloud-chariot on,\nletting the dragon reins fall to the dark slope.\nI shake my robes at the dust’s edge,\nlifting my skirts to tread the turbid waves.\nWould that we bind ourselves to mountain and marsh,\nhard and soft in perfect harmony.\nHand in hand within the realm of dual purity,\nthe perfected Way strays not from truth.\nIn the Purple Tenuity, we meet in wise counsel,\nour songs and offerings bring boundless fortune.\n\n**Second Poem:**\nSwiftly I depart from the Western Flower,\nbetween the waiting and the unwaiting.\nNow I glance at the Five Peaks,\nnow I bathe in the Celestial River’s ford.\nI release the wheel to seek the empty boat—\nwherever I go, all is bound in tenderness.\nA mustard seed holds ten thousand acres,\nwithin it, Mount Kunlun stands.\nGreat and small are not truly different,\nnear and far share the same cause.\nThey come as those who wait,\nI come as one who needs no waiting.\n\n**Poem by the Lady of the Central Watchpost, Wang:**\nDragon banners dance in the Great Void,\nflying wheels trace the Five Peaks’ slopes.\nWherever I go,

deeply, observing the crowd’s wisdom,\nswiftly draining the four directions’ bounds.\nUnknowing of how it came to be,\ntruly, this is no journey of waiting.\nAll encounters bring joy,\nno meeting brings sorrow.\nOur forms drift in the dark void,\ntwo gatherings naturally paired.\n\n**Third Poem:**\nFlying wheels ascend the morning terrace,\nreining in the dark mound’s edge.\nHand in hand with
