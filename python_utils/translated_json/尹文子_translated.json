  "full_translation": "**Preface to the *Yinwenzi* from the *Qinding Siku Quanshu Zongmu Tiyao***\n\nThe *Way Above* and the *Way Below*—this edition, collated by the Qian family of Jinshan, includes textual notes and appended lost passages.\n\n**Qinding Siku Quanshu Zongmu Tiyao**\n*Yinwenzi*, one juan. Composed by Yin Wen of the Zhou.\n\nA preface by Zhongchang of Shanyang, dated the end of the Huangchu era of Wei, states that the text was arranged and finalized into upper and lower chapters. The *Wenxian Tongkao* records it as two juan, while this edition also titles them *The Way Above* and *The Way Below*, consistent with the preface, though compiled into a single juan—likely a later consolidation.\n\nIn the *Zhuangzi*’s \"Below in the World\" chapter, Yin Wen is mentioned alongside Tian Pian. Yan Shigu’s commentary on the *Hanshu* identifies him as a contemporary of King Xuan of Qi. This is corroborated by Liu Xiang’s *Shuo Yuan*, which records his dialogues with King Xuan. However, the *Lüshi Chunqiu* also documents his exchanges with King Min, suggesting he may have lived from the reign of King Xuan into that of King Min.\n\nThe work belongs to the School of Names, its central theme expounding the principles of governance. It advocates self-cultivation through emptiness and stillness while meticulously examining the realities of all affairs and things. Thus, its discourse traverses the boundaries of the Huang-Lao and Shen-Han traditions. Zhou’s marginal notes aptly observe its progression from the Dao to names, and from names to laws—a true reflection of its essence.\n\nChao Gongwu’s *Dushu Zhi* mistakenly claims it recites the methods of Confucius, a statement rightly ridiculed by Gao Sisun in his *Weilüe*. Yet Gao’s own critique, measuring it by Confucian principles and deeming it confused, is equally unjust. Amidst the clamor of a hundred schools and the parallel existence of nine streams, each venerates its own insights and practices its own knowledge. From Laozi and Zhuangzi onward, each established its own distinct doctrine. The reader of such texts should value their breadth, eloquence, and unbridled expressiveness—how could one confine them to a single mold?\n\nThe Xibo mentioned in the preface is likely Miao Xi’s courtesy name. The identity of the \"Zhongchang of Shanyang\" remains uncertain. Li Xianchen suggests it was Zhongchang Tong, but Tong died at the end of the Jian’an era, which does not align with the \"end of Huangchu.\" Chao Gongwu’s subsequent doubt about historical errors is an overreach.\n\n**Original Preface**\n\nThe *Yinwenzi* likely originated from the Yin clan of the Zhou. During the reign of King Xuan of Qi, its author resided at Jixia, studying alongside Song Jian, Peng Meng, and Tian Pian under Gongsun Long. Gongsun Long praised him and composed a single work, which synthesized much wisdom. Zhuangzi said: \"Unburdened by things, uncompromising toward others, unmoved by the crowd, desiring the world’s peace to preserve the lives of the people—providing for oneself and others until sufficiency is reached, and thus purifying the heart. Though insulted, one feels no disgrace—such is his Dao.\" Liu Xiang also traced its teachings to the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, broadly classifying it as a School of Names. Recent claims that it is slanderous are unfounded.\n\nAt the end of the Huangchu era, I first arrived in the capital. Miao Xibo showed me this text, and though I suspected he had studied it extensively, it contained many omissions and errors. I tentatively arranged and edited it into two scrolls, the *Upper* and *Lower*, though I could not exhaustively examine its details.\n\n**Composed by the Zhongchang of Shanyang**\n\n**The Great Dao (Upper Scroll)**\n\nThe Great Dao is formless. Only when it takes shape in vessels does it acquire names. Names are what rectify forms. When forms are rectified by names, names must not err. Thus, Confucius said: \"It is necessary to rectify names.\" If names are not rectified, speech will not be proper.\n\nThe Great Dao is not named, yet all things must be named. Born from the unnamable, the myriad forms naturally attain their squares and circles. Names arise from squares and circles, and thus all names find their proper designation.\n\nWhen the Great Dao governs, the schools of Names, Laws, Confucians, and Mohists naturally fade. Yet those who govern by Names, Laws, Confucians, or Mohists cannot depart from the Dao. Laozi said: \"The Dao is the mystery of the ten thousand things, the treasure of the good, and what the ungood treasure.\" Those who govern by the Dao are called good; those who rely on Names, Laws, Confucians, or Mohists are called ungood. The distinction between good and ungood grows daily clearer, discernible without close examination.\n\nWhen the Dao is insufficient to govern, laws are employed. When laws are insufficient, techniques are used. When techniques are insufficient, power is wielded. When power is insufficient, authority is asserted. The use of authority reverts to power; the use of power reverts to techniques; the use of techniques reverts to laws; the use of laws reverts to the Dao. When the Dao is employed, governance is effortless and self-sustaining. Thus, when exhausted, one seeks an end; when the end is reached, one returns to the beginning. Beginning and end follow one another endlessly.\n\nWhat has form must have a name, but what has a name does not necessarily have form. A form without a name does not necessarily lose its true square, circle, white, or black. Yet names cannot be left unexamined, for names correct deviations. Thus, names may check forms, forms may fix names, names may fix affairs, and affairs may verify names. By examining their underlying principles, the relationship between forms, names, affairs, and things reveals no hidden truths.\n\nNames have three categories, and laws have four manifestations.\n**Names:**\n1. Names that designate things—square, circle, white, black.\n2. Names of praise and blame—good, evil, noble, base.\n3. Names of analogy and reference—worthy, foolish, love, hatred.\n\n**Laws:**\n1. Unchanging laws—ruler and minister, superior and inferior.\n2. Laws that harmonize customs—competence and ineptitude, similarity and difference.\n3. Laws for governing the masses—rewards, punishments, penalties.\n4. Laws of standardization—measures, weights, scales, and balances.\n\n**Techniques** are what the ruler employs in secret; the masses must not rashly pry into them. **Authority** is the sharp instrument for enacting laws; the masses must not rashly wield it. If the ruler possesses techniques yet allows the masses to glimpse their mysteries, or holds authority yet permits the masses to usurp its weight, the crux lies in first rectifying names and divisions to prevent encroachment. Only then can techniques remain hidden and authority remain concentrated.\n\nNames name forms, and forms respond to names. Yet forms do not rectify names, nor do names rectify forms. Thus, names and forms are distinctly separate—they cannot be confused, nor can they be without one another. Without names, the Great Dao is unnamable; with names, names rectify forms.\n\nNow, the ten thousand things exist, and without names to rectify them, chaos ensues. The myriad names are arrayed, and without forms to correspond, discord arises. Thus, forms and names cannot remain unrectified.\n\nGood names designate goodness; evil names designate evil. Therefore, goodness has good names, and evil has evil names. The sage, the worthy, the benevolent, and the wise are designated by good names. The obstinate, the perverse, the cruel, and the foolish are designated by evil names.\n\nYet even when using the names of sages, worthies, benevolence, and wisdom to seek their true essence, one may not fully attain it. Likewise, using the names of the obstinate, perverse, cruel, and foolish to seek their true essence may not fully capture it. If goodness and evil are clearly distinguished, even if one cannot exhaust the reality of things, one need not fear deviation. Thus, it is said: names cannot be left unexamined.\n\nNames and designations distinguish this from that and verify the real from the false. From ancient times to the present, none have succeeded by using the latter and failed by using the former. Failure stems from the confusion of names and divisions; success stems from their careful examination.\n\nNow, to draw near the worthy and distance the unworthy, to reward the good and punish the evil—the names of worthy and unworthy, good and evil belong to them, while the designations of nearness and distance, reward and punishment belong to me. Between me and them, there is yet another name: the examination of names.\n\nTo name the worthy and unworthy as nearness and distance, to name good and evil as reward and punishment, and to conflate these designations without distinction—this is the confusion of names. Thus, it is said: names and designations cannot be left unexamined.\n\nAs the saying goes...\n\n\"Good ox.\" It is also said: \"This cannot be left unexamined.\" \"Good\" is a general designation for things, while \"ox\" is a fixed form of a thing. To let the general designation follow the fixed form is inexhaustible. Suppose one speaks again of \"good horse\"—then it is again connected to horse. Thus, \"good\" extends without limit. Suppose one speaks again of \"good person\"—then it pertains to person. Thus, \"good\" is not person, and person is not \"good.\" The names \"good ox,\" \"good horse,\" and \"good person\" are naturally distinct. Therefore, it is said: the divisions of names cannot be confused.\n\nThe five colors, five sounds, five odors, and five flavors—these four categories naturally exist in heaven and earth, not intended for human use. Yet humans must use them, and throughout their lives, each has preferences and aversions without discerning their names and divisions. The names should belong to them, while the divisions should belong to me. I love white and detest black, favor the *shang* note and reject the *zhi*, prefer rank odors and dislike burnt ones, crave sweetness and recoil from bitterness. White and black, *shang* and *zhi*, rank and burnt, sweet and bitter—these are their names.\n\nLove and hatred, preference and aversion, fondness and rejection—these are my divisions. When these names and divisions are fixed, all affairs remain orderly.\n\nThus, people measure length with standards, determine quantity with measures, balance weight with scales, harmonize pitch with tuning, verify truth with names, settle order and chaos with laws, resolve confusion with simplicity, and overcome peril with ease. In all matters, they return to the One; in all measures, they conform to the Law.\n\nReturning to the One is the utmost simplicity; conforming to the Law is the ultimate ease. In this way, even the stubborn, the deaf, and the blind can attain the discernment of the wise and the clarity of the perceptive—united in governance.\n\nThe myriad affairs of the world cannot all be mastered. To demand such mastery from one person is to burden even the worthy and the sage. Suppose one person could possess all the world’s skills—yet in the appropriateness of left and right, front and back, far and near, slow and swift, there would still be incompleteness. Where there is incompleteness, governance is lacking. Perfect governance without deficiency lies in great and small, many and few, each fitting its division: farmer and merchant, artisan and official do not exchange their trades; the veteran farmer, the seasoned merchant, the skilled artisan, and the experienced scholar all remain in their places. Then what is left for the ruler to do?\n\nThus, the noble person does not speak of principles that, though sound, do not benefit governance. The noble person does not act on abilities that, though competent, do not advance affairs. The noble person does not delight in speech, but when it benefits governance, cannot refrain from speaking. The noble person does not delight in action, but when it advances affairs, cannot refrain from acting. Therefore, what they speak does not extend beyond names, laws, authority, and strategy; what they do does not extend beyond farming, warfare, and military formations—attending to essential duties and nothing more.\n\nThe enlightened ruler does not pursue principles beyond governance. The petty person must speak of abilities beyond affairs. The petty person knows their words harm governance yet cannot refrain from speaking; they know their actions harm affairs yet cannot refrain from acting. Thus, what they speak culminates in the debates of Confucians and Mohists over right and wrong; what they do culminates in obstinate, deceptive, biased, and defiant conduct—seeking reputation and nothing more. Therefore, the enlightened ruler punishes them.\n\nAn ancient saying goes: \"Ignorance does no harm to the noble person; knowledge does no good to the petty person. The craftsman’s inability does no harm to skill; the noble person’s ignorance does no harm to governance.\" This is true.\n\nTo do good in a way that others cannot follow is solitary virtue. To craft skill in a way that others cannot follow is solitary skill. These do not exhaust the principles of goodness and skill. To do good alongside the multitude and to craft skill alongside others—this is the highest goodness, the highest skill.\n\nWhat is prized in the sage’s governance is not their solitary rule but their ability to govern together with the people. What is prized in the skill of the master craftsman is not their solitary skill but their ability to craft together with others.\n\nYet people today desire to be uniquely worthy in conduct, uniquely capable in affairs, surpassing in eloquence, and peerless in courage. Solitary worth cannot transform the world; solitary ability cannot attend to all duties. Eloquence that surpasses the crowd cannot be explained door-to-door; courage that outstrips the multitude cannot be deployed in battle. These four traits are the source of chaos.\n\nThus, the sage employs the Way to level peril, establishes laws to regulate disparities, ensuring the worthy and the foolish do not abandon one another, the capable and the base do not neglect one another. When the capable and the base do not neglect one another, their contributions are equal; when the worthy and the foolish do not abandon one another, their considerations are alike. This is the art of perfect governance.\n\nWhen names are fixed, things do not compete; when divisions are clear, self-interest does not prevail. Things do not compete not because they lack intent, but because names are fixed—thus they have no place to direct their intent. Self-interest does not prevail not because they lack desire, but because divisions are clear—thus they have no place to direct their desire. Though intent and desire exist in everyone, they can be made to resemble the absence of intent and desire through proper regulation.\n\nTian Pian said: \"The scholars of the world...\"\n\nNone are willing to remain in their own courtyards, serving their wives and children—all must wander to the courts of the feudal lords, drawn by profit. Yet though they wander to the courts of the feudal lords, all aspire to become ministers and grandees, none presuming to rival the lords themselves—this is the limit set by names.\n\nPeng Meng said: \"When pheasants and hares roam the wilds, the masses pursue them, for their division is not yet fixed. But when chickens and pigs fill the market, none covet them, for their division is settled. When things are in excess, benevolence and wisdom are subdued; when divisions are fixed, the greedy and base do not contend. A wheel turns not because it can turn, but because it cannot but turn. A square block rests not because it can rest, but because it cannot but rest. Thus, by following the wheel’s natural turning, one prevents it from stopping; by following the block’s natural resting, one prevents it from rolling. Why trouble over things losing their proper place? Therefore, by relying on the capable’s usefulness, one ensures they cannot but be used; by relying on the incapable’s uselessness, one ensures they cannot be used. Whether used or unused, neither is of my own doing—it is by following what they themselves can or cannot do that their proper use is achieved. How then could one fear the disorder of things?\n\nAll things cannot themselves be capable, nor can they themselves know. The wise are not wise because they can be wise, nor are the foolish foolish because they can be foolish. The lovely are not lovely because they can be lovely, nor are the ugly ugly because they can be ugly. If they cannot themselves be capable or know, then what is there to value in wisdom or beauty? What is there to despise in foolishness or ugliness? Thus, the wise cannot boast over the foolish, nor can the lovely mock the ugly—this is the Way of attaining harmony.\n\nWhen the Dao prevails in the world, the poor and lowly do not resent, the rich and noble do not arrogate, the foolish and weak do not cower, and the wise and brave do not oppress—all is settled by their proper place. When the law prevails in the world, the poor and lowly dare not resent the rich and noble, the rich and noble dare not oppress the poor and lowly, the foolish and weak dare not aspire to the wise and brave, and the wise and brave dare not despise the foolish and weak—this is where the law falls short of the Dao.\n\nWhat the world values, when all value it together, is called custom. What the world uses, when all use it together, is called convention. If one goes against others, custom will not align; if one offends the multitude, custom will cast one out. Thus, though minds differ, conduct appears uniform; though preferences vary, resources and uses must align—this is how custom levels all. This is how convention adorns all. Therefore, what is leveled must be approached with care, and what is adorned must be chosen with discernment.\n\nOf old, Duke Huan of Qi favored purple robes, and throughout his realm none sold garments of other hues. King Zhuang of Chu loved slender waists, and all in his land bore the pallor of hunger. Such is how those above lead those below.\"\n\nThus arises the origin of order and chaos.\n\nWhen custom turns pernicious, governance must be established to correct it. When convention overflows its bounds, regulations must be set to restrain it. Those ensnared by custom and adorned by convention cannot partake in governance.\n\nOf old, the state of Jin suffered from extravagance, and Duke Wen corrected it with frugality. He wore no layered silks and ate no meat but the simplest fare. In no time, all in his realm donned coarse cloth and ate plain grain. King Goujian of Yue, plotting vengeance against Wu, sought to make his people brave. When he encountered an angry toad upon the road, he bowed to it in respect. Within a few years, none in his land, young or old, would flinch from fire or boiling water in the face of battle.\n\nSuch is the palpable difficulty of those above. The sage-kings, knowing how readily human nature sways, composed music to harmonize it and instituted rites to moderate it. Those below were thus denied the use of their private inclinations, and rites and music alone prevailed. When rites and music alone prevail, private desires wane and fade. When private desires wane and fade, encountering the worthy and encountering the foolish become one and the same. If encountering the worthy brings order and encountering the foolish brings chaos, then order and chaos hinge upon worthiness and foolishness, not upon rites and music. Thus, the art of the sages perishes with the sage-rulers, and the laws of well-ordered ages fall into disuse with the passing of generations. Chaos then abounds while order dwindles. When chaos abounds and order dwindles, the worthy gain no esteem, and the foolish suffer no disgrace.\n\nThose who occupy high rank, though base and benighted, find no estrangement from others. Closeness and distance depend upon power and profit, not upon baseness or worthiness, benevolence or wisdom. I dare not claim this as the principle of Heaven, but rather as the natural tendency of earthly conditions. Now, between Heaven and Earth, the base are indeed many, and the benevolent and worthy are indeed few. The impulse to seek profit is strong in the base, while the sense of integrity and shame is more pronounced in the benevolent and worthy. If one summons the benevolent and worthy with rites and justice, those obtained will be but one in ten thousand. If one summons the base with fame and profit, the base will be found everywhere. Thus it is said: rites and justice perfect the noble person, though the noble person does not necessarily require rites and justice. Fame and profit govern the petty person, and the petty person cannot do without fame and profit.\n\nRewards and punishments are the sovereign’s affairs. Upholding duties and demonstrating competence are the minister’s tasks. The sovereign assesses merit and demotes or promotes accordingly, hence the use of rewards and punishments. Ministers each attend diligently to their duties, hence the fulfillment of their roles. The sovereign must not encroach upon the minister’s tasks, nor the minister upon the sovereign’s affairs. When above and below do not encroach upon one another, this is called \"proper naming.\" When names are proper, the law follows smoothly.\n\nTo engage with the myriad things so that each is distinct, to govern all within the seas so that none is confused, to suffer insult without shame, to receive praise without pride, to suppress violence and still the blades of war—these are the virtues of a humane ruler, one who may be called a true sovereign.\n\nTo uphold one’s duties without disorder, to be prudent in one’s tasks without partiality, to maintain a single mind whether sated or hungry, to weigh praise and blame with equal consideration, to neither forget rewards nor resent punishments—these are the disciplines of one below, one who may be called a true minister.\n\nIn this world, some gain substance through reputation, while others lose substance through reputation. King Xuan of Qi was fond of archery and delighted in others saying he could draw a strong bow. In truth, his strength did not exceed three *dan*. To demonstrate this to his courtiers, they all drew the bow to test it, stopping at the halfway point, and declared, \"None but Your Majesty could draw such a bow—it must be no less than nine *dan*!\" King Xuan was pleased. Yet in reality, his strength did not exceed three *dan*, and he lived out his days believing it to be nine. Three *dan* was the reality; nine *dan* was the name. King Xuan rejoiced in the name and lost the reality.\n\nIn Qi, there was a man called Huang Gong who was fond of humility. He had two daughters, both of peerless beauty. Because of their loveliness, he constantly belittled and disparaged them, calling them ugly. The reputation of their ugliness spread far and wide, and though they passed marriageable age, no one in the state sought their hand. A widower from Wei, taking a chance, married one, and she proved to be of peerless beauty. Only then did people say, \"Huang Gong was fond of humility, so he slandered his daughters as unlovely.\" Thereupon, suitors vied to offer betrothal gifts, and the other daughter, too, was found to be of peerless beauty. Peerless beauty was the reality; ugliness was the name. Here, by defying the name, one gained the reality.\n\nA man from Chu was carrying mountain pheasants when a traveler asked what bird it was. The pheasant-carrier deceived him, saying, \"It is a phoenix.\" The traveler said, \"I have heard of the phoenix, and now I have seen one with my own eyes. Are you selling it?\" The man replied...\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"for ten gold pieces.\" The traveler refused. \"Then let me double the price,\" the man said, and the traveler agreed. Intending to present it to the King of Chu, he carried it away, but the bird died overnight. The traveler did not regret the gold spent; he only lamented that he could not offer it to the King of Chu. The story spread throughout the state, and all believed it to be a true phoenix. Its value soared, and the traveler wished to present it to the king. When the King of Chu heard of this, he was moved by the man’s desire to offer it to him. He summoned the traveler and bestowed upon him a reward ten times greater than the gold paid for the bird.\n\nIn Wei, a farmer plowing in the wilds unearthed a jade disk measuring a foot in diameter. Not recognizing it as jade, he showed it to his neighbor. The neighbor, secretly coveting it, said, \"It is a strange stone. Keep it, and it will bring no benefit to your household. Better to throw it away.\" Though the farmer doubted, he still took it home and placed it beneath the eaves. That night, the jade glowed, illuminating the entire room. The farmer, declaring his household greatly alarmed, again consulted his neighbor. \"This is an omen of misfortune,\" the neighbor said. \"Cast it away at once, and the calamity may be averted.\" The farmer promptly discarded it in a distant field. Before long, the neighbor stole it and presented it to the King of Wei. The king summoned a jade artisan to examine it. Upon seeing it, the artisan bowed twice and stood, offering his congratulations: \"Your Majesty has obtained a treasure of the world. Your servant has never beheld its equal.\" The king asked its value. The artisan replied, \"This jade is beyond price. A city of five districts would scarcely suffice to exchange for a single glimpse.\" The King of Wei immediately bestowed a thousand gold pieces upon the one who presented the jade and granted him a perpetual stipend as an Upper Grandee, sufficient to sustain him for ten thousand *li* across the realm.\n\nAll things bear right and wrong—this I dare not falsify. What is right remains ever right; what is wrong remains ever wrong—this I hold as truth. Yet though right is ever right, there are times it goes unused; though wrong is ever wrong, there are times it must be done. Thus, employing right may bring loss, while acting wrong may bring gain. The principles of right and wrong differ, and their rise and fall alternate, turning to serve my ends—where then do right and wrong reside?\n\nObserve the achievements of Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu: some followed the Way, some defied it, yet seizing the moment brought prosperity. The downfalls of Jie, Zhou, You, and Li: some were right, some were wrong, yet missing the moment brought ruin. The hegemons of the Five Lords followed the same pattern.\n\nWhen Duke Xiang of Song fought the Chu at Hong, his minister Zimu said, \"The Chu outnumber us—let us strike before they finish crossing the river.\" The duke replied, \"No. I have heard one does not attack an unformed battle line. Though I am the remnant of a ruined state, I dare not do this.\" The battle was lost, and the Chu captured the duke.\n\nWhen the people of Qi murdered Duke Xiang and enthroned Duke Wuzhi, Shaohu and Yiwu escorted Prince Jiu in flight to Lu, while Bao Shuya escorted Prince Xiaobo to Ju. Soon after, Wuzhi was killed, and the two princes vied for the throne. Jiu was the rightful heir, but Xiaobo arrived first, so the Qi people enthroned him. Later, he forced the Lu to kill Jiu. Shaohu died for him, while Yiwu was summoned to serve as minister. When Duke Wen of Jin was slandered by Li Ji, he went into exile for nineteen years. After Duke Hui died, he bribed Qin to regain his state, killed Prince Huai, and usurped the throne.\n\nOne ruler acted rightly yet was not spared capture; two rulers acted wrongly yet achieved hegemony. If one is right while the world deems one wrong, one may not recognize one’s own rightness. If one is wrong while the world deems one right, one may not recognize one’s own wrong. Thus, right and wrong follow the market of the crowd to become correct—not something one can decide alone. To defy the crowd is wrong; to follow it is right.\n\nTherefore, when a ruler wields power and seizes opportunity, standing where all deem right, none dare condemn him. At rest, all honor him; in motion, all follow him; in speech, all trust him; in action, all emulate him. This is how he resides above all and governs those below.\n\nA state falls into chaos through three things: famine, when the people scatter—without food to gather them, chaos ensues; lack of law, when governance has no standard, chaos ensues; or laws exist but are not enforced, chaos ensues. With food to gather the people and laws that are enforced, a state cannot fail to be well-ordered.\n\nThe Great Dao declines, and benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music, names, laws, punishments, and rewards arise—these eight are the arts by which the Five Emperors and Three Kings governed the world. Thus, benevolence guides them, righteousness makes them fitting, ritual enacts them, music harmonizes them, names rectify them, laws unify them, punishments awe them, and rewards encourage them.\n\nYet benevolence, though it broadly bestows upon all, also breeds partiality; righteousness, though it establishes integrity, also fosters hypocrisy; ritual, though it enacts reverence, also engenders laziness and disdain; music, though it harmonizes the emotions, also gives rise to licentiousness; names, though they rectify hierarchy, also breed arrogance and usurpation; laws, though they unify differences, also disrupt proper order; punishments, though they awe the disobedient, also breed oppression and violence; rewards, though they encourage loyalty and ability, also breed vulgar competition.\n\nThese eight arts are never hidden from people and always exist in the world. They did not first appear in the eras of Yao and Tang, nor did they vanish in the courts of Jie and Zhou. When used rightly, the world is well-ordered; when misused, the world falls into chaos. Beyond these, though one may encompass heaven and earth and embrace all things, such matters lie outside the Way of governance—beings do not feed upon them, and the sage sets them aside without comment.\n\nAll states exhibit six signs in their rise and fall: declining states, doomed states, flourishing states, strong states, well-ordered states, and chaotic states. The so-called chaotic and doomed states are not merely those of cruelty and violence; the so-called strong and well-ordered states are not merely those of might and virtue.\n\nA ruler who is aged, has many concubines, few descendants, and estranged clansmen—this is a declining state. A ruler who favors ministers, whose ministers adore him, where public law is abandoned and private desires prevail—this is a chaotic state. A state that is poor and small, where families are rich and great, the ruler’s authority is light, and ministers’ power is heavy—this is a doomed state. These three signs do not require cruelty or violence to weaken a state. Though it may appear to survive, I must call it doomed. When within there is no favored concubine, and without there is no favored attendant...\n\nBranches and descendants flourish, seniority and juniority remain in order—this is a prosperous state. Farming and sericulture follow the seasons, granaries are full, weapons are sharp and sturdy, borders are well-maintained—this is a strong state. The superior cannot overpower the inferior, the inferior cannot offend the superior; when neither overpowers nor offends the other, prohibitions are enforced, and no one acts for private gain. Though the state may pass through peril or ease, it cannot be invaded—this is a well-ordered state. These three signs do not require might or virtue to strengthen a state. Though it may appear weak, I must call it enduring.\n\nWhen a sagely ruler rises to power, there must be those he executes first. Those executed first are not thieves, nor are they villains. These two evils are but great harms of the moment, not the root of disordered governance. The root of disordered governance lies in inferiors encroaching upon the superior’s authority, ministers employing the ruler’s methods, hearts unafraid of the prohibitions of the time, and conduct that transgresses the laws of the age—this is the Way of great chaos.\n\nWhen Confucius assumed the role of minister in Lu, he executed Shaozheng Mao within seven days. His disciples approached and asked, “Shaozheng Mao was a renowned figure in Lu. Now that you govern, you execute him first—might this be a mistake?” Confucius replied, “Sit, and I will tell you the reason.”\n\nThere are five evil traits in a person, not including theft or illicit conduct. The first is a mind that is perceptive yet treacherous. The second is conduct that is depraved yet unyielding. The third is speech that is false yet persuasive. The fourth is a memory that is retentive yet wide-ranging. The fifth is compliance with wrongdoing yet glossed with eloquence. Should any one of these five be found in a person, they cannot escape the punishment of the noble ruler. Shaozheng Mao possessed all five. Thus, his dwelling was sufficient to gather disciples and form factions; his speech was sufficient to adorn falsehoods and dazzle the multitude; his retentive memory was sufficient to overturn rightness and stand alone. Such is the hero of petty men—he cannot be left unpunished.\n\nTherefore, Tang executed Yin Xie, King Wen executed Pan Zheng, the Grand Duke executed Hua Shi, Guan Zhong executed Fu Li Yi, and Zichan executed Deng Xi and Shi Fu. These six men, though living in different ages, shared the same perverse intent—they could not be left unpunished.\n\nThe *Odes* says:\n*\"My anxious heart is filled with sorrow,\nResentful of the throng of petty men.\nWhen petty men form factions,\nThis is truly cause for fear.\"*\n\nIt is said: \"Cunning eloquence can delude even ghosts and spirits.\"\nOne asks: \"Ghosts and spirits are wise and upright—who says they can be deluded?\"\nIt is said: \"Ghosts and spirits indeed cannot be deluded, yet the art of cunning eloquence is so subtle that nothing fails to penetrate. Though cunning eloquence may not delude ghosts and spirits, it clearly deludes men. It probes the hearts of others, gauges their desires, complies with their preferences without daring to oppose, and leads them into depravity while seeking their favor.\n\nPeople delight in hearing their own virtues—such eloquence excels at extolling them. They detest hearing their own faults—such eloquence excels at concealing them. It seizes upon the slightest hint in their expressions, anticipates their words and actions, and thus speaks.\"\n\n\"To hate the usurpation of vermilion by purple, to detest the eloquent tongue that overturns states and households—such words are fearful indeed, yet none awaken to them throughout their lives. Peril and ruin follow on their heels.\n\nLaozi said: 'Govern the state with upright governance, employ the army with extraordinary tactics, and win the world through non-action.' Governance refers to names and laws. To govern the state with names and laws is to leave nothing in disorder. Extraordinary tactics refer to power and strategy. To employ the army with power and strategy is to leave nothing unconquered. If one can wield names, laws, power, and strategy to restrain and suppress the impulses of cruelty and violence, then one remains without trouble. Being without trouble, one gains the world.\n\nThus, when governance fails, rely on law; when law fails, rely on arms—all to seek non-action, not to seize strength. For if one seizes strength, even the yielding may turn and subdue it.\n\nLaozi said: 'When the people do not fear death, how can they be frightened by it?' When the people do not fear death, it is because punishments are excessive. When punishments are excessive, the people no longer rely on life. With no reliance on life, they regard the ruler’s might as nothing. When punishments are measured, the people fear death. Fearing death arises from the joy of life. Knowing the joy of life, one may then frighten them with death. This is what the ruler should grasp, and what ministers should carefully heed.\"\n\nField Master was reading a book and said, \"In the time of Yao, there was great peace.\"\n\nSongzi replied, \"Did the governance of the sage bring this about?\"\n\nPeng Meng, who was at his side, stepped forward out of turn and answered, \"It was the governance of sagely laws that brought this about, not the governance of the sage.\"\n\nSongzi asked, \"What is the difference between the sage and sagely laws?\"\n\nPeng Meng said, \"Your confusion of names is severe. The sage acts from himself. Sagely laws proceed from principle. Principle emerges from the self, yet the self is not principle. The self can bring forth principle, yet principle is not the self. Thus, the governance of the sage is solitary governance. The governance of sagely laws leaves nothing ungoverned. This is the benefit to the myriad things, and only the sage can encompass it.\"\n\nSongzi remained perplexed and sought clarification from Field Master. Field Master said, \"Peng Meng’s words are correct.\"\n\nIn Zhuang Village, there was an old man whose eldest son was named *Thief* and whose youngest son was named *Strike*. One day, *Thief* went out, and his father followed behind, calling after him, \"*Thief! Thief!*\" An officer heard this and bound the son. The father called out *Strike* to explain to the officer, but in his haste, his words became tangled, and he could only say, \"*Strike! Strike!*\" The officer then struck the son, nearly killing him.\n\nIn Kangqu, there was an elder whose servant was named *Good-at-Fighting* and whose dog was named *Good-at-Biting*. For three years, no guests passed through his gate. The elder found this strange and inquired about it.\n\nThe elder then truthfully explained the matter. Thereupon, he changed the names. Guests came and went once more.\n\nThe people of Zheng called uncut jade *pu*. The people of Zhou called an unsalted rat *pu*. A man of Zhou, carrying *pu*, said to a merchant of Zheng, \"Would you like to buy *pu*?\" The merchant of Zheng replied, \"I would.\" The man of Zhou brought out his *pu* for inspection—it was a rat. The merchant of Zheng declined and did not take it.\n\nA father’s commands to his son may be of two kinds: those that must be obeyed and those that cannot be obeyed. To dismiss a favored wife or sell a beloved concubine—these are commands that must be obeyed. Thus, he might say, \"You must harbor no resentment. You must entertain no longing.\" These are commands that cannot be obeyed.\n\nTherefore, those who hold authority over others must be cautious in what they command. Generally, when people are wealthy, they do not covet rank or salary; when they are poor, they do not fear punishment. Those who do not covet rank or salary are self-sufficient. Those who do not fear punishment do not rely on their own preservation. These two conditions are of great concern to the state, yet the means to guard against them are unknown. Thus, commands go unheeded, and prohibitions are not observed. If commands go unheeded and prohibitions are not observed, there can be no governance. Without governance, the ruler merely occupies his position in vain, a nominal lord over his people. Chaos and ruin will swiftly follow.\n\nIf wealth were only attainable through rank and salary, people would surely strive with all their might for their lord. If poverty were only the result of punishment, people would universally fear transgression and follow goodness. Thus, the ancients who governed the state did not allow the people to become rich or poor on their own. When wealth and poverty both depend on the ruler, the ruler holds exclusive control, and the people know to whom they owe their allegiance.\n\nThe poor resent others; the lowly resent their circumstances. Yet none resent themselves—this is the great tendency of human nature. However, one cannot dismiss this as merely the great tendency of human nature and wholly condemn it. There are also those deserving of compassion, which must not be overlooked.\n\nNow, if two men are equal in ability and strength, yet one grows rich while the other remains poor, to bear no resentment would be admirable. Even if resentment arises, it is not without justification. If two men are equal in talent and wisdom, yet one is honored while the other is debased, to bear no resentment would be admirable. Even if resentment arises, it is not without justification. The fault lies in failing to recognize the difference in seizing opportunities and leveraging circumstances, and though their intelligence and ability may be the same, this is the error of those who do not comprehend. Even a gentleman’s frustration in such cases is a righteous anger.\n\nWhen people are poor, they resent others; when they are rich, they become arrogant. Those who resent others do so because they suffer from not receiving bounty, arising from a state of distress they cannot endure—this may be forgiven. But those who are arrogant incur no suffering, yet arrogantly belittle others without cause. This is a flaw that could easily be controlled yet is not—it cannot be forgiven.\n\nThe common people, upon seeing the poor and lowly, treat them with disdain and distance. Upon seeing the rich and noble, they show respect and draw near. If the poor and lowly make requests of them, keeping their distance is acceptable, for it does not necessarily harm them. Yet they must distance themselves, for the poor and lowly possess nothing of value. If the rich and noble bestow favors upon them, drawing near is acceptable, for it does not necessarily benefit them. Yet they must draw near, or the rich and noble will not dare to approach them. These three conditions stand independently, without any basis for closeness or distance. Human nature ultimately cannot help but shift its concerns with poverty and lowliness, wealth and nobility—thus, it is called a great delusion.\n\nThe destitute, solitary, poor, and lowly are objects of shared compassion in well-ordered times and shared contempt in chaotic times. Yet a well-ordered age is not so because it pities the destitute, solitary, poor, and lowly—this is merely one aspect of good governance. A chaotic age is not so because it scorns the destitute, solitary, poor, and lowly—this is merely one aspect of disorder. When every matter is well-governed, there is no chaos; when chaos reigns, there is no order. Observe the prosperity of the Xia and Shang dynasties and their subsequent decline—this is the proof.\n\nThe hopes of the poor and lowly for wealth and nobility are exceedingly modest, yet the wealthy and noble cannot fulfill even these modest hopes. What the rich despise, the poor cherish; what the noble disregard, the lowly honor. Yet they do not reward or grant these things, for they do not share in the same joys and sorrows. Even if they do not reward them, it does no harm to themselves.\n\nNow, the hopes of the common people for their ruler are like those of the poor and lowly for the wealthy and noble. What they hope for is merely this: to care for the young and old, to balance taxes and levies, to provide for their hunger and cold, to tend to their illnesses and pains, to ensure rewards and punishments are not excessive, and to employ them at the proper times. This would cost the ruler nothing. Yet if he does not fulfill these hopes, it is because he does not share in their toil and rest.\n\nTherefore, the ruler must not fail to share in the toil and rest of the people. Thus, the wealthy and noble may not need to reward the poor and lowly, but the ruler cannot fail to reward the common people. If he does not reward the common people, they will not wish to support him. If they do not wish to support him, his position as ruler will be usurped. Nothing is more perilous, no disaster greater.\n\n**Collation Notes on the *Yinwenzi* (Recorded in the *Han Shu*):\nThe *Han Shu* records one chapter of the *Yinwenzi*. Toward the end of the Huangchu era of the Wei, the scholar Zhongchang of Shanyang divided it into two chapters. Thus, the *Sui Shu* lists two fascicles, which align with the present Daoist Canon edition. However, Tang scholars citing the *Yinwenzi* often reference passages absent in the current text. Upon repeated examination, it appears that bamboo slips were lost and merged into the latter chapter. Regrettably, the fragmentation is severe, leaving scattered fragments and orphaned sentences without proper placement. Here, following the *Siku Quanshu* edition, the text is recombined into a single fascicle, with separate collation notes appended. Should a latter-day Zhongchang emerge, a definitive edition may yet be established.\n—Inscribed by Xi Zuo\n\n**Original Preface:**\nThe version in the *Complete and Sufficient* Daoist Canon omits the character *zhi* (之), aligning with the *Zhuangzi*’s \"Tianxia\" chapter in meaning. The character *wan* (玩) in the Daoist Canon appears as *shen* (甚). The *Great Dao* above—what the unvirtuous treasure—*Laozi* writes *bao* (宝) as *bao* (保), the two being anciently interchangeable. When power is employed, it reverses into authority. The *Xu Rongzhai Biji* cites it as: \"When power is insufficient, it reverses into authority.\" The saying goes: \"A fine ox,\" and further: \"This cannot but be examined.\" The phrase \"又曰\" (*you yue*, \"furthermore says\") is superfluous and should be deleted, following the *Taiping Yulan* (899), which cites this passage. \"Thus, people measure length\" (故人以度审长短)—the character *gu* (故) is erroneous. The *Qunshu Zhiyao* cites it as *gu yi liang shou* (古以量受, \"anciently measured by capacity\"), while the Daoist Canon inverts the two characters, aligning with the *Zhiyao*. \"To govern confusion\" (以治烦惑)—the Daoist Canon writes *zhi* (治) as *zhi* (制), aligning with the *Zhiyao*. \"All affairs return to the One\" (以万事皆归于一)—the character *yi* (以) is superfluous and should be deleted, following the *Zhiyao*. \"Such are the stubborn, the deaf, and the blind\" (如此顽嚚聋瞽)—the *Zhiyao* cites this passage with the character *ze* (则) below *ru ci* (如此), which can discern the wise and the perceptive. The character *yi* (以) is erroneous; the *Jifu* edition writes *yu* (与), aligning with the *Zhiyao*. \"In governing together\" (同其治也)—the *Zhiyao* cites it as *yi* (矣). \"If one person could master all affairs under heaven\" (设一人能备天下之事)—the *Zhiyao* cites *neng* (能) as *ze* (则), attaching it to the following sentence. \"For farmers, merchants, artisans, and scholars\" (农商工士)—the Daoist Canon writes *shi* (士) as *shi* (仕), and the same below. \"Then what is left for the ruler above?\" (则处上者何事哉)—the *Zhiyao* writes *zhe* (者) as *you junzi fu yan changduan* (有君子弗言长短, \"there are gentlemen who do not speak of length and shortness\"). In the \"Government of the Humble\" chapter of the *Changduan Jing*, *fu* (弗) is written as *bu* (不), aligning with the *Zhiyao*. \"Gentlemen do not engage in debates over length and shortness\" (君子弗为长短经)—here, *fu* (弗) is also written as *bu* (不). Thus, \"the enlightened ruler does not do this\" (故明主不为此)—the two characters *bu wei* (不为) are erroneous and should follow the *Zhiyao* as *ren* (任, \"entrust\"), with the following text: \"Thus, the enlightened ruler punishes them.\" This directly corresponds to the preceding. \"The governance of external matters\" (治外之理)—petty men must speak of abilities beyond their duties. Here, text is missing and should follow the *Zhiyao*: \"The governance of external matters is what petty men must speak of; abilities beyond their duties are what petty men must engage in.\" Observing the following text: \"Petty men also know that speech harms governance yet cannot refrain from speaking; petty men also know that ability harms affairs yet cannot refrain from acting,\" it becomes clear that *yan* (言, \"speech\") is attached to *zhi* (治, \"governance\") and *neng* (能, \"ability\") to *shi* (事, \"affairs\"). \"Petty men also know that speech harms governance\" (小人亦知言损于治)—the *Zhiyao* cites *sun* (损, \"harms\") with the additional character *you* (有, \"there is\") above it, and the same in the following sentence. The ancient saying: \"Not knowing does no harm to the gentleman\" (不知无害于君子)—the *Zhiyao* cites this sentence with the character *gu* (故) at the beginning, and *yu* (于) as *wei* (为) in the following sentence, confirming this. The *Zhiyao* cites it as: \"These words are true indeed.\" \"To do good so others cannot attain it is to practice solitary virtue\" (为善使人不能得从此独善也). \"To craft skillfully so others cannot attain it is to practice solitary skill\" (为巧使人不能得从此独巧也). \"The principles of perfect goodness and skill are not yet exhausted\" (未尽善巧之理)—the *Zhiyao* cites this passage as: \"To do good so others cannot attain it, to craft skillfully so others cannot attain it, is to practice solitary virtue and solitary skill. The principles of perfect skill and goodness are not yet exhausted.\" The commentary on the \"Government of the Humble\" chapter of the *Changduan Jing* includes the character *zhe* (者) below *wei shan* (为善, \"to do good\") and *wei qiao* (为巧, \"to craft skillfully\"), with *zhe* (者) placed below *li* (理, \"principles\"). The rest aligns with the *Zhiyao*, showing that the Tang edition of the *Yinwenzi* was thus. \"What is prized in the sage’s governance\" (所贵圣人之治)—the *Xu Rongzhai Biji* cites this sentence with the character *gu* (故) at the beginning, aligning with the *Zhiyao*. \"Is prized for their ability to govern together with the multitude\" (贵其能与众共治)—the *Changduan Jing* cites *gong zhi* (共治, \"govern together\") with the character *ye* (也) below it, and the two characters *suo gui* (所贵, \"what is prized\") align with the *Zhiyao*. \"The solitary conduct of the worthy\" (独行之贤)—the *Changduan Jing* cites this sentence with the character *fu* (夫) at the beginning. \"The origin of chaos\" (乱之所由生)—the *Changduan Jing* cites this with the character *ye* (也). \"To employ the Dao to level their perils\" (任道以夷其险)—the *Zhiyao* writes *yi* (夷) as *tong* (通, \"unobstruct\"). \"To regulate with the Dao\" (制之有道也)—the \"Adapting to Change\" chapter of the *Changduan Jing* cites it as: \"In regulation, there is the Dao.\" \"All are not my use\" (皆非我用)—the character *yong* (用) is erroneous and should follow the *Zhiyao* as *ye* (也, \"is\"). \"Following what they employ\" (因彼所用)—the character *suo* (所) is erroneous and should follow the *Zhiyao* as *ke* (可, \"can\"). \"And naturally attain their use\" (而自得其用)—the *Zhiyao* cites this with the additional five characters *er zi de qi yong ye* (而自得其用也, \"and naturally attain their use\"). The *Changduan Jing* writes *hu* (乎) as *ye* (也). \"Then why worry about the chaos of things?\" (各奚患物之乱乎).**\n\nWhere the *Zhiyao* aligns: \"The wise and brave do not overstep\" (智勇者不陵)—the *Zhiyao* writes *ling* (陵) as *jin* (矜, \"self-assured\"), and adds \"fixed within their allotment\" (定于分也). The *Zhiyao* writes *ding* (定) as *zu* (足, \"sufficient\"). \"Thus, hearts all differ\" (故心皆殊)—the *Zhiyao* adds the character *ren* (人, \"people\") below *gu* (故). \"It must be governed to correct them\" (必为治以矫之)—the character *zhi* (治) is erroneous; the *Mingjifu* edition and the *Zang* edition both write it as *fa* (法, \"law\").\n\n\"Food does not differ from flesh\" (食不异肉)—the *Zang* edition writes *yi* (异) as *jian* (兼, \"to combine\"). The *Yulan* (689) cites this passage, and the *Shuchao* (143) writes it as \"to value people\" (重人), adding: \"All wear coarse cloth\" (皆大布之衣). Both the *Shuchao* and *Yulan* include the character *guo* (国, \"state\") above *ren* (人), which is omitted here.\n\nThe *Shuchao* (116) cites the line on King Goujian of Yue plotting revenge against Wu as: \"King Goujian, intending to avenge Wu, bowed to them\" (越王将报吴王而轼之). The *Shuchao* (85) and *Yulan* (543) both cite it as: \"Upon descending his chariot, he bowed\" (下车而揖之). The *Shuchao* (116) also writes it as: \"Turned his chariot to avoid them\" (回车避之). \"Within several years, the people—regardless of age—faced the enemy without shirking even boiling water or fire\" (比及数年民无长幼临敌虽汤火不避)—the *Shuchao* (116) cites it as: \"Later, in battle, the people did not avoid boiling water or fire\" (后战民皆不避汤火). This differs from the present text.\n\n\"Knowing how easily human sentiments shift\" (知人情之易动)—the *Zang* edition writes *ren* (人) as *min* (民, \"the common people\"). \"Though occupying a position of fame and rank, even the unworthy and foolish do not distance themselves from things\" (处名位虽不肖下愚物不疏己)—this passage is corrupt and missing text. The *Wenxuan* commentary on Ren Yansheng’s *Memorial in Recommendation of a Scholar* cites it as: \"Though occupying a position of fame and rank, even the unworthy do not worry that things will not draw near to them; in poverty and lowliness, they do not worry that things will distance themselves\" (处名位虽不肖不患物不亲己在贫贱不患物不疏己). Observing the following text—\"closeness and distance hinge on power and profit\" (亲疏系乎势利)—this passage should also address both closeness and distance. The character *xia yu* (下愚, \"foolish\") is an error; its form resembles *bu huan* (不患, \"do not worry\"). The *Zang* edition writes *xia* (下) as *bu* (不).\n\n\"That which has not yet wholly vanished does not depend on the unworthy or the humane and worthy\" (此其之未尽泯者不系于不肖与仁贤)—the *Wenxuan* commentary includes the character *ye* (也) here.\n\n\"To assess merit and demote or promote\" (君科功黜陟)—the *Zang* edition writes *ke* (科) as *liao* (料, \"to evaluate\"). The character *liao* (料) is also used below: \"to evaluate the young and old\" (料长幼). \"This is the virtue of a humane ruler, who may serve as lord\" (此仁君之德可以为主矣)—the *Xunzi* *Zheng Lun* commentary cites *ren* (仁) as *ren* (人, \"a ruler\") and *zhu* (主) as *wang* (王, \"king\"). The *Yulan* (389) cites it as: \"King Xuan of Qi\" (齐宣王). The *Lüshi Chunqiu* *Yong Se* chapter aligns, stating: \"In truth, what he used did not exceed three *dan*\" (其实所用不过三石). The *Shuchao* (125) and *Yulan* (389) both include the character *gong* (弓, \"bow\") below *yong* (用). This passage omits: \"All said it was no less than nine *dan*\" (皆曰不下九石). The *Shuchao* and *Yulan* both include the character *ci* (此) below *yue* (曰). \"And for his entire life, he believed it to be nine *dan*\" (而终身自以为九石)—the *Yulan* includes the character *yong* (用) below *wei* (为). \"And in the whole state, none dared to compete\" (而一国无聘者)—the *Yiwen Leiju* (18) cites it as: \"And in the whole state, none dared to compete\" (而一国之人无敢聘者). The *Yulan* (381) also includes the character *gan* (敢). \"In Wei, there was a widower\" (卫有鳏夫)—below *guan fu* (鳏夫), the character *shi* (失) is missing and should be supplemented following the *Yulan*.\n\n\"A traveler asked: 'What bird is this?'\" (路人问何鸟也)—the *Yulan* (917) includes the character *yue* (曰) below *wen* (问). Here, the character *zhi* (直) is written directly, but it is erroneous. The *Yiwen Leiju* (90) and *Yulan* (917) both write it as *shi* (始, \"at first\"): \"Then he said...\" (然则). \"Ten pieces of gold\" (十金)—the *Yiwen Leiju* and *Yulan* both write it as: \"Requested to buy for ten pieces of gold\" (请买十金). \"The traveler did not hesitate to value the gold\" (路人不遑惜金)—the *Yiwen Leiju* includes the character *qi* (其) below *xi* (惜). He said: \"It is a strange stone\" (谓之曰怪石也)—the *Yiwen Leiju* (83) and *Yulan* (805) both write *wei* (谓) as *zha* (诈, \"to deceive\"). Both the *Mingjifu* edition and the *Zang* edition include the character *ci* (此) below *yue* (曰), which is omitted here.\n\n\"It is not worth even one *fu*\" (弗如一复之)—the character *zhi* (之) is superfluous and should be deleted following the *Mingjifu* edition and the *Zang* edition. \"The farmer called his household and was greatly alarmed\" (田父称家大怖)—the character *cheng* (称) is erroneous. The *Yulan* cites it as *qi* (其, \"his\"). \"Thereupon, he hastily cast it into the distant wilds\" (于是遽而弃于远野)—the *Yulan* includes the character *zhi* (之) below *qi* (弃). \"Bowed twice and stood, daring to congratulate: 'Your Majesty has obtained this treasure of the world'\" (再拜而立敢贺曰王得此天下之宝)—this passage is corrupt. The *Yulan* writes it as: \"Bowed twice, stepped back, and stood, daring to congratulate: 'Great King, you have obtained this treasure of the world'\" (再拜却立曰敢贺大王得此天下之宝). The *Liutie* (7) aligns. The *Yiwen Leiju* writes it as: \"Bowed twice and congratulated: 'Great King, you have obtained this treasure of the world'\" (再拜贺曰大王得此天下之宝). This likely abbreviates the text.\n\n\"King Wen asked the price\" (王问价)—the *Mingjifu* edition and the *Zang* edition both include the character *qi* (其) below *wen* (问), aligning with the *Yiwen Leiju* citation. \"The salary of an upper grandee\" (食上大夫禄)—the *Yiwen Leiju* includes the character *zhi* (之) below *da fu* (大夫).\n\nWhere the *Zhiyao* aligns: \"The Great Dao\" (大道)—the *Zhiyao* writes it as the \"Sage\" chapter (圣人篇). \"The means by which to conduct oneself with reverence\" (所以行恭谨)—the *Zhiyao* cites it as *jin jing* (谨敬, \"reverent respect\"). The *Changduan Jing* *Fan Jing* chapter writes it as *jing jin* (敬谨, \"respectful reverence\"). \"This is also how to violate proper roles\" (亦所以乖名分)—the *Zhiyao* and *Changduan Jing* both write it as: \"This is also how to generate violations of proper roles\" (亦所以生乖分). \"Not to flee of one’s own accord from the court of Jie and Zhou\" (非自逃于桀纣之朝)—the character *zi* (自) in *Zhiyao* is written as *gu* (故, \"thus\"). \"Lose the Dao, and the world falls into chaos\" (失其道则天下乱)—the *Zhiyao* includes the character *yong* (用) above *shi* (失). \"To bind the myriad beings\" (笼络万品)—the *Zhiyao* writes *long* (笼) as *chan* (缠, \"to entangle\"). \"In a state of disorder\" (有乱国)—the *Zhiyao* cites this line under \"a state in decline\" (衰国), aligning with the following text.\n\n\"The lord is aged and has many concubines\" (君年长多媵)—the *Changduan Jing* *Li Luan* chapter includes the character *qie* (妾, \"concubine\") below *duo* (多), aligning with the *Zhiyao*. The *Mingjifu* edition writes it as *ying qie* (媵妾, \"concubines\"). \"To alienate the clan\" (疏宗族)—the *Mingjifu* edition and the *Zang* edition both write *zu* (族) as *qiang* (强, \"powerful\"), aligning with the *Zhiyao*. \"Not awaiting the arrival of cruelty and violence\" (不待凶恶残暴)—the *Zhiyao* writes *e* (恶) as *nüe* (虐, \"tyranny\"), aligning with the preceding text.\n\n\"The branches and descendants multiply\" (支庶繁)—the *Changduan Jing* writes *fan* (繁) as *xi* (息, \"to grow\"), aligning with the *Zhiyao*. \"The superiors cannot overcome their subordinates\" (上不胜其下)—\"The subordinates do not offend their superiors\" (下不犯其上). The *Changduan Jing* includes the character *neng* (能, \"can\") below both *bu* (不) characters, aligning with the *Zhiyao*. The *Zang* edition also includes *neng* (能) in the latter line.\n\n\"Who says it is perplexing?\" (孰曰荧惑)—the character *yue* (曰) is erroneous and should be written as *neng* (能) following the *Mingjifu* edition. \"To receive it in speech and action before others\" (承之于言行之先)—below this, 124 characters are missing and should be supplemented following the *Zhiyao*: \"The common people of the world rejoice at praise and grieve at blame—this is the great sentiment of the multitude. Those who share their views are pleased; those who differ are angered—this is the great sentiment of people. Thus, flatterers are skilled at praising and adept at compliance. They affirm what others affirm and deny what others deny, follow what others love and align with what others detest. Therefore, though a wise lord may accept the upright, he does not necessarily befriend them; though he may distance flatterers, he does not necessarily alienate them. Thus, Shun and Yu, though able to reject flatterers, did not necessarily detest them. As the saying goes: 'Flattery and sophistry confuse things'—even Shun and Yu could not come to detest them. This cannot but be examined closely!\" (正世俗之人闻誉则悦闻毁则戚此众人之大情有同己则喜异己则怒此人之大情故佞人善为誉者也善顺从者也人言是亦是之人言非亦非之从人之所爱随人之所憎故明君虽能纳正直未必亲正直虽能远佞人未必能疏佞人故舜禹者以能不用佞人亦未必憎佞人语曰佞辨惑物舜禹不能得憎不可不察乎).\n\nExamining the final particle *hu* (乎), it should read *ye* (也). In governing the state, *Laozi* uses *zheng* (政) and *zheng* (正) interchangeably as anciently accepted. How can one govern through fear of death? *Zhiyao* cites it as: \"How can one govern them through fear of death?\" The *Shaozi* states: *Ou Ming*. The *Jifu* edition reads *ou* (殴) below, identically. Yet *Taiping Yulan* 405 cites it as: \"One responds with truth.\" The characters *bin ke wang fu* (宾客往复) are mistakenly inverted; they should follow the *Mingji* and *Jifu* editions, transposed as *fu wang* (复往). *Yiwen Leiju* 94, *Taiping Yulan* 405, and 905 all cite it as *fu wang* (复往). The people of Zheng call unworked jade *pu* (璞). The *Hou Hanshu* commentary by Ying Shao reads *li* (理) as *zhuo* (琢). To the Zheng merchant, it is said in *Yiwen Leiju* 83: \"It is asked...\" The text above this is missing 116 characters, which should be supplemented according to *Zhiyao* as follows:\n\nTianzi said: \"People all act for themselves and cannot act for others. Therefore, one who rules others employs them to act for themselves, not to act for his own use.\" Mr. Wei below remarked: \"Excellent indeed are Tianzi’s words! In ancient times, when a ruler employed his ministers, he sought not private affection for himself but manifest loyalty to himself. Thus, those who held office were necessarily capable, and those who faced battle were necessarily brave. Encouraged by emoluments and rewards, aligned by fame and law, their actions did not arise from their own hearts nor profit their own persons.\" As the saying goes: \"One with meager emoluments cannot be entrusted with enduring chaos; one with paltry rewards cannot be entrusted with facing peril.\" These are matters the superior must carefully consider.\n\n[Note: The passage beginning \"One with meager emoluments...\" is also found in *Yilin* and *Taiping Yulan* 633, which states: \"Such commands will certainly not be carried out.\"] *Changduan Jing*, in the \"Governance and Institutions\" chapter, includes the character *shang* (上) here, stating: \"One must be cautious about what one commands.\" *Changduan Jing* renders it as: \"One must be cautious about the commands one issues.\" *Zhiyao* also includes the character *yan* (焉). Though it is said that the wise and capable are alike, the character *sui* (虽) is mistaken and should follow the *Mingji* and *Jifu* editions, reading *wei* (惟). The arrogant know no suffering. *Zhiyao* omits the character *xia* (下) but includes *suo* (所). It is like the poor and lowly longing for wealth and nobility. *Zhiyao* includes the character *zhe* (者) after *pin jian* (贫贱). Thus, the wealthy and noble cannot but requite the poor and lowly. *Zhiyao* cites it as connecting to the following sentence. *Yiwen* records: *Yinwenzi* saw King Xuan of Qi.\n\nKing Xuan sighed without speaking. Yin Wenzi asked, \"Why do you sigh?\" The king said, \"I sigh that there are few worthy men in my state.\" Yin Wenzi said, \"*If* the state were entirely composed of worthy men, who would remain beneath the king?\" *Yilin* includes the phrase \"who would serve the king\" after this. The king said, \"Would it be acceptable if the state were entirely composed of the unworthy?\" Yin Wenzi said, \"*If* the state were entirely composed of the unworthy, who would govern the king’s court?\" The king said, \"Would it be acceptable if there were neither the worthy nor the unworthy?\" Yin Wenzi said, \"Not so. It is because there are both the worthy and the unworthy that the king is exalted above while ministers are humble below. Promoting the worthy and demoting the unworthy—this is how the distinction between above and below is maintained.\"\n\n*Yilin*, *Yiwen Leiju* (20), and *Taiping Yulan* (402) also record:\nA tiger sought among the beasts to devour them. It caught a fox. The fox said, \"Do not eat me. The Celestial Emperor has made me chief of the beasts. If you eat me now, you will defy the Celestial Emperor’s command. If you do not believe my words, I will walk ahead of you, and you may follow behind me. Observe whether the beasts flee at the sight of me.\" The tiger agreed. Thus, they proceeded together, and the beasts all fled upon seeing them. The tiger did not realize that the beasts fled from *itself* but believed they fled from the fox.\n\n*Taiping Yulan* (494) records:\nThe blind have no eyes, yet their ears cannot be used for *●* (inspection/observation). They excel in listening.\n\n*Taiping Yulan* (740) records:\nThe deaf do not sing, for they have no means of delighting themselves. The blind do not observe, for they have no means of engaging with things. (Same source as above.)\n\nNumbers—ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred million—all arise from one. Extending this to the hundred million, the hundred million is without error.\n\n*Taiping Yulan* (750) records:\nA thousand men are called *jun* (outstanding); ten thousand men, *jie* (heroic). The *Shiji*’s \"Postface to the Biography of Qu Yuan\" and the *Maoshi*’s \"Jian Jia Ru\" commentary also render ten thousand men as *ying* (elite).\n\nThose who seek by wit and strength are like players of *yi* (a board game). *Leiju* (74) notes: The character *yi* is repeated, with no *qi* (chess) character.\n\nAdvancing and retreating, seizing and yielding, attacking and capturing, releasing and abandoning—*Wen Xuan*’s commentary on \"On Gambling\" states: *Fang* (releasing) means *sha* (capturing) when it is my turn.\n\n*Taiping Yulan* (753) records:\nThe gambler exhausts the proper openings and closings, attains the paths of thoroughfare, yet cannot control the size of the pieces—it depends on what one encounters.\n\n*Yiwen Leiju* (82) and *Taiping Yulan* (996) record:\nWhen Yao was Son of Heaven, his robes were not layered in silk, his meals not doubled in flavor. His earthen steps were but three feet high, his thatched roof untrimmed.\n\nYao’s virtuous transformation spread across the Four Seas; his benevolence and kindness covered all living beings. *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on \"Exhortation to Ascend the Throne\" notes:\n\nTwo wisdoms cannot employ each other; two nobles cannot overlook each other; two eloquent speakers cannot subdue each other—this is because their strength and power are evenly matched. *Yilin* records:\n\nRelying solely on brightness, no achievement is completed; relying solely on obscurity, affairs must go awry. One bright, one obscure—this is what the multitude supports.\n\nThe *Hou Hanshu*’s commentary on the \"Biography of Feng Yan\" states:\nThe four directions, above and below, are called *yu* (the universe).\n\nBefore battle, officials read the proclamations and oaths, repeatedly issuing the Three Commands and Five Admonitions. Once this is done...\n\nThen they engaged the enemy. *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on the *\"Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody\"* states:\n\nThe sound of bells and drums—when struck in anger, it is martial; when struck in sorrow, it is mournful; when struck in joy, it is joyous. As the intent shifts, so too does the sound. When the intent is sincere, it moves even metal and stone—how much more so for men? *Shu Chao*, Scroll 108.",

Composed by Yin Wen of the Zhou.\n\nA preface by Zhongchang of Shanyang, dated the end of the Huangchu era of Wei, states that the text was arranged and finalized into upper and lower chapters. The *Wenxian Tongkao* records it as two juan, while this edition also titles them *The Way Above* and *The Way Below*, consistent with the preface, though compiled into a single juan—likely a later consolidation.\n\nIn the *Zhuangzi*’s \"Below in the World\" chapter, Yin Wen is mentioned alongside Tian Pian. Yan Shigu’s commentary on the *Hanshu* identifies him as a contemporary of King Xuan of Qi. This is corroborated by Liu Xiang’s *Shuo Yuan*, which records his dialogues with King Xuan. However, the *Lüshi Chunqiu* also documents his exchanges with King Min, suggesting he may have lived from the reign of King Xuan into that of King Min.\n\nThe work belongs to the School of Names, its central theme expounding the principles of governance. It advocates self-cultivation through emptiness and stillness while meticulously examining the realities of all affairs and things. Thus, its discourse traverses the boundaries of the Huang-Lao and Shen-Han traditions. Zhou’s marginal notes aptly observe its progression from the Dao to names, and from names to laws—a true reflection of its essence.\n\nChao Gongwu’s *Dushu Zhi* mistakenly claims it recites the methods of Confucius, a statement rightly ridiculed by Gao Sisun in his *Weilüe*. Yet Gao’s own critique, measuring it by Confucian principles and deeming it confused, is equally unjust. Amidst the clamor of a hundred schools and the parallel existence of nine streams, each venerates its own insights and practices its own knowledge. From Laozi and Zhuangzi onward, each established its own distinct doctrine. The reader of such texts should value their breadth, eloquence, and unbridled expressiveness—how could one confine them to a single mold?\n\nThe Xibo mentioned in the preface is likely Miao Xi’s courtesy name. The identity of the \"Zhongchang of Shanyang\" remains uncertain. Li Xianchen suggests it was Zhongchang Tong, but Tong died at the end of the Jian’an era, which does not align with the \"end of Huangchu.\" Chao Gongwu’s subsequent doubt about historical errors is an overreach.\n\n**Original Preface**",

      "translated_text": "The *Yinwenzi* likely originated from the Yin clan of the Zhou. During the reign of King Xuan of Qi, its author resided at Jixia, studying alongside Song Jian, Peng Meng, and Tian Pian under Gongsun Long. Gongsun Long praised him and composed a single work, which synthesized much wisdom. Zhuangzi said: \"Unburdened by things, uncompromising toward others, unmoved by the crowd, desiring the world’s peace to preserve the lives of the people—providing for oneself and others until sufficiency is reached, and thus purifying the heart. Though insulted, one feels no disgrace—such is his Dao.\" Liu Xiang also traced its teachings to the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, broadly classifying it as a School of Names. Recent claims that it is slanderous are unfounded.\n\nAt the end of the Huangchu era, I first arrived in the capital. Miao Xibo showed me this text, and though I suspected he had studied it extensively, it contained many omissions and errors. I tentatively arranged and edited it into two scrolls, the *Upper* and *Lower*, though I could not exhaustively examine its details.\n\n**Composed by the Zhongchang of Shanyang**\n\n**The Great Dao (Upper Scroll)**\n\nThe Great Dao is formless. Only when it takes shape in vessels does it acquire names. Names are what rectify forms. When forms are rectified by names, names must not err. Thus, Confucius said: \"It is necessary to rectify names.\" If names are not rectified, speech will not be proper.\n\nThe Great Dao is not named, yet all things must be named. Born from the unnamable, the myriad forms naturally attain their squares and circles. Names arise from squares and circles, and thus all names find their proper designation.\n\nWhen the Great Dao governs, the schools of Names, Laws, Confucians, and Mohists naturally fade. Yet those who govern by Names, Laws, Confucians, or Mohists cannot depart from the Dao. Laozi said: \"The Dao is the mystery of the ten thousand things, the treasure of the good, and what the ungood treasure.\" Those who govern by the Dao are called good; those who rely on Names, Laws, Confucians, or Mohists are called ungood. The distinction between good and ungood grows daily clearer, discernible without close examination.\n\nWhen the Dao is insufficient to govern, laws are employed. When laws are insufficient, techniques are used. When techniques are insufficient, power is wielded. When power is insufficient, authority is asserted. The use of authority reverts to power; the use of power reverts to techniques; the use of techniques reverts to laws; the use of laws reverts to the Dao. When the Dao is employed, governance is effortless and self-sustaining. Thus, when exhausted, one seeks an end; when the end is reached, one returns to the beginning. Beginning and end follow one another endlessly.\n\nWhat has form must have a name, but what has a name does not necessarily have form. A form without a name does not necessarily lose its true square, circle, white, or black. Yet names cannot be left unexamined, for names correct deviations. Thus, names may check forms, forms may fix names, names may fix affairs, and affairs may verify names. By examining their underlying principles, the relationship between forms, names, affairs, and things reveals no hidden truths.\n\nNames have three categories, and laws have four manifestations.\n**Names:**\n1. Names that designate things—square, circle, white, black.\n2. Names of praise and blame—good, evil, noble, base.\n3. Names of analogy and reference—worthy, foolish, love, hatred.\n\n**Laws:**\n1. Unchanging laws—ruler and minister, superior and inferior.\n2. Laws that harmonize customs—competence and ineptitude, similarity and difference.\n3. Laws for governing the masses—rewards, punishments, penalties.\n4. Laws of standardization—measures, weights, scales, and balances.\n\n**Techniques** are what the ruler employs in secret; the masses must not rashly pry into them. **Authority** is the sharp instrument for enacting laws; the masses must not rashly wield it. If the ruler possesses techniques yet allows the masses to glimpse their mysteries, or holds authority yet permits the masses to usurp its weight, the crux lies in first rectifying names and divisions to prevent encroachment. Only then can techniques remain hidden and authority remain concentrated.\n\nNames name forms, and forms respond to names. Yet forms do not rectify names, nor do names rectify forms. Thus, names and forms are distinctly separate—they cannot be confused, nor can they be without one another. Without names, the Great Dao is unnamable; with names, names rectify forms.\n\nNow, the ten thousand things exist, and without names to rectify them, chaos ensues. The myriad names are arrayed, and without forms to correspond, discord arises. Thus, forms and names cannot remain unrectified.\n\nGood names designate goodness; evil names designate evil. Therefore, goodness has good names, and evil has evil names. The sage, the worthy, the benevolent, and the wise are designated by good names. The obstinate, the perverse, the cruel, and the foolish are designated by evil names.\n\nYet even when using the names of sages, worthies, benevolence, and wisdom to seek their true essence, one may not fully attain it. Likewise, using the names of the obstinate, perverse, cruel, and foolish to seek their true essence may not fully capture it. If goodness and evil are clearly distinguished, even if one cannot exhaust the reality of things, one need not fear deviation. Thus, it is said: names cannot be left unexamined.\n\nNames and designations distinguish this from that and verify the real from the false. From ancient times to the present, none have succeeded by using the latter and failed by using the former. Failure stems from the confusion of names and divisions; success stems from their careful examination.\n\nNow, to draw near the worthy and distance the unworthy, to reward the good and punish the evil—the names of worthy and unworthy, good and evil belong to them, while the designations of nearness and distance, reward and punishment belong to me. Between me and them, there is yet another name: the examination of names.\n\nTo name the worthy and unworthy as nearness and distance, to name good and evil as reward and punishment, and to conflate these designations without distinction—this is the confusion of names. Thus, it is said: names and designations cannot be left unexamined.\n\nAs the saying goes...",

      "translated_text": "Love and hatred, preference and aversion, fondness and rejection—these are my divisions. When these names and divisions are fixed, all affairs remain orderly.\n\nThus, people measure length with standards, determine quantity with measures, balance weight with scales, harmonize pitch with tuning, verify truth with names, settle order and chaos with laws, resolve confusion with simplicity, and overcome peril with ease. In all matters, they return to the One; in all measures, they conform to the Law.\n\nReturning to the One is the utmost simplicity; conforming to the Law is the ultimate ease. In this way, even the stubborn, the deaf, and the blind can attain the discernment of the wise and the clarity of the perceptive—united in governance.\n\nThe myriad affairs of the world cannot all be mastered. To demand such mastery from one person is to burden even the worthy and the sage. Suppose one person could possess all the world’s skills—yet in the appropriateness of left and right, front and back, far and near, slow and swift, there would still be incompleteness. Where there is incompleteness, governance is lacking. Perfect governance without deficiency lies in great and small, many and few, each fitting its division: farmer and merchant, artisan and official do not exchange their trades; the veteran farmer, the seasoned merchant, the skilled artisan, and the experienced scholar all remain in their places. Then what is left for the ruler to do?\n\nThus, the noble person does not speak of principles that, though sound, do not benefit governance. The noble person does not act on abilities that, though competent, do not advance affairs. The noble person does not delight in speech, but when it benefits governance, cannot refrain from speaking. The noble person does not delight in action, but when it advances affairs, cannot refrain from acting. Therefore, what they speak does not extend beyond names, laws, authority, and strategy; what they do does not extend beyond farming, warfare, and military formations—attending to essential duties and nothing more.\n\nThe enlightened ruler does not pursue principles beyond governance. The petty person must speak of abilities beyond affairs. The petty person knows their words harm governance yet cannot refrain from speaking; they know their actions harm affairs yet cannot refrain from acting. Thus, what they speak culminates in the debates of Confucians and Mohists over right and wrong; what they do culminates in obstinate, deceptive, biased, and defiant conduct—seeking reputation and nothing more. Therefore, the enlightened ruler punishes them.\n\nAn ancient saying goes: \"Ignorance does no harm to the noble person; knowledge does no good to the petty person. The craftsman’s inability does no harm to skill; the noble person’s ignorance does no harm to governance.\" This is true.\n\nTo do good in a way that others cannot follow is solitary virtue. To craft skill in a way that others cannot follow is solitary skill. These do not exhaust the principles of goodness and skill. To do good alongside the multitude and to craft skill alongside others—this is the highest goodness, the highest skill.\n\nWhat is prized in the sage’s governance is not their solitary rule but their ability to govern together with the people. What is prized in the skill of the master craftsman is not their solitary skill but their ability to craft together with others.\n\nYet people today desire to be uniquely worthy in conduct, uniquely capable in affairs, surpassing in eloquence, and peerless in courage. Solitary worth cannot transform the world; solitary ability cannot attend to all duties. Eloquence that surpasses the crowd cannot be explained door-to-door; courage that outstrips the multitude cannot be deployed in battle. These four traits are the source of chaos.\n\nThus, the sage employs the Way to level peril, establishes laws to regulate disparities, ensuring the worthy and the foolish do not abandon one another, the capable and the base do not neglect one another. When the capable and the base do not neglect one another, their contributions are equal; when the worthy and the foolish do not abandon one another, their considerations are alike. This is the art of perfect governance.\n\nWhen names are fixed, things do not compete; when divisions are clear, self-interest does not prevail. Things do not compete not because they lack intent, but because names are fixed—thus they have no place to direct their intent. Self-interest does not prevail not because they lack desire, but because divisions are clear—thus they have no place to direct their desire. Though intent and desire exist in everyone, they can be made to resemble the absence of intent and desire through proper regulation.\n\nTian Pian said: \"The scholars of the world...\"",

Yet though they wander to the courts of the feudal lords, all aspire to become ministers and grandees, none presuming to rival the lords themselves—this is the limit set by names.\n\nPeng Meng said: \"When pheasants and hares roam the wilds, the masses pursue them, for their division is not yet fixed. But when chickens and pigs fill the market, none covet them, for their division is settled. When things are in excess, benevolence and wisdom are subdued; when divisions are fixed, the greedy and base do not contend. A wheel turns not because it can turn, but because it cannot but turn. A square block rests not because it can rest, but because it cannot but rest. Thus, by following the wheel’s natural turning, one prevents it from stopping; by following the block’s natural resting, one prevents it from rolling. Why trouble over things losing their proper place? Therefore, by relying on the capable’s usefulness, one ensures they cannot but be used; by relying on the incapable’s uselessness, one ensures they cannot be used. Whether used or unused, neither is of my own doing—it is by following what they themselves can or cannot do that their proper use is achieved. How then could one fear the disorder of things?\n\nAll things cannot themselves be capable, nor can they themselves know. The wise are not wise because they can be wise, nor are the foolish foolish because they can be foolish. The lovely are not lovely because they can be lovely, nor are the ugly ugly because they can be ugly. If they cannot themselves be capable or know, then what is there to value in wisdom or beauty? What is there to despise in foolishness or ugliness? Thus, the wise cannot boast over the foolish, nor can the lovely mock the ugly—this is the Way of attaining harmony.\n\nWhen the Dao prevails in the world, the poor and lowly do not resent, the rich and noble do not arrogate, the foolish and weak do not cower, and the wise and brave do not oppress—all is settled by their proper place. When the law prevails in the world, the poor and lowly dare not resent the rich and noble, the rich and noble dare not oppress the poor and lowly, the foolish and weak dare not aspire to the wise and brave, and the wise and brave dare not despise the foolish and weak—this is where the law falls short of the Dao.\n\nWhat the world values, when all value it together, is called custom. What the world uses, when all use it together, is called convention. If one goes against others, custom will not align; if one offends the multitude, custom will cast one out. Thus, though minds differ, conduct appears uniform; though preferences vary, resources and uses must align—this is how custom levels all. This is how convention adorns all. Therefore, what is leveled must be approached with care, and what is adorned must be chosen with discernment.\n\nOf old, Duke Huan of Qi favored purple robes, and throughout his realm none sold garments of other hues.

      "translated_text": "Thus arises the origin of order and chaos.\n\nWhen custom turns pernicious, governance must be established to correct it. When convention overflows its bounds, regulations must be set to restrain it. Those ensnared by custom and adorned by convention cannot partake in governance.\n\nOf old, the state of Jin suffered from extravagance, and Duke Wen corrected it with frugality. He wore no layered silks and ate no meat but the simplest fare. In no time, all in his realm donned coarse cloth and ate plain grain. King Goujian of Yue, plotting vengeance against Wu, sought to make his people brave. When he encountered an angry toad upon the road, he bowed to it in respect. Within a few years, none in his land, young or old, would flinch from fire or boiling water in the face of battle.\n\nSuch is the palpable difficulty of those above. The sage-kings, knowing how readily human nature sways, composed music to harmonize it and instituted rites to moderate it. Those below were thus denied the use of their private inclinations, and rites and music alone prevailed. When rites and music alone prevail, private desires wane and fade. When private desires wane and fade, encountering the worthy and encountering the foolish become one and the same. If encountering the worthy brings order and encountering the foolish brings chaos, then order and chaos hinge upon worthiness and foolishness, not upon rites and music. Thus, the art of the sages perishes with the sage-rulers, and the laws of well-ordered ages fall into disuse with the passing of generations. Chaos then abounds while order dwindles. When chaos abounds and order dwindles, the worthy gain no esteem, and the foolish suffer no disgrace.\n\nThose who occupy high rank, though base and benighted, find no estrangement from others. Closeness and distance depend upon power and profit, not upon baseness or worthiness, benevolence or wisdom. I dare not claim this as the principle of Heaven, but rather as the natural tendency of earthly conditions. Now, between Heaven and Earth, the base are indeed many, and the benevolent and worthy are indeed few. The impulse to seek profit is strong in the base, while the sense of integrity and shame is more pronounced in the benevolent and worthy. If one summons the benevolent and worthy with rites and justice, those obtained will be but one in ten thousand. If one summons the base with fame and profit, the base will be found everywhere. Thus it is said: rites and justice perfect the noble person, though the noble person does not necessarily require rites and justice. Fame and profit govern the petty person, and the petty person cannot do without fame and profit.\n\nRewards and punishments are the sovereign’s affairs. Upholding duties and demonstrating competence are the minister’s tasks. The sovereign assesses merit and demotes or promotes accordingly, hence the use of rewards and punishments. Ministers each attend diligently to their duties, hence the fulfillment of their roles. The sovereign must not encroach upon the minister’s tasks, nor the minister upon the sovereign’s affairs. When above and below do not encroach upon one another, this is called \"proper naming.\" When names are proper, the law follows smoothly.\n\nTo engage with the myriad things so that each is distinct, to govern all within the seas so that none is confused, to suffer insult without shame, to receive praise without pride, to suppress violence and still the blades of war—these are the virtues of a humane ruler, one who may be called a true sovereign.\n\nTo uphold one’s duties without disorder, to be prudent in one’s tasks without partiality, to maintain a single mind whether sated or hungry, to weigh praise and blame with equal consideration, to neither forget rewards nor resent punishments—these are the disciplines of one below, one who may be called a true minister.\n\nIn this world, some gain substance through reputation, while others lose substance through reputation. King Xuan of Qi was fond of archery and delighted in others saying he could draw a strong bow. In truth, his strength did not exceed three *dan*. To demonstrate this to his courtiers, they all drew the bow to test it, stopping at the halfway point, and declared, \"None but Your Majesty could draw such a bow—it must be no less than nine *dan*!\" King Xuan was pleased. Yet in reality, his strength did not exceed three *dan*, and he lived out his days believing it to be nine. Three *dan* was the reality; nine *dan* was the name. King Xuan rejoiced in the name and lost the reality.\n\nIn Qi, there was a man called Huang Gong who was fond of humility. He had two daughters, both of peerless beauty. Because of their loveliness, he constantly belittled and disparaged them, calling them ugly. The reputation of their ugliness spread far and wide, and though they passed marriageable age, no one in the state sought their hand. A widower from Wei, taking a chance, married one, and she proved to be of peerless beauty. Only then did people say, \"Huang Gong was fond of humility, so he slandered his daughters as unlovely.\" Thereupon, suitors vied to offer betrothal gifts, and the other daughter, too, was found to be of peerless beauty. Peerless beauty was the reality; ugliness was the name. Here, by defying the name, one gained the reality.\n\nA man from Chu was carrying mountain pheasants when a traveler asked what bird it was. The pheasant-carrier deceived him, saying, \"It is a phoenix.\" The traveler said, \"I have heard of the phoenix, and now I have seen one with my own eyes. Are you selling it?\" The man replied...",

Its value soared, and the traveler wished to present it to the king. When the King of Chu heard of this, he was moved by the man’s desire to offer it to him. He summoned the traveler and bestowed upon him a reward ten times greater than the gold paid for the bird.\n\nIn Wei, a farmer plowing in the wilds unearthed a jade disk measuring a foot in diameter. Not recognizing it as jade, he showed it to his neighbor. The neighbor, secretly coveting it, said, \"It is a strange stone. Keep it, and it will bring no benefit to your household. Better to throw it away.\" Though the farmer doubted, he still took it home and placed it beneath the eaves. That night, the jade glowed, illuminating the entire room. The farmer, declaring his household greatly alarmed, again consulted his neighbor. \"This is an omen of misfortune,\" the neighbor said. \"Cast it away at once, and the calamity may be averted.\" The farmer promptly discarded it in a distant field. Before long, the neighbor stole it and presented it to the King of Wei. The king summoned a jade artisan to examine it. Upon seeing it, the artisan bowed twice and stood, offering his congratulations: \"Your Majesty has obtained a treasure of the world. Your servant has never beheld its equal.\" The king asked its value. The artisan replied, \"This jade is beyond price.

      "translated_text": "All things bear right and wrong—this I dare not falsify. What is right remains ever right; what is wrong remains ever wrong—this I hold as truth. Yet though right is ever right, there are times it goes unused; though wrong is ever wrong, there are times it must be done. Thus, employing right may bring loss, while acting wrong may bring gain. The principles of right and wrong differ, and their rise and fall alternate, turning to serve my ends—where then do right and wrong reside?\n\nObserve the achievements of Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu: some followed the Way, some defied it, yet seizing the moment brought prosperity. The downfalls of Jie, Zhou, You, and Li: some were right, some were wrong, yet missing the moment brought ruin. The hegemons of the Five Lords followed the same pattern.\n\nWhen Duke Xiang of Song fought the Chu at Hong, his minister Zimu said, \"The Chu outnumber us—let us strike before they finish crossing the river.\" The duke replied, \"No. I have heard one does not attack an unformed battle line. Though I am the remnant of a ruined state, I dare not do this.\" The battle was lost, and the Chu captured the duke.\n\nWhen the people of Qi murdered Duke Xiang and enthroned Duke Wuzhi, Shaohu and Yiwu escorted Prince Jiu in flight to Lu, while Bao Shuya escorted Prince Xiaobo to Ju. Soon after, Wuzhi was killed, and the two princes vied for the throne. Jiu was the rightful heir, but Xiaobo arrived first, so the Qi people enthroned him. Later, he forced the Lu to kill Jiu. Shaohu died for him, while Yiwu was summoned to serve as minister. When Duke Wen of Jin was slandered by Li Ji, he went into exile for nineteen years. After Duke Hui died, he bribed Qin to regain his state, killed Prince Huai, and usurped the throne.\n\nOne ruler acted rightly yet was not spared capture; two rulers acted wrongly yet achieved hegemony. If one is right while the world deems one wrong, one may not recognize one’s own rightness. If one is wrong while the world deems one right, one may not recognize one’s own wrong. Thus, right and wrong follow the market of the crowd to become correct—not something one can decide alone. To defy the crowd is wrong; to follow it is right.\n\nTherefore, when a ruler wields power and seizes opportunity, standing where all deem right, none dare condemn him. At rest, all honor him; in motion, all follow him; in speech, all trust him; in action, all emulate him. This is how he resides above all and governs those below.\n\nA state falls into chaos through three things: famine, when the people scatter—without food to gather them, chaos ensues; lack of law, when governance has no standard, chaos ensues; or laws exist but are not enforced, chaos ensues. With food to gather the people and laws that are enforced, a state cannot fail to be well-ordered.\n\nThe Great Dao declines, and benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music, names, laws, punishments, and rewards arise—these eight are the arts by which the Five Emperors and Three Kings governed the world. Thus, benevolence guides them, righteousness makes them fitting, ritual enacts them, music harmonizes them, names rectify them, laws unify them, punishments awe them, and rewards encourage them.\n\nYet benevolence, though it broadly bestows upon all, also breeds partiality; righteousness, though it establishes integrity, also fosters hypocrisy; ritual, though it enacts reverence, also engenders laziness and disdain; music, though it harmonizes the emotions, also gives rise to licentiousness; names, though they rectify hierarchy, also breed arrogance and usurpation; laws, though they unify differences, also disrupt proper order; punishments, though they awe the disobedient, also breed oppression and violence; rewards, though they encourage loyalty and ability, also breed vulgar competition.\n\nThese eight arts are never hidden from people and always exist in the world. They did not first appear in the eras of Yao and Tang, nor did they vanish in the courts of Jie and Zhou. When used rightly, the world is well-ordered; when misused, the world falls into chaos. Beyond these, though one may encompass heaven and earth and embrace all things, such matters lie outside the Way of governance—beings do not feed upon them, and the sage sets them aside without comment.\n\nAll states exhibit six signs in their rise and fall: declining states, doomed states, flourishing states, strong states, well-ordered states, and chaotic states. The so-called chaotic and doomed states are not merely those of cruelty and violence; the so-called strong and well-ordered states are not merely those of might and virtue.\n\nA ruler who is aged, has many concubines, few descendants, and estranged clansmen—this is a declining state. A ruler who favors ministers, whose ministers adore him, where public law is abandoned and private desires prevail—this is a chaotic state. A state that is poor and small, where families are rich and great, the ruler’s authority is light, and ministers’ power is heavy—this is a doomed state. These three signs do not require cruelty or violence to weaken a state. Though it may appear to survive, I must call it doomed.

Peril and ruin follow on their heels.\n\nLaozi said: 'Govern the state with upright governance, employ the army with extraordinary tactics, and win the world through non-action.' Governance refers to names and laws. To govern the state with names and laws is to leave nothing in disorder. Extraordinary tactics refer to power and strategy. To employ the army with power and strategy is to leave nothing unconquered. If one can wield names, laws, power, and strategy to restrain and suppress the impulses of cruelty and violence, then one remains without trouble. Being without trouble, one gains the world.\n\nThus, when governance fails, rely on law; when law fails, rely on arms—all to seek non-action, not to seize strength. For if one seizes strength, even the yielding may turn and subdue it.\n\nLaozi said: 'When the people do not fear death, how can they be frightened by it?' When the people do not fear death, it is because punishments are excessive. When punishments are excessive, the people no longer rely on life. With no reliance on life, they regard the ruler’s might as nothing. When punishments are measured, the people fear death. Fearing death arises from the joy of life.

      "translated_text": "The elder then truthfully explained the matter. Thereupon, he changed the names. Guests came and went once more.\n\nThe people of Zheng called uncut jade *pu*. The people of Zhou called an unsalted rat *pu*. A man of Zhou, carrying *pu*, said to a merchant of Zheng, \"Would you like to buy *pu*?\" The merchant of Zheng replied, \"I would.\" The man of Zhou brought out his *pu* for inspection—it was a rat. The merchant of Zheng declined and did not take it.\n\nA father’s commands to his son may be of two kinds: those that must be obeyed and those that cannot be obeyed. To dismiss a favored wife or sell a beloved concubine—these are commands that must be obeyed. Thus, he might say, \"You must harbor no resentment. You must entertain no longing.\" These are commands that cannot be obeyed.\n\nTherefore, those who hold authority over others must be cautious in what they command. Generally, when people are wealthy, they do not covet rank or salary; when they are poor, they do not fear punishment. Those who do not covet rank or salary are self-sufficient. Those who do not fear punishment do not rely on their own preservation. These two conditions are of great concern to the state, yet the means to guard against them are unknown. Thus, commands go unheeded, and prohibitions are not observed. If commands go unheeded and prohibitions are not observed, there can be no governance. Without governance, the ruler merely occupies his position in vain, a nominal lord over his people. Chaos and ruin will swiftly follow.\n\nIf wealth were only attainable through rank and salary, people would surely strive with all their might for their lord. If poverty were only the result of punishment, people would universally fear transgression and follow goodness. Thus, the ancients who governed the state did not allow the people to become rich or poor on their own. When wealth and poverty both depend on the ruler, the ruler holds exclusive control, and the people know to whom they owe their allegiance.\n\nThe poor resent others; the lowly resent their circumstances. Yet none resent themselves—this is the great tendency of human nature. However, one cannot dismiss this as merely the great tendency of human nature and wholly condemn it. There are also those deserving of compassion, which must not be overlooked.\n\nNow, if two men are equal in ability and strength, yet one grows rich while the other remains poor, to bear no resentment would be admirable. Even if resentment arises, it is not without justification. If two men are equal in talent and wisdom, yet one is honored while the other is debased, to bear no resentment would be admirable. Even if resentment arises, it is not without justification. The fault lies in failing to recognize the difference in seizing opportunities and leveraging circumstances, and though their intelligence and ability may be the same, this is the error of those who do not comprehend. Even a gentleman’s frustration in such cases is a righteous anger.\n\nWhen people are poor, they resent others; when they are rich, they become arrogant. Those who resent others do so because they suffer from not receiving bounty, arising from a state of distress they cannot endure—this may be forgiven. But those who are arrogant incur no suffering, yet arrogantly belittle others without cause. This is a flaw that could easily be controlled yet is not—it cannot be forgiven.\n\nThe common people, upon seeing the poor and lowly, treat them with disdain and distance. Upon seeing the rich and noble, they show respect and draw near. If the poor and lowly make requests of them, keeping their distance is acceptable, for it does not necessarily harm them. Yet they must distance themselves, for the poor and lowly possess nothing of value. If the rich and noble bestow favors upon them, drawing near is acceptable, for it does not necessarily benefit them. Yet they must draw near, or the rich and noble will not dare to approach them. These three conditions stand independently, without any basis for closeness or distance. Human nature ultimately cannot help but shift its concerns with poverty and lowliness, wealth and nobility—thus, it is called a great delusion.\n\nThe destitute, solitary, poor, and lowly are objects of shared compassion in well-ordered times and shared contempt in chaotic times. Yet a well-ordered age is not so because it pities the destitute, solitary, poor, and lowly—this is merely one aspect of good governance. A chaotic age is not so because it scorns the destitute, solitary, poor, and lowly—this is merely one aspect of disorder. When every matter is well-governed, there is no chaos; when chaos reigns, there is no order. Observe the prosperity of the Xia and Shang dynasties and their subsequent decline—this is the proof.\n\nThe hopes of the poor and lowly for wealth and nobility are exceedingly modest, yet the wealthy and noble cannot fulfill even these modest hopes. What the rich despise, the poor cherish; what the noble disregard, the lowly honor. Yet they do not reward or grant these things, for they do not share in the same joys and sorrows. Even if they do not reward them, it does no harm to themselves.\n\nNow, the hopes of the common people for their ruler are like those of the poor and lowly for the wealthy and noble. What they hope for is merely this: to care for the young and old, to balance taxes and levies, to provide for their hunger and cold, to tend to their illnesses and pains, to ensure rewards and punishments are not excessive, and to employ them at the proper times. This would cost the ruler nothing. Yet if he does not fulfill these hopes, it is because he does not share in their toil and rest.\n\nTherefore, the ruler must not fail to share in the toil and rest of the people. Thus, the wealthy and noble may not need to reward the poor and lowly, but the ruler cannot fail to reward the common people. If he does not reward the common people, they will not wish to support him. If they do not wish to support him, his position as ruler will be usurped. Nothing is more perilous, no disaster greater.",

Should a latter-day Zhongchang emerge, a definitive edition may yet be established.\n—Inscribed by Xi Zuo\n\n**Original Preface:**\nThe version in the *Complete and Sufficient* Daoist Canon omits the character *zhi* (之), aligning with the *Zhuangzi*’s \"Tianxia\" chapter in meaning. The character *wan* (玩) in the Daoist Canon appears as *shen* (甚). The *Great Dao* above—what the unvirtuous treasure—*Laozi* writes *bao* (宝) as *bao* (保), the two being anciently interchangeable. When power is employed, it reverses into authority. The *Xu Rongzhai Biji* cites it as: \"When power is insufficient, it reverses into authority.\" The saying goes: \"A fine ox,\" and further: \"This cannot but be examined.\" The phrase \"又曰\" (*you yue*, \"furthermore says\") is superfluous and should be deleted, following the *Taiping Yulan* (899), which cites this passage. \"Thus, people measure length\" (故人以度审长短)—the character *gu* (故) is erroneous. The *Qunshu Zhiyao* cites it as *gu yi liang shou* (古以量受, \"anciently measured by capacity\"), while the Daoist Canon inverts the two characters, aligning with the *Zhiyao*. \"To govern confusion\" (以治烦惑)—the Daoist Canon writes *zhi* (治) as *zhi* (制), aligning with the *Zhiyao*. \"All affairs return to the One\" (以万事皆归于一)—the character *yi* (以) is superfluous and should be deleted, following the *Zhiyao*. \"Such are the stubborn, the deaf, and the blind\" (如此顽嚚聋瞽)—the *Zhiyao* cites this passage with the character *ze* (则) below *ru ci* (如此), which can discern the wise and the perceptive. The character *yi* (以) is erroneous; the *Jifu* edition writes *yu* (与), aligning with the *Zhiyao*. \"In governing together\" (同其治也)—the *Zhiyao* cites it as *yi* (矣). \"If one person could master all affairs under heaven\" (设一人能备天下之事)—the *Zhiyao* cites *neng* (能) as *ze* (则), attaching it to the following sentence. \"For farmers, merchants, artisans, and scholars\" (农商工士)—the Daoist Canon writes *shi* (士) as *shi* (仕), and the same below. \"Then what is left for the ruler above?\" (则处上者何事哉)—the *Zhiyao* writes *zhe* (者) as *you junzi fu yan changduan* (有君子弗言长短, \"there are gentlemen who do not speak of length and shortness\"). In the \"Government of the Humble\" chapter of the *Changduan Jing*, *fu* (弗) is written as *bu* (不), aligning with the *Zhiyao*. \"Gentlemen do not engage in debates over length and shortness\" (君子弗为长短经)—here, *fu* (弗) is also written as *bu* (不). Thus, \"the enlightened ruler does not do this\" (故明主不为此)—the two characters *bu wei* (不为) are erroneous and should follow the *Zhiyao* as *ren* (任, \"entrust\"), with the following text: \"Thus, the enlightened ruler punishes them.\" This directly corresponds to the preceding. \"The governance of external matters\" (治外之理)—petty men must speak of abilities beyond their duties. Here, text is missing and should follow the *Zhiyao*: \"The governance of external matters is what petty men must speak of; abilities beyond their duties are what petty men must engage in.\" Observing the following text: \"Petty men also know that speech harms governance yet cannot refrain from speaking; petty men also know that ability harms affairs yet cannot refrain from acting,\" it becomes clear that *yan* (言, \"speech\") is attached to *zhi* (治, \"governance\") and *neng* (能, \"ability\") to *shi* (事, \"affairs\"). \"Petty men also know that speech harms governance\" (小人亦知言损于治)—the *Zhiyao* cites *sun* (损, \"harms\") with the additional character *you* (有, \"there is\") above it, and the same in the following sentence. The ancient saying: \"Not knowing does no harm to the gentleman\" (不知无害于君子)—the *Zhiyao* cites this sentence with the character *gu* (故) at the beginning, and *yu* (于) as *wei* (为) in the following sentence, confirming this. The *Zhiyao* cites it as: \"These words are true indeed.\" \"To do good so others cannot attain it is to practice solitary virtue\" (为善使人不能得从此独善也). \"To craft skillfully so others cannot attain it is to practice solitary skill\" (为巧使人不能得从此独巧也). \"The principles of perfect goodness and skill are not yet exhausted\" (未尽善巧之理)—the *Zhiyao* cites this passage as: \"To do good so others cannot attain it, to craft skillfully so others cannot attain it, is to practice solitary virtue and solitary skill. The principles of perfect skill and goodness are not yet exhausted.\" The commentary on the \"Government of the Humble\" chapter of the *Changduan Jing* includes the character *zhe* (者) below *wei shan* (为善, \"to do good\") and *wei qiao* (为巧, \"to craft skillfully\"), with *zhe* (者) placed below *li* (理, \"principles\"). The rest aligns with the *Zhiyao*, showing that the Tang edition of the *Yinwenzi* was thus. \"What is prized in the sage’s governance\" (所贵圣人之治)—the *Xu Rongzhai Biji* cites this sentence with the character *gu* (故) at the beginning, aligning with the *Zhiyao*. \"Is prized for their ability to govern together with the multitude\" (贵其能与众共治)—the *Changduan Jing* cites *gong zhi* (共治, \"govern together\") with the character *ye* (也) below it, and the two characters *suo gui* (所贵, \"what is prized\") align with the *Zhiyao*. \"The solitary conduct of the worthy\" (独行之贤)—the *Changduan Jing* cites this sentence with the character *fu* (夫) at the beginning. \"The origin of chaos\" (乱之所由生)—the *Changduan Jing* cites this with the character *ye* (也). \"To employ the Dao to level their perils\" (任道以夷其险)—the *Zhiyao* writes *yi* (夷) as *tong* (通, \"unobstruct\"). \"To regulate with the Dao\" (制之有道也)—the \"Adapting to Change\" chapter of the *Changduan Jing* cites it as: \"In regulation, there is the Dao.\" \"All are not my use\" (皆非我用)—the character *yong* (用) is erroneous and should follow the *Zhiyao* as *ye* (也, \"is\"). \"Following what they employ\" (因彼所用)—the character *suo* (所) is erroneous and should follow the *Zhiyao* as *ke* (可, \"can\"). \"And naturally attain their use\" (而自得其用)—the *Zhiyao* cites this with the additional five characters *er zi de qi yong ye* (而自得其用也, \"and naturally attain their use\"). The *Changduan Jing* writes *hu* (乎) as *ye* (也). \"Then why worry about the chaos of things?\" (各奚患物之乱乎).**",
      "overlap_context": "Yet if he does not fulfill these hopes, it is because he does not share in their toil and rest.\n\nTherefore, the ruler must not fail to share in the toil and rest of the people. Thus, the wealthy and noble may not need to reward the poor and lowly, but the ruler cannot fail to reward the common people. If he does not reward the common people, they will not wish to support him. If they do not wish to support him, his position as ruler will be usurped. Nothing is more perilous, no disaster greater.",

      "translated_text": "Where the *Zhiyao* aligns: \"The wise and brave do not overstep\" (智勇者不陵)—the *Zhiyao* writes *ling* (陵) as *jin* (矜, \"self-assured\"), and adds \"fixed within their allotment\" (定于分也). The *Zhiyao* writes *ding* (定) as *zu* (足, \"sufficient\"). \"Thus, hearts all differ\" (故心皆殊)—the *Zhiyao* adds the character *ren* (人, \"people\") below *gu* (故). \"It must be governed to correct them\" (必为治以矫之)—the character *zhi* (治) is erroneous; the *Mingjifu* edition and the *Zang* edition both write it as *fa* (法, \"law\").\n\n\"Food does not differ from flesh\" (食不异肉)—the *Zang* edition writes *yi* (异) as *jian* (兼, \"to combine\"). The *Yulan* (689) cites this passage, and the *Shuchao* (143) writes it as \"to value people\" (重人), adding: \"All wear coarse cloth\" (皆大布之衣). Both the *Shuchao* and *Yulan* include the character *guo* (国, \"state\") above *ren* (人), which is omitted here.\n\nThe *Shuchao* (116) cites the line on King Goujian of Yue plotting revenge against Wu as: \"King Goujian, intending to avenge Wu, bowed to them\" (越王将报吴王而轼之). The *Shuchao* (85) and *Yulan* (543) both cite it as: \"Upon descending his chariot, he bowed\" (下车而揖之). The *Shuchao* (116) also writes it as: \"Turned his chariot to avoid them\" (回车避之). \"Within several years, the people—regardless of age—faced the enemy without shirking even boiling water or fire\" (比及数年民无长幼临敌虽汤火不避)—the *Shuchao* (116) cites it as: \"Later, in battle, the people did not avoid boiling water or fire\" (后战民皆不避汤火). This differs from the present text.\n\n\"Knowing how easily human sentiments shift\" (知人情之易动)—the *Zang* edition writes *ren* (人) as *min* (民, \"the common people\"). \"Though occupying a position of fame and rank, even the unworthy and foolish do not distance themselves from things\" (处名位虽不肖下愚物不疏己)—this passage is corrupt and missing text. The *Wenxuan* commentary on Ren Yansheng’s *Memorial in Recommendation of a Scholar* cites it as: \"Though occupying a position of fame and rank, even the unworthy do not worry that things will not draw near to them; in poverty and lowliness, they do not worry that things will distance themselves\" (处名位虽不肖不患物不亲己在贫贱不患物不疏己). Observing the following text—\"closeness and distance hinge on power and profit\" (亲疏系乎势利)—this passage should also address both closeness and distance. The character *xia yu* (下愚, \"foolish\") is an error; its form resembles *bu huan* (不患, \"do not worry\"). The *Zang* edition writes *xia* (下) as *bu* (不).\n\n\"That which has not yet wholly vanished does not depend on the unworthy or the humane and worthy\" (此其之未尽泯者不系于不肖与仁贤)—the *Wenxuan* commentary includes the character *ye* (也) here.\n\n\"To assess merit and demote or promote\" (君科功黜陟)—the *Zang* edition writes *ke* (科) as *liao* (料, \"to evaluate\"). The character *liao* (料) is also used below: \"to evaluate the young and old\" (料长幼). \"This is the virtue of a humane ruler, who may serve as lord\" (此仁君之德可以为主矣)—the *Xunzi* *Zheng Lun* commentary cites *ren* (仁) as *ren* (人, \"a ruler\") and *zhu* (主) as *wang* (王, \"king\"). The *Yulan* (389) cites it as: \"King Xuan of Qi\" (齐宣王). The *Lüshi Chunqiu* *Yong Se* chapter aligns, stating: \"In truth, what he used did not exceed three *dan*\" (其实所用不过三石). The *Shuchao* (125) and *Yulan* (389) both include the character *gong* (弓, \"bow\") below *yong* (用). This passage omits: \"All said it was no less than nine *dan*\" (皆曰不下九石). The *Shuchao* and *Yulan* both include the character *ci* (此) below *yue* (曰). \"And for his entire life, he believed it to be nine *dan*\" (而终身自以为九石)—the *Yulan* includes the character *yong* (用) below *wei* (为). \"And in the whole state, none dared to compete\" (而一国无聘者)—the *Yiwen Leiju* (18) cites it as: \"And in the whole state, none dared to compete\" (而一国之人无敢聘者). The *Yulan* (381) also includes the character *gan* (敢). \"In Wei, there was a widower\" (卫有鳏夫)—below *guan fu* (鳏夫), the character *shi* (失) is missing and should be supplemented following the *Yulan*.\n\n\"A traveler asked: 'What bird is this?'\" (路人问何鸟也)—the *Yulan* (917) includes the character *yue* (曰) below *wen* (问). Here, the character *zhi* (直) is written directly, but it is erroneous. The *Yiwen Leiju* (90) and *Yulan* (917) both write it as *shi* (始, \"at first\"): \"Then he said...\" (然则). \"Ten pieces of gold\" (十金)—the *Yiwen Leiju* and *Yulan* both write it as: \"Requested to buy for ten pieces of gold\" (请买十金). \"The traveler did not hesitate to value the gold\" (路人不遑惜金)—the *Yiwen Leiju* includes the character *qi* (其) below *xi* (惜). He said: \"It is a strange stone\" (谓之曰怪石也)—the *Yiwen Leiju* (83) and *Yulan* (805) both write *wei* (谓) as *zha* (诈, \"to deceive\"). Both the *Mingjifu* edition and the *Zang* edition include the character *ci* (此) below *yue* (曰), which is omitted here.\n\n\"It is not worth even one *fu*\" (弗如一复之)—the character *zhi* (之) is superfluous and should be deleted following the *Mingjifu* edition and the *Zang* edition. \"The farmer called his household and was greatly alarmed\" (田父称家大怖)—the character *cheng* (称) is erroneous. The *Yulan* cites it as *qi* (其, \"his\"). \"Thereupon, he hastily cast it into the distant wilds\" (于是遽而弃于远野)—the *Yulan* includes the character *zhi* (之) below *qi* (弃). \"Bowed twice and stood, daring to congratulate: 'Your Majesty has obtained this treasure of the world'\" (再拜而立敢贺曰王得此天下之宝)—this passage is corrupt. The *Yulan* writes it as: \"Bowed twice, stepped back, and stood, daring to congratulate: 'Great King, you have obtained this treasure of the world'\" (再拜却立曰敢贺大王得此天下之宝). The *Liutie* (7) aligns. The *Yiwen Leiju* writes it as: \"Bowed twice and congratulated: 'Great King, you have obtained this treasure of the world'\" (再拜贺曰大王得此天下之宝). This likely abbreviates the text.\n\n\"King Wen asked the price\" (王问价)—the *Mingjifu* edition and the *Zang* edition both include the character *qi* (其) below *wen* (问), aligning with the *Yiwen Leiju* citation. \"The salary of an upper grandee\" (食上大夫禄)—the *Yiwen Leiju* includes the character *zhi* (之) below *da fu* (大夫).\n\nWhere the *Zhiyao* aligns: \"The Great Dao\" (大道)—the *Zhiyao* writes it as the \"Sage\" chapter (圣人篇). \"The means by which to conduct oneself with reverence\" (所以行恭谨)—the *Zhiyao* cites it as *jin jing* (谨敬, \"reverent respect\"). The *Changduan Jing* *Fan Jing* chapter writes it as *jing jin* (敬谨, \"respectful reverence\"). \"This is also how to violate proper roles\" (亦所以乖名分)—the *Zhiyao* and *Changduan Jing* both write it as: \"This is also how to generate violations of proper roles\" (亦所以生乖分). \"Not to flee of one’s own accord from the court of Jie and Zhou\" (非自逃于桀纣之朝)—the character *zi* (自) in *Zhiyao* is written as *gu* (故, \"thus\"). \"Lose the Dao, and the world falls into chaos\" (失其道则天下乱)—the *Zhiyao* includes the character *yong* (用) above *shi* (失). \"To bind the myriad beings\" (笼络万品)—the *Zhiyao* writes *long* (笼) as *chan* (缠, \"to entangle\"). \"In a state of disorder\" (有乱国)—the *Zhiyao* cites this line under \"a state in decline\" (衰国), aligning with the following text.\n\n\"The lord is aged and has many concubines\" (君年长多媵)—the *Changduan Jing* *Li Luan* chapter includes the character *qie* (妾, \"concubine\") below *duo* (多), aligning with the *Zhiyao*. The *Mingjifu* edition writes it as *ying qie* (媵妾, \"concubines\"). \"To alienate the clan\" (疏宗族)—the *Mingjifu* edition and the *Zang* edition both write *zu* (族) as *qiang* (强, \"powerful\"), aligning with the *Zhiyao*. \"Not awaiting the arrival of cruelty and violence\" (不待凶恶残暴)—the *Zhiyao* writes *e* (恶) as *nüe* (虐, \"tyranny\"), aligning with the preceding text.\n\n\"The branches and descendants multiply\" (支庶繁)—the *Changduan Jing* writes *fan* (繁) as *xi* (息, \"to grow\"), aligning with the *Zhiyao*. \"The superiors cannot overcome their subordinates\" (上不胜其下)—\"The subordinates do not offend their superiors\" (下不犯其上). The *Changduan Jing* includes the character *neng* (能, \"can\") below both *bu* (不) characters, aligning with the *Zhiyao*. The *Zang* edition also includes *neng* (能) in the latter line.\n\n\"Who says it is perplexing?\" (孰曰荧惑)—the character *yue* (曰) is erroneous and should be written as *neng* (能) following the *Mingjifu* edition. \"To receive it in speech and action before others\" (承之于言行之先)—below this, 124 characters are missing and should be supplemented following the *Zhiyao*: \"The common people of the world rejoice at praise and grieve at blame—this is the great sentiment of the multitude. Those who share their views are pleased; those who differ are angered—this is the great sentiment of people. Thus, flatterers are skilled at praising and adept at compliance. They affirm what others affirm and deny what others deny, follow what others love and align with what others detest. Therefore, though a wise lord may accept the upright, he does not necessarily befriend them; though he may distance flatterers, he does not necessarily alienate them. Thus, Shun and Yu, though able to reject flatterers, did not necessarily detest them. As the saying goes: 'Flattery and sophistry confuse things'—even Shun and Yu could not come to detest them.

      "translated_text": "Examining the final particle *hu* (乎), it should read *ye* (也). In governing the state, *Laozi* uses *zheng* (政) and *zheng* (正) interchangeably as anciently accepted. How can one govern through fear of death? *Zhiyao* cites it as: \"How can one govern them through fear of death?\" The *Shaozi* states: *Ou Ming*. The *Jifu* edition reads *ou* (殴) below, identically. Yet *Taiping Yulan* 405 cites it as: \"One responds with truth.\" The characters *bin ke wang fu* (宾客往复) are mistakenly inverted; they should follow the *Mingji* and *Jifu* editions, transposed as *fu wang* (复往). *Yiwen Leiju* 94, *Taiping Yulan* 405, and 905 all cite it as *fu wang* (复往). The people of Zheng call unworked jade *pu* (璞). The *Hou Hanshu* commentary by Ying Shao reads *li* (理) as *zhuo* (琢). To the Zheng merchant, it is said in *Yiwen Leiju* 83: \"It is asked...\" The text above this is missing 116 characters, which should be supplemented according to *Zhiyao* as follows:\n\nTianzi said: \"People all act for themselves and cannot act for others. Therefore, one who rules others employs them to act for themselves, not to act for his own use.\" Mr. Wei below remarked: \"Excellent indeed are Tianzi’s words! In ancient times, when a ruler employed his ministers, he sought not private affection for himself but manifest loyalty to himself. Thus, those who held office were necessarily capable, and those who faced battle were necessarily brave. Encouraged by emoluments and rewards, aligned by fame and law, their actions did not arise from their own hearts nor profit their own persons.\" As the saying goes: \"One with meager emoluments cannot be entrusted with enduring chaos; one with paltry rewards cannot be entrusted with facing peril.\" These are matters the superior must carefully consider.\n\n[Note: The passage beginning \"One with meager emoluments...\" is also found in *Yilin* and *Taiping Yulan* 633, which states: \"Such commands will certainly not be carried out.\"] *Changduan Jing*, in the \"Governance and Institutions\" chapter, includes the character *shang* (上) here, stating: \"One must be cautious about what one commands.\" *Changduan Jing* renders it as: \"One must be cautious about the commands one issues.\" *Zhiyao* also includes the character *yan* (焉). Though it is said that the wise and capable are alike, the character *sui* (虽) is mistaken and should follow the *Mingji* and *Jifu* editions, reading *wei* (惟). The arrogant know no suffering. *Zhiyao* omits the character *xia* (下) but includes *suo* (所). It is like the poor and lowly longing for wealth and nobility. *Zhiyao* includes the character *zhe* (者) after *pin jian* (贫贱). Thus, the wealthy and noble cannot but requite the poor and lowly. *Zhiyao* cites it as connecting to the following sentence. *Yiwen* records: *Yinwenzi* saw King Xuan of Qi.",
