  "full_translation": "**The Collected Works of Master Wu Zhai**\n\n**Title:** *The Collected Works of Master Wu Zhai*\n**Author:** Yang Zhizhi of the Southern Song, in two juan.\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Taiping Section.\n\n---\n\n### *The Collected Works of Master Wu Zhai, Volume One*\n\n**Preface to the Memorial of Gratitude to Director Chen for the Purification Fast at the Taiyi Palace**\n*Composed by Yang Zhizhi, Imperial Bestowed Eminent Scholar, Right Illustrious Exemplar of Righteousness, Supervisor of the Teachings of the Daoist Clergy, and Abbot of Hezao Mountain*\n\nThe mist of Mao Cave runs deep, where I clutch the axe of mountain-dwelling; the bamboo palace nears the heavens, when suddenly arrives the summons to the imperial precinct. My name, mistakenly heard among the capped and gowned, my rank, prematurely placed before the black-robed and brown. Yet I reflect: the Taiyi Shrine is sacred, its deity most noble; the star of Shaowei shines bright, whence comes the title of Eminent Scholar.\n\nDuring the reigns of Jian, Shao, Qian, and Chun, many were the recluses like Chao and You, the ministers like Yuan and Qi. Summoned to the imperial court, they discoursed on scriptures and expounded the Dao; sent forth beyond the world, they were granted titles and bestowed texts. In recent years, such practices have all but ceased.\n\nWhy? Those who tread the byways and rush in outnumber those carried by carts or measured by the bushel. With a single sweep, common steeds vanish—all marvel at Your Excellency’s decisive judgment. With but a few lines, the resplendent phoenix descends—perhaps a worthy one may yet come. As for myself, I am utterly ordinary, clinging to solitude and purity. My habits, by chance, follow brush and ink; my traces wander rivers and lakes. The famous mountains and great rivers I have visited, I have taken in; the elders and predecessors I have met, I have followed. At times, I built a hut to gather books, resting in shade to still my shadow. Mistakenly appointed as a leader among the mist and clouds, I am startled by the passing years—twenty of them. I have not entered the gates of the capital, yet I have preserved this Way; the five thousand words I have bound and set on the high shelf, yet this culture has not perished.\n\nThen came the decree, descending from heaven, bidding me to offer my strength and take my place. In the quiet of night, by the rush-light’s glow, I swept away the dust of years from my mat. Unlike the men of Song, who borrowed the sun’s vessel to separate the fragrant from the foul, I am like Master Cui of old. Some may doubt the coexistence of tiger and rat within the same palace, yet I strive to cultivate literature and assist the teachings.\n\nIf I may offer the slightest merit, I shall return all glory to the throne, perhaps fulfilling my long-held aspiration. Yet I remain ashamed of my crude learning, unworthy of such boundless grace.\n\nThis is all thanks to Your Excellency’s noble nature, your person embodying warmth and reverence. The sacred scriptures and worthy traditions you have gathered like a sea of jade within your breast; your brilliant phrases and luminous words bloom like brocade from your brush. Your calligraphy and painting attain the subtlety of Zhong and Wang; your discourse pierces the mysteries of Lao and Śākya. In leisure, you wander gardens and ponds; when guests arrive, you entertain with poetry and wine. Such exceptional talent you delight in recognizing.\n\nI am deeply moved, my late years stirred to fervor. I gaze upward to wish the Sage long life, ever beholding the grandeur of the Grand Marshal. Ten petitions I seal in my bag, emulating Zhong Fangping’s devotion to his lord; three letters I carry in my sleeve, still hoping to ascend Mount Song. Slightly set apart from the common crowd, I receive instruction from this extraordinary favor.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial of Gratitude for Demotion in Rank to Vice Minister, Presented to the Chancellor**\n\nMy conduct was irreverent behind the screen, my breach of decorum before the ninefold steps. Impeachment deemed me worthy of demotion by one rank. Yet by the emperor’s boundless mercy, the court’s lenient decree, I was spared punishment—grateful, yet ashamed.\n\nMy nature is obscured by dust, my path lost in the sea of learning. Half my life I toiled in humble cloth; in office, I usurped the shade of the gentry. My father taught me loyalty; I barely upheld his teachings at the courtyard gate. In serving my lord, I spoke without reserve, ever cherishing my devotion to the throne.\n\nSince receiving the imperial writ, I have striven to maintain purity like ice and yeast. Appointed to oversee military provisions in Huzhou, I barely met the demands; serving as vice-prefect in Lanzhou, I endured the hardships of governance. Repeatedly recommended, I was burdened by the weight of imperial favor. Sent south with the insignia of office, I raised my gaze to the peaceful steps of the throne, inquiring after the people’s hardships—how could I compose poetry and song?\n\nBy the might of the state, I was fortunate to witness bountiful harvests and few affairs. Like a jade vessel preserved from minor flaws, I cherished my sustenance in Chang’an. Yet standing behind the imperial screen, as I presented my memorials, my tablet slipped from my grasp, and I lost all courtly decorum. It was not that heaven turned from my face, but as if some force tugged at my elbow.\n\nShattered teeth I stooped to gather—how dare I aspire to the lofty conduct of my predecessors? Leaning on my cheek, I wandered in contemplation, vainly admiring the crisp air of the Western Hills. The shame of the scholar’s green robe cannot be hidden; the punishment of the firewood gatherer cannot be escaped. Bearing the thorns, I return; on a straw mat, I await my fate.\n\nYet your judgment is rooted in loyalty and magnanimity. Though my name was stricken from the rolls, I was spared the ultimate penalty. Even the lowly, like the belly and navel, retain their form within the vast expanse. I reflect on my own head and limbs, knowing my kin await my return.\n\nThis is all thanks to Your Excellency, who unites virtue to receive heaven’s favor, emulating the Three Kings in governance. Unmoved by sound or color, you perfect the essence of loyal devotion; your fame and virtue stand peerless, preserving the relics of antiquity. At the feast in the profound hall, I humbly presented my modest proposal. Preserving this humble existence, you truly tempered the punishment.\n\nHow dare I not engrave your great virtue in my heart, caution myself against past errors, and cultivate myself with greater fear and diligence, striving to act in accordance with ritual? Though I withdraw my tablet and retire, I trust the Chancellor’s leisure will not forget this age’s debt to me. Should I one day present the jade tablet and be received in audience, perhaps my service may yet endure. My gratitude is boundless, yet words fail to express it.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial of Congratulation on the Chancellor’s Appointment as Grand Tutor**\n\nWith reverence, I learn that the imperial decree has honored the great court, rewarding merit by the true arbiter. The emperor, joyful, serves the Empress Dowager, bestowing the title of Grand Tutor with jade tablets. You, who harmonize governance like the ancient ministers, now rightfully occupy the foremost seat among the three dukes. The splendor of this ritual brings joy to all officials.\n\nThis is all thanks to Your Excellency, the pillar of state, whose foresight rivals the tortoise and milfoil. For five hundred years, the mountains and seas have nurtured your spirit; for twenty years, you have presided over the court. With majestic presence, you pacify the realm without a change in countenance; in binding Huai and capturing Cai, you restored the Central Plains through concerted effort. Your refined governance began at the southern suburbs; your blessings, bestowed by the Queen Mother, have now arrived. The gentry gather to praise you, inscribing your deeds in jade and stone.\n\nAs the imperial procession gathers at court, you lead the grandeur of the royal rites...\n\nThe imperial rescript issues forth, elevating you to the exalted rank of Grand Tutor. Fields of fertile soil and lush pastures flourish in tandem, while the dignity of your carriage and mien grows ever more resplendent. Seated, you discourse upon the Dao; in audience, your name is not called. You stand as the singular classic of Song, a sage-king matched with a worthy minister; you tread the fourfold bounds of Qi, awaiting the true king from a different lineage.\n\nI, entrusted to the great turning of the cosmos, toil in this humble post, clutching the imperial edict in hand, longing to dance in reverence, yet gazing upon your crimson slippers, I find no path to approach. I stockpile hay and grain, preparing for the bandits of Yanchi; I craft pickled plums and brew yeast, ever to share the gaze of cliffs and stones. Alongside Commander Xie of Jingdeguan and Metropolitan Prefect Zhao Jiezhai—who, returning to seek chrysanthemums and wolfberries, sought a life of leisure, tending lakes and mountains, and now oversees the secret precincts—though the grand office may harbor intentions of summoning you, I fear the ancients would question the sincerity of such a call.\n\nI privately reflect: an abbey is defined by the Dao, and its renown grows with the person. Zhi Zhang’s learning began with the misty waves of *Jianqu*; Qinglao’s poetry sustained the incense fires of Jinling. Yet those who merely clutch wine jars and rice sacks bring only shame to the bells and porridge of the monastery.\n\nI, humbly, bear the remnants of a bookish folly, my sword’s qi yet unspent. A single ravine suffices to secure my late years; twice have I returned to my old nest after ten fasts. Lacking the missive of Song Gao’s pacification of bandits, I idly speak of journeying to court—yet without the raincoat’s divine art, how dare I hope for a palace to be built? Fragments of my writings have been repeatedly sent to the throne; my crumbling house and dilapidated walls remain as transient lodgings.\n\nYou, with a pure heart, take pity on this guest. The officials report a vacancy in Jingde, and your esteemed decree arrives with strings of cash and measures of grain, appointing a recluse as registrar. Some argue that beneath the towering trees, even orioles become disciples of the Son of Heaven—why cast aside a colt for its youth? Yet Hongjing dwelt in the mountains, building three separate lodges; Yaofu resided in Luoyang, establishing ten wandering retreats, ensuring scholars had a place to turn and elders could share in warmth and intimacy.\n\nAs for those who witness white cranes surveying the forests of Linwu or tuck blue serpents into their sleeves to soar past Dongting—how can such marvels be constrained? For Jiezhai, a single outing would not be amiss; for Xiang Chang, a solitary stroll along the long embankment would suffice.\n\nYou, resplendent as the finest scion of the Han, magnanimous as the Prefect of the Capital, fill the gaps in the imperial robes with your brush and ink, while even the smallest matters of firewood and rice win the joy of the city’s people. Leading small processions in spring, you rectify the sunrise at Xinting; inquiring after the immortal of the slopes, you gather Jingbai in one hall, summoning Mímíng to join you. You oversee the two sons of Hou and Liu, and though the Mountain Judge resists entreaties, the imperial voice grants special permission for free passage.\n\nHow dare I not compose verses on plum blossoms with renewed vigor, or plant willows in abundance? For dozens of miles, all is water, cleansing the worldly dust from seated guests. Three hundred years hence, someone shall add this to the new records of *Huangtu*. Respectfully, Military Commissioner Xie Guixin petitions to reside at Yulong.\n\nAmid the two streets’ imperial compositions, I humbly bask in the radiance of your flowering staff; across ten states’ talismanic decrees, you govern the multitudes beneath brocade canopies. Overflowing honors crown my modest petitions, while the solemnity of your retreat lends grandeur to the scene. To speak of the Daoist great mountains—none surpass the former abode of Jingyang. Where caps and robes gather, leadership must fall to the worthy. Passersby drool with envy, buying glib tongues with idle chatter; followers dip their fingers in, heedless of the common treasury’s pearls. Such men belittle themselves—our Way nearly collapses.\n\nI recall my own drifting upon rivers and lakes, as stubborn as wood and stone, unable to consume Shang Hao’s mushrooms, yet ever guarding Master Xu’s cypress. When the marshal deigned to visit, I was counted among his peers, vying for seats with ease, recognizing faces in the mountains. Repeatedly I dreamed of Tianbao’s jade cliffs, offering my scalp to the court, mistakenly joining the rites at Ganquan’s grand altars. Through inner jiao rites I presented poems, shamed by imperial favor that brushed my pen; though admonished with instruction, I was not permitted to return. Gazing toward Governor Yan’s chariot canopy, I felt unworthy of such plain ignorance; when the couch for the reclusive Master Xu was set, glad tidings suddenly arrived. Though I longed for both bear’s paws and fish, I could not have both—apes and cranes grew alarmed, then resentful.\n\nNow I prostrate myself before one whose name shines like sun and moon, whose might shakes wind and frost. You sought the Six-One Elder’s home on Longgang, advancing the finest of the prefecture; you founded the academy of Twenty Scholars on Egret Isle, cultivating talent. Recommending transfers of jade-tasseled green silk insignia, you jointly oversaw the splendor of painted beams and vermilion curtains. Unrolling maps to inquire of customs, you truly lifted entire households to immortality. I have heard that this flourishing realm has long lacked a master for its devotions. While crows and rats squabble before my eyes, which lone crane or proud rooster will win the people’s hearts? To the left, Fuqiu; to the right, Hongya—hearing a hundred times cannot match one glimpse. Near Huangfu, far from Bai Juyi—three divinations follow two affirmations.\n\nWhat virtue do I possess to deserve this, unasked? My worth does not rival that of Shaoshi, nor can I escape Chang’an’s confines. Abandoning my own affairs to serve your halls, I renew the vow to follow you one day. Racing through frosty skies to gather persimmons and chestnuts, I chant empty verses of last night’s dream of my mother—though the mulberry and elm are late, peach and plum may yet flourish.\n\n**Petition of Xie, Military Commissioner, declining residence at Yulong and requesting leave:**\nHaving received permission to withdraw, I briefly step from the ranks of the Flowery Palace, leading the assembly in cultivation, humbled by the Star Terrace’s command. Stricken by illness during the delayed season, I submitted a memorial to seek leisure. The imperial voice has not yet assented; how can I answer the cauldron’s words? Gazing back at the blessed land of your tented governance, I wonder if the empty seat’s tenure was granted too lightly—could the immortal’s spirit in heaven be idly toying with its seal? Yet the great prefect’s wisdom shines like the sun, not hastily demeaning others, dispelling the bone-gnawing strife of suspicion. Awaiting the horned one’s emergence as a qilin, public opinion is truly convinced, though it cost exhaustive search.\n\nAs for one like me, weary of rivers and lakes and content to rest, gladly rotting with grass and trees—three years away from court, I mistakenly enjoyed the honor of summons; ten years dwelling in mountains, I laugh at my own shallow schemes. With a forthright heart I detest evil, merely washing my hands to serve the public. Though my purse is stingy, my doorstep is crowded with shoes. The former envoy overpraised me; what talent does the present lord see? Dispatching letters by post, you showed the military officers the joy of open gates; sending word along the prefectural roads, you moved the governor to urge my journey. Yet my reputation still lingers near the emperor’s side—I fear my duties cannot match the theater below. Twice summoned, I did not rise, unlike the hermit of Shaoshi; though one couch hangs empty, surely a recluse from the southern prefectures will appear. May you justly weigh the selection, renewing the sounds of bells and drums.\n\nNow I meet one who is the Confucians’ paragon, a true prime minister’s vessel, fit to ride in light carriages to inquire of customs, swiftly planting banners to govern the people. Your orders in the thorn enclosure stir no murmurs from warring ants; your hand on the iron pillar achieves great feats in slaying dragons. Gazing afar at the lush shade of wellside cypresses, I lament the desolation of incense and flowers. Who shall be master? Consult the people. Forgetting the dignity of tiger tallies and dragon seals, you bestow the courtesies of crane robes and deer caps.\n\nI, pitiful in my meager fate, have failed to live up to your noble intentions. My black bamboo hat veils the clouds, blocking visits to Hongya’s old haunts; my vermilion curtains roll back the rain, still joining the excursions to Pavilion of the Prince of Teng. If you depart suddenly, I shall retreat and listen.\n\n**Petition of Prefectural Governor Pan, Minister of Revenue, reducing grain levies:**\nWith black silk cords I pay respects to the prefecture, daring to bask in the glory of the herb-selling immortal; with white rice I deliver to the granary, specially reducing the grain levies. Distinguishing blessed lands and grotto heavens, I cause the bells of fasts and drums of porridge to resound together. One meal reminds me of your kindness; two altars share in longevity.\n\nExamining the registers of land granted to the Black and Red, I find errors from the Shaoxing land surveys. Southern slopes are yang, northern slopes yin—fertile fields all belong to the wealthy; high ground does not drought, low ground does not flood—abundant years barely suffice for the common halls. When the temple documents arrive, the food rosters swell. As the court first implements the grain storage decree, officials vie to wield harsh authority. Defying the repeated sagely edicts, they refuse to remit taxes, imposing equal burdens on the three counties’ registered households. Snatching wealth like meat, selecting grains like pearls, they force the fields and villages to groan, heedless of the hunger in mountain forests.\n\nI, unworthily holding office, should rotate my food allotment. Moved by the people’s clamor, my heart stirs with sorrow. Lacking ghostly soldiers to transport grain, I truly fear the county magistrate’s ruin. Hoping children will welcome the fine lord by clearing the roads, I first secure lodging at the Purple Horse’s station. Seeing the elder enter the city, I mount a green mule, risking a thousand foolish words to delight in reducing the levies by thirty percent. Dispatching documents to the Yu family, it resembles Lu Su’s grain loan; bestowing favor on the mountain recluse, it costs no effort like Yan Zhenqing’s calligraphy. Though my means are narrow, my words know no bounds.\n\nNow I reverently meet one whose brilliance emerges from the earth’s foundation, whose prestige towers like the sky’s ridgepole—a single commission sets your oars in Qutang; ten years you tread the boots of literary stone.\n\nIn a dwelling like a palace of water-crystal, I follow my own inclinations, free from the clamor of official dispatches at Guangfan Gate, moving only when I choose to move. Yet now I split the Han tally and journey far to Xiao’s shores. At fifty, I thought to remain in this land, but the annual grain levy of a hundred thousand measures far exceeds that of other prefectures. Casting the people into the inner moat, I cannot redress the failures of my predecessors. With sacred mountains within our borders, I must ensure the multitude’s peace through recruitment and conscription, demonstrating the intent to shoulder their burdens in their stead.\n\nHow could I not wield the ladle’s handle with care, still divining by lamp’s flame? A grain of rice leaves me gaunt, a bamboo hat already pities me like Du Fu; lacking wine in spring, lying abed, I think even more of Hong Ya. Forgetting my present post, I dare to cast my gaze toward Shu.\n\nI thank the magistrate of Jurong for decisively cutting down the thieves who plundered the cypresses. A thousand trees stood in the mountains, their felling strictly forbidden; the palace walls rose several yards high, yet thieves still crept in. The axe marks resembled those on Qianling’s tomb, and official business was thus entangled in the inner chambers. Punishment was meted out without mercy—how boundless your virtue!\n\nI recall the Queen Mother’s peaches, tasted thrice by the Son of Heaven; when Dong Jun’s apricots ripened, tigers emerged fourfold to devour men. The transformations of immortals are not so easily stolen, yet bandits and thieves cannot be avoided—how much less so for the raft-dweller on the sea, whose vessel may trespass the Dipper and Ox; or the cassia in the moon, whose felling still startles the toad and hare. An official transplanted the willows west of Wuchang Gate; a child carried away the thatch from Du Ling’s roof. Who lacks the six roots? Heaven itself has five thieves.\n\nReflecting on my own meager talents, ill-suited for tangled affairs, I have tended to cypress and cedar, swept the paths of fir and pine, and long cultivated the fire-jujubes and exchange-pears. Coming from the Three Maos of Juqu, I planned to plant a thousand trees in Xuandu. Beneath the moon, cranes sang among the pines on the peak; by the stream’s echo, no one remained—suddenly, the cypress before the courtyard was lost. Though unlike the forty-span tree that dripped rain, I had hoped it would endure eight thousand autumns. Unable to bear the rats’ depredations, I turned to the Daoist priests for incitement.\n\nCareless storage invites theft—though the cave’s gate had no lock, all was sent to the authorities, and the thieves were swiftly imprisoned. Without concealment, their confessions were thoroughly examined. Fortunately, the axes had not yet rotted, and half the trees remained in the moat’s ruins. Seeing a pig in the rain was auspicious, easing the neighbors’ clamor; bearing the cangue to erase their ears was ominous, yet they were spared the flogging of the marketplace. The mountain bandits shivered by the roadside; the tree spirits rejoiced south of the city. Had the worthy magistrate not pitied the sound of chopping, the unruly mob would have felled them day after day.\n\nNow I reverently meet one whose name graces the immortal registers, whose home lies near the banners of the forest. Your lineage, like the three sophoras, stands ready to bear the sky as pillars; your aspirations, like the five willows, bloom across the county. You cherish talent even in the smallest sapling, fearing the mountains and forests might harbor the shame of a Tong Dian. Dismembering these wall-piercing rats is more ingenious than the bean-eating chickens—let alone ascending to immortality atop the cypress. It is enough to make the people of Tongxiang love me.\n\nI, clinging to the tree like a fool, feel shame at gathering beans, hoping to fully clear the hedges, dreading only the increasing threat of the blade. Summoning the thief-handlers to call up five hundred men, I have already [lacuna] the grace of the capital; emulating the recluse who flogged the Qiang, I still rouse the courage of Mount Song. Better to govern oneself than to speak at length.\n\nI thank the county magistrate for sparing the tomb’s camphor trees. The tomb’s trees have grown thick, and all descendants share the sorrow of frost and dew. When Master Carpenter Shi passed by, the magistrate spared them the axe’s calamity. The clan wept in gratitude; even passersby sighed in praise.\n\nI have heard that a magistrate governs the people of a county, often boasting of his peaches and plums. Who lacks ancestors in the Nine Springs? One must carefully protect the pines and catalpas. Thus, the law forbids trampling the heart of the tomb or pacing its bounds; ritual warns against felling trees to build a chamber. Gazing upon my cold clan, dwelling beside the ancestral graves, the sacrifices at the tomb’s edge are conducted in proper attire, a tradition passed down for generations.\n\nBy the river’s edge stands a tree, its shape like a carriage canopy, ten spans in girth. The geomancers say its shade brings benefit; the younger generation hopes for success in the examinations. But my foolish brother, gambling with dice, brought no profit, leading greedy brokers to offer the trees to the authorities. Though the owner is gone, the deed remains—a white contract of twenty-seven years.\n\nThe spirits come and go unseen, delivering tens of thousands in bronze as tribute. How unbearable the fraud of carving wood to forge documents—all to spare the ancient camphor at the cost of a life. The pines, revived by cinnabar, might as well carry Lü Dongbin’s ink basket. The lychee trees, preserved by the old woman, still bear the sword marks of Huang Chao.\n\nHere, I humbly encounter one whose heroic standards tower over the ravines, whose steadfast strength upholds the heavens. The hall’s beams await the right timber; the mountain town’s zithers seek the aura of treasure. Firewood is sold in the market, dust gathers in the cooking pot—never mingling with the common folk. The great wind howls, battering the heavy gates; how can the masses be made to see?\n\nThus, I sought a mighty *jia* tree, erecting it in lofty splendor, renewing the spectacle for ten thousand eyes—how could I begrudge the expense of a thousand gold? The walls of this pavilion may serve for offerings, for none escape the vigilance of Huang Ba’s spirit. My son, like a tiger, has perished—he will not falter in the might of Mount Tai. The peach trees, though planted, remain untouched; the cassia, though hewn, bears no scar.\n\nIf not for one who tends the household, who would bestow such blessings? Certain vines and creepers stir in dreams, their roots knowing their origin. I think of the Duke of Shao beneath the sweet pear’s shade—how dare I forget his legacy of uncut grace? Beneath the withered tree, a Daoist is painted; deep roots may yet secure long life.\n\nI, a humble clerk, dined at the governor’s table, returning home late. Forced to preside over banquets, how could I endure the burden? Holding the prefectural decree, I sensed the approach of duty; stepping into the courtyard, I offered my thanks.\n\nI have heard that mountains and rivers gain weight by the people who dwell there, that bells and drums rise and fall with the times. Behold Zhang and Ge’s twin altars, recorded as blessed lands of the realm; Chen and Huang, two scholars, ranked among the Daoist officials of the Zhenghe era. Predecessors and successors alike led with virtue, their inner and outer designs complete.\n\nYet how the present age diverges from those of old! The wickedness of the stubborn and foolish floods the heavens; the wind of purity and stillness is swept away. Autumn fields yield no grain, leaving the midday steamer to gather dust. Daoist hats and alms bowls fill the air, yet officials gape like fledglings awaiting food. Though plows and hoes receive rain, farmers must beg for grain to sustain their work. Granary taxes remain half-unpaid, while county levies are collected in advance. Debts pile like mountains, deep-rooted corruption festers. Only those of keen insight and resolve can manage the searing trials above and below.\n\nAs for me—my nature is meager, my learning unremarkable. I wandered aimlessly in the four directions, occasionally keeping company with elders. Leaning on my staff, I explored the caves of Guilin; pushing aside the reeds, I read the stele by the Wu River. In the eighth month, I watched the tide, often leaning on the riverside tower. At midnight, I drafted dispatches against the northern foe. I visited the shrine of the Sea God at Hailing, drank at the tomb of the Banished Immortal at Caishi. Riding a donkey, I sought the old man Zhao; summoning cranes, I paid homage to West Mountain. Ascending the clear waters of the Yu, I climbed the solitary peak; scaling Red City, I gazed upon the cypress and cedar. My boat drifted on Mirror Lake’s moonlit waves; my cup floated on the winding stream’s current.\n\nLying in bed, I reflected on my life—my tracks have circled the realm. Returning to my old retreat, my hut now stands at the clouds’ edge. Official documents fill the shelves; elixir herbs line the walls. Content to grow old here, I seek nothing more.\n\nI know that cassia halls and bamboo palaces stand tall near the imperial city, that stone altars and flowered courtyards dot the land of robes and sashes. Since heaven harbors no foolish immortals, why should the world tolerate babbling fools? They value rank; I value righteousness. All are drunk; I alone am sober.\n\nThen came the summons—my name drawn from the register, submitted to the authorities. The brush’s dot marked my fate, consigning me to my homeland. Though I craved the honor of a discerning gaze, I broke the vow of a humble life. Scarcely had the first drops of time passed before I was bound to service, often sighing as I tended to my wounds. My learning is insufficient—how can I uphold the standards of civility? My abilities are dull—surely I will fail in both public and private duties. Not only will I shame the chrysanthemum sacrifices, but I will also stain the peach and plum.\n\nHere, I humbly encounter one whose name ranks high among the imperial scholars, whose position graces the purple halls. As vice-prefect, you govern the wilds, your might subduing the foxes and hares of a thousand villages. As magistrate of Xiao and Zhu, your transformative influence tames the fish and swine of three districts. You shatter the heads of demons with a mere clerk’s mark; the female drought-demon falls victim to a year of famine. Loving the people as your children, you transport grain across the river. Through relief, you revive Qingzhou—your hidden virtue rivals that of the noble Fu. Through generosity, you welcome the humble—your magnanimity surpasses even that of the Duke of Zhou.\n\nThus, even a recluse from the mountains and forests may find a place at the sacrificial table, a crane in dark robes mistaken for a fly in ink. How dare I not, alongside my books, purify myself in the springs and rocks? Perhaps then, in my stillness, the people will be upright; in my old age, the young will find peace. May you enjoy wealth, longevity, and many sons—from Hua’s borders, I offer blessings to the emperor. May harmony and joy in office be sung in praise of the Ministry of Revenue.\n\nI fear that if I hasten to join the ranks of the stars, I will suddenly lose the support of your two heavens. In my devotion and reliance, I have laid bare my heart.\n\nA Reply to Vice Prefect Zhao of Linjiang\n\nA crane in dark robes had barely glimpsed the muddied carriage-pole when a pair of fish—your letter on silk—suddenly arrived at my mountain door. Its lines gleamed bright as brocade, its gifts rained down like blessings. I read and reread without weariness, moved and enlightened in equal measure.\n\nI once thought those of lofty conduct shunned kings and lords, that immortals wandered only through the dust of markets. Yet when I hid my southward flight on Huading Peak, noble guests came unbidden; when Lü Dongbin appeared in Yueyang, the people failed to recognize him. As for dwelling in mountains while engaging the world, or stepping beyond the city walls to present oneself—so much of life has already been lost. How could one meeting restore what was?\n\nRecently, I heard you had been honored with a palanquin and returned in a cavalcade of riders. Though I am no Daoist master in yellow cap, how could I neglect the rites of suburban welcome? Though you descend to a scholar of humble cottage, I beheld the stature of one who stands like a mountain. My humble verses chirp like crickets or buzz like flies; my homeward dreams are of deer asleep and pheasants perched. Never did I expect such singular favor, such an honor as your fragrant letter. I carved the Heart Sutra and inscribed admonitions by night’s quiet breath, truly sharing the same essence as the sages of West Mountain. You handed me brush and ink—how could I unravel the profound thoughts of Yang Xiong?\n\nThe woven banana-leaf cloth passed lightly as five-zhu coins; the cassia-scented wine fermented in a single flask. When the provincial inspector sent gifts, all travelers marveled. I, a weary wanderer of rivers and lakes, have idly occupied the realm of springs and rocks. Fortunate to rely on you in this place, who else would speak for me?\n\nAmong the literary men of the imperial court, who would feel kinship with one in feathered cloak? Among the woodcutters on the road ahead, who would find leisure in straw sandals? I await your inspection tour, hoping to show my deepest respect.\n\nBoth the scholar and the woodcutter appear in your letter.\n\nTo Prefect Zhang of the Nearby Prefecture, Minister of Personnel\n\nThe silver hare governs the pasture; you honor the famous mountains within your borders. Children on bamboo horses welcome the new magistrate, calling back the lone crane from the clouds. Roads were cleared to await your arrival like Jia Yimin’s; passes were guarded with the reverence of Yin Xi for Laozi. All vied to be first in greeting—etiquette dictates that congratulations come before all else.\n\nI respectfully consider your name renowned throughout the cosmos, your learning bridging heaven and humanity. Your ancestors’ tablets and your father’s robes have been inscribed on Wild Goose Pagoda for generations; your ministerial seals and scholar’s satchels have made you preeminent at Dragon Gate in this age. The emperor declared you a worthy successor and appointed you Academician. You compiled records in the imperial archives and participated in the rigorous evaluations of the Ministry of Personnel. Though clad in plain cloth, you retired from court, only to be entrusted with a new mandate. Your administrative brilliance outshone even Shen Yue’s embroidered robes; your morning sails swelled with the tide at Xiao Shoals. With five horses and no trace of gray hair, you are still in your prime. Linked to the two Lius and the three Kongs, you personally inherit their legacy. Your governance has brought such peace that I await the composition of poems celebrating harmony.\n\nYet I reflect on the people’s hardship: though the records show abundant harvests, taxes are levied by the acre, nearly exhausting the rice and millet of the southern fields. You seek paper mulberry along the clear river and search for pollia on fragrant isles. Old and new debts alike are treated lightly, while both public and private coffers stand empty. Without a hand swift as thunder, how could one implement policies to revive the nation? A pair of brushes has already begun to transform customs; though you stand but a foot and a half from heaven, you swiftly recommend the worthy to high office.\n\nI humbly recall my own escape from Confucian pursuits early on, my slow progress on the Dao. I have not yet prepared the cauldron for the nine refinements, yet rashly ascended the halls of the venerable elders. I once served under military tents, handling shields and ink for dispatches; at the Golden Gate, I composed imperial responses by the light of a rush lamp. Fortunate to have requested and received the most leisurely post, I should have shut my gate and slept soundly. Instead, I mistakenly heeded the calls of my homeland’s people and was nominated to fill an empty seat. External pressures led to internal strife; how could I stand by and do nothing?\n\nWhy should I cling to this cap, when you, my lord, value my lingering presence? Others may draw their bows, but my juniors inevitably follow, jostling for advantage. I watch for your banner to halt, trusting in your clear judgment. In Yueyang, I paid respects to Zijing—not daring to be dazzled by the medicine in his gourd. Like Quan Jiao encountering Yingwu, I hope only to gather firewood from the valley floor.\n\nIn admiration and gratitude, I inscribe these words without restraint.\n\nTo Chief Prosecutor Xiao Dazhuo\n\nHaving long heard of your esteemed name, I had planned to pay my respects at the Prosecutor’s Terrace, only to find your reclusive dwelling seemingly unoccupied—leaving me deeply ashamed before the clouds and peaks. I hastily composed this humble offering, though I fear it may offend your solemn dignity.\n\nFor I have heard that noble and base alike may share the stable of ox and steed, and that dragons and serpents arise from deep mountains and vast marshes. Though the natures of things differ tenfold or a hundredfold, how can the records of history deem them all without merit? A worthy like Yan Ziming would never confine himself to Yan’s chamber, nor would a scholar like Zilu remain idle at Confucius’ gate. Now, with your royal splendor adorning these woods and ponds, the very grasses and trees seem to swell with imperial qi.\n\nThe immortals are not far—only the golden lock need be unlatched. Chariots and horses have been seen, yet they need not plunge deep into the reeds. I shrink from the heat of those who flaunt their robes, and laugh at the madness of those who knock on gates like the reckless magistrate. Though my tattooed words may blur, my tongue remains sharp. Yet when I glimpsed your five-flowered judgment splitting the hall, I nearly made our teaching as light as a single leaf. Those petty disputes of sparrows and rats may weary even a judge like the Duke of Shao, but when dragons’ heads and pigs’ bellies gather to compose poetry, is there ever a lack of talent like Mi Ming?\n\nOverwhelmed by my own ignorance, I am almost compelled to heed the call to approach. I reverently consider your eminence: a pillar of Confucian learning, a scholar of vast erudition, a talent fit to serve the throne. You continue the legacy of the Tang chancellors, where even Yu nearly matched their stature, and rival the heroes of the Han, where I cannot compare. Having ascended the ranks of Penglai’s pure halls, you now wield the stern authority of the Censorate. When you deign to inspect the provinces, famine-stricken multitudes are saved by your grain distributions. Clad in your embroidered robes, at ease in your scholar’s cap, you soar before alighting—your succession a lofty act, your justice reviving the dead, your virtue spreading like a balm.\n\nYou personally review prisoners in the summer heat, rising early to consult widely. Like two stars, you hasten to the sacred altar; like the Five Plains, you draw down rain from the Silver River. No need to brave the perilous rapids of the imperial court—you shall soon stand in the Hall of Illumination.\n\nAs for myself, I am clumsy in self-governance and unknown in the Dao, a wanderer feeding on others’ charity, yet never stooping to the buzzing of flies or the fawning of dogs. Returning to my mountain retreat, I endure the laments of cranes and the startling cries of gibbons. Now, I shake the dust from my books and tend the alchemical furnace. I bar my gate to worldly guests and hold my clay pot among the garden laborers. Though I have heard of your reins being reined in for inspection, I dare not trail my robes to your door.\n\nThe Spring and Autumn’s censures extend even to those like me; who would dare presume upon your favor? Unlike the Three Disciples, I am but a speck of dust—yet if you deign to glance my way, I would exhaust both ends of my meager wit, though I fear I may still share their fate. Is this not a guest’s attempt to deflect mockery? Surely I am not one who delights in argument.\n\nTo the Grain Transport Commissioner:\nYour Excellency’s bridle gleams as you prepare to dispatch the wooden-ox carts of grain, while this humble scholar’s rice pot remains empty—now that you’ve moved the Jade Maiden’s kitchen. I have heard that governing begins with ordering one’s household; here, then, is your chance to observe true administration. Alas, if I must depart, how can I do so without words?\n\nI owe two qing of fields near the city walls, yet I never took joy in the humble lane’s single basket of food. Thus, I set out from the distant frontier, becoming a guest who feeds at the tables of lords. Beyond my gate, the Eastern Lord never starved; atop the mountain, Du Fu was ever lean. I have endured the bitterness of cold scraps and stale meat, and long since resolved to return to my early leeks and late millet. You were transferred from the capital to the provinces, while I, the guest, was driven away only to return.\n\nBeating the drum and roasting fresh meat, I marveled at my luck in meeting such an auspicious day. Yet gaping like a fledgling awaiting food, I did not realize the hour had passed noon. To cleanse the people’s eyes and ears, your decrees may seem too harsh—yet if you burden others with their bellies’ demands, which weighs heavier in propriety? Even if you bound ten armfuls of reeds, how many ladles could they hold? How can I endure the rumbling thunder of a sky without mercy, or idly watch the sun standing tall upon the earth?\n\nIf not for the brush of the clerk, who would pity the prince’s plight? Once the bean broth is secured, life persists; though coarse fare is easily prepared. Yet if you recall the beggar at the eastern gate, my manners were lacking—though I entrusted the cooking to the kitchen, where care is naturally taken. How could I have expected the whip to fall upon the carriage attendants? Though one may \"throw the rat without fear,\" the shock of striking the duck is far greater.\n\nWhen the wine did not reach me, Gongrong bore no grudge—yet he still distinguished between kin and stranger. When sweet wine was forgotten, Mu Sheng departed at once—knowing well the time to leave. If you still harbor affection for the beans, you only deepen the mockery of \"hewing sandalwood.\" I humbly consider your eminence: endowed with celestial brilliance, inheriting your ancestors’ noble legacy, content with simple fare for yourself, yet sharing others’ joys and sorrows. You once led a million troops with oil-bannered tents to Lian River, and your retinue of three thousand pearl-shod guests rivaled Lord Chunshen’s.\n\nIf you momentarily forgot your own hunger, it was not that you failed to share your food. Your caution in conduct still reflects distinctions—better to have no petty quarrels to trouble others than to lack the bold, unyielding knights who would rally to me. Permit me to depart henceforth, and graciously allow my return. Awakened by the millet dream, I renounce the wealth of Handan; nourished by the blue elixir, I shall roam Liang and Song instead. With my calling card still in hand and my baggage packed, I ask the way.\n\nTo Inspector Taiyi of Wudu:\nThe lamps of Taiyi shine brightly, and I, unworthy, have joined the elders. Su Shi’s embankment lies near, and I have sought the Three Worthies. This may serve as a temporary refuge, though critics may scorn it as a secluded valley.\n\nI have learned that your mastery of the law rivals Jin Meng’s ferocity, and your poetry continues the Tang legacy. You summoned the Rain Master in the dead of night, honored with an ivory tablet; you grasped the sun’s essence in your left hand, its light overflowing the black wheel. Not only have you perfected the prayers of the temple, but you have also attained the subtleties of alchemical refinement. As we compose matching verses in joy, I recall that partings and meetings have their time.\n\nYour grand compositions and generous gifts humble me, like a rabbit’s burrow beside your splendor, or a swallow’s nest borrowed at dusk. If you call the Perfected One’s lotus-leaf boat, perhaps you might visit me; if you continue the Recluse’s plum-blossom verses, you shall surely surpass me. My gratitude resides in my heart, though my thanks may never fully appear on my face.\n\nTo the Right Street Supervisor of Ritual Propriety, Xie Tiju,\n\nReturning to my vegetarian residence, I merely follow the old path; the rites completed at the palace, I am now assigned to the initial post. Truly, official rank and insignia must not be lent to others—what have wealth and nobility to do with me? To refuse the imperial decree would be shameless indeed.\n\nI reflect that I possess no skills, only a stubborn temperament. With a pure heart, I dwell alone, finding it difficult to seek the intimacy of teachers and friends; though my hair has turned white, I have returned once more, never abandoning the righteousness between sovereign and subject. Your generous gifts repeatedly fill my chests and baskets, and your literary compositions often reach the imperial gaze. Unworthy of the sovereign’s grace, I fortunately encountered the ancestral sacrifices. Amidst the myriad blossoms clustering the imperial procession, I beheld the splendor of the celestial retinue; with a single decree issued in the court, I suddenly found myself selected among the Daoist officials. In matters of administration, I am tasked with the minutiae of rice and salt; as a ritual master, I wield talismanic water to channel the numinous. Who would have thought this dullard could stand among such esteemed company?\n\nThis is all due to your reverence for the Dao and compassion: pitying one who has come from afar, my title remains unchanged; unwilling to let even a single man weep, my footsteps ascend alongside others. Once I heard of the great strategist; now I see the lofty practitioner of austerities. My arms grow weak and nearly useless, my purse empty and unworthy of scrutiny. Without money, nothing moves—like the hare’s plea for hemp to patch its burrow. With books to read, I can only beg to return home, my bones as frail as a turtle’s.\n\n**From the Director of the Taiyi Palace, Xie Tiju,**\n\nWith a clear mind and simple affairs, I strictly adhere to the rules of vegetarian residence. Though the favor is weighty, my standing is slight, and I overstep in managing palace affairs. While my memorials ascend swiftly, my talents are meager and untrained.\n\nI privately consider that the divine abode you oversee ranks foremost before the throne, and the Daoist tradition is revered as if in the heavens. Yet in recent years, it has strayed from its former reputation: neither benevolent nor profound, it has lost the joy of Zhuangzi’s bridge; whether like Zang or Gu, all indulge in gambling games. Those who read the *Huangting Jing* miswrite many characters; those who annotate the *Zhouyi* scarcely apply their red ink. They learn cunning in the marketplace but cultivate solitude in the court. To stem this decline, steadfast resolve is essential.\n\nAs for myself, I know my body is afflicted, yet I seek nothing from the world. Having been summoned back to my hometown, I was again called to the capital. Forsaking the near for the distant, I vied to see the newly inscribed imperial brush; relinquishing honor for humility, I preserved only my old felt mat. Emulating the frugality of a bamboo basket and gourd ladle in a narrow alley, I long for the bamboo shoots and ferns of spring mountains. The expenses multiply, filling the gaps in my robes and collars. When asked what I desire, I shake my head and lodge a formal complaint. Those who know me ask what I seek—face to face, I receive only boundless favor.\n\nHow could I presume to stand above others, yet find myself placed west of the abbot’s quarters? Taking on trivial duties in my leisure, I have already lost my original intent. To leave would be to linger; to stay would be a misguided plan.\n\nThis is all due to the exemplary conduct of my predecessors, whose skeletal frames resembled those of emaciated immortals. The cinnabar warms the three elixir fields, yet they do not rely on youthful medicines; incense lingers in their chambers as they leisurely peruse the scriptures at dawn. Adorned with vermilion bows and fox-fletched arrows, they serve the sovereign; praying at osmanthus halls and bamboo palaces, they protect the realm. All who don the feathered robes share in the spring breeze of your guidance.\n\nHow dare I not wash my hands and serve the public, leading with an upright demeanor? I shall strive to repay the blessings of my austerities and weigh the propriety of advancement and retreat. Though I know my current appointment is undeserved, I cannot defy the sovereign’s command. I hope to resign next year, allowing this recluse to return home.\n\n**To Xu Shukuan, in Gratitude for His Visit,**\n\nI lowered Chen Fan’s couch, long admiring your household; you visited Yang Xiong’s pavilion, suddenly arriving at my humble abode. I regret we did not become friends sooner, yet you honored me with such earnest courtesy.\n\nI reflect that you were born where twin swords harbor spirits, your five carts laden with books. Your understanding of things is lucid and bright; with hands clasped, you compose verses effortlessly. Borne by the whirlwind, you lament that plucking your beard came late. You have savored the flavors of pickled vegetables and salt from your satchel, and carried your staff to admire the wonders of mountains and rivers. Though impoverished, your resolve only strengthens; no power can bend you.\n\nYou take \"reverence, magnanimity, trustworthiness, diligence, and kindness\" as your courtesy name, facing the purple catalpa together. Among the worthy and talented, you ascend, climbing the cinnamon branches side by side.\n\nI, who dwell in the mountains and grow old, see few visitors at my door. Yet I hold your magnificent compositions, recognizing the refined guest before me. Yang Shi’s words for me are apt—I surely avoid the criticism of plucking a hair for the world’s benefit. Xu You’s son recites the line about turning back to astonish guests. My song is never enough; a brief stay would be best.\n\n**To Zou Yuanshu, in Thanks for the Meal Token,**\n\nWhen grain distribution reached the mountains, I followed the sprouts to the upper fields; when the token was issued from the treasury, it provided meals for the master. This shows not only your compassion for a guest but also your reverence for a teacher. The provisions have been long in place; my gratitude is overdue.\n\nI reflect that you possess vast \"paper fields\" and have inherited the \"seeds of books.\" Fearing to enter Chang’an and boil cinnamon, how could I accept coarse rations? Your disciples have served for years—some mock the ease of following a master, while others, as great men unable to feed themselves, fittingly receive food to stave off hunger. Though different from Mencius’ nourishment of Zhong, I avoid Yan Hui’s cooking. The general is not yet old, and his followers are all inspired.\n\nToday, a single bowl of rice is casually scooped from the clouds; in the future, five tripods of delicacies will surely be presented to the honored guest.\n\nI have long borne the burden of an empty granary, occasionally opening an old shop. I sigh for the fallen beans of my mountain while envying the millet growing in your valley. My mother, fond of scorched pots, finds joy in my return; my brother, due to a tilted cauldron, incurred the resentment of a twisted arm. The couch is put away once more, though the new branches remain.\n\n**To Lin, Administrator of the White Cloud Abbey on Maoshan,**\n\nThe couch is hung again, shaming the green grass before the hall; your letter arrives from afar, having parted with the white clouds on the ridge. Reading it in the heat, the breeze is most refreshing.\n\nI reflect that you early shed the scholar’s robe, boldly seeking the elixir of return. Your words become poetry, your speech untouched by worldly smoke and fire. When the Dao prevails, you wander among men, forming bonds over porridge and rice. By chance, you encountered great armies and famine years, briefly relying on your elder sister beneath the bright moon.\n\nI await a single letter, ready to tread the paths of both streets.\n\nMy years now wane, worldly flavors all grown thin—I cannot bear to while away my days in office, yet my playful wanderings remain among men. I move backward in my ways, recognizing only the characters of Ziyun; should you laugh at me, we might together seek the plums of Hejing.\n\n**To Zhou Ziru, who urges me to write poetry,**\nI receive word of your transcendental journey—would you deign to visit this cloud-sealed retreat? Our dust-trailing conversation confirms you are no empty scholar; the scroll as thick as an ox’s waist, you say, is the work of a great master. You send me a pair of matched letters, humbly demanding my mediocre verses. I beg to be as pure as cold-water jade—how could I repay you with a lute of green silk? Though the *Three Hundred Poems* are many, what use are they? They only burden your servants, Hong Ya and Ge Duo.\n\nMy mother, at seventy, clings to me as our sole bond; I recall with longing our home beneath Song Gao’s peaks, with its persimmons and chestnuts. My poor lines shame me—they cannot do justice to your grandeur. I read them with a flick of my spittoon, then overturn the sauce jar without a doubt.\n\n**To Lei Yinglei,**\nHaving retired to a secluded ravine, you are an exile beyond the court; presenting two chapters, you are a fervent guest knocking at the gate. When asked your age, you were born in the *gengchen* year—the same year Old Quan read his books, the same year Kangjie awaited his son. Your lofty recitations brook no delay—why doubt their far reach? Tell the boy to step out and test the clarity of your *lei*-zither; walk beside me, and soon you’ll vie with the jade pendants of immortals.\n\n**To Scholar Wang, who came to visit,**\nYou arrived with poems tucked in your sleeve, and I lamented our late acquaintance; I welcomed you with wine, only to hear of your broken arm’s misfortune. Sacred mountains are not easily reached—how fortunate that such a fine guest deigned to arrive in quick succession! I had hoped for clouds to part over Mount Heng, but the path at Stonehead proved treacherous. For though my writing flows as swiftly as a flick of the wrist, my official post bore the omen of a broken arm. Baring my right shoulder, I imagine the cost of a skilled physician’s salves; wielding the crab’s claw with my left hand, I must still manage the old man’s affairs.\n\n**To Daoist Zeng, seeking lodging,**\nThree letters to the court—what need for a poetry satchel? Six verifications to return to the hall—present your meal alms. Even if clouds drift from the peaks without intent, can one enter the mountains empty-handed? Though old acquaintances are many, the pure rules must not be disordered. If you set out as a wandering monk, I fear your fellow lodgers will carve you up; bring your ordination certificate, and you may stay like the crane by the river. I hope for your kind favor—my gratitude runs deep.\n\n**To Attendant Zhao, who sent a management writ,**\nTo end disputes and embrace old age, I sought to change past practices; to seek retirement and receive promotion—this was never my true aim. A painted curtain worth a thousand gold, a knock at the gate startling as two jades cast down. Ancient cedars tremble, stubborn stones are shaken. Long weary of flight like a bird, how much more exhausted are the tricks of the flying squirrel? At the crossroads, I already regret my lost way; on the hundred-foot pole, how can I advance further? No silver could buy my return, nor could the military treasury store my resolve. Tearing open the letter of Luoyang’s elders, I hope you see that I am no proud Yaofu; declining the rice of my hometown’s youths, I beg to emulate Jiejie’s early retreat. I offer a modest reply—pray, take pity on my condition.\n\n**To Scholar Nie,**\nReturning home in black robes, you stole the brocade of night-walking thieves; casting pearls to the ground, who would embroider the skirt of a day-sleeping scholar? By chance, a dream-flight to the immortals led me to breach etiquette in receiving a guest. I recall your name resounding in the north, your fame echoing across the southern lakes. Scholar of three ears, I remember our past exchanges; Guanyin of a thousand hands, I regret my failure to detain you. We never fulfilled our promise of wine and literary discourse—only the moon’s fall through the rafters deepens my longing. When mitre and shoes meet cassock, may we reunite in harmony; when boots and robes meet the hand-tablet, may you soon ascend in glory.\n\n**To Vice-Palace Zhang, congratulating him on his title,**\nGhosts and ants jostle together, mistakenly made leaders of twin altars; immortals and dragons fortunately gather, jointly granted the grace of nine-tiered courts. Not that our teaching lacks men, but this fills a gap in the mountain’s rites. I hear you are adept at managing affairs, your auxiliary labors profound. You journeyed to the court to submit a memorial, hoping to wash armor in the Yellow River; sitting on stone, you composed verses, content to transcribe clouds with your alms bowl. Your grand compositions dazzle old eyes. I have no private motives—only the public good. Purple decrees and yellow hemp, by chance you’ve achieved merit in a day; plain letters and green bamboo slips still rely on the praise of all quarters.\n\n**To Manager Chen,**\nMy pines and bamboos age late, my bonds of friendship endure many years. Striking bamboo to harmonize with dancing songs, I seek immortals on high; sleeping in clouds to decline the vermilion summons, I carry on the ancestral tradition afar. Amid the clamor of welcoming banners and gongs, you bestow verses resonant as metal and stone. My hair is now snow, my brush no longer like a rafter. An old horse treated as a colt—I deeply regret the errors of the Six States; later men gathering fruit—how many are as round as the Nine Treasuries’ coins?\n\n**To Lecturer Huang,**\nMy good heart is still water, my lecturing tongue stirs the wind. Reading the *Yi*, I attained a wife—privately I scorned the dragon-slaying son-in-law; entering the mountains, I met stubborn stone—personally I saw the sheep-herding elder. Your seven-character poems boast of my two virtues. My name was made through slander, my affairs through resolve. The imperial command renews—you humble yourself before Yangzi’s scales; the ancestral tradition may yet flourish—strive to inherit the robe and bowl of Master Tan.\n\n**To Supervisor Wang,**\nMy heart dwells in the cultivation of the Dao—my secondary concern is discussing warfare.\n\nExtending the prose of lone wild duck and autumnal glow, my body grows accustomed to roaming South Bank; receiving the Seven-Star Sword to slay demons, my lineage directly connects to the Hall of Madness. Delighted by the grand canon’s divine ordinance, you composed a new ode and bestowed it upon me. I, by chance, have gathered affairs—long have I hindered the worthy. The two kings after Zhang—how they evoked the lament of untapped talent; the one Fan in the army—still we witness his triumphant merit. Again assuming official duties, I return to report to Minister Chen of the Mountains and Streams. The Supreme Heaven’s Noble Spirit, I bow in parting from the incense and flame of the Bamboo Palace; the green felt is my old possession, awakening the mist and clouds of Mount Ge’s peaks.\n\nThe crowd mocks my expulsion and return—who recognizes the letting go and holding fast? My friends, steadfast as glue and lacquer, bestow upon me the favor of pearls and jades in verse. Roads crumble, carriages overturn in gorges, boats capsize—truly the human heart is hard to fathom. Water severs dragons, land cleaves hides—only my strength yet endures. Do not stand idle as a bystander; rather, open your sincerity and offer loyal counsel.\n\n**Reply to Censor Zhao Urging Spring’s Arrival**\nThe embroidered robe stands in the celestial spring—renewal has its day; the jeweled pagoda crowns the stupa’s tip—your grace towers like heaven. My humble words, though unworthy, hasten forth; I await with clasped hands your renewed decree. Privately I examine the Selection Bureau’s statutes—none are stricter than the举贤 of the Censorate. Several prefectures, countless officials, all depend on your seal; every case, every lawsuit, scrutinized for their duties. Though the crowd may be sharp as blades, they must emerge from my gate. Who, licking the elixir of Huainan’s *Hongbao*, lacks the glow of alchemy? Who, having received Ji Bu’s golden vow, would dare break faith?\n\nDeeply I consider: my learning is shallow, my father’s teachings scant, my talent unfit for the tent of men. Only the imperial edict do I fear; fortunately, my teeth and hair remain strong. Can I not labor? The affairs of a foolish son remain unfinished. Yet in advancing, I know well the elder’s truth. I shall await your light carriage in welcome, even as I cherish my humble broom. Examine the nine-fathom spring in the abandoned well; draw but a ladle’s water from the West River. Why this delay? I await only the first month’s proclamation of the bell. Service presses so urgently—lest I fear the midnight boat’s departure. Ceasing my endless chatter, I renew my earnest threefold plea.\n\n**Respectfully considering you:**\nYour reputation for fairness is long-established, your lineage flows from the Luo and Yi. Applying the strategies of kings and the decisions of states, entrusted with the duty of illuminating punishments and adjudicating cases, you traverse the Zhou plains in inspection—even the *que* stones remain steadfast. Leaning your long sword atop Kongtong’s peak, the rats submit; suspending your bright mirror before Fanggao’s gaze, the herd of horses vanishes. Since your assent is never lightly given, your search for talent is nearly exhaustive.\n\nI, unworthy, dwell in your kinship’s register, aspiring to stand within your master’s gate. As governance’s spirit resides in that single point, so too, with a feather’s insertion, one swiftly ascends. First honor the ancestral covenant, then the bonds of other surnames—only in great creation is there completion. Awaiting a state’s knight to repay the common crowd—this is not a humble student’s dare. My devotion is most earnest; how could I exhaust my supplications?\n\n**Reply to Minister Shi, Military Commissioner, on Recommendation**\nHoisting the commander’s banner, opening the commissioner’s frontier, the great river equally bears the emperor’s mandate; grasping the prime minister’s robe, recounting our familial years, even the humble grass prostrates upon the ground of favor. Gazing up from the dust of my lowly station, I behold the stars of your resplendent seat. Forgetting rank and dignity, I present my sincerity and distress.\n\nPrivately I examine the dragon-and-tiger lists of successive dynasties—though they boast many scholars, those who attain the wild geese’s formation in both families, three men each, are rare indeed. The three-legged cauldron stands by the Jiang’s Kong; the terrace links Hong of the Fan waters. Among those who vie in boasting their excellence, who deepens the pact of shared ascent? Through my late father and two elders, we are bound to the same gate. Half a prefect, I once accompanied guests up Yu Gu; our loftiest bond was beneath the embroidered tent. Now the prime minister visits his kin along the Pen’s banks—how graciously you deign to glance upon my vermilion screen!\n\nThe *Book* says: \"In affection like brothers, though surnames differ\"—perhaps your kindness extends to descendants without end. Yet the distinction between dragon bones and swine is clear; thus the soaring of roc and wren diverge. To speak when one may—this is to advance.\n\n**Humbly reflecting:**\nMy capacity is but a dou or shao, my thread of talent short. The lock responds to my name, barely achieving the effect of treading the scholar’s tree; the thorn enclosure’s test still awaits, hoping for the transmission of the ivory tablet. By chance I was touched by your beneficent rain, thus bound in this minor office. Reading the collections of Jingguo and Linchuan, I visited the *Wenxuan* tower of Xiaozhou. A noble person desires my emergence from your gate—how undeservedly I am drawn forth! A foolish son awaits the completion of your affairs—undaunted by toil.\n\nEarnestly I gnaw the bitter herb and drink the ice, gazing toward the cinnabar and plaster. In selection’s release, nothing is harder than the blade’s edge; in seeking divine aid, I have knocked at the courtyard of the Cai. Personally I hasten to repay swiftly, moved by your solemn vow. Receiving your lofty mandate in haste, I enhance the humble office’s glory.\n\nRather than clutching Lord Liu’s book while foul and fragrant share the same vessel, better to elicit Master Bo’s inquiry—peach and plum trees form a path. Perhaps through the washing of the ten-thousand-stone’s robes, I may joyfully wield a thousand gold’s broom.\n\n**Respectfully considering you:**\nEndowed by heaven with profundity, refined by learning to loftiness, your body resides on the sandy embankment—accustomed to the phoenix pond’s robes and bowls; your measure vast as the ocean, calmly swallowing the mirage’s towers. Ten years you did not leave Chang’an; eight seats you ascended as minister of state. With border beacons ablaze, the river’s surface should remain unruffled. Applying the model of Huai’s banks, you transfer the hand that presses the imperial carriage. Wielding the banner and feather fan, arranging the towered ships, the army’s might resounds in the willow camp—enemy hordes vanish into the grasslands. Easing the ninefold emperor’s cares, you assist the hundred officials’ tasks.\n\nThe father’s beloved son is also beloved—extraordinary scholars have long been welcomed in the eastern pavilion. Where the lord is worthy, the guest must be worthy—even a fool may be taken from the western house. I, relying on your gate’s walls, presumptuously drip my mouse liver, like the cicada’s suitor seeking owl’s roast. I pray you temper your abundant grace, bending to pity this unworthy orphan. Piling humble baskets of earth to form a mountain, I avoid abandoning the fathom-deep spring for the well.\n\nBorn in the garden of Master Shi, raised among the steeds of Bo Le—why bow and scrape to others when I may attend your lordship’s sandals? The oath of the Wen State hall endures in this world. Gradually I seek to take root and stand firm, to repay the shaping hand of the potter’s wheel.\n\nWhen the royal inspector summoned the recluse from his mountain, he still occupied the seat of the chief minister. Dispatching a messenger to the distant frontier, they hastened his return to the study chamber. Ascending the carriage post was like casting dice to select an official; approaching the palace gate resembled a macaque entering its pouch. By chance I washed away the shame of the hidden valley, or perhaps I invited mockery for taking a shortcut.\n\nHonored with poetic verses, I deeply cherish this bond of friendship. Now, shifting my courtyard to rein in the world’s customs, how dare I encroach upon your seat to answer the visiting star? Compared to the talent of \"eight dou to one dan,\" my words recklessly boast beyond Cao Zijian’s; observing a stature of nine chi and four cun, my achievements should belong to Cao Jiao.\n\nShould we journey east together, we would surely ascend to the heights.\n\n*End of Volume One of the Collected Works of Master Wu Zhai*\n*Volume Two of the Collected Works of Master Wu Zhai*\n\nBy imperial decree, the Reclusive Scholar Yang Zhizhi of Heishan, bearing the title *Right Attendant for the Mirror of Righteousness and Supervisor of Daoist Affairs*, respectfully submits this memorial in gratitude for his appointment to a temple post.\n\nHaving long retired to rustic fields, I dared to bask in the sun of your esteemed summons. Recalled to court, I finally acceded to the temple’s request. My duties, though nominal, bring honor; my stipend, though modest, sustains my poverty. Moved by the emperor’s grace, I humbly express my private gratitude.\n\nI reflect: born in a remote village, my nature is ordinary. While I have long cherished the bonds of teachers and friends, how could I aspire to serve the ruler or benefit the people? Barely repaying my village debts, I still owe my service to the prefectural office. Afflicted by illness, I sought retirement, idly consuming the state’s grain. Though I should have retired by age, I remain attached to this enlightened era.\n\nWhen the sagely emperor personally took the reins to inaugurate a new era, the virtuous were elevated to aid governance. He inquired after scholars, summoning the eight worthies by name. Though I declined the casket’s offer, edicts repeatedly arrived. Phoenixes and swans gathered—permitted to follow in the footsteps of the immortals on Mount Dao—yet my aged hound and horse, too feeble to behold the celestial gates, repeatedly pleaded from within. At last, my earnest pleas were met with compassion. Honored with the Eastern Wall’s books, entrusted with the Central Altar’s incense, I never left my rural home, yet my name was inscribed among the ranks of officials.\n\nWhat weight do I hold in the court of Duke Yu? My old age is doubly burdened by fate. More than satisfied, I call this an encounter with fortune. If I were to compile annotations, I would exhaust my life’s energy. The golden casket’s teachings for my son suffice for family study; the bamboo slips sent to the prefecture were mistakenly summoned for imperial proclamation. Shallow and unworthy, I contribute nothing to glory.\n\nThis is all thanks to your renown resounding across China and beyond, your merits securing the altars of state. You personally embrace the sun of Yu Yuan, calmly dispelling the clouds of the Yellow Road. Like Tang learning from Yi Yin to serve as minister, your virtue truly reaches heaven; like Shun elevating Gao Yao from the multitude, your ancient plans are reaffirmed. Laboring to renew a hundred neglected affairs, with a gesture you advance the careers of all officials. Though I am but a withered remnant, I share in this honor.\n\nHow dare I not strive to witness the Great Peace, prolonging my fading years? I intend to compose praises for the sagely ruler and worthy ministers, joining the joy of yellow-haired elders and white-headed children. Though my back warms in the sun, I still harbor the ambition to offer myself to the lord; though my cap hangs late, I shall follow with a memorial of resignation.\n\n---\n\n*In Gratitude for the Appointment of Zhao Dazi as Maritime Pacification Commissioner*\n\nI reverently note that the imperial court has issued its decree, and the frontier command has stilled its might. Clad in brocade, you return home—four generations hasten to court at the Wei Gate; a soldier strays from his ranks, yet a single word pacifies the crisis within the palace walls. The seas lie calm, and the emperor’s countenance is joyful.\n\nI hold in esteem your brilliance and distinction, your depth and breadth. Who among the world’s talents stands to your right? Deploying the arsenal within your breast, none can withstand you. For a decade along the Yangtze and Huai, through a hundred battles with banners and drums, your strategies severed the Xiongnu’s arm; your laughter brought the head of Zhi Zhi. Great merit blazes on your banners, while you find tranquil delight among springs and rocks.\n\nYet the times are troubled—how could you remain idle long? The land of Shu seems vast; you rouse a zither like Qing Xian. When neighbors quarrel, you astonish them with three arrows like the general. Now, guiding the reins with care, you swiftly lay down your weapons to receive their homage. Were it not for the support of the Luoyang and Shetai officials, one might suspect the Yellow Pool’s soldiers still stir unrest.\n\nOfficials flock to your court; the emperor leans forward in his seat. The Yandui rapids, like elephants, now serve the ships of Eastern Wu; the Wei River’s non-bear omens hasten your grasp of the western pivot’s handle. Quelling the beacon fires at the borders, you strengthen the state’s foundation like a massive boulder.\n\nI, a latecomer from the southern rivers, have yet to tread the imperial avenue. Though I have not ascended the Dragon Gate, how could I bear the chariot’s journey? Reading the green silk dispatches, I marvel at the purple aura. Whose appearance resembles Duke Jin’s? Perhaps I may harmonize with the welcoming party by the roadside. How much grain does the Grand Minister possess? I offer a plan for the Guanzhong region. In celebrating your appointment, I have no more to add.\n\n---\n\n*In Gratitude for the Appointment of Zhao Dazi as Pacification Commissioner of the East*\n\nI reverently note that the azure heavens have bestowed the battle-axe, and the purple palace has transferred the jade bridle. Your seat surpasses the plans Jia Yi once presented. Delaying your morning audience across nine steps, you govern the east of Shaan as the Duke of Zhou did. Seated amidst a thousand peaks, you grandly unfold the tented headquarters’ regulations, secretly conveying blessings to the capital.\n\nI hold in esteem your spirit, born between sea and mountain, a pillar of the imperial house. Your talents and aura are unmatched—none among the mediocre can compare. Your fame resounds; you have swallowed the Xiongnu of the northern frontier whole. Shielding the Yangtze and sheltering the Huai, your strategies are well-ordered; enriching the state and strengthening the army, your merits are resplendent.\n\nOccasionally indulging in the pleasures of Pingquan, you leisurely peruse the maps of Luoshe. The king says, \"Return swiftly!\"—you soothe the apes of Jiange; a soldier strays from his ranks—you quell the hedgehogs of the willow camp. Better to hold a spring purification festival in late spring than cross the Lu River in May.\n\nNow, the imperial edict changes your role, planting you in the imperial homeland. The palace’s celestial foundations extend the emperor’s mandate for ten thousand years; the towers’ cloud-reflected shadows gather the immortals of Penglai’s three islands.\n\nThe refined culture and elegant affairs all belong to the leader of the outing; the gatherings and official records do not trouble the seasoned hand. Having briefly achieved accomplishments in governance and pacification, you swiftly ascend to the inner circle of imperial trust.\n\nI, who have mistakenly heard the morning cock’s crow and thus shared the journey with the imperial carriage, feel shame at having no counsel to offer, and fear only my own negligence and failure. Delighted to hear of your auspicious appointment to open the fief, I am most fortunate to rely upon a neighboring seat as your colleague. Your banners and standards may be glimpsed from afar, and your remedies and stones are ever at hand.\n\nAccompanying the marshal to the suburban pavilion, I can only imagine the gatherings by Mirror Lake; observing the extraordinary scholar retained in the eastern chamber, I still follow in the dust of your company. My admiration is profound, yet my words fail to express it fully.\n\nOn behalf of the congratulatory address to the Grand Supervisor of Huaidong and Military Commissioner of Zhenjiang, Wu the Vice Minister:\n\nI respectfully note that you raise the banner and oversee provisions, holding the satchel and governing the city. Your seals are stacked high, and the imperial envoys rank among the feudal lords; your prestige shines brightly, and your brothers continue the songs of Feng Jun. The offices and prefectures are newly established, and the gentry flourish.\n\nI reverently consider that you, a leading star of the Purple Enclosure, are renowned across the seas. In the realm of heaven and earth, and of ruler and minister, you embody the Dao of the *Great Learning* and the *Doctrine of the Mean*; in literature and governance, you ascend the ranks of the imperial attendants in Chengming Hall. In your youth, you traversed the halls of purity with distinction; with nimble hands, you managed the most complex affairs.\n\nHeaven ordains peace and order, and the emperor seeks counsel. As a high official with two crimson carriages, you do not disdain the Daoist abbeys of Jiangdong; with thirty bushels measured to the peck, you aptly supply the military garrisons of the northern frontier. The lamp of the mind continues the great awakening, and beacon fires cause no alarm at the Willow Camp. With unparalleled talent and spirit, you command the foremost land south of the Yangtze.\n\nWith ample supplies and the people’s trust, swords are returned to oxen and plows. With the Rong and Di at peace, the nation is blessed, and shields are wrapped in tiger skins. Swiftly returning to the ranks of the purple satchels, you ascend directly to the yellow gates of the imperial court.\n\nWe, mere straw and chaff, offer no aid, and our consumption of the state’s grain deepens our shame. Wandering the towers of Beigu, we laugh at the dust of Donghua. Hearing of extraordinary honors, we dare to recount our shared service. The realm praises Wu, and we secretly admire the footsteps of the virtuous officials; the army has its Fan, and we await with eager eyes the deeds of the esteemed lord.\n\nOur joy is profound, yet our words cannot fully express it.\n\nOn behalf of the congratulatory address to Wei the Vice Director of the Zhexi Judicial Commission:\n\nI respectfully note that you have been selected for the bamboo ranks and entrusted with the embroidered tally. Within the five hundred *li* of the royal domain, you serve as commanded, east or west; for thirty years of state expenditure, paper currency rises and falls with the times. Upon dispatch, you are given strategies for adaptability, and your authority to inspect and supervise is enhanced. The starry carriage moves forth, and the springs flow without obstruction.\n\nI reverently consider that your aspirations are vast and your demeanor warm and composed. Near at hand, you serve your father; afar, you serve your lord, deeply embodying the teachings of the *Ya* and *Song* in the Four Poems. Above, you govern the inner court; below, you govern the outer realm, penetrating the sentiments of the military across ten thousand *li*. Your colored tassels have passed through the ranks of the phoenix and egret; your weapons are already entrusted to the orchid-scented armory. You have plucked the osmanthus of the broad moon and now continue the *Wenxi* poems. The hall is built of white jade, awaiting the unfolding of imperial decrees; gold is as common as dust, and no one precedes you in rescuing the state’s currency.\n\nEven the inquiries of the Han envoys would be swiftly answered, revealing the abundance of the Zhou dynasty. Directly within the emperor’s library of maps and books, your radiance is not obscured; emptying the prisons of the common people, you align with the enlightened directives. Swiftly summoned to the emperor’s side, you are further honored with the intimacy of a trusted advisor.\n\nI, who once attended court with you, now share in your governance. The memories of our companionship are vivid, and the sentiments of parting linger. The chaff of my insignificance lies before me; how dare I recall the old days of resting beneath the scholar’s tree? Yet, like grass and trees to me, your fragrance endures—do not forget the loyalty of your medicinal teachings.\n\nMy admiration is boundless, yet my words are cut short.\n\nOn behalf of the congratulatory address to Vice Minister Shi, Governor of Pingjiang and concurrently Supervisor:\n\nI respectfully note that you have been honored with an imperial appointment and transferred to govern Wumen. Your virtuous standards stir the wind, continuing the footsteps of the imperial robes; the halls are bright by day, and the painted halberds echo with pure recitations. The offices and prefectures are renewed, and officials and people rejoice together.\n\nI reverently consider that your spirit is pure and your virtue vast. From a family of eight generations of renown, you inherit the ivory tablets of the imperial court; with a single classic, you teach your sons, secretly transmitting the lamp of Daoist learning. Even when Wendou was upon your knee, you mastered Chen Ping’s strategies for governing the realm. Your counsel is ever more refined, and your cultivation ever deeper.\n\nOn water, you sever dragons; on land, you cleave rhinoceroses, drawing the divine blade from its jeweled scabbard. Ahead, you spur the phoenix; behind, you lash the simurgh, driving the swift carriage upon the splendid path. Frequently entrusted with the half-bamboo tally, you have long reported the auspicious governance of Jiahe. Your benevolent heart embraces the people as parents, and your pure integrity is as unyielding as ice and frost.\n\nThe songs of harmony from the children ascend on high, and the selection of officials by the court must surely turn to you. The emperor, mindful of the people of Gusou, compares it to the vast prefecture of Fufeng. Weary from frequent changes in governance, the people hope for some respite. With your paired banners unfurled, all things exhale their breath.\n\nBoiling the mountains and seas does not hinder your reception in the envoys’ hall; holding the scales and wearing sandals, you ascend to attend the Jade Emperor’s court.\n\nI, who arrived in the capital most recently, am unworthy of even the sun’s warmth. My dreams are severed by the morning cock, and my skills are exhausted like the squirrel’s. Yet, fortunate to bask in your radiance so closely, I share in the shelter of your spreading shade. As colleagues in office, I dare to follow in the imperial procession to Ganquan; as a scholar awaiting your favor, I am surely an old acquaintance of the eastern chamber.\n\nOur admiration is heartfelt, yet our words are incomplete.\n\nOn behalf of the congratulatory address to the Chief Ministers upon the joyous snowfall:\n\nI humbly observe that the four seasons complete the year, and winter arrives to generate yang; with unified virtue, heaven is served, and clouds swiftly gather into snow. The cosmos is ever more auspicious, and the realm rejoices as one.\n\nI reverently consider that you, in your profound wisdom, harmonize the vital forces, consulting the omens of metal and grain to repel the wild, and pitying the soldiers encamped in armor at the frontier. You declare that the winter wheat stretches to the clouds, and you must still drive away the malevolent spirits; thus, the flying blossoms and frozen waters must be met with solemn offerings to the Dark Lord.\n\nA single thread of embroidery is added to the brocade, and the jade steps are adorned with six layers of snow. I, who have mistakenly shared in the grain transport, have witnessed this felicitous omen.\n\nThe fine wheat returns to Zhou, fulfilling the dream of a bountiful year; secretly, we bind Cai and await the daytime tidings of victory.\n\nFor the Winter Solstice Congratulating the Eminent Prince:\nI reverently consider that the Han inherited the celestial mandate, and its calendar extends into ten thousand years; winter yields to the year’s dawn, and the yang indeed returns on the seventh day. How grand is the founding elder of the imperial lineage, how fitting the auspicious omen of the river’s flow. I humbly regard you, whose virtue gleams like ice in a jade vessel, whose renown soars high as the handle of the Dipper. The king addresses you as “Uncle,” and you are enfeoffed with lands vast as the thatched hut’s domain; Heaven bestows upon the good man a lifespan as steadfast as the pine and cedar. In response to the embroidered brocade’s added thread, I offer the silken cord bearing treasures. I, who dwell in the fields and inquire of customs, know the shelter of summer when winter’s chill descends. The wooden oxen and flowing horses—how could they bear the warmth of military quilts? The jade belt with dangling fish—how I long only to draw near the imperial couch.\n\nFor the Winter Solstice Congratulating Vice-Director Shi of Pingjiang:\nI reverently consider that the phoenix tower records the clouds, harmonizing with the catalpa’s floss to mark the season; Tiger Hill lifts its snow, casting radiance upon the banners and standards. As we welcome the waxing of the yang force, abundant blessings converge in great measure. I humbly regard you, whose pure wind disciplines the officials, whose benevolent sun befits the people. In the eastern pavilion, the plum blossoms’ song still recalls the taste of the broth you seasoned; in the purple hall, the jade chimes resound as you take your place in the courtly ranks. Soon you will be granted the jade ring and permitted to inquire with your tablet in hand. I, who seek counsel yet offer little aid, have long relied on your sheltering care. The lanes and alleys hang lanterns, and I recall past wanderings in the grand prefecture; the palace courts resound with celebration, as we welcome the new imperial favor at the lofty gates.\n\nFor the Returned Congratulations to the Prefect of Qingyuan on the Winter Solstice:\nI note that the Lu observatory records the clouds stirring the catalpa’s floss to mark the season, while the Yin Tower lifts its snow, illuminating the repaired banners with radiance. As we welcome the waxing of the yang force, abundant blessings converge in great measure. I humbly regard you, whose pure wind disciplines the officials, whose benevolent sun befits the people. In the eastern pavilion, the plum blossoms bloom, continuing the mountain’s defiance of the cold; on West Lake, the ice congeals, evoking memories of leaning on the balustrade beneath the moon. I await the bestowal of Huang Ba’s gold, and the return of the jade pendants from the purple hall. I, who seek counsel yet offer little aid, have long relied on your sheltering care. Following you along the courtly paths, I vainly recall the traces of jade and jasper; in the new hall, receiving guests, I still hear the strains of strings and flutes. My admiration and praise know no bounds, yet my words fail to encompass them.\n\nFor the Returned Congratulations to the Prefect of Jiaxing on the Winter Solstice:\nI note that the phoenix tower records the clouds, verifying the subtle yang in the jade tubes, while Mandarin Duck Lake’s flying snow illuminates the auspicious colors on the commander’s flags. As we welcome the waxing of the yang force, abundant blessings converge in great measure. I humbly regard you, whose half-term as prefect has changed, yet whose prayers have inspired songs of praise. Near the five-chi heavens, the land gains weight through your presence; measuring the three-zhang shadows, governance renews with the season. Soon you will present the ceremonial slippers and socks, and return to the joy of filling the curtained halls. Towering over the literary stones, you will closely attend the sweet springs. I, who measure my worth and find it lacking, have long relied on your sheltering care. In the splendid hall, the clamor of music brings joy as I hear of the return of the vital breath; in the extraordinary fields, the harvest of grain prompts the submission of a report on the year’s abundance. In offering my praises, my words fail to suffice.\n\nFrom the Vice-Magistrate of Lin’an in Gratitude to the Chief Ministers:\nI consider that in this rocky district, I govern the people, barely escaping official censure; in the divine suburbs, I am suddenly honored with an appointment as vice-magistrate. Though the land is near, its standards are lofty, and I am ashamed that my person is humble and my talents shallow. The great potter’s wheel turns, yet how can I, mere mud on the axle, bear such a burden? Privately, I reflect that as the deputy of the heavenly prefecture, my carriage bears the title of “lesser prefect”; in the single metropolis of Qiantang, the court is closely surrounded. Though the staff may exceed three halls, the decisions truly concern the myriad affairs. For the pacification of the imperial chariot’s path, I serve as assistant and elder—this is no mere division of scenic delights to boast of to others. In the distant past of the Xining era, Su Shi occupied this seat; more recently, in the Jiading era, a remonstrating minister emerged from this post. Considering the weight of the responsibilities, one must possess both talent and ability to be deemed worthy.\n\nI prostrate myself in reflection: my origins are humble, my advancement late, my traces faint as the smallest blade of grass. My shelves sag with books—dare I yet fall into the habit of idle embroidery? My bed is piled with few tablets of office, and I bear the shame of an unshaped bow or uncast sword. Once, I was tested afar in Ou and Min; for three years, I drifted like a drumstick on the waves. No administrative merit to my name, no words of praise to offer. Returning east with my jade intact, I sought grain in Chang’an; knocking at your gate, I presumptuously presented a letter like that of Guang Fan. Though the six hundred bushels of a *zhizhong* might still be climbed, the fifteen-foot heavens south of the city remain beyond even my dreams. Yet by your great power of uplift and the profound workings of creation, days pass and months come—no need for long military service; morning departure, evening arrival—truly a convenience for my family.\n\nNot only have I been able to tend the graves of the orphaned on the plains where the wagtails nest, but I may also rest briefly in the village of chickens and pigs, allowing my lame steps to grind ink. In this stroke of fortune, how can I ever repay? Now, I humbly encounter your governance: the Eight Wastes open into domains, a single pillar holds up the sky. Xiao follows the compass, Cao follows the square—each in turn displays their merit to bring order to the age. The counsels of Fang, the decisiveness of Du—earnestly they cultivate governance to repel the barbarians. Office and rank are ever mindful of the heavy reins; men of talent are all gathered in the folds of your robe. Like unworked ore, I too am bathed in the kiln’s shaping.\n\nHow dare I not bear your great favor with reverence, upholding the teachings of my forebears? May I assist the mountain as it bears the carriage, and with my sash tied, ascend to the capital’s outskirts. What use is it to unfurl my steed’s potential? I listen for the whip on the locust-lined streets. How fortunate to stand among the hairpins and robes of the academy! I swear to dedicate my humble life in gratitude for your profound virtue.\n\nOn behalf of Zhao, Military Commissioner for Coastal Defense, I reverently note: your plans are deep and your governance expansive. In selecting a commander, who could surpass Yi of the Han? In military auspices, the Duke of Zhou presides over the east. Departing the jade steps, you set forth—heaven’s court rejoices in your union. I reflect that your breast holds ten thousand scrolls, your brush inverts the Three Rivers. From youth, you bore the expectations of the court; content with gradual advancement, you have endured the toils of command. When the court sought to rescue the paper currency, you embodied the noble image of \"pulling the roots.\" At the pinnacle of the hundred officials, you navigated the two handles of power. Passing the Hall of Government Affairs, even the prime minister would listen with changed countenance; applying the standards of the *Spring and Autumn*, the historians would record your deeds with their brushes. Soon you would join the ranks of those who wear the hairpins of the law and carry the satchels of state, to settle the discussions of gold and silk with the Xiongnu.\n\nIn ancient times, at Mount Gou, the spring muster was held. Testing the faults of six or seven paces, the soldiers would clamor and lose formation. Yet bearing the double honor of a second or third appointment, you stood resolute as you took up your post. The vanguard was on alert, the willows of Xiliu changed color. You personally bestowed the azure axe of authority, leisurely playing chess in your villa’s separate garden. Like Han Yu entering the camp of Tingcou, the young warriors submitted; like Guo Ziyi succeeding Li Guangbi, the banners shone with renewed brilliance. Swiftly hearing your praises, I returned to join your counsel.\n\nFor me, attending court is a great fortune, though my grain transport duties are unworthy. Relying on the lingering radiance of the pivot of power, I hope to join the pure gatherings of the Moon Tower. Moreover, with the vermilion banner’s departure to the garrison, I rejoice in the added luster of the purple sash. My wandering heart is moved by parting, yet how dare I presume upon such grand courtesies? You spur your horse ahead of me—I lament my own stagnation like a single phase of hardship. Breaking willow branches to send you off, I can only pray for a reunion in glory. Our shared aspirations and heartfelt designs—how could they be exhausted?\n\nOn behalf of the Guardian of Yanzhou Prefecture, I reverently note: your mandate governs the domain, your banner planted at the auspicious hour. Your name is inscribed on the golden tally, its brilliance joining the eastern wall’s splendor; your carriage bears the vermilion banner, towering above the guest star’s station. Why did Shu Du come so late? The traces of Wen Zheng shine still.\n\nI reflect that your learning rivals the archives of Ye, your bearing as refined as Kun’s jade. Solemn in thought, never lacking reverence, your demeanor is long practiced among the three thousand. Advancing in the Way, your magnanimity overflows—early on, you mastered the vital points of the twelve meridians. You share the reputation of the elder and younger brothers’ ocarina and flute, and possess the fragrance of the *Spring and Autumn*’s orchids and chrysanthemums. Fitting for the court, yet you serve in the provinces. Tracing the mast to the clear rapids, your halberds bristle along the upper reaches. Between fields and cottages, the people suffer under the white tax collectors; the granaries and treasuries stand nearly empty. Yet with your vision, you must change the board and place the pieces anew. Your skill surpasses others—you can make cakes without even showing your face. After just a few months of governance, the songs of the Five Breeches resound. Soon you will enter the ranks of the dukes and ministers, washing clean the armor and weapons.\n\nI, your unworthy servant, can offer no worthy embellishment—my royal duties are but toil. The hair in the mirror has turned to stars, the tides at the river’s edge rise like houses. I was about to split the paper to congratulate you when suddenly your gracious letter arrived. Recalling your thousand cavalry passing through the capital, we shared but a single cup by the waterside. Observing the customs of the capital’s left, I long chanted poems among the mixed ranks. Borrowing the path of the pear-blossom shade, I soon felt the joy of Tao Yuanming’s return. My repayment is inadequate, my longing for your homeland deepens.\n\nOn behalf of Zhao, Supervising Censor of Anji Prefecture, I reverently note: you have been selected among the worthy, assigned to govern the capital’s outskirts. Joining the ranks of a dozen or so peers, you honorably wear the silver hare’s seal; ruling over the eight hundred states of the Ji clan, you purely occupy the palace of crystal waters. From your first descent into office, every household rejoiced.\n\nI reflect that your conduct reaches high as the heavens, your capacity vast as the deep pool. Broad in learning and rich in knowledge, your staff shines like the blue flame of Taiyi; self-proclaimed in your elegance, you don the purple brocade of the banished immortal. Others know to rise straight to the clouds, but you proceed slowly, reining in your steed. Having soared to display your steed’s prowess, you now mount your horse to heed the cock’s crow. On the eastern bed of the forbidden palace, you have observed extraordinary scholars; in the western wing of the secretariat, why not gather the courtiers? Unwilling to linger in the shade of a single banner, you test your ability to summon the Six Guests. With ample leisure in official matters, the songs and odes resound near the heavens. Your retiring chambers are fragrant, awaiting the governance of Gong and Huang; in the hall of state, you will surely follow the footsteps of Fu and Yan.\n\nI, your unworthy grain transporter, have long known your compassion. Recalling our unhurried conversations at the gate, I rejoice in your vigorous assumption of the governorship. Not relying on passing guests to adorn your kitchen, how could you again pursue the clerks’ door-knocking?\n\nYour governance has so thoroughly satisfied the people’s wishes that I am truly convinced of your extraordinary nature. Yet the ornate letter you sent me seems still bound by convention. My hasty divination proves but a fleeting effort, my admiration a vain toil.\n\n**Reply on behalf of the Vice Magistrate of Changzhou Guard Temple:**\nI have learned with reverence of your appointment as prefect, exchanging the frontier post for pastoral rule. As the clouds part over Mount Heng, do not weary your carriage or feed your horses; when the moon fills the Xing Creek, you may truly drift as a floating home. With a single decree, your teachings spread; with every command, songs of praise resound. I humbly recall your learning vast as gold, your writings deep as the jade sea—yet you never climbed the vermilion steps of examination halls, instead hastening to vie for the banner of office. A thousand bushels of emerald grain—what are they to you? Your mastery of statutes fills your breast; your governance flows effortless from your brush. Graceful as the *yu* bird in flight, your reputation shines bright. Now, in the lands of Lingling’s rivers and mountains, you will consult widely and deliberate wisely, dreaming of Pingquan’s gardens and flowers, composing early your \"Returning Home.\" Above, you honor your noble lineage; below, you govern a neighboring prefecture. Though the mountains yield no tribute, your retiring chambers remain fragrant; though the post station grants no jade ring, you may yet test the ink of millet pellets. As for me—what can a starry court expect from one so unworthy? My frost-laced temples startle even myself. Though I fear the ruin of neglect, I exult in the fortune of your respect. Bathing in the Yi, I ponder Master Zeng’s lingering thoughts of stone shores and zither books; gazing at the Qi, I admire Duke Wei’s resolve to inherit the mantle of sandbank robes. My reply begins with these words, yet the ink cannot contain my gratitude.\n\n**Reply on behalf of the New Prefect of Jiaxing, Vice Censor Yu:**\nI have learned with reverence of your appointment, transmitted beyond the passes, as you assume the seal of governance. In the annals of history, this is Zui Li—a land renowned for its prestige. To aid the capital is called Fufeng, yet the heavens feel not distant. Your reputation spreads easily, reviving the people’s spirits. I humbly recall your bearing, lofty as Penglai and Langfeng, your temperament resonant as the great bell Huangzhong. Your breast holds the classics, all teaching the ways of honoring the sovereign and sheltering the people; your hall brims with vitality, grasping the essentials of enriching the state and strengthening the army. You ascend by first descending, having served abroad before returning to the center. You do not betray your office, for the noble man sharpens his weapons. Though younger, you are no lesser brother—why not join the ranks of governance? Will you linger in obscurity, girded with a cooking pot? Rather, find joy in playful colors. The emperor, mindful of the hidden dragon at Fuling, pities the people suffering under the tiger’s cruelty. His decrees renew, his reforms begin close at hand. Your oars glide smoothly on Yuan Lake—how different from plucking plums on Su Dyke? Poems arrive from Phoenix Pond, surpassing even dreams of Xie’s poolside grasses. Soon, you will repay the highest of caresses, swiftly returning to the ranks of the select. As for me—my grain transport bears no merit, yet I am blessed to shelter in your favor. Your paired prose arrives suddenly in my sleeve; I treasure it beneath my headscarf. To see you off, I might earn the laughter of palm-leaf skirts; to hear of your ascent, I await the songs of proclamation. My praise and hope are boundless, my gratitude unending.\n\n**Reply on behalf of Prefect Wang of Jiangyin:**\nI have learned with reverence of your appointment as prefect, governing the capital’s domain with virtue. As a passing official, you bypass the imperial gates without entering. Your plain letter moves me deeply; I strain to hear the sound of your carriage. I humbly recall your lineage, noble and rare, your conduct pure and refined—father and son both flourished early as orchid sprouts, yet now only you remain as the blossoming branch. Your ambitions are serene, unhurried, yet your steps ascend high. Having rested in yellow silk, you now lean upon the crimson carriage rail. On Ke Mountain, the chess pieces scatter—seek the immortal’s trace of a single axe. On Shen River, the waves calm—fulfilling the prophetic dream of three knives. How could you be unfit for a grand county? You are more than capable of nurturing its humble people. A brief trial of your governance, and soon you will be summoned to higher ranks. As for me—my service is worn, my toil unworthy. Though the law demands demotion, you promote me; though I long to return home, I must linger. I am no swift steed like Xianyu, yet dare I claim to be the grain transport’s lucky star? In the land of Yi, there is Xiang—listen for the songs of the three-chapter boy. My hasty reply is but a fleeting effort; my admiration, a vain toil.\n\n**Reply on behalf of Vice Director Zhao of Wenzhou:**\nI have learned with reverence of your appointment as prefect, bearing the imperial decree and the honor of a private gate. Rising from the rank of two thousand piculs, you receive the left tally in the Han palace; as a kinsman of the eight hundred states, you aid the eastern screen of the Zhou realm. The people sing at dusk, and I rejoice in your harmony. I humbly recall your conduct, lofty as the heavens, your capacity vast as the abyss. Your learning is broad and deep, your knowledge like the immortal’s green reed staff; your elegance is self-proclaimed, your robes of purple silk like those of the banished immortal. In governance, your achievements are boundless; in merit, your successes shine bright. Swift as a soaring steed, you rise to the cock’s crow. As a scholar-official in the capital, you served in two administrations; as a noble man bearing arms, you drew near the thousand peaks. The joys of Orchid Pavilion are unending; the longing of the Xuan Hall runs deep. You ride the green carriage, your retinue lush. Do not sigh in sorrow, for you are a compassionate parent to the people. With governance proven, you will swiftly return to the ranks of the select. As for me—what rank can I claim? I share only the humble task of grain transport. Weary of the dust of ledgers, I dream of pines and chrysanthemums in my garden. A crane follows you in joy, heralding your new governance; twin fish shame me, arriving before your splendid letter. Though I have not been punished, I humbly offer my loyal counsel.\n\n**Reply on behalf of Registrar Li of Taizhou:**\nI have learned with reverence of your appointment as prefect of the left capital district, your star aligned with the central terrace. Bamboo horses fill the suburbs—clear the roads to welcome the new governor; wooden oxen deliver grain—your colleagues bid farewell to the old. I envision your jurisdiction, your decrees bringing peace. I humbly recall your roots, deep as the immortal plum, your fame resounding like the celestial chime. Your debates flow like the Yangtze, endless in their depth; your decisions cut like a blade through empty space. Gentle, kind, reverent, and yielding, you hold yourself with ease—thus your actions are tranquil and harmonious. You savor the humble taste of the prefect’s crab, yet rise early to the cock’s crow. Your memorials fill the imperial carriage, swift as morning petitions answered by dusk. With many weapons at hand, you cultivate inner strength while repelling external threats. Gathering your spirit and focus, you now stand in the court.\n\nFurther refining your governance and assessing merit, you sought a prefecture. Your carriage with its black canopy ascends the cinnabar hills. Though the court’s decrees remain unenforced, the people’s ailments suddenly ease. Heaven does not withhold ripe grain from the barren valley; the city stands unburied as the river calms. Five hundred tea blossoms suffice for the stone bridge’s offerings; three thousand bamboo slips swiftly return to the Golden Horse ranks. As for me—what worth have I? My longing for return remains unfulfilled. I often recall our earnest court conversations, regretting only the lateness of our bond. Now, in this time of reverent service, I am most fortunate to rely on you.\n\nYou instructed the people in raising two mother swine, knowing abundance flows from harmony. You gifted me a pair of carp—how unworthy I am of such paired elegance. In haste, I send these scattered thoughts, my heart full of earnest regard.\n\n**Reply to Prefect Chen of Wuzhou**\nI have learned you now reside in the imperial presence, bearing the imperial charge in precious Wuzhou. The green-felt mat of my office and the seal of governance have passed, like Yao’s purple steeds, to your hands. When you arrived, children rode bamboo horses to welcome you; now, as the tripod of office is first entrusted, I am fortunate to have served with you.\n\nI humbly recall your vast learning and expansive writing, your Dao pure and virtue complete. Like the single qilin that emerged, scholars knew Han Yu was worthy of emulation. Like three phoenixes taking flight, people lamented Liu Fen’s failure to pass the exams. Having governed two prefectures along the Yangtze and Huai, you brought peace to the hills and valleys for years. How is it you now serve as a gentleman of the court, nearly fit to counsel the state? Chrysanthemums still bloom by the Tiao and Zha rivers; your boat often drifts toward Penglai. By the twin streams of bright moonlight, you surpass the three districts of Fufeng. The people of Tongxiang love you, as if hearing the zither of the branch city. In Bohai, exhorting agriculture, you listened to the watchtower’s horn. Seeking the transformative power of poetry and books, you traced the immortal’s footsteps at Chishi. I await your chariot bearing the sword and satchel, ascending directly to office.\n\nI, mistakenly sharing in the transport of grain, what counsel could I offer? Divided among the offices of the vermilion halls, I still recall the joy of attending court with you. In the yellow hall, reporting governance, I hear the songs of contented service. Now, as the sun’s appointed time approaches, I offer belated congratulations. Your precious letter humbles me; its splendor is beyond instruction.\n\n**Reply to Vice-Director Zhang of Jianchang**\nI have learned you were granted imperial favor in the Han Hall, now serving as vice-governor of the river city. For the people, you journeyed far from a single homestead, while I, hindered by the suburbs, could not welcome you as a subordinate governor. You called for a servant and obtained a foot of silk, entrusting the postal relay at the capital gate. Your new arrangements foretell the success of your peaceful governance.\n\nI humbly recall your mastery of the orthodox lineage of poetry and books, your noble integrity from an esteemed family. As a teacher to emperors and kings, you laughed as you retrieved an old man’s shoes at night. With the aid of rivers and mountains, your great hand naturally produced timely compositions. Wherever you served, you acted with effortless grace. In high office, you received the battle-axe like Jian Feng; in lesser roles, you still commanded the banners of Wanfu. As state affairs grow urgent, why not select outstanding talent? How is it you now serve as vice-director? Traveling the three valleys of Mayuan, you feast on qilin meat. Following the eight seats of Wenchang’s excellence, the mandarin ducks hasten to their ranks.\n\nI, unchanged in my foolishness, what use could I be? Still bound to the imperial court, I labor to reinforce the dikes against the surging tides. Thus, I dare not request a transfer, though I deem your favor too generous. Regarding our shared roots, my reverence is but a fluttering heart. Preserve the pines and chrysanthemums—return to the joy of the leisurely countryside. In this brief note of celebration, I still seek your wise counsel.\n\n**Reply to Administrator Lin**\n\nHumbly I consider how the Han envoy, riding his light carriage, condescended to convey your exalted command. The honored guest entering the tent first bent the pride of his distinguished travels. The post at Zaoqiu was but a toil for the weary; yet the talents of Pingzhou deigned to follow me. Gazing upon a single reed, I am humbled by this pair of fish. Reverently I reflect: your natural endowment is lofty, your administrative skill keen. Repeatedly you have submitted the finest reports on planting peaches, poised for a journey among the jujubes. Among the twenty-five stars of the Supreme Culmen, why not pluck their blossoms for the Gentlemen’s Court? Like the wine of Chang’an—ten thousand coins a measure—you might yet shake the lapels of the military commissary. Having somewhat displayed your cultivated talents, you swiftly ascend to key positions. Though I am unworthy of my post as observer of customs, I possess a rough heart for honoring worthies. Now that you, my old friend, have come, what matter could fail to be settled? I hope we may join hands as if drawn from the sleeve, not merely scatter coins upon the ground. Following the example of the *West Lake Ode on Plum Blossoms*, you still have leisure to spare. Compared to Nanfeng holding his incense petals, this seems beyond what I deserve. As my divination reports remain unfulfilled, I long to pour out my words in person.\n\n**Reply to Vice-Director Liu of Lin’an**\n\nHumbly I reflect: as I arrive, you depart—do not linger, leaving your talent behind the painted curtain. Your virtue is proclaimed and your renown spreads; rarely does one see such reluctance to part with the official robe. Your lofty writings have bestowed favor; how could I privately express my thanks? Reverently I consider: born of the cinnabar caves, you contend in splendor with the purple cliffs. Twin phoenixes at play, you early earned merit in the ink-sealed office. A lone egret in ascent, you once continued the verses of the pearl-hung curtains. Now selected for the minor prefecture, you hasten in rank with the great dawn. I am old; fortunately, military affairs have concluded, and I recall the lychees of my homeland. Already I prepare my return, entrusting plum blossoms to the river post. Do not forget our old bond; guard your health in the heat, and may I soon hear of your promotion.\n\n**Reply to Military Intendant Luo of Xingguo**\n\nFrom the Son of Heaven’s service, you are entrusted with governing a city. Speaking with the elders, you find the people starving in the flooded waters. The mulberry fields lie desolate, the cloth tax newly levied—all vitality has returned. Reverently I consider: you possess your father’s bearing, having repeatedly earned the highest marks in officialdom. Beneath the oilcloth tent, you often composed impassioned poems. Borrowing the steps of the jade hall, you frequently voiced towering arguments. Gazing upon Fuchuan as your command, you gather the many streams into a surging flow. The people, not yet relieved like fish and turtles, face the long-standing garrison of tigers and leopards. The emperor’s heart is set upon you; your capable hands are relied upon. Let the people live as in Qingzhou, where you personally tax the mountains and transport grain. Open the map of the capital district, and together prepare weapons and repair chariots. As snow departs and frost returns, my heart is weary, my body exhausted. To be joined by such colleagues is my good fortune. You have graciously allowed me to wander briefly; upon returning to my hometown, I have already resolved to retire.\n\n**Reply to Policy Advisor Su**\n\nThe emperor’s decree selects the scholar’s cap, sent forth from the Yellow River’s source. Your office resides in the advisory tent; you come to gaze upon the painted eaves. Your kind letter suffices to reveal our bond as colleagues. Reverently I consider: you are gentle and steadfast, serene and free from scheming. Having submitted the finest reports amid music and governance, you are willing to compose verses in leisure by incense’s glow. The suburban fields await your presence—why not summon the Minister of Works from Jiannan? The borderlands remain unrecovered; you bring the Xiongnu to the palace gates. When counsel is needed, you are consulted, and though unsummoned, you arrive in accord. By chance, I have fortunately returned from my travels and have already firmly requested a temple post.\n\nBeholding these petty villains as mere rats—how can this be called great merit? Yet encountering Shaogong’s descendant of the paulownia, one may glimpse the literary and scholarly legacy.\n\nWith the alert lifted but recently settled, my report in response has been sorely lacking.\n\n**Substitute Memorial for Prefectural Judge Zhao’s Recommendation**\n\nFive ranks align with Heaven’s decree, yet I dare presume upon the awe of the executioner’s axe. A single word of praise outshines the embroidered robes of honor; swiftly, the public carriage’s memorial is revealed. Sought from afar, all who hear are astonished. My deepest gratitude carves into liver and lungs; I barely unfold it in brush and ink.\n\nI humbly observe: the official path is often constrained by selection and rotation, while the weight of recommendation rests heavily upon the office held. To unite these four virtues is rare indeed—like seeking the roasted flesh of the osprey, it cannot be obtained. Yet with a single poetic touch, as when a dragon’s eye is dotted and it takes flight. Those below yearn to submit, while those on high delight in their achievement.\n\nI reflect with reverence: I am but a small and insignificant man, bound by a humble post. The Qing River and its jade-green peaks were once called prosperous, but now the green waters and red lotuses have become a sea of suffering. Drought and locusts follow one upon the other; in the fields, many wear the gaunt look of famine. Grain is scarce, and even in the courtyards, few officials stand in orderly ranks. While I diligently attend to my duties, I anxiously scheme for my own welfare. One misplaced arrow undoes all prior merit—thus I must first split the willow and advance step by step. Nine cinnabar elixirs transmute the bones; thus I lick the tripod’s rim and drool in desire.\n\nSpring’s light has only just stirred upon Yu Gu, yet the sacred relics have already formed within the stupa. Stubborn and benighted, sitting in a well—what purity or clarity can there be? Facing a wall, how can one become perceptive and quick? I evade even coarse blame from official censure. How could I presume to accept such excessive praise? My estimation only deepens my shame.\n\nThis is all due to your esteem, for you possess the talent to bear the weight of pillars and mountains, though your person dwells by rivers and lakes. Transmitting the Dao, you continue the pulse of the sages across a thousand generations. Unmoved by favor, you fulfill the heart of a true gentleman. Dwelling in ritual and music, you bring them luster; recognizing worthy talent, you inevitably raise it up. Yet one as feeble and trifling as I—how could I merit such searching and exaltation?\n\nDare I not sharpen my resolve for public integrity and incorruptibility, repaying your singular grace with utmost devotion? May my bearing resemble the joyous music of the apricot altar, my reputation suffused with the fragrance of cassia and orchid records. Perhaps then I may repay my seated patron at the gate, or even glimpse my late father in the underworld. Are others truly less than kin of the same surname? Like Mao Yuan, I am fortunate to claim descent from Zhou. Let not your voice fade into the distance; my heart, like the river’s depths, dares not turn against you further.\n\nWherever the cinnabar gate turns, the bright sun shines upon it.\n\n**Substitute Memorial for Vice Chancellor Pi**\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nThe kindness of your favor has entrusted me with a bond, and the high court has recorded my name in its ledger. The Radiant Standard’s letter has come, and beneath your canopy, I have received the recommendation of embroidered robes. You open the clouded heavens for ten thousand *li*, gathering peach and plum into one gate. The weight of your grace is heavy, my life light—gratitude runs deep, and tears gather.\n\nI humbly consider that for those awaiting appointment, the sole duty is to await their rank’s change; for those who recommend, the office’s charge is most exacting. To fulfill all four requirements is difficult, as they are strung together like the Tiger Marquis’s tally. To await even one is to seize the dragon boat’s banner with boldness. Without the vajra pestle’s power to uphold, how could the Jade Maiden’s basin ever be propped into place? Neither too soon nor too late—like taking what is already in hand.\n\nI reflect that I am but a rough and withered sapling, a lame nag slow of step. Floating like a lotus upon water, I first displayed but faint skill in assent; eating bitterness and drinking ice, I merely observed the precepts of self-discipline. Gazing at the seven steps, I stumble; circling the three trees, I hesitate. Though fellow candidates may lack feeling, I alone have borne the favor of the venerable Grand Academician’s regard. Though I stood alone another day, I still received the great Chancellor’s compassion. Just as the red banner tramples the victory report, and the festive robe floats upon the longevity cup, I recall the single cassia branch of the Xun clan, beneath the five clouds of Duke Yu. What virtue do I possess to merit such response? Yet the echo follows the sound.\n\nThis is all due to your noble encounter with one who heals the state as a great physician, a towering pillar upholding the heavens. When Lord Wei personally oversaw the return, ruler and minister rejoiced; when Lord Fengyang held the office of Commanding Duke, both parents were living. Spirit converged in one hall, awe spread to the four frontiers. The pledge of the Yellow River as a sash was firm; the *Fengshui*’s poem of *qi*-sprouts was continued. No matter how fine or coarse the talent, all were cultivated; whether in court or beyond, all were employed with skill. Thus the harmony of Ying turned the tuning pegs.\n\nDare I not steadfastly hold to my plain heart, striving to repay your boundless grace? Observing distant ministers, I see they do not stray from the bonds of father and son, brother and brother. Serving the state with the multitude, I accept the judgment of heaven, earth, ghosts, and spirits. Your commands I follow without question; to advance or retreat, what excuse could I offer?\n\n**Reply to Vice Director Zhao on His Congratulatory Summons**\n\nThough unworthy of the commission, I long ago severed the dream of the scholar’s lamp. The summons to return came with urgency, and still I am touched by the fragrance of birch torches. Now that the reins of governance are newly taken, I would follow the wall’s edge if I could. Yet I am ashamed of my undeserved position, truly the result of your praise. Before I could present my resignation in a carriage of *xie* bamboo, I was first shamed by gifts of brocade and silk. Compelled by your verses’ persuasion, I reluctantly rise to act. It is not that the mountain grows lighter when men depart; how can I avoid the shame of the forest and the remorse of the ravine? Though the night’s audience may not distinguish the lotus torch, the spring light has long been revealed in the willow branches. Since the throne does not abandon its ministers, dare I recite the lines of the northern gate’s hidden hut? As you see me off like a guest, I shall continue the poem of the southern ford’s green waves. Allow me to speak further, that I may be guided by propriety.\n\nWhat is raised must not be abandoned; what is loved should be aided. Briefly I report my fermentation; I shall await the chance to pour out my gratitude in full.\n\n**Declining the Monthly Salary from the Transport Bureau to Vice Director Zhao**\n\nBeside the desk, I wield the brush, vainly boasting of an immortal’s rank; within the tent, I draft dispatches, occasionally following in illustrious footsteps. My wooden tablets and lead have only exhausted my spirit; seals and sashes I return to my breast. Like one who plows not yet rides a horse, dare I hunt while clad in rags? Your gifts are too generous; my refusal is difficult. Initially, I pleaded illness, intending to reduce it in the coming year. If I still speak of salary, then my acceptance today would be wrong. Rather than accept a noble’s gift, I would crudely uphold a rustic’s integrity. Kindly refuse on my behalf; none surpass you in this. With lavish seasonal feasts, I have already enjoyed wine worth ten thousand coins; with forthright words, I shall seek the hundred thousand to buy a mountain. Permit me to divine the response; I shall separately express my profound thanks.\n\n**Reply to Wang Xiangxian’s Gift of Poetry**\n\nThe lofty scholar does not engage in petty official duties; Lord De seldom emerges, strictly observing mourning for his teacher. Yet after three refusals, you strongly urged me to stay, and now you honor me with two chapters of congratulatory verse. I measure my decline and inadequacy—how could I merit such praise? Only because I recognize the hierarchy of medicine’s ruler and minister do I not abandon the *Felling Trees* to preserve friendship. With the two of us as witnesses, I trust there will be no words to cast me down. With a hundred mouths, I guarantee it—there will come a day like Mount Zhi. Be patient a while longer; a light reprimand would be fitting.\n\n**Reply to Record-Keeper Xiong of Chicheng Abbey**\n\nYou emulate the immortals’ play at Red Wall, having long admired their noble traces. Like Yang Ziyun inquiring about rare characters, you suddenly arrive in a lofty carriage. From your sleeve, you produce paired verses; your clogs break the emptiness of my joy. Weary of following the examination candidates, I have personally continued the legacy of Song Yu. The fragrance of books and classics fills my breast; I grasp the world-transcending charms of mist and clouds. Literature is but one skill—idly I wander the arts at my brush’s tip. The two classics of the Dao and virtue I have long savored at the root of my tongue. When the time comes, I shall harness the moon and journey. Yet I am already old and returning—your praise exceeds reality. Gold and jade have their fixed value; I am ashamed not to be one who recognizes treasure. Wind and cloud enter my heroic aspirations—you should choose a place to establish yourself. Moreover, you are young; now is the time to read widely. I, Dongpo, have returned in decline; your reputation is yet to be fulfilled.\n\n**Reply to Scholar Nie’s Gift of Introduction**\n\nBeneath the empty eaves, the sun dries my graying hair; the full assembly stirs the wind—delighted to see a scholar with three ears. You honor me with brocade and silk, knowing we drink from the same crystal river. Long a guest at the Huai border, where weapons are not yet stilled, I have just returned to my homeland, where pines and chrysanthemums still remain. Why so suddenly cry hunger and cold? It is no harm to be content with poverty and live simply. I hide nothing from you—how can I grasp the white clouds upon the ridge? You must plan for yourself; naturally, there is a golden house within your books. Ashamed to be a host on this land, I offer only the wine of a fellow townsman.\n\n**Reply to Palace Supervisor Wang on His Congratulatory Summons**\n\nThe recluse returns to the mountains, yet still occupies the seat of governance. The messenger hastens to Long, urging a return to the disordered hut. Ascending the carriage is like casting dice to select an official; approaching the palace gate resembles a macaque entering a sack. By chance, the shame of the secluded valley is washed away; perhaps the shortcut’s mockery is stirred. Your poetic gifts of favor fill me with gratitude. Just as you move the court to inscribe the common carriage, dare I offend the seat to answer the visiting star?\n\nComparing eight *dou* and one *shi* of talent, your words boast more wildly than Zǐjiàn.\nBeholding a frame of nine *chi* and four *cun*, merit and fame should rightfully belong to Cáojiāo.\nTogether we ride east—may you return to the heights above.\nHere ends the second volume of *Writings of the Master Who Need Not Fast*.",

      "translated_text": "**The Collected Works of Master Wu Zhai**\n\n**Title:** *The Collected Works of Master Wu Zhai*\n**Author:** Yang Zhizhi of the Southern Song, in two juan.\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Taiping Section.\n\n---\n\n### *The Collected Works of Master Wu Zhai, Volume One*\n\n**Preface to the Memorial of Gratitude to Director Chen for the Purification Fast at the Taiyi Palace**\n*Composed by Yang Zhizhi, Imperial Bestowed Eminent Scholar, Right Illustrious Exemplar of Righteousness, Supervisor of the Teachings of the Daoist Clergy, and Abbot of Hezao Mountain*\n\nThe mist of Mao Cave runs deep, where I clutch the axe of mountain-dwelling; the bamboo palace nears the heavens, when suddenly arrives the summons to the imperial precinct. My name, mistakenly heard among the capped and gowned, my rank, prematurely placed before the black-robed and brown. Yet I reflect: the Taiyi Shrine is sacred, its deity most noble; the star of Shaowei shines bright, whence comes the title of Eminent Scholar.\n\nDuring the reigns of Jian, Shao, Qian, and Chun, many were the recluses like Chao and You, the ministers like Yuan and Qi. Summoned to the imperial court, they discoursed on scriptures and expounded the Dao; sent forth beyond the world, they were granted titles and bestowed texts. In recent years, such practices have all but ceased.\n\nWhy? Those who tread the byways and rush in outnumber those carried by carts or measured by the bushel. With a single sweep, common steeds vanish—all marvel at Your Excellency’s decisive judgment. With but a few lines, the resplendent phoenix descends—perhaps a worthy one may yet come. As for myself, I am utterly ordinary, clinging to solitude and purity. My habits, by chance, follow brush and ink; my traces wander rivers and lakes. The famous mountains and great rivers I have visited, I have taken in; the elders and predecessors I have met, I have followed. At times, I built a hut to gather books, resting in shade to still my shadow. Mistakenly appointed as a leader among the mist and clouds, I am startled by the passing years—twenty of them. I have not entered the gates of the capital, yet I have preserved this Way; the five thousand words I have bound and set on the high shelf, yet this culture has not perished.\n\nThen came the decree, descending from heaven, bidding me to offer my strength and take my place. In the quiet of night, by the rush-light’s glow, I swept away the dust of years from my mat. Unlike the men of Song, who borrowed the sun’s vessel to separate the fragrant from the foul, I am like Master Cui of old. Some may doubt the coexistence of tiger and rat within the same palace, yet I strive to cultivate literature and assist the teachings.\n\nIf I may offer the slightest merit, I shall return all glory to the throne, perhaps fulfilling my long-held aspiration. Yet I remain ashamed of my crude learning, unworthy of such boundless grace.\n\nThis is all thanks to Your Excellency’s noble nature, your person embodying warmth and reverence. The sacred scriptures and worthy traditions you have gathered like a sea of jade within your breast; your brilliant phrases and luminous words bloom like brocade from your brush. Your calligraphy and painting attain the subtlety of Zhong and Wang; your discourse pierces the mysteries of Lao and Śākya. In leisure, you wander gardens and ponds; when guests arrive, you entertain with poetry and wine. Such exceptional talent you delight in recognizing.\n\nI am deeply moved, my late years stirred to fervor. I gaze upward to wish the Sage long life, ever beholding the grandeur of the Grand Marshal. Ten petitions I seal in my bag, emulating Zhong Fangping’s devotion to his lord; three letters I carry in my sleeve, still hoping to ascend Mount Song. Slightly set apart from the common crowd, I receive instruction from this extraordinary favor.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial of Gratitude for Demotion in Rank to Vice Minister, Presented to the Chancellor**\n\nMy conduct was irreverent behind the screen, my breach of decorum before the ninefold steps. Impeachment deemed me worthy of demotion by one rank. Yet by the emperor’s boundless mercy, the court’s lenient decree, I was spared punishment—grateful, yet ashamed.\n\nMy nature is obscured by dust, my path lost in the sea of learning. Half my life I toiled in humble cloth; in office, I usurped the shade of the gentry. My father taught me loyalty; I barely upheld his teachings at the courtyard gate. In serving my lord, I spoke without reserve, ever cherishing my devotion to the throne.\n\nSince receiving the imperial writ, I have striven to maintain purity like ice and yeast. Appointed to oversee military provisions in Huzhou, I barely met the demands; serving as vice-prefect in Lanzhou, I endured the hardships of governance. Repeatedly recommended, I was burdened by the weight of imperial favor. Sent south with the insignia of office, I raised my gaze to the peaceful steps of the throne, inquiring after the people’s hardships—how could I compose poetry and song?\n\nBy the might of the state, I was fortunate to witness bountiful harvests and few affairs. Like a jade vessel preserved from minor flaws, I cherished my sustenance in Chang’an. Yet standing behind the imperial screen, as I presented my memorials, my tablet slipped from my grasp, and I lost all courtly decorum. It was not that heaven turned from my face, but as if some force tugged at my elbow.\n\nShattered teeth I stooped to gather—how dare I aspire to the lofty conduct of my predecessors? Leaning on my cheek, I wandered in contemplation, vainly admiring the crisp air of the Western Hills. The shame of the scholar’s green robe cannot be hidden; the punishment of the firewood gatherer cannot be escaped. Bearing the thorns, I return; on a straw mat, I await my fate.\n\nYet your judgment is rooted in loyalty and magnanimity. Though my name was stricken from the rolls, I was spared the ultimate penalty. Even the lowly, like the belly and navel, retain their form within the vast expanse. I reflect on my own head and limbs, knowing my kin await my return.\n\nThis is all thanks to Your Excellency, who unites virtue to receive heaven’s favor, emulating the Three Kings in governance. Unmoved by sound or color, you perfect the essence of loyal devotion; your fame and virtue stand peerless, preserving the relics of antiquity. At the feast in the profound hall, I humbly presented my modest proposal. Preserving this humble existence, you truly tempered the punishment.\n\nHow dare I not engrave your great virtue in my heart, caution myself against past errors, and cultivate myself with greater fear and diligence, striving to act in accordance with ritual? Though I withdraw my tablet and retire, I trust the Chancellor’s leisure will not forget this age’s debt to me. Should I one day present the jade tablet and be received in audience, perhaps my service may yet endure. My gratitude is boundless, yet words fail to express it.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial of Congratulation on the Chancellor’s Appointment as Grand Tutor**\n\nWith reverence, I learn that the imperial decree has honored the great court, rewarding merit by the true arbiter. The emperor, joyful, serves the Empress Dowager, bestowing the title of Grand Tutor with jade tablets. You, who harmonize governance like the ancient ministers, now rightfully occupy the foremost seat among the three dukes. The splendor of this ritual brings joy to all officials.\n\nThis is all thanks to Your Excellency, the pillar of state, whose foresight rivals the tortoise and milfoil. For five hundred years, the mountains and seas have nurtured your spirit; for twenty years, you have presided over the court. With majestic presence, you pacify the realm without a change in countenance; in binding Huai and capturing Cai, you restored the Central Plains through concerted effort. Your refined governance began at the southern suburbs; your blessings, bestowed by the Queen Mother, have now arrived. The gentry gather to praise you, inscribing your deeds in jade and stone.\n\nAs the imperial procession gathers at court, you lead the grandeur of the royal rites...",

      "translated_text": "The imperial rescript issues forth, elevating you to the exalted rank of Grand Tutor. Fields of fertile soil and lush pastures flourish in tandem, while the dignity of your carriage and mien grows ever more resplendent. Seated, you discourse upon the Dao; in audience, your name is not called. You stand as the singular classic of Song, a sage-king matched with a worthy minister; you tread the fourfold bounds of Qi, awaiting the true king from a different lineage.\n\nI, entrusted to the great turning of the cosmos, toil in this humble post, clutching the imperial edict in hand, longing to dance in reverence, yet gazing upon your crimson slippers, I find no path to approach. I stockpile hay and grain, preparing for the bandits of Yanchi; I craft pickled plums and brew yeast, ever to share the gaze of cliffs and stones. Alongside Commander Xie of Jingdeguan and Metropolitan Prefect Zhao Jiezhai—who, returning to seek chrysanthemums and wolfberries, sought a life of leisure, tending lakes and mountains, and now oversees the secret precincts—though the grand office may harbor intentions of summoning you, I fear the ancients would question the sincerity of such a call.\n\nI privately reflect: an abbey is defined by the Dao, and its renown grows with the person. Zhi Zhang’s learning began with the misty waves of *Jianqu*; Qinglao’s poetry sustained the incense fires of Jinling. Yet those who merely clutch wine jars and rice sacks bring only shame to the bells and porridge of the monastery.\n\nI, humbly, bear the remnants of a bookish folly, my sword’s qi yet unspent. A single ravine suffices to secure my late years; twice have I returned to my old nest after ten fasts. Lacking the missive of Song Gao’s pacification of bandits, I idly speak of journeying to court—yet without the raincoat’s divine art, how dare I hope for a palace to be built? Fragments of my writings have been repeatedly sent to the throne; my crumbling house and dilapidated walls remain as transient lodgings.\n\nYou, with a pure heart, take pity on this guest. The officials report a vacancy in Jingde, and your esteemed decree arrives with strings of cash and measures of grain, appointing a recluse as registrar. Some argue that beneath the towering trees, even orioles become disciples of the Son of Heaven—why cast aside a colt for its youth? Yet Hongjing dwelt in the mountains, building three separate lodges; Yaofu resided in Luoyang, establishing ten wandering retreats, ensuring scholars had a place to turn and elders could share in warmth and intimacy.\n\nAs for those who witness white cranes surveying the forests of Linwu or tuck blue serpents into their sleeves to soar past Dongting—how can such marvels be constrained? For Jiezhai, a single outing would not be amiss; for Xiang Chang, a solitary stroll along the long embankment would suffice.\n\nYou, resplendent as the finest scion of the Han, magnanimous as the Prefect of the Capital, fill the gaps in the imperial robes with your brush and ink, while even the smallest matters of firewood and rice win the joy of the city’s people. Leading small processions in spring, you rectify the sunrise at Xinting; inquiring after the immortal of the slopes, you gather Jingbai in one hall, summoning Mímíng to join you. You oversee the two sons of Hou and Liu, and though the Mountain Judge resists entreaties, the imperial voice grants special permission for free passage.\n\nHow dare I not compose verses on plum blossoms with renewed vigor, or plant willows in abundance? For dozens of miles, all is water, cleansing the worldly dust from seated guests. Three hundred years hence, someone shall add this to the new records of *Huangtu*. Respectfully, Military Commissioner Xie Guixin petitions to reside at Yulong.",

      "translated_text": "Amid the two streets’ imperial compositions, I humbly bask in the radiance of your flowering staff; across ten states’ talismanic decrees, you govern the multitudes beneath brocade canopies. Overflowing honors crown my modest petitions, while the solemnity of your retreat lends grandeur to the scene. To speak of the Daoist great mountains—none surpass the former abode of Jingyang. Where caps and robes gather, leadership must fall to the worthy. Passersby drool with envy, buying glib tongues with idle chatter; followers dip their fingers in, heedless of the common treasury’s pearls. Such men belittle themselves—our Way nearly collapses.\n\nI recall my own drifting upon rivers and lakes, as stubborn as wood and stone, unable to consume Shang Hao’s mushrooms, yet ever guarding Master Xu’s cypress. When the marshal deigned to visit, I was counted among his peers, vying for seats with ease, recognizing faces in the mountains. Repeatedly I dreamed of Tianbao’s jade cliffs, offering my scalp to the court, mistakenly joining the rites at Ganquan’s grand altars. Through inner jiao rites I presented poems, shamed by imperial favor that brushed my pen; though admonished with instruction, I was not permitted to return. Gazing toward Governor Yan’s chariot canopy, I felt unworthy of such plain ignorance; when the couch for the reclusive Master Xu was set, glad tidings suddenly arrived. Though I longed for both bear’s paws and fish, I could not have both—apes and cranes grew alarmed, then resentful.\n\nNow I prostrate myself before one whose name shines like sun and moon, whose might shakes wind and frost. You sought the Six-One Elder’s home on Longgang, advancing the finest of the prefecture; you founded the academy of Twenty Scholars on Egret Isle, cultivating talent. Recommending transfers of jade-tasseled green silk insignia, you jointly oversaw the splendor of painted beams and vermilion curtains. Unrolling maps to inquire of customs, you truly lifted entire households to immortality. I have heard that this flourishing realm has long lacked a master for its devotions. While crows and rats squabble before my eyes, which lone crane or proud rooster will win the people’s hearts? To the left, Fuqiu; to the right, Hongya—hearing a hundred times cannot match one glimpse. Near Huangfu, far from Bai Juyi—three divinations follow two affirmations.\n\nWhat virtue do I possess to deserve this, unasked? My worth does not rival that of Shaoshi, nor can I escape Chang’an’s confines. Abandoning my own affairs to serve your halls, I renew the vow to follow you one day. Racing through frosty skies to gather persimmons and chestnuts, I chant empty verses of last night’s dream of my mother—though the mulberry and elm are late, peach and plum may yet flourish.\n\n**Petition of Xie, Military Commissioner, declining residence at Yulong and requesting leave:**\nHaving received permission to withdraw, I briefly step from the ranks of the Flowery Palace, leading the assembly in cultivation, humbled by the Star Terrace’s command. Stricken by illness during the delayed season, I submitted a memorial to seek leisure. The imperial voice has not yet assented; how can I answer the cauldron’s words? Gazing back at the blessed land of your tented governance, I wonder if the empty seat’s tenure was granted too lightly—could the immortal’s spirit in heaven be idly toying with its seal? Yet the great prefect’s wisdom shines like the sun, not hastily demeaning others, dispelling the bone-gnawing strife of suspicion. Awaiting the horned one’s emergence as a qilin, public opinion is truly convinced, though it cost exhaustive search.\n\nAs for one like me, weary of rivers and lakes and content to rest, gladly rotting with grass and trees—three years away from court, I mistakenly enjoyed the honor of summons; ten years dwelling in mountains, I laugh at my own shallow schemes. With a forthright heart I detest evil, merely washing my hands to serve the public. Though my purse is stingy, my doorstep is crowded with shoes. The former envoy overpraised me; what talent does the present lord see? Dispatching letters by post, you showed the military officers the joy of open gates; sending word along the prefectural roads, you moved the governor to urge my journey. Yet my reputation still lingers near the emperor’s side—I fear my duties cannot match the theater below. Twice summoned, I did not rise, unlike the hermit of Shaoshi; though one couch hangs empty, surely a recluse from the southern prefectures will appear. May you justly weigh the selection, renewing the sounds of bells and drums.\n\nNow I meet one who is the Confucians’ paragon, a true prime minister’s vessel, fit to ride in light carriages to inquire of customs, swiftly planting banners to govern the people. Your orders in the thorn enclosure stir no murmurs from warring ants; your hand on the iron pillar achieves great feats in slaying dragons. Gazing afar at the lush shade of wellside cypresses, I lament the desolation of incense and flowers. Who shall be master? Consult the people. Forgetting the dignity of tiger tallies and dragon seals, you bestow the courtesies of crane robes and deer caps.\n\nI, pitiful in my meager fate, have failed to live up to your noble intentions. My black bamboo hat veils the clouds, blocking visits to Hongya’s old haunts; my vermilion curtains roll back the rain, still joining the excursions to Pavilion of the Prince of Teng. If you depart suddenly, I shall retreat and listen.\n\n**Petition of Prefectural Governor Pan, Minister of Revenue, reducing grain levies:**\nWith black silk cords I pay respects to the prefecture, daring to bask in the glory of the herb-selling immortal; with white rice I deliver to the granary, specially reducing the grain levies. Distinguishing blessed lands and grotto heavens, I cause the bells of fasts and drums of porridge to resound together. One meal reminds me of your kindness; two altars share in longevity.\n\nExamining the registers of land granted to the Black and Red, I find errors from the Shaoxing land surveys. Southern slopes are yang, northern slopes yin—fertile fields all belong to the wealthy; high ground does not drought, low ground does not flood—abundant years barely suffice for the common halls. When the temple documents arrive, the food rosters swell. As the court first implements the grain storage decree, officials vie to wield harsh authority. Defying the repeated sagely edicts, they refuse to remit taxes, imposing equal burdens on the three counties’ registered households. Snatching wealth like meat, selecting grains like pearls, they force the fields and villages to groan, heedless of the hunger in mountain forests.\n\nI, unworthily holding office, should rotate my food allotment. Moved by the people’s clamor, my heart stirs with sorrow. Lacking ghostly soldiers to transport grain, I truly fear the county magistrate’s ruin. Hoping children will welcome the fine lord by clearing the roads, I first secure lodging at the Purple Horse’s station. Seeing the elder enter the city, I mount a green mule, risking a thousand foolish words to delight in reducing the levies by thirty percent. Dispatching documents to the Yu family, it resembles Lu Su’s grain loan; bestowing favor on the mountain recluse, it costs no effort like Yan Zhenqing’s calligraphy. Though my means are narrow, my words know no bounds.\n\nNow I reverently meet one whose brilliance emerges from the earth’s foundation, whose prestige towers like the sky’s ridgepole—a single commission sets your oars in Qutang; ten years you tread the boots of literary stone.",

      "translated_text": "In a dwelling like a palace of water-crystal, I follow my own inclinations, free from the clamor of official dispatches at Guangfan Gate, moving only when I choose to move. Yet now I split the Han tally and journey far to Xiao’s shores. At fifty, I thought to remain in this land, but the annual grain levy of a hundred thousand measures far exceeds that of other prefectures. Casting the people into the inner moat, I cannot redress the failures of my predecessors. With sacred mountains within our borders, I must ensure the multitude’s peace through recruitment and conscription, demonstrating the intent to shoulder their burdens in their stead.\n\nHow could I not wield the ladle’s handle with care, still divining by lamp’s flame? A grain of rice leaves me gaunt, a bamboo hat already pities me like Du Fu; lacking wine in spring, lying abed, I think even more of Hong Ya. Forgetting my present post, I dare to cast my gaze toward Shu.\n\nI thank the magistrate of Jurong for decisively cutting down the thieves who plundered the cypresses. A thousand trees stood in the mountains, their felling strictly forbidden; the palace walls rose several yards high, yet thieves still crept in. The axe marks resembled those on Qianling’s tomb, and official business was thus entangled in the inner chambers. Punishment was meted out without mercy—how boundless your virtue!\n\nI recall the Queen Mother’s peaches, tasted thrice by the Son of Heaven; when Dong Jun’s apricots ripened, tigers emerged fourfold to devour men. The transformations of immortals are not so easily stolen, yet bandits and thieves cannot be avoided—how much less so for the raft-dweller on the sea, whose vessel may trespass the Dipper and Ox; or the cassia in the moon, whose felling still startles the toad and hare. An official transplanted the willows west of Wuchang Gate; a child carried away the thatch from Du Ling’s roof. Who lacks the six roots? Heaven itself has five thieves.\n\nReflecting on my own meager talents, ill-suited for tangled affairs, I have tended to cypress and cedar, swept the paths of fir and pine, and long cultivated the fire-jujubes and exchange-pears. Coming from the Three Maos of Juqu, I planned to plant a thousand trees in Xuandu. Beneath the moon, cranes sang among the pines on the peak; by the stream’s echo, no one remained—suddenly, the cypress before the courtyard was lost. Though unlike the forty-span tree that dripped rain, I had hoped it would endure eight thousand autumns. Unable to bear the rats’ depredations, I turned to the Daoist priests for incitement.\n\nCareless storage invites theft—though the cave’s gate had no lock, all was sent to the authorities, and the thieves were swiftly imprisoned. Without concealment, their confessions were thoroughly examined. Fortunately, the axes had not yet rotted, and half the trees remained in the moat’s ruins. Seeing a pig in the rain was auspicious, easing the neighbors’ clamor; bearing the cangue to erase their ears was ominous, yet they were spared the flogging of the marketplace. The mountain bandits shivered by the roadside; the tree spirits rejoiced south of the city. Had the worthy magistrate not pitied the sound of chopping, the unruly mob would have felled them day after day.\n\nNow I reverently meet one whose name graces the immortal registers, whose home lies near the banners of the forest. Your lineage, like the three sophoras, stands ready to bear the sky as pillars; your aspirations, like the five willows, bloom across the county. You cherish talent even in the smallest sapling, fearing the mountains and forests might harbor the shame of a Tong Dian. Dismembering these wall-piercing rats is more ingenious than the bean-eating chickens—let alone ascending to immortality atop the cypress. It is enough to make the people of Tongxiang love me.\n\nI, clinging to the tree like a fool, feel shame at gathering beans, hoping to fully clear the hedges, dreading only the increasing threat of the blade. Summoning the thief-handlers to call up five hundred men, I have already [lacuna] the grace of the capital; emulating the recluse who flogged the Qiang, I still rouse the courage of Mount Song. Better to govern oneself than to speak at length.\n\nI thank the county magistrate for sparing the tomb’s camphor trees. The tomb’s trees have grown thick, and all descendants share the sorrow of frost and dew. When Master Carpenter Shi passed by, the magistrate spared them the axe’s calamity. The clan wept in gratitude; even passersby sighed in praise.\n\nI have heard that a magistrate governs the people of a county, often boasting of his peaches and plums. Who lacks ancestors in the Nine Springs? One must carefully protect the pines and catalpas. Thus, the law forbids trampling the heart of the tomb or pacing its bounds; ritual warns against felling trees to build a chamber. Gazing upon my cold clan, dwelling beside the ancestral graves, the sacrifices at the tomb’s edge are conducted in proper attire, a tradition passed down for generations.\n\nBy the river’s edge stands a tree, its shape like a carriage canopy, ten spans in girth. The geomancers say its shade brings benefit; the younger generation hopes for success in the examinations. But my foolish brother, gambling with dice, brought no profit, leading greedy brokers to offer the trees to the authorities. Though the owner is gone, the deed remains—a white contract of twenty-seven years.",

      "translated_text": "The spirits come and go unseen, delivering tens of thousands in bronze as tribute. How unbearable the fraud of carving wood to forge documents—all to spare the ancient camphor at the cost of a life. The pines, revived by cinnabar, might as well carry Lü Dongbin’s ink basket. The lychee trees, preserved by the old woman, still bear the sword marks of Huang Chao.\n\nHere, I humbly encounter one whose heroic standards tower over the ravines, whose steadfast strength upholds the heavens. The hall’s beams await the right timber; the mountain town’s zithers seek the aura of treasure. Firewood is sold in the market, dust gathers in the cooking pot—never mingling with the common folk. The great wind howls, battering the heavy gates; how can the masses be made to see?\n\nThus, I sought a mighty *jia* tree, erecting it in lofty splendor, renewing the spectacle for ten thousand eyes—how could I begrudge the expense of a thousand gold? The walls of this pavilion may serve for offerings, for none escape the vigilance of Huang Ba’s spirit. My son, like a tiger, has perished—he will not falter in the might of Mount Tai. The peach trees, though planted, remain untouched; the cassia, though hewn, bears no scar.\n\nIf not for one who tends the household, who would bestow such blessings? Certain vines and creepers stir in dreams, their roots knowing their origin. I think of the Duke of Shao beneath the sweet pear’s shade—how dare I forget his legacy of uncut grace? Beneath the withered tree, a Daoist is painted; deep roots may yet secure long life.\n\nI, a humble clerk, dined at the governor’s table, returning home late. Forced to preside over banquets, how could I endure the burden? Holding the prefectural decree, I sensed the approach of duty; stepping into the courtyard, I offered my thanks.\n\nI have heard that mountains and rivers gain weight by the people who dwell there, that bells and drums rise and fall with the times. Behold Zhang and Ge’s twin altars, recorded as blessed lands of the realm; Chen and Huang, two scholars, ranked among the Daoist officials of the Zhenghe era. Predecessors and successors alike led with virtue, their inner and outer designs complete.\n\nYet how the present age diverges from those of old! The wickedness of the stubborn and foolish floods the heavens; the wind of purity and stillness is swept away. Autumn fields yield no grain, leaving the midday steamer to gather dust. Daoist hats and alms bowls fill the air, yet officials gape like fledglings awaiting food. Though plows and hoes receive rain, farmers must beg for grain to sustain their work. Granary taxes remain half-unpaid, while county levies are collected in advance. Debts pile like mountains, deep-rooted corruption festers. Only those of keen insight and resolve can manage the searing trials above and below.\n\nAs for me—my nature is meager, my learning unremarkable. I wandered aimlessly in the four directions, occasionally keeping company with elders. Leaning on my staff, I explored the caves of Guilin; pushing aside the reeds, I read the stele by the Wu River. In the eighth month, I watched the tide, often leaning on the riverside tower. At midnight, I drafted dispatches against the northern foe. I visited the shrine of the Sea God at Hailing, drank at the tomb of the Banished Immortal at Caishi. Riding a donkey, I sought the old man Zhao; summoning cranes, I paid homage to West Mountain. Ascending the clear waters of the Yu, I climbed the solitary peak; scaling Red City, I gazed upon the cypress and cedar. My boat drifted on Mirror Lake’s moonlit waves; my cup floated on the winding stream’s current.\n\nLying in bed, I reflected on my life—my tracks have circled the realm. Returning to my old retreat, my hut now stands at the clouds’ edge. Official documents fill the shelves; elixir herbs line the walls. Content to grow old here, I seek nothing more.\n\nI know that cassia halls and bamboo palaces stand tall near the imperial city, that stone altars and flowered courtyards dot the land of robes and sashes. Since heaven harbors no foolish immortals, why should the world tolerate babbling fools? They value rank; I value righteousness. All are drunk; I alone am sober.\n\nThen came the summons—my name drawn from the register, submitted to the authorities. The brush’s dot marked my fate, consigning me to my homeland. Though I craved the honor of a discerning gaze, I broke the vow of a humble life. Scarcely had the first drops of time passed before I was bound to service, often sighing as I tended to my wounds. My learning is insufficient—how can I uphold the standards of civility? My abilities are dull—surely I will fail in both public and private duties. Not only will I shame the chrysanthemum sacrifices, but I will also stain the peach and plum.\n\nHere, I humbly encounter one whose name ranks high among the imperial scholars, whose position graces the purple halls. As vice-prefect, you govern the wilds, your might subduing the foxes and hares of a thousand villages. As magistrate of Xiao and Zhu, your transformative influence tames the fish and swine of three districts. You shatter the heads of demons with a mere clerk’s mark; the female drought-demon falls victim to a year of famine. Loving the people as your children, you transport grain across the river. Through relief, you revive Qingzhou—your hidden virtue rivals that of the noble Fu. Through generosity, you welcome the humble—your magnanimity surpasses even that of the Duke of Zhou.\n\nThus, even a recluse from the mountains and forests may find a place at the sacrificial table, a crane in dark robes mistaken for a fly in ink. How dare I not, alongside my books, purify myself in the springs and rocks? Perhaps then, in my stillness, the people will be upright; in my old age, the young will find peace. May you enjoy wealth, longevity, and many sons—from Hua’s borders, I offer blessings to the emperor. May harmony and joy in office be sung in praise of the Ministry of Revenue.\n\nI fear that if I hasten to join the ranks of the stars, I will suddenly lose the support of your two heavens. In my devotion and reliance, I have laid bare my heart.",

But my foolish brother, gambling with dice, brought no profit, leading greedy brokers to offer the trees to the authorities. Though the owner is gone, the deed remains—a white contract of twenty-seven years.",

      "translated_text": "A Reply to Vice Prefect Zhao of Linjiang\n\nA crane in dark robes had barely glimpsed the muddied carriage-pole when a pair of fish—your letter on silk—suddenly arrived at my mountain door. Its lines gleamed bright as brocade, its gifts rained down like blessings. I read and reread without weariness, moved and enlightened in equal measure.\n\nI once thought those of lofty conduct shunned kings and lords, that immortals wandered only through the dust of markets. Yet when I hid my southward flight on Huading Peak, noble guests came unbidden; when Lü Dongbin appeared in Yueyang, the people failed to recognize him. As for dwelling in mountains while engaging the world, or stepping beyond the city walls to present oneself—so much of life has already been lost. How could one meeting restore what was?\n\nRecently, I heard you had been honored with a palanquin and returned in a cavalcade of riders. Though I am no Daoist master in yellow cap, how could I neglect the rites of suburban welcome? Though you descend to a scholar of humble cottage, I beheld the stature of one who stands like a mountain. My humble verses chirp like crickets or buzz like flies; my homeward dreams are of deer asleep and pheasants perched. Never did I expect such singular favor, such an honor as your fragrant letter. I carved the Heart Sutra and inscribed admonitions by night’s quiet breath, truly sharing the same essence as the sages of West Mountain. You handed me brush and ink—how could I unravel the profound thoughts of Yang Xiong?\n\nThe woven banana-leaf cloth passed lightly as five-zhu coins; the cassia-scented wine fermented in a single flask. When the provincial inspector sent gifts, all travelers marveled. I, a weary wanderer of rivers and lakes, have idly occupied the realm of springs and rocks. Fortunate to rely on you in this place, who else would speak for me?\n\nAmong the literary men of the imperial court, who would feel kinship with one in feathered cloak? Among the woodcutters on the road ahead, who would find leisure in straw sandals? I await your inspection tour, hoping to show my deepest respect.\n\nBoth the scholar and the woodcutter appear in your letter.\n\nTo Prefect Zhang of the Nearby Prefecture, Minister of Personnel\n\nThe silver hare governs the pasture; you honor the famous mountains within your borders. Children on bamboo horses welcome the new magistrate, calling back the lone crane from the clouds. Roads were cleared to await your arrival like Jia Yimin’s; passes were guarded with the reverence of Yin Xi for Laozi. All vied to be first in greeting—etiquette dictates that congratulations come before all else.\n\nI respectfully consider your name renowned throughout the cosmos, your learning bridging heaven and humanity. Your ancestors’ tablets and your father’s robes have been inscribed on Wild Goose Pagoda for generations; your ministerial seals and scholar’s satchels have made you preeminent at Dragon Gate in this age. The emperor declared you a worthy successor and appointed you Academician. You compiled records in the imperial archives and participated in the rigorous evaluations of the Ministry of Personnel. Though clad in plain cloth, you retired from court, only to be entrusted with a new mandate. Your administrative brilliance outshone even Shen Yue’s embroidered robes; your morning sails swelled with the tide at Xiao Shoals. With five horses and no trace of gray hair, you are still in your prime. Linked to the two Lius and the three Kongs, you personally inherit their legacy. Your governance has brought such peace that I await the composition of poems celebrating harmony.\n\nYet I reflect on the people’s hardship: though the records show abundant harvests, taxes are levied by the acre, nearly exhausting the rice and millet of the southern fields. You seek paper mulberry along the clear river and search for pollia on fragrant isles. Old and new debts alike are treated lightly, while both public and private coffers stand empty. Without a hand swift as thunder, how could one implement policies to revive the nation? A pair of brushes has already begun to transform customs; though you stand but a foot and a half from heaven, you swiftly recommend the worthy to high office.\n\nI humbly recall my own escape from Confucian pursuits early on, my slow progress on the Dao. I have not yet prepared the cauldron for the nine refinements, yet rashly ascended the halls of the venerable elders. I once served under military tents, handling shields and ink for dispatches; at the Golden Gate, I composed imperial responses by the light of a rush lamp. Fortunate to have requested and received the most leisurely post, I should have shut my gate and slept soundly. Instead, I mistakenly heeded the calls of my homeland’s people and was nominated to fill an empty seat. External pressures led to internal strife; how could I stand by and do nothing?\n\nWhy should I cling to this cap, when you, my lord, value my lingering presence? Others may draw their bows, but my juniors inevitably follow, jostling for advantage. I watch for your banner to halt, trusting in your clear judgment. In Yueyang, I paid respects to Zijing—not daring to be dazzled by the medicine in his gourd. Like Quan Jiao encountering Yingwu, I hope only to gather firewood from the valley floor.\n\nIn admiration and gratitude, I inscribe these words without restraint.\n\nTo Chief Prosecutor Xiao Dazhuo",

      "translated_text": "Having long heard of your esteemed name, I had planned to pay my respects at the Prosecutor’s Terrace, only to find your reclusive dwelling seemingly unoccupied—leaving me deeply ashamed before the clouds and peaks. I hastily composed this humble offering, though I fear it may offend your solemn dignity.\n\nFor I have heard that noble and base alike may share the stable of ox and steed, and that dragons and serpents arise from deep mountains and vast marshes. Though the natures of things differ tenfold or a hundredfold, how can the records of history deem them all without merit? A worthy like Yan Ziming would never confine himself to Yan’s chamber, nor would a scholar like Zilu remain idle at Confucius’ gate. Now, with your royal splendor adorning these woods and ponds, the very grasses and trees seem to swell with imperial qi.\n\nThe immortals are not far—only the golden lock need be unlatched. Chariots and horses have been seen, yet they need not plunge deep into the reeds. I shrink from the heat of those who flaunt their robes, and laugh at the madness of those who knock on gates like the reckless magistrate. Though my tattooed words may blur, my tongue remains sharp. Yet when I glimpsed your five-flowered judgment splitting the hall, I nearly made our teaching as light as a single leaf. Those petty disputes of sparrows and rats may weary even a judge like the Duke of Shao, but when dragons’ heads and pigs’ bellies gather to compose poetry, is there ever a lack of talent like Mi Ming?\n\nOverwhelmed by my own ignorance, I am almost compelled to heed the call to approach. I reverently consider your eminence: a pillar of Confucian learning, a scholar of vast erudition, a talent fit to serve the throne. You continue the legacy of the Tang chancellors, where even Yu nearly matched their stature, and rival the heroes of the Han, where I cannot compare. Having ascended the ranks of Penglai’s pure halls, you now wield the stern authority of the Censorate. When you deign to inspect the provinces, famine-stricken multitudes are saved by your grain distributions. Clad in your embroidered robes, at ease in your scholar’s cap, you soar before alighting—your succession a lofty act, your justice reviving the dead, your virtue spreading like a balm.\n\nYou personally review prisoners in the summer heat, rising early to consult widely. Like two stars, you hasten to the sacred altar; like the Five Plains, you draw down rain from the Silver River. No need to brave the perilous rapids of the imperial court—you shall soon stand in the Hall of Illumination.\n\nAs for myself, I am clumsy in self-governance and unknown in the Dao, a wanderer feeding on others’ charity, yet never stooping to the buzzing of flies or the fawning of dogs. Returning to my mountain retreat, I endure the laments of cranes and the startling cries of gibbons. Now, I shake the dust from my books and tend the alchemical furnace. I bar my gate to worldly guests and hold my clay pot among the garden laborers. Though I have heard of your reins being reined in for inspection, I dare not trail my robes to your door.\n\nThe Spring and Autumn’s censures extend even to those like me; who would dare presume upon your favor? Unlike the Three Disciples, I am but a speck of dust—yet if you deign to glance my way, I would exhaust both ends of my meager wit, though I fear I may still share their fate. Is this not a guest’s attempt to deflect mockery? Surely I am not one who delights in argument.\n\nTo the Grain Transport Commissioner:\nYour Excellency’s bridle gleams as you prepare to dispatch the wooden-ox carts of grain, while this humble scholar’s rice pot remains empty—now that you’ve moved the Jade Maiden’s kitchen. I have heard that governing begins with ordering one’s household; here, then, is your chance to observe true administration. Alas, if I must depart, how can I do so without words?\n\nI owe two qing of fields near the city walls, yet I never took joy in the humble lane’s single basket of food. Thus, I set out from the distant frontier, becoming a guest who feeds at the tables of lords. Beyond my gate, the Eastern Lord never starved; atop the mountain, Du Fu was ever lean. I have endured the bitterness of cold scraps and stale meat, and long since resolved to return to my early leeks and late millet. You were transferred from the capital to the provinces, while I, the guest, was driven away only to return.\n\nBeating the drum and roasting fresh meat, I marveled at my luck in meeting such an auspicious day. Yet gaping like a fledgling awaiting food, I did not realize the hour had passed noon. To cleanse the people’s eyes and ears, your decrees may seem too harsh—yet if you burden others with their bellies’ demands, which weighs heavier in propriety? Even if you bound ten armfuls of reeds, how many ladles could they hold? How can I endure the rumbling thunder of a sky without mercy, or idly watch the sun standing tall upon the earth?\n\nIf not for the brush of the clerk, who would pity the prince’s plight? Once the bean broth is secured, life persists; though coarse fare is easily prepared. Yet if you recall the beggar at the eastern gate, my manners were lacking—though I entrusted the cooking to the kitchen, where care is naturally taken. How could I have expected the whip to fall upon the carriage attendants? Though one may \"throw the rat without fear,\" the shock of striking the duck is far greater.\n\nWhen the wine did not reach me, Gongrong bore no grudge—yet he still distinguished between kin and stranger. When sweet wine was forgotten, Mu Sheng departed at once—knowing well the time to leave. If you still harbor affection for the beans, you only deepen the mockery of \"hewing sandalwood.\" I humbly consider your eminence: endowed with celestial brilliance, inheriting your ancestors’ noble legacy, content with simple fare for yourself, yet sharing others’ joys and sorrows. You once led a million troops with oil-bannered tents to Lian River, and your retinue of three thousand pearl-shod guests rivaled Lord Chunshen’s.\n\nIf you momentarily forgot your own hunger, it was not that you failed to share your food. Your caution in conduct still reflects distinctions—better to have no petty quarrels to trouble others than to lack the bold, unyielding knights who would rally to me. Permit me to depart henceforth, and graciously allow my return. Awakened by the millet dream, I renounce the wealth of Handan; nourished by the blue elixir, I shall roam Liang and Song instead. With my calling card still in hand and my baggage packed, I ask the way.\n\nTo Inspector Taiyi of Wudu:\nThe lamps of Taiyi shine brightly, and I, unworthy, have joined the elders. Su Shi’s embankment lies near, and I have sought the Three Worthies. This may serve as a temporary refuge, though critics may scorn it as a secluded valley.\n\nI have learned that your mastery of the law rivals Jin Meng’s ferocity, and your poetry continues the Tang legacy. You summoned the Rain Master in the dead of night, honored with an ivory tablet; you grasped the sun’s essence in your left hand, its light overflowing the black wheel. Not only have you perfected the prayers of the temple, but you have also attained the subtleties of alchemical refinement. As we compose matching verses in joy, I recall that partings and meetings have their time.\n\nYour grand compositions and generous gifts humble me, like a rabbit’s burrow beside your splendor, or a swallow’s nest borrowed at dusk. If you call the Perfected One’s lotus-leaf boat, perhaps you might visit me; if you continue the Recluse’s plum-blossom verses, you shall surely surpass me. My gratitude resides in my heart, though my thanks may never fully appear on my face.",

      "translated_text": "To the Right Street Supervisor of Ritual Propriety, Xie Tiju,\n\nReturning to my vegetarian residence, I merely follow the old path; the rites completed at the palace, I am now assigned to the initial post. Truly, official rank and insignia must not be lent to others—what have wealth and nobility to do with me? To refuse the imperial decree would be shameless indeed.\n\nI reflect that I possess no skills, only a stubborn temperament. With a pure heart, I dwell alone, finding it difficult to seek the intimacy of teachers and friends; though my hair has turned white, I have returned once more, never abandoning the righteousness between sovereign and subject. Your generous gifts repeatedly fill my chests and baskets, and your literary compositions often reach the imperial gaze. Unworthy of the sovereign’s grace, I fortunately encountered the ancestral sacrifices. Amidst the myriad blossoms clustering the imperial procession, I beheld the splendor of the celestial retinue; with a single decree issued in the court, I suddenly found myself selected among the Daoist officials. In matters of administration, I am tasked with the minutiae of rice and salt; as a ritual master, I wield talismanic water to channel the numinous. Who would have thought this dullard could stand among such esteemed company?\n\nThis is all due to your reverence for the Dao and compassion: pitying one who has come from afar, my title remains unchanged; unwilling to let even a single man weep, my footsteps ascend alongside others. Once I heard of the great strategist; now I see the lofty practitioner of austerities. My arms grow weak and nearly useless, my purse empty and unworthy of scrutiny. Without money, nothing moves—like the hare’s plea for hemp to patch its burrow. With books to read, I can only beg to return home, my bones as frail as a turtle’s.\n\n**From the Director of the Taiyi Palace, Xie Tiju,**\n\nWith a clear mind and simple affairs, I strictly adhere to the rules of vegetarian residence. Though the favor is weighty, my standing is slight, and I overstep in managing palace affairs. While my memorials ascend swiftly, my talents are meager and untrained.\n\nI privately consider that the divine abode you oversee ranks foremost before the throne, and the Daoist tradition is revered as if in the heavens. Yet in recent years, it has strayed from its former reputation: neither benevolent nor profound, it has lost the joy of Zhuangzi’s bridge; whether like Zang or Gu, all indulge in gambling games. Those who read the *Huangting Jing* miswrite many characters; those who annotate the *Zhouyi* scarcely apply their red ink. They learn cunning in the marketplace but cultivate solitude in the court. To stem this decline, steadfast resolve is essential.\n\nAs for myself, I know my body is afflicted, yet I seek nothing from the world. Having been summoned back to my hometown, I was again called to the capital. Forsaking the near for the distant, I vied to see the newly inscribed imperial brush; relinquishing honor for humility, I preserved only my old felt mat. Emulating the frugality of a bamboo basket and gourd ladle in a narrow alley, I long for the bamboo shoots and ferns of spring mountains. The expenses multiply, filling the gaps in my robes and collars. When asked what I desire, I shake my head and lodge a formal complaint. Those who know me ask what I seek—face to face, I receive only boundless favor.\n\nHow could I presume to stand above others, yet find myself placed west of the abbot’s quarters? Taking on trivial duties in my leisure, I have already lost my original intent. To leave would be to linger; to stay would be a misguided plan.\n\nThis is all due to the exemplary conduct of my predecessors, whose skeletal frames resembled those of emaciated immortals. The cinnabar warms the three elixir fields, yet they do not rely on youthful medicines; incense lingers in their chambers as they leisurely peruse the scriptures at dawn. Adorned with vermilion bows and fox-fletched arrows, they serve the sovereign; praying at osmanthus halls and bamboo palaces, they protect the realm. All who don the feathered robes share in the spring breeze of your guidance.\n\nHow dare I not wash my hands and serve the public, leading with an upright demeanor? I shall strive to repay the blessings of my austerities and weigh the propriety of advancement and retreat. Though I know my current appointment is undeserved, I cannot defy the sovereign’s command. I hope to resign next year, allowing this recluse to return home.\n\n**To Xu Shukuan, in Gratitude for His Visit,**\n\nI lowered Chen Fan’s couch, long admiring your household; you visited Yang Xiong’s pavilion, suddenly arriving at my humble abode. I regret we did not become friends sooner, yet you honored me with such earnest courtesy.\n\nI reflect that you were born where twin swords harbor spirits, your five carts laden with books. Your understanding of things is lucid and bright; with hands clasped, you compose verses effortlessly. Borne by the whirlwind, you lament that plucking your beard came late. You have savored the flavors of pickled vegetables and salt from your satchel, and carried your staff to admire the wonders of mountains and rivers. Though impoverished, your resolve only strengthens; no power can bend you.\n\nYou take \"reverence, magnanimity, trustworthiness, diligence, and kindness\" as your courtesy name, facing the purple catalpa together. Among the worthy and talented, you ascend, climbing the cinnamon branches side by side.\n\nI, who dwell in the mountains and grow old, see few visitors at my door. Yet I hold your magnificent compositions, recognizing the refined guest before me. Yang Shi’s words for me are apt—I surely avoid the criticism of plucking a hair for the world’s benefit. Xu You’s son recites the line about turning back to astonish guests. My song is never enough; a brief stay would be best.\n\n**To Zou Yuanshu, in Thanks for the Meal Token,**\n\nWhen grain distribution reached the mountains, I followed the sprouts to the upper fields; when the token was issued from the treasury, it provided meals for the master. This shows not only your compassion for a guest but also your reverence for a teacher. The provisions have been long in place; my gratitude is overdue.\n\nI reflect that you possess vast \"paper fields\" and have inherited the \"seeds of books.\" Fearing to enter Chang’an and boil cinnamon, how could I accept coarse rations? Your disciples have served for years—some mock the ease of following a master, while others, as great men unable to feed themselves, fittingly receive food to stave off hunger. Though different from Mencius’ nourishment of Zhong, I avoid Yan Hui’s cooking. The general is not yet old, and his followers are all inspired.\n\nToday, a single bowl of rice is casually scooped from the clouds; in the future, five tripods of delicacies will surely be presented to the honored guest.\n\nI have long borne the burden of an empty granary, occasionally opening an old shop. I sigh for the fallen beans of my mountain while envying the millet growing in your valley. My mother, fond of scorched pots, finds joy in my return; my brother, due to a tilted cauldron, incurred the resentment of a twisted arm. The couch is put away once more, though the new branches remain.\n\n**To Lin, Administrator of the White Cloud Abbey on Maoshan,**\n\nThe couch is hung again, shaming the green grass before the hall; your letter arrives from afar, having parted with the white clouds on the ridge. Reading it in the heat, the breeze is most refreshing.\n\nI reflect that you early shed the scholar’s robe, boldly seeking the elixir of return. Your words become poetry, your speech untouched by worldly smoke and fire. When the Dao prevails, you wander among men, forming bonds over porridge and rice. By chance, you encountered great armies and famine years, briefly relying on your elder sister beneath the bright moon.\n\nI await a single letter, ready to tread the paths of both streets.",

      "translated_text": "My years now wane, worldly flavors all grown thin—I cannot bear to while away my days in office, yet my playful wanderings remain among men. I move backward in my ways, recognizing only the characters of Ziyun; should you laugh at me, we might together seek the plums of Hejing.\n\n**To Zhou Ziru, who urges me to write poetry,**\nI receive word of your transcendental journey—would you deign to visit this cloud-sealed retreat? Our dust-trailing conversation confirms you are no empty scholar; the scroll as thick as an ox’s waist, you say, is the work of a great master. You send me a pair of matched letters, humbly demanding my mediocre verses. I beg to be as pure as cold-water jade—how could I repay you with a lute of green silk? Though the *Three Hundred Poems* are many, what use are they? They only burden your servants, Hong Ya and Ge Duo.\n\nMy mother, at seventy, clings to me as our sole bond; I recall with longing our home beneath Song Gao’s peaks, with its persimmons and chestnuts. My poor lines shame me—they cannot do justice to your grandeur. I read them with a flick of my spittoon, then overturn the sauce jar without a doubt.\n\n**To Lei Yinglei,**\nHaving retired to a secluded ravine, you are an exile beyond the court; presenting two chapters, you are a fervent guest knocking at the gate. When asked your age, you were born in the *gengchen* year—the same year Old Quan read his books, the same year Kangjie awaited his son. Your lofty recitations brook no delay—why doubt their far reach? Tell the boy to step out and test the clarity of your *lei*-zither; walk beside me, and soon you’ll vie with the jade pendants of immortals.\n\n**To Scholar Wang, who came to visit,**\nYou arrived with poems tucked in your sleeve, and I lamented our late acquaintance; I welcomed you with wine, only to hear of your broken arm’s misfortune. Sacred mountains are not easily reached—how fortunate that such a fine guest deigned to arrive in quick succession! I had hoped for clouds to part over Mount Heng, but the path at Stonehead proved treacherous. For though my writing flows as swiftly as a flick of the wrist, my official post bore the omen of a broken arm. Baring my right shoulder, I imagine the cost of a skilled physician’s salves; wielding the crab’s claw with my left hand, I must still manage the old man’s affairs.\n\n**To Daoist Zeng, seeking lodging,**\nThree letters to the court—what need for a poetry satchel? Six verifications to return to the hall—present your meal alms. Even if clouds drift from the peaks without intent, can one enter the mountains empty-handed? Though old acquaintances are many, the pure rules must not be disordered. If you set out as a wandering monk, I fear your fellow lodgers will carve you up; bring your ordination certificate, and you may stay like the crane by the river. I hope for your kind favor—my gratitude runs deep.\n\n**To Attendant Zhao, who sent a management writ,**\nTo end disputes and embrace old age, I sought to change past practices; to seek retirement and receive promotion—this was never my true aim. A painted curtain worth a thousand gold, a knock at the gate startling as two jades cast down. Ancient cedars tremble, stubborn stones are shaken. Long weary of flight like a bird, how much more exhausted are the tricks of the flying squirrel? At the crossroads, I already regret my lost way; on the hundred-foot pole, how can I advance further? No silver could buy my return, nor could the military treasury store my resolve. Tearing open the letter of Luoyang’s elders, I hope you see that I am no proud Yaofu; declining the rice of my hometown’s youths, I beg to emulate Jiejie’s early retreat. I offer a modest reply—pray, take pity on my condition.\n\n**To Scholar Nie,**\nReturning home in black robes, you stole the brocade of night-walking thieves; casting pearls to the ground, who would embroider the skirt of a day-sleeping scholar? By chance, a dream-flight to the immortals led me to breach etiquette in receiving a guest. I recall your name resounding in the north, your fame echoing across the southern lakes. Scholar of three ears, I remember our past exchanges; Guanyin of a thousand hands, I regret my failure to detain you. We never fulfilled our promise of wine and literary discourse—only the moon’s fall through the rafters deepens my longing. When mitre and shoes meet cassock, may we reunite in harmony; when boots and robes meet the hand-tablet, may you soon ascend in glory.\n\n**To Vice-Palace Zhang, congratulating him on his title,**\nGhosts and ants jostle together, mistakenly made leaders of twin altars; immortals and dragons fortunately gather, jointly granted the grace of nine-tiered courts. Not that our teaching lacks men, but this fills a gap in the mountain’s rites. I hear you are adept at managing affairs, your auxiliary labors profound. You journeyed to the court to submit a memorial, hoping to wash armor in the Yellow River; sitting on stone, you composed verses, content to transcribe clouds with your alms bowl. Your grand compositions dazzle old eyes. I have no private motives—only the public good. Purple decrees and yellow hemp, by chance you’ve achieved merit in a day; plain letters and green bamboo slips still rely on the praise of all quarters.\n\n**To Manager Chen,**\nMy pines and bamboos age late, my bonds of friendship endure many years. Striking bamboo to harmonize with dancing songs, I seek immortals on high; sleeping in clouds to decline the vermilion summons, I carry on the ancestral tradition afar. Amid the clamor of welcoming banners and gongs, you bestow verses resonant as metal and stone. My hair is now snow, my brush no longer like a rafter. An old horse treated as a colt—I deeply regret the errors of the Six States; later men gathering fruit—how many are as round as the Nine Treasuries’ coins?\n\n**To Lecturer Huang,**\nMy good heart is still water, my lecturing tongue stirs the wind. Reading the *Yi*, I attained a wife—privately I scorned the dragon-slaying son-in-law; entering the mountains, I met stubborn stone—personally I saw the sheep-herding elder. Your seven-character poems boast of my two virtues. My name was made through slander, my affairs through resolve. The imperial command renews—you humble yourself before Yangzi’s scales; the ancestral tradition may yet flourish—strive to inherit the robe and bowl of Master Tan.\n\n**To Supervisor Wang,**\nMy heart dwells in the cultivation of the Dao—my secondary concern is discussing warfare.",

      "translated_text": "Extending the prose of lone wild duck and autumnal glow, my body grows accustomed to roaming South Bank; receiving the Seven-Star Sword to slay demons, my lineage directly connects to the Hall of Madness. Delighted by the grand canon’s divine ordinance, you composed a new ode and bestowed it upon me. I, by chance, have gathered affairs—long have I hindered the worthy. The two kings after Zhang—how they evoked the lament of untapped talent; the one Fan in the army—still we witness his triumphant merit. Again assuming official duties, I return to report to Minister Chen of the Mountains and Streams. The Supreme Heaven’s Noble Spirit, I bow in parting from the incense and flame of the Bamboo Palace; the green felt is my old possession, awakening the mist and clouds of Mount Ge’s peaks.\n\nThe crowd mocks my expulsion and return—who recognizes the letting go and holding fast? My friends, steadfast as glue and lacquer, bestow upon me the favor of pearls and jades in verse. Roads crumble, carriages overturn in gorges, boats capsize—truly the human heart is hard to fathom. Water severs dragons, land cleaves hides—only my strength yet endures. Do not stand idle as a bystander; rather, open your sincerity and offer loyal counsel.\n\n**Reply to Censor Zhao Urging Spring’s Arrival**\nThe embroidered robe stands in the celestial spring—renewal has its day; the jeweled pagoda crowns the stupa’s tip—your grace towers like heaven. My humble words, though unworthy, hasten forth; I await with clasped hands your renewed decree. Privately I examine the Selection Bureau’s statutes—none are stricter than the举贤 of the Censorate. Several prefectures, countless officials, all depend on your seal; every case, every lawsuit, scrutinized for their duties. Though the crowd may be sharp as blades, they must emerge from my gate. Who, licking the elixir of Huainan’s *Hongbao*, lacks the glow of alchemy? Who, having received Ji Bu’s golden vow, would dare break faith?\n\nDeeply I consider: my learning is shallow, my father’s teachings scant, my talent unfit for the tent of men. Only the imperial edict do I fear; fortunately, my teeth and hair remain strong. Can I not labor? The affairs of a foolish son remain unfinished. Yet in advancing, I know well the elder’s truth. I shall await your light carriage in welcome, even as I cherish my humble broom. Examine the nine-fathom spring in the abandoned well; draw but a ladle’s water from the West River. Why this delay? I await only the first month’s proclamation of the bell. Service presses so urgently—lest I fear the midnight boat’s departure. Ceasing my endless chatter, I renew my earnest threefold plea.\n\n**Respectfully considering you:**\nYour reputation for fairness is long-established, your lineage flows from the Luo and Yi. Applying the strategies of kings and the decisions of states, entrusted with the duty of illuminating punishments and adjudicating cases, you traverse the Zhou plains in inspection—even the *que* stones remain steadfast. Leaning your long sword atop Kongtong’s peak, the rats submit; suspending your bright mirror before Fanggao’s gaze, the herd of horses vanishes. Since your assent is never lightly given, your search for talent is nearly exhaustive.\n\nI, unworthy, dwell in your kinship’s register, aspiring to stand within your master’s gate. As governance’s spirit resides in that single point, so too, with a feather’s insertion, one swiftly ascends. First honor the ancestral covenant, then the bonds of other surnames—only in great creation is there completion. Awaiting a state’s knight to repay the common crowd—this is not a humble student’s dare. My devotion is most earnest; how could I exhaust my supplications?\n\n**Reply to Minister Shi, Military Commissioner, on Recommendation**\nHoisting the commander’s banner, opening the commissioner’s frontier, the great river equally bears the emperor’s mandate; grasping the prime minister’s robe, recounting our familial years, even the humble grass prostrates upon the ground of favor. Gazing up from the dust of my lowly station, I behold the stars of your resplendent seat. Forgetting rank and dignity, I present my sincerity and distress.\n\nPrivately I examine the dragon-and-tiger lists of successive dynasties—though they boast many scholars, those who attain the wild geese’s formation in both families, three men each, are rare indeed. The three-legged cauldron stands by the Jiang’s Kong; the terrace links Hong of the Fan waters. Among those who vie in boasting their excellence, who deepens the pact of shared ascent? Through my late father and two elders, we are bound to the same gate. Half a prefect, I once accompanied guests up Yu Gu; our loftiest bond was beneath the embroidered tent. Now the prime minister visits his kin along the Pen’s banks—how graciously you deign to glance upon my vermilion screen!\n\nThe *Book* says: \"In affection like brothers, though surnames differ\"—perhaps your kindness extends to descendants without end. Yet the distinction between dragon bones and swine is clear; thus the soaring of roc and wren diverge. To speak when one may—this is to advance.\n\n**Humbly reflecting:**\nMy capacity is but a dou or shao, my thread of talent short. The lock responds to my name, barely achieving the effect of treading the scholar’s tree; the thorn enclosure’s test still awaits, hoping for the transmission of the ivory tablet. By chance I was touched by your beneficent rain, thus bound in this minor office. Reading the collections of Jingguo and Linchuan, I visited the *Wenxuan* tower of Xiaozhou. A noble person desires my emergence from your gate—how undeservedly I am drawn forth! A foolish son awaits the completion of your affairs—undaunted by toil.\n\nEarnestly I gnaw the bitter herb and drink the ice, gazing toward the cinnabar and plaster. In selection’s release, nothing is harder than the blade’s edge; in seeking divine aid, I have knocked at the courtyard of the Cai. Personally I hasten to repay swiftly, moved by your solemn vow. Receiving your lofty mandate in haste, I enhance the humble office’s glory.\n\nRather than clutching Lord Liu’s book while foul and fragrant share the same vessel, better to elicit Master Bo’s inquiry—peach and plum trees form a path. Perhaps through the washing of the ten-thousand-stone’s robes, I may joyfully wield a thousand gold’s broom.\n\n**Respectfully considering you:**\nEndowed by heaven with profundity, refined by learning to loftiness, your body resides on the sandy embankment—accustomed to the phoenix pond’s robes and bowls; your measure vast as the ocean, calmly swallowing the mirage’s towers. Ten years you did not leave Chang’an; eight seats you ascended as minister of state. With border beacons ablaze, the river’s surface should remain unruffled. Applying the model of Huai’s banks, you transfer the hand that presses the imperial carriage. Wielding the banner and feather fan, arranging the towered ships, the army’s might resounds in the willow camp—enemy hordes vanish into the grasslands. Easing the ninefold emperor’s cares, you assist the hundred officials’ tasks.\n\nThe father’s beloved son is also beloved—extraordinary scholars have long been welcomed in the eastern pavilion. Where the lord is worthy, the guest must be worthy—even a fool may be taken from the western house. I, relying on your gate’s walls, presumptuously drip my mouse liver, like the cicada’s suitor seeking owl’s roast. I pray you temper your abundant grace, bending to pity this unworthy orphan. Piling humble baskets of earth to form a mountain, I avoid abandoning the fathom-deep spring for the well.",
      "overlap_context": "-slaying son-in-law; entering the mountains, I met stubborn stone—personally I saw the sheep-herding elder. Your seven-character poems boast of my two virtues. My name was made through slander, my affairs through resolve. The imperial command renews—you humble yourself before Yangzi’s scales; the ancestral tradition may yet flourish—strive to inherit the robe and bowl of Master Tan.\n\n**To Supervisor Wang,**\nMy heart dwells in the cultivation of the Dao—my secondary concern is discussing warfare.",

      "translated_text": "Born in the garden of Master Shi, raised among the steeds of Bo Le—why bow and scrape to others when I may attend your lordship’s sandals? The oath of the Wen State hall endures in this world. Gradually I seek to take root and stand firm, to repay the shaping hand of the potter’s wheel.\n\nWhen the royal inspector summoned the recluse from his mountain, he still occupied the seat of the chief minister. Dispatching a messenger to the distant frontier, they hastened his return to the study chamber. Ascending the carriage post was like casting dice to select an official; approaching the palace gate resembled a macaque entering its pouch. By chance I washed away the shame of the hidden valley, or perhaps I invited mockery for taking a shortcut.\n\nHonored with poetic verses, I deeply cherish this bond of friendship. Now, shifting my courtyard to rein in the world’s customs, how dare I encroach upon your seat to answer the visiting star? Compared to the talent of \"eight dou to one dan,\" my words recklessly boast beyond Cao Zijian’s; observing a stature of nine chi and four cun, my achievements should belong to Cao Jiao.\n\nShould we journey east together, we would surely ascend to the heights.\n\n*End of Volume One of the Collected Works of Master Wu Zhai*\n*Volume Two of the Collected Works of Master Wu Zhai*\n\nBy imperial decree, the Reclusive Scholar Yang Zhizhi of Heishan, bearing the title *Right Attendant for the Mirror of Righteousness and Supervisor of Daoist Affairs*, respectfully submits this memorial in gratitude for his appointment to a temple post.\n\nHaving long retired to rustic fields, I dared to bask in the sun of your esteemed summons. Recalled to court, I finally acceded to the temple’s request. My duties, though nominal, bring honor; my stipend, though modest, sustains my poverty. Moved by the emperor’s grace, I humbly express my private gratitude.\n\nI reflect: born in a remote village, my nature is ordinary. While I have long cherished the bonds of teachers and friends, how could I aspire to serve the ruler or benefit the people? Barely repaying my village debts, I still owe my service to the prefectural office. Afflicted by illness, I sought retirement, idly consuming the state’s grain. Though I should have retired by age, I remain attached to this enlightened era.\n\nWhen the sagely emperor personally took the reins to inaugurate a new era, the virtuous were elevated to aid governance. He inquired after scholars, summoning the eight worthies by name. Though I declined the casket’s offer, edicts repeatedly arrived. Phoenixes and swans gathered—permitted to follow in the footsteps of the immortals on Mount Dao—yet my aged hound and horse, too feeble to behold the celestial gates, repeatedly pleaded from within. At last, my earnest pleas were met with compassion. Honored with the Eastern Wall’s books, entrusted with the Central Altar’s incense, I never left my rural home, yet my name was inscribed among the ranks of officials.\n\nWhat weight do I hold in the court of Duke Yu? My old age is doubly burdened by fate. More than satisfied, I call this an encounter with fortune. If I were to compile annotations, I would exhaust my life’s energy. The golden casket’s teachings for my son suffice for family study; the bamboo slips sent to the prefecture were mistakenly summoned for imperial proclamation. Shallow and unworthy, I contribute nothing to glory.\n\nThis is all thanks to your renown resounding across China and beyond, your merits securing the altars of state. You personally embrace the sun of Yu Yuan, calmly dispelling the clouds of the Yellow Road. Like Tang learning from Yi Yin to serve as minister, your virtue truly reaches heaven; like Shun elevating Gao Yao from the multitude, your ancient plans are reaffirmed. Laboring to renew a hundred neglected affairs, with a gesture you advance the careers of all officials. Though I am but a withered remnant, I share in this honor.\n\nHow dare I not strive to witness the Great Peace, prolonging my fading years? I intend to compose praises for the sagely ruler and worthy ministers, joining the joy of yellow-haired elders and white-headed children. Though my back warms in the sun, I still harbor the ambition to offer myself to the lord; though my cap hangs late, I shall follow with a memorial of resignation.\n\n---\n\n*In Gratitude for the Appointment of Zhao Dazi as Maritime Pacification Commissioner*\n\nI reverently note that the imperial court has issued its decree, and the frontier command has stilled its might. Clad in brocade, you return home—four generations hasten to court at the Wei Gate; a soldier strays from his ranks, yet a single word pacifies the crisis within the palace walls. The seas lie calm, and the emperor’s countenance is joyful.\n\nI hold in esteem your brilliance and distinction, your depth and breadth. Who among the world’s talents stands to your right? Deploying the arsenal within your breast, none can withstand you. For a decade along the Yangtze and Huai, through a hundred battles with banners and drums, your strategies severed the Xiongnu’s arm; your laughter brought the head of Zhi Zhi. Great merit blazes on your banners, while you find tranquil delight among springs and rocks.\n\nYet the times are troubled—how could you remain idle long? The land of Shu seems vast; you rouse a zither like Qing Xian. When neighbors quarrel, you astonish them with three arrows like the general. Now, guiding the reins with care, you swiftly lay down your weapons to receive their homage. Were it not for the support of the Luoyang and Shetai officials, one might suspect the Yellow Pool’s soldiers still stir unrest.\n\nOfficials flock to your court; the emperor leans forward in his seat. The Yandui rapids, like elephants, now serve the ships of Eastern Wu; the Wei River’s non-bear omens hasten your grasp of the western pivot’s handle. Quelling the beacon fires at the borders, you strengthen the state’s foundation like a massive boulder.\n\nI, a latecomer from the southern rivers, have yet to tread the imperial avenue. Though I have not ascended the Dragon Gate, how could I bear the chariot’s journey? Reading the green silk dispatches, I marvel at the purple aura. Whose appearance resembles Duke Jin’s? Perhaps I may harmonize with the welcoming party by the roadside. How much grain does the Grand Minister possess? I offer a plan for the Guanzhong region. In celebrating your appointment, I have no more to add.\n\n---\n\n*In Gratitude for the Appointment of Zhao Dazi as Pacification Commissioner of the East*\n\nI reverently note that the azure heavens have bestowed the battle-axe, and the purple palace has transferred the jade bridle. Your seat surpasses the plans Jia Yi once presented. Delaying your morning audience across nine steps, you govern the east of Shaan as the Duke of Zhou did. Seated amidst a thousand peaks, you grandly unfold the tented headquarters’ regulations, secretly conveying blessings to the capital.\n\nI hold in esteem your spirit, born between sea and mountain, a pillar of the imperial house. Your talents and aura are unmatched—none among the mediocre can compare. Your fame resounds; you have swallowed the Xiongnu of the northern frontier whole. Shielding the Yangtze and sheltering the Huai, your strategies are well-ordered; enriching the state and strengthening the army, your merits are resplendent.\n\nOccasionally indulging in the pleasures of Pingquan, you leisurely peruse the maps of Luoshe. The king says, \"Return swiftly!\"—you soothe the apes of Jiange; a soldier strays from his ranks—you quell the hedgehogs of the willow camp. Better to hold a spring purification festival in late spring than cross the Lu River in May.\n\nNow, the imperial edict changes your role, planting you in the imperial homeland. The palace’s celestial foundations extend the emperor’s mandate for ten thousand years; the towers’ cloud-reflected shadows gather the immortals of Penglai’s three islands.",

Having briefly achieved accomplishments in governance and pacification, you swiftly ascend to the inner circle of imperial trust.\n\nI, who have mistakenly heard the morning cock’s crow and thus shared the journey with the imperial carriage, feel shame at having no counsel to offer, and fear only my own negligence and failure. Delighted to hear of your auspicious appointment to open the fief, I am most fortunate to rely upon a neighboring seat as your colleague. Your banners and standards may be glimpsed from afar, and your remedies and stones are ever at hand.\n\nAccompanying the marshal to the suburban pavilion, I can only imagine the gatherings by Mirror Lake; observing the extraordinary scholar retained in the eastern chamber, I still follow in the dust of your company. My admiration is profound, yet my words fail to express it fully.\n\nOn behalf of the congratulatory address to the Grand Supervisor of Huaidong and Military Commissioner of Zhenjiang, Wu the Vice Minister:\n\nI respectfully note that you raise the banner and oversee provisions, holding the satchel and governing the city. Your seals are stacked high, and the imperial envoys rank among the feudal lords; your prestige shines brightly, and your brothers continue the songs of Feng Jun. The offices and prefectures are newly established, and the gentry flourish.\n\nI reverently consider that you, a leading star of the Purple Enclosure, are renowned across the seas. In the realm of heaven and earth, and of ruler and minister, you embody the Dao of the *Great Learning* and the *Doctrine of the Mean*; in literature and governance, you ascend the ranks of the imperial attendants in Chengming Hall. In your youth, you traversed the halls of purity with distinction; with nimble hands, you managed the most complex affairs.\n\nHeaven ordains peace and order, and the emperor seeks counsel. As a high official with two crimson carriages, you do not disdain the Daoist abbeys of Jiangdong; with thirty bushels measured to the peck, you aptly supply the military garrisons of the northern frontier. The lamp of the mind continues the great awakening, and beacon fires cause no alarm at the Willow Camp. With unparalleled talent and spirit, you command the foremost land south of the Yangtze.\n\nWith ample supplies and the people’s trust, swords are returned to oxen and plows. With the Rong and Di at peace, the nation is blessed, and shields are wrapped in tiger skins. Swiftly returning to the ranks of the purple satchels, you ascend directly to the yellow gates of the imperial court.\n\nWe, mere straw and chaff, offer no aid, and our consumption of the state’s grain deepens our shame. Wandering the towers of Beigu, we laugh at the dust of Donghua. Hearing of extraordinary honors, we dare to recount our shared service. The realm praises Wu, and we secretly admire the footsteps of the virtuous officials; the army has its Fan, and we await with eager eyes the deeds of the esteemed lord.\n\nOur joy is profound, yet our words cannot fully express it.\n\nOn behalf of the congratulatory address to Wei the Vice Director of the Zhexi Judicial Commission:\n\nI respectfully note that you have been selected for the bamboo ranks and entrusted with the embroidered tally. Within the five hundred *li* of the royal domain, you serve as commanded, east or west; for thirty years of state expenditure, paper currency rises and falls with the times. Upon dispatch, you are given strategies for adaptability, and your authority to inspect and supervise is enhanced. The starry carriage moves forth, and the springs flow without obstruction.\n\nI reverently consider that your aspirations are vast and your demeanor warm and composed. Near at hand, you serve your father; afar, you serve your lord, deeply embodying the teachings of the *Ya* and *Song* in the Four Poems. Above, you govern the inner court; below, you govern the outer realm, penetrating the sentiments of the military across ten thousand *li*. Your colored tassels have passed through the ranks of the phoenix and egret; your weapons are already entrusted to the orchid-scented armory. You have plucked the osmanthus of the broad moon and now continue the *Wenxi* poems. The hall is built of white jade, awaiting the unfolding of imperial decrees; gold is as common as dust, and no one precedes you in rescuing the state’s currency.\n\nEven the inquiries of the Han envoys would be swiftly answered, revealing the abundance of the Zhou dynasty. Directly within the emperor’s library of maps and books, your radiance is not obscured; emptying the prisons of the common people, you align with the enlightened directives. Swiftly summoned to the emperor’s side, you are further honored with the intimacy of a trusted advisor.\n\nI, who once attended court with you, now share in your governance. The memories of our companionship are vivid, and the sentiments of parting linger. The chaff of my insignificance lies before me; how dare I recall the old days of resting beneath the scholar’s tree? Yet, like grass and trees to me, your fragrance endures—do not forget the loyalty of your medicinal teachings.\n\nMy admiration is boundless, yet my words are cut short.\n\nOn behalf of the congratulatory address to Vice Minister Shi, Governor of Pingjiang and concurrently Supervisor:\n\nI respectfully note that you have been honored with an imperial appointment and transferred to govern Wumen. Your virtuous standards stir the wind, continuing the footsteps of the imperial robes; the halls are bright by day, and the painted halberds echo with pure recitations. The offices and prefectures are renewed, and officials and people rejoice together.\n\nI reverently consider that your spirit is pure and your virtue vast. From a family of eight generations of renown, you inherit the ivory tablets of the imperial court; with a single classic, you teach your sons, secretly transmitting the lamp of Daoist learning. Even when Wendou was upon your knee, you mastered Chen Ping’s strategies for governing the realm. Your counsel is ever more refined, and your cultivation ever deeper.\n\nOn water, you sever dragons; on land, you cleave rhinoceroses, drawing the divine blade from its jeweled scabbard. Ahead, you spur the phoenix; behind, you lash the simurgh, driving the swift carriage upon the splendid path. Frequently entrusted with the half-bamboo tally, you have long reported the auspicious governance of Jiahe. Your benevolent heart embraces the people as parents, and your pure integrity is as unyielding as ice and frost.\n\nThe songs of harmony from the children ascend on high, and the selection of officials by the court must surely turn to you. The emperor, mindful of the people of Gusou, compares it to the vast prefecture of Fufeng. Weary from frequent changes in governance, the people hope for some respite. With your paired banners unfurled, all things exhale their breath.\n\nBoiling the mountains and seas does not hinder your reception in the envoys’ hall; holding the scales and wearing sandals, you ascend to attend the Jade Emperor’s court.\n\nI, who arrived in the capital most recently, am unworthy of even the sun’s warmth. My dreams are severed by the morning cock, and my skills are exhausted like the squirrel’s. Yet, fortunate to bask in your radiance so closely, I share in the shelter of your spreading shade. As colleagues in office, I dare to follow in the imperial procession to Ganquan; as a scholar awaiting your favor, I am surely an old acquaintance of the eastern chamber.\n\nOur admiration is heartfelt, yet our words are incomplete.\n\nOn behalf of the congratulatory address to the Chief Ministers upon the joyous snowfall:\n\nI humbly observe that the four seasons complete the year, and winter arrives to generate yang; with unified virtue, heaven is served, and clouds swiftly gather into snow. The cosmos is ever more auspicious, and the realm rejoices as one.\n\nI reverently consider that you, in your profound wisdom, harmonize the vital forces, consulting the omens of metal and grain to repel the wild, and pitying the soldiers encamped in armor at the frontier. You declare that the winter wheat stretches to the clouds, and you must still drive away the malevolent spirits; thus, the flying blossoms and frozen waters must be met with solemn offerings to the Dark Lord.\n\nA single thread of embroidery is added to the brocade, and the jade steps are adorned with six layers of snow. I, who have mistakenly shared in the grain transport, have witnessed this felicitous omen.\n\nThe fine wheat returns to Zhou, fulfilling the dream of a bountiful year; secretly, we bind Cai and await the daytime tidings of victory.",
      "overlap_context": " of Luoshe. The king says, \"Return swiftly!\"—you soothe the apes of Jiange; a soldier strays from his ranks—you quell the hedgehogs of the willow camp. Better to hold a spring purification festival in late spring than cross the Lu River in May.\n\nNow, the imperial edict changes your role, planting you in the imperial homeland. The palace’s celestial foundations extend the emperor’s mandate for ten thousand years; the towers’ cloud-reflected shadows gather the immortals of Penglai’s three islands.",

      "translated_text": "For the Winter Solstice Congratulating the Eminent Prince:\nI reverently consider that the Han inherited the celestial mandate, and its calendar extends into ten thousand years; winter yields to the year’s dawn, and the yang indeed returns on the seventh day. How grand is the founding elder of the imperial lineage, how fitting the auspicious omen of the river’s flow. I humbly regard you, whose virtue gleams like ice in a jade vessel, whose renown soars high as the handle of the Dipper. The king addresses you as “Uncle,” and you are enfeoffed with lands vast as the thatched hut’s domain; Heaven bestows upon the good man a lifespan as steadfast as the pine and cedar. In response to the embroidered brocade’s added thread, I offer the silken cord bearing treasures. I, who dwell in the fields and inquire of customs, know the shelter of summer when winter’s chill descends. The wooden oxen and flowing horses—how could they bear the warmth of military quilts? The jade belt with dangling fish—how I long only to draw near the imperial couch.\n\nFor the Winter Solstice Congratulating Vice-Director Shi of Pingjiang:\nI reverently consider that the phoenix tower records the clouds, harmonizing with the catalpa’s floss to mark the season; Tiger Hill lifts its snow, casting radiance upon the banners and standards. As we welcome the waxing of the yang force, abundant blessings converge in great measure. I humbly regard you, whose pure wind disciplines the officials, whose benevolent sun befits the people. In the eastern pavilion, the plum blossoms’ song still recalls the taste of the broth you seasoned; in the purple hall, the jade chimes resound as you take your place in the courtly ranks. Soon you will be granted the jade ring and permitted to inquire with your tablet in hand. I, who seek counsel yet offer little aid, have long relied on your sheltering care. The lanes and alleys hang lanterns, and I recall past wanderings in the grand prefecture; the palace courts resound with celebration, as we welcome the new imperial favor at the lofty gates.\n\nFor the Returned Congratulations to the Prefect of Qingyuan on the Winter Solstice:\nI note that the Lu observatory records the clouds stirring the catalpa’s floss to mark the season, while the Yin Tower lifts its snow, illuminating the repaired banners with radiance. As we welcome the waxing of the yang force, abundant blessings converge in great measure. I humbly regard you, whose pure wind disciplines the officials, whose benevolent sun befits the people. In the eastern pavilion, the plum blossoms bloom, continuing the mountain’s defiance of the cold; on West Lake, the ice congeals, evoking memories of leaning on the balustrade beneath the moon. I await the bestowal of Huang Ba’s gold, and the return of the jade pendants from the purple hall. I, who seek counsel yet offer little aid, have long relied on your sheltering care. Following you along the courtly paths, I vainly recall the traces of jade and jasper; in the new hall, receiving guests, I still hear the strains of strings and flutes. My admiration and praise know no bounds, yet my words fail to encompass them.\n\nFor the Returned Congratulations to the Prefect of Jiaxing on the Winter Solstice:\nI note that the phoenix tower records the clouds, verifying the subtle yang in the jade tubes, while Mandarin Duck Lake’s flying snow illuminates the auspicious colors on the commander’s flags. As we welcome the waxing of the yang force, abundant blessings converge in great measure. I humbly regard you, whose half-term as prefect has changed, yet whose prayers have inspired songs of praise. Near the five-chi heavens, the land gains weight through your presence; measuring the three-zhang shadows, governance renews with the season. Soon you will present the ceremonial slippers and socks, and return to the joy of filling the curtained halls. Towering over the literary stones, you will closely attend the sweet springs. I, who measure my worth and find it lacking, have long relied on your sheltering care. In the splendid hall, the clamor of music brings joy as I hear of the return of the vital breath; in the extraordinary fields, the harvest of grain prompts the submission of a report on the year’s abundance. In offering my praises, my words fail to suffice.\n\nFrom the Vice-Magistrate of Lin’an in Gratitude to the Chief Ministers:\nI consider that in this rocky district, I govern the people, barely escaping official censure; in the divine suburbs, I am suddenly honored with an appointment as vice-magistrate. Though the land is near, its standards are lofty, and I am ashamed that my person is humble and my talents shallow. The great potter’s wheel turns, yet how can I, mere mud on the axle, bear such a burden? Privately, I reflect that as the deputy of the heavenly prefecture, my carriage bears the title of “lesser prefect”; in the single metropolis of Qiantang, the court is closely surrounded. Though the staff may exceed three halls, the decisions truly concern the myriad affairs. For the pacification of the imperial chariot’s path, I serve as assistant and elder—this is no mere division of scenic delights to boast of to others. In the distant past of the Xining era, Su Shi occupied this seat; more recently, in the Jiading era, a remonstrating minister emerged from this post. Considering the weight of the responsibilities, one must possess both talent and ability to be deemed worthy.",

      "translated_text": "I prostrate myself in reflection: my origins are humble, my advancement late, my traces faint as the smallest blade of grass. My shelves sag with books—dare I yet fall into the habit of idle embroidery? My bed is piled with few tablets of office, and I bear the shame of an unshaped bow or uncast sword. Once, I was tested afar in Ou and Min; for three years, I drifted like a drumstick on the waves. No administrative merit to my name, no words of praise to offer. Returning east with my jade intact, I sought grain in Chang’an; knocking at your gate, I presumptuously presented a letter like that of Guang Fan. Though the six hundred bushels of a *zhizhong* might still be climbed, the fifteen-foot heavens south of the city remain beyond even my dreams. Yet by your great power of uplift and the profound workings of creation, days pass and months come—no need for long military service; morning departure, evening arrival—truly a convenience for my family.\n\nNot only have I been able to tend the graves of the orphaned on the plains where the wagtails nest, but I may also rest briefly in the village of chickens and pigs, allowing my lame steps to grind ink. In this stroke of fortune, how can I ever repay? Now, I humbly encounter your governance: the Eight Wastes open into domains, a single pillar holds up the sky. Xiao follows the compass, Cao follows the square—each in turn displays their merit to bring order to the age. The counsels of Fang, the decisiveness of Du—earnestly they cultivate governance to repel the barbarians. Office and rank are ever mindful of the heavy reins; men of talent are all gathered in the folds of your robe. Like unworked ore, I too am bathed in the kiln’s shaping.\n\nHow dare I not bear your great favor with reverence, upholding the teachings of my forebears? May I assist the mountain as it bears the carriage, and with my sash tied, ascend to the capital’s outskirts. What use is it to unfurl my steed’s potential? I listen for the whip on the locust-lined streets. How fortunate to stand among the hairpins and robes of the academy! I swear to dedicate my humble life in gratitude for your profound virtue.\n\nOn behalf of Zhao, Military Commissioner for Coastal Defense, I reverently note: your plans are deep and your governance expansive. In selecting a commander, who could surpass Yi of the Han? In military auspices, the Duke of Zhou presides over the east. Departing the jade steps, you set forth—heaven’s court rejoices in your union. I reflect that your breast holds ten thousand scrolls, your brush inverts the Three Rivers. From youth, you bore the expectations of the court; content with gradual advancement, you have endured the toils of command. When the court sought to rescue the paper currency, you embodied the noble image of \"pulling the roots.\" At the pinnacle of the hundred officials, you navigated the two handles of power. Passing the Hall of Government Affairs, even the prime minister would listen with changed countenance; applying the standards of the *Spring and Autumn*, the historians would record your deeds with their brushes. Soon you would join the ranks of those who wear the hairpins of the law and carry the satchels of state, to settle the discussions of gold and silk with the Xiongnu.\n\nIn ancient times, at Mount Gou, the spring muster was held. Testing the faults of six or seven paces, the soldiers would clamor and lose formation. Yet bearing the double honor of a second or third appointment, you stood resolute as you took up your post. The vanguard was on alert, the willows of Xiliu changed color. You personally bestowed the azure axe of authority, leisurely playing chess in your villa’s separate garden. Like Han Yu entering the camp of Tingcou, the young warriors submitted; like Guo Ziyi succeeding Li Guangbi, the banners shone with renewed brilliance. Swiftly hearing your praises, I returned to join your counsel.\n\nFor me, attending court is a great fortune, though my grain transport duties are unworthy. Relying on the lingering radiance of the pivot of power, I hope to join the pure gatherings of the Moon Tower. Moreover, with the vermilion banner’s departure to the garrison, I rejoice in the added luster of the purple sash. My wandering heart is moved by parting, yet how dare I presume upon such grand courtesies? You spur your horse ahead of me—I lament my own stagnation like a single phase of hardship. Breaking willow branches to send you off, I can only pray for a reunion in glory. Our shared aspirations and heartfelt designs—how could they be exhausted?\n\nOn behalf of the Guardian of Yanzhou Prefecture, I reverently note: your mandate governs the domain, your banner planted at the auspicious hour. Your name is inscribed on the golden tally, its brilliance joining the eastern wall’s splendor; your carriage bears the vermilion banner, towering above the guest star’s station. Why did Shu Du come so late? The traces of Wen Zheng shine still.\n\nI reflect that your learning rivals the archives of Ye, your bearing as refined as Kun’s jade. Solemn in thought, never lacking reverence, your demeanor is long practiced among the three thousand. Advancing in the Way, your magnanimity overflows—early on, you mastered the vital points of the twelve meridians. You share the reputation of the elder and younger brothers’ ocarina and flute, and possess the fragrance of the *Spring and Autumn*’s orchids and chrysanthemums. Fitting for the court, yet you serve in the provinces. Tracing the mast to the clear rapids, your halberds bristle along the upper reaches. Between fields and cottages, the people suffer under the white tax collectors; the granaries and treasuries stand nearly empty. Yet with your vision, you must change the board and place the pieces anew. Your skill surpasses others—you can make cakes without even showing your face. After just a few months of governance, the songs of the Five Breeches resound. Soon you will enter the ranks of the dukes and ministers, washing clean the armor and weapons.\n\nI, your unworthy servant, can offer no worthy embellishment—my royal duties are but toil. The hair in the mirror has turned to stars, the tides at the river’s edge rise like houses. I was about to split the paper to congratulate you when suddenly your gracious letter arrived. Recalling your thousand cavalry passing through the capital, we shared but a single cup by the waterside. Observing the customs of the capital’s left, I long chanted poems among the mixed ranks. Borrowing the path of the pear-blossom shade, I soon felt the joy of Tao Yuanming’s return. My repayment is inadequate, my longing for your homeland deepens.\n\nOn behalf of Zhao, Supervising Censor of Anji Prefecture, I reverently note: you have been selected among the worthy, assigned to govern the capital’s outskirts. Joining the ranks of a dozen or so peers, you honorably wear the silver hare’s seal; ruling over the eight hundred states of the Ji clan, you purely occupy the palace of crystal waters. From your first descent into office, every household rejoiced.\n\nI reflect that your conduct reaches high as the heavens, your capacity vast as the deep pool. Broad in learning and rich in knowledge, your staff shines like the blue flame of Taiyi; self-proclaimed in your elegance, you don the purple brocade of the banished immortal. Others know to rise straight to the clouds, but you proceed slowly, reining in your steed. Having soared to display your steed’s prowess, you now mount your horse to heed the cock’s crow. On the eastern bed of the forbidden palace, you have observed extraordinary scholars; in the western wing of the secretariat, why not gather the courtiers? Unwilling to linger in the shade of a single banner, you test your ability to summon the Six Guests. With ample leisure in official matters, the songs and odes resound near the heavens. Your retiring chambers are fragrant, awaiting the governance of Gong and Huang; in the hall of state, you will surely follow the footsteps of Fu and Yan.\n\nI, your unworthy grain transporter, have long known your compassion. Recalling our unhurried conversations at the gate, I rejoice in your vigorous assumption of the governorship. Not relying on passing guests to adorn your kitchen, how could you again pursue the clerks’ door-knocking?",
      "overlap_context": " Though the staff may exceed three halls, the decisions truly concern the myriad affairs. For the pacification of the imperial chariot’s path, I serve as assistant and elder—this is no mere division of scenic delights to boast of to others. In the distant past of the Xining era, Su Shi occupied this seat; more recently, in the Jiading era, a remonstrating minister emerged from this post. Considering the weight of the responsibilities, one must possess both talent and ability to be deemed worthy.",

      "translated_text": "Your governance has so thoroughly satisfied the people’s wishes that I am truly convinced of your extraordinary nature. Yet the ornate letter you sent me seems still bound by convention. My hasty divination proves but a fleeting effort, my admiration a vain toil.\n\n**Reply on behalf of the Vice Magistrate of Changzhou Guard Temple:**\nI have learned with reverence of your appointment as prefect, exchanging the frontier post for pastoral rule. As the clouds part over Mount Heng, do not weary your carriage or feed your horses; when the moon fills the Xing Creek, you may truly drift as a floating home. With a single decree, your teachings spread; with every command, songs of praise resound. I humbly recall your learning vast as gold, your writings deep as the jade sea—yet you never climbed the vermilion steps of examination halls, instead hastening to vie for the banner of office. A thousand bushels of emerald grain—what are they to you? Your mastery of statutes fills your breast; your governance flows effortless from your brush. Graceful as the *yu* bird in flight, your reputation shines bright. Now, in the lands of Lingling’s rivers and mountains, you will consult widely and deliberate wisely, dreaming of Pingquan’s gardens and flowers, composing early your \"Returning Home.\" Above, you honor your noble lineage; below, you govern a neighboring prefecture. Though the mountains yield no tribute, your retiring chambers remain fragrant; though the post station grants no jade ring, you may yet test the ink of millet pellets. As for me—what can a starry court expect from one so unworthy? My frost-laced temples startle even myself. Though I fear the ruin of neglect, I exult in the fortune of your respect. Bathing in the Yi, I ponder Master Zeng’s lingering thoughts of stone shores and zither books; gazing at the Qi, I admire Duke Wei’s resolve to inherit the mantle of sandbank robes. My reply begins with these words, yet the ink cannot contain my gratitude.\n\n**Reply on behalf of the New Prefect of Jiaxing, Vice Censor Yu:**\nI have learned with reverence of your appointment, transmitted beyond the passes, as you assume the seal of governance. In the annals of history, this is Zui Li—a land renowned for its prestige. To aid the capital is called Fufeng, yet the heavens feel not distant. Your reputation spreads easily, reviving the people’s spirits. I humbly recall your bearing, lofty as Penglai and Langfeng, your temperament resonant as the great bell Huangzhong. Your breast holds the classics, all teaching the ways of honoring the sovereign and sheltering the people; your hall brims with vitality, grasping the essentials of enriching the state and strengthening the army. You ascend by first descending, having served abroad before returning to the center. You do not betray your office, for the noble man sharpens his weapons. Though younger, you are no lesser brother—why not join the ranks of governance? Will you linger in obscurity, girded with a cooking pot? Rather, find joy in playful colors. The emperor, mindful of the hidden dragon at Fuling, pities the people suffering under the tiger’s cruelty. His decrees renew, his reforms begin close at hand. Your oars glide smoothly on Yuan Lake—how different from plucking plums on Su Dyke? Poems arrive from Phoenix Pond, surpassing even dreams of Xie’s poolside grasses. Soon, you will repay the highest of caresses, swiftly returning to the ranks of the select. As for me—my grain transport bears no merit, yet I am blessed to shelter in your favor. Your paired prose arrives suddenly in my sleeve; I treasure it beneath my headscarf. To see you off, I might earn the laughter of palm-leaf skirts; to hear of your ascent, I await the songs of proclamation. My praise and hope are boundless, my gratitude unending.\n\n**Reply on behalf of Prefect Wang of Jiangyin:**\nI have learned with reverence of your appointment as prefect, governing the capital’s domain with virtue. As a passing official, you bypass the imperial gates without entering. Your plain letter moves me deeply; I strain to hear the sound of your carriage. I humbly recall your lineage, noble and rare, your conduct pure and refined—father and son both flourished early as orchid sprouts, yet now only you remain as the blossoming branch. Your ambitions are serene, unhurried, yet your steps ascend high. Having rested in yellow silk, you now lean upon the crimson carriage rail. On Ke Mountain, the chess pieces scatter—seek the immortal’s trace of a single axe. On Shen River, the waves calm—fulfilling the prophetic dream of three knives. How could you be unfit for a grand county? You are more than capable of nurturing its humble people. A brief trial of your governance, and soon you will be summoned to higher ranks. As for me—my service is worn, my toil unworthy. Though the law demands demotion, you promote me; though I long to return home, I must linger. I am no swift steed like Xianyu, yet dare I claim to be the grain transport’s lucky star? In the land of Yi, there is Xiang—listen for the songs of the three-chapter boy. My hasty reply is but a fleeting effort; my admiration, a vain toil.\n\n**Reply on behalf of Vice Director Zhao of Wenzhou:**\nI have learned with reverence of your appointment as prefect, bearing the imperial decree and the honor of a private gate. Rising from the rank of two thousand piculs, you receive the left tally in the Han palace; as a kinsman of the eight hundred states, you aid the eastern screen of the Zhou realm. The people sing at dusk, and I rejoice in your harmony. I humbly recall your conduct, lofty as the heavens, your capacity vast as the abyss. Your learning is broad and deep, your knowledge like the immortal’s green reed staff; your elegance is self-proclaimed, your robes of purple silk like those of the banished immortal. In governance, your achievements are boundless; in merit, your successes shine bright. Swift as a soaring steed, you rise to the cock’s crow. As a scholar-official in the capital, you served in two administrations; as a noble man bearing arms, you drew near the thousand peaks. The joys of Orchid Pavilion are unending; the longing of the Xuan Hall runs deep. You ride the green carriage, your retinue lush. Do not sigh in sorrow, for you are a compassionate parent to the people. With governance proven, you will swiftly return to the ranks of the select. As for me—what rank can I claim? I share only the humble task of grain transport. Weary of the dust of ledgers, I dream of pines and chrysanthemums in my garden. A crane follows you in joy, heralding your new governance; twin fish shame me, arriving before your splendid letter. Though I have not been punished, I humbly offer my loyal counsel.\n\n**Reply on behalf of Registrar Li of Taizhou:**\nI have learned with reverence of your appointment as prefect of the left capital district, your star aligned with the central terrace. Bamboo horses fill the suburbs—clear the roads to welcome the new governor; wooden oxen deliver grain—your colleagues bid farewell to the old. I envision your jurisdiction, your decrees bringing peace. I humbly recall your roots, deep as the immortal plum, your fame resounding like the celestial chime. Your debates flow like the Yangtze, endless in their depth; your decisions cut like a blade through empty space. Gentle, kind, reverent, and yielding, you hold yourself with ease—thus your actions are tranquil and harmonious. You savor the humble taste of the prefect’s crab, yet rise early to the cock’s crow. Your memorials fill the imperial carriage, swift as morning petitions answered by dusk. With many weapons at hand, you cultivate inner strength while repelling external threats. Gathering your spirit and focus, you now stand in the court.",

Though the court’s decrees remain unenforced, the people’s ailments suddenly ease. Heaven does not withhold ripe grain from the barren valley; the city stands unburied as the river calms. Five hundred tea blossoms suffice for the stone bridge’s offerings; three thousand bamboo slips swiftly return to the Golden Horse ranks. As for me—what worth have I? My longing for return remains unfulfilled. I often recall our earnest court conversations, regretting only the lateness of our bond. Now, in this time of reverent service, I am most fortunate to rely on you.\n\nYou instructed the people in raising two mother swine, knowing abundance flows from harmony. You gifted me a pair of carp—how unworthy I am of such paired elegance. In haste, I send these scattered thoughts, my heart full of earnest regard.\n\n**Reply to Prefect Chen of Wuzhou**\nI have learned you now reside in the imperial presence, bearing the imperial charge in precious Wuzhou. The green-felt mat of my office and the seal of governance have passed, like Yao’s purple steeds, to your hands. When you arrived, children rode bamboo horses to welcome you; now, as the tripod of office is first entrusted, I am fortunate to have served with you.\n\nI humbly recall your vast learning and expansive writing, your Dao pure and virtue complete. Like the single qilin that emerged, scholars knew Han Yu was worthy of emulation. Like three phoenixes taking flight, people lamented Liu Fen’s failure to pass the exams. Having governed two prefectures along the Yangtze and Huai, you brought peace to the hills and valleys for years. How is it you now serve as a gentleman of the court, nearly fit to counsel the state? Chrysanthemums still bloom by the Tiao and Zha rivers; your boat often drifts toward Penglai. By the twin streams of bright moonlight, you surpass the three districts of Fufeng. The people of Tongxiang love you, as if hearing the zither of the branch city. In Bohai, exhorting agriculture, you listened to the watchtower’s horn. Seeking the transformative power of poetry and books, you traced the immortal’s footsteps at Chishi. I await your chariot bearing the sword and satchel, ascending directly to office.\n\nI, mistakenly sharing in the transport of grain, what counsel could I offer? Divided among the offices of the vermilion halls, I still recall the joy of attending court with you. In the yellow hall, reporting governance, I hear the songs of contented service. Now, as the sun’s appointed time approaches, I offer belated congratulations. Your precious letter humbles me; its splendor is beyond instruction.\n\n**Reply to Vice-Director Zhang of Jianchang**\nI have learned you were granted imperial favor in the Han Hall, now serving as vice-governor of the river city. For the people, you journeyed far from a single homestead, while I, hindered by the suburbs, could not welcome you as a subordinate governor. You called for a servant and obtained a foot of silk, entrusting the postal relay at the capital gate. Your new arrangements foretell the success of your peaceful governance.\n\nI humbly recall your mastery of the orthodox lineage of poetry and books, your noble integrity from an esteemed family. As a teacher to emperors and kings, you laughed as you retrieved an old man’s shoes at night. With the aid of rivers and mountains, your great hand naturally produced timely compositions. Wherever you served, you acted with effortless grace. In high office, you received the battle-axe like Jian Feng; in lesser roles, you still commanded the banners of Wanfu. As state affairs grow urgent, why not select outstanding talent? How is it you now serve as vice-director? Traveling the three valleys of Mayuan, you feast on qilin meat. Following the eight seats of Wenchang’s excellence, the mandarin ducks hasten to their ranks.\n\nI, unchanged in my foolishness, what use could I be? Still bound to the imperial court, I labor to reinforce the dikes against the surging tides. Thus, I dare not request a transfer, though I deem your favor too generous. Regarding our shared roots, my reverence is but a fluttering heart. Preserve the pines and chrysanthemums—return to the joy of the leisurely countryside. In this brief note of celebration, I still seek your wise counsel.\n\n**Reply to Administrator Lin**",

The honored guest entering the tent first bent the pride of his distinguished travels. The post at Zaoqiu was but a toil for the weary; yet the talents of Pingzhou deigned to follow me. Gazing upon a single reed, I am humbled by this pair of fish. Reverently I reflect: your natural endowment is lofty, your administrative skill keen. Repeatedly you have submitted the finest reports on planting peaches, poised for a journey among the jujubes. Among the twenty-five stars of the Supreme Culmen, why not pluck their blossoms for the Gentlemen’s Court? Like the wine of Chang’an—ten thousand coins a measure—you might yet shake the lapels of the military commissary. Having somewhat displayed your cultivated talents, you swiftly ascend to key positions. Though I am unworthy of my post as observer of customs, I possess a rough heart for honoring worthies. Now that you, my old friend, have come, what matter could fail to be settled? I hope we may join hands as if drawn from the sleeve, not merely scatter coins upon the ground. Following the example of the *West Lake Ode on Plum Blossoms*, you still have leisure to spare. Compared to Nanfeng holding his incense petals, this seems beyond what I deserve. As my divination reports remain unfulfilled, I long to pour out my words in person.\n\n**Reply to Vice-Director Liu of Lin’an**\n\nHumbly I reflect: as I arrive, you depart—do not linger, leaving your talent behind the painted curtain. Your virtue is proclaimed and your renown spreads; rarely does one see such reluctance to part with the official robe. Your lofty writings have bestowed favor; how could I privately express my thanks? Reverently I consider: born of the cinnabar caves, you contend in splendor with the purple cliffs. Twin phoenixes at play, you early earned merit in the ink-sealed office. A lone egret in ascent, you once continued the verses of the pearl-hung curtains. Now selected for the minor prefecture, you hasten in rank with the great dawn. I am old; fortunately, military affairs have concluded, and I recall the lychees of my homeland. Already I prepare my return, entrusting plum blossoms to the river post. Do not forget our old bond; guard your health in the heat, and may I soon hear of your promotion.\n\n**Reply to Military Intendant Luo of Xingguo**\n\nFrom the Son of Heaven’s service, you are entrusted with governing a city. Speaking with the elders, you find the people starving in the flooded waters. The mulberry fields lie desolate, the cloth tax newly levied—all vitality has returned. Reverently I consider: you possess your father’s bearing, having repeatedly earned the highest marks in officialdom. Beneath the oilcloth tent, you often composed impassioned poems. Borrowing the steps of the jade hall, you frequently voiced towering arguments. Gazing upon Fuchuan as your command, you gather the many streams into a surging flow. The people, not yet relieved like fish and turtles, face the long-standing garrison of tigers and leopards. The emperor’s heart is set upon you; your capable hands are relied upon. Let the people live as in Qingzhou, where you personally tax the mountains and transport grain. Open the map of the capital district, and together prepare weapons and repair chariots. As snow departs and frost returns, my heart is weary, my body exhausted. To be joined by such colleagues is my good fortune. You have graciously allowed me to wander briefly; upon returning to my hometown, I have already resolved to retire.\n\n**Reply to Policy Advisor Su**\n\nThe emperor’s decree selects the scholar’s cap, sent forth from the Yellow River’s source. Your office resides in the advisory tent; you come to gaze upon the painted eaves. Your kind letter suffices to reveal our bond as colleagues. Reverently I consider: you are gentle and steadfast, serene and free from scheming. Having submitted the finest reports amid music and governance, you are willing to compose verses in leisure by incense’s glow. The suburban fields await your presence—why not summon the Minister of Works from Jiannan? The borderlands remain unrecovered; you bring the Xiongnu to the palace gates. When counsel is needed, you are consulted, and though unsummoned, you arrive in accord. By chance, I have fortunately returned from my travels and have already firmly requested a temple post.",

      "translated_text": "Beholding these petty villains as mere rats—how can this be called great merit? Yet encountering Shaogong’s descendant of the paulownia, one may glimpse the literary and scholarly legacy.\n\nWith the alert lifted but recently settled, my report in response has been sorely lacking.\n\n**Substitute Memorial for Prefectural Judge Zhao’s Recommendation**\n\nFive ranks align with Heaven’s decree, yet I dare presume upon the awe of the executioner’s axe. A single word of praise outshines the embroidered robes of honor; swiftly, the public carriage’s memorial is revealed. Sought from afar, all who hear are astonished. My deepest gratitude carves into liver and lungs; I barely unfold it in brush and ink.\n\nI humbly observe: the official path is often constrained by selection and rotation, while the weight of recommendation rests heavily upon the office held. To unite these four virtues is rare indeed—like seeking the roasted flesh of the osprey, it cannot be obtained. Yet with a single poetic touch, as when a dragon’s eye is dotted and it takes flight. Those below yearn to submit, while those on high delight in their achievement.\n\nI reflect with reverence: I am but a small and insignificant man, bound by a humble post. The Qing River and its jade-green peaks were once called prosperous, but now the green waters and red lotuses have become a sea of suffering. Drought and locusts follow one upon the other; in the fields, many wear the gaunt look of famine. Grain is scarce, and even in the courtyards, few officials stand in orderly ranks. While I diligently attend to my duties, I anxiously scheme for my own welfare. One misplaced arrow undoes all prior merit—thus I must first split the willow and advance step by step. Nine cinnabar elixirs transmute the bones; thus I lick the tripod’s rim and drool in desire.\n\nSpring’s light has only just stirred upon Yu Gu, yet the sacred relics have already formed within the stupa. Stubborn and benighted, sitting in a well—what purity or clarity can there be? Facing a wall, how can one become perceptive and quick? I evade even coarse blame from official censure. How could I presume to accept such excessive praise? My estimation only deepens my shame.\n\nThis is all due to your esteem, for you possess the talent to bear the weight of pillars and mountains, though your person dwells by rivers and lakes. Transmitting the Dao, you continue the pulse of the sages across a thousand generations. Unmoved by favor, you fulfill the heart of a true gentleman. Dwelling in ritual and music, you bring them luster; recognizing worthy talent, you inevitably raise it up. Yet one as feeble and trifling as I—how could I merit such searching and exaltation?\n\nDare I not sharpen my resolve for public integrity and incorruptibility, repaying your singular grace with utmost devotion? May my bearing resemble the joyous music of the apricot altar, my reputation suffused with the fragrance of cassia and orchid records. Perhaps then I may repay my seated patron at the gate, or even glimpse my late father in the underworld. Are others truly less than kin of the same surname? Like Mao Yuan, I am fortunate to claim descent from Zhou. Let not your voice fade into the distance; my heart, like the river’s depths, dares not turn against you further.\n\nWherever the cinnabar gate turns, the bright sun shines upon it.\n\n**Substitute Memorial for Vice Chancellor Pi**",

      "translated_text": "Here is the translation:\n\n---\n\nThe kindness of your favor has entrusted me with a bond, and the high court has recorded my name in its ledger. The Radiant Standard’s letter has come, and beneath your canopy, I have received the recommendation of embroidered robes. You open the clouded heavens for ten thousand *li*, gathering peach and plum into one gate. The weight of your grace is heavy, my life light—gratitude runs deep, and tears gather.\n\nI humbly consider that for those awaiting appointment, the sole duty is to await their rank’s change; for those who recommend, the office’s charge is most exacting. To fulfill all four requirements is difficult, as they are strung together like the Tiger Marquis’s tally. To await even one is to seize the dragon boat’s banner with boldness. Without the vajra pestle’s power to uphold, how could the Jade Maiden’s basin ever be propped into place? Neither too soon nor too late—like taking what is already in hand.\n\nI reflect that I am but a rough and withered sapling, a lame nag slow of step. Floating like a lotus upon water, I first displayed but faint skill in assent; eating bitterness and drinking ice, I merely observed the precepts of self-discipline. Gazing at the seven steps, I stumble; circling the three trees, I hesitate. Though fellow candidates may lack feeling, I alone have borne the favor of the venerable Grand Academician’s regard. Though I stood alone another day, I still received the great Chancellor’s compassion. Just as the red banner tramples the victory report, and the festive robe floats upon the longevity cup, I recall the single cassia branch of the Xun clan, beneath the five clouds of Duke Yu. What virtue do I possess to merit such response? Yet the echo follows the sound.\n\nThis is all due to your noble encounter with one who heals the state as a great physician, a towering pillar upholding the heavens. When Lord Wei personally oversaw the return, ruler and minister rejoiced; when Lord Fengyang held the office of Commanding Duke, both parents were living. Spirit converged in one hall, awe spread to the four frontiers. The pledge of the Yellow River as a sash was firm; the *Fengshui*’s poem of *qi*-sprouts was continued. No matter how fine or coarse the talent, all were cultivated; whether in court or beyond, all were employed with skill. Thus the harmony of Ying turned the tuning pegs.\n\nDare I not steadfastly hold to my plain heart, striving to repay your boundless grace? Observing distant ministers, I see they do not stray from the bonds of father and son, brother and brother. Serving the state with the multitude, I accept the judgment of heaven, earth, ghosts, and spirits. Your commands I follow without question; to advance or retreat, what excuse could I offer?\n\n**Reply to Vice Director Zhao on His Congratulatory Summons**\n\nThough unworthy of the commission, I long ago severed the dream of the scholar’s lamp. The summons to return came with urgency, and still I am touched by the fragrance of birch torches. Now that the reins of governance are newly taken, I would follow the wall’s edge if I could. Yet I am ashamed of my undeserved position, truly the result of your praise. Before I could present my resignation in a carriage of *xie* bamboo, I was first shamed by gifts of brocade and silk. Compelled by your verses’ persuasion, I reluctantly rise to act. It is not that the mountain grows lighter when men depart; how can I avoid the shame of the forest and the remorse of the ravine? Though the night’s audience may not distinguish the lotus torch, the spring light has long been revealed in the willow branches. Since the throne does not abandon its ministers, dare I recite the lines of the northern gate’s hidden hut? As you see me off like a guest, I shall continue the poem of the southern ford’s green waves. Allow me to speak further, that I may be guided by propriety.\n\nWhat is raised must not be abandoned; what is loved should be aided. Briefly I report my fermentation; I shall await the chance to pour out my gratitude in full.\n\n**Declining the Monthly Salary from the Transport Bureau to Vice Director Zhao**\n\nBeside the desk, I wield the brush, vainly boasting of an immortal’s rank; within the tent, I draft dispatches, occasionally following in illustrious footsteps. My wooden tablets and lead have only exhausted my spirit; seals and sashes I return to my breast. Like one who plows not yet rides a horse, dare I hunt while clad in rags? Your gifts are too generous; my refusal is difficult. Initially, I pleaded illness, intending to reduce it in the coming year. If I still speak of salary, then my acceptance today would be wrong. Rather than accept a noble’s gift, I would crudely uphold a rustic’s integrity. Kindly refuse on my behalf; none surpass you in this. With lavish seasonal feasts, I have already enjoyed wine worth ten thousand coins; with forthright words, I shall seek the hundred thousand to buy a mountain. Permit me to divine the response; I shall separately express my profound thanks.\n\n**Reply to Wang Xiangxian’s Gift of Poetry**\n\nThe lofty scholar does not engage in petty official duties; Lord De seldom emerges, strictly observing mourning for his teacher. Yet after three refusals, you strongly urged me to stay, and now you honor me with two chapters of congratulatory verse. I measure my decline and inadequacy—how could I merit such praise? Only because I recognize the hierarchy of medicine’s ruler and minister do I not abandon the *Felling Trees* to preserve friendship. With the two of us as witnesses, I trust there will be no words to cast me down. With a hundred mouths, I guarantee it—there will come a day like Mount Zhi. Be patient a while longer; a light reprimand would be fitting.\n\n**Reply to Record-Keeper Xiong of Chicheng Abbey**\n\nYou emulate the immortals’ play at Red Wall, having long admired their noble traces. Like Yang Ziyun inquiring about rare characters, you suddenly arrive in a lofty carriage. From your sleeve, you produce paired verses; your clogs break the emptiness of my joy. Weary of following the examination candidates, I have personally continued the legacy of Song Yu. The fragrance of books and classics fills my breast; I grasp the world-transcending charms of mist and clouds. Literature is but one skill—idly I wander the arts at my brush’s tip. The two classics of the Dao and virtue I have long savored at the root of my tongue. When the time comes, I shall harness the moon and journey. Yet I am already old and returning—your praise exceeds reality. Gold and jade have their fixed value; I am ashamed not to be one who recognizes treasure. Wind and cloud enter my heroic aspirations—you should choose a place to establish yourself. Moreover, you are young; now is the time to read widely. I, Dongpo, have returned in decline; your reputation is yet to be fulfilled.\n\n**Reply to Scholar Nie’s Gift of Introduction**\n\nBeneath the empty eaves, the sun dries my graying hair; the full assembly stirs the wind—delighted to see a scholar with three ears. You honor me with brocade and silk, knowing we drink from the same crystal river. Long a guest at the Huai border, where weapons are not yet stilled, I have just returned to my homeland, where pines and chrysanthemums still remain. Why so suddenly cry hunger and cold? It is no harm to be content with poverty and live simply. I hide nothing from you—how can I grasp the white clouds upon the ridge? You must plan for yourself; naturally, there is a golden house within your books. Ashamed to be a host on this land, I offer only the wine of a fellow townsman.\n\n**Reply to Palace Supervisor Wang on His Congratulatory Summons**\n\nThe recluse returns to the mountains, yet still occupies the seat of governance. The messenger hastens to Long, urging a return to the disordered hut. Ascending the carriage is like casting dice to select an official; approaching the palace gate resembles a macaque entering a sack. By chance, the shame of the secluded valley is washed away; perhaps the shortcut’s mockery is stirred. Your poetic gifts of favor fill me with gratitude. Just as you move the court to inscribe the common carriage, dare I offend the seat to answer the visiting star?",
