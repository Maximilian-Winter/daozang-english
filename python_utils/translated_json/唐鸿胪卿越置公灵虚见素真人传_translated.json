  "full_translation": "**The Transmission of Tang Dynasty Perfected Person Ye**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Transmission of Tang Dynasty Perfected Person Ye* (also titled *The Transmission of Tang Dynasty Chief Minister of State Ceremonies, Duke of Yue, Perfected Person Lingxu Jiansu*)\n\nOne scroll. Author unknown. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Genealogical Records* Category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *The Transmission of Tang Dynasty Perfected Person Ye***\n\nThe Daoist school takes clarity, stillness, and emptiness as its foundation; the Immortal school takes guiding and refining as its method. The First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han once sought immortals, yet having sought without success, they declared: \"How could immortals exist in the world? It is all delusion and falsehood.\"\n\nAlas! The transformations of the numinous are boundless, the subtle and formless beyond fathoming. To cast aside the trappings of fame and rank is to tread the mire of official caps and carriages. How could such sovereigns, ensnared by excessive desires, ever summon them?\n\nWhen I served as prefect of Kuocang, my cousin, Gentleman Zhang, was a master of the Daoist lineage and a true feathered adept. One day, he visited me and presented *The Transmission of Perfected Master Ye*. Upon reading it, I saw how he summoned divine beings and encountered immortal visitors—all through a lifetime of dedicated refinement and cultivation. His immortal bearing and Daoist essence had long resonated with the numinous, enabling him to move and harmonize with them so effortlessly. This was also because he was filial to his parents, loyal to his sovereign, and thus able to stir heaven and earth, to move ghosts and spirits. His rank as a high minister allowed him to command wind and ride thunder, to receive the honor of heaven’s nobility—how could mere mortal titles ever confine him?\n\nNow, his immortal transformation has endured for nearly a thousand years. When the people pray for clear skies or beseech rain, his blessings extend to all living beings. His responses are as swift as an echo, and so he rightfully receives offerings and sacrifices. The fragrant incense burns endlessly, and in a single day, his legacy shall endure for ten thousand generations without end.\n\nWritten in the spring of the *gengzi* year of the Chunyou era by Ma Guangzu of Yuzhai.\n\n---\n\n**The Transmission of Perfected Person Lingxu Jiansu, Duke of Yue, Chief Minister of State Ceremonies of the Tang Dynasty**\n\nThe Perfected Person’s surname was Ye. His given name was Fas han, courtesy name Daoyuan, and alternate name Taisu. He was originally from Nanyang. Since the time of Duke Shen of Ye, his lineage descended from the Liang clan. During the late Han, under Emperors Huan and Ling, his family fled to the lands east of the Yangtze. His earliest ancestor, Jian, sought fine mountains and rivers and found them in Nanxiang of Kuaiji, where he concealed himself between the *mao* and *you* directions and settled in Songyang.\n\nHis great-grandfather, Qianyu, was renowned for his virtue and power. His grandfather, Daoxing, upheld the family’s legacy without fail. His father, Guozhong, first established the grand lineage. His father, Huiming, studied poetry and ritual as a Confucian scholar but never pursued glory or favor. He wandered through mountains and forests, resting his head on stones and rinsing his mouth with streams. He sang as he carried firewood and often wove grass into shelters. He foresaw the unseen, saying, \"I shall have a son.\"\n\nHis wife, née Liu, once dreamed during her daytime rest that a shooting star entered her mouth, which she swallowed, and soon after conceived. After fifteen months, in the year *kundun*, during the month of *huangzhong*, the Perfected Person was born. The sky was free of floating clouds, and the four seasons were bright and clear. An extraordinary fragrance filled the room, and divine radiance illuminated the hall.\n\nAmidst lingering rosy clouds, black cranes descended from above. While the Perfected Person yet dwelt in the womb, his voice was heard beyond. At birth, he was keen and bright; in childhood, precocious and discerning. By the age of seven, his bearing was gentle and refined, his countenance ancient and mature. His father gazed upon him and said, \"Though you are young and diligent now, in old age you shall attain noble grace.\"\n\nThereupon, he crossed the river and wandered for three years without returning, so that his family believed him drowned. When he came back and was asked the reason, he replied, \"Two azure youths led me away, gave me cloud-essence to drink, and detained me for some time.\"\n\nAt the age of ten, a physiognomist declared, \"With your sun-browed, moon-deep features, your towering shoulders and constricted lower frame, you shall one day become the teacher of emperors.\" Upon reaching twenty, he stood nine feet tall, his forehead marked with two *wu* characters. His nature was pure and unsullied; from childhood, he abstained from meat and dwelt alone in secluded chambers. Fond of ancient learning, at eleven he recited the *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents*, and at twelve studied rites and music. He delved deeply into the *Zhouyi*, and took profound delight in the works of Laozi and Zhuangzi. The *He-Luo* charts and apocrypha he examined in full. His aspiration was to cultivate the Dao, dwelling in forests and springs.\n\nWith his father, he retired to Maoshan, where they lived by gathering firewood and wild plants. Seeking auspicious sites, he observed the stars and monitored the *qi*. He ascended lofty peaks and descended into deep ravines, tracing the sources of rivers and traversing perilous paths. Already, he commanded spirit attendants: a massive boulder blocked the path before his dwelling, but when he cast a talisman, the stone rose and flew away in an instant, landing in the southeast of the mountain. All who witnessed this were astonished. To this day, a stone hollow remains on Maoshan.\n\nOften he sought hidden places and visited recluses, discovering the sacred site of Lingxu. There lay the stream where Ou Ye forged his swords. By Ou Brook stood the tomb of a divine maiden; nearby were Stone Gate Ridge and the Immortal’s Drag-Sandal Ridge. The mountain’s terrain encompassed the Grotto-Heaven of Kuocang, the Divine Capital, stretching onward to Tiantai and Siming. Not far distant lay the Red Pine Grotto of Changshan in Jinhua, where Huang Chuping had commanded the stone sheep. Between them flowed the White Horse Mountain’s waterfall, while the sheer cliffs of Green Brook—anciently called Immortal’s Abode—were lush with verdant forests and springs. Here the Perfected Person took refuge.\n\nThough his family was poor, he once said, \"I live in this world, yet my work remains unfinished. With aged parents at home, how shall I provide for them?\" So he hired himself out to till the fields, laboring without rest day after day, often shaded by a canopy of purple clouds. When others tried to claim the shaded spot, the clouds followed him. Once, a fisherman swept him into the mud with his net, yet he neither spoke nor showed anger. When a herdsman’s horse trampled his crops, he bore no grudge; when a cowherd stole his metal tools, he remained unperturbed.\n\nAfter his parents’ passing, he sought a burial site near Ou Brook. There, a white deer lay in the snow at the mountain’s foot; as he approached, the deer leapt away, leaving its resting place warm, with a white mist stretching unbroken across the heights and depths. The Perfected Person marveled at this and stood for a moment, surveying the mountain. Its layered ridges and overlapping hills embraced the four cardinal directions, while the terrain to the left and right, before and behind, rose and fell in perfect accord, its form and configuration fully realized.\n\nHe sighed and said, \"This place may serve as a burial site.\" Thereupon, he buried them there.\n\nThe Perfected Person said, \"Without encountering a renowned master, how can one transcend the world?\" At the time, he was but thirteen years of age. He journeyed from Mount Guacang into Tiantai, Siming, Jinhua, and Kuaiji, crossing the rivers and lakes of Zhejiang. Northward, he entered Tianzhu, Tianmu, Gusu, Dongting, Gouqu, Mount Heng, and Mount Huo. Southward, he traveled along the Jian River, ascended Red City, and reached Luofu, among other places. Wherever there were famous mountains and sacred sites, south of the Jiang and Han rivers, he traversed them all.\n\nHe sought out Master Wan of Yuzhang to learn the arts of elixir-refining, grain avoidance, guiding and pulling, and embryonic breathing. Yet he practiced only bear-hanging and bird-stretching, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, eating pine seeds and tree bark, remaining indifferent to worldly glory. At fifteen, he was poisoned nearly to death. Then he saw a blue youth who said, \"The immortals of Gouqu and Lord Mao of Tiantai shall rescue you with a flying seal.\" No sooner had the words been spoken than the seal arrived, imprinting his abdomen. After a long while, he felt suddenly clear and unburdened.\n\nHe traveled far to meet Lord Mao. Upon their encounter, his skeletal frame rose nobly, and his pupils became square. Smiling faintly, Lord Mao said, \"You have come. Your name is already recorded in the registers of immortality, and you have encountered demonic trials. Thus, I rescued you to spare you harm. You should set your mind on aiding others and assisting the Daoist teachings.\"\n\nThereafter, on Mount Qingcheng, he received from Zhao Yuanyang the arts of *dunjia* and *buxuan*. From Wei Shanjun of Songgao, he learned the Way of the Eight Histories and Cloud Steeds. Later, he entered Mount Meng to seek hidden arts. On the mountain path, he encountered a feathered scholar who asked, \"Where are you bound?\"\n\nThe Perfected Person replied, \"I seek a master to study the Dao.\"\n\nThe feathered scholar said, \"I, too, study the Dao. What fortune to meet you here! I must briefly depart for another place. I have a small bundle of plain garments—would you guard it for me?\"\n\nThe Perfected Person said, \"Very well.\"\n\nThe feathered scholar then departed. After several days, he returned and said, \"You are truly a man of integrity. I wish to repay you with a scroll of immortal scriptures and a divine sword.\" He opened the bundle and bestowed them upon him.\n\nThe feathered scholar took his leave, saying, \"Simply hold these and practice accordingly. In time, visions will gradually appear, and you will foreknow good and evil. You must also compound the divine elixir, set up the altar, and raise the sacred turtle. After several years of devoted practice and spiritual communion, on the night of the first *jia* day of the tenth month, he burned incense and made his vows. Suddenly, he heard the sounds of bells, chimes, flutes, strings, and panpipes resonating in the air.\n\nRising to look, he saw in an instant that the room was filled with riders. Among them were three divine beings, each over eight feet tall, with extraordinary countenances. They wore cloud-brocade robes and *tongtian* crowns. The Perfected Person prostrated himself and reverently entreated them.\n\nOne of the divine beings said, \"Simply resume your seat and do not fear. The Most High has sent us to inform you that you are destined to attain the Dao. In a former life, you were the Left Palace Immortal Recorder of the Purple Tenuity of the Great Ultimate, charged with recording the names of all immortals and those who attained the Dao under heaven, tallying their years and merits, and submitting reports thrice monthly. Due to a lapse in vigilance, you once wandered the Eight Wastes during a day of leisure. For this, you were sent down to the mortal world to further cultivate merit and accumulate virtue. When your deeds are complete, you shall reclaim your immortal rank.\n\nNow, you practice the rites of the Three-Five Alliance and the Orthodox Unity, slaying demons and malevolent spirits, rescuing those afflicted by drought, bestowing alms upon the poor, and administering justice on behalf of Heaven. Let hidden virtue be your foremost concern; no additional offerings or petitions are required. I have secret methods to transmit to you, but you must purify yourself for three days and ensure no worldly person knows of this. Receive my oral instructions—do not commit them to writing, lest they fall into unworthy hands. To lightly divulge the decrees of the Emperor would implicate seven generations of your ancestors, barring their ascent to the heavens.\"\n\nThereupon, the divine being bestowed upon him talismans, a sword, seals, and stamps.\n\nAnother divine being said, \"Now that you have retired from true rank and descended to the mortal world, you should broadly establish merit and virtue. Receive further the talismanic charts of the Five Peaks, the Celestial August Script, the Three-One Perfected Scripture, the Yellow Court and Purple Writ, the Eight Effulgences and Plain Writ, and the secret and wondrous arts of *bunie* and *chengji*. All the Upper Clarity, Upper Dharma, and Upper Perfection of the Three Caverns must be diligently cultivated, morning and evening without fail. Hold fast to the *Five Thousand Character Scripture*, govern the human Dao, and discern the principles of Heaven and Earth. Do not lightly divulge these teachings, and the Dao shall naturally be accomplished.\"\n\nYet another divine being said, \"The subtle wonders of the Supreme Dao cannot be expressed in words. You must guard the One and cast aside arrogance and excess. Regularly sound the bells and drums, harmonize the Three Principles and Passes, practice guiding and pulling, exhale the old and inhale the new, and ingest both inner and outer elixirs. Constantly embrace and store the sun and moon, open and close the gates, and cultivate the Most High at dawn. Then shall the Vermilion Radiance subtly illuminate you, and the Essenceless and White Prime shall come to guard you. When the Yellow and Lao present their records and your merit is complete, you shall surely ascend. You have received these words—practice without weariness. When the appointed time draws near, we shall meet again on the northern peak of the Xu family’s Jingyang Lord’s estate.\"\n\nThe Perfected Person prostrated himself and gave thanks, saying, \"My conduct is slight and my virtue meager. I did not comprehend the celestial truth, yet you have deigned to descend in your numinous chariot—this is beyond my expectations. I reverently accept your teachings and shall devote myself to their practice.\"\n\nHe bowed twice and took his leave. The divine beings then soared into the sky and departed.\n\nFrom then on, he practiced hidden virtue in secret, delivering the living and the dead. When he healed illnesses in Kuaiji, he repeatedly revived the dead.\n\nAgain in Yangzhou, he opened the abdomen of the Prefect’s Lady with his sword, extracting the ailment to show the onlookers—whereupon the Lady’s illness immediately abated as before. Whenever he split open bowels or exchanged stomachs, or cut open bellies to reshape forms, there was never any harm done, nor any pain suffered. He would pry out an eye, wash the pupil, and place it upon paper; removing the membrane and cataracts, he would then restore it to its socket—without the slightest disturbance, and the eye would see as clearly as before. If people pressed money upon him, he would beg it for the poor and sick. Wherever mad spirits or licentious sacrifices wrought calamity, wherever his steps fell, he would execute them all. His name spread far and near, and all came to know of him.\n\nSummons arrived time and again; he repeatedly declined, refusing to comply, but was reluctantly compelled to attend the imperial court. When Emperor Gaozong saw him, he did not require him to observe the rites of a subject. Serene and still, he showed no sign of life, save for faint breathing. The Emperor asked, “Are you unwell?” He replied, “My illness lies in the marketplace and court; my cure lies in the mountains and forests. I beg to withdraw and live in seclusion.” The Emperor said, “This is but a reclusive man.” He issued an edict appointing him Supreme Minister, but the Perfected Person firmly declined and did not bow in acceptance. He said, “I wish to leave the household life. I beg to be made a Daoist priest.” The Emperor then assented, ordaining him at Jinglong Abbey. He often remained in the inner palace, where the Emperor questioned him on the Dao and its methods, plumbing their deepest mysteries. Matters of fortune and misfortune, good and ill—he foresaw them all, and his words never missed their mark.\n\nWhen Hei He rebelled, the sovereign was filled with dread, at a loss for what to do. He asked the Perfected Person, “How may this be averted and remedied?” The reply came: “This petty bandit is no cause for concern.” Thereupon, with talismanic arts, he summoned tens of thousands of celestial soldiers, who descended veiled in darkness, their armor and blades clashing as they routed the rebels in flight. The Emperor said, “In defending the altars of state, you have rendered great service.” He repeatedly bestowed gifts of favor, but the Perfected Person declined them all, saying, “This is the work of the Dao and the divine; what part have I in it?”\n\nAt that time, the daughter of a Palace Secretary was afflicted by a fox spirit, driven to madness and raving, speaking in ghostly tongues and uttering eerie prophecies. Each time the girl saw a monk riding a blue mule approach, her illness would flare up. The family urgently entreated the master to treat her. The Perfected Person wished to display his divine transformations.\n\nThe Perfected Person said to the Palace Secretary, “This poor Daoist has fasted for many days, weary and feeble. If I might partake of a hearty meal, I shall then proceed with the treatment.” The Palace Secretary immediately ordered his household to prepare a vegetarian repast. The Perfected Person consumed a *hu* of rice in a single sitting and three *shi* of cakes. Fruits, melons, and vegetables were devoured beyond count; all who witnessed it were astonished, yet he still claimed he had not eaten his fill.\n\nBefore he could begin the ritual, the monk riding the mule arrived. Upon seeing the Perfected Person, he immediately turned and fled. The Perfected Person commanded his celestial officers and soldiers to seize him. From afar, the girl cried out in loud wails. With a great shout, the Perfected Person transformed the monk into a fox and the mule into a dog. Upon interrogation, the fox revealed, “My lair lies in an ancient tomb south of the city.” They went and excavated the site, uncovering over a hundred foxes. Gold, silver, silks, and brocades lay scattered within. They also recovered three volumes of scriptures: *The Genealogy of Wild Fox Spirits*, *Ranks and Titles*, and *Registers of Names*. The Perfected Person inscribed talismans and burned them. All the fox spirits were instantly eradicated. Thereafter, all afflicted within the city were cured.\n\nThe Emperor, the Empress, the imperial princes, princesses, and officials of the court, along with their subordinates, personally received the Daoist teachings. The sons of high ministers, Daoists from the capital and various prefectures—those who studied scriptures and methods under the Perfected Person—numbered several thousand in total. Nobles’ offerings filled the roads and overflowed the streets. Whatever he received, he dedicated to the abbeys: adorning sacred images, aiding the destitute, and relieving the poor. Each day, he cooked over ten *shi* of rice to feed the sick and impoverished, turning none away.\n\nThe Perfected Person ever held in his heart the resolve to offer forthright remonstrance and safeguard the altars of state.\n\nEmperor Gaozong wished to perform the *feng* and *shan* sacrifices to announce his achievements and visit Mount Song, the Central Peak. Suddenly, an epidemic spread, and many of those accompanying the imperial procession fell ill and died. The Emperor ordered the Perfected Person to treat the affliction. With a single incantation and talisman, the epidemic vanished, and those on the verge of death all revived. By special decree, he was appointed Supervisor of the Palace Administration, but the Perfected Person again declined the position.\n\nAt the time, there was a court attendant named Ming Zhengjian who, whenever dispatched, would send underworld officials to the celestial courts to verify matters. In an instant, they would return to report on good and evil, never missing their appointed time. The Emperor secretly ordered the Master to suppress him. When asked, Zhengjian knew nothing. After several days, he said, \"The emissaries have not come.\" The Emperor commanded the Venerable Master to release him. Zhengjian then said, \"They report being detained at the Heavenly Gate by Master Ye, unable to ascend.\"\n\nThe Emperor then had a pit secretly dug and musicians sent into it to play music. He said to the Master, \"There are inexplicable sounds from beneath the earth. Please suppress and dispel them.\" The Perfected Person inscribed four talismans and nailed them to the ground, and the sounds ceased. He then demanded of the musicians in the pit, \"Why do you not play?\" They reported, \"We see serpents in the four directions, each as thick as a pillar, opening their mouths to bite us. Terrified, we dare not move.\"\n\nAt that time, a drought occurred, and the Emperor commanded the Perfected Person to pray for rain at the river. The Master said, \"Bring your finest rain garments and ceremonial canopies, and follow me.\" The people did not believe him. Yet as soon as the prayers concluded, rain fell like mist, soaking the clothes and caps of men and horses alike.\n\nOne day, he urged the Emperor to temporarily leave his sleeping quarters to avoid disaster. Initially skeptical, the Emperor relented only after the Perfected Person insisted. Once he had moved, wind, rain, thunder, and lightning struck the former sleeping quarters, shattering the imperial tent. The Emperor was deeply shaken. Many other verified events are too numerous to record.\n\nThough the Perfected Person moved within the vermilion gates, aiding the times and assisting the state, he concealed his traces, blending with the world while his heart remained set on the Daoist path. Yearning for transcendence, he sought to return to the mountains. The Emperor finally granted his request.\n\nHe traveled to Mount Mao, Gusu, Dongting, Tianmu, Tiantai, and Kuocang, among other places. On Mount Mao, he cultivated the Dao and refined elixirs, never failing in his morning audiences. On the first day of the fifth month, an old man came to his door, weeping and begging for help. The Perfected Person invited him in and asked what troubled him.\n\nThe old man said, \"I am a dragon of the Eastern Sea. The Celestial Thearch has appointed me to guard the treasures of the Eight Seas, rotating the duty every thousand years. Those without fault ascend to the ranks of immortals. I have served for nine hundred and seventy years, and my term is nearly complete. A Brahmin sorcerer has been practicing his illusions by the sea, chanting spells day and night for twenty years. His magic is about to take effect: the sea will rise like clouds to the heavens. On the fifth day of the fifth month, the sea will dry up, and the treasure that governs the seas and stabilizes the heavens will be seized by the sorcerer. I beg for your aid.\"\n\nThe Perfected Person agreed. At noon on the fifth day, he sent forth a flying talisman from his elixir cauldron, and the sea returned to its former state. The Brahmin sorcerer, ashamed and sighing, threw himself into the sea and died. The next day, the old man and his kin brought rare treasures to express their gratitude, but the Perfected Person declined them all. He then said, \"This mountain is far from water. If I could have a spring, it would be a great kindness.\"\n\nThat very day, as wind and rain passed, a clear spring emerged beside the mountain lodge, flowing from a stone channel. Even in drought, it never ran dry. Today, it is called the Celestial Master’s Channel. In the regions beneath Siming and east of Tiantai, wherever the Perfected Person resided, altars were established and wells dug.\n\nAt the summit of Maoshan, he first built a mountain retreat, which was later bestowed the plaque *Tongtian Abbey*. In the third year of the *Dazhong Xiangfu* era, it was renamed *Shouchang Abbey*. To the northwest of the abbey stood the Elixir-Refining Well, and at the mountain’s base, a sacred spring. Near the spring was the Ritual Kitchen, where scholars and commoners came to pray.\n\nIn the first year of the *Zhiping* era, it was renamed *Shousheng Abbey*, and later changed to *Guangfu Abbey*. Once, the Perfected Person traveled to Qingxi during the scorching summer. With fellow Daoists, he wandered along the river islets. Suddenly, he submerged into the water and did not resurface for seven days. His companions, alarmed, believed he had been devoured by a flood dragon. They returned to inform his household and disciples, both Daoist and lay, who all searched along the riverbank.\n\nAfter seven days, he unexpectedly emerged from the very spot where he had entered. He said, \"You must have been frightened. I briefly visited Penglai with the River Earl, where several immortals were feasting. Fearing you would worry, I hastened back—just as you see.\" He then entered Tiantai to seek Master Alchemist Sima, visiting the immortal gardens of undying bliss.\n\nPassing through Tongwu and Lingxu, he said to Master Alchemist Sima, \"Beneath the towering pines, upon the lush grasses—today, this is our resting place.\" Ascending Huading Peak to gaze at the sea, he remarked, \"Penglai is not far from here. You and I shall return there someday.\" Master Alchemist Sima carried his zither, while the Perfected Person wielded his sword. Crossing the stone bridge and facing the ten-thousand-*ren* abyss of Qingxi, they treaded perilous paths, leaning against the jade-green cliffs—what had they to fear?\n\nIn the *xinchou* year, Empress Wu Zetian summoned the Perfected Person to cast dragon tablets and gather herbs, praying at famous mountains and great rivers. His carriage flew like the wind, and his retinue stretched endlessly. Later, during the reign of Emperor Zhongzong, Wu Sansi still held power, and the court was rife with slander. The Perfected Person repeatedly remonstrated, but his words displeased the Emperor, and he was exiled to the lands beyond the ridges. His disciples grew anxious, but the Perfected Person said, \"Fortune and misfortune come in their time. This is simply how it must be.\"\n\nHe traveled to Mount Heng, then to Lianzhou, still hundreds of *li* from Guangzhou, where the land route was impassable and a boat was required. Wishing to gather herbs in Guangzhou, he first sent his disciples ahead by boat. Daoists at the Yitang Abbey heard of his arrival and rushed to inform Prefect Hu Yuanli, who, along with Daoists, monks, nuns, and local officials, went to the riverbank to welcome him.\n\nSoon after, they saw the Perfected Person riding a white horse across the water. Upon reaching the shore, they exchanged greetings and escorted him to Longxing Abbey.\n\nThe Prefect, Vice-Prefect, Chief Clerk, and common folk all received the Daoist teachings. Many donated gardens, groves, fields, and residences, but the Perfected Person accepted nothing, returning all to the abbey’s permanent endowment.\n\nLater, an imperial decree arrived, ordering his transfer to Hongzhou, where he resided at Zonghua Abbey. Taking his disciples, he entered the Western Mountains to the abode of Master Hongya, where he dwelled for three years, practicing the Hidden Methods of Supreme Clarity.\n\nIn the fourth year of Jinglong (recorded in the annals as the second year of Jingyun), the year *xinhai*, on the sixth night of the third month, a disciple dreamed of an immortal leading a crane, who asked, “Who are you?” The immortal replied, “I am a man of this time and shall not reveal my name.” Pointing to the disciple, he said, “You are fortunate to have the Left Palace Immortal Minister as your master. The Emperor will soon summon him, and word will come.” The crane led by the immortal circled and danced gracefully. Upon waking, the disciple reported this to the Perfected Person, who said, “You must have dreamed—this is an auspicious sign, and I already know its meaning.”\n\nAt noon on the ninth day, auspicious clouds, celestial music, and a fragrant aroma filled the air, drifting into the chamber. The disciples recognized the scene from the dream. The immortal addressed the Perfected Person: “Do you recognize me?” He replied, “I think of your true form day and night, as if parched with thirst. In my waking and dreaming, I always attend you—how could I not know you?” He bowed twice in reverence. The immortal said, “Your accumulated merit is nearly complete, but you must refine yourself further. When the Dao is lofty, demonic trials arise—you must be cautious. The Most High has commanded me to deliver the Golden Essence Elixir of Transformed Bones to you. The time is not yet ripe, so do not consume it; keep it hidden.”\n\nThe immortal continued, “By the eighth month, you will enter the capital to assist the reigning Emperor and the future *Kaishen Shenwu Emperor*, transmitting the Daoist teachings and eliminating the chief villain. The nation’s fortunes are precarious, but the dragon’s ascent is imminent. You must aid the state, pacify the sacred mountains and rivers, and perform the *Toulong* Offering—this duty falls to you, as Heaven protects you. Though you will receive worldly honors and ranks, even a fiefdom, your inner position will manifest outwardly, like a shadow following form. In the year of the Quail’s Tail, the month of the Quail’s Fire, at noon on the third day, the Western Peak Attendant Minister will restore you to the position of Left Palace Immortal Minister of the Purple Tenuity in the Supreme Ultimate.”\n\nThe Perfected Person bowed and replied, “I am of base and foolish nature, undeserving of such favor. If I fail in this later duty, it would be like an ant trying to move a mountain—I would be unworthy. How could I repay such grace, even if I ground my bones to dust?” He bowed twice more and took his leave.\n\nIn the eighth month, an edict arrived: “Daoist Master Ye is to enter the capital. If he has disciples, they may accompany him.” The Perfected Person, having received the decree, traveled by post to the capital. After his audience, he remained often in the inner court. At the time, the future Emperor Xuanzong was in his princely residence, and the Perfected Person stayed with him. They conducted rites at the Dragon Manifestation Altar, and all prayers were answered—snow accumulated a foot deep, and requests for rain or frost were fulfilled. Once, on Mount Lu, as he ascended the altar, water gushed from the earth at its corners, sweet and clear, while cranes and herbs danced. At the residence of Master Xu, during a rite, two yellow dragons emerged from a well.\n\nThe Perfected Person aided Xuanzong in Mingzhou, where he foresaw the rebellion of the Wei clan and had already reported the *Xiantian* prophecy, all of which proved true. Xuanzong once asked him about essential matters, and he replied in secret, “I once met an immortal who spoke of the *Kaiyuan* imperial title.” He knew in advance of all conspirators. When Xuanzong ascended the throne, he changed the era name to *Kaiyuan* and styled himself the *Shenwu Emperor*. The Perfected Person remained by his side, advising on all matters, secretly offering profound counsel, eliminating harm, and vanquishing villains, his mysterious merit extending far and wide.\n\nThe Chancellor Yao Chong’s daughter had died, and his grief was profound. The Perfected Person cast a talisman, reviving her. The wife of Magistrate Zhang had died and transformed into a revenant, reuniting with her husband. The Perfected Person recognized this and said, “This is the affliction of corpse enchantment. If not swiftly removed, Magistrate Zhang will die.” He cast a talisman, and the revenant dissolved into black qi.\n\nAt the Qiantang River, a giant clam drowned boats and troubled travelers. The chief of Qingsha Town, Shen Yu, personally came to welcome the Perfected Person, who thus went there. When the tide arrived, he subdued the clam with an iron talisman and cinnabar script, and the menace ceased to this day. He also inscribed the characters *Daojing* (“Daoist Serenity”) on a cliff with his sword, each character spanning over three *zhang*. The original inscriptions remain, at the mountain now called the Gate of the Three Teachings.\n\nXuanzong moved his retinue to the Shangyang Palace to view lanterns. The imperial artisans, led by Mao Yi, constructed over thirty pavilions adorned with gold, kingfisher feathers, pearls, and jade, towering over a hundred *zhang*. A gentle breeze made them chime harmoniously, and lanterns shaped like dragons and phoenixes seemed beyond mortal craft. Xuanzong was delighted and summoned the Perfected Person to view them below. The Perfected Person said, “The splendor of these lanterns is unmatched, yet the lanterns of the Western Capital tonight are nearly as grand. However, such extravagance is of no benefit to the state.”\n\nThe Emperor, surprised by his words, wished to test his immortal arts and said, “I would like to go there now. Is that possible?” The Perfected Person replied, “It is easy, but for Your Majesty to travel far to view lanterns is not fitting.” The Emperor insisted. The Perfected Person asked him to close his eyes, and in an instant, they ascended. When they arrived, the Perfected Person used his *ruyi* scepter to toast the Emperor. As they prepared to return, he again asked the Emperor to close his eyes, and in a moment, they were back beneath the pavilion, where the music and dance had not yet ended. Later, the Emperor sent a eunuch on an errand to the Western Capital, instructing him to retrieve the *ruyi* scepter as proof—it was not a lie.\n\nOn the night of the full moon in the eighth month, he accompanied the Emperor to the Lunar Palace, where they listened to celestial music. When asked the name of the melody, he replied, “*Ziyun* (Purple Cloud).” The Emperor, skilled in music, memorized the tune and later composed it in the Music Bureau, renaming it “*Nishang Yuyi* (Rainbow Skirts and Feathered Robes).”\n\nReturning from the Lunar Palace, they passed over Tengzhou. Gazing down, the city walls stood sheer in the moonlight, bright as day. The Perfected Person then asked the Emperor to play a tune on his jade flute. At the time, the jade flute still lay in the imperial bedchamber, but the Perfected Person dispatched a spirit to retrieve it, and in an instant, it arrived. After the melody was played, he cast golden coins into the city below before departing.\n\nTen days later, a memorial arrived from Jizhou reporting that on the night of the full moon in the eighth month, celestial music had descended upon the city, and golden coins had been recovered and presented. The Emperor repeatedly tested the Perfected Person’s divine arts in the presence of his close ministers—none were illusions or tricks. Whether vanishing into pillars, transforming into cranes midair, summoning mountain spirits, or calling forth wind and rain, his miraculous feats were too numerous to recount.\n\nAt that time, Tubo envoys presented a treasure casket, sealed and inscribed: *“Let Your Majesty open it personally—let no other know the secret.”* The court fell silent. Only the Perfected Person declared, *“This is an ominous object. Order the Tubo envoy to open it himself.”* When the command was given and the casket opened, a crossbow bolt sprang forth, striking the envoy dead. The Emperor sighed in shock and dread, and from then on, his reverence for the Perfected Person only deepened.\n\nIn the eighth month of the second year of the Xiantian era, the Perfected Person was granted the titles of *Jinzi Guanglu Daifu*, *Honglu Qing*, and Duke of Yue. Thrice he declined the honors, but the Emperor would not permit it. The imperial edict read in part:\n\n*“The Daoist Ye Fashan’s virtue encompasses purity and constancy; his learning delves into the profound and subtle. Foreseeing omens before they arise, he has expressed his loyal devotion. It is fitting to bestow these honors in recognition of his meritorious deeds. Thus, let his wishes be fulfilled, and let him don the garb of the Perfected.”*\n\nThe edict conferred upon him the titles of *Jinzi Guanglu Daifu*, *Honglu Qing*, Duke of Yue, and Abbot of Jinglong Abbey. Though the Perfected Person declined, his refusal was not accepted. He then requested that the honors be posthumously bestowed upon his late father and offered his ancestral home at the gate of Kuocang Mountain. He petitioned for the establishment of Xuanyang Abbey, stipulating that all ritual offerings, rare treasures, and imperial gifts be dedicated to the mountain sanctuary. Xuanyang Abbey, located in Xuanci Township of Lishui County, was later renamed Chongzhen Abbey.\n\nHis father was posthumously granted the title of *Yinqing Guanglu Daifu* and appointed *Shi Chi Jie*, Prefect of Shezhou. He further requested that his ancestral residence on the southwest slope of Maoshan be converted into an abbey, which the Emperor named *Chunhe*. Situated in Rishi of Songyang County, it was later renamed Yongning Abbey.\n\nThereafter, the Perfected Person sought to return to the mountains to pay respects at the graves of his ancestors. At the tombs in Lishui and Songyang, he erected steles and planted trees. He commissioned Li Yong to compose the epitaph, while Han Zemu inscribed it to adorn the sacred burial site. His own tomb lies beside Chongzhen Abbey.\n\nHis great-grandfather, Guo Zhong, was interred on the western slope of Songyang’s You Mountain, where a stone cock was said to crow. A Daoist sanctuary was established there, now known as Tianzhen Abbey, with a stele erected at its base. At the time, Li Yong was again requested to compose the inscription and provide the calligraphy, but he refused. That very night, his spirit was summoned to inscribe it, and the completed stele was later presented to him.\n\nLi Yong laughed and said, \"At first I thought it a dream, but now it proves true indeed.\"\n\nThe Perfected Person had initially obtained the stele stone from Haijiao, where he dispatched spirit messengers to transport it back. The river deities, unaware, accidentally split the stone. He then cast a talisman to remedy it, and the river deities pleaded for mercy, thus spared. The broken edges were mended with glue, and the fracture marks remain visible on the stele to this day.\n\nWhen the Perfected Person sealed the tomb, planted trees, and performed the memorial rites, springs and rocks radiated brilliance, and the villages and borders rejoiced. In the fifth year of the Kaiyuan era, the cyclical year *dingsi*, in the third lunar month, he took leave of his fellow villagers, saying, \"Parting is easy, reunion difficult—after this departure, I fear we shall not meet again.\" His attendants were dismayed, while Daoists and layfolk wept silently. Chariots and horses thronged the roads, and men and women lined the way in an unbroken stream. As they saw him off on his journey, none could contain their grief.\n\nHe added, \"Next year, I shall send word back. Await it here, for when the message arrives, my return will not be long after.\" The following year, on the twenty-seventh day of the first lunar month, suddenly hundreds of black cranes appeared, arrayed from the north, circling and alighting at Ouxi. They lingered for three days, while auspicious clouds of five colors gathered above. After three days, they vanished without a trace.\n\nThe villagers marveled at his wondrous words, unable to fathom their origin. In the eighth year of the Kaiyuan era, the geng-yin year, in the fifth lunar month, the Perfected One had already reached the age of one hundred and seven. At the Jinglong Abbey in the Western Capital, he feigned illness and secretly ingested the divine elixir. Celestial immortals came and went; a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders passed day and night without cease. His disciples, princely kin, imperial envoys, and court officials came and went unnoticed. Only his disciples Jun Qing and Lu Qiwu witnessed the mystery in secret, saying nothing.\n\nOn the third day of the sixth lunar month, at the hour of noon on the jiashen day, the Perfected One transformed his sword into a corpse, and a cloud-borne chariot arrived at his gate. Heavenly music filled the doorway, colorful clouds swirled, and fragrant vapors billowed forth as he was borne away in attendance. The people of the capital all saw a column of blue smoke rising straight from the abbey, reaching the heavens and lingering all day without dissipating.\n\nBeside his seat, the Perfected One left three poems:\n\n*Of old in the Yu-Yu Heaven,*\n*I returned to the home of the Supreme.*\n*Humbly entrusted with the register of immortals,*\n*I came and went riding the mist and clouds.*\n*For a time I descended to Wanli City,*\n*Vaguely longing for Golden Flower Peak.*\n*From now on, I shall not tarry long—*\n*I ascend the fragrant chariot into the clouds.*\n\n*Recently I came to the world of men,*\n*From time to time aiding the common folk.*\n*My work of delivering souls now complete,*\n*My service to the state also fulfilled.*\n*Yet I yearn for the joys of the Pure and Subtle—*\n*Who would prize the glory of the mortal realm?*\n*Disciples, fare well in this place,*\n*For I now ascend in clouds to the heights.*\n\n*I withdrew from immortality in this land,*\n*Long since leaving the vulgar world’s glory.*\n*Today I ascend to the clouded heavens,*\n*Returning to truth in the Supreme Clarity.*\n*The mud-pill palace I left as a sign for the world,*\n*My ascent is not for fame.*\n*Let this report be made to those who seek the Dao:*\n*Know that I now journey to the Jade Capital.*\n\nHe also left a letter for his disciple Zhongrong, saying: *\"Present my poems and this letter to the throne. Do not seek office, but attend to the funeral rites for the Imperial Music Bureau, then return to bury me in Guacang. One hundred and sixty years after my departure, a man shall emerge from Maoshan who will surpass even me. If someone practices the Dao in my former dwelling, that shall be the one.\"*\n\nThe Perfected One once concealed his sword and elixir beneath a great boulder on Maoshan. Later, Feng Qushe cultivated the Dao there, found them, and thus attained immortality and departed. Now the mountain yields immortal mushrooms and nameless marvels—transformations of the cinnabar radiance left upon the earth.\n\nAfter the Perfected One ascended in clouds, his disciples gathered the poems and letters from his former seat and presented them to the throne. The emperor was moved to tears and personally visited the mourning site, suspending court for three days. From princes and ministers down to all officials and scholars, none failed to grieve deeply. The following day, he posthumously bestowed the title of Governor of Yuezhou. On the sixteenth day, he ordered an imperial portrait of the Perfected One to be painted from memory, and composed an encomium that read:\n\n*\"By the river, essence flows forth,\nIn the garden of virtue, fragrance abides.\nBeyond these, the true qi—\nFrom azure streams, clouds arise.\nPeerless, unmatched,\nTranscendent, unbound.\nO secluded sage, Daoist lord of feng.\"*\n\nEmperor Suzong added his own eulogy:\n\n*\"Lofty and proud, the noble scholar,\nFree and solitary, towering high.\nStanding apart, brushing aside the mist,\nRiding the rainbow, steering the carp.\nFruitful yet unboastful,\nActing yet unattached.\nMounting the wind, serene,\nEver in harmony with all things.\"*\n\nAn imperial edict was also issued, fully recorded in He Zhizhang’s *Preface to the Record of the Mystic Void*. It ordained that the Perfected One’s disciple, Sima Zhongrong, be tonsured as a Daoist priest at the Sacred Perfection Abbey in the Eastern Capital, and that imperial envoys escort the funeral procession to inter him beside the Xuan Yang Abbey. From princes and ministers down to all within the capital, they came forth beyond the Green Gate to bid farewell, the entire city clad in white, all weeping and wailing in sorrow.\n\nUpon reaching Yangzhou, word arrived first from the unseen realm: hundreds of cranes soared above the Grotto-Heaven tomb fields of Guacang. Five-colored clouds lingered for days, not dispersing for half a month. When the Perfected One’s spirit carriage arrived at the burial site, officials and commoners from Qu, Zi, Hang, and the three prefectures—Daoists and laypeople, men and women—came and went like a bustling market. Thousands of disciples wailed without cease. A hundred birds cried in mourning.\n\nFrom all directions they gathered in clouds. Heaven altered its hue, and the sun too lost its light. A year after the burial, the coffin opened of its own accord, revealing only robes, cap, sword, and shoes—thus was it known that the Perfected One had not died, but merely ascended lightly in transcendence. The Emperor, ever cherishing the immortal’s bearing, remained endlessly nostalgic. At the abbey, he erected a stele adorned with imperial calligraphy and commanded the Crown Prince to inscribe its title. By the sixth year of Zhenghe in our present dynasty, the Perfected One was specially enfeoffed as Master of the Dao *Zhixu Jiansu*. In the second year of Xuanhe, he was further honored as Perfected *Lingxu Jiansu*. The imperial edicts are preserved at *Chongzhen* in Lishui.\n\nHereafter are compiled the stele inscription composed by Li Yong, along with the Perfected One’s memorials and petitions, imperial rescripts and decrees, and genealogical records.\n\n**Memorial Requesting Return to Hometown**\nYour Daoist servant [so-and-so] humbly states: Your servant is a rustic of rivers and seas, one who has long lacked Daoist cultivation. I have drunk from streams and eaten of trees, dwelling in withered seclusion. Yet when the sagely court opened the gates of the Dao and greatly exalted the mystic model, I was blessed to bathe in the imperial transformation. Serving five reigns, I exhausted loyalty and sincerity, baring my liver and dripping my gall. If I could but render the slightest aid, I would harbor no regret even in ten thousand deaths.\n\nWhen Your Majesty’s sagely court re-established the realm and once more stabilized all beings, every creature possessing consciousness was revived and renewed. Though Your Majesty did not disdain this coarse grass, again gathering me beneath the imperial cap and slippers, my dullness and rusticity were over-rewarded with profound grace. I was falsely entrusted with office among the thorns and brambles, further honored with a fief of thatched simplicity. Praise and glory spread to the very borders, blessings overflowing like springs and seas. Yet how could this face of mine bear such great creation? Even if I ground my body to ashes or severed my head, I could not repay it.\n\nIn a previous year, the celestial grace granted me return to my hometown. My remnant soul, borrowing breath, was able to bow at my ancestral graves, gathering clan and kin in shared sorrow and joy. Yet my parents, now in their declining years—over a hundred and thirty years old—upon seeing this servant return to the hills and valleys, were at once overjoyed and sorrowful. Scarcely ten days passed before they suddenly departed. Though life and death are decreed by fate and principle is thus fixed, flesh and blood share feeling—how could there be no grief? The ailments of many years erupted in a single morning. My form and countenance withered and weakened, scarcely able to endure what once was.\n\nHaving reverently received the imperial edict, I was commanded to offer jade tablets and dragon figurines. After fulfilling this mission, ritual propriety demands that I report back in person—my heart races toward the towering palace gates, my intent fixed on swift return. Yet illness lingers in these riverlands, and my strength fails to bear me thither.\n\nSince departing the southern lands in the final days of winter two years past, only by the first month of last summer did I reach the Eastern Capital. My steps, though but a remnant soul’s, defy all description. How could one so withered in form, so afflicted in heart, presume to occupy this rank? The purple sash and golden seal mark the highest honor for a minister—unless one’s merit is towering, such emblems of enduring favor cannot be bestowed. Yet the Dao in its essence dwells in the formless and soundless, beyond sight or hearing. To have been so grievously misfitted for this office is to have truly tarnished the kingdom’s way.\n\nI humbly beseech Your Majesty to grant this remnant soul leave to return to the hills and ancestral tombs. Thus may all things fulfill their nature, and heaven’s boundless grace extend without limit. Though I must now depart from the court, my longing clings to it still. My prayers are beyond measure—with utmost reverence, I present this memorial at the palace hall for Your Majesty’s consideration.\n\nThis servant, in awe and trembling, prostrates himself in fear and dread. A thousand deaths, a thousand deaths—this unworthy scholar presents himself thus.\n\nMemorial submitted on the twenty-first day of the second month, the fourth year of the Kaiyuan era. By the Minister of the Court of State Ceremonial, Extraordinary Appointment, Duke of Yue, Abbot of Jinglong Abbey—your servant, Ye [given name omitted].\n\nImperial Rescript: The memorial has been received and noted in full.\n\nThe master’s plume adorns the azure vault; the bridge spans the gate of mystery.\n\nThough lately bound to the mortal realm, my spirit transcends all worldly entanglements. I had hoped to receive the essential teachings of the Three Clarities, to proclaim the harmony of the Six Qi, and to offer these to Your Majesty’s person, aiding in the governance of the realm. Moreover, the principle of radiant felicity resides in the manifold mysteries. Yet the vastness of my devotion, like the rivers and seas, finds no fulfillment in this request. You would do well to sever this petition and deeply consider my sentiments.\n\n**Memorial of the Perfected One Seeking to Return Home to Repair Ancestral Tombs**\nYour servant, the Daoist Minister [name omitted], respectfully states: On the twentieth day of the second month, though afflicted by illness, I laid bare my sincerity and specially beseeched that my lingering soul be permitted to return home to repair the ancestral tombs. Yet the lofty heavens did not heed, and the earth beneath me offered no refuge. Thus, my old ailments flared, and my remaining life hung by a thread. Before I could take leave of this sagely age, I was suddenly transformed into another being. Fortunately, by the boundless grace of Heaven’s nurturing embrace, I was not yet consigned to the yellow springs. My remaining life was spared, and my humble wish was granted.\n\nEarlier, I received the imperial edict permitting my return to my native place. Having treasured the dragon jade, I traversed mountains and rivers. Day and night, I was circumspect, reverently bearing the mandate of the state. Yet upon nearing my hometown, the season pressed with severe cold. Years of poor harvests had driven the people to flee, and my kin suffered from hunger. The rites of kinship were obscured, and my private wish to erect a stele could not be fulfilled. The stele stone still remains in Suzhou, unable to reach my hometown. My heart burns with anguish, my tears flow as blood, and each day feels like a year. If this wish remains unfulfilled, I shall not close my eyes in death.\n\nI humbly beseech Your Majesty, whose nurturing care extends even to the smallest creatures, allowing all to follow their nature. The teachings of filial piety reach all living beings. My skin and bones are but hollow vessels, my life as fleeting as a candle in the wind. I beg that my last breath may yet be granted. If my wish is heard, even the Nine Springs shall hold no regret. Though I must soon depart from the imperial presence, my illness lingers by rivers and lakes. Prostrate upon my sickbed, my grief and longing overflow. With utmost reverence, I present this memorial at the palace hall for Your Majesty’s consideration.\n\nYour servant, in awe and trembling, prostrates himself in fear and dread. A thousand deaths, a thousand deaths—this unworthy one presents himself thus.\n\nMemorial submitted on the twenty-third day of the second month, the fourth year of the Kaiyuan era. By the Minister in Attendance [name omitted].\n\n**Imperial Rescript:** The memorial has been received and noted in full. The master’s being embodies the manifold mysteries, his Dao surpassing that of the immortals. His subtlety and purity attain the true and clear. Through his aid, transformation is wrought. Yet his heartfelt plea, though made in illness, longs for return. His memorials have been repeatedly received, his words and sentiments ever more earnest. Now, in accordance with his request, his wish is granted.\n\n**Memorial of the Perfected One Seeking to Confer His Father’s Posthumous Title**\nI have heard that the greatness of filial piety is the foremost of human conduct. Thus, the vastness of Heaven’s embrace, though wordless, elicited a response from the divine maiden’s scroll. The boundless earth, though silent, manifested the river carp as an offering. Such is the resonance between the spirits and Heaven and Earth.\n\nI humbly reflect that Your Majesty’s filial devotion equals that of Heaven and Earth, your sageliness matching that of the gods. In Qi Prefecture, auspicious lingzhi mushrooms sprouted; at the imperial mausoleum, sweet dew descended. These are the responses to Your Majesty’s filial piety, and thus felicity should extend to all beings. I am fortunate to live in an age governed by filial principle, to witness with my own eyes these numinous signs. Yet I, possessing no merit greater than bending a blade of grass, have vainly received the gift of a thatched hut. The rank of the Nine Ministers is as vast as the rivers and seas; the title of the Five Orders corresponds to the stars and constellations. My days are numbered, and the yellow springs draw near. My parents, who gave me life, have yet to receive recompense for their toil. The grace Your Majesty has bestowed upon me is weightier than mountains.\n\nThough I am but a humble creature, how could I be without feeling? Since my shameful inclusion in the court’s ranks, I have lived in constant dread, day and night. In life, I have brought no benefit to this sagely age; in death, I shall truly betray this prosperous era. Yet the private sentiments of this old dog or aging horse run deep. I beseech that the titles and ranks bestowed upon me by Your Majesty be posthumously conferred upon my late father. Thus, I shall neither violate Your Majesty’s filial example nor fail to fulfill my own boundless devotion. If this wish is granted, even a thousand deaths would be a blessing.\n\nMoreover, my skin is wrinkled like a chicken’s, my hair white as a crane’s, my body thus reduced. My lingering soul borrows qi, but my end may come at any moment. Last winter, I took leave of the court and traveled by carriage, afflicted by illness. By Your Majesty’s nurturing virtue, I was spared and rejoiced in survival, permitted once more to approach the Purple Chamber and tread the Vermilion Steps. Now, with my remaining breath, I lay bare my humble sincerity.\n\nI beseech that the generous emoluments and wealth bestowed upon me be returned to the imperial treasury, and that the official titles and honorific names be conferred upon the gates of the netherworld. Thus, my clan shall gather in joy, and our ancestral line shall unite in heart and soul. In life and death, I would be most fortunate—words fail to express my gratitude.\n\nI humbly pray that Your Majesty’s compassion may abundantly permit this. Though my life cannot be restored, even a hundred bodies could not repay this debt. My grief and sorrow overflow, my entreaties know no end. With utmost reverence, I present this memorial at the palace gate for Your Majesty’s consideration.\n\nYour servant, in awe and trembling, prostrates himself in fear and dread. A thousand deaths, a thousand deaths—this unworthy one presents himself thus.\n\nMemorial submitted on the twenty-third day of the second month, the fourth year of the Kaiyuan era. By the Minister in Attendance [name omitted].\n\n**Imperial Rescript:** The memorial has been received and noted in full. The master’s name ascends to the immortal realms, his talents surpassing the pivot of the Dao. He has safeguarded my person. I do not forget the ranks and titles bestowed in the morning court. Matters of state are governed by impartiality. Having examined his petition and discerned his sentiments, I recognize the depth of his filial piety. I esteem and commend his virtue in fostering customs and elevating morals. The master’s reverence for yielding and humility makes it difficult to grant his request. The posthumous conferral he seeks shall be handled separately.\n\n**Stele Inscription of the Late Perfected Master Ye of the Dao**\n*Composed and inscribed by Li Yong of Jiangxia*\n\nOf old, the birth of the Venerable Lord unfolded the Dao, pure as Heaven and Earth. The birth of the Virtuous Master endowed him with a body bearing the sun and moon. Yet when the lords of the age did not honor him, and the masters of the time did not employ him, he concealed his brilliance in deep valleys, coiled his presence in secluded mountains. His hidden essence shed its earthly form, his plain integrity perpetuated the lineage of immortals. How could his avoidance of fate and conduct be merely rewarded with ranks and robes?\n\nThe Master’s personal name was Guozhong, his courtesy name Yazhen. He was a native of Yexian in Nanyang. From Shaohao, he inherited the blessings; from Gaoxin, he continued the lineage. Through the flourishing reign of Yao, and the sowing of Hou Ji, the descendants of King Wen received their fief in Shen. The son of Yin Shu was enfeoffed in Ye, where his clan received its surname and enjoyed the state’s favor. How vast and distant!\n\nHis ancestor, Qianyu, strengthened his plans and perpetually embodied virtue.\n\nThe Master refined his secluded chambers and sealed the gates to summon the myriad spirits. His physique was robust, his talents towering; he mastered principles and amassed arts. Though carriages of state arrived in succession, he steadfastly declined all offers. Thus, his blessed lineage flourished, and his years stretched long.\n\nHis father, Daoxing, guarded the inner courts by nature and disseminated the Dao throughout the realm. When dwelling among ghosts, he followed the earth; when leading as master, spirits followed heaven. He received the celestial registers with reverence, dispatched flying talismans to the north, and suppressed the malevolence of demons. He eradicated the curses of Liu Taidai—how extraordinary! As for drawing the bow to pierce grass and leather or leaping into wells to strike, he uniquely established the Five Departments, greatly expanding the refined and abundant. Who could succeed such a legacy?\n\nThe Master inherited the Daoist lineage with divine favor, receiving rare teachings and guidance. Though young in years and modest in appearance, he was devoted to the true and steadfast. His immortal bones bore signs, his childlike heart remained untainted. He concentrated on the Five Dragons and roamed the grassy peaks. His keen hearing discerned the distant, his bright vision perceived the subtle. He grasped the omens of life and death, embodied the transformations of qi and matter. Often, when stillness preserved essence and movement depleted it, he withdrew his shadow to return home. Beyond the clouds, he dwelled in secluded valleys; in the forests, he made his immortal abode. No neighbors approached, and the Way was treacherous to the right. Yet he journeyed alone to hidden wonders, forever singing the songs of reclusion. Free and at ease, he preserved harmony, practicing emptiness to attain stillness. He sipped the marrow of the Five Stones, plucked the blossoms of the Three Sacred Fungi. Time did not linger, and the seasons passed. Though his temples turned as black as lacquer, his youthful complexion remained flushed with cinnabar. His affairs aligned with the mysterious, his spirit merged with the Dao. In utter silence and vast stillness, he abstained from drink and food for decades. Thereupon, his fame reached the imperial court. The emperor’s favor surged, and he was honored with deference. They sent him literary steeds and swift chariots, but the Master lingered, gestured with a long bow, and waved his hand in high refusal. He said: \"Of old, when Emperor Shun was elevated, his virtue shone brightly. When Guangwu succeeded the throne, the governance of officials was most excellent. Moreover, Xue Fang and Feng Meng were accorded the rites of foreign ministers, while Yu Zhong and Yi Yi pursued the work of recluses. How could one sullied by the vulgar, flawed by worldly things, or partial in tribute—one whose nature inclines toward the Dao and admires its kind—sit idly to attain extraordinary longevity? The imperial envoys harbored doubts about my silence, yet I have fulfilled my intent to depart.\" He then surveyed the huts and granaries, examined his own body and flesh. He inspected the altars of the astronomers and inquired of his household servants about their duties. All were frugal and adhered to simplicity, maintaining their beginnings. Their food was not sweet to the palate, their appearance did not please the eye. Truly, they embodied sincerity and cast off falsehood, daring to uphold what was difficult to seize. If one could follow the wind, why force oneself to rise? Thus, he returned to the empty observatory to fulfill his destiny, ashamed to sigh at the news. The court longed for his loftiness, thirsted for his Dao, and listened for his praises. Those who yearned for him—how could words suffice?\n\nThe officials reported that the celestial records of the Heavenly Stem were incomplete, the astral offices neglected. The succession of the Five Virtues was lost, the divisions of the Four Seasons confused. Jing’s ghosts and Yue’s omens were unrecognized; the origins of *zi-hai* and *mu-gui* were unknown. All urgently sought him from afar, requesting transmission of the teachings. This could be called: \"When the plumb line is truly aligned, crooked and straight are revealed; when the scale is truly hung, light and heavy are established.\" Alas, among erudite scholars, how could such matters be mere trivial talk from rustic scholars?\n\nAlas! Heaven does not endure forever, and man must return. His declining years pressed toward a century, his distant aspirations thwarted by decay. He chose a burial site in a secluded valley, entrusting his tomb to a pure grove. The reclusive were not pursued, the state’s finest had no statutes to follow. Springs and stones mourned in discoloration, his homeland and county lost their voice. Was there no one else? It was because of him. His heir, Huiming, was posthumously granted the title of Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, Silver and Cyan, and Prefect of Shezhou. The Master never neglected his county, each generation enhancing its legacy. He unlocked the mysteries of secret records, spreading the great waves of the Dark Ford. The Dao was faint as an echo, the heart subtle as qi. Blowing the pitch-pipes warmed the valleys, calculating the calendar revealed heaven’s patterns. Though imperial summons arrived repeatedly, he never answered.\n\nHis grandson, the Daoist of Jinglong Abbey, Honglu Qing, Duke of Yue, and Fashan, received his father’s teachings early and inherited the perfected methods. Reverently mindful of his instructions, he surpassed near and far in his own person. He read the books of the world, prepared defenses beyond its borders. Fire cleansed excessive attachments, the sword slew demons in his grasp. His kindness opened the way for the Five Lords, his name stirred the Four Lands. When entering, he pushed aside golden rings and locks to pay homage at the Purple Court, serving as the emperor’s proud official. When departing, he followed the Jade Capital, sat in the Dark Temple, and became a master to all. Thus, he became the great artisan of the Daoist gate, the household minister of the court’s right. He dined with ritual at the carriage’s side, lodged in the forbidden precincts.\n\nHe always strengthened himself through the principles of qi, growing stronger with age. Though no shadow hastened his steps, his filial piety was most profound. He presented a memorial, wishing to visit his ancestral tomb. The emperor, moved by his words, twice issued royal decrees. Divine talismans flew, and auspicious transmissions were dispatched. The Duke of Zhangmao hosted a farewell banquet, while the feudal lords welcomed him beyond the suburbs. Courtly splendor shone, and his countrymen rejoiced. Though bending with lesser arts, he exalted his filial heart. In pursuing the former will to honor the distant, he erected a grand stele to record virtue. How could one ask why? Its inscription reads:\n\nThe lineage’s culture was pure in conduct, the family’s generations hidden immortals.\nThe Dao was one in mutual gestation, the torch passed in succession.\nThe Yellow Elder guarded the past, the Red Waters strung pearls.\nThe Dao unlocked hidden keys, nature merged with the true root.\nA single gate spanned ancestors, four directions endured a hundred years.\nThey defied traces in cliffs and valleys, silenced fame in heaven and earth.\nLofty and distant in their ascent, their noble bearing was radiant.\nMusk burns for its fragrance, pearls fall for their brilliance.\nMen have hearts, yet omens do not arrive.\nPreserving the self is no theft, preserving simplicity is profit.\nThe filial grandson enhanced the legacy, enlightened rulers followed the wind.\nHis aspirations were never unworthy, though affairs differed.\nSummons for worthies filled the court, recluses emptied the mountains.\nHow could one rest on high pillows, repaying the work of the age?\nPerceiving the subtle, grasping change, exhausting the rules to offer loyalty.\nThough imperial favor was profound, filial devotion ran deeper.\nOfficial robes gathered, transmitted arts flourished.\nThough he departed the court’s halls, he visited the tomb’s groves.\nInscribing stone to honor the distant, engraving words to express the heart.\nFilial piety and loyalty stood as affairs, glory and favor adorn the present.\n\nFar surpassing ancient origins, his eternal model graced the lands south of the Yangtze.\n\nIn the fifth year of the Kaiyuan reign, cyclical year *dingsi*, the seventh day of the third month, the attendant and abbot of Qingxi Abbey, Zhan Xuanyi, recorded this on the twelfth day.\n\nThe Perfected One had a stele at Zhenguan Abbey, where at its end was inscribed thus: as Master Li found it difficult to complete the calligraphy, the Perfected One summoned his spirit to inscribe it, hence the world calls it the \"Spirit-Summoned Stele.\" Some characters therein were miswritten. That night, as the hour grew late and the bell tolled, Master Li awoke to find his writing unfinished, yet the stele remained unchanged.\n\n---\n\n**Stele of the Perfected One’s Father**\n**Divine Path Stele of the Tang Dynasty’s Posthumously Appointed Cishi of Huanzhou, Lord Ye, with Preface**\n\nComposed by Li Yong of Jiangxia\nCalligraphed and inscribed by Han Zemu, Student of the Directorate of Education\n\nThe Lord’s personal name was Huiming;\nHis courtesy name, Dezhao, and he hailed from Nanyang.\nHis ancestry traced back to the Yellow Emperor, extending through King Wen of Zhou.\nWhen the state of Shen was enfeoffed upon Ziguo, and the fief of Ye granted to Zigao, the surname was thus established.\nIn later generations, some governed with the wisdom of Confucius, while others, enamored of dragons, attained the true Dao—each era bore men of renown.\n\nOf old, when the imperial mandate arose, the sagely radiance shone forth.\nWind and cloud followed in accord, divination and dreams resonated in harmony.\nAuspicious qi surged forth, and worthy ministers arrived in great numbers.\nWhat opens must have a beginning, and all things take form through reliance.\nThis is the natural order—thus was our Lord.\nDescending from the celestial府, he rode the currents of the Dao.\nTracing the footsteps of recluses, he called out to the hidden elders.\nHe built his hut by the streamside, roamed the steep valleys.\n\"With like-minded men, profit in constancy; in times of retreat, do not act.\"\nHe deeply cherished the virtue of wine and delved profoundly into the *Laozi*.\nHis words brought laughter and enlightenment, his principles inspired awe.\nHe guided others tirelessly, embracing all with empty openness and joy.\nMen of worth gathered at his gate, elders filled his lane.\nWhen the moon rose behind curtains and gentle winds stirred the groves,\nHe leaned on his staff and whistled in the valleys, sat on hides and played the qin upon the mountains.\nAt ease, he delighted in life; serene, he forgot old age.\nHe nurtured his nature, his lifespan neared that of immortals.\nHe followed the wanderings of Red Pine, embraced the guardianship of the Yellow and the Old.\nHe placed his body after all things, returned to the root, and attained suppleness.\nHe followed the Great Balance, upheld the Great Stability.\nColors and principles did not sway him; honor and disgrace did not disturb him.\nEver content, ever joyful—\nThe bearing of one of utmost virtue, unfathomable indeed.\nThus, masters and elders honored him with banners and rites; the state and clans were transformed by him.\nThe wise called him wise; the benevolent called him benevolent.\nThough he wore coarse hemp and lived by mulberry and hinge,\nAll avoided him on the road, showing reverence, holding the wind in awe, and breathing with caution.\n\nHis virtue was renowned in his household, and his descendants flourished.\nThen came our Lord Yue, who inherited his father’s virtue, extending blessings through his numinous birth and innate knowledge.\nHe learned and practiced diligently,\nPossessing the talent of a specialist and inheriting a grand legacy.\nHis talent and Dao matured together; upon reaching adulthood, he was one with the mysterious.\nHe sought the blessed courts of distant peaks, observed the esoteric arts of the reclusive masters.\nHis incantations shook thunder, his blades flashed like lightning.\nHe waded through the deep sea without getting wet, trod upon cold without feeling heat.\nHe commanded ten thousand ghosts, subdued a hundred spirits.\nHe opened the talismans of the nether bureaus, altered the records of the underworld.\nHe traced past events to their roots, sat and knew the future.\nThe blind and obscured could not hide their forms from him; mist and dew could not aggravate his ailments.\nHis marvelous deeds multiplied, his praiseworthy reputation spread daily.\nThus, the Great Lord rejoiced, and imperial summons repeatedly arrived.\nHe entered the inner chambers, consulted on omens and portents.\nEvery word he spoke came to pass; every matter he addressed was apt.\nFour eras passed, five dynasties succeeded.\nHe followed the wind to petition the Celestial Master, drew near the imperial throne with reverence.\nNeither monks nor laymen could surpass him; even high ministers deferred to his left.\nWhen the state performed rites to heaven and earth, or offered sacrifices to seas and mountains,\nThe Lord always presented offerings and jade, ensuring the rituals were pure and the sacrifices refined.\nFour-horse carriages filled the roads; prefectures and counties welcomed him thrice yearly.\nOf late, treacherous ministers hoarded calamity, petty men spread corruption.\nDaring to lead the rebellion, they kindled this dire crisis.\nThe heavenly path was not yet smooth; human affairs were about to begin.\nThe Lord then exhaustively expounded the esoteric and assisted the sagely plans.\nHe divined the stars and selected auspicious days, hastening to the offices of observation.\nAs a pillar of the state, he addressed the sovereign’s concerns first and last.\nHe aided in the extermination of the chief villain and the restoration of the imperial line.\nFor his extraordinary merits, his loyalty was extolled.\nHonors and rewards adorned his person; favor and posthumous titles illuminated his father.\nHad it not been for this father, how could the son have been instructed?\nHad it not been for this son, how could the father’s name have been exalted?\nThe pine and cypress have been planted, yet the stele remains unerected.\nSeeking to cherish him through the ages, his filial piety is thus preserved.\nRepeated requests were made to the court, yet the land by the river was deemed sufficient.\nFar and wide, talented men were sought; even this humble one was reluctantly summoned.\nLike Zhao Kuo discussing warfare, I lack the learning of old;\nLike Ban Gu writing history, I rely on family records.\nLooking upon this completed text, I prostrate myself in shame before the enduring stone.\n\nIts inscription reads:\nThe Perfected One, though reclusive, was not ashamed;\nThe Transcendent, though silent, shed his form.\nAlas, standing alone, he longed for the distant past.\nNearly attaining mysterious virtue, he ascended to behold the cinnabar classics.\nUnstained by his homeland, his radiance harmonized without striving.\nHe built his hut on the islet, gathered herbs to the left, and transmitted the qin.\nSlowly he whistled in the windy valley, leisurely he strolled in the moonlit forest.\nWhite clouds delighted his heart; clear springs cleansed his mind.\nWhat marvel did he not witness? What wonder did he not attend?\nAs the spirit drew near, emotions deepened with the land.\nThe age revered his methods; the imperial house had not yet honored him.\nThen came his illustrious son, who carried forth his virtuous legacy.\nLike Zuo Ci, he summoned things; like the man of Yue, he discerned colors.\nHe oversaw the schemes of ghosts, employed the power of spirits.\nFavor was bestowed by five sovereigns; his fame reached the eight directions.\nWhen the sun was often eclipsed and the state faced many hardships,\nRebellion spread, and loyal hearts burned with indignation.\nYet he foresaw all, aiding in the esoteric plans.\nAugust and divine, the Emperor’s decree was resplendent.\nSwiftly he took up arms, quelling the chaos.\nThe Emperor, mindful of his merits, granted him rank and land.\nNot for his own glory, but to honor his father.\nThe imperial domain bestowed crimson tassels; purple sashes were conferred.\nIn life, he achieved honor; in death, his loyalty and filial piety were fulfilled.\nRow upon row of pines and cypresses stir the wind with sorrow.\nThe tomb lacks a marker; his virtue remains unrecorded.\nAlas, the solemn dust! How profound the filial thoughts!\nWho will transmit this through the ages? This grand stele is erected.\n\nPosthumously appointed Huiming as Silver-and-Cyan Light of the Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, Cishi of Shezhou; his son, the Daoist Fashan, was granted the title Minister of Ceremonies and Duke of Yue.\n\nIn the seventh year of Kaiyuan, fifth cycle, the year Ding Si in the asterism Chunwei, the seventh day of the Jiachen cycle was established.\n\nDecree posthumously appointing [Leaf] as Prefect of Yuezhou:\nThe late Daoist master [Leaf], whose full titles and positions are recorded, embodied celestial purity and subtle profundity, his wondrous principles flowing with mysterious clarity. He encompassed esoteric essentials and elucidated divine talismans. Though his depths were as inscrutable as the silent and formless, rarely fathomed, his heart dwelled in the Peng orchard while his conduct harmonized with the five dynasties. He upheld the yellow cap without wavering, and though the purple sash was bestowed, it brought no vanity. Towering in solitary fragrance, he wandered alone with serene detachment. His transcendent qi severed worldly ties; his true wind left no dust. His golden bones rose externally; his pearl-like radiance shone within. Thus did his form align with the middle immortals, his name ascend among the highest virtue.\n\nIn moments of leisure from governance, We repeatedly inquired of the supreme Dao. He, with the methods of ordering the state, presented enlightened counsel time and again. His strategies bore subtle admonitions; his affairs brought great benefit. We lament that his illustrious voice has not yet faded, grieve that his bodily dissolution came so swiftly. Why should such a one be taken? The sudden loss of this worthy weighs heavily upon Us. It is fitting to extend posthumous honors, to adorn his resting place with due ceremony.\nThus, he is posthumously appointed Prefect of Yuezhou.\n\nImperially Composed Stele for the Perfected One:\nStele inscription and preface for the late Grand Master of the Golden Purple, Minister of Ceremonies and Duke of Yue, Abbot of Jinglong Abbey, posthumously appointed Prefect of Yuezhou, Master Leaf.\nThis stele was inscribed by the Emperor’s own hand; the title was written by the Crown Prince.\n\nWe have heard: Among the Three August Ones and Five Emperors, the most eminent was the veneration of Guangcheng. In the eras of Tang and Yu, the most eminent was the instruction of Yin Shou. Thus, with the Dao of the sage, one teaches the talent of the sage. After guarding it for seven days, then guarding it for nine days, one attains morning clarity and thereafter perceives the Dao alone. Entering water without getting wet, treading fire without feeling heat, whistling to summon wind and rain, lashing demons and spirits—without fixed method, one may thus advance all things. This is the numinous alone. The numinous is ever-changing; the Dao likewise pervades all. If one finds such a person, this is what is meant by \"establishing teaching through the numinous Dao.\"\n\nThe Master’s tabooed name was Fashan, his courtesy name Daoyuan. Since Zhu Liang received his fief, he was called the Lord of Ye. The district shared the name, and thus the surname was bestowed. Formerly, he was a man of Nanyang. His great-grandfather was Dao Xing, his grandfather Guo Zhong, his father Hui Shan, posthumously appointed Prefect of Shezhou. Those who adorned the gardens and fields upheld Our Dao as one thread; those who partook of ancient virtue could know it for a hundred generations. Thus, his name filled the cosmos while his person dwelled upon rivers and seas—now he is a man of Gu Kuo.\n\nIn the year Bingzi of the Daye era of the Sui, the Master was born. Six hundred forty-two cycles of sixty years passed until the year Gengshen of Our Kaiyuan era, when he dissolved his form and ascended upon the clouds. His spring and autumn numbered one hundred and seven. From Bingzi to Gengshen spanned one hundred and five years; accounting for intercalary months, the count of six hundred forty-two cycles of sixty years is thus confirmed, totaling one hundred and seven years.\n\nIn his birth, though advanced in years, his complexion remained that of a child. In his transformation, he shed his mortal form and his spirit became a silent immortal. He often accompanied Us in Our travels; the more We looked up to him, the loftier he seemed; the more We delved into him, the more steadfast he appeared. His hidden observations left no trace; his subtle allurements were unfathomable. If one spoke of aiding the state and assisting\n\nAt the outset, when the Master was but seven years old, he wandered by the river for nearly three years, and people believed he had drowned. Upon his return, when asked the reason, he replied: \"Three Azure Lads led me to rest in a towering hall of resplendent chambers. I swallowed divine elixirs and sipped cloud-borne nectar; the Supreme Lord oversaw me, and thus I remained.\" At fifteen, he was poisoned unto death, yet again he saw the Azure Lads of old, who said: \"Lord Mao of Tiantai has sent his flying seal.\" The seal pressed upon his abdomen, and at first he fell into suffocating darkness. After a long while, clarity returned. The Master’s numinous responsiveness and spiritual communion were extraordinary indeed.\n\nThereupon, he staff in hand, roamed through famous mountains, seeking Lord Mao from afar until he encountered him. His skeletal frame rose like a peak, his pupils were square, his bearing as pristine as ice and snow, and he smiled faintly, saying: \"Have you come? Your name is already inscribed in the register of immortals. You have met with demonic trials, and thus I rescued you to spare you. You should set your mind on aiding others and assisting the teachings, without hastening toward departure or return.\" Thereafter, he received from Zhao Yuanyang of Qingcheng the arts of *dunjia* and *buxuan*; from Wei Shanjun of Songgao, he transmitted the Way of the Eight Histories and Cloud-Striding. He reposed on Luofu and Kuocang, journeyed to and fro between Penglai and Fangzhang. Numinous charts and secret formulas, immortal talismans and true scriptures, veritable records and life contracts—all were transmitted through mysterious resonance and empty revelation. With a single glance, eighteen thousand spirits appeared; by swallowing the embryonic breath, one thousand two hundred cycles were sustained. At times, he swam hidden in water palaces; at others, he strode flying through fire chambers. Sometimes he split open his abdomen to wash his intestines, recovering without medicine; sometimes he gouged out his eyes to remove their membranes, casting talismans to restore them. At times, he concocted deadly poisons and consumed them with indifference; at others, he summoned ghostly beings, who arrived at his command. He rebuked drought demons, and the host of spirits fled like servants. Thus, he was renowned throughout the land, his transformations myriad.\n\nThe former court favored him, granting audience thrice in a single day. While We resided in the princely manor, We repeatedly heard the essentials of the Dao. Upon ascending to the county of Linyu, We cherished his forthright counsel. When treacherous ministers harbored schemes and rebels usurped, he never failed to forewarn Us, offering profound and timely aid. Therefore, We specially bestowed upon him the purple sash and enfeoffed him as Grand Duke. Yet he remained steadfast in the Yellow Center, declining the honors of cap and carriage. Truly, his virtue was vast in its bestowal, his Dao exalted in its radiance.\n\nWhen he came, there was no boasting—it was the Master’s time; when he departed, there was no resentment—it was the Master’s compliance. In the year of *Chunwei*, the month of *Chunhuo*, if he transformed and departed in the *Gengshen* year, it would align with the actual year. Yet as the *Chen* month of *Chunshou* appears in earlier and later stele records with discrepancies, We do not wish to alter it lightly. At that time, his treasures... returning to truth, suspended and unbound.\n\nOn the first day of the month, he was posthumously enfeoffed as Governor of Yuezhou. In the *Yu* month, he returned to be interred in the Kuocang Mountains. He was exempted from court regalia, in accordance with his long-held aspiration.\n\nThe Master possessed an extraordinary nature, his bearing marked by singular integrity. His spirit shone beyond his form, his bones refined, his appearance noble. Thus, Master Wan addressed him, saying: \"Your writings fulfill the criteria for transcendence; soon you shall ascend to the Celestial Palace. I shall follow you to become your peer.\" Truly, as the *Book of Changes* states: \"The noble one may emerge or remain in reclusion—yet those who emerge know not the leisure of mountains and forests, while those who remain know not the honors of cap and carriage.\" Though the Dao is one and the responses harmonious, the paths differ and cannot be pursued simultaneously. The Master nurtured his spirit in the Great Harmony, contemplating the wondrous Mystery and the Dark Womb—this was the noble one’s fulfillment in reclusion. The golden seal was truly precious, the purple sash soon to arrive—this was the noble one’s fulfillment in emergence. Had his Dao not attained vastness and greatness, had his virtue not aligned with the numinous, who could have achieved such a state? Thus, in service to the royal house, he received favor through five generations; in Our time, those who transmitted the Dao numbered several—his status as a patriarchal master was beyond question.\n\nThose who compose texts record the truth; those who extol virtue esteem its teachings. The Master knew Us; how could We not recount him? Truly, his deeds were without shame, and his writings may be examined as evidence.\n\n**Inscription:**\nSudden and vigorous, none fail to emerge from it.\nSerene and pure, none fail to enter it.\nThe source of all flourishing,\nThe spring of all transformations.\nIn this, contemplate the wondrous—\nTruly, he ranks among the Immortals.\nWhat are the Immortals?\nThey dissolve transformation and reverse aging.\nWhat is the wondrous?\nHow could it rely on the Ultimate Dao?\nPervading the hidden and aiding the obscure,\nHis spirit transforms and his numen creates.\nHe eradicated pernicious shrines and malevolent influences,\nNo concealment escaped his scrutiny.\nHis poems countered rebellion and aided compliance,\nHis achievements assisted the times.\nConcealing the past and discerning the subtle,\nHis work aligned with the divine.\nHonors were bestowed in increasing measure,\nYet he remained untainted by future deceit.\nHe regarded worldly ties as if discarding them,\nLeaving Us in wistful reflection.\nGreat possession, primal auspiciousness—\nThe Yellow Center penetrates principle.\nSilently, the transcendent shed his mortal form,\nHis mystery boundless and eternal.\nLike the flight seen in Yexian,\nLike the crane alighting on the distant sea.\nThe numinous wind flourishes in its majesty,\nThriving through a thousand ages.\n\nIn the twenty-seventh year of the *Kaiyuan* era, the year *Jimao*, on the twenty-sixth day of the second month (the first day being *Jiwei*), he departed by riding transformation. Though he has gone, his old affections remain undiminished; thus, his deeds are recorded. By the shores of the immortal mountains and seas, the stele endures. *\"Departed by riding transformation\"*—these twenty-four characters appear in the old text and are retained here without deletion.\n\n**Memorial of Disciple Ding Zhengguan and Others, Expressing Gratitude for the Bestowal of the Stele Inscription for the Perfected One Xie Ci:**\nThe Daoist of the *Suming* Abbey within the *Jie* era, Yin Xi, announced the imperial edict issued within the *Jie* era, bestowing it upon the Master of Our Sect. We, kneeling to receive the celestial decree, gaze upon the imperial brush. Overwhelmed with awe and joy, we are filled with both celebration and sorrow. Though unworthy, we are among his disciples; our gratitude and shame are boundless. Respectfully, we record and present this memorial in gratitude. Memorial submitted on the twenty-third day of the fourth month in the twenty-seventh year of the *Kaiyuan* era by the Daoist Ding Zhengguan of the *Jinglong* Abbey and others.\n\n**Edict Conferring the Title of Master of Emptiness and Simplicity:**\nIn the *Jie* era, the Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, Minister of Rites, Duke of Yue, and Celestial Master for Protecting the State and Numinous Perfection, Ye [Mou]:\nThose who cultivate the Dao act without seeking fame, and others cannot name them—this is why the perfected abandon names. Yet when promoting goodness and reproving evil, establishing teachings for posterity, names serve as outward signs. Even those who govern the realm cannot dispense with them. Having studied the Dao and attained the method, he extricated himself from the mire of defilement. Now, centuries later, his sword and sandals remain as if alive, still responding to the world and the people. Though he did not seek the ranks of prayer and supplication, he naturally attained them. We merely adjust his title to comfort the people of the region. Let him be specially enfeoffed as *Master of Emptiness and Simplicity*. The twenty-first day of the first month in the sixth year of the *Zhenghe* era.\n\n**Edict Conferring the Title of Perfected One of Numinous Emptiness and Simplicity:**\nIn the *Jie* era, We embody the wondrous Dao to govern Ourself and propagate the pure wind to nurture the world. Whenever We recall the titles of lofty perfected ones, We are moved by the footsteps of those who came before. The Perfected One of Emptiness and Simplicity, Ye Fashan, was a transcendent minister of the Great Ultimate and a feathered guest of Kuocang. He swept away demonic evil and extinguished calamities, subdued specters and startled demons into flight. Thus, during the *Kaiyuan* era, he repeatedly manifested traces of a transformed being, his depths unfathomable, all arising naturally. Though the name *Emptiness and Simplicity* is but a provisional designation, the previous edicts of governance and peace already reflect our reverence. How could We forget to further honor *Numinous Emptiness* to manifest his sublime mystery? Let him be specially enfeoffed as *Perfected One of Numinous Emptiness and Simplicity*. The twenty-fifth day of the sixth month in the second year of the *Xuanhe* era.\n\n**The Transmission of the Tang Perfected One Ye Concludes.**",

      "translated_text": "**The Transmission of Tang Dynasty Perfected Person Ye**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Transmission of Tang Dynasty Perfected Person Ye* (also titled *The Transmission of Tang Dynasty Chief Minister of State Ceremonies, Duke of Yue, Perfected Person Lingxu Jiansu*)\n\nOne scroll. Author unknown. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Genealogical Records* Category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *The Transmission of Tang Dynasty Perfected Person Ye***\n\nThe Daoist school takes clarity, stillness, and emptiness as its foundation; the Immortal school takes guiding and refining as its method. The First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han once sought immortals, yet having sought without success, they declared: \"How could immortals exist in the world? It is all delusion and falsehood.\"\n\nAlas! The transformations of the numinous are boundless, the subtle and formless beyond fathoming. To cast aside the trappings of fame and rank is to tread the mire of official caps and carriages. How could such sovereigns, ensnared by excessive desires, ever summon them?\n\nWhen I served as prefect of Kuocang, my cousin, Gentleman Zhang, was a master of the Daoist lineage and a true feathered adept. One day, he visited me and presented *The Transmission of Perfected Master Ye*. Upon reading it, I saw how he summoned divine beings and encountered immortal visitors—all through a lifetime of dedicated refinement and cultivation. His immortal bearing and Daoist essence had long resonated with the numinous, enabling him to move and harmonize with them so effortlessly. This was also because he was filial to his parents, loyal to his sovereign, and thus able to stir heaven and earth, to move ghosts and spirits. His rank as a high minister allowed him to command wind and ride thunder, to receive the honor of heaven’s nobility—how could mere mortal titles ever confine him?\n\nNow, his immortal transformation has endured for nearly a thousand years. When the people pray for clear skies or beseech rain, his blessings extend to all living beings. His responses are as swift as an echo, and so he rightfully receives offerings and sacrifices. The fragrant incense burns endlessly, and in a single day, his legacy shall endure for ten thousand generations without end.\n\nWritten in the spring of the *gengzi* year of the Chunyou era by Ma Guangzu of Yuzhai.\n\n---\n\n**The Transmission of Perfected Person Lingxu Jiansu, Duke of Yue, Chief Minister of State Ceremonies of the Tang Dynasty**\n\nThe Perfected Person’s surname was Ye. His given name was Fas han, courtesy name Daoyuan, and alternate name Taisu. He was originally from Nanyang. Since the time of Duke Shen of Ye, his lineage descended from the Liang clan. During the late Han, under Emperors Huan and Ling, his family fled to the lands east of the Yangtze. His earliest ancestor, Jian, sought fine mountains and rivers and found them in Nanxiang of Kuaiji, where he concealed himself between the *mao* and *you* directions and settled in Songyang.\n\nHis great-grandfather, Qianyu, was renowned for his virtue and power. His grandfather, Daoxing, upheld the family’s legacy without fail. His father, Guozhong, first established the grand lineage. His father, Huiming, studied poetry and ritual as a Confucian scholar but never pursued glory or favor. He wandered through mountains and forests, resting his head on stones and rinsing his mouth with streams. He sang as he carried firewood and often wove grass into shelters. He foresaw the unseen, saying, \"I shall have a son.\"\n\nHis wife, née Liu, once dreamed during her daytime rest that a shooting star entered her mouth, which she swallowed, and soon after conceived. After fifteen months, in the year *kundun*, during the month of *huangzhong*, the Perfected Person was born. The sky was free of floating clouds, and the four seasons were bright and clear. An extraordinary fragrance filled the room, and divine radiance illuminated the hall.",

      "translated_text": "Amidst lingering rosy clouds, black cranes descended from above. While the Perfected Person yet dwelt in the womb, his voice was heard beyond. At birth, he was keen and bright; in childhood, precocious and discerning. By the age of seven, his bearing was gentle and refined, his countenance ancient and mature. His father gazed upon him and said, \"Though you are young and diligent now, in old age you shall attain noble grace.\"\n\nThereupon, he crossed the river and wandered for three years without returning, so that his family believed him drowned. When he came back and was asked the reason, he replied, \"Two azure youths led me away, gave me cloud-essence to drink, and detained me for some time.\"\n\nAt the age of ten, a physiognomist declared, \"With your sun-browed, moon-deep features, your towering shoulders and constricted lower frame, you shall one day become the teacher of emperors.\" Upon reaching twenty, he stood nine feet tall, his forehead marked with two *wu* characters. His nature was pure and unsullied; from childhood, he abstained from meat and dwelt alone in secluded chambers. Fond of ancient learning, at eleven he recited the *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents*, and at twelve studied rites and music. He delved deeply into the *Zhouyi*, and took profound delight in the works of Laozi and Zhuangzi. The *He-Luo* charts and apocrypha he examined in full. His aspiration was to cultivate the Dao, dwelling in forests and springs.\n\nWith his father, he retired to Maoshan, where they lived by gathering firewood and wild plants. Seeking auspicious sites, he observed the stars and monitored the *qi*. He ascended lofty peaks and descended into deep ravines, tracing the sources of rivers and traversing perilous paths. Already, he commanded spirit attendants: a massive boulder blocked the path before his dwelling, but when he cast a talisman, the stone rose and flew away in an instant, landing in the southeast of the mountain. All who witnessed this were astonished. To this day, a stone hollow remains on Maoshan.\n\nOften he sought hidden places and visited recluses, discovering the sacred site of Lingxu. There lay the stream where Ou Ye forged his swords. By Ou Brook stood the tomb of a divine maiden; nearby were Stone Gate Ridge and the Immortal’s Drag-Sandal Ridge. The mountain’s terrain encompassed the Grotto-Heaven of Kuocang, the Divine Capital, stretching onward to Tiantai and Siming. Not far distant lay the Red Pine Grotto of Changshan in Jinhua, where Huang Chuping had commanded the stone sheep. Between them flowed the White Horse Mountain’s waterfall, while the sheer cliffs of Green Brook—anciently called Immortal’s Abode—were lush with verdant forests and springs. Here the Perfected Person took refuge.\n\nThough his family was poor, he once said, \"I live in this world, yet my work remains unfinished. With aged parents at home, how shall I provide for them?\" So he hired himself out to till the fields, laboring without rest day after day, often shaded by a canopy of purple clouds. When others tried to claim the shaded spot, the clouds followed him. Once, a fisherman swept him into the mud with his net, yet he neither spoke nor showed anger. When a herdsman’s horse trampled his crops, he bore no grudge; when a cowherd stole his metal tools, he remained unperturbed.\n\nAfter his parents’ passing, he sought a burial site near Ou Brook. There, a white deer lay in the snow at the mountain’s foot; as he approached, the deer leapt away, leaving its resting place warm, with a white mist stretching unbroken across the heights and depths. The Perfected Person marveled at this and stood for a moment, surveying the mountain. Its layered ridges and overlapping hills embraced the four cardinal directions, while the terrain to the left and right, before and behind, rose and fell in perfect accord, its form and configuration fully realized.",

      "translated_text": "He sighed and said, \"This place may serve as a burial site.\" Thereupon, he buried them there.\n\nThe Perfected Person said, \"Without encountering a renowned master, how can one transcend the world?\" At the time, he was but thirteen years of age. He journeyed from Mount Guacang into Tiantai, Siming, Jinhua, and Kuaiji, crossing the rivers and lakes of Zhejiang. Northward, he entered Tianzhu, Tianmu, Gusu, Dongting, Gouqu, Mount Heng, and Mount Huo. Southward, he traveled along the Jian River, ascended Red City, and reached Luofu, among other places. Wherever there were famous mountains and sacred sites, south of the Jiang and Han rivers, he traversed them all.\n\nHe sought out Master Wan of Yuzhang to learn the arts of elixir-refining, grain avoidance, guiding and pulling, and embryonic breathing. Yet he practiced only bear-hanging and bird-stretching, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, eating pine seeds and tree bark, remaining indifferent to worldly glory. At fifteen, he was poisoned nearly to death. Then he saw a blue youth who said, \"The immortals of Gouqu and Lord Mao of Tiantai shall rescue you with a flying seal.\" No sooner had the words been spoken than the seal arrived, imprinting his abdomen. After a long while, he felt suddenly clear and unburdened.\n\nHe traveled far to meet Lord Mao. Upon their encounter, his skeletal frame rose nobly, and his pupils became square. Smiling faintly, Lord Mao said, \"You have come. Your name is already recorded in the registers of immortality, and you have encountered demonic trials. Thus, I rescued you to spare you harm. You should set your mind on aiding others and assisting the Daoist teachings.\"\n\nThereafter, on Mount Qingcheng, he received from Zhao Yuanyang the arts of *dunjia* and *buxuan*. From Wei Shanjun of Songgao, he learned the Way of the Eight Histories and Cloud Steeds. Later, he entered Mount Meng to seek hidden arts. On the mountain path, he encountered a feathered scholar who asked, \"Where are you bound?\"\n\nThe Perfected Person replied, \"I seek a master to study the Dao.\"\n\nThe feathered scholar said, \"I, too, study the Dao. What fortune to meet you here! I must briefly depart for another place. I have a small bundle of plain garments—would you guard it for me?\"\n\nThe Perfected Person said, \"Very well.\"\n\nThe feathered scholar then departed. After several days, he returned and said, \"You are truly a man of integrity. I wish to repay you with a scroll of immortal scriptures and a divine sword.\" He opened the bundle and bestowed them upon him.\n\nThe feathered scholar took his leave, saying, \"Simply hold these and practice accordingly. In time, visions will gradually appear, and you will foreknow good and evil. You must also compound the divine elixir, set up the altar, and raise the sacred turtle. After several years of devoted practice and spiritual communion, on the night of the first *jia* day of the tenth month, he burned incense and made his vows. Suddenly, he heard the sounds of bells, chimes, flutes, strings, and panpipes resonating in the air.\n\nRising to look, he saw in an instant that the room was filled with riders. Among them were three divine beings, each over eight feet tall, with extraordinary countenances. They wore cloud-brocade robes and *tongtian* crowns. The Perfected Person prostrated himself and reverently entreated them.\n\nOne of the divine beings said, \"Simply resume your seat and do not fear. The Most High has sent us to inform you that you are destined to attain the Dao. In a former life, you were the Left Palace Immortal Recorder of the Purple Tenuity of the Great Ultimate, charged with recording the names of all immortals and those who attained the Dao under heaven, tallying their years and merits, and submitting reports thrice monthly. Due to a lapse in vigilance, you once wandered the Eight Wastes during a day of leisure. For this, you were sent down to the mortal world to further cultivate merit and accumulate virtue. When your deeds are complete, you shall reclaim your immortal rank.\n\nNow, you practice the rites of the Three-Five Alliance and the Orthodox Unity, slaying demons and malevolent spirits, rescuing those afflicted by drought, bestowing alms upon the poor, and administering justice on behalf of Heaven. Let hidden virtue be your foremost concern; no additional offerings or petitions are required. I have secret methods to transmit to you, but you must purify yourself for three days and ensure no worldly person knows of this. Receive my oral instructions—do not commit them to writing, lest they fall into unworthy hands. To lightly divulge the decrees of the Emperor would implicate seven generations of your ancestors, barring their ascent to the heavens.\"\n\nThereupon, the divine being bestowed upon him talismans, a sword, seals, and stamps.\n\nAnother divine being said, \"Now that you have retired from true rank and descended to the mortal world, you should broadly establish merit and virtue. Receive further the talismanic charts of the Five Peaks, the Celestial August Script, the Three-One Perfected Scripture, the Yellow Court and Purple Writ, the Eight Effulgences and Plain Writ, and the secret and wondrous arts of *bunie* and *chengji*. All the Upper Clarity, Upper Dharma, and Upper Perfection of the Three Caverns must be diligently cultivated, morning and evening without fail. Hold fast to the *Five Thousand Character Scripture*, govern the human Dao, and discern the principles of Heaven and Earth. Do not lightly divulge these teachings, and the Dao shall naturally be accomplished.\"\n\nYet another divine being said, \"The subtle wonders of the Supreme Dao cannot be expressed in words. You must guard the One and cast aside arrogance and excess. Regularly sound the bells and drums, harmonize the Three Principles and Passes, practice guiding and pulling, exhale the old and inhale the new, and ingest both inner and outer elixirs. Constantly embrace and store the sun and moon, open and close the gates, and cultivate the Most High at dawn. Then shall the Vermilion Radiance subtly illuminate you, and the Essenceless and White Prime shall come to guard you. When the Yellow and Lao present their records and your merit is complete, you shall surely ascend. You have received these words—practice without weariness. When the appointed time draws near, we shall meet again on the northern peak of the Xu family’s Jingyang Lord’s estate.\"\n\nThe Perfected Person prostrated himself and gave thanks, saying, \"My conduct is slight and my virtue meager. I did not comprehend the celestial truth, yet you have deigned to descend in your numinous chariot—this is beyond my expectations. I reverently accept your teachings and shall devote myself to their practice.\"\n\nHe bowed twice and took his leave. The divine beings then soared into the sky and departed.\n\nFrom then on, he practiced hidden virtue in secret, delivering the living and the dead. When he healed illnesses in Kuaiji, he repeatedly revived the dead.",

      "translated_text": "Again in Yangzhou, he opened the abdomen of the Prefect’s Lady with his sword, extracting the ailment to show the onlookers—whereupon the Lady’s illness immediately abated as before. Whenever he split open bowels or exchanged stomachs, or cut open bellies to reshape forms, there was never any harm done, nor any pain suffered. He would pry out an eye, wash the pupil, and place it upon paper; removing the membrane and cataracts, he would then restore it to its socket—without the slightest disturbance, and the eye would see as clearly as before. If people pressed money upon him, he would beg it for the poor and sick. Wherever mad spirits or licentious sacrifices wrought calamity, wherever his steps fell, he would execute them all. His name spread far and near, and all came to know of him.\n\nSummons arrived time and again; he repeatedly declined, refusing to comply, but was reluctantly compelled to attend the imperial court. When Emperor Gaozong saw him, he did not require him to observe the rites of a subject. Serene and still, he showed no sign of life, save for faint breathing. The Emperor asked, “Are you unwell?” He replied, “My illness lies in the marketplace and court; my cure lies in the mountains and forests. I beg to withdraw and live in seclusion.” The Emperor said, “This is but a reclusive man.” He issued an edict appointing him Supreme Minister, but the Perfected Person firmly declined and did not bow in acceptance. He said, “I wish to leave the household life. I beg to be made a Daoist priest.” The Emperor then assented, ordaining him at Jinglong Abbey. He often remained in the inner palace, where the Emperor questioned him on the Dao and its methods, plumbing their deepest mysteries. Matters of fortune and misfortune, good and ill—he foresaw them all, and his words never missed their mark.\n\nWhen Hei He rebelled, the sovereign was filled with dread, at a loss for what to do. He asked the Perfected Person, “How may this be averted and remedied?” The reply came: “This petty bandit is no cause for concern.” Thereupon, with talismanic arts, he summoned tens of thousands of celestial soldiers, who descended veiled in darkness, their armor and blades clashing as they routed the rebels in flight. The Emperor said, “In defending the altars of state, you have rendered great service.” He repeatedly bestowed gifts of favor, but the Perfected Person declined them all, saying, “This is the work of the Dao and the divine; what part have I in it?”\n\nAt that time, the daughter of a Palace Secretary was afflicted by a fox spirit, driven to madness and raving, speaking in ghostly tongues and uttering eerie prophecies.

Suddenly, an epidemic spread, and many of those accompanying the imperial procession fell ill and died. The Emperor ordered the Perfected Person to treat the affliction. With a single incantation and talisman, the epidemic vanished, and those on the verge of death all revived.

He then demanded of the musicians in the pit, \"Why do you not play?\" They reported, \"We see serpents in the four directions, each as thick as a pillar, opening their mouths to bite us. Terrified, we dare not move.\"\n\nAt that time, a drought occurred, and the Emperor commanded the Perfected Person to pray for rain at the river. The Master said, \"Bring your finest rain garments and ceremonial canopies, and follow me.\" The people did not believe him. Yet as soon as the prayers concluded, rain fell like mist, soaking the clothes and caps of men and horses alike.\n\nOne day, he urged the Emperor to temporarily leave his sleeping quarters to avoid disaster. Initially skeptical, the Emperor relented only after the Perfected Person insisted. Once he had moved, wind, rain, thunder, and lightning struck the former sleeping quarters, shattering the imperial tent. The Emperor was deeply shaken. Many other verified events are too numerous to record.\n\nThough the Perfected Person moved within the vermilion gates, aiding the times and assisting the state, he concealed his traces, blending with the world while his heart remained set on the Daoist path. Yearning for transcendence, he sought to return to the mountains. The Emperor finally granted his request.\n\nHe traveled to Mount Mao, Gusu, Dongting, Tianmu, Tiantai, and Kuocang, among other places. On Mount Mao, he cultivated the Dao and refined elixirs, never failing in his morning audiences. On the first day of the fifth month, an old man came to his door, weeping and begging for help. The Perfected Person invited him in and asked what troubled him.\n\nThe old man said, \"I am a dragon of the Eastern Sea. The Celestial Thearch has appointed me to guard the treasures of the Eight Seas, rotating the duty every thousand years. Those without fault ascend to the ranks of immortals. I have served for nine hundred and seventy years, and my term is nearly complete. A Brahmin sorcerer has been practicing his illusions by the sea, chanting spells day and night for twenty years. His magic is about to take effect: the sea will rise like clouds to the heavens. On the fifth day of the fifth month, the sea will dry up, and the treasure that governs the seas and stabilizes the heavens will be seized by the sorcerer. I beg for your aid.\"\n\nThe Perfected Person agreed. At noon on the fifth day, he sent forth a flying talisman from his elixir cauldron, and the sea returned to its former state. The Brahmin sorcerer, ashamed and sighing, threw himself into the sea and died. The next day, the old man and his kin brought rare treasures to express their gratitude, but the Perfected Person declined them all. He then said, \"This mountain is far from water. If I could have a spring, it would be a great kindness.\"\n\nThat very day, as wind and rain passed, a clear spring emerged beside the mountain lodge, flowing from a stone channel. Even in drought, it never ran dry. Today, it is called the Celestial Master’s Channel. In the regions beneath Siming and east of Tiantai, wherever the Perfected Person resided, altars were established and wells dug.\n\nAt the summit of Maoshan, he first built a mountain retreat, which was later bestowed the plaque *Tongtian Abbey*. In the third year of the *Dazhong Xiangfu* era, it was renamed *Shouchang Abbey*. To the northwest of the abbey stood the Elixir-Refining Well, and at the mountain’s base, a sacred spring. Near the spring was the Ritual Kitchen, where scholars and commoners came to pray.\n\nIn the first year of the *Zhiping* era, it was renamed *Shousheng Abbey*, and later changed to *Guangfu Abbey*. Once, the Perfected Person traveled to Qingxi during the scorching summer. With fellow Daoists, he wandered along the river islets. Suddenly, he submerged into the water and did not resurface for seven days. His companions, alarmed, believed he had been devoured by a flood dragon. They returned to inform his household and disciples, both Daoist and lay, who all searched along the riverbank.\n\nAfter seven days, he unexpectedly emerged from the very spot where he had entered. He said, \"You must have been frightened. I briefly visited Penglai with the River Earl, where several immortals were feasting. Fearing you would worry, I hastened back—just as you see.\" He then entered Tiantai to seek Master Alchemist Sima, visiting the immortal gardens of undying bliss.\n\nPassing through Tongwu and Lingxu, he said to Master Alchemist Sima, \"Beneath the towering pines, upon the lush grasses—today, this is our resting place.\" Ascending Huading Peak to gaze at the sea, he remarked, \"Penglai is not far from here. You and I shall return there someday.\" Master Alchemist Sima carried his zither, while the Perfected Person wielded his sword. Crossing the stone bridge and facing the ten-thousand-*ren* abyss of Qingxi, they treaded perilous paths, leaning against the jade-green cliffs—what had they to fear?\n\nIn the *xinchou* year, Empress Wu Zetian summoned the Perfected Person to cast dragon tablets and gather herbs, praying at famous mountains and great rivers. His carriage flew like the wind, and his retinue stretched endlessly. Later, during the reign of Emperor Zhongzong, Wu Sansi still held power, and the court was rife with slander. The Perfected Person repeatedly remonstrated, but his words displeased the Emperor, and he was exiled to the lands beyond the ridges. His disciples grew anxious, but the Perfected Person said, \"Fortune and misfortune come in their time. This is simply how it must be.\"\n\nHe traveled to Mount Heng, then to Lianzhou, still hundreds of *li* from Guangzhou, where the land route was impassable and a boat was required. Wishing to gather herbs in Guangzhou, he first sent his disciples ahead by boat. Daoists at the Yitang Abbey heard of his arrival and rushed to inform Prefect Hu Yuanli, who, along with Daoists, monks, nuns, and local officials, went to the riverbank to welcome him.\n\nSoon after, they saw the Perfected Person riding a white horse across the water. Upon reaching the shore, they exchanged greetings and escorted him to Longxing Abbey.",

      "translated_text": "The Prefect, Vice-Prefect, Chief Clerk, and common folk all received the Daoist teachings. Many donated gardens, groves, fields, and residences, but the Perfected Person accepted nothing, returning all to the abbey’s permanent endowment.\n\nLater, an imperial decree arrived, ordering his transfer to Hongzhou, where he resided at Zonghua Abbey. Taking his disciples, he entered the Western Mountains to the abode of Master Hongya, where he dwelled for three years, practicing the Hidden Methods of Supreme Clarity.\n\nIn the fourth year of Jinglong (recorded in the annals as the second year of Jingyun), the year *xinhai*, on the sixth night of the third month, a disciple dreamed of an immortal leading a crane, who asked, “Who are you?” The immortal replied, “I am a man of this time and shall not reveal my name.” Pointing to the disciple, he said, “You are fortunate to have the Left Palace Immortal Minister as your master. The Emperor will soon summon him, and word will come.” The crane led by the immortal circled and danced gracefully. Upon waking, the disciple reported this to the Perfected Person, who said, “You must have dreamed—this is an auspicious sign, and I already know its meaning.”\n\nAt noon on the ninth day, auspicious clouds, celestial music, and a fragrant aroma filled the air, drifting into the chamber. The disciples recognized the scene from the dream. The immortal addressed the Perfected Person: “Do you recognize me?” He replied, “I think of your true form day and night, as if parched with thirst. In my waking and dreaming, I always attend you—how could I not know you?” He bowed twice in reverence. The immortal said, “Your accumulated merit is nearly complete, but you must refine yourself further. When the Dao is lofty, demonic trials arise—you must be cautious. The Most High has commanded me to deliver the Golden Essence Elixir of Transformed Bones to you. The time is not yet ripe, so do not consume it; keep it hidden.”\n\nThe immortal continued, “By the eighth month, you will enter the capital to assist the reigning Emperor and the future *Kaishen Shenwu Emperor*, transmitting the Daoist teachings and eliminating the chief villain. The nation’s fortunes are precarious, but the dragon’s ascent is imminent. You must aid the state, pacify the sacred mountains and rivers, and perform the *Toulong* Offering—this duty falls to you, as Heaven protects you. Though you will receive worldly honors and ranks, even a fiefdom, your inner position will manifest outwardly, like a shadow following form. In the year of the Quail’s Tail, the month of the Quail’s Fire, at noon on the third day, the Western Peak Attendant Minister will restore you to the position of Left Palace Immortal Minister of the Purple Tenuity in the Supreme Ultimate.”\n\nThe Perfected Person bowed and replied, “I am of base and foolish nature, undeserving of such favor. If I fail in this later duty, it would be like an ant trying to move a mountain—I would be unworthy. How could I repay such grace, even if I ground my bones to dust?” He bowed twice more and took his leave.\n\nIn the eighth month, an edict arrived: “Daoist Master Ye is to enter the capital. If he has disciples, they may accompany him.” The Perfected Person, having received the decree, traveled by post to the capital. After his audience, he remained often in the inner court. At the time, the future Emperor Xuanzong was in his princely residence, and the Perfected Person stayed with him. They conducted rites at the Dragon Manifestation Altar, and all prayers were answered—snow accumulated a foot deep, and requests for rain or frost were fulfilled. Once, on Mount Lu, as he ascended the altar, water gushed from the earth at its corners, sweet and clear, while cranes and herbs danced. At the residence of Master Xu, during a rite, two yellow dragons emerged from a well.\n\nThe Perfected Person aided Xuanzong in Mingzhou, where he foresaw the rebellion of the Wei clan and had already reported the *Xiantian* prophecy, all of which proved true. Xuanzong once asked him about essential matters, and he replied in secret, “I once met an immortal who spoke of the *Kaiyuan* imperial title.” He knew in advance of all conspirators. When Xuanzong ascended the throne, he changed the era name to *Kaiyuan* and styled himself the *Shenwu Emperor*. The Perfected Person remained by his side, advising on all matters, secretly offering profound counsel, eliminating harm, and vanquishing villains, his mysterious merit extending far and wide.\n\nThe Chancellor Yao Chong’s daughter had died, and his grief was profound. The Perfected Person cast a talisman, reviving her. The wife of Magistrate Zhang had died and transformed into a revenant, reuniting with her husband. The Perfected Person recognized this and said, “This is the affliction of corpse enchantment. If not swiftly removed, Magistrate Zhang will die.” He cast a talisman, and the revenant dissolved into black qi.\n\nAt the Qiantang River, a giant clam drowned boats and troubled travelers. The chief of Qingsha Town, Shen Yu, personally came to welcome the Perfected Person, who thus went there. When the tide arrived, he subdued the clam with an iron talisman and cinnabar script, and the menace ceased to this day. He also inscribed the characters *Daojing* (“Daoist Serenity”) on a cliff with his sword, each character spanning over three *zhang*. The original inscriptions remain, at the mountain now called the Gate of the Three Teachings.\n\nXuanzong moved his retinue to the Shangyang Palace to view lanterns. The imperial artisans, led by Mao Yi, constructed over thirty pavilions adorned with gold, kingfisher feathers, pearls, and jade, towering over a hundred *zhang*. A gentle breeze made them chime harmoniously, and lanterns shaped like dragons and phoenixes seemed beyond mortal craft. Xuanzong was delighted and summoned the Perfected Person to view them below. The Perfected Person said, “The splendor of these lanterns is unmatched, yet the lanterns of the Western Capital tonight are nearly as grand. However, such extravagance is of no benefit to the state.”\n\nThe Emperor, surprised by his words, wished to test his immortal arts and said, “I would like to go there now. Is that possible?” The Perfected Person replied, “It is easy, but for Your Majesty to travel far to view lanterns is not fitting.” The Emperor insisted. The Perfected Person asked him to close his eyes, and in an instant, they ascended. When they arrived, the Perfected Person used his *ruyi* scepter to toast the Emperor. As they prepared to return, he again asked the Emperor to close his eyes, and in a moment, they were back beneath the pavilion, where the music and dance had not yet ended. Later, the Emperor sent a eunuch on an errand to the Western Capital, instructing him to retrieve the *ruyi* scepter as proof—it was not a lie.\n\nOn the night of the full moon in the eighth month, he accompanied the Emperor to the Lunar Palace, where they listened to celestial music. When asked the name of the melody, he replied, “*Ziyun* (Purple Cloud).” The Emperor, skilled in music, memorized the tune and later composed it in the Music Bureau, renaming it “*Nishang Yuyi* (Rainbow Skirts and Feathered Robes).”",

Foreseeing omens before they arise, he has expressed his loyal devotion. It is fitting to bestow these honors in recognition of his meritorious deeds. Thus, let his wishes be fulfilled, and let him don the garb of the Perfected.”*\n\nThe edict conferred upon him the titles of *Jinzi Guanglu Daifu*, *Honglu Qing*, Duke of Yue, and Abbot of Jinglong Abbey. Though the Perfected Person declined, his refusal was not accepted. He then requested that the honors be posthumously bestowed upon his late father and offered his ancestral home at the gate of Kuocang Mountain.

      "translated_text": "The villagers marveled at his wondrous words, unable to fathom their origin. In the eighth year of the Kaiyuan era, the geng-yin year, in the fifth lunar month, the Perfected One had already reached the age of one hundred and seven. At the Jinglong Abbey in the Western Capital, he feigned illness and secretly ingested the divine elixir. Celestial immortals came and went; a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders passed day and night without cease. His disciples, princely kin, imperial envoys, and court officials came and went unnoticed. Only his disciples Jun Qing and Lu Qiwu witnessed the mystery in secret, saying nothing.\n\nOn the third day of the sixth lunar month, at the hour of noon on the jiashen day, the Perfected One transformed his sword into a corpse, and a cloud-borne chariot arrived at his gate. Heavenly music filled the doorway, colorful clouds swirled, and fragrant vapors billowed forth as he was borne away in attendance. The people of the capital all saw a column of blue smoke rising straight from the abbey, reaching the heavens and lingering all day without dissipating.\n\nBeside his seat, the Perfected One left three poems:\n\n*Of old in the Yu-Yu Heaven,*\n*I returned to the home of the Supreme.*\n*Humbly entrusted with the register of immortals,*\n*I came and went riding the mist and clouds.*\n*For a time I descended to Wanli City,*\n*Vaguely longing for Golden Flower Peak.*\n*From now on, I shall not tarry long—*\n*I ascend the fragrant chariot into the clouds.*\n\n*Recently I came to the world of men,*\n*From time to time aiding the common folk.*\n*My work of delivering souls now complete,*\n*My service to the state also fulfilled.*\n*Yet I yearn for the joys of the Pure and Subtle—*\n*Who would prize the glory of the mortal realm?*\n*Disciples, fare well in this place,*\n*For I now ascend in clouds to the heights.*\n\n*I withdrew from immortality in this land,*\n*Long since leaving the vulgar world’s glory.*\n*Today I ascend to the clouded heavens,*\n*Returning to truth in the Supreme Clarity.*\n*The mud-pill palace I left as a sign for the world,*\n*My ascent is not for fame.*\n*Let this report be made to those who seek the Dao:*\n*Know that I now journey to the Jade Capital.*\n\nHe also left a letter for his disciple Zhongrong, saying: *\"Present my poems and this letter to the throne. Do not seek office, but attend to the funeral rites for the Imperial Music Bureau, then return to bury me in Guacang. One hundred and sixty years after my departure, a man shall emerge from Maoshan who will surpass even me. If someone practices the Dao in my former dwelling, that shall be the one.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "As they saw him off on his journey, none could contain their grief.\n\nHe added, \"Next year, I shall send word back. Await it here, for when the message arrives, my return will not be long after.\" The following year, on the twenty-seventh day of the first lunar month, suddenly hundreds of black cranes appeared, arrayed from the north, circling and alighting at Ouxi. They lingered for three days, while auspicious clouds of five colors gathered above. After three days, they vanished without a trace.",

Later, Feng Qushe cultivated the Dao there, found them, and thus attained immortality and departed. Now the mountain yields immortal mushrooms and nameless marvels—transformations of the cinnabar radiance left upon the earth.\n\nAfter the Perfected One ascended in clouds, his disciples gathered the poems and letters from his former seat and presented them to the throne. The emperor was moved to tears and personally visited the mourning site, suspending court for three days. From princes and ministers down to all officials and scholars, none failed to grieve deeply. The following day, he posthumously bestowed the title of Governor of Yuezhou. On the sixteenth day, he ordered an imperial portrait of the Perfected One to be painted from memory, and composed an encomium that read:\n\n*\"By the river, essence flows forth,\nIn the garden of virtue, fragrance abides.\nBeyond these, the true qi—\nFrom azure streams, clouds arise.\nPeerless, unmatched,\nTranscendent, unbound.\nO secluded sage, Daoist lord of feng.\"*\n\nEmperor Suzong added his own eulogy:\n\n*\"Lofty and proud, the noble scholar,\nFree and solitary, towering high.\nStanding apart, brushing aside the mist,\nRiding the rainbow, steering the carp.\nFruitful yet unboastful,\nActing yet unattached.\nMounting the wind, serene,\nEver in harmony with all things.\"*\n\nAn imperial edict was also issued, fully recorded in He Zhizhang’s *Preface to the Record of the Mystic Void*. It ordained that the Perfected One’s disciple, Sima Zhongrong, be tonsured as a Daoist priest at the Sacred Perfection Abbey in the Eastern Capital, and that imperial envoys escort the funeral procession to inter him beside the Xuan Yang Abbey. From princes and ministers down to all within the capital, they came forth beyond the Green Gate to bid farewell, the entire city clad in white, all weeping and wailing in sorrow.\n\nUpon reaching Yangzhou, word arrived first from the unseen realm: hundreds of cranes soared above the Grotto-Heaven tomb fields of Guacang. Five-colored clouds lingered for days, not dispersing for half a month.

      "translated_text": "From all directions they gathered in clouds. Heaven altered its hue, and the sun too lost its light. A year after the burial, the coffin opened of its own accord, revealing only robes, cap, sword, and shoes—thus was it known that the Perfected One had not died, but merely ascended lightly in transcendence. The Emperor, ever cherishing the immortal’s bearing, remained endlessly nostalgic. At the abbey, he erected a stele adorned with imperial calligraphy and commanded the Crown Prince to inscribe its title. By the sixth year of Zhenghe in our present dynasty, the Perfected One was specially enfeoffed as Master of the Dao *Zhixu Jiansu*. In the second year of Xuanhe, he was further honored as Perfected *Lingxu Jiansu*. The imperial edicts are preserved at *Chongzhen* in Lishui.\n\nHereafter are compiled the stele inscription composed by Li Yong, along with the Perfected One’s memorials and petitions, imperial rescripts and decrees, and genealogical records.\n\n**Memorial Requesting Return to Hometown**\nYour Daoist servant [so-and-so] humbly states: Your servant is a rustic of rivers and seas, one who has long lacked Daoist cultivation. I have drunk from streams and eaten of trees, dwelling in withered seclusion. Yet when the sagely court opened the gates of the Dao and greatly exalted the mystic model, I was blessed to bathe in the imperial transformation. Serving five reigns, I exhausted loyalty and sincerity, baring my liver and dripping my gall. If I could but render the slightest aid, I would harbor no regret even in ten thousand deaths.\n\nWhen Your Majesty’s sagely court re-established the realm and once more stabilized all beings, every creature possessing consciousness was revived and renewed. Though Your Majesty did not disdain this coarse grass, again gathering me beneath the imperial cap and slippers, my dullness and rusticity were over-rewarded with profound grace. I was falsely entrusted with office among the thorns and brambles, further honored with a fief of thatched simplicity. Praise and glory spread to the very borders, blessings overflowing like springs and seas. Yet how could this face of mine bear such great creation? Even if I ground my body to ashes or severed my head, I could not repay it.\n\nIn a previous year, the celestial grace granted me return to my hometown. My remnant soul, borrowing breath, was able to bow at my ancestral graves, gathering clan and kin in shared sorrow and joy. Yet my parents, now in their declining years—over a hundred and thirty years old—upon seeing this servant return to the hills and valleys, were at once overjoyed and sorrowful. Scarcely ten days passed before they suddenly departed. Though life and death are decreed by fate and principle is thus fixed, flesh and blood share feeling—how could there be no grief? The ailments of many years erupted in a single morning. My form and countenance withered and weakened, scarcely able to endure what once was.",

      "translated_text": "Though lately bound to the mortal realm, my spirit transcends all worldly entanglements. I had hoped to receive the essential teachings of the Three Clarities, to proclaim the harmony of the Six Qi, and to offer these to Your Majesty’s person, aiding in the governance of the realm. Moreover, the principle of radiant felicity resides in the manifold mysteries. Yet the vastness of my devotion, like the rivers and seas, finds no fulfillment in this request. You would do well to sever this petition and deeply consider my sentiments.\n\n**Memorial of the Perfected One Seeking to Return Home to Repair Ancestral Tombs**\nYour servant, the Daoist Minister [name omitted], respectfully states: On the twentieth day of the second month, though afflicted by illness, I laid bare my sincerity and specially beseeched that my lingering soul be permitted to return home to repair the ancestral tombs. Yet the lofty heavens did not heed, and the earth beneath me offered no refuge. Thus, my old ailments flared, and my remaining life hung by a thread. Before I could take leave of this sagely age, I was suddenly transformed into another being. Fortunately, by the boundless grace of Heaven’s nurturing embrace, I was not yet consigned to the yellow springs. My remaining life was spared, and my humble wish was granted.\n\nEarlier, I received the imperial edict permitting my return to my native place. Having treasured the dragon jade, I traversed mountains and rivers. Day and night, I was circumspect, reverently bearing the mandate of the state. Yet upon nearing my hometown, the season pressed with severe cold. Years of poor harvests had driven the people to flee, and my kin suffered from hunger. The rites of kinship were obscured, and my private wish to erect a stele could not be fulfilled. The stele stone still remains in Suzhou, unable to reach my hometown. My heart burns with anguish, my tears flow as blood, and each day feels like a year. If this wish remains unfulfilled, I shall not close my eyes in death.\n\nI humbly beseech Your Majesty, whose nurturing care extends even to the smallest creatures, allowing all to follow their nature. The teachings of filial piety reach all living beings. My skin and bones are but hollow vessels, my life as fleeting as a candle in the wind. I beg that my last breath may yet be granted. If my wish is heard, even the Nine Springs shall hold no regret. Though I must soon depart from the imperial presence, my illness lingers by rivers and lakes. Prostrate upon my sickbed, my grief and longing overflow. With utmost reverence, I present this memorial at the palace hall for Your Majesty’s consideration.\n\nYour servant, in awe and trembling, prostrates himself in fear and dread. A thousand deaths, a thousand deaths—this unworthy one presents himself thus.\n\nMemorial submitted on the twenty-third day of the second month, the fourth year of the Kaiyuan era. By the Minister in Attendance [name omitted].\n\n**Imperial Rescript:** The memorial has been received and noted in full. The master’s being embodies the manifold mysteries, his Dao surpassing that of the immortals. His subtlety and purity attain the true and clear. Through his aid, transformation is wrought. Yet his heartfelt plea, though made in illness, longs for return. His memorials have been repeatedly received, his words and sentiments ever more earnest. Now, in accordance with his request, his wish is granted.\n\n**Memorial of the Perfected One Seeking to Confer His Father’s Posthumous Title**\nI have heard that the greatness of filial piety is the foremost of human conduct. Thus, the vastness of Heaven’s embrace, though wordless, elicited a response from the divine maiden’s scroll. The boundless earth, though silent, manifested the river carp as an offering. Such is the resonance between the spirits and Heaven and Earth.\n\nI humbly reflect that Your Majesty’s filial devotion equals that of Heaven and Earth, your sageliness matching that of the gods. In Qi Prefecture, auspicious lingzhi mushrooms sprouted; at the imperial mausoleum, sweet dew descended. These are the responses to Your Majesty’s filial piety, and thus felicity should extend to all beings. I am fortunate to live in an age governed by filial principle, to witness with my own eyes these numinous signs. Yet I, possessing no merit greater than bending a blade of grass, have vainly received the gift of a thatched hut. The rank of the Nine Ministers is as vast as the rivers and seas; the title of the Five Orders corresponds to the stars and constellations. My days are numbered, and the yellow springs draw near. My parents, who gave me life, have yet to receive recompense for their toil. The grace Your Majesty has bestowed upon me is weightier than mountains.\n\nThough I am but a humble creature, how could I be without feeling? Since my shameful inclusion in the court’s ranks, I have lived in constant dread, day and night. In life, I have brought no benefit to this sagely age; in death, I shall truly betray this prosperous era. Yet the private sentiments of this old dog or aging horse run deep. I beseech that the titles and ranks bestowed upon me by Your Majesty be posthumously conferred upon my late father. Thus, I shall neither violate Your Majesty’s filial example nor fail to fulfill my own boundless devotion. If this wish is granted, even a thousand deaths would be a blessing.\n\nMoreover, my skin is wrinkled like a chicken’s, my hair white as a crane’s, my body thus reduced. My lingering soul borrows qi, but my end may come at any moment. Last winter, I took leave of the court and traveled by carriage, afflicted by illness. By Your Majesty’s nurturing virtue, I was spared and rejoiced in survival, permitted once more to approach the Purple Chamber and tread the Vermilion Steps. Now, with my remaining breath, I lay bare my humble sincerity.\n\nI beseech that the generous emoluments and wealth bestowed upon me be returned to the imperial treasury, and that the official titles and honorific names be conferred upon the gates of the netherworld. Thus, my clan shall gather in joy, and our ancestral line shall unite in heart and soul. In life and death, I would be most fortunate—words fail to express my gratitude.\n\nI humbly pray that Your Majesty’s compassion may abundantly permit this. Though my life cannot be restored, even a hundred bodies could not repay this debt. My grief and sorrow overflow, my entreaties know no end. With utmost reverence, I present this memorial at the palace gate for Your Majesty’s consideration.\n\nYour servant, in awe and trembling, prostrates himself in fear and dread. A thousand deaths, a thousand deaths—this unworthy one presents himself thus.\n\nMemorial submitted on the twenty-third day of the second month, the fourth year of the Kaiyuan era. By the Minister in Attendance [name omitted].\n\n**Imperial Rescript:** The memorial has been received and noted in full. The master’s name ascends to the immortal realms, his talents surpassing the pivot of the Dao. He has safeguarded my person. I do not forget the ranks and titles bestowed in the morning court. Matters of state are governed by impartiality. Having examined his petition and discerned his sentiments, I recognize the depth of his filial piety. I esteem and commend his virtue in fostering customs and elevating morals. The master’s reverence for yielding and humility makes it difficult to grant his request. The posthumous conferral he seeks shall be handled separately.\n\n**Stele Inscription of the Late Perfected Master Ye of the Dao**\n*Composed and inscribed by Li Yong of Jiangxia*\n\nOf old, the birth of the Venerable Lord unfolded the Dao, pure as Heaven and Earth. The birth of the Virtuous Master endowed him with a body bearing the sun and moon. Yet when the lords of the age did not honor him, and the masters of the time did not employ him, he concealed his brilliance in deep valleys, coiled his presence in secluded mountains. His hidden essence shed its earthly form, his plain integrity perpetuated the lineage of immortals. How could his avoidance of fate and conduct be merely rewarded with ranks and robes?\n\nThe Master’s personal name was Guozhong, his courtesy name Yazhen. He was a native of Yexian in Nanyang. From Shaohao, he inherited the blessings; from Gaoxin, he continued the lineage. Through the flourishing reign of Yao, and the sowing of Hou Ji, the descendants of King Wen received their fief in Shen. The son of Yin Shu was enfeoffed in Ye, where his clan received its surname and enjoyed the state’s favor.

      "translated_text": "The Master refined his secluded chambers and sealed the gates to summon the myriad spirits. His physique was robust, his talents towering; he mastered principles and amassed arts. Though carriages of state arrived in succession, he steadfastly declined all offers. Thus, his blessed lineage flourished, and his years stretched long.\n\nHis father, Daoxing, guarded the inner courts by nature and disseminated the Dao throughout the realm. When dwelling among ghosts, he followed the earth; when leading as master, spirits followed heaven. He received the celestial registers with reverence, dispatched flying talismans to the north, and suppressed the malevolence of demons. He eradicated the curses of Liu Taidai—how extraordinary! As for drawing the bow to pierce grass and leather or leaping into wells to strike, he uniquely established the Five Departments, greatly expanding the refined and abundant. Who could succeed such a legacy?\n\nThe Master inherited the Daoist lineage with divine favor, receiving rare teachings and guidance. Though young in years and modest in appearance, he was devoted to the true and steadfast. His immortal bones bore signs, his childlike heart remained untainted. He concentrated on the Five Dragons and roamed the grassy peaks. His keen hearing discerned the distant, his bright vision perceived the subtle. He grasped the omens of life and death, embodied the transformations of qi and matter. Often, when stillness preserved essence and movement depleted it, he withdrew his shadow to return home. Beyond the clouds, he dwelled in secluded valleys; in the forests, he made his immortal abode. No neighbors approached, and the Way was treacherous to the right. Yet he journeyed alone to hidden wonders, forever singing the songs of reclusion. Free and at ease, he preserved harmony, practicing emptiness to attain stillness. He sipped the marrow of the Five Stones, plucked the blossoms of the Three Sacred Fungi. Time did not linger, and the seasons passed. Though his temples turned as black as lacquer, his youthful complexion remained flushed with cinnabar. His affairs aligned with the mysterious, his spirit merged with the Dao. In utter silence and vast stillness, he abstained from drink and food for decades. Thereupon, his fame reached the imperial court. The emperor’s favor surged, and he was honored with deference. They sent him literary steeds and swift chariots, but the Master lingered, gestured with a long bow, and waved his hand in high refusal. He said: \"Of old, when Emperor Shun was elevated, his virtue shone brightly. When Guangwu succeeded the throne, the governance of officials was most excellent. Moreover, Xue Fang and Feng Meng were accorded the rites of foreign ministers, while Yu Zhong and Yi Yi pursued the work of recluses. How could one sullied by the vulgar, flawed by worldly things, or partial in tribute—one whose nature inclines toward the Dao and admires its kind—sit idly to attain extraordinary longevity? The imperial envoys harbored doubts about my silence, yet I have fulfilled my intent to depart.\" He then surveyed the huts and granaries, examined his own body and flesh. He inspected the altars of the astronomers and inquired of his household servants about their duties. All were frugal and adhered to simplicity, maintaining their beginnings. Their food was not sweet to the palate, their appearance did not please the eye. Truly, they embodied sincerity and cast off falsehood, daring to uphold what was difficult to seize. If one could follow the wind, why force oneself to rise? Thus, he returned to the empty observatory to fulfill his destiny, ashamed to sigh at the news. The court longed for his loftiness, thirsted for his Dao, and listened for his praises. Those who yearned for him—how could words suffice?\n\nThe officials reported that the celestial records of the Heavenly Stem were incomplete, the astral offices neglected. The succession of the Five Virtues was lost, the divisions of the Four Seasons confused. Jing’s ghosts and Yue’s omens were unrecognized; the origins of *zi-hai* and *mu-gui* were unknown. All urgently sought him from afar, requesting transmission of the teachings. This could be called: \"When the plumb line is truly aligned, crooked and straight are revealed; when the scale is truly hung, light and heavy are established.\" Alas, among erudite scholars, how could such matters be mere trivial talk from rustic scholars?\n\nAlas! Heaven does not endure forever, and man must return. His declining years pressed toward a century, his distant aspirations thwarted by decay. He chose a burial site in a secluded valley, entrusting his tomb to a pure grove. The reclusive were not pursued, the state’s finest had no statutes to follow. Springs and stones mourned in discoloration, his homeland and county lost their voice. Was there no one else? It was because of him. His heir, Huiming, was posthumously granted the title of Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, Silver and Cyan, and Prefect of Shezhou. The Master never neglected his county, each generation enhancing its legacy. He unlocked the mysteries of secret records, spreading the great waves of the Dark Ford. The Dao was faint as an echo, the heart subtle as qi. Blowing the pitch-pipes warmed the valleys, calculating the calendar revealed heaven’s patterns. Though imperial summons arrived repeatedly, he never answered.\n\nHis grandson, the Daoist of Jinglong Abbey, Honglu Qing, Duke of Yue, and Fashan, received his father’s teachings early and inherited the perfected methods. Reverently mindful of his instructions, he surpassed near and far in his own person. He read the books of the world, prepared defenses beyond its borders. Fire cleansed excessive attachments, the sword slew demons in his grasp. His kindness opened the way for the Five Lords, his name stirred the Four Lands. When entering, he pushed aside golden rings and locks to pay homage at the Purple Court, serving as the emperor’s proud official. When departing, he followed the Jade Capital, sat in the Dark Temple, and became a master to all. Thus, he became the great artisan of the Daoist gate, the household minister of the court’s right. He dined with ritual at the carriage’s side, lodged in the forbidden precincts.\n\nHe always strengthened himself through the principles of qi, growing stronger with age. Though no shadow hastened his steps, his filial piety was most profound. He presented a memorial, wishing to visit his ancestral tomb. The emperor, moved by his words, twice issued royal decrees. Divine talismans flew, and auspicious transmissions were dispatched. The Duke of Zhangmao hosted a farewell banquet, while the feudal lords welcomed him beyond the suburbs. Courtly splendor shone, and his countrymen rejoiced. Though bending with lesser arts, he exalted his filial heart. In pursuing the former will to honor the distant, he erected a grand stele to record virtue. How could one ask why? Its inscription reads:\n\nThe lineage’s culture was pure in conduct, the family’s generations hidden immortals.\nThe Dao was one in mutual gestation, the torch passed in succession.\nThe Yellow Elder guarded the past, the Red Waters strung pearls.\nThe Dao unlocked hidden keys, nature merged with the true root.\nA single gate spanned ancestors, four directions endured a hundred years.\nThey defied traces in cliffs and valleys, silenced fame in heaven and earth.\nLofty and distant in their ascent, their noble bearing was radiant.\nMusk burns for its fragrance, pearls fall for their brilliance.\nMen have hearts, yet omens do not arrive.\nPreserving the self is no theft, preserving simplicity is profit.\nThe filial grandson enhanced the legacy, enlightened rulers followed the wind.\nHis aspirations were never unworthy, though affairs differed.\nSummons for worthies filled the court, recluses emptied the mountains.\nHow could one rest on high pillows, repaying the work of the age?\nPerceiving the subtle, grasping change, exhausting the rules to offer loyalty.\nThough imperial favor was profound, filial devotion ran deeper.\nOfficial robes gathered, transmitted arts flourished.\nThough he departed the court’s halls, he visited the tomb’s groves.\nInscribing stone to honor the distant, engraving words to express the heart.\nFilial piety and loyalty stood as affairs, glory and favor adorn the present.",

That night, as the hour grew late and the bell tolled, Master Li awoke to find his writing unfinished, yet the stele remained unchanged.\n\n---\n\n**Stele of the Perfected One’s Father**\n**Divine Path Stele of the Tang Dynasty’s Posthumously Appointed Cishi of Huanzhou, Lord Ye, with Preface**\n\nComposed by Li Yong of Jiangxia\nCalligraphed and inscribed by Han Zemu, Student of the Directorate of Education\n\nThe Lord’s personal name was Huiming;\nHis courtesy name, Dezhao, and he hailed from Nanyang.\nHis ancestry traced back to the Yellow Emperor, extending through King Wen of Zhou.\nWhen the state of Shen was enfeoffed upon Ziguo, and the fief of Ye granted to Zigao, the surname was thus established.\nIn later generations, some governed with the wisdom of Confucius, while others, enamored of dragons, attained the true Dao—each era bore men of renown.\n\nOf old, when the imperial mandate arose, the sagely radiance shone forth.\nWind and cloud followed in accord, divination and dreams resonated in harmony.\nAuspicious qi surged forth, and worthy ministers arrived in great numbers.\nWhat opens must have a beginning, and all things take form through reliance.\nThis is the natural order—thus was our Lord.\nDescending from the celestial府, he rode the currents of the Dao.\nTracing the footsteps of recluses, he called out to the hidden elders.\nHe built his hut by the streamside, roamed the steep valleys.\n\"With like-minded men, profit in constancy; in times of retreat, do not act.\"\nHe deeply cherished the virtue of wine and delved profoundly into the *Laozi*.\nHis words brought laughter and enlightenment, his principles inspired awe.\nHe guided others tirelessly, embracing all with empty openness and joy.\nMen of worth gathered at his gate, elders filled his lane.\nWhen the moon rose behind curtains and gentle winds stirred the groves,\nHe leaned on his staff and whistled in the valleys, sat on hides and played the qin upon the mountains.\nAt ease, he delighted in life; serene, he forgot old age.\nHe nurtured his nature, his lifespan neared that of immortals.\nHe followed the wanderings of Red Pine, embraced the guardianship of the Yellow and the Old.\nHe placed his body after all things, returned to the root, and attained suppleness.\nHe followed the Great Balance, upheld the Great Stability.\nColors and principles did not sway him; honor and disgrace did not disturb him.\nEver content, ever joyful—\nThe bearing of one of utmost virtue, unfathomable indeed.\nThus, masters and elders honored him with banners and rites; the state and clans were transformed by him.\nThe wise called him wise; the benevolent called him benevolent.\nThough he wore coarse hemp and lived by mulberry and hinge,\nAll avoided him on the road, showing reverence, holding the wind in awe, and breathing with caution.\n\nHis virtue was renowned in his household, and his descendants flourished.\nThen came our Lord Yue, who inherited his father’s virtue, extending blessings through his numinous birth and innate knowledge.\nHe learned and practiced diligently,\nPossessing the talent of a specialist and inheriting a grand legacy.\nHis talent and Dao matured together; upon reaching adulthood, he was one with the mysterious.\nHe sought the blessed courts of distant peaks, observed the esoteric arts of the reclusive masters.\nHis incantations shook thunder, his blades flashed like lightning.\nHe waded through the deep sea without getting wet, trod upon cold without feeling heat.\nHe commanded ten thousand ghosts, subdued a hundred spirits.\nHe opened the talismans of the nether bureaus, altered the records of the underworld.\nHe traced past events to their roots, sat and knew the future.\nThe blind and obscured could not hide their forms from him; mist and dew could not aggravate his ailments.\nHis marvelous deeds multiplied, his praiseworthy reputation spread daily.\nThus, the Great Lord rejoiced, and imperial summons repeatedly arrived.\nHe entered the inner chambers, consulted on omens and portents.\nEvery word he spoke came to pass; every matter he addressed was apt.\nFour eras passed, five dynasties succeeded.\nHe followed the wind to petition the Celestial Master, drew near the imperial throne with reverence.\nNeither monks nor laymen could surpass him; even high ministers deferred to his left.\nWhen the state performed rites to heaven and earth, or offered sacrifices to seas and mountains,\nThe Lord always presented offerings and jade, ensuring the rituals were pure and the sacrifices refined.\nFour-horse carriages filled the roads; prefectures and counties welcomed him thrice yearly.\nOf late, treacherous ministers hoarded calamity, petty men spread corruption.\nDaring to lead the rebellion, they kindled this dire crisis.\nThe heavenly path was not yet smooth; human affairs were about to begin.\nThe Lord then exhaustively expounded the esoteric and assisted the sagely plans.\nHe divined the stars and selected auspicious days, hastening to the offices of observation.\nAs a pillar of the state, he addressed the sovereign’s concerns first and last.\nHe aided in the extermination of the chief villain and the restoration of the imperial line.\nFor his extraordinary merits, his loyalty was extolled.\nHonors and rewards adorned his person; favor and posthumous titles illuminated his father.\nHad it not been for this father, how could the son have been instructed?\nHad it not been for this son, how could the father’s name have been exalted?\nThe pine and cypress have been planted, yet the stele remains unerected.\nSeeking to cherish him through the ages, his filial piety is thus preserved.\nRepeated requests were made to the court, yet the land by the river was deemed sufficient.\nFar and wide, talented men were sought; even this humble one was reluctantly summoned.\nLike Zhao Kuo discussing warfare, I lack the learning of old;\nLike Ban Gu writing history, I rely on family records.\nLooking upon this completed text, I prostrate myself in shame before the enduring stone.\n\nIts inscription reads:\nThe Perfected One, though reclusive, was not ashamed;\nThe Transcendent, though silent, shed his form.\nAlas, standing alone, he longed for the distant past.\nNearly attaining mysterious virtue, he ascended to behold the cinnabar classics.\nUnstained by his homeland, his radiance harmonized without striving.\nHe built his hut on the islet, gathered herbs to the left, and transmitted the qin.\nSlowly he whistled in the windy valley, leisurely he strolled in the moonlit forest.\nWhite clouds delighted his heart; clear springs cleansed his mind.\nWhat marvel did he not witness? What wonder did he not attend?\nAs the spirit drew near, emotions deepened with the land.\nThe age revered his methods; the imperial house had not yet honored him.\nThen came his illustrious son, who carried forth his virtuous legacy.\nLike Zuo Ci, he summoned things; like the man of Yue, he discerned colors.\nHe oversaw the schemes of ghosts, employed the power of spirits.\nFavor was bestowed by five sovereigns; his fame reached the eight directions.\nWhen the sun was often eclipsed and the state faced many hardships,\nRebellion spread, and loyal hearts burned with indignation.\nYet he foresaw all, aiding in the esoteric plans.\nAugust and divine, the Emperor’s decree was resplendent.\nSwiftly he took up arms, quelling the chaos.\nThe Emperor, mindful of his merits, granted him rank and land.\nNot for his own glory, but to honor his father.\nThe imperial domain bestowed crimson tassels; purple sashes were conferred.\nIn life, he achieved honor; in death, his loyalty and filial piety were fulfilled.\nRow upon row of pines and cypresses stir the wind with sorrow.\nThe tomb lacks a marker; his virtue remains unrecorded.\nAlas, the solemn dust! How profound the filial thoughts!\nWho will transmit this through the ages? This grand stele is erected.\n\nPosthumously appointed Huiming as Silver-and-Cyan Light of the Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, Cishi of Shezhou; his son, the Daoist Fashan, was granted the title Minister of Ceremonies and Duke of Yue.",

      "translated_text": "In the seventh year of Kaiyuan, fifth cycle, the year Ding Si in the asterism Chunwei, the seventh day of the Jiachen cycle was established.\n\nDecree posthumously appointing [Leaf] as Prefect of Yuezhou:\nThe late Daoist master [Leaf], whose full titles and positions are recorded, embodied celestial purity and subtle profundity, his wondrous principles flowing with mysterious clarity. He encompassed esoteric essentials and elucidated divine talismans. Though his depths were as inscrutable as the silent and formless, rarely fathomed, his heart dwelled in the Peng orchard while his conduct harmonized with the five dynasties. He upheld the yellow cap without wavering, and though the purple sash was bestowed, it brought no vanity. Towering in solitary fragrance, he wandered alone with serene detachment. His transcendent qi severed worldly ties; his true wind left no dust. His golden bones rose externally; his pearl-like radiance shone within. Thus did his form align with the middle immortals, his name ascend among the highest virtue.\n\nIn moments of leisure from governance, We repeatedly inquired of the supreme Dao. He, with the methods of ordering the state, presented enlightened counsel time and again. His strategies bore subtle admonitions; his affairs brought great benefit. We lament that his illustrious voice has not yet faded, grieve that his bodily dissolution came so swiftly. Why should such a one be taken? The sudden loss of this worthy weighs heavily upon Us. It is fitting to extend posthumous honors, to adorn his resting place with due ceremony.\nThus, he is posthumously appointed Prefect of Yuezhou.\n\nImperially Composed Stele for the Perfected One:\nStele inscription and preface for the late Grand Master of the Golden Purple, Minister of Ceremonies and Duke of Yue, Abbot of Jinglong Abbey, posthumously appointed Prefect of Yuezhou, Master Leaf.\nThis stele was inscribed by the Emperor’s own hand; the title was written by the Crown Prince.\n\nWe have heard: Among the Three August Ones and Five Emperors, the most eminent was the veneration of Guangcheng. In the eras of Tang and Yu, the most eminent was the instruction of Yin Shou. Thus, with the Dao of the sage, one teaches the talent of the sage. After guarding it for seven days, then guarding it for nine days, one attains morning clarity and thereafter perceives the Dao alone. Entering water without getting wet, treading fire without feeling heat, whistling to summon wind and rain, lashing demons and spirits—without fixed method, one may thus advance all things. This is the numinous alone. The numinous is ever-changing; the Dao likewise pervades all. If one finds such a person, this is what is meant by \"establishing teaching through the numinous Dao.\"\n\nThe Master’s tabooed name was Fashan, his courtesy name Daoyuan. Since Zhu Liang received his fief, he was called the Lord of Ye. The district shared the name, and thus the surname was bestowed. Formerly, he was a man of Nanyang. His great-grandfather was Dao Xing, his grandfather Guo Zhong, his father Hui Shan, posthumously appointed Prefect of Shezhou. Those who adorned the gardens and fields upheld Our Dao as one thread; those who partook of ancient virtue could know it for a hundred generations. Thus, his name filled the cosmos while his person dwelled upon rivers and seas—now he is a man of Gu Kuo.\n\nIn the year Bingzi of the Daye era of the Sui, the Master was born. Six hundred forty-two cycles of sixty years passed until the year Gengshen of Our Kaiyuan era, when he dissolved his form and ascended upon the clouds. His spring and autumn numbered one hundred and seven. From Bingzi to Gengshen spanned one hundred and five years; accounting for intercalary months, the count of six hundred forty-two cycles of sixty years is thus confirmed, totaling one hundred and seven years.\n\nIn his birth, though advanced in years, his complexion remained that of a child. In his transformation, he shed his mortal form and his spirit became a silent immortal. He often accompanied Us in Our travels; the more We looked up to him, the loftier he seemed; the more We delved into him, the more steadfast he appeared. His hidden observations left no trace; his subtle allurements were unfathomable. If one spoke of aiding the state and assisting",

      "translated_text": "At the outset, when the Master was but seven years old, he wandered by the river for nearly three years, and people believed he had drowned. Upon his return, when asked the reason, he replied: \"Three Azure Lads led me to rest in a towering hall of resplendent chambers. I swallowed divine elixirs and sipped cloud-borne nectar; the Supreme Lord oversaw me, and thus I remained.\" At fifteen, he was poisoned unto death, yet again he saw the Azure Lads of old, who said: \"Lord Mao of Tiantai has sent his flying seal.\" The seal pressed upon his abdomen, and at first he fell into suffocating darkness. After a long while, clarity returned. The Master’s numinous responsiveness and spiritual communion were extraordinary indeed.\n\nThereupon, he staff in hand, roamed through famous mountains, seeking Lord Mao from afar until he encountered him. His skeletal frame rose like a peak, his pupils were square, his bearing as pristine as ice and snow, and he smiled faintly, saying: \"Have you come? Your name is already inscribed in the register of immortals. You have met with demonic trials, and thus I rescued you to spare you. You should set your mind on aiding others and assisting the teachings, without hastening toward departure or return.\" Thereafter, he received from Zhao Yuanyang of Qingcheng the arts of *dunjia* and *buxuan*; from Wei Shanjun of Songgao, he transmitted the Way of the Eight Histories and Cloud-Striding. He reposed on Luofu and Kuocang, journeyed to and fro between Penglai and Fangzhang. Numinous charts and secret formulas, immortal talismans and true scriptures, veritable records and life contracts—all were transmitted through mysterious resonance and empty revelation. With a single glance, eighteen thousand spirits appeared; by swallowing the embryonic breath, one thousand two hundred cycles were sustained. At times, he swam hidden in water palaces; at others, he strode flying through fire chambers. Sometimes he split open his abdomen to wash his intestines, recovering without medicine; sometimes he gouged out his eyes to remove their membranes, casting talismans to restore them. At times, he concocted deadly poisons and consumed them with indifference; at others, he summoned ghostly beings, who arrived at his command. He rebuked drought demons, and the host of spirits fled like servants. Thus, he was renowned throughout the land, his transformations myriad.\n\nThe former court favored him, granting audience thrice in a single day. While We resided in the princely manor, We repeatedly heard the essentials of the Dao. Upon ascending to the county of Linyu, We cherished his forthright counsel. When treacherous ministers harbored schemes and rebels usurped, he never failed to forewarn Us, offering profound and timely aid. Therefore, We specially bestowed upon him the purple sash and enfeoffed him as Grand Duke. Yet he remained steadfast in the Yellow Center, declining the honors of cap and carriage. Truly, his virtue was vast in its bestowal, his Dao exalted in its radiance.\n\nWhen he came, there was no boasting—it was the Master’s time; when he departed, there was no resentment—it was the Master’s compliance. In the year of *Chunwei*, the month of *Chunhuo*, if he transformed and departed in the *Gengshen* year, it would align with the actual year. Yet as the *Chen* month of *Chunshou* appears in earlier and later stele records with discrepancies, We do not wish to alter it lightly. At that time, his treasures... returning to truth, suspended and unbound.",

      "translated_text": "On the first day of the month, he was posthumously enfeoffed as Governor of Yuezhou. In the *Yu* month, he returned to be interred in the Kuocang Mountains. He was exempted from court regalia, in accordance with his long-held aspiration.\n\nThe Master possessed an extraordinary nature, his bearing marked by singular integrity. His spirit shone beyond his form, his bones refined, his appearance noble. Thus, Master Wan addressed him, saying: \"Your writings fulfill the criteria for transcendence; soon you shall ascend to the Celestial Palace. I shall follow you to become your peer.\" Truly, as the *Book of Changes* states: \"The noble one may emerge or remain in reclusion—yet those who emerge know not the leisure of mountains and forests, while those who remain know not the honors of cap and carriage.\" Though the Dao is one and the responses harmonious, the paths differ and cannot be pursued simultaneously. The Master nurtured his spirit in the Great Harmony, contemplating the wondrous Mystery and the Dark Womb—this was the noble one’s fulfillment in reclusion. The golden seal was truly precious, the purple sash soon to arrive—this was the noble one’s fulfillment in emergence. Had his Dao not attained vastness and greatness, had his virtue not aligned with the numinous, who could have achieved such a state? Thus, in service to the royal house, he received favor through five generations; in Our time, those who transmitted the Dao numbered several—his status as a patriarchal master was beyond question.\n\nThose who compose texts record the truth; those who extol virtue esteem its teachings. The Master knew Us; how could We not recount him? Truly, his deeds were without shame, and his writings may be examined as evidence.\n\n**Inscription:**\nSudden and vigorous, none fail to emerge from it.\nSerene and pure, none fail to enter it.\nThe source of all flourishing,\nThe spring of all transformations.\nIn this, contemplate the wondrous—\nTruly, he ranks among the Immortals.\nWhat are the Immortals?\nThey dissolve transformation and reverse aging.\nWhat is the wondrous?\nHow could it rely on the Ultimate Dao?\nPervading the hidden and aiding the obscure,\nHis spirit transforms and his numen creates.\nHe eradicated pernicious shrines and malevolent influences,\nNo concealment escaped his scrutiny.\nHis poems countered rebellion and aided compliance,\nHis achievements assisted the times.\nConcealing the past and discerning the subtle,\nHis work aligned with the divine.\nHonors were bestowed in increasing measure,\nYet he remained untainted by future deceit.\nHe regarded worldly ties as if discarding them,\nLeaving Us in wistful reflection.\nGreat possession, primal auspiciousness—\nThe Yellow Center penetrates principle.\nSilently, the transcendent shed his mortal form,\nHis mystery boundless and eternal.\nLike the flight seen in Yexian,\nLike the crane alighting on the distant sea.\nThe numinous wind flourishes in its majesty,\nThriving through a thousand ages.\n\nIn the twenty-seventh year of the *Kaiyuan* era, the year *Jimao*, on the twenty-sixth day of the second month (the first day being *Jiwei*), he departed by riding transformation. Though he has gone, his old affections remain undiminished; thus, his deeds are recorded. By the shores of the immortal mountains and seas, the stele endures. *\"Departed by riding transformation\"*—these twenty-four characters appear in the old text and are retained here without deletion.\n\n**Memorial of Disciple Ding Zhengguan and Others, Expressing Gratitude for the Bestowal of the Stele Inscription for the Perfected One Xie Ci:**\nThe Daoist of the *Suming* Abbey within the *Jie* era, Yin Xi, announced the imperial edict issued within the *Jie* era, bestowing it upon the Master of Our Sect. We, kneeling to receive the celestial decree, gaze upon the imperial brush. Overwhelmed with awe and joy, we are filled with both celebration and sorrow. Though unworthy, we are among his disciples; our gratitude and shame are boundless. Respectfully, we record and present this memorial in gratitude. Memorial submitted on the twenty-third day of the fourth month in the twenty-seventh year of the *Kaiyuan* era by the Daoist Ding Zhengguan of the *Jinglong* Abbey and others.\n\n**Edict Conferring the Title of Master of Emptiness and Simplicity:**\nIn the *Jie* era, the Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, Minister of Rites, Duke of Yue, and Celestial Master for Protecting the State and Numinous Perfection, Ye [Mou]:\nThose who cultivate the Dao act without seeking fame, and others cannot name them—this is why the perfected abandon names. Yet when promoting goodness and reproving evil, establishing teachings for posterity, names serve as outward signs. Even those who govern the realm cannot dispense with them. Having studied the Dao and attained the method, he extricated himself from the mire of defilement. Now, centuries later, his sword and sandals remain as if alive, still responding to the world and the people. Though he did not seek the ranks of prayer and supplication, he naturally attained them. We merely adjust his title to comfort the people of the region. Let him be specially enfeoffed as *Master of Emptiness and Simplicity*. The twenty-first day of the first month in the sixth year of the *Zhenghe* era.\n\n**Edict Conferring the Title of Perfected One of Numinous Emptiness and Simplicity:**\nIn the *Jie* era, We embody the wondrous Dao to govern Ourself and propagate the pure wind to nurture the world. Whenever We recall the titles of lofty perfected ones, We are moved by the footsteps of those who came before. The Perfected One of Emptiness and Simplicity, Ye Fashan, was a transcendent minister of the Great Ultimate and a feathered guest of Kuocang. He swept away demonic evil and extinguished calamities, subdued specters and startled demons into flight. Thus, during the *Kaiyuan* era, he repeatedly manifested traces of a transformed being, his depths unfathomable, all arising naturally. Though the name *Emptiness and Simplicity* is but a provisional designation, the previous edicts of governance and peace already reflect our reverence. How could We forget to further honor *Numinous Emptiness* to manifest his sublime mystery? Let him be specially enfeoffed as *Perfected One of Numinous Emptiness and Simplicity*. The twenty-fifth day of the sixth month in the second year of the *Xuanhe* era.\n\n**The Transmission of the Tang Perfected One Ye Concludes.**",
