Li Gong of the Two Rivers, a disciple of the Master of the Daoist Lineage, requested that I obtain several hundred Daoist scriptures from the capital, all of which were texts missing from Shu.\n\nAmong them, ritualistic liturgy was predominant, so I commissioned Master Taigu to compare and reconcile their differences, to examine antiquity and distinguish the present.\n\nFrom the foundational teachings for novices to the advanced rites of practice, he meticulously compiled them into a collection for the benefit of future generations, coinciding with my tenure as the Yellow Arrow Register of the Two Rivers.\n\nScholars and practitioners from all directions gathered in homage, and thus the texts were engraved upon wooden tablets for all to share.\n\nI have often lamented my inability to contribute, as some merely stand by with folded arms, while others mock or even suppress these teachings, unwilling to utter a single word to my disciples.\n\nIs this not contrary to the Celestial Master’s intent, which was to foster growth and abundance? If the Daoist lineage lacks scriptures, should not those who share this vision strive to emulate the spirit of Zhengyi and Guangcheng, thereby upholding the grand tradition?\n\nIn the summer of the year *Jiaxu* of the *Jiatai* era, Master Lü Yuansu of Jiangyuan, the recluse of the Northern Peak, composed this work.\n\nIn ancient times, the Son of Heaven sacrificed to Heaven and Earth, communing with the divine, all with solemn rites—pure offerings, meticulous attire, preliminary fasting, and then the full observance, lest the ritual fail to honor the spirits and the sacrifice be incomplete. How much more so for commoners?\n\nThus, the Celestial Master expounded the scriptures and established precepts, prioritizing compassion over killing. Following this, the Celestial Master established his teachings, transforming sacrifices into *zhaijiao* rites, mirroring Heaven and Earth, offering reverence, reciting scriptures, and dispatching talismans to convey prayers, all to elevate grand rituals and refine pure sacrifices.\n\nTherefore, hymns and odes were composed to praise the Daoist temples, where words became music, and it was said that sound could reach the divine, invoking blessings from above and below. The *Changxu* (recitation of talismans) and *Yongdong* (chanting of scriptures) were derived from this principle, and their essence was unchanging.\n\nSince the Celestial Master’s establishment of his teachings, those among the Daoist lineage who focused on ritualistic precepts often neglected the study of sound, while those who mastered sound often lacked the full complement of ritualistic observances.\n\nThis is akin to Gongshu Bu’s skill—without the compass and square, how could he measure the perfect circles and squares?\n\nIn the Song dynasty, the Lü family of Helin compiled the Daoist scriptures, gathering their mysteries into a collection they titled *The Comprehensive Teachings Collection* (通教集).\n\nFrom the imperial court to the common folk, for the sake of the nation, the family, the living, and the dead, those who practiced *zhao* (ritual fasting) and *jiao* (exorcism) revered Daoist teachings universally, all finding partial illumination.\n\nIt was also to ensure that students of the Dao would master the precepts through ritualistic discipline, thereby comprehending its teachings. His intent was indeed broad.\n\nHe Gong of Yuntai further elucidated these principles, enabling practitioners to refine and master the rituals, and compiled *The Refined Teachings Collection* (炼教集), which has since circulated widely.\n\nWithin these two collections, there are mutual strengths and weaknesses, and those who study them cannot help but raise questions.\n\nNow, Master Ma Daoyi of Jincheng’s Three Wells Observance, who has long resided among the Daoist elite, has devoted years to the study of ritualistic texts without ever abandoning them.\n\nThus, he merged *The Comprehensive Teachings Collection* (通教集) and *The Refined Teachings Collection* (炼教集), selecting their finest elements, categorizing them into a single volume, and engraved it for wider dissemination.\n\nHe entrusted me with a preface to explain his purpose. I replied: In matters of scholarship, I have always taken care. Within the realm of ritual teachings, my knowledge has been neglected for many years.\n\nYet you have taken this as a teaching, and I dare not fail to encourage its completion for the sake of its beauty.\n\nStudents of the Dao may use this to understand its standards, and those with noble aspirations may practice it to commune with the divine.\n\nThis is indeed a grand event for the Daoist lineage—who could not rejoice in it?\n\nIn the mid-autumn of the *Yuan Zheng* year, Master Han Hongcheng, the Senior Lecturer of Ren’an Observance and the Great Master of Proliferating the Dao and Awakening to Truth, respectfully composed this preface.\n\n**Essential for the Daoist Comprehensive Teachings Collection (通教集):**\nAt the outset of seeking the Dao, one must first seek its standards. Those who take vows must possess the complete scriptures and precepts.\n\nFrom the Han dynasty to the present, all who upheld the lineage and established teachings followed the Celestial Master’s model, and their practices can serve as exemplary standards. Thus, the first section is established as *Standards of the Celestial Master*:\n\n- *Scriptures and Precepts of the Celestial Master’s Ascetic Life*\n- *Brief Biographies of Successive Masters*\n\nFor novices entering the Dao, the hymns of response must come first, from the *Opening Hall* to the *Farewell to the Sage*, all can be praised and recorded in the ritual scriptures.\n\nAt the beginning of initiation, one may lack a good edition, hence the second section is established as *Verbal Praises*:\n\n- *Words of the Step-into-Void Rite and Praises*\n- *True-Writing Talismans for Invoking All Kinds of Perfected Ones*\n- *True-Writing Talismans for Disaster Dispersion in the Five Directions*\n- *Twelve Vows of Mindful Retention*\n\n---\n\n「As the child grows into maturity, instruction in phonetics and metrics follows, with single-tone recitation and chanting to assist in ritual practice. Yet errors in transmission and repetition may lead to crude and unrefined imitation—all such flaws must be corrected to achieve precision and solemnity. Thus, the third section is established as *Chants and Praises*:\n\n- *Five-Directional Protective Spirits' Incantations*\n- *Chapter on the Five Kalpas of the Living Corpse*\n- *Outer Altar Chants and Praises*\n- *Legal Bridge Texts*\n- *Two Chapters for the Departed to Take Refuge in the Triple Gem and Repent Sins*\n- *Comforting the Departed and Offering Farewell Texts»\n\nIn the fourth section, the *Step-into-Void* (originally), the current edition removes the *Step-into-Void* and refines the *Teachings, Invocations, and Petitions* section. Included are:\n\n- *Petitions and Declarations to the Celestial Official*\n- *Incense Offerings at the Imperial Desk*\n- *Post-Incense Mindful Entry*\n- *Declarations to the Altar*\n- *Texts for the Yellow Arrow Rite After Incense Offerings*\n- *Five Masters' Host Petitions*\n- *Establishing the Altar and Igniting the Furnace*\n- *Petitions Before the Five Masters at the Rite’s Commencement*\n- *Yellow Arrow Rite’s Three Times National Petition to the Master*\n- *Original Commandment Scripture*\n- *True Martial Scripture*\n- *Peaceful Abode Scripture*\n- *Crown Talisman’s Commencement, Necessarily Requires Praise and Assistance*\n\nInner and outer ritual affairs are not confined to a single path—some texts may be incomplete, and some originals may contain errors. For beginners, caution is advised, selecting the best and following it. Thus, the fifth section is established as *Assistants and Praises*:\n\n- *Three-Day Lamentation Scripture*\n- *Yellow Arrow Rite Petitions and Repentance for Dispersal*\n\n**Dispersing Calamities and Illuminating True Repentance**\n- *Opening the Five Directions Scripture*\n- *Threefold Invitation Scripture*\n\n**Ritual of Blessing Food and Bathing Ceremony**\n- *The Office of Elevation and Display*\n  - *Division of Ceremonial Authority*\n  - *Rhythm and Meter, Detailed and Refined*\n  - *Harmony and Eloquence, Exemplified by Guangcheng’s Writings*\n  - *Established as a Special Discipline*\n  - *Requiring the Right Person to Move the Assembly*\n  - *Thus, the Sixth Section is Established as the **Praise and Guidance Chapter***\n    - *Du Tian Shi’s Preface to the Daoist Praise and Ceremony*\n    - *Ritual of Opening the Altar*\n    - *Ritual of Host Petitions*\n    - *Ritual of the Daoist Procession*\n    - *Various Repentance Rites and Their Methods*\n    - *Ritual of Turning the Sutra*\n    - *Ritual of the Fasting Hall*\n    - *Ritual of Offerings for Merit and Expiatory Rites*\n    - *Anciently Called \"威仪\" (Awe-Inspiring Ceremonies), Now Known as \"都讲\" (Grand Lectures)*\n    - *A Single Altar’s Rhythm Follows the Previous Section*\n    - *Imperial Edicts for Water Stewardship and Strict Adherence*\n    - *Opening the Sutra and Praise—All Are Critical*\n    - *Yet Many Errors Persist*\n    - *Thus, the Seventh Section is Established as the **Ceremonial Awe Chapter***\n      - *Imperial Edict for Altar Rituals*\n      - *Nine-Times Invitation of the Sutra*\n    - *The High Master’s Duties*\n      - *Daoist Virtue and Ceremonial Awe*\n      - *Summons and Solemn Reflection*\n      - *All Spirits Attend in Reverence*\n      - *Each Has Its Own Ritual Regulations*\n      - *Examined from Predecessors*\n      - *Compiled into One Section for Study*\n      - *Thus, the Eighth Section is Established as the **Precision Reflection Chapter***\n        - *Method of Issuing Imperial Edicts*\n        - *Announcing Matters and Explanations*\n\n**Elevation of the Platform and Ritual Announcements**\n- **Morning and Night Incantations at the Gates**\n- **Ritual for Honoring the Master and Cultivating Mindfulness**\n- **Announcement of the Law-Drum’s Sound**\n- **Method of the Void-Step Summoning Demons and Cultivating Mindfulness**\n- **Incantation for Reciting the Sutra and Quiet Contemplation**\n- **Opening the Sutra’s Essence: Four Incantations**\n- **Official’s Method of Precise Contemplation and Concentration**\n- **Proclamation and Recitation of the *Taiqing* Titles and Songs**\n- **Seal of the Seven Primordial Symbols and Their Announcements**\n- **Symbol of the Celestial Gate: Gathering and Dispersing Forms with Incantations**\n\nThe above eight sections are all drawn from Daoist scriptural canons and meticulously examined through the teachings of past masters and renowned scholars of recent times. Compiled into one volume, no presumption is made, lest later sages be misled. If kept as a private family secret, it would not be a universal doctrine. Therefore, it is engraved upon wood to share with fellow students, serving as an essential guide for transmitting the Dao and saving others.\n\nDo not lightly impart this to uninitiated laypersons, lest you invite regret. For if this collection is even slightly comprehensive, they may abandon their original path, devoting themselves to this instead—only to meet ruin later, inviting censure and blame.\n\nAs for the profound teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi, or the methods of Golden Elixir cultivation, those who follow the Dao must each have their share. This is not the Dao’s presence in the world, but rather the imperial institutional framework. The enlightened will surely recognize this truth.\n\nComposed in the late summer of the *Xinyou* year of the *Jiatai* era (1201) by the Daoist Lu Taigu of Hèlín Yuan, a native of Jiàn’ān.\n\n**Volume One of the *Daoist Universal Teachings Collection***\n**Lu Taigu’s *Hèlín Collection***\n**The *Jīnshì* Chapter**\n**The *Tàishàng Out-Home Sutra Instructions***\n\nThe *Sutra of the Causes and Conditions for Leaving Home* states: The Daoists have seven stages in total. The Celestial Venerable says:\n\n1. **Celestial Purity**—that is, the body harmonizes with Nature, and the inner and outer are perfectly tranquil.\n2. **Divine Immortals**—that is, transformations beyond measure, transcending the realm of the ordinary.\n3. **Secluded Elegance**—that is, containing light and hiding brilliance, unburdened by worldly entanglements.\n4. **Mountain Dwellers**—that is, secluded in study of the Dao, with wisdom and benevolence naturally at ease.\n5. **Those Who Leave Home**—that is, abandoning all attachments to the world, casting off the dust and clamor of mortal life.\n6. **Those Who Remain in the World**—that is, blending with the world’s light, embracing the Dao and nurturing virtue.\n7. **Sacrificial Attendants**—that is, humbling oneself among the vulgar, rescuing and delivering those in peril.\n\nThus, the term *Daoist* refers to one who, in all actions—moving, standing, sitting, or lying down—every thought and intention is devoted solely to cultivating the Dao and attending to virtue. They observe fasts and pay homage, chant scriptures and burn incense, uphold precepts and refine their conduct, light lamps for repentance, make offerings with sincere vows, expound the Great Vehicle, and guide all beings. They awaken the great mind of the Dao, create boundless merit, benefit all without distinction, and always place others before themselves, free from worldly toil. Their sole pursuit is the Dao’s work, and thus they are revered as the most exalted among the Six Paths and Fourfold Existence—both heavenly and earthly. They do not bow to the Son of Heaven nor salute the feudal lords, becoming fields of blessing for humankind and the refuge for the Three Realms.\n\nThe **Seventeen Vows of Daoist Aspiration for Leaving Home and Attaining the True Body**:\n1. I vow never to kill living beings, for it severs the sacred lineage.\n2. I vow forever to abstain from alcohol, for it corrupts pure nature.\n3. I vow forever to abstain from blood, for it defiles the body.\n4. I vow not to consume the five pungent herbs, for they obstruct the paths of Heaven and Earth.\n5. I vow not to indulge in lustful desires, for they disturb the mind.\n6. I vow not to speak of others’ faults, for it invites hatred.\n7. I vow not to covet wealth, for it hinders the Dao.\n8. I vow to diligently cultivate merit, for it adorns oneself.\n9. I vow not to disturb or anger others, for it breeds karmic enmity.\n10. I vow to benefit others without hesitation, for it is no different from benefiting myself.\n11. I vow forever to speak no falsehoods, for it makes others distrustful.\n12. I vow never to grow weary or negligent, for it dulls the resolve of the Dao.\n13. I vow to study all methods with effort, for it ripens the wisdom of the seed.\n14. I vow never to steal from others, for it demands double repayment.\n15. I vow to always observe inner fasting, for it attains pure harmony of mind.\n16. I vow to constantly reflect upon the emptiness and tranquility of all dharmas, for it swiftly advances the Dao.\n17. I vow to always be humble and silent as the foolish, for it ensures inner peace.\n\nAll the above vows are upheld by novices who enter the Dao.\n\nThe *Sutra of Ascending the Mysterious* states: The Daoist’s conduct is entirely opposite to that of the common person. Their eyes do not gaze excessively, nor are they startled by beauty. Their ears do not listen to slander nor to chaotic sounds. Their noses do not inhale fragrant scents, nor do they relish the pungent stench of decay. Their mouths do not crave sweetness, nor do they consume what violates all life. Their hearts do not dwell on desires, whether for wealth, sensual pleasures, or honor. Their hands do not act deceitfully, nor do their feet tread upon evil.\n\nThe *Sutra of Ascending the Mysterious* also states: All who leave home must discard ornamentation and fine attire, wearing only coarse cloth and simple garments, dwelling in lowly beds and modest huts—merely to sustain their bodies. They must not indulge in luxury. Except for treating illness or traveling, they may not seek permission to go outside. They must reside in clean, secluded places, indulging in the Dao’s subtle and boundless joys. This is called the **threshold of hearing the Dao** and the **foundation of great virtue**.\n\nThe *Sutra of Fixing the Will* states: In the past, there was a youth of twelve who lived in idle pleasure, preparing fine food together, drinking deeply and reveling in games. Sometimes they would debate whether the practice of the Dao and the upholding of precepts were difficult or easy. The Celestial Venerable, in great tranquility, perceived them and knew that in their previous lives, each had been a teacher to others, hoarding scriptures and grudgingly sharing them, causing their disciples to hesitate. Now, they had fallen into the dust of the world through this slight cause, yet still could be saved. The Celestial Venerable then transformed into a mortal man, passing through their gathering and overhearing their conversation. The man said: *\"Upholding precepts is very easy; not upholding them is far more difficult.\"* The youth, hearing this, asked in unison: *\"How so, sir? You say upholding precepts is easy, yet not upholding them is difficult?\"* The man replied: *\"Standing upright like a precept is easy—one need not fear the Son of Heaven nor the spirits and gods. But breaking a precept is difficult: such a person fears all mortals and fears the spirits and gods even more. How could it not be difficult?\"* Thus, the twelve youth, upon hearing the man’s words, all recalled their past lives, resolved to uphold precepts, and together attained the fruit of the Dao.\n\nThe *Sutra of the Dharma Wheel* states: The Celestial Venerable of Oneness and Mystery instructed Ge Xian Gong, saying: *\"In my past, I received my teacher’s instruction with utmost severity. The lessons cut deep as a knife, stung like a poisoned thorn. I bowed and knelt in service, never daring to slacken, never daring to refuse the pain or speak of the poison. Now that I have attained the fruit of the Dao, I cannot repay my teacher’s kindness.\"*\n\nThe *Great True Precepts* state: Daoists must first master the **Five Thousand Characters** of scriptural study. They must expound and comprehend the teachings, guide others, and benefit themselves, opening boundless enlightenment. This is the mark of the **Great Vehicle Practitioner**.\n\nThe *Great True Precepts* also state: At the dawn of creation, the **Sage-True Immortals** all proclaimed the Dao’s *qi* and established laws, passing them down through generations. They shared the same lineage as the Celestial Venerable, all called **Learned Masters**. Their work was the Dao, and their devotion to the Dao bore fruit, earning them the title of *Daoist*.\n\nThe *Sutra of Illuminating the Threat* states: **Study must never be superficial**, for false and true teachings may appear similar. One must not fail to discern them, for failure leads to perilous paths, while clarity grants ease. The difference between clarity and obscurity lies in the mind’s careful examination. The method of discernment is to **pervasively study all scriptures**, test them through experience, and verify their truth. Thus, one naturally attains luminous understanding—whether of worldly or transcendent laws, of actions with or without purpose. One will naturally fathom the subtleties of the **Three Pure Ones**.\n\n**Brief Transmission of the Lineage Across Generations**:\nThe Daoist teachings are ancient. **Huangdi and Laozi** championed the Way of **Purity and Stillness**. The disciples **Yin Ling, Zhang Tao, Lie Yukou, and Zhuangzi** expanded upon it, and the tradition flowed down to **Le Su Gong**. Gong taught **Ge Xian Gong**, and Ge Xian Gong taught **Cao Can**.\n\nThe efficacy of these words in governing the world is as described—how much more so the Dao of **Huang-Lao**!\n\nAlas, the world now indulges in extravagance and excess, and thus this Way grows hidden. The study of **immortality and transcendence** flourishes, and rites of supplication and sacrifice thrive. From the Eastern Han onward, until the beginning of the **Sui Dynasty**, **Pengqiuzi Jia Shanheng** and over a hundred others proclaimed this Way to the world, compiling *The High Dao Transmission*. From these, I have selected the most distinguished ten or so, distilling their essence and appending them to the scriptural teachings, so that my disciples may know whom to emulate and revere.\n\n**Zhang Tian师**\nTian师 bore the surname Zhang, given name **Dao Ling**, and courtesy name **Fu Han**. By nature, he was silent and revered antiquity, mastering both scriptures and histories while also excelling in **celestial omens and divination**. He relieved the urgent needs of others without distinction of familiarity or distance, and thus the world esteemed him, drawing many to his discipleship. When the **Emperor Zhang** summoned him, he declined, sighing as he parted from his disciples—only **Wang Chang** remained to attend him. He then retreated to **Qian** and **Heng**, reaching **Zhongyue Mountain**, where he obtained the **Nine Elixir Scriptures**. Upon refining the elixir, he told Chang: *\"I have yet to fulfill a great deed—how dare I hastily consume it? I must first benefit the state and family, eliminating harm and promoting good, before I may act lightly.\"* Thus, he moved the **Celestial Sovereign** to descend, granting him the **All-One Alliance and Awe** methods, subduing the **hosts of demons and jade maidens**, and establishing **twenty-four administrative precincts**. He taught people to confess sins and apportion blessings, instituting systematic precepts. The people of Shu were transformed, abandoning vice and fleeing crime. Later, upon **Yuntai Peak**, the Celestial Sovereign dispatched a **cloud-chariot** to descend and welcome him, and he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\n**Ge Xian Gong**\nXian Gong bore the surname Ge, given name **Xuan**, and courtesy name **Xiao Xian**. From his youth, he loved learning, mastering all **scriptures, histories, and classics**, and his fame spread across the **Jiangzuo region**. He often played the zither and recited **Zhuangzi and Laozi**, content and serene, needing nothing within. He then entered **Chicheng Mountain** to cultivate the Dao, later wandering through **Kuaiyang, Luofulou, Jinjing, Hezao, Yushi, and Tiantai Mountains**, refining his practice and recitations. Thus, he was visited by the **Three Pure Ones of the Supreme Polarity**, who bestowed upon him the **Three Cavern Treasure Scriptures**. At eighteen, he achieved Dao-completion, his transformations beyond measure. He compiled the essentials of the Three Caverns into the *Nine Abyssal Confessions* and authored over ten volumes on **Laozi and other scriptures**. One day, he told his disciples **Zheng Siyuan** and others: *\"The Wu ruler detains me, preventing me from reciting the Cavern Scriptures. I must first achieve **corpse dissolution**, then ascend to heaven.\"* When the time came, his body softened like silk, filling the room with fragrant qi. By the fifth day, a great wind arose, extinguishing all lamps. When the fire was lit, his corpse had vanished.\n\n**Wang Zuan**\nThe Daoist **Wang Zuan** resided on **Maji Mountain**, often performing **meritorious deeds in secret** to save others. During the late **Western Jin**, as the Central Plains fell into chaos, famine, pestilence, and disease ravaged the people, many perishing without relief. Moved by pity, Zuan composed a **petition in seclusion**, weeping profusely. After three nights, light filled his chamber as at noon. Soon, auspicious winds and clouds gathered in the sky, strange fragrances and celestial music descended to his courtyard, accompanied by **banners and flags**, **green boys and jade maidens**, and **dragons and tigers** as guards. Suddenly, the sounds of **mouth organs and flutes** came from the northwest. Amidst five-colored light, a **celestial official** announced to Zuan: *\"The Dao Sovereign of the Celestial Sovereign arrives.\"* A **treasure-seat** then descended from the sky, and the Dao Sovereign took his place. Zuan knelt and prostrated himself before him. The Dao Sovereign said: *\"You pitied the living, your petition sincere, your heart laid bare—this moved both the seen and unseen. The earthly officials have reported you, and I have come to observe.\"* The Dao Sovereign then expounded on **the cycles of yin and yang**, the **ascents and descents of humans and spirits**, the **Six Heavens’ demons and fallen generals**, who preyed on the weak, seizing opportunities to harm the living. *\"I have subdued them with solar might and divine incantations, and their chaos has naturally ceased.\"* He then commanded his attendants to grant Zuan the **Scriptures of Divine Transformation and Divine Incantations**, along with the **Three-Five Fast Precepts**, saying: *\"Diligently practice these—true stages may yet be attained.\"* As Zuan traveled through **Jiangbiao**, the plagues ceased.\n\n**Lu Tian师**\nLu **Xiujing**, courtesy name **Yuande**,\n\nThe Dao Sovereign said: *\"Your steadfast devotion to tombs and classics, your wide exploration of symbols and celestial omens—this is admirable. Yet you sighed, declaring: 'I wish to refine my form and merge with the Dao, to attain harmony with Heaven and complete my destiny, but this is not what you mean.' Thus, you devoted yourself exclusively to Daoist teachings, never ceasing in your studies, even in sleep. When you heard of a master of strange arts, though distant, you would seek them out. Dwelling in the rugged peaks of Jing, the people of Jiang and Han would come to listen, arriving empty-handed but returning with true understanding.\n\nBy the end of the Song dynasty’s **Yuanjia** era, Emperor Wen could not summon you. But when Emperor Ming ascended, desiring to bring **purity and stillness** to guide the people toward simplicity and sincerity, he deeply admired you. Thus, he repeatedly invited you, and you finally accepted the imperial command to descend from the mountains. Bears, tigers, monkeys, and birds lamented along the road, their sorrowful cries echoing—such was your influence on all things.\n\nUpon reaching the capital, you were lodged in a guesthouse outside the palace gates, allowing both officials and commoners to receive instruction from you. You then clarified the distinctions between **heresy and orthodoxy**, examining and verifying the authenticity of teachings. From this, the corrupt customs of the age transformed in unison. You once blended the **Three Caverns’ scriptures and methods**, but later corrected and refined them.\n\nYou also composed **rituals for fasting and purification**, establishing them as enduring precepts for future generations. Your friendship with **Tao Yuanming**, a fellow **outsider to formal ranks**, reveals much of your character.\n\nIn the fifth year of **Yuanhui**, on the first month, you suddenly told your disciples: 'I am pressed by imperial favor, forced to abandon my lifelong resolve. Now I shall return to my old mountain retreat.' Your disciples were astonished. On the second day of the third month, you quietly ascended, your skin radiant and luminous, a fragrant scent lingering in the air. Three days later, your disciples on Lushan saw a carriage adorned with **rainbow-colored banners**, and in an instant, you vanished, returning to your former abode.\n\nThe emperor posthumously conferred the title **Simple and Tranquil Master** upon you.\n\n**Kao Tian师**\n**Kao Qianzhi**, courtesy name **Fuzhen**,\n\nAt eighteen, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to the Dao, his spirit subtly attuned to the **Supreme Mysteries**. There was a **Celestial Master**, Cheng Gongxing, who took him as a servant in his household. One day, as Kao Qianzhi calculated the **cosmic resonances** of the **Five Phases** and **Six Qi**, he found the **Celestial Patterns** misaligned. Gongxing instructed him, and with a single adjustment, it was perfected. After some time, Gongxing said to him: *\"The Daoist Master has the will to cultivate the Way—perhaps you and I may withdraw together.\"* He then took him to **Hua Mountain**, where they gathered herbs for sustenance. From that point on, Qianzhi never again felt hunger. One day, he said: *\"I shall depart, but someone will bring you medicine.\"* He ate it, and indeed, it was as he had spoken. Upon examining the herbs, they were foul and venomous—poisonous creatures and noxious substances. He grew fearful and left. Gongxing returned and explained, sighing: *\"The Daoist Master is not yet ready for transcendence, but he may become a teacher for kings.\"* He added: *\"I shall depart tomorrow.\"* True to his word, he ascended at the appointed time. Qianzhi then settled in **Songyang**, never emerging again.\n\nIn the second year of **Shenrui**, on the first day of the fourth month, two men suddenly arrived, riding dragons and bearing **auspicious banners**, declaring: *\"The **Celestial Worthy** has come.\"* In an instant, the **Most High** descended in a **Nine-Dragon Jade Chariot**, surrounded by divine attendants, gathering atop the mountain. Qianzhi bowed in reverent devotion. The **Most High** commanded **Wang Fangping** to bring Qianzhi forward, saying: *\"I have received the **Celestial Register of the Central Peak’s Gathering of Immortals**, which states that since **Zhang Daoling** attained **True Perfection**, those who cultivate the Way have lacked a true teacher. Now there is the **Daoist of the Central Peak, Kao Qianzhi**, whose conduct aligns with **Natural Principle**. He should be placed in the **Master’s rank**, and thus I entrust you with the **Celestial Master’s mission**, along with the **Cloud-Middle Chanting**—the **Precious Scripture of the **Harmonious Precepts** and the **Newly Codified **Void-Wandering** Rituals**. You must proclaim them, assist the empire, and transform the people.\"* After Qianzhi accepted, the **Five-Cloud Platform Hall** vanished. From then on, his resolve and conduct grew ever more refined.\n\nDuring the **Shiji** era, the imperial court sent officials to summon him to the capital. **Sima Chengzhi**, the **Grand Tutor**, became his disciple, and the emperor himself knelt before him, asking questions with the utmost reverence. A **Celestial Altar** was erected in his honor, and thus the entire realm turned to him in veneration. The **Celestial Master** once performed rites at the **Central Peak** for the emperor’s blessings, and through his profound sincerity, the **Most High** secretly bestowed upon the emperor the title **Emperor of True Peace**. That year, the era was renamed **True Peace, First Year**.\n\nBy the ninth year, he told his disciples: *\"I dreamed of Cheng Gongxing, who summoned me to the **Celestial Palace of the Central Peak**.\"* In the fifth month, he **ascended in spirit**, with a **green vapor** like mist emanating from his mouth, rising to the heavens before dissipating. His body gradually shrank, and those who understood it called it **corpse dissolution**. He lived to eighty-four. Later, **Shen You** saw him atop the **Central Peak**, his body radiant silver, shining like the sun—thus proving him to be an **Immortal**.\n\n---\n\n**Celestial Master Wang Daoyi**\nWang Daoyi, a **Daoist** of the **Wei Dynasty**, was well-versed in all scriptures and mastered the **divinatory classics**. Learning of the **Empress Yin’s retreat** at **Zhongnan**, he came with six or seven disciples to dwell there, joining **Daoist Yin Lingjian** and forty others in spreading the **Great Dao’s transformation**. Though times were famine-stricken and provisions scarce, Daoyi expanded the **observatory halls** with hundreds of artisans, yet expenses never faltered. All knew it was due to the **Master’s divine influence**, as if secretly aided by the **Celestial**. Thus, every **pavilion and hall** was renewed.\n\nHe ordered his disciples to gather **True Scriptures**, amassing over ten thousand volumes—all through his own efforts, never seeking aid from others. His nature was boundless and unencumbered; even in his inner chambers, those who eavesdropped on his disciples found only **gathered Immortals** in speech. During the **Yongping** era, as he was about to **ascend**, white clouds and strange fragrances filled the room, lingering for days. A villager returning from afar saw Daoyi depart riding a **deer**.\n\n---\n\n**Master of Rectification, Sima Chengzhen**\nSima Chengzhen, courtesy name **Zimwei**, served **Pan Shizheng** and mastered the **Alchemy of the Form**. His teacher, recognizing his extraordinary nature, fully transmitted the **Dao of Tao Yuanming’s Rectification**. After some time, he declined and wandered the sacred peaks. Arriving at **Tiantai**, he built a **multi-tiered pavilion** on the altar, naming it the **Pavilion of Universal Marvels**.\n\nThe **Empress Wu** summoned him, but he soon departed. He was counted among the **Ten Friends of the Daoist Sect**, alongside **Chen Zhi’ang, Lu Zangyong, Song Zhiwen, Wang Shi, Bi Gou, Li Bai, Meng Haoran, Wang Wei, and He Zhizhang**.\n\nThe **Emperor Ruizong** summoned him again, commanding his brother **Sima Chengyi** to deliver the imperial edict, insisting he come. Upon arrival, he was led into the **inner palace**, where the emperor questioned him on his arts. The Master replied: *\"Cultivating the Dao is daily subtraction, until one reaches **non-being**—what the vulgar eyes and ears perceive. Each subtraction is already difficult; how much more so to attack heterodoxies and inflate one’s cleverness?\"*\n\nThe emperor asked: *\"This applies to refining one’s self, but how does it govern the realm?\"*\nThe Master answered: *\"The realm is but an extension of the self. Thus, one must **harmonize the mind with stillness**, **blend the qi with emptiness**, let **things follow their nature**, and abandon all **private scheming**—then the realm will be governed.\"*\n\nThe emperor sighed: *\"The words of **Broad-Nurturing Child**!\"*\nHe then requested permission to return to the mountains, receiving a **jewel-veined lute** and a **cloud-patterned robe** as gifts. The emperor ordered officials to compose poems in farewell.\n\nThe **Emperor Xuanzong** decreed the construction of **altars and chambers** on **Wangwu Mountain** for his residence. At that time, **Jiao Jingzhen**, a **Female Immortal** of the **Mohe**, sailed to **Penglai** in search of a teacher. Upon reaching a mountain, she was told by a **Daoist** that *\"Sima Zimwei of Tiantai Mountain is renowned in the **Jade Hall**, dwelling in **Chicheng**—he is truly a noble teacher.\"* Jingzhen returned to receive the Dao from the Master and soon ascended.\n\nOnce, descending to speak with **Xue Jichang**, he said: *\"The Master has attained the Dao higher than **Tao Dunshui**; he shall become the **Eastern Heaven’s Pure and Clear True Person**.\"* One day, the Master suddenly told his **grass-clad disciples**: *\"From the **Jade Mist Peak’s east**, I see **Penglai’s** Immortals descending. Now the **Eastern Heaven’s Green Boy Lord** summons me—I must go.\"* In an instant, he ascended.\n\nThe emperor posthumously honored him as **Silver Green Light-Lucre Grand Official**, with the posthumous title **Master of Rectification**. The emperor himself inscribed his stele.\n\nAmong his works, the *Secrets of True Cultivation*, *Diagram of the Celestial Treasury*, *Treatise on Sitting-Forgetting*, and *System of Ascension* circulate in the world.\n\nLi Han Guang\nThe Daoist Li Han Guang, at the age of thirteen, was deeply devoted to Daoist learning. Though in seclusion, he conducted himself as if before sovereign and father. Skilled in seal and clerical scripts, men praised him as surpassing his own father. Once he heard the Dao, he never again engaged in worldly affairs.\n\nHis master, Master Sima Zhengyi, upon seeing him, declared: *\"He is indeed a guest of the True Celestial Purity.\"* He admonished him: *\"Hold fast to emptiness, accumulate no attachments, and your Way shall know no end. Entrust yourself to the hidden peaks and efface your traces—your virtue is profound.\"* Thus, he entrusted him with all his sacred texts, bidding him first save others.\n\nHan Guang, having received this teaching, forgot himself in the Dao and aided others in their needs. Whenever he conducted rituals, he purified his heart and body without slacking. The Tang Emperor Minghuang summoned him to inquire about his practices, and he replied: *\"The Dao De Jing is the sovereign’s teacher. When the Han Emperor Wen practiced it, he elevated the people to benevolent longevity.\"*\n\nThe emperor further asked about the Golden Cauldron, and he answered: *\"The Dao and its virtue are public. Lightness of action is private within the public—if one seeks life while indulging desires, it is like harnessing the wind; how difficult!\"*\n\nThe emperor praised him and treated him with great honor. Soon after, Han Guang requested to return to Jùqū. The emperor established the Zǐyáng Observatory for his residence.\n\nWhen the emperor received the *True Scripture of Blessings and Auspiciousness*, he again requested Han Guang as his teacher, but he declined, offering his refusal from the Dàtóng Hall. The emperor posthumously honored him as **Master Xuánjìng**, and his works *The Transmission of Immortal Learning* and *On the Differences and Similarities of the Celestial Mysteries* circulate in the world.\n\nAt eighty-seven, he told his disciples: *\"I shall go to Mount Mao.\"* He then ascended in due time, with auspicious clouds descending and elixir grasses sprouting. His rank was that of an Immortal Official of Mount Mao.\n\nWu Zongyuan\nWu Jun, styled **Zhēnjié**,\n\n「Mastered the *Classics of Dao* and refined eloquent prose. Though he failed to pass the *Jìnshì* examinations, he departed to dwell at Yǐdì Mountain. In the early years of *Tiānbǎo*, he was summoned to the capital, where he petitioned to be enrolled among the *Daoists*, studying under Master Pàn Shīzhèng. He journeyed south to *Tiāntái*, gazed upon the *Cānghǎi*, and consorted with eminent scholars, whose literary works spread back to the capital.\n\nEmperor *Mínghuáng* summoned him and conversed with great delight, commanding him to serve as a *Hànlín* scribe and presenting him with three essays on the *Xuángāng*. The emperor inquired about the Dao, and he replied: *\"None surpass Laozi in profound understanding of the Dao; Your Majesty may seek it within the *Wǔqiān Wén*.\"* When further questioned about the arts of *shénxiān* (immortals) and alchemical cultivation, he answered: *\"This is the concern of rustics, not of a sovereign—it is unwise for rulers to dwell upon such matters.\"*\n\nYet whenever he spoke, his discourse centered on *orthodox teachings* and worldly affairs, employing subtle language to admonish and advise. The emperor held him in high regard. The *Sāmén* (Buddhist monks) resented his favor, and *Gāolìshì*, who had long served the *Fútóu* (Buddhist) sect, together defamed him before the emperor. He then requested to return to *Sōngshān*, and the emperor decreed the establishment of a pavilion for him.\n\nHe expounded on the *mysteries of the Grain Spirit* (*Gǔshén*), producing *The Treatise on the Xuángāng*. Mournful for the *blue-pine heart* and *withered gaze* of those distant from the Dao, he wrote *The Treatise on Immortality as a Learnable Art*. He composed *The Heart-Washing Ode* and *The Éxī Retreat Ode* to clarify the *transcendent purity* and *liberation from worldly entanglements*. His works on cultivating sincerity within the chest to rest in *Tianjūn* (Celestial Balance) include *The Theory of Heart and Mind* and *The Hymn of Divine Accord*. His poems on *wandering among immortals*, *treading the void*, and *mixed reflections on royal governance* total over four hundred and fifty, collected and prefaced by *Guān Déyǔ*.\n\nLater, he attained *spiritual dissolution*, and the emperor posthumously honored him as **Master Zōngyuán**. His works were compiled by **Liú Zhīgǔ**, styled **Xiānxián** (Celestial Hidden), a native of *Pèi*. A descendant of the *Zhèng King of Zhōngshān*, his ancestors served as officials in *Línqióng*, and the family settled there. His mother, of the *Hào* clan, conceived him after a divine dream, and she was endowed with wisdom and virtue, taking no delight in worldly gain or fame. She devoted herself solely to the Dao, later joining the *Tàiqīng Guān* (Great Clarity Monastery) and receiving the *sāndòng jīnglù* (triple cave scriptures and talismans).\n\nShe mastered the *Bāgōng Bǎozhāng* (Eight Immortals’ Precious Scriptures), the *sāndòng bǎolù* (triple cave talismans), the *Dānjīng Màijué* (Alchemical Canon of Veins and Pulse), and the *shēngshēng rùsǐ* (methods of birth-and-death transcendence), all without exception. The *Ruìzōng* emperor summoned him for inquiry, and his Daoist attainments pleased the sovereign, who bestowed special honors upon him before he returned to his mountain.\n\nDuring the *Kāiyuán* era, he was summoned again to alleviate the people’s suffering. As a *Zhēnrén* (True Person), he observed the *yùsè* (color of the complexion) and *dàimài* (pulse), dispersing *qì* to remove ailments. Eighteen out of every ten people benefited and found peace. The emperor’s gifts he declined, instead requesting permission to return to *Shù* (Sichuan), and he was granted a decree to establish his residence as the *Dàqiānqiū Guān* (Great Thousand Autumns Monastery). The emperor inscribed the name himself, and **Lǐ Yōng** composed the stele.\n\nLater, during the *Tiāncháng Jié* (Heavenly Length Festival), the monastery was renamed *Tiāncháng Guān* (Heavenly Length Monastery), and further arrangements were made for its expansion. When visitors came, he imparted the *Huángbái shù* (elixir arts of gold and silver). Though their dwellings were grand and splendid, costing tens of thousands, he never relied on human labor to complete them.\n\nVisitors returned, and he was advised by divine figures to dwell at *Dōngyáng Fùniú Shān* (East Yang’s Hidden Cow Mountain). Upon arriving, he found an ancient monastery renovated and ready for residence. He practiced the *sānbēn jiǔdào* (three sprints, nine methods) for ten years. Suddenly, a radiance filled his chamber, and a single *dānzhī* (elixir grass) sprouted, striking the stone beneath it and producing a resonant metallic sound. In a dream, a divine person told him: *\"Beneath the dripping spring of the mountain behind lies a stone where a golden fish crosses it—you may ascend to heaven with this.\"*\n\nHe was instructed that only this grass striking the stone would summon the fish. Later, he sought it out, and when he struck the stone with the grass, a thunderous force shook the earth. The massive stone cracked open, revealing the golden fish, three *chǐ* in length, which then soared into the sky, surrounded by swirling clouds and mists. The True Person once prayed for his mother’s blessings, placing nine *yōnghuā dēng* (lanterns of the Nine Abysses) in the *Jīn lù bái jiǎn* (golden talismans and white tablets) style, which remains in use to this day. The benefits to the *yōumíng* (netherworld) are immeasurable.\n\nHe also authored *The Celestial Pivot of Sun and Moon* and *The Song of Pointing Out Errors*, which circulate in the world.\n\nIn the *Xuān Hé* era of the *Shèngsòng* (Revered Song), the monastery was renamed *Xiānyǐn Guān* (Hidden Immortal Monastery), located within the northern city walls of *Chéngdū*.\n\n**Fù Liànshī** (Fù Xiānzōng), styled **Xiānzōng** (Immortal Ancestor), was from *Cháng’ān*. His father, **Lún**, served as the magistrate of *Zīyáng*. **Xiānzōng** from a young age took delight in Daoist learning, thus secluding himself at *Zīyáng Shān* (Resource Yang Mountain). Soon after, a divine person revealed to him that *Yù’àn Shān* (Jade Button Mountain) was suitable for cultivation, so he constructed the *Qiānlíng Guān* (Thousand Autumns Monastery) and resided there for a decade.\n\nOne day, several divine figures appeared and said: *\"Master, this mountain is our deity. Since you have taken up residence here, we have not known a moment’s peace, let alone this place being a blessed domain. The *Pínggāng Shān* (Flat Ridge Mountain) to the west of the prefecture is where you should dwell.\"* Heeding their words, the mountain spirits served as his attendants, and he built an altar and chambers at the site.\n\nWhen Emperor *Mínghuáng* championed the Dao, he summoned **Xiānzōng** to the court. Passing through *Lìzhōu*’s *Jiúpóbó Jīn* (Orange-Bamboo Ferry of Lì Prefecture), water demons plagued the locals. **Xiānzōng** inscribed two stone tablets with talismans and cast them into the water, whereupon two massive fish stranded on the shallows, their bellies bearing the inscription: *\"Red carp, red carp, dwelling in river waters, not avoiding the Immortal Officials—your fate is sealed by justice.\"* The prefectural magistrate reported this, and the emperor decreed the establishment of a shrine for **Xiānzōng** at the ferry.\n\nUpon arriving in the capital, he was assigned to preside over a *jiào* (ritual) at the *Shàngqīng Gōng* (Upper Clarity Palace). The emperor personally attended the altar. When **Xiānzōng** arrived, he requested the presence of the *Qīngtóng Jūn* (Youth Lord of the East) and his officials and attendants. In an instant, celestial soldiers filled the eastern side of the altar, and the emperor was filled with fear.\n\nAfter the ritual concluded, he asked **Xiānzōng** how he had achieved such power. **Xiānzōng** replied: *\"My cultivation focuses solely on pacifying the people and benefiting all things. I maintain a tranquil and unadorned simplicity, clear as still water, undisturbed as a calm mind. Thus, I overcome myself.\"* The emperor was deeply moved and pleased.\n\nIn time, he requested to return to his mountain, and the emperor ordered the expansion of his monastery, personally inscribing the name and renaming it *Yìngzhēn Guān* (Responding to True). On the fourteenth day of the tenth month in the third year of *Qiányuán*, he suddenly heard a voice from the sky: *\"The Most High commands your return.\"* He bathed, ascended his platform, and attained *spiritual dissolution*. Some saw him in *Jiǎnzhōu*, riding a green donkey as he departed—this was surely an instance of *shījiě* (body dissolution).\n\n**Lǘqiū Xiānshēng** (Lǘqiū Fāngyuǎn), styled **Dàfāng** (Great Rectitude), was from *Yùn* (Yun). At sixteen, he mastered the *Classics and Histories*. At twenty-nine, he entered the Dao, studying under **Yóu Yuánzé**.\n\nThe Master of the Marsh said to him: *\"Have you not heard the Master Lao say, 'My greatest affliction is that I have a body'? Truly, the body arises from non-action (*wuwei*) and gives rise to action (*youwei*); now you return to the root, which is called non-action. Non-action means that when one speaks of 'non-being,' one attains emptiness (*kong*); when one speaks of 'being,' one meets obstruction (*zhe*). Grasping both being and non-being leads to stagnation (*zhi*). Only when you harmonize being and non-being, extinguishing all thought and resting in thoughtlessness (*wu xin*), will you approach the Dao. And indeed, the Master Shakyamuni (释氏) established this as the foundation of the Zen School (禅宗).*\n\nConfucius said: *\"The stillness that does not move—its measure is singularity (一).\"*\n\nThe Master Lao further asked: *\"What is that which, when faced, has no front, and when followed, has no back? What is this thing?\"*\n\nIf you can grasp this in silence, what more do you need to seek? Why must you dwell beneath the long pines of an empty mountain? What is lamentable is that your talent and capacity are sufficient to become a true exemplar for the Daoist School (*Zhenmen*).*\n\nFāngyuǎn received his teachings and departed, then further studied under **Liú Chǔjìng** and **Yè Zàngzī** for the Daoist initiation (*dàojì*). Admiring **Zhìchuān Zhēnbái** for his upright character, his reputation grew even greater.\n\nThe ruler of **Wúyuè** (Wu and Yue), **Qián Liú**, revered his purity and simplicity, visiting him at **Dàdí Dòng** (Great Filtration Cave) and constructing a dwelling for him to reside in.\n\nEmperor **Zhāozōng** repeatedly summoned him in edicts, but he did not attend. The emperor then granted him official robes, bestowing the titles *Miàohǔo Dàshī* (Master of Marvelous Being) and *Yuántóng Xiānshēng* (Master of Original Harmony). His disciples numbered over two hundred, but only a dozen or so truly grasped the essence of cultivating *virtue/power* (*xiūzhēn*) and refining the *qi/spirit* (*liànshén*). Later, one day, he suddenly bathed, sat upright, and attained *spiritual dissolution* (*shījiě*). When his coffin was opened, only an empty casket remained.\n\n**Dù Guāngtíng**, styled **Bīnshèng**, the Daoist Master of the Dù lineage.\n\nFor his time, he was a renowned Confucian scholar, yet failing the *million-word essay* examination, he turned to the Dao/Way, becoming a foremost disciple of **Yìng Shì** (Responding Master). He once remarked that the Daoist teachings and rituals, since compiled by **Hàn Tiānshī** (Han Heavenly Master) and **Lù Xiūjìng** (Lu Modesty of the Pure), had over time fallen into disuse and decay. Thus, he scrutinized their authenticity, systematically recording their origins, and so the Daoist clergy across the land followed his arrangements to this day.\n\nEmperor **Lǐzōng** summoned him to serve as a literary draftsman in **Lín Dé Diàn** (Lynx Virtue Hall). At the time, he was praised as saying:\n*\"A forest of words, a sea of learning;\nUpholding the lineage, establishing the teaching—\nthe foremost under heaven.\"*\n\nDuring the **Zhōnglǐ** era, he accompanied the imperial procession to Shu, where he grew old in **Chéngdū**. When **Wáng Jiàn** ruled Shu, he summoned him as a teacher for the royal prince. He once told **Xú Guāngbù** (Xu Broad Virtue), *\"In my youth, I studied at the imperial university, where all texts were available. Within a month, I divided each day’s study:\nThe first day, I recited the Classics;\nThe second, I read the histories and commentaries;\nThe third, I practiced composition;\nThe fourth, I recorded anecdotes;\nThe fifth, I rested leisurely to cultivate my will.\nThis cycle completed in five days, repeated monthly.\nIn less than five years, I mastered all the texts.\"*\n\n**Guāngbù**, the Shù chancellor, had once been his disciple.\n\nThe Heavenly Master first encountered the **Chén Tǐ** (Body of Truth) scripture and later obtained divine elixirs. In **Chéngdū**, he resided at **Zhū Xiān Yīn** (Jade Immortal’s Retreat), where his teachings resonated widely. In autumn, he declined further invitations and never met again. One day, he suddenly told his disciples, *\"Last night, I dreamed of presenting myself to the Celestial Sovereign as the overseer of Mín Yuè (the sacred peaks).\"* At that time, the **True Palace** was being constructed on **Qīngchéng Shān** (Green City Mountain), and its completion was announced. He then donned his ritual robes, performed farewell rites, and ascended the hall, bidding his disciples farewell before attaining *spiritual dissolution* (*huà*). His remains were buried on **Qīngchéng**, but his coffin was found unusually light—upon opening it, only a single sandal remained.\n\nHe authored numerous works, including the *Hùnyuán Tú* (Mixed Primordial Diagram), *Yìjì Shèngfù* (Sacred Ode of the Epoch), *Guǎngshèng Yì* (Expanded Sacred Meaning), *Lìdì Jì* (Record of the Imperial Lineage), *Língyàn Jì* (Record of Miraculous Verifications), *Kējiào Yífàn* (Ritual Standards of Teachings), *Zhāngcí Biǎoshì* (Models of Chapters and Proclamations), and hundreds of songs and miscellaneous writings, collectively titled *Guǎngchéng Jí* (Collection of Broad Achievement). He was posthumously honored as **Guǎngchéng Xiānshēng** (Master of Broad Achievement).\n\n**Sū Chéngyǐn** (Su Concealed Virtue)\nThe Daoist **Sū Chéngyǐn** resided at **Zhèn Yáng Lóngxīng Guàn** (Dragon’s Ascension Hall in Zhengyang), mastering the teachings of **Lǎozǐ** and **Zhuāngzǐ**, and excelling in *qi* cultivation and nourishment. In the **Kāibǎo** era (968 CE), Emperor **Tàizǔ** stationed in **Zhèn Yáng**, summoned him to the palace. The emperor said, *\"Master, you are over eighty yet appear youthful—this is the art of nurturing life. Please instruct me.\"* **Chéngyǐn** replied, *\"My method of nurturing life is no more than refining thought and cultivating the spirit. For rulers, the path differs.\"* He cited **Lǎozǐ**:\n*\"If I act without action, the people transform themselves;\nIf I desire nothing, the people return to simplicity.\nWithout action, without desire—\nthe spirit merges with the Great Harmony.\"*\n\nThe emperor praised his words and bestowed extraordinary honors.\n\n**Zhāng Wúmèng** (Zhang Dreamless)\n**Zhāng Wúmèng**, styled **Língyǐn** (Hidden Forest), was renowned for his filial piety. He favored solitude, studied the *Yìjīng* (Changes Classic), and at adulthood, entrusted his wealth to his younger brother before entering **Huà Shān** (Flowery Mountain), where he befriended **Zhǒng Fàng** (Seed Release) and **Liú Hǎitán** (Liu Sea Pot), serving **Xīyí Shì** (Harmonious Master). He gained profound insights. Afterward, he wandered to **Tiāntái Shān** (Heavenly Terrace Mountain) and **Chìchéng** (Scarlet City), dwelling there for over a decade. His cultivation was refined, and he expressed his inner truths in poetry, composing *Hái Yuán Piān* (Hundred Verses of Returning to the Primordial) with a hundred stanzas. **Xià Yīnggōng** (Summer Noble Lord) visited him in the mountains, obtaining the poems to present at court. **Wáng Jìgōng** (Wang of Ji), as chancellor, received the poems and later submitted them to the throne.\n\nEmperor **Zhēnzōng** inquired about strategies for longevity. **Wúmèng** replied, *\"I am a rustic—only reciting the *Lǎozǐ* and *Zhōuyì* in the mountains.\"* The emperor commanded him to lecture on the *Yìjīng*, and he expounded on the **Jiǎn** (Modesty) hexagram. The emperor asked, *\"Why only the Modesty hexagram?\"* **Wúmèng** answered, *\"In times of great abundance, one must govern with modesty.\"* The emperor delighted in his words and offered him the post of **Zhuózhuò Zuǒláng** (Literary Draftsman), which he declined. Later, the emperor summoned him again to lecture on *Hái Yuán Piān*, offering wine and gifts, which he also refused. The emperor then bestowed the title **Chùshì Xiānshēng** (Recluse Master), which he declined as well. The emperor composed a poem in reply:\n\n*\"The Dao of Mixed Primordial contains pure essence,\nObserve it—no trace, listen—no sound.\nOnly the enlightened attain this truth,\nAdrift beyond the world, immersed in stillness.\n\nFloating clouds unfold beyond ordinary form,\nFlowing water circles without fixed shape.\nOn impulse, I left the mountain’s gate,\nTo discuss the Dao, I briefly visited the royal court.\nWith the wind, I heard the essence of the lineage,\nReturning to the stone, I sought my natural ease.\n\nJade and silk, cap and sash—unworthy of my regard,\nI sang long and now return with imperial favor.\nThe next day, I departed by decree,\nThe court ordered my stipend from Tàizhōu—\nI did not request it.\nThus, my life’s end was pure and untainted.\"*\n\nHe died at ninety-nine in **Jīnlíng**. Three days later, white *qi* emerged from his crown, rising three feet high. His *Jūn Tái Shī* (Jade Terrace Poems) circulated in the world. His disciple, **Bìxū Zǐ** (Azure Void Child) **Chén Jǐngyuán** (Chen Scenic Element), inherited the essence of **Lǎozǐ** and **Zhuāngzǐ**.\n\n**Liú Shì** (Master Liu)\n**Liú Cóngshàn**, styled **Shùnfū** (Obedient Husband), from a young age, favored Daoist learning. He took ordination at **Jiànlóng Guàn** (Observing Dragon Hall). In the early **Tiānshèng** era, he resided at **Jǐnglíng Gōng** (Scenic Spirit Palace) by imperial decree. The emperor and empress desired to receive Daoist initiation. **Shàoguān Miào Shì** (Mysterious Observation Master) **Zhū Zìyīng** (Zhu Self-Cultivation) established an altar at **Yùqīng Zhāoyìng Gōng** (Jade Purity Responsive Palace), commanding **Cóngshàn** to participate in the ritual. The emperor was strict in filial offerings, sending envoys to instruct him on the taboo dates of the late emperor, ordering him to recite incantations before the deities during the ritual meal.\n\nThus, **Cóngshàn** compiled the incantation formulas from the **Sāndòng Jīng** (Three Caverns Scriptures) and later submitted the ritual texts. The emperor praised him, bestowing the title **Quánsù** (Complete Purity), and ordered his compositions to be inscribed in all Daoist halls. The ritual of *zòushí* (ritual meal offerings) originated with him. When the **Yánníng Gōng** (Serene Peace Palace) was completed, many submitted poems for the imperial portrait’s five-viscera inscriptions, but only **Cóngshàn’s** met with approval. His text was engraved on gold and jade plaques.\n\nWhen Emperor **Rénzōng** fell ill, he summoned **Cóngshàn** to present petitions inside the palace, commanding officials to relay his words. After kneeling and presenting his memorial, the emperor asked, *\"Did your words reach me?\"* He replied, *\"They have reached you.\"*\n\nWhen the emperor’s passing was near, after but a few moments, he suddenly regained his vitality and clarity, and commanded that it be announced: *\"Ask the General Bo of what divine origin?\"*\n**Cóngshàn** replied: *\"Beneath the Three Heavens’ Gate stands a deity—the General Bo of Zhōngyuán, who governs the spirit of petitioning.\"*\n\nAgain, the proclamation came: *\"Set up his station.\"*\nThe next day, the imperial health fully recovered. He instructed his attendants: *\"Last night, I reached the Celestial Gate, where General Bo said, ‘The Emperor has not yet arrived; I must borrow a steed to return you swiftly.’ Thus, I awoke.\"*\n\nThe emperor removed his imperial robes, offering gold and silk in gratitude, and sought to bestow upon him the title of *xiānshēng* (Immortal Master). **Cóngshàn** declined with humility.\nIn the reign of Emperor **Yīngzōng**, the Chancellor **Hán Wèigōng** (Han of the Wei clan) again petitioned for the title to be granted, but he refused once more.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day of the seventh month of **Xīnníng the Third Year**, after bathing in purification, he gathered his disciples and declared: *\"I await the great wind’s arrival, then I shall depart.\"*\nSoon after, the wind arose as foretold, and he ascended in transformation.\n\nLater, a traveler returning from **Shǔ** (Sichuan) reported seeing the Master riding a white horse into the region, with the parting words: *\"If you encounter my disciples, convey this message to them.\"*\nThus, it was known that he had achieved *shījiě* (embodied ascension).\n\nHe compiled ritual fasting procedures, methods for petitioning the Dao, and left behind hymns and poems in circulation.\n\n---\n**Daoist Canon’s Universal Teachings (Required Texts, Volume I)**\nOriginal Title: *Lǚ Tàigǔ Ji* (Collected Works of Lü the

only to the Three Masters—*Scripture*, *Canon*, and *Transmission*—\nand threefold invocation is made.\nEven before the proper altar is established to honor the Master’s presence,\nit is the *self*-transmitted Three Masters of the Three Worlds.\nLater generations failed to examine this closely,\nmistaking the Three Masters for celestial Daoist officials,\nthus adding them to the Five Masters.\nSince this is now the case,\nit cannot be altered again—\nlet the Three Masters among the Five be honored as:\n*Yùluóqiào Zhēnrén* (Idyllicly Elevated True Person),\n*Zhēndìngguāng Zhēnrén* (True Person of Illuminating Stability),\nand *Guāngmiàoyīn Zhēnrén* (True Person of Resplendent Sound).\nThese are the Three Masters who witnessed the *Scripture* on Tiantai,\nthe ancestral teachers of transmission,\nnever forgetting their origins.\n\nAs for the *Sānián* (Three Sovereigns),\nthey are also called the Three Masters,\nalready revered in the proper altar rites—\nthey cannot be reduced to the Five Masters.\n\nIn the *Xuánzhōng* (Mysterious Central) hierarchy,\nthe first rank belongs to the Master,\nfollowed by the Three Masters,\nthen the *Jiānyàn* (Supervising Feast) Grandmasters.\n**For rites of fasting and Daoist practice:**\nInvite the *Xuánzhōng Dàfǎshī* (Grandmaster of the Mysterious Central) to descend and preside.\n**For rites of fasting and Daoist practice:**\nInvite the Three Masters—*Scripture*, *Canon*, and *Transmission*—to descend and preside.\n**For rites of fasting and Daoist practice:**\nInvite the *Jiānyàn Dàfǎshī* (Grandmaster Supervising the Feast) to descend and preside.\n\nWhen the *yún yǔ* (cloud chariot) has descended,\nand the *hè jià* (crane carriage) arrives,\nthe feast is complete in all its rounds—\nthen it is

spell is not originally compiled in the *Praise and Chant* section, yet many afflictions arise from hearsay and oral transmission, with numerous errors and distortions. Hence, it is recorded here, so that from childhood one may be instructed in it, and thus apply it throughout one’s life.\n\nMoreover, examining this spell, all its verses are texts to subdue evil (*制邪*), so each contains the character *wǒ* (我, \"I/we\"). Some mistakenly alter it to *chén* (臣, \"subject\"), which is incorrect.\n\nAfter reciting the spell, igniting the furnace, and focusing one’s mind (*存神*), then comes the moment of invoking the *Upper True* (上真) and sealing the decree. There is no taboo in this sequence; it follows the *Golden Talisman Rites* (*金箓仪*) and cross-references the *Dao藏* (*Dao Canon*) for verification.\n\n**East:**\nNine *Qi* of Azure Heaven, the Great Spirit of Bright Stars,\nIlluminating the Eastern Region, piercingly revealing the Nine Gates,\nTurning radiant the Yang Light, sweeping away filth and dissipating the *fēn* (氛, malevolent

Fire Soldiers, guarding the Three Palaces,\nbeheading evil and binding *yāo*, severing the *Mówáng* (魔王, \"Demon King\"),\nas decreed by the Northern Emperor.\nThis spell is entirely for subduing demons and spirits, preventing them from disturbing the *Dao*’s sacred grounds (*道场*).\n\nAll who practice the *Dao* must subdue the multitude of demons—all belong to the Northern Emperor.\nThe Northern Clouds are under the Northern Emperor’s jurisdiction; some mistakenly claim this is a Southern spell, altering it to be recited by the *Chìdì* (赤帝, \"Vermilion Lord\"), which is incorrect.\nThis confusion is harmful and must be clarified.\nThe Eight *Chōng* (冲, \"Assaults\") of Wind and Fire,\njingling bells in alternating brilliance—dare any resist?\nThe True *Dao* spreads, *I* reap the rewards, safeguarding Heaven’s eternal preservation,\nfor countless *jiè* (劫, eons), without end.\nThe phrase \"Severing the Demon King\" is derived from the *Dao藏*’s ritual procedures

demons,\nrepelling ten thousand ghosts—\nthe *Shāngshān* (中山, \"Central Peak\") Deity’s spell,\nuniversally compels all under Heaven,\nthe Five *Líng* (灵, \"Spirits\") are calmed,\nand my form ascends

evil.\nRefining and liberating the *Dānhuáng* (丹皇, \"Cinnabar Sovereign\") Palace,\nascending to the *Yuánshǐ* (元始, \"Primordial Origin\") clan.\n\nThe *Yánmíng* (炎明, \"Flame Clarity\") endures in perpetual radiance,\nthe *Língqìng* (灵庆, \"Spiritual Celebration\") follows the morning’s brilliance.\n\n**West:** The *Yánkāng* (延康, \"Prolonging Health\") *Sùlíng* (素灵, \"Pristine Spirit\") Seven

*Fánhùn* (梵混, \"Buddha-Blending\") *Qi* Treasure Talisman.\nThe Five *Qi* (气) correspond to the Original Marvel,\nthe Heavens blend with the Great Darkness.\n\nThe *Shénjīng* (神旌, \"Divine Standard\")

origins.\nThe Dao’s shores are high and difficult to ascend—\nwho will lend a hand?\nThrough the nature’s enlightenment and delusion,\none’s fate rises or falls between heaven and earth.\nAlas, these beings in the turbid world—\ntheir love flows like an ocean, their cruelty surges like waves,\nthe tides of greed and wrath churn violently,\nhabits accumulate like drops into torrents,\nchasing after objects, the dead fill the sight—\nall are self-inflicted.\nYet those who reach the shore are rare in the world.\nIs there no path to draw them out?\nTo rescue those drowning in suffering.\n\nOnly the *Tàishàng* (太上, \"Supreme Sovereign\") pities all beings drowning together,\nestablishing the wondrous Law as a bridge,\ncommanding the Ten Extremes’ Celestial Lords to be the sacred pillars of the Dao’s shore,\ninstructing the Five Spirits’ children to be the ferry across the Sea of Paths,\npulling the lost from their wanderings,\nleading them to the other shore.\nCrossing the Weak Waters—three million *lǐ*,\ntransmitting the *Tuánjiāng Fēng* (团刚风, \"Clustered-Firm Wind\") five hundred billion *zhòng*,\nwithout delay, ascending in a breath—\nimmediately reaching the realm of unbounded

departed onto the Law-Bridge.\n\n**Next Step**\n**Descending the Bridge Verse**\nThe Law-Bridge spans the Sea of Suffering as a crossing,\nthe *Tàishàng*’s compassionate vows are boundless.\nIn the raging waves, they encounter the *Dǐzhù* (砥柱, \"Pillar\"),\nat the love-river’s broken bank, they meet the immortal’s *Yīnyīn* (音雕, \"Echo-Carved\") sound.\nThe *Gōngzǐ Língwén* (公子灵旛, \"Noble Prince’s Spirit Banner\") dispels stagnation,\nthe Celestial Venerable extends a hand in mutual invitation.\nTaking up the martial arts, they descend the bridge toward the Jade Terrace,\nthe Great Talisman’s unfettered faith in unbounded ease.\n\n**For the Departed: Taking Refuge in the Three Jewels and Repenting Sins**\nThe departed’s offenses—having received the summons,\nthey arrive at the

they may not awaken to the True Words,\nreverently relying on the Three Jewels’ radiance,\nrepenting the Six Roots’ sins.\n\nFor sins arise from the heart—\nextinguishing the heart dissolves ten thousand faults;\nthe will finds peace in the Dao—\nseeing the Dao, the single spirit shines through.\nIt is fitting to purify emotions and thoughts,\ncleanse the nature’s purity,\nquickly abandon illusion to return to the True,\nthus hearing the scriptures and attaining the Dao.\n\nThose who perform meritorious deeds, establish vegetarian offerings,\nreceive talismans and precepts—\nfirst, they must take refuge in the Supreme, True, Ten-Directional Three Jewels,\nrelying on the Three Jewels’ holy power,\nrepenting the departed’s threefold karma and transgressions.\n\nThus the scripture says:\n*If one does not take refuge in the Three Jewels,\nthen all good deeds have no foundation to depend upon.*\n\nThe gathered assembly of the Dao-field,\nunited in sincere devotion.\n\n**Taking refuge in the Ten-Directional Dao Treasures,**\nwe prostrate to the Primordial Sovereign of Heaven, the Origin,\nwho can absolve the departed souls of their **body-karma sins**.\nWe repent the departed’s boundless **body-karma sins**—\ntheir countless transgressions too vast to measure.\nIn every movement, coming and going,\nthey were entangled in dust and defilement.\nAdorned with vanity, indulging in idle pleasures,\nthey scorned and mocked the people of the world.\n\nNow before the Great Compassionate Sage,\nwith one heart, we confess our sins.\nMay these **body-karma sins** be

obeisance, I take refuge in the Dao,\nthe Venerable Primordial Lord of Great Unity.\n\nIn the boundless void of ancestral kalpas,\nfrom the chaos of the primordial root,\nI pray You descend the

mercy,\nthrough kalpas, You guide the lost and the deluded.\nI pray You descend infinite teachings,\nto deliver this departed soul.\n\nI repent the sins of the departed’s eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind—\nthe six senses, six desires, and six afflictions.\nFlutes and strings resound with little true sound,\nwhile ears delight in purple and green hues, not pure colors.\n\nNoses compete in perfumes of orchids and musk,\ntongues revel in the clamor of chariots and horses.\nThe body indulges in spicy excess, harming the spirit,\nthe mouth speaks in unchecked wrath, only seizing others’ wealth.\nThe mind clings to the six senses’ sins—\neach sense draws the wheel of rebirth,\nor even the Three Paths of suffering—\nthis is an error.\n\nThe Three Treasures always open the gates of salvation.\nWith present sincerity, I confess past transgressions,\nand utterly wish for all sinful roots to be extinguished.\n\nNext, I repent the sins of greed, anger, delusion, and ignorance—\nof licentiousness, theft, killing, and falsehood.\nOf defaming the Scriptures and destroying the Teachings,\nnot taking refuge in the Dao.\nOf blaming the Way and faulting the Master,\nbreaking solemn vows.\nOf restless fantasies in body and mind,\nof senses ever stirred by greed.\nFrom past, present, and future lives,\nthe sins of the Three Worlds are immeasurable.\nToday, with heartfelt repentance, I confess,\nand pray that all past obstructions and afflictions be removed.\n\nHaving now confessed with words to the Dao’s presence,\nthe multitude of saints, seated in the void,\nwill

erased,\ntheir speech-karma sins be erased,\ntheir six senses be purified,\ntheir grudges be dissolved,\ntheir karmic obstructions be dissolved,\nall their sins be dissolved.\nMay the departed’s countless sins melt like frost and dew,\nunder the universal rays of grace.\n\nIn this life and the next,\ntheir inherent nature remains forever serene and tranquil.\nThe departed soul emerges from

Gathering*.\nThe Daoist communal teachings must employ the *Four Chapters of the Scripture of Gathering*.」\n\n「The Daoist Master Lü Taigu’s *Collection of Petitions*\n**Petitionary Verse**\nTo the Highest Functionary’s Imperial Desk—\nFragrant incense ascends, its prayers like jade flowers blooming,\nNine breaths of *qi* enfolded in mist,\nDense incense clouds weave through the heavens,\nDirectly piercing the Nine Celestial Realms.\n\nThe Golden Boy attends with incense,\nThe Jade Maiden relays the words,\nBefore the Celestial Sovereign,\nAll who hear my humble plea\nGrant their favor as I speak.\n\n**Hand-Held Incense Petition**\nThe Dao/Way arises from heart-mind study,\nMind transmitted through fragrant incense,\nHand clutching the jade burner,\nHeart set toward the Nine Celestial Heights.\n\nThe True Spirit descends in grace,\nDivine adornments attend the court,\nMy Lord commands me to proclaim—\nDirectly ascending to the Three Heavens.\n\n**Incense on the Alchemical Altar Petition**\nThe Crimson Sun soars through the Nine Exalted Realms,\nThe luminous essence of the Primordial Crystal refined.\nThe Spirit Phoenix comes to perch,\nAscending to the Celestial Court of Jade.\n\nKarmic bonds dissolve through transformation,\nThe Daoist Path achieves its triumph.\nMay this Alchemical Prayer,\nLike smoke, swiftly ascend.\n\n**Hand-Held Incense Petition**\nA hundred deities arrayed in ritual,\nMind focused on the Cavernous Sun.\nTo the left, the True Marshal commands,\nTo the right, the Primordial Sovereign draws near.\nUnfolding the Sacred Scroll,\nThe Great Brahman flourishes.\nPurple smoke ascends to the heights,\nTen thousand Dao/Paths expand in splendor.\n\n**Petitionary Verse for the Incense Offering**\nHumbly heard, the boundless realm of the **Great Clarity (Taiqing)**,*\nAcross lifetimes, mere dust;\nThe august, peerless **Supreme Venerable (Wushang)**,**\nEver distant, no trace among mortals.\nWith reverent fasting and purification,\nI now present my earnest supplication,\nHoping for a private descent of scrutiny,\nA slight display of the wondrous transformation of **sentient response (ganhua)**.\n\nGazing afar upon the Cloud Chariot,\nTemporarily departing the **Purple Expanse and Vermilion Gate’s** solemn grandeur,*\nAdorned with celestial crowns and stars,\nTogether revealing the **Jade Treasury and Pearl Banner’s** sacred mysteries.**\nWith utmost sincerity, I humbly pray—\nMay the Heavens accept my words, as spoken.\n\n**Altar Petitionary Text**\nHumbly heard, the lofty tiers of clouds,\nThe Heavens do not close the path of **sentient response (ganhua)** and communion;\nThe human Dao/Way is vast and distant,\nYet the Saints ever descend in private grace.\nWith solemn reverence in my home,\nI now devote myself to the **Pure and Exalted Rites (jingjiao)**.\nI present the humble offerings of earthly plants,\nI kindle the sacred incense to the heavens,\nDaring to reveal my simple thoughts,\nHumbly seeking the **Great Construction’s** divine favor.\n\nNow, with respectful devotion to the **Celestial Science (xianke)** of this year,\nI pray for the extension of the True Chariot,\nTruly marking the beginning of this **fasting assembly (jianzai)**,\nThe first expression of my sincere service to the **Celestial Sovereign (shidi)**.\n\nThough my offerings are meager,\nThe Dragon Chariot’s blessings I earnestly await.\nOnly this turbulent, defiled land,\nFearing to offend the Highest Clarity,\nGazing upon the **Buddha’s** fragmented form,\nIncreases my trembling awe.\n\nHumbly I hope for the Cloud Chariot and Crane Procession,\nDescending through the **Ninefold Celestial Gate (tiantian)**;\nVermilion banners and rainbow flags,\nHalting in the **Five Impurities of the Human Realm (wuzhu)**.\nThe **Three Realms of Jade Emptiness (Yuxu)**,**\nThe **Ten Thousand Spirits of the Golden Gate (wanzhu)**,\nTemporarily leaving the distant heavens,\nDescending to fulfill my devout and earnest prayers.\n\nI command the **Spirit Official of the Realm (Lingguan)**,\nTo solemnly oversee this **rite of purification (jiao)**.\nI decree the **Guardian Officers of the Altar (weitanjiangli)**,\nTo drive away all malevolent influences.\nMay my sincere intentions resonate in **sentient response (ganhua)**,\nAnd my fasting rites achieve their purpose,\nSo that I may immediately receive the **Highest Saint’s** descending grace.\n\n**The Petitioner’s Words**\nThe **Altar Petitionary Text** is thus universally employed.»\n\nThe Petitioner’s Humble Words\n\nI have heard that the **Supreme Immortal of Tranquil Stillness** acts without doing yet responds perfectly; the **Mysterious Void Dao** ever subtly communicates through attunement. Without sincere invocation of the **Numinous Methods**, how could one aspire to the **Sacred Workings**?\n\nNow that the **Sacred Altar** has been established and the **Rite of Purification** is about to commence, I first humbly pray to the **Celestial Spirit**, then unfold the **Dao’s Precepts**. May it penetrate the **Nine Heavens above**, so all may hear and know; may it illuminate the **Three Realms below**, so all may be moved and respond. May the **Supreme Virtue** be broadly bestowed, encompassing all sentient beings.\n\n**The Yellow Register Rite’s Sacred Petitionary Text**\nThe **Yellow Register Sacred Rite**, the **Purple Yang Secret Pattern**, above can **stabilize Heaven and pacify Earth**, below can **protect the nation and bring peace to the home**. It rescues the living and saves the dying, extends life and delivers from peril—held in reverence by the **Ten Thousand Heavens**, followed by the **Thousand Saints**. Its teachings unfold across the **Nine Periods**, drawing from the **Nine Yang Numbers**; its altar is structured in **Three Levels**, branching into the **Three Qi Blossoms**. It aligns the **Eight Trigrams** with the **Eight Directions**, fixes the **Ten Celestial Stems** in their **Ten Positions**. It opens the **Heaven Gate** and the **Earth Portal**, the **Ghostly Path** and the **Human Way**. The **bows and flags**, **mirrors and swords** are arrayed in solemn order; the **trays and vessels**, **earthen jars and gourds** are offered in humble simplicity. Thus does it **model Heaven and mirror Earth**, **communicate with the True and summon the Spirits**.\n\nWe, the petitioners, now begin our **first reverence**, our **initial homage**. Before the **Jade Stair’s** infinitesimal space, we dare not be disrespectful; beneath the **Celestial Countenance’s** near presence, we stand as if already above. We humbly pray that the **Three Pure Ones and Ten Extremes**, the **Ten Thousand Saints and Thousand Immortals**, temporarily leave the **Golden Gate’s** lofty heights, descending to survey the **dusty world’s** confined depths. May this humble abode become the **Pure Capital’s** celestial residence, awaiting Your gracious descent—our reverence and longing know no bounds.\n\n**The Petitioner’s Words on the Rite’s Sacred Petitionary Text**\nThus, when the altar is first opened, the **Heavenly Gates** stand wide, the assembly is solemn and silent, our hearts pure and sincere. We emulate Heaven’s grandeur and Earth’s humility, arranging the **Heavenly and Earthly** in order; we gaze left to the **Ceremonial Standards**, right to the **Jade Carvings**, the gates aligning with **Sun and Moon**. We focus our intent within the **elaborate scriptures and ritual systems**, attuning to the **dim, elusive** yet **manifest** Spirits. With **seven days of abstinence** and **three days of fasting**, we honor the ancients’ devotion to the **Celestial Sovereign**; with **inner resolve and outward sincerity**, we pledge today’s unyielding honesty. We open the **Treasure Altar of All Marvels**, fulfilling the **past year’s and present wishes**, inviting the **feathered sages** to chant the **Deep Chapters**. The **Celestial Procession** ascends with thunderous might, the **Sacred Waters** flow like clouds and rain.\n\nWe humbly pray to the **Star Palaces and Moon Halls**, the **Vermilion Gates and Pure Capitals**, the **Deepest Mysteries**, the **Saints of the Triple Profound**. From the **Heaven of Heavens**, descending from the **Symbol Beyond Symbols**, You traverse the void with flying steps—**Zhi-Tong children** bearing **feathered banners** lead the way; **dragon chariots** and **wind-riding steeds** bring You swiftly down. You deign to observe the **fragrant offerings**, to accept the **humblest sincerity**, bestowing blessings on the living and the dead, extending mercy to the hidden and the manifest. We have already received the **Highest Spirit’s** oversight—how could we forget the **Great Response’s** omen? We await Your descent with reverent longing.\n\n**The Petitioner’s Words on the Altar’s Sacred Petitionary Text**\nAll **Three Realms’ responsive Spirits**, all **True Essences**, may You hear our petitions and descend to the **fragrant altar**. Having bathed in Your radiance, we now humbly present our earnest prayers. We envision the **celestial melodies**, the **feathered retinues** standing in solemn ranks. The **wind-blown canopy** and **cloud-borne palanquin** drift near; the **rainbow banners** and **vermilion flags** appear and vanish. The **Supreme Truth** descends to this mortal realm—the **Purple Palace’s** and **Cinnabar Sky’s** processions arrive. You pause at the **changing world**, the **Jade Pool’s** and **Moon Gate’s** splendor, temporarily halting the **phoenix carriage** to survey our sincere hearts, revealing our hidden devotion, and ascending to the **Great Workings**.\n\nI have heard that the **Dao ever responds to humanity**, Heaven ever listens below. With our **sincere devotion**, how could we neglect the **solemn beginning**? We exhaust our **inner sincerity** and **outer offerings**—the altar follows the **law’s measurements**, the **earthen jars** prioritize **substance over ornament**. The **sacrificial tokens** are arranged, each symbolizing the **Five Directions’ colors**; the **headgear and robes** are arrayed, dividing the **multitude’s ranks**. The **Dragon-Torch** flickers in **divine light**, the **incense beasts** congeal in **auspicious mist**. The **willow branches** are purified, the **flower petals** scatter in profusion. When the **high and low** take their positions, it is the moment of **Heaven and humanity’s mutual response**—**Heaven’s威** is near, the **clouds** rest in serene stillness, the **Spirits descend**, demanding utmost solemnity.\n\nWe humbly pray that the **Celestial Countenance** grant favor, the **Heavenly Gates** open wide, the **Ten Thousand Chariots** begin their journey, the **Hundred Spirits** guard the path. The **Lion and White Crane** bear the **Heavenly Standards** forward; the **Responding Dragon and Azure Qiu** guide the **Imperial Chariot** swiftly. May You not reject our **mortal sincerity**, so that the **rite’s purpose** may be fulfilled, and we may receive the **Saints’ descending grace**.\n\n**The Petitioner’s Words on the Sacred Petitionary Text for Inviting the True**\nFurthermore, we pray that the **Xiao-Shao melodies** lead the way, the **canopied carriages** follow behind. The **mist wraps the rainbow robes**, the **clouds float above the moon veils**; the **Wind Lord** clears the path, the **Rain Master** washes the dust. The **Celestial Procession** moves through the **Heavenly Roads**, scattering **treasure flowers** across the **Dharma Realm**. The **swift-flying retinues** descend to the **Dao Field**. We hope to glimpse You through the **dissipating mists**, to bare our hearts in **sincere entreaty**.\n\nNow, as the evening’s **sincere devotion** begins and our **earnest prayers** are presented, the **rites of welcome** are complete, and our **attunement** is without flaw. The **round altar** is arranged, the **ranks of High Immortals** take their places. The **group of Spirits** departs from the **Emerald Caverns and Jade Palaces**, the **assembly of Saints** descends from the **Golden and Jade Halls**. They bear **banners and canopies**, **treasure umbrellas** following the **celestial carriages**, their **clouds** ascending like **jade**, their **light** gleaming like **stars**. The **Celestial Countenance** is solemn, **dark robes** held in readiness to listen to mortal pleas; the **Tai Mountain’s** grandeur stands firm, **golden tablets** presented to inspect the **rite’s solemnity**. The **Southern Bureau** takes up the brush to record the **virtuous** for **rebirth**; the **Northern Bureau** awaits to inscribe the **meritorious** for **salvation**.\n\nAt this very moment, even a fragment of virtue shall not fear the Three Realms’ ignorance;\nWith this resolve, even a slight merit shall not be surprised if the multitude of Immortals fail to record it.\n\nHow much more so when one’s devotion is profound and the assembly is sublime—\nWhen the incense altar is solemnly arranged,\nAnd one cultivates the twelvefold mind of virtue,\nFollowing the three-nine gradations of fasting discipline—\nWho would dare say the Saints and Worthies do not respond to mortals?\nWhy doubt that the hidden and manifest alike are not touched by their grace?\n\nIt is not the Dao that expands humanity—\nHumanity that expands the Dao.\n\nNow, we invite the Immortals’ passing gaze,\nFollow the ritual protocols to seal the covenant,\nUnfold our sincere pleadings,\nAnd humbly appeal to the Great Work.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms,\nThe Ten Directions and Ten Glories,\nThe Marvelous Conducted Immortals,\nThe True Great Saints,\nThe Nine-Heavenly Star Manifestations,\nAnd the Three Realms’ Awe-Inspiring Spirits—\nMay they emit the five-colored auspicious light,\nCast the Nine-Peak treasure canopy,\nDescend upon this sacred assembly,\nAccomplish our virtuous deeds,\nAll as we supplicate—\nAnd thus, the response shall be immediate and resonant.\n\nYour servants, in reverence, declare:\n\nPreviously, we submitted a white petition to the Five Masters.\nNow, the ritual feast begins, the fasting rites commence.\n\nWe gaze upon the Three Realms’ idyllic groves,\nConcentrating our hearts in silent contemplation;\nWe summon the Nine Pure Ones’ swift celestial chariots,\nRaising our hands in earnest devotion.\n\nThe array of crowned and adorned Immortals stands majestic,\nTheir awe-inspiring presence hovering in ethereal form—\nYet how can we reach the Jade Capital’s golden gates,\nThe Purple Palace’s alchemical platform,\nThe Celestial Palaces of Sun and Moon,\nThe Azure Sky’s starry halls and the Pole Star’s domain?\nThey soar beyond all earthly symbols,\nFar beyond mortal reach—\nHow can we convey the sincerity of the humble,\nOr offer the modest rites of the lowly?\n\nThe Masters’ treasures have long encompassed the Dao’s grace.\nNow, this ritual fasting is established—\nIts sincerity must be spread, its devotion must reach.\n\nYour servant, [name], humbly reflects:\nFor long have I partaken in the Mysterious Transformation,\nLong basked in the True Wind’s breath.\nToday, I choose this auspicious hour,\nReverently fulfilling my heart’s wish.\nWhether fortune or misfortune, I offer rites with utmost reverence and respect,\nSpeaking truth, not empty words.\nYet, alas, my understanding of the Dao’s worth is unheard,\nAnd I am ignorant of the True Methods.\nBy mistake, I have been entrusted with this proclamation.\n\nWe humbly beseech the Five Masters of the Numinous Treasures,\nThe Moral and Daoist Saints—\nDo not reject our earnest plea,\nAnd grant us the boundless embrace of the Great Virtue.\n\nWe request that the Four Departments and Five Imperial Officials,\nAlong with their attendants,\nAttest to this fasting ritual,\nAscend our sincere wishes,\nExamine our petitions,\nAnd in secret bestow their blessings.\nMay they ensure that at each moment, our prayers are relayed,\nOur supplications answered,\nOur wishes fulfilled,\nOur virtuous deeds made manifest,\nOur oaths steadfast and sincere—\nSo that we may, in reverence, repay their grace.\n\nYour servants, in devotion, declare:\n\nThe altar is erected, the furnace ignited.\n\nThe **prayer** is earnestly offered to the lofty heavens,\nThe **heart** devotes itself to serving the **Celestial Sovereign**;\n\nThe **Purple Clouds** descend to this humble earth,\nAnd the **Method** of summoning the **True One** is solemnly observed.\nAt the moment when the **Sage** first responds through **spiritual resonance**,\nWhen the **ritual platform** is established and the **auspicious rites** commence,\nWe uphold **sincerity** and **earnestness**,\nAnd dare to invoke the **Celestial Majesty**.\n\nThis **servant of the Dao**, by virtue of past **karmic causes**,\nWas born in the **Land of the Five Directions**,\nPossessing the **Four Great Virtues** of the realm,\nAnd sharing in the **numinous essence** of all ten thousand things.\n\nOur **fleshly bodies** are frail as silk,\nYet we endure the **sufferings** of the **hunted hare**;\nOur **forms** are human, yet our **Daoic countenance** remains,\nFortunate to retain the **compassionate grace** of the **Sage**.\n\nThe **recompense** has not yet appeared in the **smallest particle**,\nNor has the **gratitude** faded from **day and night**.\n\nOn this **auspicious day** of **good fortune**,\nWith **reverence** and **resolve** in our initial **vows**,\nAs the **water clock’s arrow** first begins its passage,\nAnd the **ritual bell’s tone** is newly struck,\nWe light the **Nine Veiled Lamps**,\nBurn the **sublime incense** of myriad wonders—\nCleansing the **dusty tumult** so that the **celestial breeze** is pure,\nRaising the **yin-qi** so that the **night’s luminosity** grows cold.\n\nAll the **three or four nights** of **devoted practice**,\nAre fulfilled in **one step** of **sincere observance**.\n\nMay our **humble supplications** ascend and be heard,\nMay the **Celestial Sovereign’s** wisdom pierce through the **distant void**,\nTemporarily leaving the **Primordial Chaos**,\nAnd descending to this **jewel-pure ritual field**.\n\nThe **Celestial Maidens** and **Golden Boys**,\nDispense **heavenly fragrance** in **dense clouds**;\nThe **rainbow banners** and **crimson flags**,\nMingle with the **flowering rain** in **splendid array**.\n\nNot neglecting the **lowliest blade of grass**,\nNor failing to **slightly comfort** the **long-held wishes** of the years.\n\nThus do we humbly address the **Five Masters of the Daoic Rituals**,\nAt the **forefront of the fasting assembly**.\n\n...your humble servant hears that the **Primordial Dao** established its teachings first,\nAnd the **Great Unity** (*Hunyuan*) already receded into **non-action** (*Wuwei*).\n\nAcross countless **kalpas** (*eons*), the **Sage** dispenses salvation to all beings,\nAnd the **treasure of the Teacher** (*Shifu*) rests upon the **favor of the Celestial Sovereign** (*Jianming*).\n\nThus, in the **Mysterious Core** (*Xuanzhong*), the **Celestial Master** (*Xuanzhong*) assumes his sacred office,\nOverseeing the **fasting assembly** (*Zhai*) with solemn vigilance—\nTransmitting the **canon** (*Jingji*) through successive generations,\nRelying upon the **Three Realms** (*Heaven, Earth, and Humanity*) for shared support,\nResponding to each **spontaneous impulse** (*Suijin*) as it arises,\nGranting every **sincere wish** (*Yuan*) without fail.\n\nNow we establish this **Treasure Fasting Hall** (*Baozhai*),\nUniting the **visible and invisible** (*Youming*) to bring benefit and deliverance.\nWe pray that the **Celestial Sovereign** may descend upon the **dusty world** (*Chenjie*),\nBestowing grace and blessings to **pervade and extend**.\n\nWith utmost reverence, we lay bare all **common sentiments** (*Fanqing*),\nAnd humbly beseech the **Teacher’s craft** (*Shizao*).\n\n**At dawn** (*Qingdan*), when **Great Clarity** (*Daming*) arises from the **eastern quarter** (*Shufang*), free of all **dusty veils** (*Chenyi*),\nEven as **night qi** lingers in the **level dawn** (*Pingdan*), how could **illness** (*Juezhuang*) perish?\nThe **Cloud Chariot** and **Crane-Drawn Vessel** hover in **leisurely flight** (*Paihuai*),\nWhile the **wild horses** of **earthly turbidity** remain **unmoved** (*Buzheng*).\n\nIf we **entrust our fate** (*Chenming*) to the **Celestial Master’s** decrees as **disaster dissolves** (*Xiaozai*),\nAnd **renew our stored blessings** (*Zai’chu*) with **sincere devotion** (*Qing*),\nHis **pity for all life** (*Haosheng*) shall be our guiding virtue—\nEntering our **intentions**, may the **pure dawn** (*Jingdan*) now **practice the Dao** (*Xingdao*),\nSealing the **ritual petitions** (*Guanzou*) to the **Highest Spirit** (*Shangling*),\nHumbly awaiting the **Teacher’s True Essence** (*Shizhen*), that he may **descend and grant his blessings** (*Chui’ao*).\n\nMay our **sincere devotion** (*Daocheng*) be **guided and perfected** (*Daocheng*) as the **radiant sun** (*Rao*) ascends,\nAnd our **hidden faults** (*Qianxia*) be **subtly cleansed** (*Qianxue*) like **thin ice** melting away.\nSo that each **fragment of virtue** (*Pianshan*) may **prevail** (*Kexu*) beyond **demonic obstacles** (*Mozhang*),\nAnd the **vast Teacher’s blessings** (*Hong’en*) may **pervade** (*Tian*) both **visible and invisible** (*Youming*),\nOur **grateful hearts** (*Gandai*) ever **present in our thoughts** (*Shizai*).\n\n**At noon** (*Linwu*), the **fasting rites** are **strict** (*Zhiyou*),\nBeginning and ending with solemn reverence—\nThe **Sage’s heart** (*Shengxin*) is **unimpeachable** (*Gezhong*), neither **partial** nor **biased**.\nSee how the **Sage** reveals the **Great Centrality** (*Dazhong*) to all,\nLike the **sun’s chariot** (*Yijiu*) driving **true and upright** (*Zhengli*), beneath the **midday sun** (*Zhongri*).\nNo **hidden darkness** escapes its light,\nAll **ten thousand things** draw upon it for their **formation and growth** (*Shengcheng*).\nEvery **sentiment** finds its way through,\nA **single thought** strikes at it and **resonates** (*Koudazhou*).\nThus, when we now **stand at noon** (*Linwu*),\nWe **again approach** (*Zai*) to **offer our sincerity** (*Shucheng*),\nUnveiling our **heartfelt words** (*Ciqing*),\nAnd **daring to petition** (*Maogan*) the **Teacher’s ear** (*Shitong*).\n\nAs it has been spoken above (*Yuruyun*).\n**In the still night** (*Jingye*).\n\nThe **Four Seasons** resound with clarity,\nThe sky is free of haze and filth,\nThe **Divine Wind** stirs in silence,\nThe earth is cleansed of all malevolent dust.\n\nThe **Big Dipper’s handle** stretches across the void,\nLifting **heartfelt words** to the celestial expanse;\nThe **moonlight** washes the night,\nChilling the **qi** in bone and hair.\n\nTrembling with reverence, we **diligently** extend our offerings;\nWith **lofty sincerity and depth**, we humbly await the **Teacher’s** gracious hearing.\n\nWe **press upon** the **True One’s** essence,\nHoping to fulfill all that should be done.\n\nAs it has been spoken above (*Yunyun*).\n\n**The Original Command Scripture**\n\nAbove, it mirrors the **Heavenly Vault** (*Huntian*),\nDividing the **Three Celestial Exaltations** (*Sanxing*) along the **Lunar Lodges** (*Jingwei*) and **Solar Paths** (*Wei*).\n\n**Great Clarity** establishes its teachings,\nSpreading the **Two Dipper Stars** (*Erdou*) across the **Water** (*Kan*) and **Fire** (*Li*) constellations.\n\nIt proclaims the **Original Command’s** grand framework,\nUnfolding the **Mysterious Spirit’s** essential keys.\n\nFor **humanity’s foundation** lies in the **Seven Elements** (*Qi Yuan*).\nHeaven’s **Dipper’s Crown** (*Doubei*) measures the **Original Qi**,\nBinding **life and fate** to the **Five Bodies** (*Wuti*).\nIt governs **longevity and early death**,\nDetermining a life’s rise or fall.\n\nThus, when the **cosmic cycles** unfold,\nOne must **contemplate the Six Degrees** (*Liu Du*),\nTo descend blessings upon the mortal realm,\nExtending the **fragrance and light** for all to **return and

storing virtue,\nto fulfill the pattern of prolonging life.\n\nIf not the birthday of the Sage,\nthen let us instead cultivate a steadfast heart for goodness,\nawaiting the blessings of benevolent grace.\n\nMay misfortune sink into the Nine Abysses,\nand blessings spread across the Ten Directions.\n\nWe, the humble servants, prostrate and offer thanks to the Supreme Triple Jewel of the Most High True One.\n\n**On Repentance:**\nThis repentance is for living beings still in existence,\nto purify the mind and still the thoughts,\nto serve the Celestial Sage with clarity—\nnot for the departed, lest there be misunderstanding of intent,\nand names of the dead be mistakenly invoked,\nfor human affairs and the Dao are utterly distinct.\n\nI have heard:\nTo seek the True Essence beyond form,\nthe Dao is pure and boundless;\nTo awaken vast aspirations within the world,\nits principle returns to purity and stillness.\n\n「To purge the external afflictions is not enough—\nonly then may one behold the Celestial Sage’s luminous presence.\n\nTo repent and cleanse the dust of worldly attachments—\nonly then may one properly fulfill the rites of the **sacrificial hall (斋直)**.\n\nNow, we humble servants repent and dedicate ourselves to the Dao,\nfrom the distant past through countless **kalpas (劫)**, down to this very life.\nAll deeds of body, speech, and mind,\nwitnessed by Heaven, Earth, and humanity—**the Six Perceptions (六见)**.\n\nWhere there is a body, there is great affliction,\nlong-accumulated sins and transgressions;\nall actions arise from the **Six Senses (六根)**, yet the **evil obstructions (恶障)** remain unremoved.\n\nTo indulge in **sensual pleasures (声色)**, to abandon oneself in licentiousness,\nwhen **vital energy (血气)** is strong, the calamity of strife arises;\nwhen **desires (嗜欲)** overflow, the sickness of life and death beckons,\never turning from the True to the False,\nstruggling to free the mind while binding the spirit.\n\nAt the commencement of these **sacrificial rites (斋事)**, we fear the **Nine Heavens (九霄)** may remain distant.\nWe wish to bathe in the **Great Mysterious Waters (太玄之水)**,\nto wash away the **Six Evil Roots (六恶根)**;\nto seek the **Six Perfections (六度)** as a vessel,\nto reach the **Dao’s shore (道岸)**.\n\nTo cultivate the **fruit of non-outflow (无漏果)**,\nto block the **pathways of all malevolent forces (众邪门)**;\nto cleanse the **Five Poisons (五菔)** and **Six Dusts (六尘)**,\nto sever the **Ten Fetters (十缠)** and **Nine Bonds (九结)**.\n\nWith one heart enlightened,\nall sins dissolved into emptiness.\n\nWe vow from this day until the next life,\nnever again to ensnare ourselves in the **net of karma (业网)**.\n\nMay the **Pure Celestial Court (清都)** observe our sincere devotion,\nand the **Supreme Polarity (紫极)** return its boundless grace,\nacknowledging our earnest striving,\nand bestowing its vast benevolence generously.\n\nFor **past sins (阴愆)** and **present transgressions (阳过)**,\nwhether **retribution from former lives (上世流注之殃)**,\nor **entanglements with the Six Relatives (六亲)**—\nthese ties, whether **fated in past incarnations (宿世所造)** or **slandered by enemies (仇家所诬)**,\nthe **poisonous winds and malevolent qi (毒风恶气)**,\nthe **torment of demons and malevolent beings (魔鬼凶人)**—\nwe pray that the **Dao’s wind (道风)** may sweep them all away,\ncleansing and purifying the **form and spirit (气形)**,\nso that at the **sacrificial altar (坛枪)**,\nwe may stand upright before the **Nine Ancestral Spirits (九祖)**,\nand attain the **fruit of the Celestial Sage (上仙)** in the future.\n\nMay we ascend to the **Everlasting Spring of the Nine Heavens (九天不夜之长春)**,\nand reach the **Realm of the Celestial Caverns (洞阳)**;\nwith **Three Kinds of Karma (三业)** unrooted, we depart forever\nfrom the **host of malevolent ghosts (万鬼)**.\n\nBlessings spread across the **Ten Directions (十方)**,\nmisfortune sinks into the **Nine Abysses (九夜)** forever.\n\nWe, the humble servants, prostrate and offer thanks to the **Supreme Triple Jewel of the Most High True One (无上至真三宝)**.\n\n**On the Opening of the Way (外坛开方):**\nThe texts for opening the way are not singular;\nthe most fitting originates from **Master Chao (巢先生)**’s cultivation of goodness.\nOthers may recount the **virtues of the Five Phases (五行之德)**,\nor explain the **origins of ghosts and gods (鬼神之由)**—\nthese too are appropriate, yet none surpass the efficacy of this text alone.\n\nThe **Nine Dragons (九龙)** bear the decree,\nascending the spirits accumulated in darkness;\nthe **Six Ghosts (六鬼)** clash in battle,\ncutting off the path to rebirth.\n\nThe **Most High (太上)** manifests through the **illuminated teachings (明训)**,\nand the **Divine Official (神公)** sweeps away the inauspicious.\nWith reverence, we present the **sacred rites (典彝)**,\nand humbly extend our **petitions (关告)**.\n\nTo hope for the **Bright Spirits (明灵)** to respond,\nwe first rely on the **chanting of the Daoist hymns (梵呗)** to exalt their names.\nWe invoke the **Universal Compassion (众慈)**,\nand all voices resonate in harmony.\n\nWe take refuge in the **Eastern Lord (东方主)、Jade Treasure Emperor of Heaven (玉宝皇上天尊)**,\nthe **Southern Lord (南方主)、Heavenly Emperor of Supreme Truth and Ten Thousand Blessings (玄真万福天尊)**,\nthe **Western Lord (西方主)、Heavenly Emperor of Ultimate Marvel and Supreme Polarity (太妙至极天尊)**,\nthe **Northern Lord (北方主)、Heavenly Emperor of Supreme Mystery and Jade Purity (玄上玉宸天尊)**,\nand the **Central Lord (中央主)、Heavenly Emperor of Supreme Unity and Rescue from Suffering (太乙救苦天尊)**,\nwhose **inconceivable merits (不可思议功德)** are vast.\n\nWith incense now burning,\nwe earnestly invoke the **Five Directions’ Open Path Great Gods (五方开路大神)**,\nthe **Earthly Sovereigns (地界主)**.\n\nMay the **Divine Benevolence (神慈)** descend and accept,\nthe **sacrificial altar (香坛)** bear witness,\nand our **sincere prayers (虔祷)** enter their hearts.\n\nIndeed, the **unfathomable interplay of yin and yang (阴阳不测)** is the **Divine Mystery (神之妙)**;\nthe **limitless transformations (变化无方)** are the **True Dao (道之真)**.\n\nOnly the **Most High (太上)** encompasses the **Divine Mystery of yin and yang (阴阳不测之神)**,\nand exhausts the **True Dao of endless transformations (变化无方之道)**.\n\nWith **Six Penetrations (六通)** and **Four Liberations (四辟)**,\nits power endures eternally;\ninstantaneous departures and sudden arrivals,\npiercing all obstructions with clarity.\n\nDescending as spirits to fulfill **manifestations (赴感)**,\nembodying the Dao to respond to humanity.\n\nThose who receive **transmission (受度)** are not divided by life or death,\nand those who return to the **True Dao (皈真)** are not bound by distance or proximity.\n\nLet it be so that a thousand years may pass in an instant,\nand ten thousand miles become as near as a hand’s span.\nAt the **sacrificial rites (醮席)**, we listen to the **lawful sounds (法音)**,\nand in the **Celestial Court’s morning (朝上帝)**, we ascend to the **True Dao (登真)**,\nhearing the **song of the void (空歌)** while awakening to the **Way (悟道)**.\n\nShould any **pursued spirit (灵识)** fail to arrive at the altar,\nor if **all earthly officials (地司)** dare to obstruct with deceit,\nhindering the **wandering souls (幽魂)** or blocking the **path to rebirth (生路)**,\nthe **Heavenly Decrees (天宪)** are stern,\nand the **True Dao’s rites (真科)** will not be forgiven.\n\nNow, the **sacrificial official (斋官)** of this household\ncommences these **extraordinary rites (殊常之斋范)**,\ninviting all **high Daoists (高真)** of the **Three Realms (三界)**.\nLanterns and stars stretch across the **Jade Slip (玉绳)**,\nand incense smoke ascends to the **Golden Gate (金阙)**.\n\nHearing the **hidden melody of the Celestial Courts (诸天一声之隐韵)**,\nall **karma of a hundred lives (百生之业障)** dissolves;\nlistening to the **piercing chapter of the Nine Judgments (司马九过之洞章)**,\nthe **forms and spirits of the Three Thousand (三万之形神)** are fully manifested.\n\nThe **departed ascend, the living are transformed (前亡后化)**—\nat every moment, spirits rise.\nYet we still fear the **three worlds’ lost souls (三世幽魂)**,\nand **nine springs’ trapped spirits (九泉滞魄)**,\nthose who have not yet been **offered salvation (荐拔)**,\nsuffering the utmost **pity and lamentation (悲酸)**.\n\nThus, we request the **talisman of eternal life and rescue from suffering (长生救苦之符)**,\nand humbly accept the **precepts of earnest devotion (克勤之戒)**,\nto proclaim within the **Yellow Talisman Altar (黄箓坛内)**,\nand present before the **Most High’s Court (太上御前)**.\n\nFirst, we admonish the **spirits and deities (神祇)**,\nand open the **Five Pathways’ messengers (开辟五路使者)**,\nlike an **unstoppable boat (不击之舟)**,\ncoming and going without obstruction.\n\nLike **cranes freed from their cage (出笼之鹤)**,\nsoaring unrestrained in the sky.\nOh, you **multitude of spirits (众灵)**,\nclear the path!\nAll **petitions and records (文牒)** are solemnly declared.\n\nOnce declared,\npresent the **petitions and records (文牒)** above,\nand instruct all **gentle deities (柔祇)** broadly.\nIf there are no records,\ndescend from the path below,\nand ascend to report,\ninstructing all **gentle deities (柔祇)** broadly.\n\nOh, **responsible deities (神司)**,\nswiftly follow the **Dao’s teachings (道训)**!\n\nTo the **local deities (界土地)**,\nthe **village and city spirits (里社城隍)**,\nthe **guardians of boundaries and protectors of realms (守疆护界)**,\nand all **upright spirits (正神)**—\nwe command you to **clear the path (辟道路)**,\nand **guide the departed (接引亡人)**.\n\nWhere there are **barriers (关者)**, swiftly open them;\nwhere there are **ferries (津者)**, swiftly transport them.\nDo not **block or hinder (勿壅勿遏)**,\ndo not **delay or pause (勿稽勿停)**.\nTo those **entangled in litigation (阴讼者)**,\ndo not **detain or imprison (勿得拘留)**.\nTo those **bound by grievances (冤对者)**,\ndo not **entangle or bind (勿得缠缚)**.\n\nFor those coming from the **East (东来)**,\nthe **Green Cavalry General (青骑将军)** shall escort them;\nfrom the **West (西来)**,\nthe **Great God of the Gui Trigram (兑卦大神)** shall protect them;\nfrom the **South (南来)**,\nthe **Red Bird’s (朱雀)** earthly pathways are made smooth;\nfrom the **North (北来)**,\nthe **Dark Tortoise’s (玄武)** realm is opened wide.\n\nWithout **far or near (无远无近)**,\nwithout **affinity or estrangement (无亲无疏)**,\nwe follow the **Green Decree’s (依女青)** command,\nand review the **names and surnames of the ancestral spirits (先灵之名姓)**.\n\n「沿路关报，逐界申闻，\nalong the way, announce to the officials,\nand in each domain, proclaim the message.\n\n拨发前来，斯须无滞，\ndispatch them forthwith—\nno delay shall hinder their passage.\n\n即使亡过某等，\nEven if they have committed grave offenses,\n如晨风之趋林，\nlike the morning wind rushing toward the forests,\n如夜蛾之赴火，\nlike the night moths drawn to flames,\n如水之东注，\nlike water flowing eastward,\n如马之出奔，\nlike horses breaking free from their bonds,\n径赴道场，\nthey shall proceed directly to the Daoist ritual hall,\n领沾功德。\nto partake in the merit and

restraint,\n敢生邀阻，\nwho dare to obstruct or hinder,\n请戮路左，\nlet them be slaughtered by the wayside—\n以明天诛。\nto make manifest the Heavenly punishment.\n\n道法甚严，\nThe Daoist laws are strict,\n天威难犯，\nand Heaven’s wrath is not to be provoked.\n度人功大，\nthe merit of guiding souls is vast,\n风火不停，\nand the winds and flames shall not cease.\n道路山川，\nLet all paths and rivers\n急急传命，\nswiftly convey this

(*huǒliànchí*—火炼池).\n空洞谣歌齐赞咏，\nLet all empty and resonant hymns unite in praise,\n敢凭道力拯灵仪。\nand let them rely on the Dao’s power to rescue the sacred souls.\n\n黄箓大斋第一度：\nThe First Degree of the Grand

ages.\n膺上帝之休命，\nThey received the Heavenly Mandate of auspicious fate,\n授列职之仙班。\nand were appointed to the ranks of the celestial immortals.\n\n故《混元图翼》所载云：\nThus, the *Hunyuan Tu* (混元图)

celestial immortals,\n名垂信史，\ntheir names recorded in trustworthy histories.\n或享世间庙食之盛，\nSome enjoy the grand offerings of mortal temples,\n或主岳渎鬼神之权。\nothers hold authority over the mountain altars and

those who govern the authority over the mountain altars and waterways of spirits.\n\nThus, *Zhao Gong* (召公) and *Ji Zi* (季子) are both the Lords of *Southern Brightness* (南明) and *Northern Brightness* (北明);\n*Qi Heng* (齐恒) and *Jin Wen* (晋文) hold the office of *Director of the Celestial Command* (司命都禁).\n\n*Yuan Gui* (元规) and *You Yu* (幼舆) serve as *Left Celestial Guards* (左司禁);\n*Yuan Zhi* (元直)

*Great Calamity* (大劫).\n\nThe *Heavenly Court’s* (上天) promotions and demotions are profound and mysterious,\nNot discernible by the limited senses of the mortal realm.\n\nOnly through accumulated merit and virtue do they gradually attain *Daoist immortality* (仙位).\nHow much more so in this land of *Sichuan’s* (兹庸蜀) *abundant Daoist networks* (井络之地),\nWhich truly rests upon the auspicious foundation of *Zeng Chang* (曾昌)!\n\nThe *divine horses of gold and green birds* (金马碧鸡) are revered by imperial decree,\nThe *copper gates and jade ramparts* (铜关玉垒) of their temples protect the *Earthly Foundation* (坤维).\n\nThe *group of celestial lords* (群望) governs in appointed roles,\nWhile the *mild and virtuous* (柔示) are stationed in their places.\n\nFrom *Sichuan* (蜀郡), this system is extended by analogy,\nCovering all lands—each has its *Daoist framework* (纲维).\n\nMountains and rivers, the nine regions,\nJade and silk offerings from myriad lands,\nAll are governed by spirits.\n\nThe *hidden and distant temples* (幽隐庙貌) are everywhere,\nFrom near to far—those who benefit the people\nAre honored by all spirits.\n\nNow, there is a family dedicated to the Dao,\nWho follows the *Nine Altars’* (九坛) traditions and rituals,\nWho observes the *Three Arrow* (三箓) rites of the Dao,\nAscending to the *Idyllic Heaven* (郁罗之天),\nEncompassing the *Heavenly and Earthly Realms* (乾坤之界),\nDescending to the *Abyssal Daoist Caverns* (洞渊之府),\nAnd reaching into the *Remote Northern Lands* (朔都之乡).\n\nWith a single thought, they resonate with the *True and Authentic* (真灵),\nAnd all spirits gather in response.\n\nTo the *Heavenly, Earthly, Watery, and Land-based* (天地水陆),\nThey pray and make offerings in all directions;\nThe spirits of mountains and rivers, of all lands,\nAssemble in the *boundless* (无方).\n\nI humbly pray that the *One True Spirit* (大恢得一之灵)\nMay come from the *boundless* (无方),\nTo fulfill the command of *summoning the True Person with the Jade Tablet* (碧简招真),\nAnd to join the ranks of *those who attend the Golden Portal* (金阙朝真),\nTo exalt the *Heavenly Auspices* (天休),\nAnd to safeguard the *imperial lineage* (国祚).\n\nMay they *seal the powers of life and death* (封掌生死),\nAnd open the *path of ease and convenience* (方便之门);\nMay they *grasp the balance of yin and yang* (把握阴阳),\nAnd ascend to the *Age of the Sovereign’s Supreme Dao* (皇极之世).\n\nI humbly pray that they may *temporarily dwell in the celestial chariot* (暂驻风云之驭),\nAnd *descend to partake in the offerings of the Daoist community* (俯歆苹藻之羞),\nTo *bestow blessings upon the solemn rites* (阴佑斋功),\nAnd to *fulfill the harmonious aspirations* (克谐愿望).\nMay they *extend their praise again* (再伸偈颂),\nAnd *touch the hearts of the mighty and numinous* (感格威灵).\n\nThe *emperors and kings* (帝王) study ancient traditions and emulate the *Heavenly Craft* (代天工),\nDifferent teachings converge in the *Great Central Dao* (建大中).\n\nThe *sovereign’s loyal ministers* (元首股肱) serve with unwavering devotion,\nAnd the *spirits and Daoist saints* (鬼神贤圣) are revered in equal measure.\n\nIn mortal rites, they honor the *ancestors and sages* (祀典思遗列),\nWhile in the celestial ranks, they *respond to the swift and mighty* (仙班答骏功).\nWith incense and fire offerings, they strictly adhere to the *broad Daoist precepts* (溥告),\nAnd pray to *align the celestial chariot with their sincere intentions* (愿驱云驭格精衷).\n\n**Second Degree: Inviting the Departed Souls**\nThe *wandering soul* (游魂) is restless, and the *Great Night* (大夜) never brightens.\nThey must *lean upon the Nine-Colored Golden Light* (必倾九色之金光),\nAnd *use the Iron Locks of Darkness* (用掣重阴之铁锁).\n\nThe *Great Dao is without obstruction* (大方无碍),\nAnd the *myriad laws are illuminated* (万法昭融).\nThe *Celestially Revered* (举天尊) proclaims:\n\nThere is a *formless substance* (有物混成),\nFrom which the *Sovereign* (皇) gives birth to *Heaven and Earth* (生天地).\nThe *round and clear* (圆清) and the *square and turbid* (方浊)\nWithin it give rise to humanity.\nThis is called the *Three Talents* (三才),\nEach possessing its *Daoist nature* (道性).\n\n*Heaven endures, Earth lasts* (天长地久),\nWithout beginning or end,\nThey *propel the flow of yin and yang* (推荡阴阳),\nAnd *divide the cycles of darkness and light* (裁割昏晓).\nThe *uninterrupted breath of qi* (一气不息)\nGives birth to all forms (万形以生),\nDistinctly manifesting as *divinity* (卓然有神),\nKnown as the *Creative Transformation* (造化).\n\nHumans dwell within it,\nAbove, aligned with the *Two Principles* (两仪) of Heaven and Earth,\nThough noble and humble differ,\nThe *virtuous and the foolish* (贤愚) are distinguished.\n\nWhat they receive from this source,\nIs the *same initial essence* (一初).\nThey *embrace yin and hold yang* (负阴抱阳),\nWith *round heads and square feet* (圆首方趾).\n\nFrom infancy, they *preserve their pure spirit* (精守神全),\nTheir *Heavenly Truth* (天真) untainted,\nTheir *mixed and primordial state* (混沌) unbroken,\nThey do not covet wealth and nobility,\nNor do they scorn poverty and lowliness,\nThough they possess *sentience and knowledge* (含识知),\nTheir essence remains *pure and untainted* (纯粹精白).\nThis is the *True and Authentic Nature* (真实性),\nWithout *deceit or falsehood* (无邪伪心),\nAnd to be born as a human is what is most precious.\n\nAs they grow older,\nTheir bodies interact with the world,\nGradually losing their *Heavenly Truth* (天真),\nAnd being *corrupted by human desires* (熏煎人欲).\nThe *innocence of childhood* (赤子之性) diminishes day by day, month by month,\nEndless beings arise,\nEndless streams of existence flow,\nYet they only *pursue worldly attachments* (务逐物),\nAnd do not *know the love of origin* (爱缘).\n\nHow few recognize that this body,\nAbove, is aligned with *Heaven and Earth* (配天地),\nThat it *originates from the womb* (始从胎育),\nAnd *descends from the Nine Heavens* (降气九天).\nWhen the *ten months are complete* (十月既圆),\nAll *ten thousand spirits* (万神) guard it.\nOnce the form is born,\nThe *seven orifices* (七窍) open,\nThe *nine palaces* (九宫) are arranged upon the head,\nWhere the *Nine True Spirits* (九真) reside,\nThe *five viscera* (五藏) are divided within,\nEach with its own *spirit* (神).\n\nThe *Three Souls* (三魂) dwell in the liver,\nDesiring that humans act virtuously.\nThe *Seven Spirits* (七魄) reside in the lungs,\nDesiring that humans act wickedly.\nThe *Twenty-Four True Spirits* (二十四真),\nAre divided among the *three departments* (三部):\nThe *Purple Gates and Jade Pavilions* (紫户玉阁),\nThe *Crimson Palaces and Vermilion Fields* (绛宫丹田),\nAnd within, the *True Person* (真人),\nKnown as the *Innocent Child* (赤子),\nWhere *ten thousand Heavenly Spirits* (天地神气) and *thirty-six thousand* (三万六千)\nConverge—every *joint and subtle mechanism* (关节机微)\nIs under their control.\n\nHow noble is the human body!\nMost noble is the *One True Spirit* (一真),\nThe *original essence* (初生),\nPure and untainted,\nAnd humans, in their worldly existence,\nEach know how to *preserve their own* (自存).\n\nThe *divine spirits within the body* (周身中神) rejoice and surge.\nThe *stars upon the crown* (顶戴之星)\nShine brightly and radiate.\n\nThe **refined essence** (精炼),\nCan attain the **Daoist Sage** (神仙).\n\nThe **true and genuine compassion and benevolence** (真正慈仁),\nAlso allow one to **long endure** (久视).\n\nIf one **contrary to this** (反此),\nNo **evil fate** (恶缘) will fail to befall them.\n\nThe **Heavenly Spirits and vital qi** (神气) daily **degenerate** (日衮),\nThe **stellar lights** (星光) grow dim each day.\nThe **original nature of the One True Spirit** (一真之性),\nEven unto death remains **unrecognized** (不知).\n\nThey **betray the Great Dao** (上辜大道),\nThe **fate of transformation** (混成之缘),\nAnd **fail the dual principles** (下负两仪),\nThe **path of equilibrium** (受中之道).\n\nIn **endless darkness** (冥冥),\nThey journey ever onward,\nAnd **consort with ghosts** (与鬼为徒).\nThe **ten thousand spirits** (万神) mourn in sorrow,\nEach **abandoning their mortal form** (各去其体).\n\nSome **sink into eternal night** (沦幽夜),\nOthers **fall under the jurisdiction of ghosts** (属鬼官).\nTo **seek rebirth beyond** (超生),\nIs **utterly without hope** (渺无涯涘).\n\nOnly **my Supreme Lord** (太上),\nThrough **countless kalpas** (历劫) **proclaims compassion** (宣慈),\nIn the **stream of life and death** (生死流),\n**Clears the path** (辟津梁路).\n\nThe **divine banner** (神旛) **opens the Dao** (启道),\nThe **Golden Edict** (黄诏) **summons the spirits** (招魂),\nThe **fragrant waters** (香水) **purify defilements** (荡瑕),\nThe **Law Bridge** (法桥) **rescues the drowning** (拯溺),\nThe

(死灭后),\nIn the **various realms of suffering** (苦趣),\nMay **arouse the mind of repentance** (发回向心),\nAnd **acknowledge the Heavenly True Self** (认处天真),\n**Repenting evil deeds** (忏悔恶业),\n**Riding the

expounded** (上所说),\n**Fully recorded in the True Scriptures** (具载真经).\n\n**Perilous is the single mind** (危哉一心),\nBound in the **wheel of life and death** (生死轮转).\nYet **my Supreme Lord** (太上),\n**Vows unceasingly** (弘誓不忘),\nThat **all beings may awaken to the Dao** (皆得悟道).\n\nNow, **a certain family** (某家),\nThrough **incense and refined offerings** (熏修妙供),\n**Awakens the living** (启迪生方),\nAnd **respectfully invokes the distant** (谨即长途),\nTo **extend their summoning** (以伸告召).\n\nMay the **departed** (亡者)\n**Each recognize their Heavenly True Self** (各识天真),\nWith **their original spiritual essence** (以本性灵),\n**Uniting all their vital spirits and qi** (合诸魂气).\n\n**Loudly calling forth** (大声疾呼),\nTheir **names and lineages unconfused** (名姓不迷).\n**Widely opening the

at the Dao’s threshold** (即到道前),\n**No hindrance remains** (了无壅滞).\n\nAgain, **raising the Daoist hymn** (再伸仙偈),\nTo **invoke and guide the departed spirits** (招引亡魂).\n\n---\n*The Dao penetrates Heaven and Earth, unique among humanity’s paths*,\n*A single gathering of Heavenly True Self yields a body of ten thousand treasures*.\n*Chasing after worldly things brings one to sink in the sea of life and death*,\n*Observing the body—who then becomes a Sage or Holy One?*\n*The essence of gold, even refined a hundred times, still retains its nature*,\n*Flame repeatedly kindled returns to its original True Self*.\n**Hoisting the divine banner dispels all obstructions**,\n**Summoning all spirits to emerge from the misty crossing**.\n\n---\n**Third Degree: The Night of Deep Obscurity** (沉阴戒夜),\nEven **ghostly officials may be called forth** (鬼正可呼).\n**Spirits lost in confusion** (滞爽迷方),\nThe **Dao always brings salvation** (道常善救).\n\n**Invitation to the Mind:**\n**Raise the Holy Name** (举圣号).\n\n**The Origin of the Supreme Polarity**,\nthe Two Principles are thus divided.\nThe light and clear become Heaven, the Three Celestial Luminaries arrayed in order,\nthe heavy and turbid become Earth, myriad beings springing forth in clusters.\nBetween the Six Extremes, there is inner and outer,\nin the movement of **One Qi** (One Breath), there is upright and perverse.\nWithin, there is harmony and balance—**virtue/power** (德) is the nature of humanity.\nThe accumulation of **One Qi** (One Breath) in moderation gives rise to Sages and Holy Ones.\nDwelling in the common crowd, they merge as ordinary folk.\nGathering in rebellion and inversion, they become ghosts and demons.\nThe remainder, mixed and confused, descend to beasts.\nThe world is thus created, and all beings are distinguished by their kind.\n\nIn the age of **grass and dimness** (primordial chaos), when life was unstable,\nthe ancient Sages arose and established these teachings.\nNobility and humility, honor and lowliness,\nthe refined and the uncivilized, human and beast—\neach found its proper place,\nso none would be overturned and inverted.\n\nWhere the **Kunlun Mountains** stand,\nbelow lies **China** (the Central Realm),\nand the Sages transmitted the **Dao/Way**,\nsteadfastly upholding its center.\nWith **virtue/power** (德) and righteousness established,\nloyalty and filial piety emerging together,\nthrough sincerity and reverence,\nthrough propriety and law,\nthey ordained many ways to prevent even a single stray thought.\n\nA thought aligned with uprightness,\nnot crossing into the improper—\nthis is to be Heaven, to be humanity,\nto be divine, to be a Sage.\n\nBut if one turns to rebellion and inversion,\nto ferocity and cruelty, to violence and retribution,\nwilling to join the demonic ranks and battle the heavens—\nwithin the **Dao/Way of humanity** (人道),\nto violate the fundamental principles,\nis to lose one’s human form and fall into the earthly hells,\nwhere iron cities encircle flames,\nand copper pillars are slick with blood.\nEndless debts of karmic recompense,\nendless cycles of vengeance and suffering,\nwhere specters question their shadows,\nand skulls lament their solitude.\nIn the boundless void, without reliance,\nthey sigh and groan in endless despair.\n\n**Greed, anger, and delusion** (三毒) fuel the karmic fire,\nwith no way to escape its burning.\nHungry ghosts wander beside,\nreceiving punishment for their deeds.\nAll realms rise and fall—\nall originate from humanity.\n\n**Beware, the heart’s smallest inch—**\nits strength rivals creation.\nA single awakening suffices to dispel all accumulation,\nand the **Primordial Dao/Way** (先天) will not be obstructed.\nA single delusion, once lost, cannot be retrieved—\neven all the Buddhas cannot save.\n\nWithin the heart’s measure,\nthe Six Realms cycle endlessly.\nThrough the Three Realms,\none traverses countless kalpas.\n\nThe **karmic fire** blazes fiercely,\nconsuming the **Great Thousand Worlds** (大千).\nLike fleeting water, it vanishes into the boundless,\nand one drifts through the Eight Extremes.\n\nAt this juncture,\nin frantic flight and haste,\nthey cry out in sorrow—\nwho then can rescue them?\n\nOnly our **Great Compassionate and Merciful Father, the Primordial Sovereign of Heaven** (元始天尊),\nemits boundless radiance,\nilluminating all without exclusion.\nIn the **sea of karmic forces** (业力海),\nHe steers the **compassionate vessel** (慈航).\nIn the **city of tormenting flames** (虐焰城),\nHe pours the **lawful rain** (法雨).\nWith **jade-like mercy** (玉颜恻隐),\nHis **golden hands** (金手) lift and guide.\n\nThrough His **Great Spiritual Penetration** (大神通),\nHe awakens their true nature.\nIn the blink of an eye,\nthey escape the wheel of suffering.\nIn the span of a closed breath,\neach recognizes their past destinies.\n\nWhile living beings remain undelivered,\nHis compassionate vow endures.\nFor all future beings,\nHe grants universal liberation.\n\nNow, this humble household,\nrelying on His sacred oath,\nproclaims the **auspicious cause** (良因),\nfor kin and kindred alike,\nall may be elevated and saved.\n\nFrom the **realm of desire** (色欲界) to the **abyssal depths** (洞渊泉),\nfrom **China’s domain** (中华区) to lands without measure,\nfor **heavenly beings, humans, ghosts, and those in hell** (天人鬼狱),\nof varied realms and ranks—\nwe turn the **Great Vehicle’s chariot** (大乘辕),\nand all ascend together.\n\nWe humbly vow:\nMay each, through the **law’s power** (法力),\narrive at the **Dao/Way’s threshold** (道前),\nand behold the **Heavenly Sovereign** (天尊),\nreceiving equal deliverance.\n\nA single resonant void,\ncleansing the sincerity of those entangled in filth;\nall sentient beings,\nentering the **suspended pearl’s aperture** (悬珠之窍).\n\nAgain, we recite the **verses of the Dao** (偈颂),\nto gather wandering souls.\n\nFrom the **uppermost darkness** (昙誓) to the **abyssal depths** (渊泉),\nthe Six Extremes are traversed, the **Great Thousand Worlds** (大千) all reached.\nThe enlightened dwell beyond form and vessel,\nwhile the deluded cannot escape the bonds of life and death.\nThe **karmic wheel** ceases to turn with grasping,\nwho then knows the **transformation of the Dao’s essence** (体悟迁)?\n\nThe **void’s treasure-pearl aperture** (空际宝珠通窍道),\nthe **darkened heart** (冥心) pleads to the **Primordial Sovereign** (元始) for mercy.\n\nBaptized in the **rites of deliverance** (度魂仪),\nwe humbly confess:\nIn the **yellow underworld’s abyss** (黄泉溟漠),\nthe **turbulent and impure qi** (凝浊滞染) clings to the spirit;\nin the **black soil’s obscurity** (黑壤幽阴),\nthe **accumulated filth** (积秽) sinks deep into the **vital essence** (灵爽).\nThrough the endless night of darkness,\nascension is difficult to achieve.\n\nThus, the **Supreme Most High** (太上) in compassion,\nthe **Primordial Emperor** (元皇) in sorrow,\ndescends with the **law of cleansing toil** (洗涤尘劳之法),\nand proclaims the **rites of baptism and purification** (沐浴炼度之仪).\nEven if the **karmic net** is severed,\nand the **roots of sin** (罪根) are absolved—\ntoday, we solemnly prepare the **treasure-chamber** (宝室),\nand purify the **fragrant bath** (兰汤).\nWe establish the **five-scented ablution rites** (五香澡盥之仪),\nand follow the **three registers of exorcism** (三箓拯拔之格).\n\nWe invite the **departed souls** (亡过某等),\nto attend the chamber and be cleansed,\nto dispel the turbid and flow the pure,\nand after the rites, to return to their place and listen to the **law**.\n\nWe humbly confess:\nThe **paths of the underworld** (泉路) are deep and dark,\nthe **cold halls** (寒庭) accumulate filth,\nso the **spirit** (神魂) grows obscured,\nand the **vital essence** (灵爽) is clouded by ignorance.\nWithout the **merit of recommendation** (资荐之功),\nascension is impossible to hope for.\n\nWe, the assembly of the **law**, (请法众等),\noffer this for the **departed souls** (亡灵),\nto aid their passage into the **immortal realm** (往生仙界).\n\nWe recite the **Bath of Purification Incantation** (沐浴荡秽咒):\n*The skies are clear, the qi refined, five colors radiant and bright.*\n*The sun and moon emit their splendor,*\n*to wash and purify the body’s form.*\n*The divine ford is dissolved,*\n*fragrant waters flow with clarity.*\n*The light shines forth in brilliance,*\n*illuminating the Uppermost Purity.*\n*The qi does not receive impurity,*\n*the Five Palaces accept the essence.*\n*Guilt vanishes from the Three Abysses,*\n*calamity fades from the Nine Underworlds.*\n*The roots of evil are severed,*\n*blessings naturally arise.*\n*Today’s great vow,*\n*all is now declared.*\n*The body receives liberation,*\n*ascending to the Imperial Court.*\n\nWe humbly confess:\nFor the **spirit to fly into the Dao’s realm** (神飞仙境),\nit must rely on the **merit of purification** (炼度之功);\nfor the **vital essence to depart from obscurity** (魄离幽阴),\nit may attain the **fruit of ascension** (升真之果).\nTo sever earthly filth,\nand swiftly gain passage—\nto gather harmonious **qi** (气) in the **body-field** (身田),\nand to resolve past grievances in the **karmic net** (业网).\n\nWe, the assembly of the **law**, (请法众等),\noffer this for the **departed souls** (亡灵),\nto aid their passage into the **immortal realm** (往生仙界).\n\nWe recite the **Bath of Purification Incantation for the Dao’s True Nature** (沐浴炼真咒):\n*The Supreme Most High and True, the essence of the Nine Spirits.*\n*May the spirit fly into the Dao,*\n*and ascend to the Purple Court.*\n*Baptized in the Pool of Splendor,*\n*the body and spirit become clear.*\n*The essence penetrates the Great Emptiness,*\n*and ten thousand breaths arise anew.*\n\nWe humbly confess:\nThe **yellow register** (黄箓) descends with its teachings,\nthe **Purple Court** (紫清) establishes its doctrine,\nto save the living and deliver the dead—\nall enter the **law’s gate** (法门).\n*We open the divine court of flowing fire,*\n*to purify and remove obscurity;*\n*We stir the lawful waters of radiant clarity,*\n*to wash away the toil of the earthly.*\n*One may ascend to the land of purity,*\n*and behold the Sages of the Void.*\n\nWe, the assembly of the **law**, (请法众等),\noffer this for the **departed souls** (亡灵),\nto aid their passage into the **immortal realm** (往生仙界).\n\nWe recite the **Dan Yang Incantation for the Purification of Departed Souls** (丹阳炼度亡魂咒):\n\nThe Dragon Han flows boundless, formless, nameless.\nThrough countless eons, the Imperial Dao shines bright.\nDivine clarity radiates—nine souls exhale their essence.\nJade Emptiness glows pure, the Great Vermilion ascends sublime.\n\nThe Primordial Origin opens cultivation;\nAll celestial hosts gather in attendance.\nThe Three Primordials nourish the Way,\nThe Two Symbols govern life’s transformation.\nThe unenlightened are enlightened,\nThe unformed are perfected.\nThe dead are transformed, the withered bloom anew.\nAll sentient souls—stirring, breathing—\nConceived in wombs, all receive rebirth.\nThis auspicious day, all attain radiance.\nThe Five Emperors gaze upon them,\nProclaiming to ten thousand souls.\n\nHeaven and Earth’s deities,\nAnd the rivers’ sources,\nThe Five Peaks and Four Seas,\nAnd all named mountains,\nThe Cavernous Primordial, Cavernous Void,\nCavernous Emptiness, Cavernous Immortal,\nThe Boundless Great Sage, the Most True and Noble Deity,\nThe Boundless and Limitless—all compassionately oversee and deliver life.\n\nWhen the earthly roots are severed,\nThe Primordial Register records their names.\nAll the True Ones respond,\nAll obey.\n\nFor the stagnant souls trapped in the springs,\nBy the law’s power, they ascend;\nThe suffering souls in the bitter sea,\nHear the immortal’s voice and attain liberation.\nSwiftly depart the turbid waves,\nDirectly ascend the Pure Capital,\nTransformed among mortals,\nForever dwelling in blessings and longevity.\n\nWe, the assembly of the law,\nOffer this for the departed souls,\nTo aid their passage into the immortal realm.\n\nWe recite the **Bathing at the Eastern Well Incantation**:\nThe Heavenly River washes the Eastern Well,\nWhere the Stone Mirror’s water spirit resides.\nRound light sweeps the luminous soul,\nDark radiance gleams high and clear.\nThe Primordial Origin sustains the heavy night,\nHeavenly beings follow the moon’s birth.\nBathing in the Orchid Pool above,\nA dragon bears the Long Star’s vessel.\nThe Golden Boy scatters fragrant waters,\nThe Jade Maiden flows the Five Stars.\nCrowns and sashes are cleansed in jade dew,\nFive immortals are refined in form.\nFragrance descends upon all gods,\nAscending the luminous heights on their shadows.\n\nFor the compassionate heart saves beings,\nThe scriptures deliver people,\nOpening the path for all to return.\nFirst, they are cleansed in purity,\nThen their souls attain boundless freedom.\n\nWe, the assembly of the law,\nOffer this for the departed souls,\nTo aid their passage into the immortal realm.\n\nWe recite the **Pure Water Soul-Delivery Incantation**:\nMajestic is the Dao’s noble virtue,\nIts merits already complete.\nDescending to guide and lead,\nThe teacher and protector come together.\nThe compassionate, wondrous law-water\nWashes away folly and delusion.\nForever crossing to the Three Pure’s shores,\nLong farewell to the Five Turbidities’ mire.\n\nFor stirring the turbid and uplifting the pure,\nTheir ranks are already perfected;\nAscending the True and escaping calamity,\nTheir aid extends to both the living and the dead.\nNow the bathing is complete,\nFoulness has been dispelled,\nThe spirit and mind are pure,\nSuffering and torment are removed.\n\nWe respectfully invite the departed,\nNow adorned in new crowns and sashes,\nTo come before the Dao and pay homage to the compassionate sage,\nTo receive the seals and precepts.\n\nWe, the assembly of the law,\nOffer this for the departed souls,\nTo aid their passage into the immortal realm.\n\nWe recite the **Incantation for Donning Robes and Sashes**:\nThe Five Turbidities are cleansed,\nThe Eight Sceneries are bright.\nToday they undergo refinement,\nGuilt is destroyed, blessings arise.\nForever equal to the Five Emperors,\nThey join the ranks of the Highest Spirits.\nForm and spirit are both wondrous,\nAscending to be reborn in the Southern Court.\n\nNow the bathing is complete,\nTheir purity is perfected,\nTheir rainbow robes flutter fragrant,\nTheir cloud-steps depart the chamber.\nRespectfully facing the Three Pure’s throne,\nThey proclaim the Nine Keys’ true teachings,\nReceive the seals and precepts,\nTranscend the mundane to attain sainthood,\nAnd surely achieve the wondrous fruit,\nSwiftly realizing the immortal realm.\n\nThe spirit and soul abide,\nBowing to the summons.\n\n**The Sweet Dew Law-Food Rite is invoked.**\nThe master sits and recites the **Primordial Lord’s Invocation for Invitation**:\nThe Primordial Lord issues the teachings,\nHighest among all the Ways.\nThrough countless eons, He delivers beings,\nPropagating the Heavy Darkness’ meaning.\nTo broaden the ferry’s path,\nOne must first perform the invocation ritual.\nHoping to observe the Great Construction’s wisdom,\nTo serve as the dependent refuge for the departed souls.\nWhere heavenly light illuminates,\nThe sweet dew is imbued with spirit.\nEach must firmly grasp the sincere sincerity,\nAscending to the Void’s saints.\n\nWe recite the **Jade Purity’s Wise Command Invocation**:\nWith bowed head, we honor the Dark-Wisdom Void-Worthy,\nWith bowed head, we return to the Heavy Darkness Master.\nThe Heavenly Earth’s virtue is beyond measure,\nAll beings rely on You as their refuge.\nWith compassion, You turn the Five Paths’ wheel of souls,\nWith pity, You rescue the Three Realms’ hellish sufferings.\nWe return to the Golden Gate’s Heavenly Worthy,\nWe return to the Six Perfections’ compassionate father.\nWe return to the Supreme Jade Purity,\nForever free from birth and death’s endless cycle.\nExiting to enter the Void—no dependence remains,\nAble to transform decay into immortality.\nEncounters in countless eons are rare,\nFor all beings, You expound on karma’s causes and conditions.\nReviving the corpse, eternal life is raised,\nEnsuring form and spirit suffer no change.\n\nWhen gathered, they are life—\nThe four limbs rely on nourishment and drink;\nWhen dispersed, they are qi—\nA single soul needs no food to sustain it.\nKnowing the truth of death,\nThe form becomes empty space;\nUnderstanding life’s essence,\nThe qi encompasses ten thousand forms.\nIf the spiritual nature remains unenlightened,\nThen karmic consciousness brings delusion—\nWhere does the soul’s qi not wander?\nIt binds itself to the decaying body,\nTransforming with all things,\nEver more entangled.\nWhen thoughts arise, calamities follow.\nBearing karmic obstacles,\nThe wind of karma blows harshly,\nEnduring bitter suffering;\nCraving food and drink,\nThe fire of hunger burns fiercely,\nNever sated.\n\nSuch inversion makes transcendence difficult.\nThus, the Most High, in compassion,\nThe Primordial Lord, in pity,\nReveals the Dao’s wonders through fragrant offerings,\nAnd washes away folly with law-water’s coolness.\nThey scatter the darkness of the underworld’s heavy gloom,\nAnd moisten the inner heat of all beings.\nThe merits are profound, the benefits boundless.\n\nNow, the officiant of this ritual, [Name]’s family,\nOffers this for the departed [Name],\nWho has departed the dusty world,\nFearing to sink into the dark night.\nWith sincere devotion, they revere and elevate them.\nPurifying the world’s delicacies,\nRelying on the Heavenly Lord’s law-bestowal.\n\nYou all should now sever the sound of withered hearts,\nTaste the richness of the Dao,\nDrink the elixir of the Heavenly and Immortal’s mingled essence,\nFeast on the Supreme Ultimate’s harmonious qi.\n\nThose who delight in the Southern teachings\nFollow accordingly, taking Heaven and Earth as their spring and autumn;\n\n---\n\nThey who return their heads to the Dao are born anew,\nStanding tall as they see death and life as night and day.\n\nA single word of insight unlocks boundless liberation—\nThey lean upon the *Ganlu*[1] scripture’s radiance,\nTo awaken the self-luminous nature of their hearts.\n\nReciting the *Open Business-Dao and Unlock True Paths*[2] incantation:\nIts golden-lighted merits open the dim gates—\nSubtle yet vast, dispelling the deepest obscurity.\n\nFrom the *Hua Chi*[3] flows the scent of truth,\nLotus canopies drift with clouds.\nA thousand spirits rejoice in the Primordial Harmony,\nDwelling eternally in the Twelve Palaces.\n\nSwiftly proclaiming the *Lingbao*[4] essence,\nThey roam at will through the Heavenly Realm.\n\nThe *Lingquan*[5] enfolds the Five Phases,[6]\nNourishing all things yet preserving the Dao’s subtlety;\nThe *Fashui*[7] flows through the Hundred Valleys,[8]\nReceiving all impurities yet containing none.\n\nBearing Heaven’s singular essence as their Sovereign,\nThey generate the Supreme Benevolence as their Virtue,\nConforming to the conditions to manifest as crooked or straight,\nAdapting to the vessel to become square or round.\n\nBy reason tracing its origin—\nThe more exhausted the inquiry, the deeper the mystery;\nBy the Dao revealing its function—\nThe more refined the clarity, the more profound the unrest.\n\nExternally, they purge the Six Senses and Ten Evils,[9]\nFreeing them from heat and torment, from weariness and suffering;\nExternally, they irrigate the Nine Orifices and Hundred Bones,[10]\nAchieving the elixir of golden nectar and jade essence.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord establishes teachings,\nTo rescue the lost in the netherworld.\nBy this praise and offering, they extend boundless support.\n\nFor the departed, they recite the *Open Throat and Universal Moistening*[11] incantation of nourishment:\n\nAlas, the endless night of suffering,\nTormented by the Three Paths of heat.\nFierce flames enter the throat—\nThe longing for eternal life, for quenchless thirst.\n\nA single sprinkle of *Ganlu* nectar,\nCools the burning as the cold of clarity.\n\nThe spirit-soul ascends to the Great Luo,[12]\nMoistening all things.\n\nThe scent of scentless fragrance is priceless—\nBurn it, and it returns sevenfold in misty abundance;\nThe Dao permeates Nature—\nInvoke it, and nine luminous rays radiate in splendor.\n\nThus, the Dao is learned through the heart,\nYet the heart relies on fragrance to transmit it.\nSuch is its use—\nNeither fire nor smoke;\nSuch is its observation—\nNeither millet nor barley.\n\nWithin it, no delusion remains,\nIts fragrance drifts far.\n\nAscending to the Three Realms and Ten Heavens,[13]\nDescending through the Nine Abysses and Five Paths,[14]\nRevealing its profound mysteries,\nThey offer the departed soul,\nBurning it toward the furnace,\nExtending boundless support.\n\nThey present the scentless, priceless fragrances of the Heavens:\n*Return-Soul Fragrance*,\n*Reverse-Wind Fragrance*,\n*Inverted-Wind Fragrance*,\n*Seven-Colored Fragrance*,\n*Heavenly Treasure Fragrance*—\nTheir scent misty and pervasive,\nRadiating through the Ten Directions,\nExtending boundless support.\n\nThe flowers:\nUpon the *Yujing Mountain*[15], naturally arise the Seven Treasures Forest;\nWithin the *Dahai Courtyard*[16], spread the Eight *Qian*[17] Trees.\nLush and vibrant, their verdure unfolds in emerald splendor.\nFeasting on the *Qian* Tree’s leaves,\nThey become the Jade Immortals—\nTheir bodies transparent as jade, luminous within;\nConsuming the Seven Treasures Forest’s blossoms,\nThey transform into golden bones—\nTheir Five Viscera[18] like polished gems, round and clear.\n\nOnly the Heavenly Unadulterated remains unstained and unattached,\nA single petal—how could it soil a robe?\nThus, in the mortal world, it neither grows nor is sown,\nHow could its five leaves bear fruit?\n\nGolden flowers, jade petals,\n*Huachi*[19] yellow sprouts—\nNo marvel blooms from a common body,\nYet through refining, it becomes the bone of the Immortal.\nThree flowers converge at the crown,\nNine breaths[20] coalesce into form—\nBy this praise and offering, they extend boundless support.\n\nThey present the Heavenly wonders of strange realms’ flowers:\n*Nine Spirits Supreme Marvelous True Flowers*,\n*Five Spirits Minor Marvelous Strange Flowers*,\n*Emerald Petals Golden Glow Flowers*,\n*Golden Petals Purple-Gold Radiant Flowers*,\n*Languan Gardens Azure Jade Orchid Flowers*,\n*Jade Forest Flowing Light Treasure Flowers*—\nTheir light dazzling, illuminating the Ten Directions,\nExtending boundless support.\n\nThe waters:\nBefore chaos was divided,\nThe Primordial Essence was but a single pitcher of sacred elixir—\n\nThe divine marvel is already complete,\nDispersed as nine refined elixirs of pure essence.\nHow few discern the sages’ wisdom,\nTo save the world, one must know depth and measure.\n\nIf one can taste the taste of flavors,\nOnly then does one perceive the pure of the pure.\nShould one drink three cups,\nNecessarily, the Great Dao will be understood.\n\nWith reverence, I present this offering,\nWishing its fragrance to be savored,\nGathering as the *yangchun*[21] of a full belly,\nScattering as the sweet dew of the heavens—\nPenetrating the Three Realms in speechless, laughterless harmony,\nMerging all things in one drunkenness, one awakening,\nStriking the *Bai Xue Huang E*[22] on the zither,\nRaising the cup to invite the Clear Wind and Bright Moon,\nRejoicing in the celestial realm within the vessel,\nRoaming the misty peaks beyond the world,\nEmulating *Dao Hongkai* in the pursuit of the Way,\nSeeking *Bai Yunzi* in the quest for True Reality—\nDivine elixirs of immortal alchemy,\nThe Great Saint’s Sacred Pill,\nHolding this sacred nectar,\nExtending boundless support.\n\nI present the Seven Heavenly Sacred Elixirs:\n*Solar Essence Elixir*,\n*Lunar Luster Elixir*,\n*Stellar Radiance Elixir*,\n*Sweet Dew Elixir*,\n*Golden Fluid Elixir*,\n*Spirit Light Elixir*,\n*Jade Vault Elixir*—\nDrinking them brings endlessness,\nCirculating through the Ten Directions,\nExtending boundless support.\n\n**Fruits:**\nFruits arise from flowers,\nTheir cultivation must be nurtured by planting.\n\nThe stillness of the heart gives birth to the Dao/Way,\nYet it must rely on the strength of cultivation and planting.\nThus there are the coiled peaches of *Zi Xiang*,\nAnd the fire dates of mingled hues,\nNearly taken from the self, distantly drawn from things.\n\nIf the heart-field’s purity is clear and bright,\nThen fruits flourish in abundance;\nOr if thorns and brambles grow thickly,\nThen roots and shoots wither away.\n\nTheir color like citrus, yet sweet as honey,\nSome ripen after years, others at their appointed time,\nSome take three thousand years to form,\nSome mature in an instant’s flash—\nChewing them, the spirit feels invigorated,\nSavoring them, the mind becomes lucid and clear.\n\nIf the fruit arises from its cause,\nThen one must discard the flower and focus on the essence.\nAt this moment, the mind is fully illuminated.\nThrough this praise, boundless support is extended.\n\nI offer the Seven Heavenly Sacred Fruits of *Qiónglín*:\nThe *Kōngdòng* spirit-gourd,\nThe *Wànsuì* immortal peach,\nThe *Jīnzhǐ* golden dates,\nThe *Yuánguāng* primal essence fruits,\nThe *Chìlíng* crimson spirit dates,\nThe *Fēidān* flying alchemy pomegranates—\nTheir fragrance thick and pervasive,\nEating them brings endlessness,\nCirculating through the Ten Directions,\nExtending boundless support.\n\n**Food:**\nHeavenly and human sustenance, bland and flavorless,\nRecorded in the *Huángtíng* scriptures;\nThe *Shūmǐ* millet grains,\nRefined without remainder, their merit marked in *Língbǎo*.\nThus the highest sages,\nOnly savor the *Chōnghé* balanced taste;\nWhile those descending to the mortal realm,\nIndulge in rich delicacies to repel demons.\n\nThe Four Heavenly Fragrant Rice of the celestial kitchen,\nBorn from the common folk’s grains;\nYet the world’s hundred varieties of rice and millet,\nEach kernel earned through toil and suffering.\n\nThose who enjoy blessings without laboring to eat,\nShould reflect on their origins;\nThose who have abundance yet know contentment,\nMust not cast it away lightly.\n\nIn this *Fǎhuì* assembly of sacred practice,\nI prepare the *Huìxiāo* fine offerings.\nThus I present these fragrant feasts,\nTo nourish the departed spirits.\n\nThrough this praise, boundless support is extended.\n\nI offer the Four Heavenly Fragrant Rices:\n*Fēngshān* Abundant Mountain Rice,\n*Lóngshān* Dragon Mountain Rice,\n*Qīngjīng* Verdant Essence Rice,\n*Tàihé* Grand Harmony Rice—\nTheir fragrance thick and pervasive,\nEating them brings endlessness,\nCirculating through the Ten Directions,\nExtending boundless support.\n\nThe *heart-flower* of wisdom’s fruit,\nThe *golden rice* and *jade nectar*,\nThe *Língbǎo* spirit’s fragrant wisdom,\nThe *pífēn* subtle dharma-flavors—\nAll rely on things to manifest the Dao/Way,\nYet one should perceive the mind through their form.\n\nEach should offer sincere and expansive devotion,\nTurning it into boundless merit.\nMay all beings on the great earth attain fullness,\nNo creature left unnourished by its essence.\n\nFurther, through fitting praise,\nTo complete the awakening.\n\nHearing the *Fǎnwèi* wisdom’s radiance in the *Tàiwú* boundless void,\nThe *round penetration* of all mysteries;\nRefining the true light within the dharma-body,\nSavoring the *Chōnghé* balanced taste.\n\nAble to draw sufficiency from all forms,\nInitially not dependent on external things.\n\nAfter the *spirit-food* incantation,\nI hope for your departed soul,\nTo absorb the *Língmáng* luminous essence of the inner landscape,\nTo steady the central *zhōngzhuàng* true position,\nTo drink the *Qióngguì* dewdrops of the spirit-tree,\nTo eat the *Huánghuá* golden petals’ jade-like tenderness,\nTo grasp the Dao’s profound mysteries,\nTo congeal the spirit in the boundless expanse,\nTo rest in the *yuánfáng* primal chamber and lie at ease,\nTo aid the true transformation in its boundless circulation.\n\nOffered to the departed,\nTo merit their rebirth in the heavenly realms.\nRecite the *Yùqīng Dàcí* Great Compassionate Sovereign’s *Gānlù* Nectar Law-Food Incantation:\n\nTurn back and gaze upon the *Yuánluó* round canopy,\nUniting the scene and drawing the luminous essence.\nConfining the soul, restraining the seven *pò*,\nFocusing the mind, centering the *zhōngzhuàng*.\nMoving, dwelling, walking in the boundless void,\nSleeping, resting in the *yuánfáng* primal chamber.\nHunger, feast on the *Huángbì* golden petals;\nThirst, drink the *Qiónggēn* dewdrop nectar.\nThe spirit-banners command the *tiān mó* heavenly demons,\nUniting the body, refining the true light.\nOnce more illuminating the *Tàiwú* boundless void,\nEndlessly dwelling in the mid-air realm.\nRound penetration fades at the *bōjí* wave’s edge,\nTrue transformation knows no final limit.\nProfound mysteries without beginning or end,\nThe practitioner must clearly understand.\nSilent and vast, forgetting teachings and precepts,\nResponding to the *yùn* cosmic flow, vast and unconstrained.\nThe Dao’s mirror does not shine by itself,\nIt must first be polished by what is offered.\nUnion finds no duality,\nSeparation follows the heart’s will.\n\nNow mingled in the *mángwèi* murky and luminous,\nTransformation not yet riding the single *qì* breath.\n\nTo reverse their original knowledge,\nForm must arise from the *sān guāng* Three Lights.\nAppropriate to sing and chant in the *qīngyáo* clear melodies,\nTo unfold the path of birth and rebirth.\n\nAfter the *spirit-food* incantation,\nI hope for your departed soul,\nTo embrace the *yīn* and cradle the *yáng*,\nTo draw the *rìyuè* sun-moon’s ascending *bēn* vital qi,\nTo mold the soul and cast the spirit,\nTo store the *kǎnlí* water-fire’s constructed essence.\nThe Three Palaces full and replete,\nThe Ten Aspects complete—\nEarly ascending to the *tōngdá* realm of boundless passage,\nEndlessly roaming the *zhìhuì* gate of wisdom.\n\nOffered to the departed,\nTo merit their rebirth in the heavenly realms.\nRecite the *Sānguāng* Three Lights Illuminating the Nectar Law-Food Incantation:\n\nVast and crystalline, the *yuángì* primal qi is born,\nPerfusing the *tàikōng* great void.\nThe two *yào* luminaries shine together,\nThe five *wéi* constellations harmonize in turn.\nThe Three Lights radiant, their brilliance complete,\nSacred qi fills the Three Palaces.\nThe imperial domain gathers the *jiǔlǎo* Nine Elders,\nFeasting on the *bǎitǐ* hundred forms of abundance.\nThe *Jīnhuá* golden petals illuminate the scene,\nBody aligned with the sun and moon.\nIn thought of the Dao, before the highest sages,\nEndless life through ten thousand kalpas.\nHeavenly beings nurture the people,\nAccumulating the *sānwānliùqiān* thirty-six thousand divine qi;\nThe world abandons the Great Dao/Way,\nDestroying the *yībǎiliùshí* one hundred and eighty spirit-gates.\nSelf-corruption damages the true roots,\nNo nourishment blooms in the jade tree.\nThe spirit does not grant itself,\nThe shadow wanders with demons.\n\nTo reverse the source of life,\nOne must rely on the *fàn* sacred chant.\nAfter the *spirit-food* incantation,\nI hope for your departed soul,\nTo obtain the *zhònghuà* myriad transformations’ primal essence,\nTo restore the five *shén* spirits’ true dwelling,\nThe *Bái Yuán* White Sovereign on the right as guardian,\nThe *Gōngzǐ* Prince on the left as support,\nThe crown adorned with the *fēicùi* floating emerald canopy,\nThe feet encircled by the *jīnlián* golden lotus.\nFragrant clouds enfold the body,\nSweet nectar sprinkles the heart,\nThe *zhànhuǎng* profound and elusive primal spirit,\nNourishing the *xīyí* subtle true qi.\n\nOffered to the departed,\nTo merit their rebirth in the heavenly realms.\nRecite the *Yùqīng Dàbēi* Great Compassion Cloud Palace’s *Yīnshēng* Dark Birth Incantation for the *Fànchàng* Sacred Chant and *Shēnghún* Soul-Bathing:\n\nThe cloud-root boundless, the myriad transformations’ essence,\nThe seven *pò* spirits congealed within,\nThe three *hún* souls inwardly knotted.\nThe *èrshí sì zhēn* Twenty-Four True Ones,\nEnter and exit without gate.\nThe profound and elusive essence,\nThe profound and elusive primal spirit.\nFollowing the *jié* kalpa’s rise and fall,\nBorn with the *qì* breath.\nInternally congealed in the *hùnpò* mixed simplicity,\nExternally nurtured by the seven *jīng* channels.\nThe five *shén* spirits planted in the *huá* petals,\nThe three *tái* platforms spread with luster.\nThe *zǐquè* purple gate and pristine *sùtóng* youth,\nReturning the soul to its *yuán* origin.\nAscending on clouds to become immortal,\nRanging through mists, floating in the void.\nWithin lies the *Yùjīng* Jade Capital,\nCalled the *shén gōng* Divine Palace.\nOn the right, the *wúyīng* peerless guardian,\nOn the left, the *Bái Yuán* White Sovereign’s support.\n\nThe dark beasts block the rear, the vermilion birds guard the front.\nAbove, they float beneath the emerald canopy, below, they tread the golden lotus.\nFragrant clouds condense in the void, sweet dew flows endlessly.\nUsing it, it is never exhausted; seeking it, it is never found.\n\nThe Nine Abysses of black darkness, where the Six Bandits are confined in iron prisons;\nA single thought of clarity, the Great Void knows no boundary.\n\nTo leisurely dwell in the True Realm,\nOne must savor the Great Harmony.\n\nFurther wield the **Treasure Scrolls** (*bǎozhāng*),\nTo uphold the strict **Dharma flavors** (*fǎwèi*).\n\nAfter the **spiritual meal** (*zòushí*), I hope for your departed soul (*wánglíng*),\nTo drink the sweet dew’s **falling mist** (*língmèng*), eternally purifying the heart’s defilements (*xīngòu*);\nTo ride the **Jade Sound’s** (*Yùyīn*) song and call, seated in divine wandering (*shényóu*).\n\nWhile the **feast and wine** (*yáojiǔ*) remain,\nThe Eight Extremes are traversed.\n\nOffered for the departed (*wángzhě*),\nTo ascend and nourish the **Pure Land of the Heavens** (*wǎngshēng tiānjiè*).\n\nRecite the **Nine Abysses Transcendent Sweet Dew Dharma-Meal Spell** (*Jiǔyōu chāoshēng gānlù fǎshí zhòu*):\n\nCold and flowing, the sweet dew nourishes,\nIts **Dharma flavor** (*fǎwèi*) beyond measure.\nLike **cyan-lined forests** (*piānlín*), it flows with seven treasures,\nForever banishing hunger and thirst.\n\nTo receive this **Dharma offering of food** (*fǎshí*),\nAscend to the heavens, entering the **Purple Chamber** (*Zǐfáng*).\n\nIts lingering essence brings cool relief,\nReaching all beings.\n\nThe **underworld’s** depths are iron-walled,\nBound by the **Iron Enclosure** (*tiěwéi*) of its firmness;\nThe **heavenly realm’s** vastness knows no ascent,\nNo **stages of rank** (*jiējí*) to climb.\n\nRelying on the **golden light of ten thousand Dao** (*wàndào jīnguāng*),\nBreaking the **Nine Yin paths** (*jiǔyīn quánlù*).\n\nAfter the **spiritual meal** (*zòushí*), I hope for your departed soul (*wánglíng*),\nThat **Great Stability** (*Tàidìng*) arises from heavenly light (*tiānguāng*),\nAnd **auspiciousness** (*jíxiáng*) is born in the **Void Chamber** (*xūshì*).\n\nThe **Jade Terrace’s** Twelve Residences (*Yùlóu shíèr*),\nClearing the **sore throat** (*sǎoyàn*) in the **Flower Pool** (*Huápíng*);\nThe **Earthly Pivot’s** Nine True Ones (*Níhuán jiǔzhēn*),\nSilently attending the **Supreme Deity** (*Shàngdì*).\n\nThis is the **path to ascension** (*shēngtiān jìnglù*),\nStretching the **auspicious light of breaking prison** (*pòyù zhāngshū*),\nReaching the **Extreme Heights of Bright Clarity** (*jǐ gāomíng*),\nAttaining **Great Freedom** (*Dàzìrài*).\n\nOffered for the departed (*wángzhě*),\nTo ascend and nourish the **Pure Land of the Heavens** (*wǎngshēng tiānjiè*).\n\nRecite the **Breaking Prison, Ascending to Heaven Spell** (*Pòyù shēngtiān zhòu*):\n\nVast and boundless within **Dingdu** (*Chéngdū*),\nLayered **Golden Mountain** (*Jīngāngshān*).\nThe **Spiritual Treasure’s** boundless light (*Língbǎo wúliàng guāng*),\nPiercingly illuminates the **Fiery Pool** (*Yánchí fán*).\n\nThe **Seven Ancestors’** departed souls (*Qīzǔ zhū yōuhún*),\nTheir bodies borne aloft by fragrant clouds.\n\nThe **Flowers of Green Lotus** (*Qīngliánhuā*) for **Stability** (*Dìnghuì*) and **Blessing** (*Yì*),\nAscending to eternal safety.\n\nThe **Three Lights** (*Sānguāng*) flow their essence,\nCongealing into the **Pierced True Body** (*Dòngzhēn tǐ*), returning to the **Great Void** (*Tàimáng*).\n\nDescending to the **Abyssal Palace** (*Yuāndiān gōng*),\nAscending to the **Peerless Realm** (*Wúhé xiāng*).\n\nThough the body may wander back,\nThe traces are forgotten in an instant.\n\nThe **Seven Treasures** congeal in purity,\nThe **Mixed Chaos** (*Hùndùn*) blooms with fragrant splendor.\n\nSwallowing the **Nine Qi of Clouds** (*Jiǔqì yún*),\nThis joy knows no end.\n\nPreviously proclaimed were the **Spiritual Treasure Scrolls** (*Língbǎo zhāngbào*),\nAll are the **Original

Land’s** simple, correct flavors (*dànpō zhèngwèi*),\nAll beauties following in suit;\nObtain the **Pierced True Essence** (*Huǎnghuò yuánjīng*),\nEternal life without death.\n\nStill, I pass on the remaining blessings (*yúqìng*),\nBestowing **longevity’s** lingering traces (*chóngshōu miǎocún*),\nAscending to the **Round Canopy** (*Yuángǎi*),\nDescending to the **Square Realm** (*Fāngyú*),\nAll

**underworld paths** (*mínglù*).\nThose who eat are sated,\nFree from all hardships.\n\nThe **Great Dao’s** compassion,\nGuides them back to the **Immortal Path** (*xiānlù*).\n\n**Dao Gate’s** universal teachings—\nMust use **Volume Five** of the **Collected Scrolls** (*jíjuàn*).\n**Dao Gate’s** universal teachings—\nMust use **Volume Six** of the **Collected Scrolls** (*jíjuàn*).\n\n**Master Lü Taigu of the Crane Forest Daoist School’s *Reading and Guidance* Section**\n*Preface to the *Praise of the Guidance Rites* by Master Guangcheng*\n\nThe scriptures refer to **\"fasting officials\"** (*zhāiguān*) within the **ritual assembly**—those who practice the Dao of fasting. Today, this is mistakenly called the **\"fasting master.\"**\n\nThose of highest **virtue/power** (*dé*) and **Dao** are called **Lawmasters** (*Fǎshī*), equivalent to **High Functionaries** (*gāogōng*). Those well-versed in **ritual precepts** (*fǎdù*) serve as **Chief Lecturers** (*dūjiǎng*), responsible for chanting, guiding, and upholding the **rites and regulations**. To ensure the **officers** stand in order and the **ritual formations** stand solemn, the **drum and bell** must first be struck. Only then may the assembly gather, and the **Chief Lecturer** ascend the platform to chant.\n\nIf the **Chief Lecturer**’s years of **virtue/power** are slightly greater and they wish to avoid excessive labor, one may be appointed from among the officers to strike the bell and lead the rites. Though this practice arose from necessity, it is not the ancient custom. Now that the bell is established as fixed ritual, it has endured for long.\n\nAncient rites were simple, but modern rituals have grown elaborate. The **High Functionary** and **Lawmaster** lead the **supplications**, their bows and movements setting the example for the assembly. If they are aged or infirm, they may retire of their own accord—never should they be replaced by another, lest it appear as redundant office.\n\nThe **Supervisor of the Fasting** (*Jiānzhāi*) upholds the **ritual statutes** (*kēxiàn*) and corrects transgressions. If any offense occurs, they must first warn with a **penalty register**. Those punished must accept their guilt without grumbling, lest disputes arise during **ritual admonition**, bringing shame upon the assembly.\n\nThe **Divine Sage’s Attendant** (*Xuánshèng shìjīng*) oversees the **platform** (*tánchǎng*), arranging the **ritual seating** and ensuring all **offerings** are properly prepared. According to ancient practice, within the **fasting hall**—today’s **platform**—two high seats are placed for **morning, noon, and evening lectures**. Those who have mastered the scriptures below the **Lawmaster** may request to ascend the **Law Seat**.\n\nWhen the **scripture recitation** begins, once the officers are seated, one performs **purification**, while the **Incense Attendant** tends the incense and the **Scripture Attendant** holds the scripture. After recitation, the scripture must be carefully stored in the **fasting hall**, held in strict **veneration**, lest the tables be left disordered, the platform defiled, or outsiders trespass, lightly profaning the **Divine Worthies**.\n\nThe **Incense Attendant’s** duties are detailed in the **ritual register**, yet many today neglect them through laxity. The **Lamp Attendant** must diligently maintain the lamps—extinguishing and relighting them as needed—this alone fulfills their role. Recently, some unqualified individuals have excluded the **Scripture Attendant** from arranging the **platform**, instead establishing a **\"Direct Platform\"** (*zhítán*) title. Today’s **Direct Platform** is what was once the **Scripture Attendant’s** duty.\n\nBeyond the **six primary roles**, there are many redundant positions. This stems from **Sichuan’s** addition of **external platform rituals** beyond the ancient rites, which the officers did not originally perform. Due to neglect, the **three attendants** were made to also **recite repentance verses** and serve the **external platform**, leaving the **Scripture Attendant, Incense Attendant, and Lamp Attendant** unfulfilled in their own duties. Though divided among them, they must still wear **ritual attire** when performing **ritual duties**. This should be examined to align with proper **rites and regulations**.\n\nAccording to the **Golden Register’s** ancient rites and the **Yellow Register’s** old laws, on the **night of the vigil** and during **meritorious recitation**, one first performs the **Natural Morning Rites**—that is, **paying homage to the Ten Directions** and offering **three repentances**. Only then does the ritual proceed.\n\nThus, the **fasting ritual sequence** begins at **hour *xū*** (7–9 PM), when the officers are summoned before the **Mysterious Teacher** (*Xuánshī*). One reads the **office statement**, then casts the **petition** onto the **main platform**, offers incense to the **Ten Directions**, ascends to the **inner altar**, offers incense, pays homage to the **Teacher**, lights the **incense burner**, and bows in **morning reverence**. Next, the **fasting petition** is read, followed by the **Great Thanksgiving** and the **proclamation of precepts**. The **Chief Lecturer**, having received their office, recites the **scriptural prohibitions**, makes a **vow**, relights the burner, and returns to stand before the **Mysterious Teacher** once more.\n\nHence it is said: *\"At dawn’s first light, proceed according to the Dao’s law.\"* This method, transmitted from **Zhang Daoling**, **Lu Jianji**, **Kou Qingzhi**, and **Zhang Qingdu**, has endured through the ages, always maintaining that the **fasting rites** originate from the **Natural Morning Rites**, lest the source be forgotten.\n\nRecently, some mediocre scholars, failing to grasp the intent of the ancients, have **prematurely appointed the six offices** before the **Mysterious Teacher**, proclaiming the **scriptural prohibitions** before ascending the platform, then claiming that **Lu Jianji’s fasting rites** are erroneous. Their false praise and slander only serve to confuse—how little they know! Even their followers imitate this, not only disrupting the **ritual order** but also slandering the **worthy teachers**. Those who understand the **Dao’s teachings** should reject them.\n\n**Du Guangting of the Eastern Isles** writes: Examining ancient rites, there is no **\"incense blessing\"** (*zhùxiāng*), **\"courtly attendance\"** (*tíngcān*), or **\"proclamation of supplications.\"** When **Yang Xue**, the **Master of Letters**, revised the **Golden Register rites**, he included an **\"incense blessing\"**—this was the **official Daoist assembly’s** fixed order. After offering incense and bowing, a **declared Daoist** would state the **fasting intent**, then retire to stand before the **Mysterious Teacher** to assume their office. Today, during **ritual exorcisms**, the **High Functionary** performs the **incense blessing**.\n\nAncient rites were not without **spirit invocation**—this was the **vigil night**. Hence, **Master Guangcheng** repeatedly expounds upon it. Therefore, the **appointment of offices** and **proclamation of precepts** must follow the **recitation of petitions**, first informing the **Highest Truths** of the **fasting intent**—this is not the time for **descending blessings** or **offering libations**.\n\nSince **Master Wu Ruo** composed the *Critique of Errors*, he favored his own views, claiming: *\"How could one appoint offices and proclaim precepts only after the sacrificial rites conclude?\"* **Yang Xue**, following **Wu Ruo’s** mistake, moved the **appointment of offices** and **proclamation of precepts** to before the **ritual invocation**, greatly deviating from the intent of all past **lineage masters**.\n\nNow we have **spirit invocation**, **vigil night rites**, and **initial platform announcements** outside the platform—this is like **building a house beneath a house and a roof above a roof**. Though practiced for long, it is difficult to alter. At least, one might eliminate the **vigil night invocation** and the **three-day morning announcements**, which would be somewhat acceptable.\n\n「With reverence, I adopt the ritual sequences established by **Master Guangcheng**, **Yang Xue the Scholar**, and **Master Sun the Teacher**, cross-referencing them with ancient rites, compiling the *Praise of the Dao*, and adapting past traditions to present needs—all to aid the Dao’s transformation.\n\nFor the **Daoist common teachings**, the sixth and seventh volumes of the *Collected Scriptures* must be used.\nThe **Daoist common teachings** also require the *Crane Forest Collection* of **Lü Taigu the Daoist**, particularly the **\"Wēiyí Rites\"** (*Wēiyí Yì*) and **\"Ordinating the Platform Rites\"** (*Qìngtán Yì*), alongside the three concordant editions of **Du the Celestial Master**, **Yang Zigong** (次公), and **Zhang Wujin** (无尽).\n\nIn general, when the platform faces due north, the **Grand Invocation** (*Dūjiǎng*) should be performed at the **door of the platform** (*dìhù*), meaning the **platform exterior**—this is the **platform’s outer precinct** (*tánwài*). **Celestial Master Zhang Wanfu**’s preface to the *Ritual Procedures* (*Xùshì Yì*) includes a diagram of the platform, designating the **Grand Invocation** (*Dūjiǎng*) as the **Wēiyí Invocation** (*Wēiyí Jiǎng*), implying that all **Wēiyí rites** within a single platform are led by the **Grand Invocation**. Thus, the **ordination of the platform** should be conducted by the **Grand Invocation** alone.\n\nHowever, **Yang Zigong** (杨杰次公) states: *\"Appoint a Daoist of Wēiyí rank to ordain the platform.\"* This fails to recognize that the **Grand Invocation** itself is the **Wēiyí**. He further says: *\"Place the **Jian Water** (*Jiànshuǐ*) at the **door of the platform** (*dìhù*).\"* This overlooks the fact that the **Grand Invocation**’s designated position is already the **door of the platform**. If the platform does not face due north, it should be relocated accordingly.\n\n**White Invocation** (*Bái Shì*) and **spirit contemplation** (*Cúnxiǎng*) are to be performed.\n\n**Celestial Master Du** states: *\"The Wēiyí Master, wearing the **mystic cap** (*Xuánguān*) and **crimson robe** (*Zhànghè*), stands at the **door of the platform**, and the **White Invocation** (*Bái Shì*) is performed to present the received **scriptures and ordination credentials** (*Jīngzhuó*) for the **appointment of offices** (*Zhìzhí*).\"*\n\nI, **Subject [Name]**, humbly hear that none surpasses the **hundred spirits** (*bǎilíng*) in harmonizing **yin and yang** (*Yùnyáng*); yet none can equal the **Great Dao** (*Dàdào*) in **saving the realm and the family** (*Jìjiāguó*) or **communing with the luminous and the dark** (*Yōumíng*).\n\nThus, the **Jade Hall** (*Bìluò*) undergoes transformations of calamity and fortune, which may be dispelled; the **Yellow Register** (*Huánglù*) contains rites of deliverance, permitting their observance and practice. Your subjects, humbly emulating the **True Transformation** (*Zhēnhuà*), though unworthy, hold official rank. In all places traversed, how dare we forget to repay with devotion?\n\nNow, we petition to construct a certain **ritual hall** (*zhāi*) at [location], for a span of [number] days and nights, performing **Dao rituals** (*xíngdào*) and **scripture-turning** (*zhuǎnjīng*), in accordance with the prescribed rites. Your subjects, refining our **form and qi** (*xíngqì*), purifying our **spirit and vitality** (*jīngshén*), shall diligently execute this, daring not to fail in reporting upward.\n\nWe humbly await the **Most High’s** (*Tàishàng*) proclamation of new decrees, the boundless grace of **covering and nurturing** (*fùyù*), commanding the **True Officials** (*Zhēnguān*) to oversee and descend in judgment. May the mists and clouds briefly cease at the **Three Canopies** (*Sānjǐng*), and winds and rains not assail the **Four Seas** (*Sìméng*). Our **confessions** (*chuànxiè*) shall surely be heard, and our petitions transmitted without obstruction. Your subjects, overwhelmed by such boundless grace, focus our thoughts on the **True One** (*Zhēn*), awaiting the response.\n\nAs **Master Yang** originally stated: Before the **White Invocation** (*Bái Shì*), first contemplate the **Three Masters** (*Sānshī*) in the west—then the **Three True Lords of Tang, Ge, and Zhou** (*Táng-Gě-Zhōu Sān Zhēnjūn*) before you. **Lord Tang** (*Tángjūn*), of **Júyáng**, with **celestial-crown** (*Tiānguān*) and **red scripture-register** (*Zhàngzhāng dān yī*), wields the **Dragon-Headed Treasure Sword** (*Lóngtóu Bǎojiàn*), his left hand holding a **talisman**. **Lord Ge** (*Gējūn*), clad in ritual attire, holds a **jade spear**. **Lord Zhou** (*Zhōujūn*), in his **crown and robes**, wields the **Jade Yang Node**. Next, contemplate the **True Official** (*Zhēnguān*) in **crimson robes**, riding the **Nine-Phoenix Chariot** (*Jiǔfèng Chéng*) and the **Big Dipper**, descending to purify the defilements at the altar. Then, contemplate the **Seven Stars** covering your head with their handles pointing forward, lest they obstruct your vision.\n\nOnly then proceed with the **White Invocation**—though it is better to first contemplate the **Four Spirits** (*Sìlíng*) at your left, right, front, and rear, with the **Sun, Moon, and Five Stars** (*Rìyuè Wǔxīng*) above your head. This is from **Du Yi’s** method.\n\nUpon completing contemplation, pass the **tablet** (*jiǎn*) to the attendant. Next, **clasp the fist** (*wògù*), hands hanging naturally, and summon the **Four Spirits**.\n\n**Clasping the fist**: With the **thumb pressing the middle finger’s middle joint**, the other four fingers drawn into the palm.\n\n**Eastern Azure Dragon** (*Dōngfāng Qīnglóng*), essence of the **Horn and Kneecap** (*Jiǎo-Kàng*), exhales **clouds and suppressed qi**, roars with **thunderous voice**. Soaring through the **Eight Extremes** (*Bājí*), circling the **Four Seas**, come stand at my left.\n\n**Western White Tiger** (*Xīfāng Báihǔ*), corresponding to **Zīshēn**, its **pure essence** and **solemn tones** awe birds and beasts, its howls stirring mountains and forests—come stand at my right.\n\n**Southern Vermilion Bird** (*Nánfāng Zhūquè*), leader of all birds, born from the **Crimson Cavern**, its **azure sky echoes** resounding with **five-colored splendor** and **six symbolic forms**—come guide me before.\n\n**Northern Dark Tortoise** (*Běifāng Xuánwǔ*), born of **Great Yin**, its **void and perilous essence**, **turtle and serpent** merged—circling the **Nine Terrains**, commanding all spirits—come follow me behind.\n\nNext, **both hands pressed to the heart**, feet stepping into the **Ding-character stance**. Having summoned the Four Spirits, they shall now **circle like a belt**, the **Sun clasped by the Moon** in motion.\n\nThe **Sixteen Divine Generals of the Nine Regions** (*Jiǔzhōu Shíliù Shénjiāng*) serve as my emissaries. Under the **Great Unity Star Lord** (*Tàiyī Xīngjūn*), there are sixteen divine generals who know the **calamities and blessings of the world**. Some, unacquainted with this, mistakenly alter it to **sixty divine generals**. The **Heaven, Earth, and Water Officials** (*Tiāndì Shuǐguān*) share their auspiciousness.\n\nThe characters **Heaven, Earth, Water** (*Tiān-Dì-Shuǐ*) are stepped as **Ding, Gāng, and Sān Cái** (*Sāncái bù*), at the **sword-water** (*jiànshuǐ*), invoking **Yang Yi’s** method. The old rites speak of **Heaven, Earth, and Water Officials**, but **Yang’s** version is superior.\n\nNext, the **right hand grasps the sword**. The **Five Phases** (*Wǔxíng*)—**Fire, Wood, Water, Earth, Metal**—are in motion. My **rigid sword** commands and restrains **ghosts and spirits**. The **Twenty-Eight Constellations** (*Èrshíbāxiù*) array before my will. The **Seven Stars of the Big Dipper** (*Běidǒu Qīxīng*) flank and assist the **Numinous True One**. Circling the ten thousand directions, all blessings converge.\n\nNext, the **left hand holds the water vessel** (*shuǐkuàng*). The **Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Sea rivers** are not **Divine Water** (*Shénshuǐ*); **Divine Water** refers to **cauldron-water** (*zhuóshuǐ*), while those rivers are **mundane**. Some mistakenly alter this to **mundane water**, an error in their sight.\n\nThe **Five Dragons** exhale to purify **Heaven and Earth**. The **Great Emperor** (*Dàdì*) has worn it for ten thousand years; today, I shall cleanse the **demonic qi**.\n\nFacing the **sword and water**, chant the incantation:\n*\"With reverence, I summon the **Eastern Azure Dragon** (*Dōngfāng Qīnglóng*), bearing talisman and sword, descending **True Qi** into my water. The **Southern Vermilion Dragon** (*Nánfāng Zhīlóng*), bearing talisman and sword, descending **True Qi** into my water. The **Western White Dragon** (*Xīfāng Báihǔ*), bearing talisman and sword, descending **True Qi** into my water. The **Northern Black Dragon** (*Běifāng Hēilóng*), bearing talisman and sword, descending **True Qi** into my water. The **Central Yellow Dragon** (*Zhōngyāng Huánglóng*), bearing talisman and sword, descending **True Qi** into my water.*\n\n*My water is no ordinary water—it is the **Five Dragons’ and Five Stars’ True Qi Water**. My sword is no ordinary blade—**nine-fold refined**, its rigidity unyielding, the **Seven Stars** flanking it, **treading the Big Dipper**, **straddling the Arc of the General** (*Kuaì Gāng*). The **Great Unity** (*Tàiyī*) forms the **water character**; the **crossbar** (*gāng*) is also written as **‘action’** (*zuò*). **Yang’s** version uses **‘in’** (*zài*), which is superior.*\n\n*Circling the ten thousand directions—three versions omit the lines ‘spraying water upon Heaven’ and ‘sprinkling water upon Earth.’ Water cleanses beyond measure; filth cannot surpass impurity. With purity, impurity is dispelled; with water, defilement is governed. There are no lines about ‘hurrying to depart ten thousand li’ or ‘not stopping.’*\n\n*Urgent, as the **Law decrees** (*Lǜlìng*), commanding restraint.*\n\n*Facing the **Break** (*Pò*)—as in **Yang’s** version—when the **Dipper’s Handle** (*Dǒugǎng*) points straight, its direction is **Break**. Though the altar’s orientation may be inconvenient, mental contemplation suffices.*\n\nNext, proceed to the **southwest**, reciting the **Purification of Heaven and Earth Cauldron** (*Jìng Tiāndì Zhòu*):\n*\"The **Void of the Cavern** (*Dòngzhōng Xuánxū*), the **Gleaming Primordial** (*Huàngyào Tàiyuán*).

– A Ritual Invocation*\n\n**Ritual Invocation (发奏):**\nWithout first announcing to the Earth and Land deities (*告土地*), the adept proceeds to the **outer altar** (*外坛*) and performs the **host’s preliminary rites** (*宿启*). Later generations expanded these rites with formal compositions, reducing them to mere announcements and the placement of written petitions (*寻置文牒*).\n\nFor those who practice the ritual while seated in the **Master’s position** (*师位*), additional **seals, incantations, and talismans** (*印诀符咒*) are employed, summoning the Earth and Land deities (*土地诸神*)—this tradition stems from the *Heavenly Heart Orthodoxy* (*天心正法*).\n\nNow, this has become established practice: once the deities are seated, the adept must **invoke the talismans for divine transformation** (*如法文变神搯诀*) in accordance with the prescribed rites before proceeding.\n\nAs recorded at the beginning of this section:\n**Ritual Invocation (发奏):**\nThe adept arranges the Earth and Land deities (*土地等神*) at the **Celestial Gate** (*天门*), and the **Daoist Master** (*法师*) sits at the **southeast corner** (*东南隅*).\n\nUpon taking his seat, the Master first **harmonizes his own person** (*存己身*), donning the **Fish-Tail Crown** (*鱼尾冠*), wrapping himself in the **Fish-Mane Robe** (*鱼鬣衣*), and wearing **crimson shoes** (*朱履*), as prescribed by the **Celestial Master** (*天师*).\n\nThen, he performs the **talismans for divine transformation** (*搯变神诀*):\nWith the **left hand’s ring finger** (*左手小指*), he curves it backward from the **fourth finger** (*四指*), bending it into the **root of the middle finger** (*中指根*). The **fourth finger** (*四指*) is curled inward toward the **palm** (*掌心*), while the **middle finger** (*中指*) hooks and secures the **ring finger** (*小指*). The **thumb** (*大指*) then presses against the **middle joint of the middle finger** (*中指中节*). After releasing the **thumb** (*弹了大指*), he presses the **root of the second finger** (*第二指根*).\n\nThis is the **original Master’s seal and talisman** (*本师印诀*), invoking the **Six Jia and Six Ding** (*六甲六丁*), the **Four Celestial Gate Kings** (*四天门王*), the **Azure Dragon and White Tiger** (*青龙白虎*), and the **Vermilion Bird and Dark Tortoise** (*朱雀玄武*), arrayed in concentric ranks around him. Next, he invokes the **Earth and Land officials** (*土、地申奏官属*), who stand at the **Celestial Gate** (*天门*) awaiting command, each distinctly recognized.\n\nAfterward, he **proclaims the summons** (*宣召*), directing them with his intent (*入意指挥*), and concludes with the **dismissal and farewell invocation** (*发引遣表*).\n\nThe Master, with his **left hand forming the talisman** (*搯印诀*), raises his **two fingers** (*二指*) to summon the scripture. With his **right hand wielding the Threefold Fire** (*仗三昧火*), he strikes the **roots of his four fingers** (*四指根节*) and recites the **Sword-Water Incantation** (*剑水咒*). Upon finishing the incantation (*噀水讫*), he **plants the sword** (*卓剑*).\n\nAt the **right side of his seat** (*坐右*), he forms the **Sword Talisman** (*卓剑诀*), striking the **root of his middle finger** (*右手中指根节*) toward the sword. Next, he **burns incense** (*焚香*), repeating the earlier **talisman for divine transformation** (*仍搯前变神诀*), visualizing the **Three Platform Stars** (*三台星*) upon the **back of his thumb** (*大指背*), known as the **Seven-Star Talisman** (*七星诀*).\n\nAfter reciting the scripture and proclaiming the petitions (*念文宣牒讫*), he **dismisses the deities with incantations** (*遣牒诵咒*), invoking the **True Qi of the Great Sun** (*太阳赤气*), the **True Qi of the Great Moon** (*太阴白气*), and the **Three Platform Seven-Star True Qi** (*三台七星真气*), channeling them into the water (*流注水中*), and **drawing the qi with the sword** (*执剑取气*).\n\nUpon finishing the incantation (*噀水讫*), the Master **directs his tongue to the upper palate** (*以舌主上腭*), transforming it into a **Golden Bridge** (*化为金桥*), allowing the Earth and Land officials to **deliver their petitions directly to the Celestial Gate** (*令土地申奏，从桥上径达天门*).\n\nWhen the ritual is complete (*事讫*), he **restores the deities and offers repentance** (*还神回向*).\n\nExtracted from the *Heavenly Heart Orthodoxy* (*天心正法*), recorded as *White Announcement of the Deities* (*白事*).»\n\nThe **Master of Qingdu Dao**, Zhang Wanfu, states:\n\n*\"The Daoist ritual of fasting is strict and exacting; all celestial deities and sages descend to observe. Every matter must conform to proper ritual standards, without neglecting or abandoning the prescribed rites and procedures.\"*\n\nThe **Great Cavern Master**, Xie Fanglai, further says:\n\n*\"When performing high-level petitionary rites, one must face east and stand upright. Below the rank of *Dujian* (都讲), all should face west to form a single rank. Standing upright, holding the tally tablet and bowing respectfully, one must regulate one’s breath and steady one’s *qi*, speak in measured, modest words, and maintain simplicity in ritual language. One must not raise one’s voice harshly, nor indulge in excessive ornamentation. Words should be concise, and meaning must be clear—avoid artificial embellishments, lest sincerity be lost.\"*\n\n*\"In all supplications, one must first repent of one’s transgressions before reporting the matter.\"*\n\nZhang Wanfu again says:\n\n*\"When ascending the platform to practice the Dao, one must first purify with incense and water, known as *Dangji* (荡秽). To draw forth and seal the *qi*, one must also purify, known as *Bizhenqi* (闭真气). When ascending the platform, one must strictly follow the ritual procedures established by the two Masters Zhang and Du. Before performing any rites, one must first go before the **Mysterious Master** (*玄师*), arrange the ranks, and chant the Dao. Upon reaching the platform’s entrance, one must hold the incantation and circle counterclockwise before ascending the **Celestial Gate** (*天门*) and offering incense to the Ten Directions. Then, one proceeds to the uppermost rank and performs the rites there—never omitting the proper announcement at the base of the platform, for such an omission is unknown in the original traditions and deviates from their intent.*\n\n*\"Indeed, from the **Ritual Master** (*礼师*), the **Qi-Storing Master** (*存神*), and the **Furnace-Opening Master** (*发炉*), all are meant to harmonize the inner and outer *qi*. Only after the **Spirit Official** (*灵官*)’s solemn rites are completed does one then invoke the **Daoist rank** (*法位*) and petition the **True Saints** (*诸真圣*). The logic of the announcement is clear and direct—omitting the base-platform announcement leaves no room for doubt or confusion.*\n\n**Nighttime Entrance Incantation** (*夜入户咒*):\n*\"Standing to the left of the earthly entrance, thrice strike the teeth in reverence, and in secret invoke the **Four Bright Officials** (*四明功曹*), the **Dragon-Tiger Envoys** (*龙虎使者*), the **True One Originating Qi** (*正一生气*), and the **Attendant Pure Maiden** (*侍靖素女*). If there are matters to be reported at night, I pray for the **Open-Mind Child** (*开明童子*) and the **Upper Primordial Maiden** (*上元少女*) to accompany me into the hall and platform, conveying my petitions so that they may be heard above.\"*\n\n**Nighttime Exit Incantation** (*夜出户咒*):\n*\"Exit the **Great Cavern** (*大洞*), ascending the **Great Yin** (*太阴*), the eight windows of illumination open, and all that has been presented is conveyed by the Pure Maiden.\"*\n\n*\"After the rites are finished, return to one’s proper station, and all the deities retreat in solemn rest. In the morning, the **Entrance Incantation** (*入户咒*) is:*\n*'Four Bright Officials, the **Pure Truth Envoys** (*通真使者*), the **Jade-Tongued Youth** (*传言玉童*), and the **Attendant Pure Maiden**, I pray that you convey my petitions to the **True Deities** (*正神*) of the hall and platform, the **Primordial Originating Qi** (*上元生气*), and that they descend into my body.'*\n\n**Morning Exit Incantation** (*朝出户咒*):\n*'Exit the **Great Yin** and enter the **Great Yang** (*出阴入阳*), and all the deities are opened and communicated.'\"*\n\nExtracted from the *Heavenly Heart Orthodoxy* (*天心正法*), recorded as *White Announcement of the Deities* (*白事*).\n\nAfter the rites are completed, the **Yellow Chamber** is closed. The **Attendant Pure Maiden** (*侍靖玉女*) stands vigilant in the sacred hall.\n\nFrom the *Clarified Truth Rites* (*明真科*) of **Lu Tian师**, preserved by **Jianji Lu Tian师**:\n\n*\"The Dao begins with fasting; fasting begins with scripture. In observing fasting rites, one must first focus the mind with precision. In honoring the scriptures’ authority, one must ground oneself in stillness of thought. If the foundation is not upright, the ritual decorum will falter, failing to align with the scriptures—how then could one invoke the Mysterious Saints and attain virtue and wisdom? Drawing from myriad scriptures, I have marked their essential truths, following the ancestral traditions to aid practitioners.\n\nHere is the **Essential Method for Concentrated Dao Practice and Spirit-Nurturing** (*道法精思存神诀*). Each practitioner must observe the teacher’s presence in accordance with the method.\n\nStand upright, close the eyes, and focus the spirit.\n\nFirst, focus on the **Three Supreme Sovereigns** (*太上三尊*), seated upon the **Celestial Treasure Platform** (*天宝台*). To their left stand the **Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures** (*三十六部尊经*), and to their right, the **Grand Master of the Mysterious Middle** (*玄中大法师*), the **Ten True Ones and Five Emperors** (*十真五帝*), with the assembled immortals and celestial attendants arrayed as in a grand court audience.\n\nNext, focus on the **Scripture Master’s** presence, bowing inwardly three times, honoring the master’s lineage. Then focus on the **Transmission Master’s** presence, bowing inwardly three times, honoring the master’s lineage. Then focus on the **Initiation Master’s** presence, bowing inwardly three times, honoring one’s own lineage.\n\nMay my three masters ascend to the heights of the immortals, opening the way for my seven ancestral parents to swiftly attain the Celestial Hall, and may my name be inscribed among the immortals, forever as a **True Person** (*真人*).\n\nAt dawn, the **Yin Hour** (*寅时*), visualize **Green Qi** (*青气*) rising from the liver, ascending like clouds, encircling the altar hall. The **Azure Dragon** and **Lion** guard the fore and aft.\n\nThe **Celestial and Earthly Immortals**, **Heavenly Maidens and Jade Boys**, the **Solar, Lunar, and Stellar Hosts**, the **Five Emperors’ Armies**, each numbering ninety million, along with the **Supervising Officials of the Fast** and the **Three Realms’ Attendants**, array themselves on either side, enveloping the disciple’s dwelling—great and small—with cloud-mist.\n\nAt noon, the **Yang Hour** (*午时*), visualize **Red Qi** (*赤气*) rising from the heart, ascending like clouds, raining down upon the altar hall. The **Vermilion Bird** and **White Crane** guard the fore and aft.\n\nThe **Celestial and Earthly Immortals**, **Heavenly Maidens and Jade Boys**, the **Solar, Lunar, and Stellar Hosts**, the **Five Emperors’ Armies**, the **Supervising Officials of the Fast**, and the **Three Realms’ Attendants** array themselves on either side, enveloping the disciple’s dwelling—great and small—with cloud-mist.\n\nAt nightfall, the **Hai Hour** (*戌时*), visualize **White Qi** (*白气*) rising from the lungs, ascending like clouds, encircling the altar hall. The **White Tiger** and **Qilin** guard the four quarters.\n\nThe **Celestial and Earthly Immortals**, **Heavenly Maidens and Jade Boys**, the **Solar, Lunar, and Stellar Hosts**, the **Five Emperors’ Armies**, the **Supervising Officials of the Fast**, and the **Three Realms’ Attendants** array themselves on either side, enveloping the disciple’s dwelling—great and small—with cloud-mist.\n\nFurther, visualize the **Five Stars**, **Five Sacred Peaks**, and **Five Emperors** guarding one’s form. The **Five Zang Qi** ascend in radiant disorder, crowning the body like mist, as if enshrouded in vapor. A **Golden Radiance** (*金华*) crowns the head, transforming the body into gold, first emerging from the lungs, with a round luminous orb atop the crown—like the sun’s symbol—illuminating the ten directions. Within the body, all is clear, both inner and outer, fully revealed.\n\nThen, practice the **Mysterious Observations**, penetrating the **Void and Profound**. This method is to be employed day and night, at the three critical hours.\"\n\nNext, strike the **Law Drum** twenty-four times. The **Law Drum**—by gathering inner **qi** and aweing external spirits—is the first act of ritual. When striking the door’s upper and lower beams in rhythm, this is called the **Law Drum**. After every eight strikes, pause briefly, symbolizing the twenty-four **qi** phases of the cosmos.\n\nMaster Wanfu of the Celestial Masters said: *\"The scriptures state that the Law Drum has three methods. First, strike silently without sound; second, strike so that it is heard; third, strike with an open mouth and relaxed cheeks, producing a deep, resonant sound—this is the method of self-cultivation. If the ritual assembly is large and noisy, striking silently is best, for then one’s mind may focus with precision, and the **qi** remains tranquil.\"*\n\nThe above method of **mindful striking** is recorded in the *Treatise on Natural Etiquette* and the *Golden Talisman Simplified Texts*.\n\nAccording to the **refined contemplation** decreed by Master Lu, now called **\"commanding demons through visualization\"**—this is specifically for **Stepping Through the Void** (*bùxū*). Since **Stepping Through the Void** follows **commanding demons**, one first visualizes, then commands the demons, and proceeds to **Stepping Through the Void**. Indeed, all matters within **Stepping Through the Void** align with the *Jade Capital Stepping Through the Void Scripture*, hence the reliance on Master Lu’s teachings, detailed here.\n\n**Refined Contemplation for Stepping Through the Void**\nMaster Lu said: *\"When reciting the Stepping Through the Void Scripture, first strike the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, and visualize the sun and moon upon your face. Let them enter through your nostrils into the Golden Flower Palace of the Inner Chamber, their radiance emerging from the nape, forming a nine-colored circular luminosity that descends into the Jade Pillow, illuminating the ten directions. As you circle the scripture in rotation, complete the practice, then strike the teeth three times and swallow saliva three times.\"*\n\n*(Excerpted from the *Supreme Jade Scripture’s Hidden Commentary*)*\n*The explanation of this method is also by Master Lu.*\n\n**Refined Contemplation for Stepping Through the Void** *(continued)*\n\n*\"Visualize the sun and moon upon your own face. The sun’s hue is red, with a purple radiance of nine rays. The moon’s hue is yellow, with a white radiance of ten rays. The sun stands to your left, the moon to your right, nine chi distant from your face. The sun’s rays descend straight from the left, entering through the left nostril. The moon’s rays descend straight from the right, entering through the right nostril. Together, they penetrate into the Golden Flower Palace of the Inner Chamber. The Golden Flower Palace is the point five cun directly inward from between the brows. Their radiance then descends into the Jade Pillow, emerging from the nape. The entire head is called the Níhuán Palace; one cun inward from the brows is the Míngtáng Palace, two cun the Dòngfáng Palace, three cun the Dāntián Palace, four cun the Liúzhū Palace, and five cun the Jīnhuá Palace—also known as the Inner Chamber of the Female Golden Flower. It is also called the Palace of the Jade Emperor, each palace being one cun in depth, thus forming the Níhuán Dòngmíng Mirror, which completes the likeness of the Golden Flower Immortal. Once the visualization is complete, then recite the verses of the Stepping Through the Void Scripture.*\n\n*According to Master Dù’s established ritual, the Daoist Master of Exorcism is stationed at the Ghost Gate, facing west. The Grand Master is stationed at the Heavenly Gate, facing east, and each chants while visualizing the nine-colored circular luminosity and swallowing saliva to invoke the secret exorcism spells. From the High Functionary downward, each performs the visualization in turn. Since Master Yáng’s establishment of the Golden Talisman Ritual, the Master of Exorcism has been stationed at the Heavenly Gate. Now, no further changes are made; instead, each follows the prescribed method as recorded in the scripture. The Exorcism Spell reads:*\n\n*'Huángzhōng cè qì zhǎn yāo zōng,*\n*Chá zhì qiáng jīng duàn xié wēng.*\n*Tàishàng yǒu mìng Tàishàng fáng,*\n*jí chào běi dì yì yù gōng.*\n*Shòu chéng wēi lìng xuān máo wáng,*\n*wǔ qì wěng yù yǔ mìng chōng.*\n*Bì cáng yù wén fāng jiù lóng,*\n*sān tiān yùn míng liù tiān zhōng.*\n\n*Master Dù said: ‘This spell must be recited silently; do not let your own ears hear it. Violating this brings misfortune—be cautious, be cautious.’*\n\n*From the *Wǔ Fú Rén Niǎo Jīng*, Master Zhào Míngjǔ states: ‘Though divided into nine colors, the essence remains the Primordial Xuan Yuan alone. For the nine colors originate from the Three Qi—Qīng, Huáng, and Bái. If further divided into colors like Zǐ and Bǐ, it becomes overly complex and loses its simplicity. Thus, the Three Qi are divided into Nine Qi for the exorcism.’*\n\n**Explanation of the Exorcism Ritual**\n*Master Zhāng Wànfú of the Qingdū School says: ‘Before the Celestial Venerable spoke the scripture, the demon kings of the Three Realms and Ten Thousand Worlds were the leaders of all ghosts, wielding power and poisoning the world, harming living beings. After the Celestial Venerable spoke the scripture, the demons submitted and transformed, guarding the Dao and protecting the law. They restrained the myriad demons, safeguarding those who practice genuine cultivation, thus enabling their ascension into the ranks of immortals. Hence it is said: “Any who dare to obstruct those practicing genuine cultivation shall be slain by the Golden Axe and punished by the Great Queen of the Afterworld.” It is also said: “The Great Demon King, upholding the Ascended Immortal, has fully attained the Dao and now wanders the Three Realms, entering the Golden Gate.” And again: “The Eastern Extermination of demonic essences, the beheading of the Six Ghostly Chiefs—this is the meaning.” Thus, the invocation of demons refers to summoning the demon kings of the Ten Thousand Worlds to uphold the merit of the ritual, to restrain and subdue malevolent ghosts. The *Stepping Through the Void Scripture* states: “The demon kings respectfully receive the ritual’s command, thus able to attend the Celestial Assembly. Both celestial and demonic beings respect and protect, receiving great blessings in this world and the next. The scattered flowers express my vow, the clenched talisman summons the demon kings.”*\n\n**Refined Contemplation for Reciting the Scripture**\n*According to Master Dù’s ritual guidance, when reciting the scripture’s verses, one must reach the stage of silent, lawful contemplation. Then, the Master follows the scripture’s instructions, visualizing while reciting the spells. However, the ritual text does not specify the method of visualization; thus, it is recorded here according to Master Lu’s diagrams and instructions.*\n\n**Visualization and Spiritual Preservation from the *Dào Dé Jīng***\n*The *Tàijí Yǐnzhù* states: ‘When reading the *Dào Dé Jīng* of the Celestial Venerable, first burn incense, adjust your attire, and bow three times. Visualize the Primordial Daoist Master, the Celestial Venerable Lǎojūn, who in the past was the Primordial Daoist Master of the Riverbank, Yín Xiansheng. Recite the spells while visualizing:*\n\n*\"Xuán xuán zhì dào zōng,*\n*Shàng dé tǐ hóng yuán.*\n*Tiān zhēn suī yuǎn miào,*\n*Jìn yuán níhuán jūn.*\n\n*Though distant, the Celestial Venerable is near in essence—*\n*the Níhuán Palace, where the Jade Emperor resides,*\n*is the brain’s center.

Complete each phrase without omitting or rushing the Celestial Venerable’s words—three violations bring blame.’*\n\n*The *Tàijí Yǐnzhù* states: ‘After reciting five hundred words of the scripture, strike the teeth three times, let the tongue moist the upper and lower lips, and swallow saliva three times—this prevents exhaustion.’*\n\n**Visualization and Spiritual Preservation from the *Dù Rén Jīng***\n*The scripture states: ‘On the day of practicing the Dao, bathe in fragrant water and purify yourself in seclusion. Facing east, strike the teeth thirty-two times, invoking the thirty-two heavens above. Bow thirty-two times in your heart, swallow saliva thirty-two times. Close your eyes and sit in still contemplation, your body resting within the three-colored clouds of Qīng, Huáng, and Bái. Within and without, all is dense and mysterious. Visualize the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lions, and White Cranes arrayed to your left and right. The sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber within.

chapter,\nrecite the *Tàiqīng* (Supreme Clarity) text.\n\nFrom *Yīn Zhēn Rén’s* *Wèn Kē Jīng* (Scripture of Questioning the Laws)\nand the Celestial Master’s *Wèn Fǎ Jīng* (Scripture of Questioning the Dao):\nThe Celestial Master told the Most High:\n*\"There are those who read the *Tàiqīng* first, then report it;\nor report it first, then read the *Tàiqīng*;\nor read the *Tàiqīng* characters first, then report, then state their surname;\nor break off and read the *Tàiqīng* last.\nThese differ—what is the correct method?\"*\n\nThe Most High said:\n*\"When reporting is complete, then state your surname,\nthen read the *Tàiqīng*, then the year number,\neach separated by three lines—\nthis is the unchanging method of writing the chapter.\nBut when proclaiming aloud,\nreporting is complete, then kneel deeply and grasp the extreme,\nfirst read the *Tàiqīng*, speaking the fine characters softly.\nDo not let the voice rise sharply—\ndo not cough or swallow saliva.\nRecite in one breath, then state your surname,\nthen the year number—\nthis is the Heavenly Emperor’s complete method.\"*\n\n---\n**Zhào Míngjǔ’s Master’s Method of Spreading *Qi* and Chanting the Seal:**\n\n*\"The Three *Qi* originally merge to form the body,\nthe Primordial Sovereign’s features now clear.\nWithin lies the Dao of the Mysterious and the Void,\nbut fear the times may lack precision in learning.\"*\n\n**Seal of the Seven Elements, the Leader, the Dipper, and the True Form Talisman:**\n\n*\"The chapter’s seals and all ritual diagrams\nare unseen in the scriptures—\nsuch as the *Bǎozhāng Lì* of the Red Pine Child,\nthe talismans of Broad Achievement Master,\nand the *Jīn Guàn* ritual diagrams—\nnone are recorded.\"*\n\n*\"One must inquire of the venerable past masters and say: 'In my youth, I still saw my predecessors, at the moment, use a red brush to inscribe this talisman upon the ritual diagrams, its height and depth forming the **Northern Dipper** constellation. Truly, this was meant to guard and protect the ritual diagrams, ensuring their efficacy must reach its fullest extent.\n\n'Later, upon examining the **Broad Achievement Master’s Purple Court Ritual** of the Northern Obscurity, I saw the **Seven Elements Seal** inscribed upon yellow silk, wrapped around the words of the ritual, and sealed within the case. Only then did I believe the words of the venerable past masters were not false.\n\n'With reverence, I publish this method, and further explain their reasoning: 'Nowadays, these talismans are made as seals, but this is a later private interpretation. The **True Form Talisman** of the **Heavenly Emperor’s Supreme Seal**—I bow twice to report this. Bow twice, then state your name: **\"Uppermost Way\" (太清上) and \"Lowest Way\" (太清下)**, the **True Form Talisman** of the **Heavenly Sovereign (太歲)**, and the **Three Generals Seal** are inscribed upon the right side of the ritual case.\n\n'The **Six Celestial Stems Seal** of **Yin-Yang**—two talismans, one for each—from **Jiazi (甲子)** to **Yihou (乙丑)**, each having its own seal. The lower one must always conclude with the **Yin Seal** and the **Yang Seal**. **Jiazi** represents **Yang**, **Yihou** represents **Yin**; **Yang** governs the **Yang Realm**, **Yin** governs the **Yin Realm**.\n\n'Now, when spreading the talisman, this involves matters of the **Yang Realm**, so one must use the **Yang Seal**. Yet, in common practice, many inscribe the **Yin Seal** upon the case and use both talismans together, with incantations beneath them. The **Yang Seal** reads:\n\n*'**Midheaven Great Sage** (中天大聖), **Flying Heaven Swift** (飛天捷疾), seizes and apprehends the **Yang Jade Realm’s** ghosts—those within the **Yang Realm** and the lower **Yin-Yang Void**—and delivers them to the **Northern Prison of Heaven One** (天一北獄), where they are judged according to the **Dharma Law** (律). The **Tang Gezhou Generals** (唐葛周將軍) and the **True Martial General** (真武將軍) await with drawn swords.'\n\nThe **Yin Seal** reads:\n\n*'**Midheaven Great Sage** (中天大聖), **Flying Heaven Swift** (飛天捷疾), seizes and apprehends the **Yin Jade Realm’s** ghosts—those within the **Yin Realm** and the five **Void Directions** (五方無道之鬼)—and delivers them to the **Northern Prison of Heaven One** (天一北獄), where they are judged according to the **Dharma Law** (律). The **Tang Gezhou Generals** (唐葛周將軍) and the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water** (天地水三官) come to their aid.\n\n'The **Dissolving Form Talisman** follows the same structure as above: **\"Midheaven Great Sage\" (中天大聖), \"Flying Heaven Swift\" (飛天捷疾), seizing and apprehending the **Yang Jade Realm’s** ghosts—those within the **Yang Realm** and the **Yin-Yang Void**—as the **True Martial General** (真武將軍) awaits with drawn swords, up to the **Tang Gezhou Generals** (唐葛周將軍). The **Yin Seal** follows this pattern accordingly.\n\n'The **Supine Talisman** and the **Stepfighting Dipper Diagram** (伏章步斗圖) are also included.\"*\n\nAt this juncture, the **Celestial Rotation** (乾旋) is invoked within the **Fighting Man** (人斗) through the **Supine Talisman** (伏章) and the **Stepfighting Dipper Diagram** (步斗歌):\n\n*\"Kàn* (坎) and *Gèn* (艮) move in paired single steps, crossing *Qián* (乾);\n*Zhèn* (震) advances in double ranks, as does *Duì* (兑) likewise.\n*Kūn* (坤) follows *Lí* (离) in paired single steps, while *Xùn* (巽) turns—\nWhen the **Three Stars** (三台) return, they ascend to **Heaven** (朝天).\n\nThe **Preserved Talisman** (存章) reflects the **Divine Method** (神法), as recorded in **Master Sun’s** teachings within his collection.\n\nThis is the **Most High’s** (太上) hidden secret—though preserved in written scrolls, the **heart-method** (心法) is a self-realized mystery, beyond words.\n\nSince **Master Sun** has already revealed it, yet instructed that my disciples should guard this doctrine, lest it be carelessly disclosed to others, I refrain from further engraving or mass reproduction, lest the **Heavenly Secrets** (天秘) be widely leaked. Future seekers who pay heed should consult **Master Sun’s** original text and inquire into its hidden meanings from those of earlier attainment.\n\nThis is the **Dao Gate’s** (道門) universal teaching, which must be found within the **Ninth Volume** (集卷之九) of its compilation.",

      "translated_text": "The Celestial Master established his teachings in the Western Shu, while Guangcheng attained final repose in Yizhou, hence the people of Shu revered the Dao in great splendor and observed its rites meticulously.\n\nUpon examining the traditions passed down by the various lineages, it was found that there were no authoritative editions, and errors were indeed numerous.\n\nRecently, observing the completion of the Zhongzang Canon, I encountered Liu Gong of the Left History Bureau and Zhu Gong of the Tai Chang Office, both officials in the capital. Li Gong of the Two Rivers, a disciple of the Master of the Daoist Lineage, requested that I obtain several hundred Daoist scriptures from the capital, all of which were texts missing from Shu.\n\nAmong them, ritualistic liturgy was predominant, so I commissioned Master Taigu to compare and reconcile their differences, to examine antiquity and distinguish the present.\n\nFrom the foundational teachings for novices to the advanced rites of practice, he meticulously compiled them into a collection for the benefit of future generations, coinciding with my tenure as the Yellow Arrow Register of the Two Rivers.\n\nScholars and practitioners from all directions gathered in homage, and thus the texts were engraved upon wooden tablets for all to share.\n\nI have often lamented my inability to contribute, as some merely stand by with folded arms, while others mock or even suppress these teachings, unwilling to utter a single word to my disciples.\n\nIs this not contrary to the Celestial Master’s intent, which was to foster growth and abundance? If the Daoist lineage lacks scriptures, should not those who share this vision strive to emulate the spirit of Zhengyi and Guangcheng, thereby upholding the grand tradition?\n\nIn the summer of the year *Jiaxu* of the *Jiatai* era, Master Lü Yuansu of Jiangyuan, the recluse of the Northern Peak, composed this work.\n\nIn ancient times, the Son of Heaven sacrificed to Heaven and Earth, communing with the divine, all with solemn rites—pure offerings, meticulous attire, preliminary fasting, and then the full observance, lest the ritual fail to honor the spirits and the sacrifice be incomplete. How much more so for commoners?\n\nThus, the Celestial Master expounded the scriptures and established precepts, prioritizing compassion over killing. Following this, the Celestial Master established his teachings, transforming sacrifices into *zhaijiao* rites, mirroring Heaven and Earth, offering reverence, reciting scriptures, and dispatching talismans to convey prayers, all to elevate grand rituals and refine pure sacrifices.\n\nTherefore, hymns and odes were composed to praise the Daoist temples, where words became music, and it was said that sound could reach the divine, invoking blessings from above and below. The *Changxu* (recitation of talismans) and *Yongdong* (chanting of scriptures) were derived from this principle, and their essence was unchanging.\n\nSince the Celestial Master’s establishment of his teachings, those among the Daoist lineage who focused on ritualistic precepts often neglected the study of sound, while those who mastered sound often lacked the full complement of ritualistic observances.\n\nThis is akin to Gongshu Bu’s skill—without the compass and square, how could he measure the perfect circles and squares?\n\nIn the Song dynasty, the Lü family of Helin compiled the Daoist scriptures, gathering their mysteries into a collection they titled *The Comprehensive Teachings Collection* (通教集).\n\nFrom the imperial court to the common folk, for the sake of the nation, the family, the living, and the dead, those who practiced *zhao* (ritual fasting) and *jiao* (exorcism) revered Daoist teachings universally, all finding partial illumination.\n\nIt was also to ensure that students of the Dao would master the precepts through ritualistic discipline, thereby comprehending its teachings. His intent was indeed broad.\n\nHe Gong of Yuntai further elucidated these principles, enabling practitioners to refine and master the rituals, and compiled *The Refined Teachings Collection* (炼教集), which has since circulated widely.\n\nWithin these two collections, there are mutual strengths and weaknesses, and those who study them cannot help but raise questions.\n\nNow, Master Ma Daoyi of Jincheng’s Three Wells Observance, who has long resided among the Daoist elite, has devoted years to the study of ritualistic texts without ever abandoning them.\n\nThus, he merged *The Comprehensive Teachings Collection* (通教集) and *The Refined Teachings Collection* (炼教集), selecting their finest elements, categorizing them into a single volume, and engraved it for wider dissemination.\n\nHe entrusted me with a preface to explain his purpose. I replied: In matters of scholarship, I have always taken care. Within the realm of ritual teachings, my knowledge has been neglected for many years.\n\nYet you have taken this as a teaching, and I dare not fail to encourage its completion for the sake of its beauty.\n\nStudents of the Dao may use this to understand its standards, and those with noble aspirations may practice it to commune with the divine.\n\nThis is indeed a grand event for the Daoist lineage—who could not rejoice in it?\n\nIn the mid-autumn of the *Yuan Zheng* year, Master Han Hongcheng, the Senior Lecturer of Ren’an Observance and the Great Master of Proliferating the Dao and Awakening to Truth, respectfully composed this preface.\n\n**Essential for the Daoist Comprehensive Teachings Collection (通教集):**\nAt the outset of seeking the Dao, one must first seek its standards. Those who take vows must possess the complete scriptures and precepts.\n\nFrom the Han dynasty to the present, all who upheld the lineage and established teachings followed the Celestial Master’s model, and their practices can serve as exemplary standards. Thus, the first section is established as *Standards of the Celestial Master*:\n\n- *Scriptures and Precepts of the Celestial Master’s Ascetic Life*\n- *Brief Biographies of Successive Masters*\n\nFor novices entering the Dao, the hymns of response must come first, from the *Opening Hall* to the *Farewell to the Sage*, all can be praised and recorded in the ritual scriptures.\n\nAt the beginning of initiation, one may lack a good edition, hence the second section is established as *Verbal Praises*:\n\n- *Words of the Step-into-Void Rite and Praises*\n- *True-Writing Talismans for Invoking All Kinds of Perfected Ones*\n- *True-Writing Talismans for Disaster Dispersion in the Five Directions*\n- *Twelve Vows of Mindful Retention*",

      "translated_text": "The *Sutra of the Causes and Conditions for Leaving Home* states: The Daoists have seven stages in total. The Celestial Venerable says:\n\n1. **Celestial Purity**—that is, the body harmonizes with Nature, and the inner and outer are perfectly tranquil.\n2. **Divine Immortals**—that is, transformations beyond measure, transcending the realm of the ordinary.\n3. **Secluded Elegance**—that is, containing light and hiding brilliance, unburdened by worldly entanglements.\n4. **Mountain Dwellers**—that is, secluded in study of the Dao, with wisdom and benevolence naturally at ease.\n5. **Those Who Leave Home**—that is, abandoning all attachments to the world, casting off the dust and clamor of mortal life.\n6. **Those Who Remain in the World**—that is, blending with the world’s light, embracing the Dao and nurturing virtue.\n7. **Sacrificial Attendants**—that is, humbling oneself among the vulgar, rescuing and delivering those in peril.\n\nThus, the term *Daoist* refers to one who, in all actions—moving, standing, sitting, or lying down—every thought and intention is devoted solely to cultivating the Dao and attending to virtue. They observe fasts and pay homage, chant scriptures and burn incense, uphold precepts and refine their conduct, light lamps for repentance, make offerings with sincere vows, expound the Great Vehicle, and guide all beings. They awaken the great mind of the Dao, create boundless merit, benefit all without distinction, and always place others before themselves, free from worldly toil. Their sole pursuit is the Dao’s work, and thus they are revered as the most exalted among the Six Paths and Fourfold Existence—both heavenly and earthly. They do not bow to the Son of Heaven nor salute the feudal lords, becoming fields of blessing for humankind and the refuge for the Three Realms.\n\nThe **Seventeen Vows of Daoist Aspiration for Leaving Home and Attaining the True Body**:\n1. I vow never to kill living beings, for it severs the sacred lineage.\n2. I vow forever to abstain from alcohol, for it corrupts pure nature.\n3. I vow forever to abstain from blood, for it defiles the body.\n4. I vow not to consume the five pungent herbs, for they obstruct the paths of Heaven and Earth.\n5. I vow not to indulge in lustful desires, for they disturb the mind.\n6. I vow not to speak of others’ faults, for it invites hatred.\n7. I vow not to covet wealth, for it hinders the Dao.\n8. I vow to diligently cultivate merit, for it adorns oneself.\n9. I vow not to disturb or anger others, for it breeds karmic enmity.\n10. I vow to benefit others without hesitation, for it is no different from benefiting myself.\n11. I vow forever to speak no falsehoods, for it makes others distrustful.\n12. I vow never to grow weary or negligent, for it dulls the resolve of the Dao.\n13. I vow to study all methods with effort, for it ripens the wisdom of the seed.\n14. I vow never to steal from others, for it demands double repayment.\n15. I vow to always observe inner fasting, for it attains pure harmony of mind.\n16. I vow to constantly reflect upon the emptiness and tranquility of all dharmas, for it swiftly advances the Dao.\n17. I vow to always be humble and silent as the foolish, for it ensures inner peace.\n\nAll the above vows are upheld by novices who enter the Dao.\n\nThe *Sutra of Ascending the Mysterious* states: The Daoist’s conduct is entirely opposite to that of the common person. Their eyes do not gaze excessively, nor are they startled by beauty. Their ears do not listen to slander nor to chaotic sounds. Their noses do not inhale fragrant scents, nor do they relish the pungent stench of decay. Their mouths do not crave sweetness, nor do they consume what violates all life. Their hearts do not dwell on desires, whether for wealth, sensual pleasures, or honor. Their hands do not act deceitfully, nor do their feet tread upon evil.\n\nThe *Sutra of Ascending the Mysterious* also states: All who leave home must discard ornamentation and fine attire, wearing only coarse cloth and simple garments, dwelling in lowly beds and modest huts—merely to sustain their bodies. They must not indulge in luxury. Except for treating illness or traveling, they may not seek permission to go outside. They must reside in clean, secluded places, indulging in the Dao’s subtle and boundless joys. This is called the **threshold of hearing the Dao** and the **foundation of great virtue**.\n\nThe *Sutra of Fixing the Will* states: In the past, there was a youth of twelve who lived in idle pleasure, preparing fine food together, drinking deeply and reveling in games. Sometimes they would debate whether the practice of the Dao and the upholding of precepts were difficult or easy. The Celestial Venerable, in great tranquility, perceived them and knew that in their previous lives, each had been a teacher to others, hoarding scriptures and grudgingly sharing them, causing their disciples to hesitate. Now, they had fallen into the dust of the world through this slight cause, yet still could be saved. The Celestial Venerable then transformed into a mortal man, passing through their gathering and overhearing their conversation. The man said: *\"Upholding precepts is very easy; not upholding them is far more difficult.\"* The youth, hearing this, asked in unison: *\"How so, sir? You say upholding precepts is easy, yet not upholding them is difficult?\"* The man replied: *\"Standing upright like a precept is easy—one need not fear the Son of Heaven nor the spirits and gods. But breaking a precept is difficult: such a person fears all mortals and fears the spirits and gods even more. How could it not be difficult?\"* Thus, the twelve youth, upon hearing the man’s words, all recalled their past lives, resolved to uphold precepts, and together attained the fruit of the Dao.\n\nThe *Sutra of the Dharma Wheel* states: The Celestial Venerable of Oneness and Mystery instructed Ge Xian Gong, saying: *\"In my past, I received my teacher’s instruction with utmost severity. The lessons cut deep as a knife, stung like a poisoned thorn. I bowed and knelt in service, never daring to slacken, never daring to refuse the pain or speak of the poison. Now that I have attained the fruit of the Dao, I cannot repay my teacher’s kindness.\"*\n\nThe *Great True Precepts* state: Daoists must first master the **Five Thousand Characters** of scriptural study. They must expound and comprehend the teachings, guide others, and benefit themselves, opening boundless enlightenment. This is the mark of the **Great Vehicle Practitioner**.\n\nThe *Great True Precepts* also state: At the dawn of creation, the **Sage-True Immortals** all proclaimed the Dao’s *qi* and established laws, passing them down through generations. They shared the same lineage as the Celestial Venerable, all called **Learned Masters**. Their work was the Dao, and their devotion to the Dao bore fruit, earning them the title of *Daoist*.\n\nThe *Sutra of Illuminating the Threat* states: **Study must never be superficial**, for false and true teachings may appear similar. One must not fail to discern them, for failure leads to perilous paths, while clarity grants ease. The difference between clarity and obscurity lies in the mind’s careful examination. The method of discernment is to **pervasively study all scriptures**, test them through experience, and verify their truth. Thus, one naturally attains luminous understanding—whether of worldly or transcendent laws, of actions with or without purpose. One will naturally fathom the subtleties of the **Three Pure Ones**.\n\n**Brief Transmission of the Lineage Across Generations**:\nThe Daoist teachings are ancient. **Huangdi and Laozi** championed the Way of **Purity and Stillness**. The disciples **Yin Ling, Zhang Tao, Lie Yukou, and Zhuangzi** expanded upon it, and the tradition flowed down to **Le Su Gong**. Gong taught **Ge Xian Gong**, and Ge Xian Gong taught **Cao Can**.",

      "translated_text": "The efficacy of these words in governing the world is as described—how much more so the Dao of **Huang-Lao**!\n\nAlas, the world now indulges in extravagance and excess, and thus this Way grows hidden. The study of **immortality and transcendence** flourishes, and rites of supplication and sacrifice thrive. From the Eastern Han onward, until the beginning of the **Sui Dynasty**, **Pengqiuzi Jia Shanheng** and over a hundred others proclaimed this Way to the world, compiling *The High Dao Transmission*. From these, I have selected the most distinguished ten or so, distilling their essence and appending them to the scriptural teachings, so that my disciples may know whom to emulate and revere.\n\n**Zhang Tian师**\nTian师 bore the surname Zhang, given name **Dao Ling**, and courtesy name **Fu Han**. By nature, he was silent and revered antiquity, mastering both scriptures and histories while also excelling in **celestial omens and divination**. He relieved the urgent needs of others without distinction of familiarity or distance, and thus the world esteemed him, drawing many to his discipleship. When the **Emperor Zhang** summoned him, he declined, sighing as he parted from his disciples—only **Wang Chang** remained to attend him. He then retreated to **Qian** and **Heng**, reaching **Zhongyue Mountain**, where he obtained the **Nine Elixir Scriptures**. Upon refining the elixir, he told Chang: *\"I have yet to fulfill a great deed—how dare I hastily consume it? I must first benefit the state and family, eliminating harm and promoting good, before I may act lightly.\"* Thus, he moved the **Celestial Sovereign** to descend, granting him the **All-One Alliance and Awe** methods, subduing the **hosts of demons and jade maidens**, and establishing **twenty-four administrative precincts**. He taught people to confess sins and apportion blessings, instituting systematic precepts. The people of Shu were transformed, abandoning vice and fleeing crime. Later, upon **Yuntai Peak**, the Celestial Sovereign dispatched a **cloud-chariot** to descend and welcome him, and he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\n**Ge Xian Gong**\nXian Gong bore the surname Ge, given name **Xuan**, and courtesy name **Xiao Xian**. From his youth, he loved learning, mastering all **scriptures, histories, and classics**, and his fame spread across the **Jiangzuo region**. He often played the zither and recited **Zhuangzi and Laozi**, content and serene, needing nothing within. He then entered **Chicheng Mountain** to cultivate the Dao, later wandering through **Kuaiyang, Luofulou, Jinjing, Hezao, Yushi, and Tiantai Mountains**, refining his practice and recitations. Thus, he was visited by the **Three Pure Ones of the Supreme Polarity**, who bestowed upon him the **Three Cavern Treasure Scriptures**. At eighteen, he achieved Dao-completion, his transformations beyond measure. He compiled the essentials of the Three Caverns into the *Nine Abyssal Confessions* and authored over ten volumes on **Laozi and other scriptures**. One day, he told his disciples **Zheng Siyuan** and others: *\"The Wu ruler detains me, preventing me from reciting the Cavern Scriptures. I must first achieve **corpse dissolution**, then ascend to heaven.\"* When the time came, his body softened like silk, filling the room with fragrant qi. By the fifth day, a great wind arose, extinguishing all lamps. When the fire was lit, his corpse had vanished.\n\n**Wang Zuan**\nThe Daoist **Wang Zuan** resided on **Maji Mountain**, often performing **meritorious deeds in secret** to save others. During the late **Western Jin**, as the Central Plains fell into chaos, famine, pestilence, and disease ravaged the people, many perishing without relief. Moved by pity, Zuan composed a **petition in seclusion**, weeping profusely. After three nights, light filled his chamber as at noon. Soon, auspicious winds and clouds gathered in the sky, strange fragrances and celestial music descended to his courtyard, accompanied by **banners and flags**, **green boys and jade maidens**, and **dragons and tigers** as guards. Suddenly, the sounds of **mouth organs and flutes** came from the northwest. Amidst five-colored light, a **celestial official** announced to Zuan: *\"The Dao Sovereign of the Celestial Sovereign arrives.\"* A **treasure-seat** then descended from the sky, and the Dao Sovereign took his place. Zuan knelt and prostrated himself before him. The Dao Sovereign said: *\"You pitied the living, your petition sincere, your heart laid bare—this moved both the seen and unseen. The earthly officials have reported you, and I have come to observe.\"* The Dao Sovereign then expounded on **the cycles of yin and yang**, the **ascents and descents of humans and spirits**, the **Six Heavens’ demons and fallen generals**, who preyed on the weak, seizing opportunities to harm the living. *\"I have subdued them with solar might and divine incantations, and their chaos has naturally ceased.\"* He then commanded his attendants to grant Zuan the **Scriptures of Divine Transformation and Divine Incantations**, along with the **Three-Five Fast Precepts**, saying: *\"Diligently practice these—true stages may yet be attained.\"* As Zuan traveled through **Jiangbiao**, the plagues ceased.\n\n**Lu Tian师**\nLu **Xiujing**, courtesy name **Yuande**,",

Thus, you devoted yourself exclusively to Daoist teachings, never ceasing in your studies, even in sleep. When you heard of a master of strange arts, though distant, you would seek them out. Dwelling in the rugged peaks of Jing, the people of Jiang and Han would come to listen, arriving empty-handed but returning with true understanding.\n\nBy the end of the Song dynasty’s **Yuanjia** era, Emperor Wen could not summon you. But when Emperor Ming ascended, desiring to bring **purity and stillness** to guide the people toward simplicity and sincerity, he deeply admired you. Thus, he repeatedly invited you, and you finally accepted the imperial command to descend from the mountains. Bears, tigers, monkeys, and birds lamented along the road, their sorrowful cries echoing—such was your influence on all things.\n\nUpon reaching the capital, you were lodged in a guesthouse outside the palace gates, allowing both officials and commoners to receive instruction from you. You then clarified the distinctions between **heresy and orthodoxy**, examining and verifying the authenticity of teachings. From this, the corrupt customs of the age transformed in unison. You once blended the **Three Caverns’ scriptures and methods**, but later corrected and refined them.\n\nYou also composed **rituals for fasting and purification**, establishing them as enduring precepts for future generations. Your friendship with **Tao Yuanming**, a fellow **outsider to formal ranks**, reveals much of your character.\n\nIn the fifth year of **Yuanhui**, on the first month, you suddenly told your disciples: 'I am pressed by imperial favor, forced to abandon my lifelong resolve. Now I shall return to my old mountain retreat.' Your disciples were astonished. On the second day of the third month, you quietly ascended, your skin radiant and luminous, a fragrant scent lingering in the air.

      "translated_text": "At eighteen, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to the Dao, his spirit subtly attuned to the **Supreme Mysteries**. There was a **Celestial Master**, Cheng Gongxing, who took him as a servant in his household. One day, as Kao Qianzhi calculated the **cosmic resonances** of the **Five Phases** and **Six Qi**, he found the **Celestial Patterns** misaligned. Gongxing instructed him, and with a single adjustment, it was perfected. After some time, Gongxing said to him: *\"The Daoist Master has the will to cultivate the Way—perhaps you and I may withdraw together.\"* He then took him to **Hua Mountain**, where they gathered herbs for sustenance. From that point on, Qianzhi never again felt hunger. One day, he said: *\"I shall depart, but someone will bring you medicine.\"* He ate it, and indeed, it was as he had spoken. Upon examining the herbs, they were foul and venomous—poisonous creatures and noxious substances. He grew fearful and left. Gongxing returned and explained, sighing: *\"The Daoist Master is not yet ready for transcendence, but he may become a teacher for kings.\"* He added: *\"I shall depart tomorrow.\"* True to his word, he ascended at the appointed time. Qianzhi then settled in **Songyang**, never emerging again.\n\nIn the second year of **Shenrui**, on the first day of the fourth month, two men suddenly arrived, riding dragons and bearing **auspicious banners**, declaring: *\"The **Celestial Worthy** has come.\"* In an instant, the **Most High** descended in a **Nine-Dragon Jade Chariot**, surrounded by divine attendants, gathering atop the mountain. Qianzhi bowed in reverent devotion. The **Most High** commanded **Wang Fangping** to bring Qianzhi forward, saying: *\"I have received the **Celestial Register of the Central Peak’s Gathering of Immortals**, which states that since **Zhang Daoling** attained **True Perfection**, those who cultivate the Way have lacked a true teacher. Now there is the **Daoist of the Central Peak, Kao Qianzhi**, whose conduct aligns with **Natural Principle**. He should be placed in the **Master’s rank**, and thus I entrust you with the **Celestial Master’s mission**, along with the **Cloud-Middle Chanting**—the **Precious Scripture of the **Harmonious Precepts** and the **Newly Codified **Void-Wandering** Rituals**. You must proclaim them, assist the empire, and transform the people.\"* After Qianzhi accepted, the **Five-Cloud Platform Hall** vanished. From then on, his resolve and conduct grew ever more refined.\n\nDuring the **Shiji** era, the imperial court sent officials to summon him to the capital. **Sima Chengzhi**, the **Grand Tutor**, became his disciple, and the emperor himself knelt before him, asking questions with the utmost reverence. A **Celestial Altar** was erected in his honor, and thus the entire realm turned to him in veneration. The **Celestial Master** once performed rites at the **Central Peak** for the emperor’s blessings, and through his profound sincerity, the **Most High** secretly bestowed upon the emperor the title **Emperor of True Peace**. That year, the era was renamed **True Peace, First Year**.\n\nBy the ninth year, he told his disciples: *\"I dreamed of Cheng Gongxing, who summoned me to the **Celestial Palace of the Central Peak**.\"* In the fifth month, he **ascended in spirit**, with a **green vapor** like mist emanating from his mouth, rising to the heavens before dissipating. His body gradually shrank, and those who understood it called it **corpse dissolution**. He lived to eighty-four. Later, **Shen You** saw him atop the **Central Peak**, his body radiant silver, shining like the sun—thus proving him to be an **Immortal**.\n\n---\n\n**Celestial Master Wang Daoyi**\nWang Daoyi, a **Daoist** of the **Wei Dynasty**, was well-versed in all scriptures and mastered the **divinatory classics**. Learning of the **Empress Yin’s retreat** at **Zhongnan**, he came with six or seven disciples to dwell there, joining **Daoist Yin Lingjian** and forty others in spreading the **Great Dao’s transformation**. Though times were famine-stricken and provisions scarce, Daoyi expanded the **observatory halls** with hundreds of artisans, yet expenses never faltered. All knew it was due to the **Master’s divine influence**, as if secretly aided by the **Celestial**. Thus, every **pavilion and hall** was renewed.\n\nHe ordered his disciples to gather **True Scriptures**, amassing over ten thousand volumes—all through his own efforts, never seeking aid from others. His nature was boundless and unencumbered; even in his inner chambers, those who eavesdropped on his disciples found only **gathered Immortals** in speech. During the **Yongping** era, as he was about to **ascend**, white clouds and strange fragrances filled the room, lingering for days. A villager returning from afar saw Daoyi depart riding a **deer**.\n\n---\n\n**Master of Rectification, Sima Chengzhen**\nSima Chengzhen, courtesy name **Zimwei**, served **Pan Shizheng** and mastered the **Alchemy of the Form**. His teacher, recognizing his extraordinary nature, fully transmitted the **Dao of Tao Yuanming’s Rectification**. After some time, he declined and wandered the sacred peaks. Arriving at **Tiantai**, he built a **multi-tiered pavilion** on the altar, naming it the **Pavilion of Universal Marvels**.\n\nThe **Empress Wu** summoned him, but he soon departed. He was counted among the **Ten Friends of the Daoist Sect**, alongside **Chen Zhi’ang, Lu Zangyong, Song Zhiwen, Wang Shi, Bi Gou, Li Bai, Meng Haoran, Wang Wei, and He Zhizhang**.\n\nThe **Emperor Ruizong** summoned him again, commanding his brother **Sima Chengyi** to deliver the imperial edict, insisting he come. Upon arrival, he was led into the **inner palace**, where the emperor questioned him on his arts. The Master replied: *\"Cultivating the Dao is daily subtraction, until one reaches **non-being**—what the vulgar eyes and ears perceive. Each subtraction is already difficult; how much more so to attack heterodoxies and inflate one’s cleverness?\"*\n\nThe emperor asked: *\"This applies to refining one’s self, but how does it govern the realm?\"*\nThe Master answered: *\"The realm is but an extension of the self. Thus, one must **harmonize the mind with stillness**, **blend the qi with emptiness**, let **things follow their nature**, and abandon all **private scheming**—then the realm will be governed.\"*\n\nThe emperor sighed: *\"The words of **Broad-Nurturing Child**!\"*\nHe then requested permission to return to the mountains, receiving a **jewel-veined lute** and a **cloud-patterned robe** as gifts. The emperor ordered officials to compose poems in farewell.\n\nThe **Emperor Xuanzong** decreed the construction of **altars and chambers** on **Wangwu Mountain** for his residence. At that time, **Jiao Jingzhen**, a **Female Immortal** of the **Mohe**, sailed to **Penglai** in search of a teacher. Upon reaching a mountain, she was told by a **Daoist** that *\"Sima Zimwei of Tiantai Mountain is renowned in the **Jade Hall**, dwelling in **Chicheng**—he is truly a noble teacher.\"* Jingzhen returned to receive the Dao from the Master and soon ascended.\n\nOnce, descending to speak with **Xue Jichang**, he said: *\"The Master has attained the Dao higher than **Tao Dunshui**; he shall become the **Eastern Heaven’s Pure and Clear True Person**.\"* One day, the Master suddenly told his **grass-clad disciples**: *\"From the **Jade Mist Peak’s east**, I see **Penglai’s** Immortals descending. Now the **Eastern Heaven’s Green Boy Lord** summons me—I must go.\"* In an instant, he ascended.\n\nThe emperor posthumously honored him as **Silver Green Light-Lucre Grand Official**, with the posthumous title **Master of Rectification**.

      "translated_text": "Li Han Guang\nThe Daoist Li Han Guang, at the age of thirteen, was deeply devoted to Daoist learning. Though in seclusion, he conducted himself as if before sovereign and father. Skilled in seal and clerical scripts, men praised him as surpassing his own father. Once he heard the Dao, he never again engaged in worldly affairs.\n\nHis master, Master Sima Zhengyi, upon seeing him, declared: *\"He is indeed a guest of the True Celestial Purity.\"* He admonished him: *\"Hold fast to emptiness, accumulate no attachments, and your Way shall know no end. Entrust yourself to the hidden peaks and efface your traces—your virtue is profound.\"* Thus, he entrusted him with all his sacred texts, bidding him first save others.\n\nHan Guang, having received this teaching, forgot himself in the Dao and aided others in their needs. Whenever he conducted rituals, he purified his heart and body without slacking. The Tang Emperor Minghuang summoned him to inquire about his practices, and he replied: *\"The Dao De Jing is the sovereign’s teacher. When the Han Emperor Wen practiced it, he elevated the people to benevolent longevity.\"*\n\nThe emperor further asked about the Golden Cauldron, and he answered: *\"The Dao and its virtue are public. Lightness of action is private within the public—if one seeks life while indulging desires, it is like harnessing the wind; how difficult!\"*\n\nThe emperor praised him and treated him with great honor. Soon after, Han Guang requested to return to Jùqū.

      "translated_text": "「Mastered the *Classics of Dao* and refined eloquent prose. Though he failed to pass the *Jìnshì* examinations, he departed to dwell at Yǐdì Mountain. In the early years of *Tiānbǎo*, he was summoned to the capital, where he petitioned to be enrolled among the *Daoists*, studying under Master Pàn Shīzhèng. He journeyed south to *Tiāntái*, gazed upon the *Cānghǎi*, and consorted with eminent scholars, whose literary works spread back to the capital.\n\nEmperor *Mínghuáng* summoned him and conversed with great delight, commanding him to serve as a *Hànlín* scribe and presenting him with three essays on the *Xuángāng*. The emperor inquired about the Dao, and he replied: *\"None surpass Laozi in profound understanding of the Dao; Your Majesty may seek it within the *Wǔqiān Wén*.\"* When further questioned about the arts of *shénxiān* (immortals) and alchemical cultivation, he answered: *\"This is the concern of rustics, not of a sovereign—it is unwise for rulers to dwell upon such matters.\"*\n\nYet whenever he spoke, his discourse centered on *orthodox teachings* and worldly affairs, employing subtle language to admonish and advise. The emperor held him in high regard. The *Sāmén* (Buddhist monks) resented his favor, and *Gāolìshì*, who had long served the *Fútóu* (Buddhist) sect, together defamed him before the emperor. He then requested to return to *Sōngshān*, and the emperor decreed the establishment of a pavilion for him.\n\nHe expounded on the *mysteries of the Grain Spirit* (*Gǔshén*), producing *The Treatise on the Xuángāng*. Mournful for the *blue-pine heart* and *withered gaze* of those distant from the Dao, he wrote *The Treatise on Immortality as a Learnable Art*. He composed *The Heart-Washing Ode* and *The Éxī Retreat Ode* to clarify the *transcendent purity* and *liberation from worldly entanglements*. His works on cultivating sincerity within the chest to rest in *Tianjūn* (Celestial Balance) include *The Theory of Heart and Mind* and *The Hymn of Divine Accord*. His poems on *wandering among immortals*, *treading the void*, and *mixed reflections on royal governance* total over four hundred and fifty, collected and prefaced by *Guān Déyǔ*.\n\nLater, he attained *spiritual dissolution*, and the emperor posthumously honored him as **Master Zōngyuán**. His works were compiled by **Liú Zhīgǔ**, styled **Xiānxián** (Celestial Hidden), a native of *Pèi*. A descendant of the *Zhèng King of Zhōngshān*, his ancestors served as officials in *Línqióng*, and the family settled there. His mother, of the *Hào* clan, conceived him after a divine dream, and she was endowed with wisdom and virtue, taking no delight in worldly gain or fame. She devoted herself solely to the Dao, later joining the *Tàiqīng Guān* (Great Clarity Monastery) and receiving the *sāndòng jīnglù* (triple cave scriptures and talismans).\n\nShe mastered the *Bāgōng Bǎozhāng* (Eight Immortals’ Precious Scriptures), the *sāndòng bǎolù* (triple cave talismans), the *Dānjīng Màijué* (Alchemical Canon of Veins and Pulse), and the *shēngshēng rùsǐ* (methods of birth-and-death transcendence), all without exception. The *Ruìzōng* emperor summoned him for inquiry, and his Daoist attainments pleased the sovereign, who bestowed special honors upon him before he returned to his mountain.\n\nDuring the *Kāiyuán* era, he was summoned again to alleviate the people’s suffering. As a *Zhēnrén* (True Person), he observed the *yùsè* (color of the complexion) and *dàimài* (pulse), dispersing *qì* to remove ailments. Eighteen out of every ten people benefited and found peace. The emperor’s gifts he declined, instead requesting permission to return to *Shù* (Sichuan), and he was granted a decree to establish his residence as the *Dàqiānqiū Guān* (Great Thousand Autumns Monastery). The emperor inscribed the name himself, and **Lǐ Yōng** composed the stele.\n\nLater, during the *Tiāncháng Jié* (Heavenly Length Festival), the monastery was renamed *Tiāncháng Guān* (Heavenly Length Monastery), and further arrangements were made for its expansion. When visitors came, he imparted the *Huángbái shù* (elixir arts of gold and silver). Though their dwellings were grand and splendid, costing tens of thousands, he never relied on human labor to complete them.\n\nVisitors returned, and he was advised by divine figures to dwell at *Dōngyáng Fùniú Shān* (East Yang’s Hidden Cow Mountain). Upon arriving, he found an ancient monastery renovated and ready for residence. He practiced the *sānbēn jiǔdào* (three sprints, nine methods) for ten years. Suddenly, a radiance filled his chamber, and a single *dānzhī* (elixir grass) sprouted, striking the stone beneath it and producing a resonant metallic sound. In a dream, a divine person told him: *\"Beneath the dripping spring of the mountain behind lies a stone where a golden fish crosses it—you may ascend to heaven with this.\"*\n\nHe was instructed that only this grass striking the stone would summon the fish. Later, he sought it out, and when he struck the stone with the grass, a thunderous force shook the earth. The massive stone cracked open, revealing the golden fish, three *chǐ* in length, which then soared into the sky, surrounded by swirling clouds and mists. The True Person once prayed for his mother’s blessings, placing nine *yōnghuā dēng* (lanterns of the Nine Abysses) in the *Jīn lù bái jiǎn* (golden talismans and white tablets) style, which remains in use to this day. The benefits to the *yōumíng* (netherworld) are immeasurable.\n\nHe also authored *The Celestial Pivot of Sun and Moon* and *The Song of Pointing Out Errors*, which circulate in the world.\n\nIn the *Xuān Hé* era of the *Shèngsòng* (Revered Song), the monastery was renamed *Xiānyǐn Guān* (Hidden Immortal Monastery), located within the northern city walls of *Chéngdū*.\n\n**Fù Liànshī** (Fù Xiānzōng), styled **Xiānzōng** (Immortal Ancestor), was from *Cháng’ān*. His father, **Lún**, served as the magistrate of *Zīyáng*. **Xiānzōng** from a young age took delight in Daoist learning, thus secluding himself at *Zīyáng Shān* (Resource Yang Mountain). Soon after, a divine person revealed to him that *Yù’àn Shān* (Jade Button Mountain) was suitable for cultivation, so he constructed the *Qiānlíng Guān* (Thousand Autumns Monastery) and resided there for a decade.\n\nOne day, several divine figures appeared and said: *\"Master, this mountain is our deity. Since you have taken up residence here, we have not known a moment’s peace, let alone this place being a blessed domain. The *Pínggāng Shān* (Flat Ridge Mountain) to the west of the prefecture is where you should dwell.\"* Heeding their words, the mountain spirits served as his attendants, and he built an altar and chambers at the site.\n\nWhen Emperor *Mínghuáng* championed the Dao, he summoned **Xiānzōng** to the court. Passing through *Lìzhōu*’s *Jiúpóbó Jīn* (Orange-Bamboo Ferry of Lì Prefecture), water demons plagued the locals. **Xiānzōng** inscribed two stone tablets with talismans and cast them into the water, whereupon two massive fish stranded on the shallows, their bellies bearing the inscription: *\"Red carp, red carp, dwelling in river waters, not avoiding the Immortal Officials—your fate is sealed by justice.\"* The prefectural magistrate reported this, and the emperor decreed the establishment of a shrine for **Xiānzōng** at the ferry.\n\nUpon arriving in the capital, he was assigned to preside over a *jiào* (ritual) at the *Shàngqīng Gōng* (Upper Clarity Palace). The emperor personally attended the altar. When **Xiānzōng** arrived, he requested the presence of the *Qīngtóng Jūn* (Youth Lord of the East) and his officials and attendants. In an instant, celestial soldiers filled the eastern side of the altar, and the emperor was filled with fear.\n\nAfter the ritual concluded, he asked **Xiānzōng** how he had achieved such power. **Xiānzōng** replied: *\"My cultivation focuses solely on pacifying the people and benefiting all things. I maintain a tranquil and unadorned simplicity, clear as still water, undisturbed as a calm mind. Thus, I overcome myself.\"* The emperor was deeply moved and pleased.\n\nIn time, he requested to return to his mountain, and the emperor ordered the expansion of his monastery, personally inscribing the name and renaming it *Yìngzhēn Guān* (Responding to True). On the fourteenth day of the tenth month in the third year of *Qiányuán*, he suddenly heard a voice from the sky: *\"The Most High commands your return.\"* He bathed, ascended his platform, and attained *spiritual dissolution*. Some saw him in *Jiǎnzhōu*, riding a green donkey as he departed—this was surely an instance of *shījiě* (body dissolution).\n\n**Lǘqiū Xiānshēng** (Lǘqiū Fāngyuǎn), styled **Dàfāng** (Great Rectitude), was from *Yùn* (Yun). At sixteen, he mastered the *Classics and Histories*. At twenty-nine, he entered the Dao, studying under **Yóu Yuánzé**.",

Non-action means that when one speaks of 'non-being,' one attains emptiness (*kong*); when one speaks of 'being,' one meets obstruction (*zhe*). Grasping both being and non-being leads to stagnation (*zhi*). Only when you harmonize being and non-being, extinguishing all thought and resting in thoughtlessness (*wu xin*), will you approach the Dao. And indeed, the Master Shakyamuni (释氏) established this as the foundation of the Zen School (禅宗).*\n\nConfucius said: *\"The stillness that does not move—its measure is singularity (一).\"*\n\nThe Master Lao further asked: *\"What is that which, when faced, has no front, and when followed, has no back? What is this thing?\"*\n\nIf you can grasp this in silence, what more do you need to seek? Why must you dwell beneath the long pines of an empty mountain?

      "translated_text": "For his time, he was a renowned Confucian scholar, yet failing the *million-word essay* examination, he turned to the Dao/Way, becoming a foremost disciple of **Yìng Shì** (Responding Master). He once remarked that the Daoist teachings and rituals, since compiled by **Hàn Tiānshī** (Han Heavenly Master) and **Lù Xiūjìng** (Lu Modesty of the Pure), had over time fallen into disuse and decay. Thus, he scrutinized their authenticity, systematically recording their origins, and so the Daoist clergy across the land followed his arrangements to this day.\n\nEmperor **Lǐzōng** summoned him to serve as a literary draftsman in **Lín Dé Diàn** (Lynx Virtue Hall). At the time, he was praised as saying:\n*\"A forest of words, a sea of learning;\nUpholding the lineage, establishing the teaching—\nthe foremost under heaven.\"*\n\nDuring the **Zhōnglǐ** era, he accompanied the imperial procession to Shu, where he grew old in **Chéngdū**. When **Wáng Jiàn** ruled Shu, he summoned him as a teacher for the royal prince. He once told **Xú Guāngbù** (Xu Broad Virtue), *\"In my youth, I studied at the imperial university, where all texts were available. Within a month, I divided each day’s study:\nThe first day, I recited the Classics;\nThe second, I read the histories and commentaries;\nThe third, I practiced composition;\nThe fourth, I recorded anecdotes;\nThe fifth, I rested leisurely to cultivate my will.\nThis cycle completed in five days, repeated monthly.\nIn less than five years, I mastered all the texts.\"*\n\n**Guāngbù**, the Shù chancellor, had once been his disciple.\n\nThe Heavenly Master first encountered the **Chén Tǐ** (Body of Truth) scripture and later obtained divine elixirs. In **Chéngdū**, he resided at **Zhū Xiān Yīn** (Jade Immortal’s Retreat), where his teachings resonated widely. In autumn, he declined further invitations and never met again. One day, he suddenly told his disciples, *\"Last night, I dreamed of presenting myself to the Celestial Sovereign as the overseer of Mín Yuè (the sacred peaks).\"* At that time, the **True Palace** was being constructed on **Qīngchéng Shān** (Green City Mountain), and its completion was announced. He then donned his ritual robes, performed farewell rites, and ascended the hall, bidding his disciples farewell before attaining *spiritual dissolution* (*huà*). His remains were buried on **Qīngchéng**, but his coffin was found unusually light—upon opening it, only a single sandal remained.\n\nHe authored numerous works, including the *Hùnyuán Tú* (Mixed Primordial Diagram), *Yìjì Shèngfù* (Sacred Ode of the Epoch), *Guǎngshèng Yì* (Expanded Sacred Meaning), *Lìdì Jì* (Record of the Imperial Lineage), *Língyàn Jì* (Record of Miraculous Verifications), *Kējiào Yífàn* (Ritual Standards of Teachings), *Zhāngcí Biǎoshì* (Models of Chapters and Proclamations), and hundreds of songs and miscellaneous writings, collectively titled *Guǎngchéng Jí* (Collection of Broad Achievement).

In the **Kāibǎo** era (968 CE), Emperor **Tàizǔ** stationed in **Zhèn Yáng**, summoned him to the palace. The emperor said, *\"Master, you are over eighty yet appear youthful—this is the art of nurturing life. Please instruct me.\"* **Chéngyǐn** replied, *\"My method of nurturing life is no more than refining thought and cultivating the spirit. For rulers, the path differs.\"* He cited **Lǎozǐ**:\n*\"If I act without action, the people transform themselves;\nIf I desire nothing, the people return to simplicity.\nWithout action, without desire—\nthe spirit merges with the Great Harmony.\"*\n\nThe emperor praised his words and bestowed extraordinary honors.\n\n**Zhāng Wúmèng** (Zhang Dreamless)\n**Zhāng Wúmèng**, styled **Língyǐn** (Hidden Forest), was renowned for his filial piety.

He gained profound insights. Afterward, he wandered to **Tiāntái Shān** (Heavenly Terrace Mountain) and **Chìchéng** (Scarlet City), dwelling there for over a decade. His cultivation was refined, and he expressed his inner truths in poetry, composing *Hái Yuán Piān* (Hundred Verses of Returning to the Primordial) with a hundred stanzas. **Xià Yīnggōng** (Summer Noble Lord) visited him in the mountains, obtaining the poems to present at court. **Wáng Jìgōng** (Wang of Ji), as chancellor, received the poems and later submitted them to the throne.\n\nEmperor **Zhēnzōng** inquired about strategies for longevity. **Wúmèng** replied, *\"I am a rustic—only reciting the *Lǎozǐ* and *Zhōuyì* in the mountains.\"* The emperor commanded him to lecture on the *Yìjīng*, and he expounded on the **Jiǎn** (Modesty) hexagram. The emperor asked, *\"Why only the Modesty hexagram?\"* **Wúmèng** answered, *\"In times of great abundance, one must govern with modesty.\"* The emperor delighted in his words and offered him the post of **Zhuózhuò Zuǒláng** (Literary Draftsman), which he declined. Later, the emperor summoned him again to lecture on *Hái Yuán Piān*, offering wine and gifts, which he also refused. The emperor then bestowed the title **Chùshì Xiānshēng** (Recluse Master), which he declined as well. The emperor composed a poem in reply:\n\n*\"The Dao of Mixed Primordial contains pure essence,\nObserve it—no trace, listen—no sound.\nOnly the enlightened attain this truth,\nAdrift beyond the world, immersed in stillness.\n\nFloating clouds unfold beyond ordinary form,\nFlowing water circles without fixed shape.\nOn impulse, I left the mountain’s gate,\nTo discuss the Dao, I briefly visited the royal court.\nWith the wind, I heard the essence of the lineage,\nReturning to the stone, I sought my natural ease.\n\nJade and silk, cap and sash—unworthy of my regard,\nI sang long and now return with imperial favor.\nThe next day, I departed by decree,\nThe court ordered my stipend from Tàizhōu—\nI did not request it.\nThus, my life’s end was pure and untainted.\"*\n\nHe died at ninety-nine in **Jīnlíng**. Three days later, white *qi* emerged from his crown, rising three feet high. His *Jūn Tái Shī* (Jade Terrace Poems) circulated in the world. His disciple, **Bìxū Zǐ** (Azure Void Child) **Chén Jǐngyuán** (Chen Scenic Element), inherited the essence of **Lǎozǐ** and **Zhuāngzǐ**.\n\n**Liú Shì** (Master Liu)\n**Liú Cóngshàn**, styled **Shùnfū** (Obedient Husband), from a young age, favored Daoist learning. He took ordination at **Jiànlóng Guàn** (Observing Dragon Hall). In the early **Tiānshèng** era, he resided at **Jǐnglíng Gōng** (Scenic Spirit Palace) by imperial decree. The emperor and empress desired to receive Daoist initiation. **Shàoguān Miào Shì** (Mysterious Observation Master) **Zhū Zìyīng** (Zhu Self-Cultivation) established an altar at **Yùqīng Zhāoyìng Gōng** (Jade Purity Responsive Palace), commanding **Cóngshàn** to participate in the ritual. The emperor was strict in filial offerings, sending envoys to instruct him on the taboo dates of the late emperor, ordering him to recite incantations before the deities during the ritual meal.\n\nThus, **Cóngshàn** compiled the incantation formulas from the **Sāndòng Jīng** (Three Caverns Scriptures) and later submitted the ritual texts. The emperor praised him, bestowing the title **Quánsù** (Complete Purity), and ordered his compositions to be inscribed in all Daoist halls. The ritual of *zòushí* (ritual meal offerings) originated with him. When the **Yánníng Gōng** (Serene Peace Palace) was completed, many submitted poems for the imperial portrait’s five-viscera inscriptions, but only **Cóngshàn’s** met with approval. His text was engraved on gold and jade plaques.\n\nWhen Emperor **Rénzōng** fell ill, he summoned **Cóngshàn** to present petitions inside the palace, commanding officials to relay his words. After kneeling and presenting his memorial, the emperor asked, *\"Did your words reach me?\"* He replied, *\"They have reached you.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Petitioner’s Humble Words\n\nI have heard that the **Supreme Immortal of Tranquil Stillness** acts without doing yet responds perfectly; the **Mysterious Void Dao** ever subtly communicates through attunement. Without sincere invocation of the **Numinous Methods**, how could one aspire to the **Sacred Workings**?\n\nNow that the **Sacred Altar** has been established and the **Rite of Purification** is about to commence, I first humbly pray to the **Celestial Spirit**, then unfold the **Dao’s Precepts**. May it penetrate the **Nine Heavens above**, so all may hear and know; may it illuminate the **Three Realms below**, so all may be moved and respond. May the **Supreme Virtue** be broadly bestowed, encompassing all sentient beings.\n\n**The Yellow Register Rite’s Sacred Petitionary Text**\nThe **Yellow Register Sacred Rite**, the **Purple Yang Secret Pattern**, above can **stabilize Heaven and pacify Earth**, below can **protect the nation and bring peace to the home**. It rescues the living and saves the dying, extends life and delivers from peril—held in reverence by the **Ten Thousand Heavens**, followed by the **Thousand Saints**. Its teachings unfold across the **Nine Periods**, drawing from the **Nine Yang Numbers**; its altar is structured in **Three Levels**, branching into the **Three Qi Blossoms**. It aligns the **Eight Trigrams** with the **Eight Directions**, fixes the **Ten Celestial Stems** in their **Ten Positions**. It opens the **Heaven Gate** and the **Earth Portal**, the **Ghostly Path** and the **Human Way**. The **bows and flags**, **mirrors and swords** are arrayed in solemn order; the **trays and vessels**, **earthen jars and gourds** are offered in humble simplicity. Thus does it **model Heaven and mirror Earth**, **communicate with the True and summon the Spirits**.\n\nWe, the petitioners, now begin our **first reverence**, our **initial homage**. Before the **Jade Stair’s** infinitesimal space, we dare not be disrespectful; beneath the **Celestial Countenance’s** near presence, we stand as if already above. We humbly pray that the **Three Pure Ones and Ten Extremes**, the **Ten Thousand Saints and Thousand Immortals**, temporarily leave the **Golden Gate’s** lofty heights, descending to survey the **dusty world’s** confined depths. May this humble abode become the **Pure Capital’s** celestial residence, awaiting Your gracious descent—our reverence and longing know no bounds.\n\n**The Petitioner’s Words on the Rite’s Sacred Petitionary Text**\nThus, when the altar is first opened, the **Heavenly Gates** stand wide, the assembly is solemn and silent, our hearts pure and sincere. We emulate Heaven’s grandeur and Earth’s humility, arranging the **Heavenly and Earthly** in order; we gaze left to the **Ceremonial Standards**, right to the **Jade Carvings**, the gates aligning with **Sun and Moon**. We focus our intent within the **elaborate scriptures and ritual systems**, attuning to the **dim, elusive** yet **manifest** Spirits. With **seven days of abstinence** and **three days of fasting**, we honor the ancients’ devotion to the **Celestial Sovereign**; with **inner resolve and outward sincerity**, we pledge today’s unyielding honesty. We open the **Treasure Altar of All Marvels**, fulfilling the **past year’s and present wishes**, inviting the **feathered sages** to chant the **Deep Chapters**. The **Celestial Procession** ascends with thunderous might, the **Sacred Waters** flow like clouds and rain.\n\nWe humbly pray to the **Star Palaces and Moon Halls**, the **Vermilion Gates and Pure Capitals**, the **Deepest Mysteries**, the **Saints of the Triple Profound**. From the **Heaven of Heavens**, descending from the **Symbol Beyond Symbols**, You traverse the void with flying steps—**Zhi-Tong children** bearing **feathered banners** lead the way; **dragon chariots** and **wind-riding steeds** bring You swiftly down. You deign to observe the **fragrant offerings**, to accept the **humblest sincerity**, bestowing blessings on the living and the dead, extending mercy to the hidden and the manifest. We have already received the **Highest Spirit’s** oversight—how could we forget the **Great Response’s** omen? We await Your descent with reverent longing.\n\n**The Petitioner’s Words on the Altar’s Sacred Petitionary Text**\nAll **Three Realms’ responsive Spirits**, all **True Essences**, may You hear our petitions and descend to the **fragrant altar**. Having bathed in Your radiance, we now humbly present our earnest prayers. We envision the **celestial melodies**, the **feathered retinues** standing in solemn ranks. The **wind-blown canopy** and **cloud-borne palanquin** drift near; the **rainbow banners** and **vermilion flags** appear and vanish. The **Supreme Truth** descends to this mortal realm—the **Purple Palace’s** and **Cinnabar Sky’s** processions arrive. You pause at the **changing world**, the **Jade Pool’s** and **Moon Gate’s** splendor, temporarily halting the **phoenix carriage** to survey our sincere hearts, revealing our hidden devotion, and ascending to the **Great Workings**.\n\nI have heard that the **Dao ever responds to humanity**, Heaven ever listens below. With our **sincere devotion**, how could we neglect the **solemn beginning**? We exhaust our **inner sincerity** and **outer offerings**—the altar follows the **law’s measurements**, the **earthen jars** prioritize **substance over ornament**. The **sacrificial tokens** are arranged, each symbolizing the **Five Directions’ colors**; the **headgear and robes** are arrayed, dividing the **multitude’s ranks**. The **Dragon-Torch** flickers in **divine light**, the **incense beasts** congeal in **auspicious mist**. The **willow branches** are purified, the **flower petals** scatter in profusion. When the **high and low** take their positions, it is the moment of **Heaven and humanity’s mutual response**—**Heaven’s威** is near, the **clouds** rest in serene stillness, the **Spirits descend**, demanding utmost solemnity.\n\nWe humbly pray that the **Celestial Countenance** grant favor, the **Heavenly Gates** open wide, the **Ten Thousand Chariots** begin their journey, the **Hundred Spirits** guard the path. The **Lion and White Crane** bear the **Heavenly Standards** forward; the **Responding Dragon and Azure Qiu** guide the **Imperial Chariot** swiftly. May You not reject our **mortal sincerity**, so that the **rite’s purpose** may be fulfilled, and we may receive the **Saints’ descending grace**.\n\n**The Petitioner’s Words on the Sacred Petitionary Text for Inviting the True**\nFurthermore, we pray that the **Xiao-Shao melodies** lead the way, the **canopied carriages** follow behind. The **mist wraps the rainbow robes**, the **clouds float above the moon veils**; the **Wind Lord** clears the path, the **Rain Master** washes the dust. The **Celestial Procession** moves through the **Heavenly Roads**, scattering **treasure flowers** across the **Dharma Realm**. The **swift-flying retinues** descend to the **Dao Field**. We hope to glimpse You through the **dissipating mists**, to bare our hearts in **sincere entreaty**.\n\nNow, as the evening’s **sincere devotion** begins and our **earnest prayers** are presented, the **rites of welcome** are complete, and our **attunement** is without flaw. The **round altar** is arranged, the **ranks of High Immortals** take their places. The **group of Spirits** departs from the **Emerald Caverns and Jade Palaces**, the **assembly of Saints** descends from the **Golden and Jade Halls**. They bear **banners and canopies**, **treasure umbrellas** following the **celestial carriages**, their **clouds** ascending like **jade**, their **light** gleaming like **stars**. The **Celestial Countenance** is solemn, **dark robes** held in readiness to listen to mortal pleas; the **Tai Mountain’s** grandeur stands firm, **golden tablets** presented to inspect the **rite’s solemnity**. The **Southern Bureau** takes up the brush to record the **virtuous** for **rebirth**; the **Northern Bureau** awaits to inscribe the **meritorious** for **salvation**.",

family dedicated to the Dao,\nWho follows the *Nine Altars’* (九坛) traditions and rituals,\nWho observes the *Three Arrow* (三箓) rites of the Dao,\nAscending to the *Idyllic Heaven* (郁罗之天),\nEncompassing the *Heavenly and Earthly Realms* (乾坤之界),\nDescending to the *Abyssal Daoist Caverns* (洞渊之府),\nAnd reaching into the *Remote Northern Lands* (朔都之乡).\n\nWith a single thought, they resonate with the *True and Authentic* (真灵),\nAnd all spirits gather in response.\n\nTo the *Heavenly, Earthly, Watery, and Land-based* (天地水陆),\nThey pray and make offerings in all directions;\nThe spirits of mountains and rivers, of all lands,\nAssemble in the *boundless* (无方).\n\nI humbly pray that the *One True Spirit* (大恢得一之灵)\nMay come from the *boundless* (无方),\nTo fulfill the command of *summoning the True Person with the Jade Tablet* (碧简招真),\nAnd to join the ranks of *those who attend the Golden Portal* (金阙朝真),\nTo exalt the *Heavenly Auspices* (天休),\nAnd to safeguard the *imperial lineage* (国祚).\n\nMay they *seal the powers of life and death* (封掌生死),\nAnd open the *path of ease and convenience* (方便之门);\nMay they *grasp the balance of yin and yang* (把握阴阳),\nAnd ascend to the *Age of the Sovereign’s Supreme Dao* (皇极之世).\n\nI humbly pray that they may *temporarily dwell in the celestial chariot* (暂驻风云之驭),\nAnd *descend to partake in the offerings of the Daoist community* (俯歆苹藻之羞),\nTo *bestow blessings upon the solemn rites* (阴佑斋功),\nAnd to *fulfill the harmonious aspirations* (克谐愿望).\nMay they *extend their praise again* (再伸偈颂),\nAnd *touch the hearts of the mighty and numinous* (感格威灵).\n\nThe *emperors and kings* (帝王) study ancient traditions and emulate the *Heavenly Craft* (代天工),\nDifferent teachings converge in the *Great Central Dao* (建大中).\n\nThe *sovereign’s loyal ministers* (元首股肱) serve with unwavering devotion,\nAnd the *spirits and Daoist saints* (鬼神贤圣) are revered in equal measure.\n\nIn mortal rites, they honor the *ancestors and sages* (祀典思遗列),\nWhile in the celestial ranks, they *respond to the swift and mighty* (仙班答骏功).\nWith incense and fire offerings, they strictly adhere to the *broad Daoist precepts* (溥告),\nAnd pray to *align the celestial chariot with their sincere intentions* (愿驱云驭格精衷).\n\n**Second Degree: Inviting the Departed Souls**\nThe *wandering soul* (游魂) is restless, and the *Great Night* (大夜) never brightens.\nThey must *lean upon the Nine-Colored Golden Light* (必倾九色之金光),\nAnd *use the Iron Locks of Darkness* (用掣重阴之铁锁).\n\nThe *Great Dao is without obstruction* (大方无碍),\nAnd the *myriad laws are illuminated* (万法昭融).\nThe *Celestially Revered* (举天尊) proclaims:\n\nThere is a *formless substance* (有物混成),\nFrom which the *Sovereign* (皇) gives birth to *Heaven and Earth* (生天地).\nThe *round and clear* (圆清) and the *square and turbid* (方浊)\nWithin it give rise to humanity.\nThis is called the *Three Talents* (三才),\nEach possessing its *Daoist nature* (道性).\n\n*Heaven endures, Earth lasts* (天长地久),\nWithout beginning or end,\nThey *propel the flow of yin and yang* (推荡阴阳),\nAnd *divide the cycles of darkness and light* (裁割昏晓).\nThe *uninterrupted breath of qi* (一气不息)\nGives birth to all forms (万形以生),\nDistinctly manifesting as *divinity* (卓然有神),\nKnown as the *Creative Transformation* (造化).\n\nHumans dwell within it,\nAbove, aligned with the *Two Principles* (两仪) of Heaven and Earth,\nThough noble and humble differ,\nThe *virtuous and the foolish* (贤愚) are distinguished.\n\nWhat they receive from this source,\nIs the *same initial essence* (一初).\nThey *embrace yin and hold yang* (负阴抱阳),\nWith *round heads and square feet* (圆首方趾).\n\nFrom infancy, they *preserve their pure spirit* (精守神全),\nTheir *Heavenly Truth* (天真) untainted,\nTheir *mixed and primordial state* (混沌) unbroken,\nThey do not covet wealth and nobility,\nNor do they scorn poverty and lowliness,\nThough they possess *sentience and knowledge* (含识知),\nTheir essence remains *pure and untainted* (纯粹精白).\nThis is the *True and Authentic Nature* (真实性),\nWithout *deceit or falsehood* (无邪伪心),\nAnd to be born as a human is what is most precious.\n\nAs they grow older,\nTheir bodies interact with the world,\nGradually losing their *Heavenly Truth* (天真),\nAnd being *corrupted by human desires* (熏煎人欲).\nThe *innocence of childhood* (赤子之性) diminishes day by day, month by month,\nEndless beings arise,\nEndless streams of existence flow,\nYet they only *pursue worldly attachments* (务逐物),\nAnd do not *know the love of origin* (爱缘).\n\nHow few recognize that this body,\nAbove, is aligned with *Heaven and Earth* (配天地),\nThat it *originates from the womb* (始从胎育),\nAnd *descends from the Nine Heavens* (降气九天).\nWhen the *ten months are complete* (十月既圆),\nAll *ten thousand spirits* (万神) guard it.\nOnce the form is born,\nThe *seven orifices* (七窍) open,\nThe *nine palaces* (九宫) are arranged upon the head,\nWhere the *Nine True Spirits* (九真) reside,\nThe *five viscera* (五藏) are divided within,\nEach with its own *spirit* (神).\n\nThe *Three Souls* (三魂) dwell in the liver,\nDesiring that humans act virtuously.\nThe *Seven Spirits* (七魄) reside in the lungs,\nDesiring that humans act wickedly.\nThe *Twenty-Four True Spirits* (二十四真),\nAre divided among the *three departments* (三部):\nThe *Purple Gates and Jade Pavilions* (紫户玉阁),\nThe *Crimson Palaces and Vermilion Fields* (绛宫丹田),\nAnd within, the *True Person* (真人),\nKnown as the *Innocent Child* (赤子),\nWhere *ten thousand Heavenly Spirits* (天地神气) and *thirty-six thousand* (三万六千)\nConverge—every *joint and subtle mechanism* (关节机微)\nIs under their control.\n\nHow noble is the human body!\nMost noble is the *One True Spirit* (一真),\nThe *original essence* (初生),\nPure and untainted,\nAnd humans, in their worldly existence,\nEach know how to *preserve their own* (自存).\n\nThe *divine spirits within the body* (周身中神) rejoice and surge.\nThe *stars upon the crown* (顶戴之星)\nShine brightly and

the fire dates of mingled hues,\nNearly taken from the self, distantly drawn from things.\n\nIf the heart-field’s purity is clear and bright,\nThen fruits flourish in abundance;\nOr if thorns and brambles grow thickly,\nThen roots and shoots wither away.\n\nTheir color like citrus, yet sweet as honey,\nSome ripen after years, others at their appointed time,\nSome take three thousand years to form,\nSome mature in an instant’s flash—\nChewing them, the spirit feels invigorated,\nSavoring them, the mind becomes lucid and clear.\n\nIf the fruit arises from its cause,\nThen one must discard the flower and focus on the essence.\nAt this moment, the mind is fully illuminated.\nThrough this praise, boundless support is extended.\n\nI offer the Seven Heavenly Sacred Fruits of *Qiónglín*:\nThe *Kōngdòng* spirit-gourd,\nThe *Wànsuì* immortal peach,\nThe *Jīnzhǐ* golden dates,\nThe *Yuánguāng* primal essence fruits,\nThe *Chìlíng* crimson spirit dates,\nThe *Fēidān* flying alchemy pomegranates—\nTheir fragrance thick and pervasive,\nEating them brings endlessness,\nCirculating through the Ten Directions,\nExtending boundless support.\n\n**Food:**\nHeavenly and human sustenance, bland and flavorless,\nRecorded in the *Huángtíng* scriptures;\nThe *Shūmǐ* millet grains,\nRefined without remainder, their merit marked in *Língbǎo*.\nThus the highest sages,\nOnly savor the *Chōnghé* balanced taste;\nWhile those descending to the mortal realm,\nIndulge in rich delicacies to repel demons.\n\nThe Four Heavenly Fragrant Rice of the celestial kitchen,\nBorn from the common folk’s grains;\nYet the world’s hundred varieties of rice and millet,\nEach kernel earned through toil and suffering.\n\nThose who enjoy blessings without laboring to eat,\nShould reflect on their origins;\nThose who have abundance yet know contentment,\nMust not cast it away lightly.\n\nIn this *Fǎhuì* assembly of sacred practice,\nI prepare the *Huìxiāo* fine offerings.\nThus I present these fragrant feasts,\nTo nourish the departed spirits.\n\nThrough this praise, boundless support is extended.\n\nI offer the Four Heavenly Fragrant Rices:\n*Fēngshān* Abundant Mountain Rice,\n*Lóngshān* Dragon Mountain Rice,\n*Qīngjīng* Verdant Essence Rice,\n*Tàihé* Grand Harmony Rice—\nTheir fragrance thick and pervasive,\nEating them brings endlessness,\nCirculating through the Ten Directions,\nExtending boundless support.\n\nThe *heart-flower* of wisdom’s fruit,\nThe *golden rice* and *jade nectar*,\nThe *Língbǎo* spirit’s fragrant wisdom,\nThe *pífēn* subtle dharma-flavors—\nAll rely on things to manifest the Dao/Way,\nYet one should perceive the mind through their form.\n\nEach should offer sincere and expansive devotion,\nTurning it into boundless merit.\nMay all beings on the great earth attain fullness,\nNo creature left unnourished by its essence.\n\nFurther, through fitting praise,\nTo complete the awakening.\n\nHearing the *Fǎnwèi* wisdom’s radiance in the *Tàiwú* boundless void,\nThe *round penetration* of all mysteries;\nRefining the true light within the dharma-body,\nSavoring the *Chōnghé* balanced taste.\n\nAble to draw sufficiency from all forms,\nInitially not dependent on external things.\n\nAfter the *spirit-food* incantation,\nI hope for your departed soul,\nTo absorb the *Língmáng* luminous essence of the inner landscape,\nTo steady the central *zhōngzhuàng* true position,\nTo drink the *Qióngguì* dewdrops of the spirit-tree,\nTo eat the *Huánghuá* golden petals’ jade-like tenderness,\nTo grasp the Dao’s profound mysteries,\nTo congeal the spirit in the boundless expanse,\nTo rest in the *yuánfáng* primal chamber and lie at ease,\nTo aid the true transformation in its boundless circulation.\n\nOffered to the departed,\nTo merit their rebirth in the heavenly realms.\nRecite the *Yùqīng Dàcí* Great Compassionate Sovereign’s *Gānlù* Nectar Law-Food Incantation:\n\nTurn back and gaze upon the *Yuánluó* round canopy,\nUniting the scene and drawing the luminous essence.\nConfining the soul, restraining the seven *pò*,\nFocusing the mind, centering the *zhōngzhuàng*.\nMoving, dwelling, walking in the boundless void,\nSleeping, resting in the *yuánfáng* primal chamber.\nHunger, feast on the *Huángbì* golden petals;\nThirst, drink the *Qiónggēn* dewdrop nectar.\nThe spirit-banners command the *tiān mó* heavenly demons,\nUniting the body, refining the true light.\nOnce more illuminating the *Tàiwú* boundless void,\nEndlessly dwelling in the mid-air realm.\nRound penetration fades at the *bōjí* wave’s edge,\nTrue transformation knows no final limit.\nProfound mysteries without beginning or end,\nThe practitioner must clearly understand.\nSilent and vast, forgetting teachings and precepts,\nResponding to the *yùn* cosmic flow, vast and unconstrained.\nThe Dao’s mirror does not shine by itself,\nIt must first be polished by what is offered.\nUnion finds no duality,\nSeparation follows the heart’s will.\n\nNow mingled in the *mángwèi* murky and luminous,\nTransformation not yet riding the single *qì* breath.\n\nTo reverse their original knowledge,\nForm must arise from the *sān guāng* Three Lights.\nAppropriate to sing and chant in the *qīngyáo* clear melodies,\nTo unfold the path of birth and rebirth.\n\nAfter the *spirit-food* incantation,\nI hope for your departed soul,\nTo embrace the *yīn* and cradle the *yáng*,\nTo draw the *rìyuè* sun-moon’s ascending *bēn* vital qi,\nTo mold the soul and cast the spirit,\nTo store the *kǎnlí* water-fire’s constructed essence.\nThe Three Palaces full and replete,\nThe Ten Aspects complete—\nEarly ascending to the *tōngdá* realm of boundless passage,\nEndlessly roaming the *zhìhuì* gate of wisdom.\n\nOffered to the departed,\nTo merit their rebirth in the heavenly realms.\nRecite the *Sānguāng* Three Lights Illuminating the Nectar Law-Food Incantation:\n\nVast and crystalline, the *yuángì* primal qi is born,\nPerfusing the *tàikōng* great void.\nThe two *yào* luminaries shine together,\nThe five *wéi* constellations harmonize in turn.\nThe Three Lights radiant, their brilliance complete,\nSacred qi fills the Three Palaces.\nThe imperial domain gathers the *jiǔlǎo* Nine Elders,\nFeasting on the *bǎitǐ* hundred forms of abundance.\nThe *Jīnhuá* golden petals illuminate the scene,\nBody aligned with the sun and moon.\nIn thought of the Dao, before the highest sages,\nEndless life through ten thousand kalpas.\nHeavenly beings nurture the people,\nAccumulating the *sānwānliùqiān* thirty-six thousand divine qi;\nThe world abandons the Great Dao/Way,\nDestroying the *yībǎiliùshí* one hundred and eighty spirit-gates.\nSelf-corruption damages the true roots,\nNo nourishment blooms in the jade tree.\nThe spirit does not grant itself,\nThe shadow wanders with demons.\n\nTo reverse the source of life,\nOne must rely on the *fàn* sacred chant.\nAfter the *spirit-food* incantation,\nI hope for your departed soul,\nTo obtain the *zhònghuà* myriad transformations’ primal essence,\nTo restore the five *shén* spirits’ true dwelling,\nThe *Bái Yuán* White Sovereign on the right as guardian,\nThe *Gōngzǐ* Prince on the left as support,\nThe crown adorned with the *fēicùi* floating emerald canopy,\nThe feet encircled by the *jīnlián* golden lotus.\nFragrant clouds enfold the body,\nSweet nectar sprinkles the heart,\nThe *zhànhuǎng* profound and elusive primal spirit,\nNourishing the *xīyí* subtle true qi.\n\nOffered to the departed,\nTo merit their rebirth in the heavenly realms.\nRecite the *Yùqīng Dàbēi* Great Compassion Cloud Palace’s *Yīnshēng* Dark Birth Incantation for the *Fànchàng* Sacred Chant and *Shēnghún* Soul-Bathing:\n\nThe cloud-root boundless, the myriad transformations’ essence,\nThe seven *pò* spirits congealed within,\nThe three *hún* souls inwardly knotted.\nThe *èrshí sì zhēn* Twenty-Four True Ones,\nEnter and exit without gate.\nThe profound and elusive essence,\nThe profound and elusive primal spirit.\nFollowing the *jié* kalpa’s rise and fall,\nBorn with the *qì* breath.\nInternally congealed in the *hùnpò* mixed simplicity,\nExternally nurtured by the seven *jīng* channels.\nThe five *shén* spirits planted in the *huá* petals,\nThe three *tái* platforms spread with luster.\nThe *zǐquè* purple gate and

      "original_text": "鹤林道士吕太古集 读导篇 广成先生《赞导仪序》云：经科所称，斋官之内，谓行斋道官也，今误为斋主。 以道德尊高者为法师，即高功也明练法度为都讲，赞唱导引，法则轨仪，皆其职也。 欲令群官整肃，仪轨森然，须先呜鼓击磬。 齐众而后，陛坛赞唱。 或都讲年德稍高，不欲一一劳止，即於众官之内，补一人执磬唱礼。 盖事出一时，元非古制。 今知磬是也，已着为定式久矣。 盖古仪尚简，今法事烦多故也。 高功法师，职在敷奏，进止俯仰，居众之先。 或昏耄不任，自可求退，不可委之他人，翻类冗职。 监斋秉执科宪，弹纠愆达。 若有亏犯，预须以罚简告之。 受罚之人，亦须甘心伏罪，不得使禅纠之际，彼此谊然取笑，众人贻咎。 玄圣侍经，则检校坛场，主张法席。 经科几按，供养所须，施利敷张，皆须整治。 况旧法於斋堂之内，即今之坛场也。 置两高坐，三时讲赞。 自法师以下明经者，请升法座。 至诵经之时，众官既坐，一人行净，侍香行香，侍经行经。 诵经既毕，收经安置，安於斋堂之中，严持供养，不得虚参职任，使几案纵横，坛场污杂，并外人凌冒，轻触神真。 侍香所职，具在简词，近者因循，多不供职。 侍灯唯在勤励，兴废合仪，彻曙续明，斯为称职。 近有不经之士，不使侍经整饰坛筵，别置直坛之号。 今之直坛，昔之侍经是也。 六职之外，颇有冗员。 盖由蜀中於古仪之外，又有外坛法事，非众职兼为。 事有怀旷，遂令三侍兼宣词忏，分行外坛，致使侍经、侍香、侍灯本职者，而不问事。 虽分委职事，亦须法事之服。 当与检按，庶合仪轨尤佳。 又按金箓古仪，及黄箓旧法，宿启之夜，及言功之时，皆先作自然朝，即礼十方，忏悔三礼是也。 然后行事。 故启斋仪轨，止是戌时，迎官列位於玄师前，一人读职状讫，即投词于正坛，上十方香，升内遗，上香，礼师，发炉，下俯伏，依然朝。 次读斋词，大谢后宣戒。 都讲署职之官，受职宣科禁，发愿，复炉，出户至玄师前补向。 所以云：须明旦晨晓，依法行道。 此法自张天师、陆简寂、寇天师、张清都，相传至今，颇历年代，皆以斋法出於自然朝，示不忘本也。 近有庸流，不达古贤之情，先於玄师前，补署六职，宣科授简，然后升坛，仍云简寂先生斋法谬误。 饰非谤说，词理纷然，寡识无知，一至於此。 尚有其党，相仿行之，不唯获乱法之愆，实亦受谤贤之罪。 达教君子，宜共斥之。 东瀛子杜光庭书。 历观古仪，并无祝香、庭参，并发奏。 杨公杰学士重修金箓仪节次，有祝香一节，乃是官道场之制班定。 上香拜讫，令表白道士一员，具斋意，祝香讫，然后退就玄师前补职。 今醮事祝香，则高功为之。 古仪非无参神，即宿启是也。 所以广成先生反覆论之。 是以补职说戒，居宣词之后，乃是先关告上真，启白修斋之意，初非降圣酌献之时。 自悟微子着《刊误论》，徇一己之见，乃云：岂有彻祭之后，方且补职说戒。 杨公杰承悟微之失，遂迁补职说戒於启事之先，大失历世宗师本旨。 今有参神，又有宿启，又有启坛之初，坛外关告，殆似屋下盖屋，屋上张盖者也。 行之既久，难以改更。 但直免坛下宿启，及三日清旦关告，亦稍通也。",
      "translated_text": "**Master Lü Taigu of the Crane Forest Daoist School’s *Reading and Guidance* Section**\n*Preface to the *Praise of the Guidance Rites* by Master Guangcheng*\n\nThe scriptures refer to **\"fasting officials\"** (*zhāiguān*) within the **ritual assembly**—those who practice the Dao of fasting. Today, this is mistakenly called the **\"fasting master.\"**\n\nThose of highest **virtue/power** (*dé*) and **Dao** are called **Lawmasters** (*Fǎshī*), equivalent to **High Functionaries** (*gāogōng*). Those well-versed in **ritual precepts** (*fǎdù*) serve as **Chief Lecturers** (*dūjiǎng*), responsible for chanting, guiding, and upholding the **rites and regulations**. To ensure the **officers** stand in order and the **ritual formations** stand solemn, the **drum and bell** must first be struck. Only then may the assembly gather, and the **Chief Lecturer** ascend the platform to chant.\n\nIf the **Chief Lecturer**’s years of **virtue/power** are slightly greater and they wish to avoid excessive labor, one may be appointed from among the officers to strike the bell and lead the rites. Though this practice arose from necessity, it is not the ancient custom. Now that the bell is established as fixed ritual, it has endured for long.\n\nAncient rites were simple, but modern rituals have grown elaborate. The **High Functionary** and **Lawmaster** lead the **supplications**, their bows and movements setting the example for the assembly. If they are aged or infirm, they may retire of their own accord—never should they be replaced by another, lest it appear as redundant office.\n\nThe **Supervisor of the Fasting** (*Jiānzhāi*) upholds the **ritual statutes** (*kēxiàn*) and corrects transgressions. If any offense occurs, they must first warn with a **penalty register**. Those punished must accept their guilt without grumbling, lest disputes arise during **ritual admonition**, bringing shame upon the assembly.\n\nThe **Divine Sage’s Attendant** (*Xuánshèng shìjīng*) oversees the **platform** (*tánchǎng*), arranging the **ritual seating** and ensuring all **offerings** are properly prepared. According to ancient practice, within the **fasting hall**—today’s **platform**—two high seats are placed for **morning, noon, and evening lectures**. Those who have mastered the scriptures below the **Lawmaster** may request to ascend the **Law Seat**.\n\nWhen the **scripture recitation** begins, once the officers are seated, one performs **purification**, while the **Incense Attendant** tends the incense and the **Scripture Attendant** holds the scripture. After recitation, the scripture must be carefully stored in the **fasting hall**, held in strict **veneration**, lest the tables be left disordered, the platform defiled, or outsiders trespass, lightly profaning the **Divine Worthies**.\n\nThe **Incense Attendant’s** duties are detailed in the **ritual register**, yet many today neglect them through laxity. The **Lamp Attendant** must diligently maintain the lamps—extinguishing and relighting them as needed—this alone fulfills their role. Recently, some unqualified individuals have excluded the **Scripture Attendant** from arranging the **platform**, instead establishing a **\"Direct Platform\"** (*zhítán*) title. Today’s **Direct Platform** is what was once the **Scripture Attendant’s** duty.\n\nBeyond the **six primary roles**, there are many redundant positions. This stems from **Sichuan’s** addition of **external platform rituals** beyond the ancient rites, which the officers did not originally perform. Due to neglect, the **three attendants** were made to also **recite repentance verses** and serve the **external platform**, leaving the **Scripture Attendant, Incense Attendant, and Lamp Attendant** unfulfilled in their own duties. Though divided among them, they must still wear **ritual attire** when performing **ritual duties**. This should be examined to align with proper **rites and regulations**.\n\nAccording to the **Golden Register’s** ancient rites and the **Yellow Register’s** old laws, on the **night of the vigil** and during **meritorious recitation**, one first performs the **Natural Morning Rites**—that is, **paying homage to the Ten Directions** and offering **three repentances**. Only then does the ritual proceed.\n\nThus, the **fasting ritual sequence** begins at **hour *xū*** (7–9 PM), when the officers are summoned before the **Mysterious Teacher** (*Xuánshī*). One reads the **office statement**, then casts the **petition** onto the **main platform**, offers incense to the **Ten Directions**, ascends to the **inner altar**, offers incense, pays homage to the **Teacher**, lights the **incense burner**, and bows in **morning reverence**. Next, the **fasting petition** is read, followed by the **Great Thanksgiving** and the **proclamation of precepts**. The **Chief Lecturer**, having received their office, recites the **scriptural prohibitions**, makes a **vow**, relights the burner, and returns to stand before the **Mysterious Teacher** once more.\n\nHence it is said: *\"At dawn’s first light, proceed according to the Dao’s law.\"* This method, transmitted from **Zhang Daoling**, **Lu Jianji**, **Kou Qingzhi**, and **Zhang Qingdu**, has endured through the ages, always maintaining that the **fasting rites** originate from the **Natural Morning Rites**, lest the source be forgotten.\n\nRecently, some mediocre scholars, failing to grasp the intent of the ancients, have **prematurely appointed the six offices** before the **Mysterious Teacher**, proclaiming the **scriptural prohibitions** before ascending the platform, then claiming that **Lu Jianji’s fasting rites** are erroneous. Their false praise and slander only serve to confuse—how little they know! Even their followers imitate this, not only disrupting the **ritual order** but also slandering the **worthy teachers**. Those who understand the **Dao’s teachings** should reject them.\n\n**Du Guangting of the Eastern Isles** writes: Examining ancient rites, there is no **\"incense blessing\"** (*zhùxiāng*), **\"courtly attendance\"** (*tíngcān*), or **\"proclamation of supplications.\"** When **Yang Xue**, the **Master of Letters**, revised the **Golden Register rites**, he included an **\"incense blessing\"**—this was the **official Daoist assembly’s** fixed order. After offering incense and bowing, a **declared Daoist** would state the **fasting intent**, then retire to stand before the **Mysterious Teacher** to assume their office. Today, during **ritual exorcisms**, the **High Functionary** performs the **incense blessing**.\n\nAncient rites were not without **spirit invocation**—this was the **vigil night**. Hence, **Master Guangcheng** repeatedly expounds upon it. Therefore, the **appointment of offices** and **proclamation of precepts** must follow the **recitation of petitions**, first informing the **Highest Truths** of the **fasting intent**—this is not the time for **descending blessings** or **offering libations**.\n\nSince **Master Wu Ruo** composed the *Critique of Errors*, he favored his own views, claiming: *\"How could one appoint offices and proclaim precepts only after the sacrificial rites conclude?\"* **Yang Xue**, following **Wu Ruo’s** mistake, moved the **appointment of offices** and **proclamation of precepts** to before the **ritual invocation**, greatly deviating from the intent of all past **lineage masters**.\n\nNow we have **spirit invocation**, **vigil night rites**, and **initial platform announcements** outside the platform—this is like **building a house beneath a house and a roof above a roof**. Though practiced for long, it is difficult to alter. At least, one might eliminate the **vigil night invocation** and the **three-day morning announcements**, which would be somewhat acceptable.",

Thus, the **ordination of the platform** should be conducted by the **Grand Invocation** alone.\n\nHowever, **Yang Zigong** (杨杰次公) states: *\"Appoint a Daoist of Wēiyí rank to ordain the platform.\"* This fails to recognize that the **Grand Invocation** itself is the **Wēiyí**. He further says: *\"Place the **Jian Water** (*Jiànshuǐ*) at the **door of the platform** (*dìhù*).\"* This overlooks the fact that the **Grand Invocation**’s designated position is already the **door of the platform**. If the platform does not face due north, it should be relocated accordingly.\n\n**White Invocation** (*Bái Shì*) and **spirit contemplation** (*Cúnxiǎng*) are to be performed.\n\n**Celestial Master Du** states: *\"The Wēiyí Master, wearing the **mystic cap** (*Xuánguān*) and **crimson robe** (*Zhànghè*), stands at the **door of the platform**, and the **White Invocation** (*Bái Shì*) is performed to present the received **scriptures and ordination credentials** (*Jīngzhuó*) for the **appointment of offices** (*Zhìzhí*).\"*\n\nI, **Subject [Name]**, humbly hear that none surpasses the **hundred spirits** (*bǎilíng*) in harmonizing **yin and yang** (*Yùnyáng*); yet none can equal the **Great Dao** (*Dàdào*) in **saving the realm and the family** (*Jìjiāguó*) or **communing with the luminous and the dark** (*Yōumíng*).",

Next, contemplate the **True Official** (*Zhēnguān*) in **crimson robes**, riding the **Nine-Phoenix Chariot** (*Jiǔfèng Chéng*) and the **Big Dipper**, descending to purify the defilements at the altar. Then, contemplate the **Seven Stars** covering your head with their handles pointing forward, lest they obstruct your vision.\n\nOnly then proceed with the **White Invocation**—though it is better to first contemplate the **Four Spirits** (*Sìlíng*) at your left, right, front, and rear, with the **Sun, Moon, and Five Stars** (*Rìyuè Wǔxīng*) above your head. This is from **Du Yi’s** method.\n\nUpon completing contemplation, pass the **tablet** (*jiǎn*) to the attendant. Next, **clasp the fist** (*wògù*), hands hanging naturally, and summon the **Four Spirits**.\n\n**Clasping the fist**: With the **thumb pressing the middle finger’s middle joint**, the other four fingers drawn into the palm.\n\n**Eastern Azure Dragon** (*Dōngfāng Qīnglóng*), essence of the **Horn and Kneecap** (*Jiǎo-Kàng*), exhales **clouds and suppressed qi**, roars with **thunderous voice**.

Having summoned the Four Spirits, they shall now **circle like a belt**, the **Sun clasped by the Moon** in motion.\n\nThe **Sixteen Divine Generals of the Nine Regions** (*Jiǔzhōu Shíliù Shénjiāng*) serve as my emissaries. Under the **Great Unity Star Lord** (*Tàiyī Xīngjūn*), there are sixteen divine generals who know the **calamities and blessings of the world**.

The **Heaven, Earth, and Water Officials** (*Tiāndì Shuǐguān*) share their auspiciousness.\n\nThe characters **Heaven, Earth, Water** (*Tiān-Dì-Shuǐ*) are stepped as **Ding, Gāng, and Sān Cái** (*Sāncái bù*), at the **sword-water** (*jiànshuǐ*), invoking **Yang Yi’s** method. The old rites speak of **Heaven, Earth, and Water Officials**, but **Yang’s** version is superior.\n\nNext, the **right hand grasps the sword**. The **Five Phases** (*Wǔxíng*)—**Fire, Wood, Water, Earth, Metal**—are in motion. My **rigid sword** commands and restrains **ghosts and spirits**. The **Twenty-Eight Constellations** (*Èrshíbāxiù*) array before my will. The **Seven Stars of the Big Dipper** (*Běidǒu Qīxīng*) flank and assist the **Numinous True One**.

The **thumb** (*大指*) then presses against the **middle joint of the middle finger** (*中指中节*). After releasing the **thumb** (*弹了大指*), he presses the **root of the second finger** (*第二指根*).\n\nThis is the **original Master’s seal and talisman** (*本师印诀*), invoking the **Six Jia and Six Ding** (*六甲六丁*), the **Four Celestial Gate Kings** (*四天门王*), the **Azure Dragon and White Tiger** (*青龙白虎*), and the **Vermilion Bird and Dark Tortoise** (*朱雀玄武*), arrayed in concentric ranks around him. Next, he invokes the **Earth and Land officials** (*土、地申奏官属*), who stand at the **Celestial Gate** (*天门*) awaiting command, each distinctly recognized.\n\nAfterward, he **proclaims the summons** (*宣召*), directing them with his intent (*入意指挥*), and concludes with the **dismissal and farewell invocation** (*发引遣表*).\n\nThe Master, with his **left hand forming the talisman** (*搯印诀*), raises his **two fingers** (*二指*) to summon the scripture. With his **right hand wielding the Threefold Fire** (*仗三昧火*), he strikes the **roots of his four fingers** (*四指根节*) and recites the **Sword-Water Incantation** (*剑水咒*). Upon finishing the incantation (*噀水讫*), he **plants the sword** (*卓剑*).\n\nAt the **right side of his seat** (*坐右*), he forms the **Sword Talisman** (*卓剑诀*), striking the **root of his middle finger** (*右手中指根节*) toward the sword. Next, he **burns incense** (*焚香*), repeating the earlier **talisman for divine transformation** (*仍搯前变神诀*), visualizing the **Three Platform Stars** (*三台星*) upon the **back of his thumb** (*大指背*), known as the **Seven-Star Talisman** (*七星诀*).\n\nAfter reciting the scripture and proclaiming the petitions (*念文宣牒讫*), he **dismisses the deities with incantations** (*遣牒诵咒*), invoking the **True Qi of the Great Sun** (*太阳赤气*), the **True Qi of the Great Moon** (*太阴白气*), and the **Three Platform Seven-Star True Qi** (*三台七星真气*), channeling them into the water (*流注水中*), and **drawing the qi with the sword** (*执剑取气*).\n\nUpon finishing the incantation (*噀水讫*), the Master **directs his tongue to the upper palate** (*以舌主上腭*), transforming it into a **Golden Bridge** (*化为金桥*), allowing the Earth and Land officials to **deliver their petitions directly to the Celestial Gate** (*令土地申奏，从桥上径达天门*).\n\nWhen the ritual is complete (*事讫*), he **restores the deities and offers repentance** (*还神回向*).\n\nExtracted from the *Heavenly Heart Orthodoxy* (*天心正法*), recorded as *White Announcement of the Deities* (*白事*).»",

Every matter must conform to proper ritual standards, without neglecting or abandoning the prescribed rites and procedures.\"*\n\nThe **Great Cavern Master**, Xie Fanglai, further says:\n\n*\"When performing high-level petitionary rites, one must face east and stand upright. Below the rank of *Dujian* (都讲), all should face west to form a single rank. Standing upright, holding the tally tablet and bowing respectfully, one must regulate one’s breath and steady one’s *qi*, speak in measured, modest words, and maintain simplicity in ritual language. One must not raise one’s voice harshly, nor indulge in excessive ornamentation. Words should be concise, and meaning must be clear—avoid artificial embellishments, lest sincerity be lost.\"*\n\n*\"In all supplications, one must first repent of one’s transgressions before reporting the matter.\"*\n\nZhang Wanfu again says:\n\n*\"When ascending the platform to practice the Dao, one must first purify with incense and water, known as *Dangji* (荡秽). To draw forth and seal the *qi*, one must also purify, known as *Bizhenqi* (闭真气). When ascending the platform, one must strictly follow the ritual procedures established by the two Masters Zhang and Du. Before performing any rites, one must first go before the **Mysterious Master** (*玄师*), arrange the ranks, and chant the Dao. Upon reaching the platform’s entrance, one must hold the incantation and circle counterclockwise before ascending the **Celestial Gate** (*天门*) and offering incense to the Ten Directions. Then, one proceeds to the uppermost rank and performs the rites there—never omitting the proper announcement at the base of the platform, for such an omission is unknown in the original traditions and deviates from their intent.*\n\n*\"Indeed, from the **Ritual Master** (*礼师*), the **Qi-Storing Master** (*存神*), and the **Furnace-Opening Master** (*发炉*), all are meant to harmonize the inner and outer *qi*. Only after the **Spirit Official** (*灵官*)’s solemn rites are completed does one then invoke the **Daoist rank** (*法位*) and petition the **True Saints** (*诸真圣*). The logic of the announcement is clear and direct—omitting the base-platform announcement leaves no room for doubt or confusion.*\n\n**Nighttime Entrance Incantation** (*夜入户咒*):\n*\"Standing to the left of the earthly entrance, thrice strike the teeth in reverence, and in secret invoke the **Four Bright Officials** (*四明功曹*), the **Dragon-Tiger Envoys** (*龙虎使者*), the **True One Originating Qi** (*正一生气*), and the **Attendant Pure Maiden** (*侍靖素女*).

It is also called the Palace of the Jade Emperor, each palace being one cun in depth, thus forming the Níhuán Dòngmíng Mirror, which completes the likeness of the Golden Flower Immortal. Once the visualization is complete, then recite the verses of the Stepping Through the Void Scripture.*\n\n*According to Master Dù’s established ritual, the Daoist Master of Exorcism is stationed at the Ghost Gate, facing west. The Grand Master is stationed at the Heavenly Gate, facing east, and each chants while visualizing the nine-colored circular luminosity and swallowing saliva to invoke the secret exorcism spells. From the High Functionary downward, each performs the visualization in turn. Since Master Yáng’s establishment of the Golden Talisman Ritual, the Master of Exorcism has been stationed at the Heavenly Gate. Now, no further changes are made; instead, each follows the prescribed method as recorded in the scripture. The Exorcism Spell reads:*\n\n*'Huángzhōng cè qì zhǎn yāo zōng,*\n*Chá zhì qiáng jīng duàn xié wēng.*\n*Tàishàng yǒu mìng Tàishàng fáng,*\n*jí chào běi dì yì yù gōng.*\n*Shòu chéng wēi lìng xuān máo wáng,*\n*wǔ qì wěng yù yǔ mìng chōng.*\n*Bì cáng yù wén fāng jiù lóng,*\n*sān tiān yùn míng liù tiān zhōng.*\n\n*Master Dù said: ‘This spell must be recited silently; do not let your own ears hear it. Violating this brings misfortune—be cautious, be cautious.’*\n\n*From the *Wǔ Fú Rén Niǎo Jīng*, Master Zhào Míngjǔ states: ‘Though divided into nine colors, the essence remains the Primordial Xuan Yuan alone. For the nine colors originate from the Three Qi—Qīng, Huáng, and Bái. If further divided into colors like Zǐ and Bǐ, it becomes overly complex and loses its simplicity. Thus, the Three Qi are divided into Nine Qi for the exorcism.’*\n\n**Explanation of the Exorcism Ritual**\n*Master Zhāng Wànfú of the Qingdū School says: ‘Before the Celestial Venerable spoke the scripture, the demon kings of the Three Realms and Ten Thousand Worlds were the leaders of all ghosts, wielding power and poisoning the world, harming living beings. After the Celestial Venerable spoke the scripture, the demons submitted and transformed, guarding the Dao and protecting the law. They restrained the myriad demons, safeguarding those who practice genuine cultivation, thus enabling their ascension into the ranks of immortals. Hence it is said: “Any who dare to obstruct those practicing genuine cultivation shall be slain by the Golden Axe and punished by the Great Queen of the Afterworld.” It is also said: “The Great Demon King, upholding the Ascended Immortal, has fully attained the Dao and now wanders the Three Realms, entering the Golden Gate.” And again: “The Eastern Extermination of demonic essences, the beheading of the Six Ghostly Chiefs—this is the meaning.” Thus, the invocation of demons refers to summoning the demon kings of the Ten Thousand Worlds to uphold the merit of the ritual, to restrain and subdue malevolent ghosts. The *Stepping Through the Void Scripture* states: “The demon kings respectfully receive the ritual’s command, thus able to attend the Celestial Assembly. Both celestial and demonic beings respect and protect, receiving great blessings in this world and the next. The scattered flowers express my vow, the clenched talisman summons the demon kings.”*\n\n**Refined Contemplation for Reciting the Scripture**\n*According to Master Dù’s ritual guidance, when reciting the scripture’s verses, one must reach the stage of silent, lawful contemplation. Then, the Master follows the scripture’s instructions, visualizing while reciting the spells. However, the ritual text does not specify the method of visualization; thus, it is recorded here according to Master Lu’s diagrams and instructions.*\n\n**Visualization and Spiritual Preservation from the *Dào Dé Jīng***\n*The *Tàijí Yǐnzhù* states: ‘When reading the *Dào Dé Jīng* of the Celestial Venerable, first burn incense, adjust your attire, and bow three times. Visualize the Primordial Daoist Master, the Celestial Venerable Lǎojūn, who in the past was the Primordial Daoist Master of the Riverbank, Yín Xiansheng. Recite the spells while visualizing:*\n\n*\"Xuán xuán zhì dào zōng,*\n*Shàng dé tǐ hóng yuán.*\n*Tiān zhēn suī yuǎn miào,*\n*Jìn yuán níhuán jūn.*\n\n*Though distant, the Celestial Venerable is near in essence—*\n*the Níhuán Palace, where the Jade Emperor resides,*\n*is the brain’s center. Its halls are adorned with seven treasures,*\n*its windows and doors self-illuminating.*\n*The ever-present purity and tranquility bring forth the True,*\n*ascending in the radiance, riding upon the purple clouds.*\n*The sun and moon shine left and right,*\n*eternal immortality is preserved within.*\n*The Seven Ancestors ascend to Heaven,*\n*through generations, they guard the Dao of Virtue and Power.*\n\n*Complete the recitation with thirty-six strikes of the teeth,*\n*thirty-six swallows of saliva,*\n*and visualize the Azure Dragon to your left,*\n*the White Tiger to your right,*\n*the Vermilion Bird before you,*\n*the Dark Tortoise behind,*\n*the Eight Trigrams Spirit Tortoise,*\n*and thirty-six lions arrayed ahead,*\n*the Seven Stars of the Head bowed inward,*\n*with the Dipper’s handle pointing forward.*\n*The five zàng-organs’ five-colored qi*\n*cover your body like a brocade pattern.*\n*The Three-One True Person stands before the scripture,*\n*your own Three Teachers arrayed in ten thousand chariots,*\n*guarding left and right.*\n*Once fully comprehended,*\n*then recite the scripture.*\n\n*The *Sìjí Kē* states: ‘When reading the scripture, let your heart and mouth move in harmony, your eyes see nothing else, your mind harbor no other thoughts. Complete each phrase without omitting or rushing the Celestial Venerable’s words—three violations bring blame.’*\n\n*The *Tàijí Yǐnzhù* states: ‘After reciting five hundred words of the scripture, strike the teeth three times, let the tongue moist the upper and lower lips, and swallow saliva three times—this prevents exhaustion.’*\n\n**Visualization and Spiritual Preservation from the *Dù Rén Jīng***\n*The scripture states: ‘On the day of practicing the Dao, bathe in fragrant water and purify yourself in seclusion. Facing east, strike the teeth thirty-two times, invoking the thirty-two heavens above. Bow thirty-two times in your heart, swallow saliva thirty-two times. Close your eyes and sit in still contemplation, your body resting within the three-colored clouds of Qīng, Huáng, and Bái. Within and without, all is dense and mysterious. Visualize the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, Lions, and White Cranes arrayed to your left and right. The sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber within. A circular luminosity forms at the nape, its light reflecting in the ten directions—thus, all is clear and distinct.\"*",
