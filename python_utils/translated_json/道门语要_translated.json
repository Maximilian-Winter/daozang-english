robes\n\nThe *Dao Gate’s* gate of *Total Holding* must be kept in mind—\nthe heart must dwell within the chest.\n\nFrom ancient times, the sages of the Three Teachings\nhave had but one secret, and this is it.\n\nCultivate the Dao with stillness and non-action,\nand all places and times are its domain.\n\nNo need to practice static meditation or empty contemplation—\nnature itself brings stillness where it will.\n\nThe Dao is originally natural, without beginning or end,\nwithout motion or rest.\n\nIf one would have no affairs of the heart,\none must first have no heart for affairs.\n\nNeither good nor evil should be weighed—\nwhat greater human desire than *Heaven’s Principle*?\n\nLike a mirror’s light without a mirror,\nit responds only when something comes.\n\nOriginally, perfect awareness is round and bright—\nwhy labor to refine oneself or restrain oneself?\n\nThe eyes are naturally luminous,\nyet even a speck of dust can obscure them.\n\nHeaven and Earth are originally boundless—\nwhat evil is there, and what cause for joy?\n\nThough it seems there is doing and making,\nits beginning and end are without trace.\n\nEven forced effort returns to naturalness,\nand marvelously enters the logic of non-action.\n\nNow that *Dao Gate Essential Speeches* is published,\nhere is a brief account of its intent.\n\n**Investigating the Origin of Nature and Life**\n\nThe *Yijing* speaks of the *Taiji*—\nfrom which arise the two principles.\n\nThe *Taiji* is *Nature* (*xing*),\nthe two principles are *Life* (*ming*).\n\nThough named differently,\nin reality, *Nature* is the master,\nflowing between yin and yang.\n\nYet *Nature* is without trace,\nwhile *Life* has subtle traces;\n*Nature* knows no birth or death,\nwhile *Life* has birth and death;\n*Nature* knows no beginning or end,\nwhile *Life* has beginning and end;\n*Nature* knows no motion or rest,\nwhile *Life* has motion and rest.\n\nBefore *Life* exists, the principle of *Nature* hangs vast in Heaven and Earth.\nOnce *Life* is born, the principle of *Nature* is already complete within the body.\n\nGreat is *Nature*!\nNothing can surpass it.\n\nYet without *Life*, *Nature* has no means to manifest—\nthus *Nature* and *Life* must be united, inseparable.\n\nFrom the moment of conception by one’s parents,\na point of luminous spirit is hidden within the embryo.\nThe primordial *Nature* transforms into the yin elixir of *li* (separation),\nthe primordial *Life* transforms into the yang lead of *kan* (abyss)—\nthis is called *original qi*.\n\nFrom this, water and fire rise and fall in alternation,\nspirit and *qi* intertwine, and heart and kidneys form.\nWith long nourishment, the fetus matures.\n\nThus, emerging from the womb,\none carves out one’s own heaven and earth.\n\nThough bound by form and substance,\none is not far from the original *qi* of Heaven and Earth—\nfor in ignorance and unawareness, without doing or making,\none’s distance from Heaven and Earth is not great.\nThus, the body grows daily, wisdom unfolds,\nand there are things known without knowing how.\n\nBy the time of twenty-eight years, the body is fully formed,\nand the *jin* (measure of weight) is complete.\nIf one does not know the art of returning,\none is swayed by customs,\nand desire arises, clinging to sounds and colors,\nwhile ambition stirs, galloping after honor and wealth.\n\nWhen the will is thus fixed,\n*qi* follows it,\nand when *qi* moves,\nthe spirit is affected.\n\nThus, inner turmoil and outer distractions ensue,\nthe spirit scatters, *qi* dissipates,\nand *Nature* and *Life* are lost.\n\nThose who seek to restore primordial *Nature* and *Life*\nmust first solidify the *qi* of later Heaven,\nand to solidify the *qi* of later Heaven,\none must first restore primordial *Nature* and *Life*.\n\nObserve the saints and immortals of past and present—\nwithout fail, they cultivated *Nature* to establish *Life*.\nThere has never been one who cultivated *Nature* without refining *Life*,\nor refined *Life* without cultivating *Nature*,\nyet clung to one side alone and succeeded.\n\nFor *Nature* is the root of *Life*,\nand *Life* is the stem of *Nature*.\nThough they differ in sequence,\ntheir practice cannot be one-sided—\nwhy do later scholars and monks\nso often lean toward *Nature* or toward *Life*,\nyet never achieve success and still fail to repent?\n\n*Nature* is the sovereign of the body,\n*Life* is its operation.\n\nIf one does not preserve essence and enrich *qi*,\nyet speaks of perfect awareness and round brightness,\nthen the body and *Life* perish—\nwhere then would *Nature* reside?\n\nIf one does not purify thoughts and seek the true,\nyet only burns elixirs and gathers herbs,\nthen the heart and *Nature* remain unseen—\n*Life* is preserved in vain.\n\nMoreover, Heaven in creating humans\nfirst establishes principle, then *qi*—\nwithout principle, it is like a tree without roots,\nhow then could it flourish?\n\nAnd in cultivating the Dao,\none must refine *Life* to perfect *Nature*—\nwithout *Life*, it is like a lamp without oil,\nhow then could it shine?\n\nIn summary, the Dao is fundamentally unified,\nand practice must be comprehensive—\nonly thus may one avoid falling into one-sidedness,\nand escape the reproach of \"excessive yang cannot thrive, lone yin cannot generate.\"\n\n**On the Reality of Essence, *Qi*, and Spirit**\n\nThe *Heart Seal Scripture* states:\nThe three supreme elixirs are spirit, *qi*, and essence.\n\nThus, the greatest medicine of the body\nis the greatest elixir of the body itself.\n\nThe scholar who refines these in sequence\nwill not fall into one-sidedness.\n\nWhen considering human birth,\nit begins with a point of original spirit\ndescending from emptiness into the embryo—\nthis is called *spirit generating qi*, *qi* generating essence.\nThus, ten months in the womb,\nthree years at the breast,\ntotaling 5,480 days,\nand only then does one complete the four great elements of the body—\nthis is the natural way of birth.\n\nBut to reverse aging, return to youth,\nand achieve true immortality,\none must refine essence into *qi*,\nrefine *qi* into spirit,\nand thus return to emptiness and unite with the Dao—\nthis is the work of alchemical transformation.\n\nIn essence, refining essence is not merely refining the essence of sexual intercourse,\nrefining *qi* is not merely refining the *qi* of breathing,\nrefining spirit is not merely refining the spirit of thought.\n\nOne must seek within the physical form\nwhere the primordial true essence originates,\nwhere the primordial true *qi* moves,\nwhere the primordial true spirit resides—\nonly then can elixir refinement succeed.\nOtherwise, it is but phantom elixir,\nhow could it endure unbroken?\n\nStill, refining essence must first refine the original essence,\nwhile not damaging the later Heaven’s sexual essence;\nrefining *qi* must first refine the original *qi*,\nwhile not injuring the later Heaven’s breathing *qi*;\nrefining spirit must first refine the original spirit,\nwhile not extinguishing the later Heaven’s thinking spirit.\n\nThe primordial Dao is the substance of the Way itself,\nthe later Heaven is the application of the Way.\n\nBefore birth, the application dwells within the substance;\nafter birth, the substance contains the application within.\nIf one does not return from the application to the substance,\nthen where shall one find a basis for reliance?\n\nMoreover, those who indulge in unbridled lust\nshall find their life and body hard to preserve.\nIf private desires are not eliminated,\nthen the natural order of Heaven shall vanish.\nIf one’s pursuits are not steadfast,\nthen spirit and *qi* shall grow exhausted.\n\nTo perfect the primordial essence, *qi*, and spirit,\none must not fail to preserve the later Heaven’s essence, *qi*, and spirit.\nIn truth, these three—essence, *qi*, and spirit—\nthough named in order of priority,\nare in essence no different in kind;\nonly the presence or absence of desire divides them.\n\nThe student, if able to break free from worldly attachments,\nto perceive the emptiness of the net of karma,\nnot only shall external things be seen as not inherently mine,\nbut even the body within the body shall be regarded as a phantom form,\nnot held in great regard—\nthen refining essence shall yield the original essence,\nrefining *qi* shall yield the original *qi*,\nrefining spirit shall yield the original spirit,\nand with the primordial Dao’s great medicine,\nthe primordial Dao’s great elixir shall be formed—\nis this not a most effortless matter?\n\n(Obtain the mind and the body may be forgotten,\nobtain the spirit and the mind may be forgotten.)\n\nThe practice of cultivation, however, begins with the hands and feet—\none must first draw the curtain and seal the *Fu* (口), silently observing the one-inch, three-fen space below the navel at the **Elixir Field (丹田)**.\n\nThen, essence generates the medicine, and the **Lunar Cauldron (河车)**** begins to transport. The accumulated essence in the Elixir Field is moved throughout the body. After prolonged irrigation, the essence is fully transformed into *qi*, permeating the entire body—this is the work of refining essence into *qi*.\n\nWhen the essence has fully transformed into *qi*,\none then passes through the gates to nourish and consume,\nwarming and nurturing the great medicine—\nthis is the matter of refining *qi* into spirit.\n\nFrom this point onward,\none enters the **wall-facing (面壁)** practice,\nthe **return-to-vacuity (还虚)** Dao.\nIt begins with refining in the **lower field (下田)**,\nproceeds to cultivation in the **middle field (中田)**,\nand culminates in nourishment in the **upper field (上田)**—\nthis is what is called the **Three Fields’ return to the true primordial life (三田返复真生涯)**.\n\nThis path of cultivation and refinement,\nthose who seek the Dao must heed its principles,\nand take them as the foundation of their practice.\n\n**The measure of insight into true nature**\nFor the common person to glimpse true nature,\none must first, in a state of stillness and clarity,\nseek its faintest traces.\n\nOnly when one truly knows\nthat within the heart there lies a **true, profound, luminous, undimmed light (真湛寂光明不昧)**,\ndoes one begin to preserve it in stillness\nand examine it in motion—\nthus applying it to all things,\nnever at any moment deviating from the utmost goodness.\nWith prolonged practice and deep realization,\none naturally becomes **radiant and responsive (昭昭灵灵)**,\npresent in every moment and place without exception.\n\nWhat is this nature?\nIt is the **supreme void (太虚)**** within which all is empty and profound.\nMaster Zhang (张子) says this is what the **Dao of Great Harmony (太和)**** is.\n\nIn its essence, it manifests as the **nature of virtue (仁义礼智之性)****,\nand in its function, it reveals the **emotions of compassion, shame, propriety, and discernment (恻隐羞恶辞让是非之情)****.\n\nWhen preserved within, it is the **still, unmoving center (寂然不动之中)****,\nand when expressed outward, it is the **harmony that arises from response (感而遂通之和)****.\n\nWithout bias or contradiction,\nboth its preservation and expression\nreveal the vastness of its true nature.\n\nIn its subtle form, it is the **emergence of virtue, wisdom, intelligence, and skill (德慧智术发谋出虑)****,\nand in its manifest form, it is the **perception, speech, action, attire, food, and drink (视听言动衣服饮食)****.\n\nIn its interaction with others,\nit embodies the **degree of love and benevolence toward all (亲亲仁民之度)****,\nand in its relation to all things,\nit holds the **heart of inclusivity toward birds, beasts, grasses, and trees (鸟兽草木咸若之怀)****.\n\nIn summary, without inner or outer,\nwithout motion or stillness,\nif one knows the true nature of this nature,\nthen there is no moment or thing that can obstruct it.\n\nFor nature originally encompasses heaven and earth,\nspans antiquity and the present,\nand unifies all beings—\nthere is nothing outside of it.\nYet people are divided by private desires,\nand even within one’s own body,\nthere are distinctions like the **Hu and Yue (胡越)****—\nhow much more so between states and the world’s people,\nwho are all separated and isolated!\n\nThus, the scholar’s pursuit\nmust, before matters arise,\nbe **vast and impartial (廓然而大公)****.\nWhen matters come,\none must follow their natural course and adapt accordingly—\nneither anticipating nor resisting,\nentrusting things to their own nature,\nresponding to circumstances as they unfold.\n\nThough things change and events reach their end,\none’s own self remains unaltered.\nIt is like a **clear mirror in open space (明镜当空)****:\nthe beautiful remains beautiful,\nthe ugly remains ugly,\nwhile one’s own heart holds no trace of preference.\nThus, the heart is universal yet without attachment,\nthe emotions follow all things yet remain detached—\npossessing a **measure vast enough to encompass the world (大天下莫能载)****,\nyet refined enough to **transcend its limits (小天下莫能破)****.\n\nIf not so, those who cling to partial learning,\neither fixating on stillness for cultivation\nor chasing movement for practice,\nmay gain some fleeting insight,\nbut it is as quickly lost as attained.\nHow could they ever achieve the **unification of inner and outer, equality of self and others, harmony of motion and stillness (平物我等动静人己而一)****?\n\nThis is the **sages’ work of preserving the heart and nurturing nature (圣贤存心养性)****.\nThe scholar, in moments of neither motion nor stillness,\nmust seek the **root of both motion and stillness (有动有静之根本)****,\nand hold it firmly in mind—\nextending it to the utmost in every circumstance,\nwhether in **extreme hardship or triumph (造次颠沛)****,\nwithout ever deviating.\nThen the heart and principle merge,\nprinciple and heart blend—\nbecoming one seamless whole,\nwith no distinction between inner and outer, self and others.\n\nThough it may be said,\nits attainment is no simple matter.\n\nFor I have **broadly surveyed antiquity and the present (旷观古今)****,\nand **experienced the depths of human nature (阅历人情)****,\nand found none who do not prioritize the outer over the inner.\n\nDay after day, they scheme for their own gain,\ncoveting fame, desire, wealth, and profit,\nseeking only the comfort of their own body and family,\nand few know that **true nature is the heaviest burden (性之最重)****,\nthat nothing in the world surpasses it.\n\nEven if they know it,\ntheir understanding is but a **faint imitation (摹仿依稀)**—\nsometimes stillness is present,\nbut motion is absent;\nsometimes a thought arises,\nonly to vanish immediately.\nNone have **truly and firmly discovered the slightest trace of true reality (一点真际)**),\nas in Mencius’ words:\n*\"When dwelling in spacious halls, one practices the great Dao.\nIn gaining power, one leads the people with it;\nwithout power, one follows the great Dao alone.\nAt its utmost, in wealth or poverty, nobility or humility,\none remains uncorrupted, unmoved, and unyielding (不淫不移不屈)***.\"\nTo expand one’s heart and elevate one’s vision,\nto let the world’s judgments of good and evil, wisdom and folly\npass without ever disturbing one’s true nature—\nwhere is such a person to be found?\n\nOnly to those who follow later,\nI urge this first principle:\n**seek that which is neither real nor unreal,\nneither sound nor scent (无实亦无虚，无声亦无臭)****.\nPreserve it in stillness,\nexamine it in motion—\nrespond to all things with **emptiness to await them (虚以待之)****,\nand **harmony to adapt (顺以应之)****.\nBefore matters arise, do not preempt them;\nafter they pass, do not dwell on them.\nAs the Buddha says:\n*\"The past heart, the future heart, the present heart—\nthe three hearts are forever extinguished.\nThe relative of self, the relative of others, the relative of life and death—\nthe four relations are all empty.\"*\nThus, one nurtures the **vast, luminous, and pure body (虚明广大之体)****,\ndeeply and thoroughly,\nand applies it to all things in heaven and earth—\nall will be well.\n\nIn summary, nature has no boundaries,\nno graspable form.\nIf one seeks its true essence,\n**stillness is but an image of boundless void and undimmed clarity (空洞无边、惺惺不昧)****,\nand **motion is as Mencius described:\nwhen a person suddenly sees a child about to fall into a well,\nthey feel alarm and compassion (怵惕恻隐之心)****.\n\nYet people all have this nature,\nand nature all has moments of expression—\noften, once expressed, it is no longer seen.\n\n「Thus, the **true nature (真性)** emerges when one acts with sincerity—\nwithout calculation or hesitation—\nand all **dharma (法身)** and **sense-body (色身)** are preserved.\nYet once this nature shifts at the slightest thought,\nthe myriad **hearts of profit-loss and likes-dislikes (利害好恶之心)** arise,\nand it is then **swallowed by the turbid (汩没)** and lost.\n\nHence, Confucius said:\n*\"Once again, reflection is possible.\"*\nThe shallow scholars, however, dwell in **stillness cultivation (静中之养)**,\nand though they may glimpse the **original source (本原)**—\nboundless, undivided, and **mysterious (浑沦无际)**—\nthey still split at the moment of **holding oneself and interacting with things (持身接物)**,\nlike a **two-pronged stake (打成两橛)**,\nunable to **unify motion and stillness (合动静)** in perfect harmony.\nThis is because they fail to grasp the **measure and capacity within nature (性中之度量)**—\ntruly, it embraces the cosmos without ever exceeding its own bounds.\nIf one does not **awaken and penetrate (悟彻了明)** to this,\nfew will attain the **Dao (道)**.\n\nThis is the **heart transmission (心传)** of the **thousand sages (千圣)**,\nthe **first essential (第一要着)** for those who study.\nOne must **expand boundless compassion (一念之仁)** from a single thought,\nuntil it fills the heavens and the earth;\nand **accumulate goodness (一事之善)** from a single deed,\nuntil it spans the ages, past and future.\nThen, one **embraces all things in the world and all ages (觉天下万古)**,\nholding them all within one’s **comprehension (怀抱)**.\nIf this is truly seen,\nwhy bother with **refining cinnabar and elixir (修丹炼汞)** at all?\n\n**On the essence of establishing life (言立命之要):**\nOur **Dao (道)** speaks of **dual cultivation of nature and life (性命双修)**,\nthough it divides them into two,\nthey are in truth **one (一而已)**.\n\n**Nature (性)** is the **root of life (命之根)**,\nand **life (命)** is the **stalk of nature (性之蒂)**.\nWithout **life**, **nature** has no foundation;\nwithout **nature**, **life** has no master.\nThe two are **one in two (二者是二而一也)**.\n\nIf one **discerns the source of nature and life (明得性命之源)**,\nthen all **emotional deceits (一切情伪之私)** and **flux of perception (知觉之运)**\nare but **obstacles within life (命中之障)**.\nThus, one **cultivates the postnatal qi-breathing life (后天炁息之命)**\nand returns to the **primal prenatal essence (先天元炁之命)**—\nso as not to **fall into materialism (实有)** nor **voidism (虚无)**,\nand thereby attain the **true Dao of immortality (真仙之道)**.\n\nOtherwise, one merely **nourishes the postnatal blood-and-qi life (后天血气之命)**,\nwithout knowing the **primal prenatal void-life (先天虚无之命)**.\nEven if one achieves **eternal youth (长生不老)**,\nthey are but a **guardian of the corpse (守尸之鬼)**.\nIn the end,\nthey will **wander through life and death (生生世世流浪)** in the **ocean of love and sea of desire (爱河欲海)**\nwithout any **bound or end (穷期)**.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"The **Great Unity (太和)** of Heaven and Earth,\nall things **transform into purity (化醇)**;\n**Male and Female intermingle their essence (媾精)**,\nall things **are born (化生)**.\"*\n\nHuman beings receive the **primal essence-qi (元炁)** of Heaven and Earth\nto **form their nature (成性)**,\nand receive the **essence-qi (精炁)** of their parents\nto **establish their life (立命)**.\nThus, **opening and closing, bending and stretching (一开一阖一屈一伸)**,\nthey complete the **ten-month gestation (十月胎圆)**,\nand descend to earth as a **living body (生身)**,\ncarving out their own **domain of Heaven and Earth (独辟乾坤之界)**.\nThen there is the **division of yin and yang (阴阳之分)**—\nyet in truth, they remain **one with Heaven, Earth, and parents (仍然一般无二)**.\n\nIf **breath ceases (一息未至)**,\nthen **death is certain (必死矣)**.\nThe **qi of Heaven and Earth (天地之气)**,\nmust **intermingle and transform (絪缊)** within,\nbefore **humans and things are born in endlessness (生人生物于无穷)**.\nIf one merely speaks of **ascending and descending (升上降下)**,\nthen the **qi of Heaven and Earth**, though **intermingling (交)**,\nstill remains **divided into two (分而为二)**.\n\nThe **qi of the human body (人身之炁)**,\nmust also **intermingle and transform (絪缊)** within,\nbefore **endlessly giving birth to males and females (生男育女于不息)**.\nIf one only speaks of **inhaling and exhaling (呼出吸入)**,\nthen the **human qi**, though **intermingling (交)**,\nstill **cannot unify into one (不能合而为一)**—\nhow then could one **achieve an indestructible body (万古不坏之身)**?\n\nScholars must **recover the breath (呼吸之息)**\nto **restore the primal essence-qi (太和之元炁)**.\nThe **Dao (道)** is this:\n**Do not shake your essence (无摇尔精)**,\n**do not strain your form (无劳尔形)**,\n**do not let your thoughts labor ceaselessly (无俾尔思虑营营)**—\nthen one may **achieve eternal life (长生)**.\n\nAgain it is said:\n*\"When the **heart is unmoved (心不动)**,\nit is called **refining essence (炼精)**—\n**refining essence** brings forth **tiger’s roar and wind’s birth (虎啸风生)**;\n**When the body is unmoved (身不动)**,\nit is called **refining qi (炼炁)**—\n**refining qi** evokes **dragon’s chant and clouds ascending (龙吟云起)**;\n**When the mind is unmoved (念不动)**,\nit is called **refining spirit (炼神)**—\n**refining spirit** manifests as **primal essence flowing (元精溶溶)**,\n**primal qi vast (元气浩浩)**,\nand **primal spirit leaping (元神跃跃)**.\n\nIf this is not yet achieved,\none must first **reduce desires to preserve essence (寡欲以养精)**,\n**speak little to preserve qi (寡言以养炁)**,\nand **think little to preserve spirit (少思以养神)**.\nWhen **returning essence to nourish the brain (还精补脑)** is practiced,\nthen **essence will not leak (精自不泄)**;\n**heart and breath interdependent (心息相依)**,\n**forgetting speech and holding the middle (忘言守中)**,\nthen **qi will not scatter (炁自不散)**;\n**form and spirit both wondrous (形神俱妙)**,\n**uniting with the Dao in truth (与道合真)**,\nthen **spirit will not be disturbed (神自不扰)**.\n\nIf one does not **silently merge the postnatal essence, qi, and spirit (后天之精炁神)**\nwith the **primal prenatal essence-qi (先天之元炁)**,\nthen **few will avoid falling into one-sidedness (未有不堕于一偏之学者)**.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Postnatal breathing stirs the **micro-wind (微风)**,\nwhich awakens the **true person’s creative function (真人造化功)**.\"*\nHow profound their words!\n\nAgain they said:\n*\"When the **myriad sounds (万籁)** first rise with the wind,\nand the **thousand mountains (千山)** see the moon newly round—\n**urgently issue the sovereign’s command (行政令)**,\nand the **circulation of the cosmos (周天)** will move.\"*\nScholars must **watch the middle’s opportunity (守中之候)**\nto **nourish the elixir field (调养乎丹田)**.\nWith time,\n**essence generates medicine (精生药产)**,\n**spirit is complete and qi is full (神完炁足)**,\nand thus one **practices the eight hundred draws-and-adds (八百抽添之数)**,\nand the **three hundred sixty hexagrams (三百六十之爻)**—\n**advancing yang fire (进阳火)**,\n**retreating yin symbols (退阴符)**—\nusing the **method of coiling in the elixir field (卯酉沐浴之法)**,\nthen **the cinnabar and lead phenomena (丹铅现象)** appear,\nwith **six kinds of verification (六种效验)**.\nAfterward, one **performs the Five Dragons Bear the Sage (五龙捧圣)**\nand **Seven Days Pass the Barrier (七日过关)**—\nthen one may **return the elixir of jade-fluid (还玉液之丹)**\nand achieve the **indestructible body (不死之身)**.\n\nThen, with the **refinement of the void (炼虚一着)**,\none arrives at **stillness without motion (如如不动)**,\n**clarity without dimming (惺惺长明)**—\n**completely without trace of action (浑无半点作为之迹)**,\nyet **nothing in all things can fail to act (究无一物一事之不能作为)**.\nAt this stage,\none has truly **fulfilled the great man’s accomplishment (大丈夫功成道立之候)**.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"This time of great death is when one truly lives (大死今方活).\"*\nAgain they said:\n*\"If one wishes to avoid death,\nthey must first die to humanity (若要人不死，除非死过人).\"*\nFrom this, one sees:\n**It is only when the ordinary heart dies (凡心死)**\nand the **Dao-heart arises (道心生)**,\nthat the **ordinary mechanism (凡机)** ceases\nand the **true mechanism (真机)** is revealed.\n\nI observe those who **pursue the Dao in this world (世之学道者)**—\nmany **refine the sense-body without refining the dharma-body (炼色身不炼法身)**,\nand though they achieve **eternal life (长生)**,\nit is but **a fleeting matter (偶然之事)**;\nothers **refine the dharma-body without attending to the sense-body (炼法身而不讲色身)**—\nyet **how can they know (讵知)** that\nbefore **parents gave birth (父母未生)**,\nthis **qi dwelled in the void (此气在于空中)**,\n**without form or color to imitate (杳无形色可拟)**?\nAnd after **Heaven and Earth were born (天地既生)**,\nthis **qi settled within the body (此炁在于身中)**,\n**with clear traces to rely upon (实有端倪可据)**.\nMoreover,\nonce one has **obtained a human body (得人身)**,\nthen the **primal essence-qi is fully immersed in material-qi (浑然元气陷于气质之中)**.\nIf one does not first **preserve the ordinary body (保凡身)**,\nthen from where will the **primal prenatal essence-qi (先天元炁)** be seen?\nThese two approaches **have yet to glimpse the complete cultivation of the great use (全体大用之学)**.»\n\n「Some may say that those who practice with a **pure and tranquil Dao-heart (道心)** refine **nature (性)** but not **life (命)**—\nwhen their cultivation succeeds,\n**nature returns to its primal state (性复先天)**,\nand **life merges back into the Great Ultimate (命亦归夫太极)**.\nThose who solely refine **life** alone,\nlikely cannot achieve such **divine efficacy (神效)**.\nStill,\nthis also depends on the **constitution of each individual (各人之体)**.\nIf the **sense-body (色身)** is unblemished and whole,\nand **essence-qi (精)**, **primal qi (炁)**, and **spirit (神)** are all complete,\nthen what need is there for **life-refining techniques (命功)**?\n\nIf the **sense-body** is weak,\nand the **physical constitution (体质)** is deficient,\none must first apply **life-refining techniques**—\neven if one cultivates to the utmost,\nit will merely yield **a thread of yin-qi (一点阴炁)**,\nwith **no vitality of yang (无有阳光)**.\n\nThus,\nthe ancients who refined **nature (性)** but not **life (命)**,\nthough they could **adjust the spirit (神)** and **exit the shell (出壳)**,\n**roaming the four directions (游行四表)**,\nultimately all their achievements were **vague and fleeting (恍惚离奇)**,\n**empty and unreal (一切虚而不实)**—\nthis was because they **failed to ground themselves (未能踏实)**,\nand thus **could not ascend to the realm of transcendence (无以为凌虚之境)**.\n\nLater cultivators,\nunderstanding the **progression from coarse to refined (粗以及精)**,\nand that **one must return to the void (返无)****,\navoided **one-sided, solitary cultivation (孤修寂炼)**.\n\n**Carefully observe the principle of gathering and refining (守中采取之义)**.\nThe **Dao of refining elixir (炼丹之道)**,\nfor those whose **bodies are naturally robust (身体素壮)** and **spirit undamaged (精神无亏)**,\nrequires **no need for gathering-centering practices (守中一切工夫)**.\nBut for those in their **forties or fifties (四十五十)**,\nwho have long **responded to worldly affairs (应酬世故)**,\nand have already **borne many sons and raised many daughters (生男育女已多)**,\nthese **refining techniques (工)** are indispensable.\nIf one’s **body is broken and incomplete (破体不完)**,\nand their **spirit is enfeebled (精神尪羸)**,\nwithout applying **gathering-centering techniques (守中工夫)**,\nthen **a depleted and flawed vessel (破漏之躯)**,\nwith **scattered spirit and qi (神炁消散)**,\nwill struggle to **produce the elixir of life (精生药产)**—\nthis is difficult indeed.\n\nThe method lies in:\n**closing the eyes and sealing the nostrils (以眼默鼻)**,\n**directing the nostrils toward the elixir field (丹田) (以鼻对丹田)**,\nand **retrieving the spirit within the primal orifice (祖窍)**.\nWith time,\n**the primal qi (真炁)** becomes abundant and vigorous (冲足)**,\nwithin, the **heart-spirit opens freely (心神开泰)**,\nwithout, the **breathing is serene and expansive (气息悠扬)**.\n\nWhether **at night in repose (夜卧)** or **by day in slumber (昼眠)**,\nat any time or place,\nif suddenly **the yang-essence rises in full (阳物大举)**,\nthis is the **clear sign of life-refining success (精生药产之明效)**.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* states:\n*\"Before knowing the union of female and male,\nthere was the **Great Refinement (朘作)**—\nthe **peak of essence (精之大至)**.\"*\n\nIn summary,\n**the source of water (精)** must remain **untainted by desire (不着欲念)**,\nfor even **the faintest touch of desire (稍触欲念)** makes it **impure (浊)**.\nCultivators must carefully examine:\nwhen **the yang-essence rises (阳物之勃举)**,\nwhether it is **free from calculation or desire (无欲念计较)**,\nand then apply the **method of retrieval (收摄之法)**,\n**lifting it into the elixir field’s earthen furnace (丹田土釜)**,\n**gazing upward with the eyes (以目上视)**,\nand **raising it with the mind (以意上提)**.\nGradually **employing intent (稍稍用意)**,\nover time,\n**the external yang-essence contracts fully (外阳缩尽)**,\nand **the external scrotum (囊) is drawn inward completely (外囊收尽)**.\nThen,\n**warm the furnace gently (温温铅鼎)**—\nthis must be done **with intent yet without intent (有意无意)**,\n**slightly observing (微微观照)** alone.\n\nHowever,\nthis is best practiced **during deep sleep at night (夜间酣眠之时)**—\n**do not greedily cling to sleep (切不可贪眠不起)**,\nlest **the yang-essence stir (阳动)** and **lustful thoughts arise (淫心起)**,\nleading to **lustful deeds (淫事)** that **damage the true essence (真精)**—\nthis is indeed perilous.\n\nSome may ask:\n*\"Does not the human body already possess **true essence (真精)**?\nThis **coarse essence (粗精)** is the **unending source of life (生生不已)**—\nwhy must one **fixate on retaining the external essence (外精之固)**?\"*\n\nYet **how can they know (讵知)**?\n**Essence has no true without the coarse (精无真凡)**—\none must first **rely on this coarse essence (凡精)**,\nand then **true essence has a foundation (真精有赖)**.\nIf there is **no coarse essence (苟无凡精)**,\nthen **the breath-qi grows faint (炁息奄奄)**,\nand **one cannot even endure from morning to evening (朝不虑夕)**—\n**how much less can they respond to worldly affairs (而况应酬事故)**?\n**And what of attaining immortality or sainthood (而况成仙证圣)**?\nThis is **the ignorance of essence’s principle (此不知精之义也)**.\n\nCultivators must first,\n**when seated in meditation (打坐时)**,\n**concentrate the spirit and regulate the breath (凝神调息)**—\n**regulating the breath to concentrate the spirit (调息凝神)**,\nand **sweeping away all thoughts of family, love, and worldly entanglements (为身为家恩爱牵缠念头)****.\nThey must **firmly establish their resolve (立起志向)**,\nand **settle their spirit (整顿精神)**:\n*\"Now that my years are advanced (年华已老)**,\nwhat kind of person do I truly wish to become (到底想为个甚么人)?\nWhat must I accomplish today (今日应做些甚么事)?\nIn this **waning sunset of life (桑榆晚景)**,\nI still **do not know how to urgently refine and cultivate (猛修急炼)**,\n**quickly turning back (快快回头)**—\nI fear **that time will pass and not return (日月逝矣，岁不我与)**,\nand **that I will only regret it at the end (到头追悔无及)**—\n**alas, how lamentable (嗟何如哉)!\"*\n\nIf one can **thus exhort and encourage oneself (自劝自勉)**,\n**and allow the spirit-light to illuminate the elixir field (以离火下照于丹田)**—\nwhether **counting breaths (数息)** or **not (不数息)**—\n**the key is to have no lingering thoughts (百无存想)**,\nand **to suppress all worldly concerns (万虑潜消)**,\n**following the natural rhythm of inhalation and exhalation (顺呼吸之来往)**,\n**listening to the breath-qi’s spontaneous flow (听炁息之自然)**—\n**neither too long nor too short (不可过长过短)**,\nlest **the elixir fail to manifest (致令大药不生)**—\nfor **too long brings cold and dampness (过长则有水寒之患)**,\nand **too short invites heat and agitation (过短则有火热之弊)**.\nBoth extremes **become burdens to the body (二者皆为身之累)**.\n\nThe method consists solely of:\n**allowing the spirit-light to illuminate downward (神光下照)**,\nthen **the primal yang-essence’s single point of buoyant gold (先天一点乾金)**,\nafter **the union of Heaven and Earth (乾坤交媾)**,\n**sinks into the water’s depths (沈于水底)** and **lies dormant (伏而不起)**.\nWhen **the spirit-fire presses (神火一逼)**,\nthen **the water steams and the gold boils (水蒸金沸)**,\n**naturally emerging within the primal orifice (祖窍)**.\n\nIf one **does not rise (不起)** but instead **remains seated cross-legged (盘坐)**,\nwhen **the yang-essence rises (阳物一举)**,\n**the active child (活子)** appears—\nin an instant,\n**lustful desire will arise (必生淫欲)**;\neven if no **lustful deed (淫事)** occurs,\n**the essence will stray from its proper place (出乎其位)**,\nand **transform into postnatal essence (化成后天之精)**—\n**its momentum cannot be reversed (其势不可挽回)**.\n\nIf one **does not yet know (未知)**,\nand **the yang-essence has not yet risen (阳未举)**,\nwhile **recklessly applying the retrieval-lifting method (妄用升提之法)**,\nthen **the elixir is faint and uncollectable (药微无可采)**;\nif **the yang-essence has already risen (阳已举)**,\nwhile **not applying the retrieval-lifting method (不用提掇之法)**,\nthen **the elixir grows stale and unusable (药老而不可用)**.\n\nThus,\nwhen first **beginning cultivation (下手之初)**,\none must **maintain a clear and alert mind (明觉之心)**,\nand **unyielding resolve (刚果之力)**—\n**awaken at the slightest stir (一觉便起)**,\n**and return to seated meditation immediately (一起即坐)**.\n**Employ a true intent to subtly lift and retrieve (用一点真意微微升提)**,\n**ensuring the external yang-essence and external scrotum are fully contracted (务要外阳外囊收缩尽净)**—\nonly then **can true qi be generated (庶可以生真炁)**.\n\nIf **yin and yang do not unite (阴阳不交)**,\nyet **the yang-essence rises (有阳物勃举之候)**,\nthere must be **impure desires (欲念)** that **mingle within (以杂乎其中)**—\nsuch **unclean sources (不清之水源)**,\nthough **not suitable for retrieval (虽不可用采取)**,\nmust **nevertheless be stilled (不可听其摇动而不已)**,\nfor they **drain the essence of one’s body (有耗吾一身之精)**.\nHere, one must **apply the technique of preserving principle and suppressing desire (存理遏欲之功)****,\n**to seal and contain it (以窒塞之)**—\n**do not mistakenly believe this to be the true yang-essence arising (切不可认为真阳发生)**,\nfor **recklessly lifting and retrieving (妄用升举)** will **bring harm to one’s body (患于一身)**.\n\nMoreover,\none must **know that the true yang-essence arises naturally (真阳之生)**—\n**it comes without effort (自然而至)**,\n**not through calculation (不由计较)**.\nThus,\n**drawing it back to the furnace (引之归炉)** and **to the cauldron (就鼎)**,\n**one need not exert the slightest force (又(疑作不)须片刻工夫)**—\n**the essence naturally returns to the cauldron (自然精归于鼎)**,\n**the body stands firm as a wall (身如壁立)**,\nand **the mind is still as cold ashes (意如寒灰)**.\nThere is **a hazy, indistinct state (恍恍惚惚)**,\nand **a boundless, unfathomable condition (杳杳冥冥)**.**»**\n\n「This practice of refining must be done one return at a time. The ancient immortals say: *\"For every bit of essence (精) accumulated, one gains a bit of power (力); for every tenth portion of qi (炁) refined, one gains tenfold power.\"* This surpasses the ordinary benefits of stillness (静照), yet people fail to awaken resolutely and persist in their practice, instead drifting past it—how regrettable!\n\nWorse still, if one does not practice gathering and containing (收摄), the vital forces will inevitably dissipate and accumulate, transforming into **post-heaven essence (后天之精)**. This is the foundational step of **cultivating the center (守中)**, the most urgent task for those who study the Dao/Way.\n\nIf one speaks of the Dao/Way from beginning to end, it is all about **cultivating the center (守中)**—\nat first, **refining essence (精) and transforming qi (炁) within the tangible center (有形之中)**,\nand in the end, **refining the subtle and uniting with the Dao/Way (炼虚合道) within the formless center (无形之中)**.\n\nAt this stage, one feels a **soft, supple comfort (苏软如绵)**, exquisite and boundless—\nlike the gentle warmth of spring thawing one’s sleep,\nor the ease of a body newly washed and anointed,\nor the **effortless buoyancy of a bird taking flight (如鸟之冲举)**,\nor the **free grace of a fish swimming (似鱼之游翔)**.\nAll things under heaven, without exception,\nfind **harmony in one’s heart (惬于其心)** and **pleasure in one’s mind (称于其意)**,\ntruly embodying the **vast sentiment of no heaven, no earth, no self, no others (何天何地无人无我之慨)**.\nOne realizes that within one’s body,\n**there is no place that is not the center (无处非中)**,\n**no time that is not the center (无时非中)**—\nthis is the mark of **great completion in the Golden Elixir (金丹大成之候)**.\n\nStudents must not dismiss **cultivating the center (守中)** as a crude practice,\nnor should they regard **counting the breath (数息)** as a difficult task.\nThe key is that the **heart is unattached (心无所系)** and the **spirit is unsupported (神无所依)**,\nforcing one into a **wandering, unrestrained state (泛泛然)** like a wild bird with no home.\nThus, **counting the breath (数息)** is the initial practice for beginners (增),\nyet unlike the **Buddhist counting of Muni (数牟尼)**, it is meant to **anchor the mind (有所归宿)**.\n\nThe **Buddhist counting of Muni (释氏之数牟尼)**, though its spirit is confined externally (非也，此局外之言),\nis still bound by breath-counting—\nbut even this does not escape the **cinnabar field (丹田)**.\nHow much more so when one **directs the gaze downward (以目光下照)** and **anchors the mind below (以心意下引)**,\n**taming the wild monkey and fierce horse (拴锁狂猿烈马)**,\nso that the **qi and breath return to the earthen cauldron (炁息归于土釜)**,\nand the **qi-essence does not arise through this method (炁液不由此而生)**?\n\nObserve how **metallic minerals (金石)**,\nwhen exhaled upon with breath,\n**condense into water droplets (必生成水珠)**.\nYet who has **reversed the breath-qi into the void (将炁息返于虚无一窍之中)** without generating essence (精) and producing qi (炁)?\nThus the ancients say:\n*\"When the breath-qi is **oily and flowing (油然潝然)**,\none naturally permits **essence to generate and medicine to form (精生药产)**,\ncirculating **throughout the body (流通于一身之中)**—\nthis proves the **truth of refining essence and transforming qi (炼精化炁)** is not empty.\"*\n\n**The Method of Circulating the Small Heavenly Cycle (运小周天之法)**\nPreviously mentioned was the **practice of cultivating the center and nurturing warmth (守中温养)**,**\na **fundamental technique for dull roots and leaky bodies (钝根漏体)**.\nIf one can **preserve the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit (精气神三宝) without loss**,\nlike a **child’s untainted body (童体)**,\nthen one need not rely on **cultivating the center (守中)**.\nInstead, one may directly begin **moving the River Chariot (河车搬运)**.\n\nYet I observe that most people,\nin their youth, **still burn with worldly passions (尘情正炽)** and **find love hard to sever (恩爱难割)**,\nthough their **bodies may remain unharmed (体无亏欠)**,\ntheir **nature struggles to remain pure (性又难纯)**.\nBy middle or later years,\nthey are worn down by worldly affairs (尘事),\nonly then realizing that **even in wealth and honor (纵然荣华富贵)**, one cannot **fully enjoy blessings (享福不了)**—\nall is but a **field of suffering (苦恼之场)**.\nHow much more so when faced with **poverty, humiliation, worries, and grievances (贫贱忧戚)**, all manner of **displeasing circumstances (拂意之事)** that cannot be avoided?\nThus, they turn their **single heart toward the Dao/Way (一心向道)**,\npursuing **pureness of primordial nature (独修先天之性)**—\nbut alas, **life is already near its end (命已垂危)**, and **where can nature now depend (性将何依)**?\n\nThe Dao/Way speaks of **cultivating the center (守中)** as a **stage (一候)**,\nteaching one to **concentrate the spirit at the breath-qi orifice (神凝炁穴)**,\n**settle the breath within the middle (息住规中)**,\n**uniting the Three Families (会三姓于一堂)** and **harmonizing the Five Phases into One (合五行而归一)**.\nIt seeks to **reclaim the five senses (外之五根)** and the **five spirits (内之五灵)**—\npreviously **constrained by breath-qi (气质)** and **obscured by desires (物欲)**,\nnow **gathered inward (敛之于内)** to **fill the spirit (满副精神)**,\n**purely residing in the ancestral orifice (纯纯乎祖窍之中)**.\nWith time, **true yang-essence (真阳)** will **naturally emerge (发现)**,\nallowing one to **apply the River Chariot technique (运用河车之功)** and **practice the law of advance and retreat (行进退之法)**.\n\nIf one only **stirs the external yang (外阳勃举)**,\nthis is but **the faint movement of minor yang (微阳初动)**—\nnot the **true yang (真阳)**.\nOne may **draw it upward with the gaze (目引之而上升)** and **guide it back to the pot (意引之而归壶)**,\nbut one must **not hastily reverse the River Chariot (遽转河车)**.\nIf one does so while **the body’s bones and meridians are still unfilled with essence and blood (一身骨节之间精血未充)**,\nthen **forcing the mind to move the qi (以意运气)** will **inevitably scorch one’s essence and blood (烧灼一身精血)**,\ncausing **great harm (为害不小)**.\n\nMoreover,\nif the **mind is not yet settled (心意未静)**,\nthere will **inevitably be stagnation (不能不有凝滞)**.\nShould **blood and qi be obstructed by chaotic intrusions (为杂妄所窒)**,\nthen **back diseases (背疽)** arise in the back,\n**brain abscesses (脑痈)** in the head,\n**lung and intestinal abscesses (肺痈肠痈)** along with **single-sided abdominal distension (单腹鼓胀)** in the lungs,\nand in the **kidneys (肾)**, either **leakage of semen and blood (滑遗精血)**,\nor **venereal sores and kidney abscesses (杨梅肾痈)**—\nthe symptoms vary, but the **root is the same: fire without water (无水行火)**.\nThe **water grows increasingly parched (水愈灼枯)** while the **fire rages ever fiercer (火愈炎烈)**,\nand its **force may become unstoppable (有不能遏者)**—\nthis is the **calamity of perverse fire consuming the body (邪火焚身之患)**,\na **warning for students (学者所当戒)**.\n\nEven those with **pure nature and settled mind (性纯心定)** may not reach such extremes,\nbut without **darkened vision and ringing ears (目暗耳鸣)**,\nthey will **suffer mental agitation and restless thoughts (心烦意乱)**.\nOne must **never recklessly disturb (切不可轻意乱动)**.\n\nNecessarily,\nwhen **warmth-qi (温暖之气)** arises in the **cinnabar field (丹田)**,\n**rising straight and forceful (冲冲直上)** from the navel to the **eyebrows and eyes (眉目之间)**,\na **path of white light will radiate (一路皆有白光晃发)**.\nIf this occurs **once, twice, or thrice (如此至再至三)**,\nand one **verifies its authenticity (审其属实)**,\nknowing that **this rising qi is not empty yang (绝非虚阳显露)**,\nthen one may **proceed with the River Chariot technique (行河车搬运之法)**.\nMost importantly,\none must **understand that the qi of true yang (真阳之炁)**,\nbeing **most potent and robust (至刚至壮)**,\nwill **inevitably burst from the cinnabar field (丹田炁突)**,\nonly then **opening the pass and unfolding the orifice (开关展窍)**—\n**no need to expend force in drawing it up and down (不须多用气力引之上升而下降)**.\n\nMoreover,\nthe **body’s blood and qi (人身血气)**,\nby their **very nature (本来)**, **flow harmoniously without obstruction (运行毫不相违)**.\nYet from the moment **awareness begins (自知识甫开)**,\n**private desires (私欲)** **interfere (介之)**,\n**thoughts and deliberations (思虑)** **disrupt (挠之)**,\nso that they **can no longer follow the natural movement of heaven (顺天之自然)**,\n**circulating within the body (运行于一身之内)**.\nThus, one must **first gather and contain (收敛)** the **body and mind (身心)**,\n**order and solemnize (整齐严肃)**,\n**sheltering the five senses and hundred bones (尽藏于丹田之中)** within the **cinnabar field (丹田)**.\nWhen the **mind is pure (心纯)** and the **qi is still (气静)** while the **essence is sufficient (精足)**,\n**the body will naturally be suffused (周身灌溉)**,\nand its **circulation will be endless (运用不穷)**.»\n\n「If one does not **intentionally gather (以意摄)** the **qi** to ascend and descend,\nthen one must fear that the **mind (心)** will be impure,\nand the **qi (炁)** will be disordered.\nEither one will suffer from **excessive length (过长之病)**,\nor one will face the **woes of deficiency (过短之忧)**,\nand the **true essence (真精)** will fail to return to the **central yellow (中黄)**—the proper position—\nhow then could the **physical form (色身)** endure for long?\n\nAt this time,\none need only **gently guide (微微引)** it,\nfollowing the **ordinary rhythm of breathing (呼吸之常)**,\naligning perfectly with the **measure of heaven and earth (天地合度)**.\nThen the **embryonic qi (絪缊之气)**—\nthe **qi of life (胎气)**—\nwill naturally **nourish the embryo (养胎)** and **congeal the elixir (结丹)**,\nthus forming the **body of immortality (不老之身)**.\n\nThe **Dao (吾道)** speaks of **reversing aging and restoring youth (返老还童)**,\nnot that it was **never present (本来所无)** in the first place,\nbut because one **harnesses what exists (因其所有)** to benefit the **Way (利道)**,\nreturning to the **beginning of infancy (孩提之初)**.\n\nYet one must not fail to understand the **methods of:\n- advancing the **true yang qi (真阳之炁)** at the **Child hour (子进)**,\n- withdrawing the **yin symbol (阴符)** at the **Noon hour (午退)**,\n- bathing in the **Dragon and Tiger hours (卯酉沐浴)**».\nOnce one **self-examines (自审)** and **discovers the true yang qi (真阳发现)**,\nif it is indeed **untainted (无他)**,\nthen one must **slightly regulate (规中少着意思)**—\ntaking this **true yang qi (真阳之炁)**,\nstealing it past the **inner kidney (内肾)**,\nacross the **lower bridge (下桥)**,\nthrough the **tail pass (尾闾)**,\nbetween the **double spinal gates (夹脊双关)**,\nup to the **jade pillow (玉枕)**,\nand reaching the **muddy pellet palace (泥丸之宫)**.\nThen **leading it down to the third eye (印堂)**,\nand further to the **double pavilion (重楼)** and **crimson palace (绛宫)**,\none finally **sends it back to the cinnabar field (丹田)**,\n**warming and nourishing (温之养之)**,\n**simmering and refining (烹之炼之)** it—\nthen the **elixir (丹)** will naturally **congeal (结)**.\n\nAlthough,\nthe **circulation of the microcosmic orbit (周天之数)** is **not aimlessly without measure (漫无度哉)**,\nnor is it **rigidly fixed to a single measure (死死执着乎度哉)**.\n\nIn summary,\nwithin a **single day (一日之间)**,\nor a **year (一年之内)**,\nthere are always **twelve earthly branches (十二时辰)**.\nFrom **Child (子)** to **Perch (巳)**—the **six yang hours (六阳时)**—\none must **count up to thirty-six degrees (三十六度)** in each hour,\ntotaling **two hundred sixteen counts (二百十六数)**.\nFrom **Noon (午)** to **Rooster (亥)**—the **six yin hours (六阴时)**—\none must also **count up to twenty-four degrees (二十四度)** in each hour,\nyet the **Dragon and Tiger hours (卯酉二时)** are the **times of bathing (沐浴之时)**,\nso one **excludes these two hours (除却二时)** from counting,\nstill obtaining the **three hundred counts of the microcosmic orbit (周天三百之数)**—\nthus it is called the **small microcosmic orbit (小周天河车)**.\n\nAt the outset,\none may **circulate once or twice (一二周天)** in a night,\nbut with time,\none may **circulate three to five times (三五周天)**,\nand even longer,\none may **circulate fifteen times (十五周天)**—\nthis is when the **great medicine is about to be born (大药将产)**,\nand the **small microcosmic orbit is about to cease (河车将停)**.\n\nYet one must **verify six signs (六种效验)** before halting:\n- **golden radiance in the eyes (目有金光)**,\n- **nasal twitching (鼻有抽搐)**,\n- **wind in the ears (耳有风生)**,\n- **the cry of a vulture behind the head (脑后有鹫鸣)**,\n- **the brilliance of a fire pearl in the cinnabar field (丹田有火珠之耀)**,\n- **thunderous vibrations in the abdomen (腹中有震雷之声)**.\nOnly then may one **stop the fire (停火)**,\nuntil the **seven-day practice of the great microcosmic orbit (七日过关大周天之工夫)** is complete.\n\nThis is what is called\nthe **union of Dragon and Tiger (龙虎交)**,\nand the **emergence of the yellow sprout (黄芽产)**—\nthe **affairs of the small microcosmic orbit (小河车)**—\nand also what is termed\nthe **hundred-day foundation-building (百日筑基)**,\nto **forge the elixir of immortality (成不老之丹)**.\n\nYet if one truly **refines the mind’s nature (心性工夫)**,\nand has **previously cultivated (从前养)** it to **purity (纯粹)**,\nlike **Cao’s return to yang (曹还阳)**,\nwhere the **great elixir forms (大丹成)** in **less than fifty days (不五旬)**,\nthen the term **hundred days (百日)** is merely a **general approximation (举其大概)**—\nso too is the **speaking of the small microcosmic orbit (云河车)**.\nThe **wise practitioner (智者)** will **perceive its true meaning (神而明之)**,\nand **act in accordance with the natural measure (行乎自然之度)**.\n\nFor the **common person (常人)**,\none must **strictly adhere to the counts (拘其度数)**,\nlest they **act recklessly from ignorance (无知妄作)**,\nfor even then they **cannot forge the elixir (不能成丹)**.\n\nThus,\nwhen **advancing the yang fire (进阳火)**,\nthe **yang qi is still tender (其阳尚嫩)**,\nbut by the time of the **Tiger hour (寅位)**,\nit has already reached **one hundred counts (一百之数)**,\nand the **yang qi will surge (阳气勃勃)** beyond restraint.\nAt this point,\none must **employ the method of intentional yet unintentional guidance (以有意无意行之)**—\nthis is the **Dragon hour bathing (卯沐浴)**.\nWhen **withdrawing the symbol (退符)**,\none must **guide the yang qi back to the earthen cauldron (土釜)**,\nusing **pure intention (纯用真意)**.\nAt the **interval between noon and midday (午前)**,\nor **midday and afternoon (午后)**,\nthe **yang qi is not yet at its peak (其阳不盛)**,\nbut by the time of the **Rooster hour (酉位)**,\nthe **yang qi must return fully (阳之归还必极)**—\nand one must **entirely trust in nature’s movement (纯任自然)** to **circulate it (以运之)**.\nThis is the **Dragon and Tiger hour bathing (卯酉沐浴)**.\n\nMoreover,\n**fire is born at the Tiger hour (火生于寅)**,\nand one must know of the **fire tomb at the Dog hour (火墓戌)**—\nhere lies **subtle meaning (微意)**,\nwhich I **dare not fully disclose (不敢一口尽泄)**.\nThe **determined cultivator (有志修士)** should **fathom its true essence (揣度其真谛)**.\n\nThe **practice of the small microcosmic orbit (小河车之功)** is as such,\nyet it is also the **stage of refining essence into qi (炼精化炁)**.\nHow then does one **know that the essence has fully transformed into qi (精尽化气)**?\nWhen the **external yang qi is fully withdrawn (外阳收缩尽净)**,\nand the **orifices of essence are known to be sealed (精窍知其已闭)**—\nif even **a single drop of essence remains unrefined (有一分精未化)**,\nthen the **yang qi will not withdraw (其阳不收)**,\nand the **orifices will not close (其窍不闭)**;\nthe **qi will not coalesce (炁不团聚)**,\nand it **cannot undergo transformation (不能变化)** to produce the **six divine signs (六种之神效)**.\nThis is the **clear oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction (口传心授)**—\nthe **student (学者)** should **follow this practice (照此行持)**,\n**neither forgetting nor forcing (勿忘勿助)**—\nthen the **Way (斯道)** will be attained.\n\n**The practice of the great microcosmic orbit (行大周天之功)**—\nI have previously spoken of **refining essence into qi (炼精化炁)**,\nand the **practice of the small microcosmic orbit (行小周天之功)**,\nwhich is **indeed rooted in what the body possesses (本人身之所有者)**.\nOne **returns to refine (返而炼)** it within the **body (于一身)**,\nto **restore the original elemental qi (还夫本来之元炁)**.\n\nFor **the body’s qi (人之炁)** is **originally complete (原自具足)**,\nbut from the moment **awareness begins (知识甫开)**,\nthe **qi is obscured (气质锢蔽)**,\nand **worldly desires (物欲)** **assail it (交攻)**,\ncausing the **qi to scatter and disorder (散乱)**,\nso that it **cannot return to its root (归根)** nor **reclaim its vital essence (复命)**.\nOnly by **borrowing the undifferentiated qi (浑然之炁)**,\n**gathering and containing the body’s own qi (收摄吾身之炁)**,\ncan one **make it purely conform to its boundaries (纯就范围)**,\nand **merge it into a single whole (合而为一)**.\nWith time,\n**essence generates qi (精生炁)**,\nand **qi refines essence (炁化精)**—\nsufficient to **preserve the physical form (保形色之躯)**.\n\nThis is what the **alchemical classics (丹经)** say of\n**\"seeking the mysterious in the Water Palace (水府求玄)**,\n**and obtaining the elixir in two stages (二候得丹)**\".\n\nAt this time of **hundred-day foundation-building (百日筑基)**,\n**refining essence into qi (炼精化炁)**,\nand **circulating the small microcosmic orbit (运用河车)**,\none must **attach to nothing externally (外无所着)**,\nnor **be tainted by anything internally (内无所染)**.\nThe **body should be like withered wood (身如槁木)**,\nand the **mind like cold ashes (意若寒灰)**.\nAll **ten thousand entanglements (万缘)** must **cease (顿息)**,\nand the **five aggregates (五蕴)** all **be empty (皆空)**.\nThus,\nwith **such diligent cultivation (殷勤修炼)**,\n**not deviating by a single hair (不差毫发)**,\n**water and fire balanced (水火停匀)**,\n**lead and mercury harmonized (铅汞配合)**,\n**Dragon and Tiger no longer contending (龙虎不相争斗)**,\nand **tortoise and serpent united (龟蛇合为一体)**—\nat first,\nthe **true lead (真铅)** reveals its **form (现象)**,\nlike the **moon emerging in the seventh celestial stem (庚方)**,\nwith only a **thin line of faint light (一线微明)**.\nThe **qi is still soft (其炁尚柔)**,\nand the **substance is tender (其质尚嫩)**.\nAt this moment,\nwhen the **true yang qi is discovered (铅阳发现)**,\none must **practice the methods of advancing and withdrawing the symbolic fire (运行进退符火之功)**.\nAs the **days of accumulated essence and refined qi (积精累炁)** grow long,\nand the **foundation-building and self-refining (筑基炼己)** are completed,\nthe **qi becomes warm and flowing (炁油然潝然)**,\n**fusing like ice melting (融融似冰泮)**,\n**vast like the tide rising (浩浩似潮生)**,\n**surging and overflowing (滔滔汩汩)**—\n**directly circulating throughout the body (直周流乎)**.\n\nWithin the single body,\nthere are forces that cannot be restrained—\nthus one applies the **refinement of qi and transformation of spirit (炼炁化神)**,\npracticing the **seven-and-a-half-day celestial method of passing trials and ingesting (七日半过关服食之天机)**,\nemploying the **authentic technique of the Five Dragons bearing the Sacred (五龙捧圣之真诀)**.\nAt this moment, when the spirit perceives,\nthe wondrous application manifests—\nthe **yang light is activated (阳光发动)**,\nthe **great medicine takes form (大药呈形)**.\nThen, with effortless lifting,\nand silent movement,\none subtly directs the mind to move the qi,\noperating the **pivotal mechanism of transformation (造化之枢机)**—\nnaturally, the **water reveals itself, the fire transforms into one qi (水见火化为一炁)**.\n\nThe **technique states**:\n*\"Follow the law to chase the soul and gather the spirit (依法度追魂摄魄),\nrely on the artisan’s hand to grasp mist and seize clouds (凭匠手捉雾拿云).\"*\nStrive to make the **spirit surge through the qi (神冲气)**,\nthe **qi surge through the form (气冲形)**,\npermeating all hundred limbs.\n**Fire refines the lead (火炼铅)**,\n**lead refines the mercury (铅炼汞)**,\nuniting the **three families (会合三家)**.\n\nWhen the practice reaches this stage,\nit is like the **dragon nurturing a pearl (龙养珠)**,\nlike the **hen brooding an egg (鸡抱卵)**—\never-present in thought, day and night unceasing,\nnaturally revealing the **primordial qi (先天一炁)**,\nmixing with the **pre-heaven yin essence of the separated palace (离宫之阴精)**,\ntransforming into one—\nwhere one does not know the **spirit as qi, the qi as spirit (神之为炁、炁之为神)**.\n\nYet this is not a matter of **retention in thought or deliberate action (存想有作为)**,\nbut rather **effortless spontaneity (自然而然)**—\na knowing without knowing how.\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"Last night, the chaos toppled to earth,\nall phenomena stand arrayed, yet none know whence.\"* **(夜来混沌颠落地，万象森罗总不知。)**\nThis is the sign.\n\nNow, regarding the **Small Circulation’s** fire timing—there are **cultivated (文)** and **martial (武)** methods, with **yin-yang correspondences** and **calculable measures**, yet the **Great Circulation’s** fire transcends both attachment and emptiness. At first, it seems neither bound to existence nor void, but in time, it settles into **Great Stillness (大定)**—where the **mercury’s** nature, prone to flight, no longer disperses, and is refined into a single block of **purple-gold frost**, motionless and undisturbed. This is the **posterior elixir’s** golden essence entering the **cinnabar field (泥丸)**, where lead is drawn and mercury added to forge the **Great Elixir**—the essence of the **Great Circulation’s** method.\n\nTruly, the initial **refinement of essence into qi** lies in the **Lower Field (下田)**, where this **pre-heaven true lead** is forged. Once the **Lower Field** is full, the abdomen swells like a pregnant woman’s. Then, all this lead is extracted to supplement the mercury. When the **Great Circulation’s** work begins, one merely observes before the body, following the **leftward rotation of the breath**. With prolonged observation, the **lead’s dryness** and the **mercury’s abundance** merge, and **spirit and qi** blend harmoniously—this is the sign of **refining mercury into spirit**.\n\nWhen the practice reaches this stage,\nthe **hundred vessels** cease,\n**fetal breathing** stabilizes,\nand **immortality** is achieved—**transcendence as a human sage**.\n\nYet during the **past trials of crossing thresholds and ingestion**, when the **qi is severed like death**, if one has not **nurtured the heart-field** or **accumulated vast merit**, many are ensnared by **demonic trials** and perish. Thus, one must **discern one’s true nature**—utterly free of impurity—before undertaking this **Great Work**, to **return the elixir of jade-fluid**. This is why ancient sages rarely revealed it, fearing deceitful imitators.\n\nBut those who cultivate only the **treasure of life** without **nurturing the nature**—even if they avoid demonic assaults—remain entangled in **worldly desires**, their **lustful habits** unchecked. Like **fox spirits or serpent demons**, they harm others without restraint.\n\nIn summary, to **return the elixir of jade-fluid**, one must **understand the depletion of spirit**:\n- **Overeating** dulls the spirit,\n- **Hunger** injures it,\n- **Excessive sleep** befogs it,\n- **Restlessness** scatters it,\n- **Excessive speech** weakens it,\n- **Overthinking** disrupts it,\n- **Lust** drains it.\nAll such **harmful actions, words, and habits** must be **abandoned early**.\n\nOnly then does the **heart harbor a solitary luminous essence**:\n- **Eyes** gaze inward,\n- **Breath** is contained within,\n- **Tongue’s luster** is preserved internally,\n- **Limbs move** yet remain steady,\n- **Mind reflects** yet is pure.\nAt first, one **strives to sustain** this, but in time, it flows **effortlessly**—\n**moving yet still, still yet moving**,\n**containing the utmost in emptiness, the utmost in fullness**,\n**embracing supreme vacuity yet absolute substance**.\nOnly then is **returning the elixir** no difficulty.\n\n---\n\n**Further Refinement of the Void**\n\nPreviously, **refining qi and spirit** was **relocating the furnace and cauldron** in the **Middle Field (中田)**, to **refine the true yin of the Separated Palace (离中真阴)**—what the ancients called **meditation in the Palace of Departure (离宫修定)**.\n\nAt this stage, the **essence has fully transformed into lead**, and thus **lead refines mercury**, encasing it firmly without leakage. Lead and mercury merge into one seamless mass, eventually forming a **yang spirit** that emerges from the **Vermilion Palace (绛宫)**, ascending to the **cinnabar field (泥丸)**. Suddenly, **spirit-light radiates**, piercing the heavens, and in an instant, it **wanders through the Five Lakes, Four Seas, Nine Regions, and Ten Thousand Lands**—its marvels beyond comprehension.\n\nYet one must first **clarify the origin of the heart-mind** before refining the **treasure of life**. From the moment of **unborn existence**, one’s **true nature** is **round and luminous**, **pure and empty of all things**. Only upon entering the world does **a single thought** weave the **form and substance** of the body. Even external objects—**beautiful wives, precious jade, fine gold, or all worldly splendor**—are **illusions born of attachment**. Though they may seem real, they are **dream-like and fleeting**, unable to endure.\n\nWith such **elevated vision** and **unbounded heart**, one must regard **all phenomena as external**, even the body as a **phantom form**. Only the **midst’s eternal, still essence**—**unborn, unending, and ever-present**—is **truly oneself**.\n\nIf one remains **untouched by external defilement** and **unmixed by internal thoughts**, ever aware of the **pure, luminous, void-awakening nature**, harmonized with the **beginning and end of heaven and earth**, then—**when the ten-month embryo is complete**—a **single point of yang spirit** manifests, emerging between **heaven and earth**, free to **roam unrestrained**.\n\nBut if one has **never cultivated the nature**, and merely **refined the treasure of life** to forge a **yang spirit**, then upon its emergence, it **must be swiftly recalled**. For without **clarity of the true nature** or **severance from worldly desires**, **pleasure and fear** will disturb the mind. The **Seven Emotions and Six Desires** can **seize the spirit**, and if not **immediately withdrawn**, one risks **a demonic snare stealing the soul**—or, even without harm, **a single thought may plunge one into rebirth**, unknown whether as a **horse or ox**.\n\nTruly, one’s practice reaching this realm has **endured countless hardships**, yet without **refining the void**, **external dangers persist**—how regrettable!\n\nAt this stage, those who **never cultivated the nature** must **reforge and refine anew**, **nurturing the heart internally** and **accumulating merit externally**, firmly grasping the **original round-luminous nature**. One must not **prematurely rejoice** and **release the yang spirit outward**, for even if no harm befalls them, it **still wanders beyond one’s control**.\n\nAt this point, one must **restabilize the Divine Furnace**, **reestablish the Divine Tripod**, and **directly return the already-formed yang spirit** to the **Näihuàn Palace of the Eight Scenes**, **nurturing it ceaselessly**—**sometimes manifest, sometimes latent**—through the **refinement of returning to the void**. One must **dissolve the original spirit** that was previously cultivated, **rendering it nonexistent**, utterly unaware that **the spirit is the void**, and **the void is the spirit**.\n\nAs **Zhuāngzi** said: *\"When the butterfly transforms into a man, and the man transforms into a butterfly, he does not know whether the butterfly is the man or the man is the butterfly. This is two, this is one; blurred and indistinct, with no way to break their boundary.\"* This is the true meaning of **returning to the void**.\n\nIf one **still does not recognize** that **my spirit is the void of the Great Emptiness**, and **the void of the Great Emptiness is also my spirit**, and **spirit and void cannot yet merge as one**, then one must **not rashly release it outward**.\n\nThough all things have **forms**, only the void has **none**; though all things have **names**, only the void has **none**. Yet in truth, **the vastness of heaven and earth**, **the remoteness of the four seas**, encompasses **not a single person, thing, grass, or tree** that is not contained within the void—**this is why it is beyond conception or utterance**.\n\nFor those who **practice and refine** to this stage, they may **ascend the Dharma Seat** alongside the **Great Awakened Tathāgata** and **attain the realm of the Buddha**.\n\nWith this **realm attained** and this **cause understood**, one may **transcend the spirit from its dwelling**, **exchange form and shed the shell**, and through the **Great Return of the Golden Elixir**, **avoid demonic entanglement and spectral intrusion**.\n\nOtherwise, **since the beginning of the eon**, who has **not had ancestral grudges or past enmities** yet to be **consummated and extinguished**? If one **has not clearly awakened**, **risen above the dusty world**, or **penetrated the gate of life and death**, then **demons will not cease to haunt**, or one may **be reborn as a woman**, or **take on a malevolent and fierce appearance**, or **manifest as palaces, halls, gold, jade, silks, and brocades**, or **all manner of fame, wealth, and noble titles**—**even gods, immortals, and celestial armies**. At this moment, those who **have not yet realized the true nature** will **rarely fail to have their spirit stolen, their soul taken away by others**. This is why **refining the void** is **an indispensable step for cultivators**.\n\nThough so, **if one merely sits in stillness daily**, **ignoring worldly affairs**, and **indifferent to the cares of life**, one **still cannot fulfill the inherent nature**, let alone **attain the boundless realm**. What then of those who **lack cultivation and virtue**, who **speak of not becoming an immortal**—**even if they achieve some success**, they **cannot partake in the Great Awakening of the Immortals** or **ascend to the Great Luo Heaven**, for **the celestial immortals** have **no need for such solitary, ascetic practitioners** who **harm their hearts and reason**. How could they **ever allow such individuals to join their ranks as immortals**?\n\nThose who **practice the Dao** must **cherish familial bonds and social order**, **cultivate the six virtues of yin**, and **broaden the scope of their nature**—**harmonizing with all people and sharing with all things**—to **fulfill the capacity of their nature**, **assist heaven and earth in their transformative nurturing**, and **establish the power of their nature**. Only then can one **truly align with heaven and earth**, **stand at the apex of the Dao**, and **what fear is there of not becoming an immortal**?\n\n**The Sequence of Refinement**\nEarlier, the **path of cultivation and refinement** was described—**from coarse to subtle**, **from existence back to nonexistence**. Each layer **deepens progressively**, with **no leaping ahead, no disorder, or no inversion of proper sequence**. Though **ancient analogies** may **not all be discarded**, they are **no longer as obscure** as those of the ancients, who **often spoke in riddles without direct explanation**.\n\nEven if **learners have not instantly reached the peak**, **experiencing each stage in turn**, there are **principles they cannot violate**—like a traveler on the road: **once far from home**, they must **return step by step from that distant place**, with **no shortcut to ascending the hall and entering the chamber**.\n\nIf one’s **spiritual root is inherently pure**, and **their innate substance is unblemished**, then it is **like a person who has not yet left their home**: **a turn of the head brings them back**, **a single thought suffices to return**. This **cannot be constrained by the order of the method**.\n\nThose who **can attain such mastery**—**immortals and sages**—are **sparse indeed throughout history**. What then of **ordinary mortals** who **can fully refine their essence and qi**, **penetrate their nature**, and **directly reach the supreme nirvana**? I **would not begrudge such individuals**, but **since the Three Dynasties onward**, those who **achieve this selection** are **exceedingly rare**.\n\nIn sum: **there is no subtle without coarse**, **no nonexistence without existence**. When **divided**, there are **three categories**; when **unified**, they are **the primordial true yang of the preheaven**. **Refining essence into qi** is **not about acquiring a separate essence or a separate qi**; it is **about reclaiming the innate essence and original qi** that have been **lost in the fields of sound, color, wealth, and desire**. **Gathering and returning them to the elixir field**, one **restores the true body of youth**—though this **still belongs to the postheaven true yang**, **far from comparing** to the **preheaven one qi**, which **has no outer boundary, no inner limit, no accumulation in entering, no dispersion in exiting**.\n\n**The Dao of the Great Return**\n\n**Thus, one must further advance with assiduous practice and the power of cultivation, refining this formed and colored embryo into the marvel of divine transformation—where neither *qi* nor spirit is known. One returns to the primordial void of preheaven *yuan-qi*, unseen when viewed, unheard when listened to, untouchable when grasped. If one regards it as *non-existence*, then movement and spirit follow naturally, filling the cosmos without interruption. If one regards it as *not non-existence*, then at the utmost stillness and depth, not a thread or grain can be perceived.\n\nWhen practice reaches this stage, it returns from the *Taiji*’s root to the *Wuji*’s true essence. Otherwise, if one clings only to postheaven *jing-qi*, unaware of preheaven divine transformation, one will inevitably fall into empty seated meditation, a withered *chan*. If one speaks only of preheaven divine transformation without cultivating postheaven *jing-qi*, one will end in reckless emptiness. Knowing the unity of *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life) in dual cultivation, yet leaping stages—prioritizing what should come later and vice versa—one risks chaos without order, confusion without sequence. Even if one enters the Dao, one will not avoid falling into one extreme or the other, unable to stand in the middle path and ascend to the gates of immortality and sagehood.\n\nI now transmit this essential teaching not in haste or recklessness, but because false paths proliferate and heretical doctrines multiply. They divide the Dao into sects, each clinging to a single interpretation, slandering our path. Reluctantly compelled, I was urged to compile this *Essentials of the Dao Gate* as a bridge for future generations. May those with resolve in this Way discern my earnest intent.\n\n**Clarifying the Practice of Self-Cultivation**\nThe terms *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life) are two in name but one in essence—our Dao calls it *double cultivation*.\n\nFor instance, in the *Guard the Center* practice, though one speaks of gathering scattered *qi* back to the *dantian* to refine preheaven true yang, without dispelling wandering thoughts and eliminating delusions, sweeping away all dusty entanglements, how could one return to the root breath by breath or enter samadhi at all times? Again, when true yang arises, one extracts the true lead from the *kan* vessel to refine the yin mercury of *li*, performing the *zi-wu* ascending-descending function and applying the *washing-bathing-nourishing* method to refine oneself and establish the foundation. Without purifying the mind, washing the heart, abandoning emotions, severing desires, restraining anger, and eliminating deceit to preserve sincerity, how could one balance water and fire, harmonize yin and yang, and form the millet-grain elixir to nurture the embryo? This is cultivating *ming*, yet cultivating *xing* is also inherent within it.\n\nWhen the *playing female* and *playing male* conceive, the elixir takes form, and at the hundred-day foundation stage, one must perform the *Great Circulation*. At this point, one must only preserve the spirit and discard thoughts, reduce desires and clarify the heart, to temper and refine the supreme yellow treasure. Without employing the *wuwei* divine fire and the *youzuo* true mechanism—ascending, descending, simmering, and refining—one cannot forge the yang spirit to burst through the celestial gate.\n\nOnce the yang spirit emerges and the great elixir returns, one must use the divine crucible and divine furnace, true fire and true medicine, refining in the *nirvana marrow palace*. If one merely speaks of utmost stillness and *wuwei*, waiting passively for it to spontaneously ascend to the ninth heaven, even the innate sages may fail to achieve emptiness and yet ascend on cranes to immortality.\n\nThough this is cultivating *xing*, cultivating *ming* is also within it.\n\nIn summary: *xing* is the original preheaven spirit, *ming* is the preheaven *yuan-qi*. Their origin lies in Heaven, their substance is complete within oneself. Though they may be divided for beginners’ understanding, fundamentally, divided they are two, united they are one. Those unclear on this Dao who cultivate only one path are not following the *Zhongyong* Way but stray into false doctrines.\n\nSome say the *Guard the Center* method has been fully explained—one center within the body, one not within the body. The subtle teachings passed from Yao, Shun, and Yu simply state: *\"Hold fast to the Center.\"* The Center is the beginning and end of cultivation; those who practice the Dao their entire lives cannot exhaust it, yet its clarity is already within sight. But as for the *Small* and *Great Circulations* you speak of—how exactly do they differ?\n\nI say: The *Small Circulation* is the stage of *kan-li* union, when external medicine is produced. Within a day’s twelve hours, whenever yang arises, one may perform it. The Pure Yang Ancestor says:\n*\"When the first yang stirs, the midnight water clock lingers,\nThe warm crucible glows—light pierces the curtains.\"*\n\nThis is when essence generates medicine; one should perform the *Small River-Car* practice. If not yet ready, one must not act recklessly and invite disaster.\n\nThe *Great Circulation* is when internal medicine forms and the embryo manifests—when yin and yang unite, a single point settles in the *Huangting*. Here, one must only remain in *non-duality*, neither clinging nor rejecting, employing a continuous, subtle spirit to perform the unceasing, uninterrupted function. Not a moment’s pause in a day and night. Guangchengzi says:\n*\"The elixir furnace and River-Car rest without haste,\nThe crane embryo and tortoise breath flow endlessly.\"*\n\nZhang Xian says:\n*\"All day long, drunkenly dazed,\nOnly guarding the cave’s eternal spring.\"*\n\nThus, the functions of the *Small* and *Great Circulations* differ.\n\nFrom this, one knows: it begins with *youzuo* (action) and ends with *wuwei* (non-action). When *wuwei* becomes *wuwei* yet *wu* (nothing) does not prevent *wei* (action), then the Dao is attained.\n\nThe student must first master the practice of self-refinement before performing this *wuwei* function, lest grave danger arise. If refinement is not yet complete, the peril is incalculable.\n\nThe first principle is to distinguish the fire and medicine clearly—fire must be precise in its timing, and the medicines must be known with certainty. One must not be negligent nor reckless, nor too slow nor too hasty, but especially diligent in cultivating virtue and accumulating good deeds, so as to move Heaven and the Divine to descend their favor, and to transform the malevolent forces of demons and obstacles into submission. Only then may one hope to achieve lasting attainment, where one success endures forever, and one danger never recurs.\n\nThis is the source of life and vitality, the Dao of dual cultivation. Yet already it has been written plainly and distinctly, yet later students still cling to one-sided views—some cultivating vitality without nurturing life, others nurturing life without cultivating vitality, each defending their own doctrine while disparaging others. Truly, this is the root of no hope for transcendence!\n\nAs for the functions of the Small and Great Circulations, internal and external medicines, and internal and external fires, I have briefly outlined their general principles. The scholar who reflects deeply upon these may truly comprehend their unchanging conditions.\n\nFrom ancient times, the great sages like Zhang and Lü accumulated sincerity and moved the Divine, striving thus to the second or third level before fully mastering the life-nurturing function. Yet in the cultivation of vitality, these two sages once gazed heavenward and sighed deeply, repeatedly and without pause, before receiving the transmission of the Dao and attaining true transcendence. How fortunate are later students to obtain this genuine instruction! Should they not strive earnestly?\n\n**The Functions of Fire and Medicine**\n\nBefore attaining the elixir, the most difficult aspect is mastering the external fire. Once the elixir is obtained, the most difficult aspect becomes mastering the internal fire.\n\nWhat is the external fire? It is the breath of one’s own inhalation and exhalation. What is the internal fire? It is the subtle, natural breath that arises when one adjusts and refines the inhalation and exhalation—an essence that is both present and absent.\n\nEssentially, the external breath, though appearing as something, must ultimately return to nothingness. The internal essence-breath, though seemingly nothing, must not be grasped as something. If one forcibly clings to nothingness while seeking something, not only will the internal essence-breath fail to manifest, but even the external breath will become unrefined.\n\nThe *Mirror of Medicine* states: *\"Heaven responds with stars, Earth with tides—this is the external fire.\"* Master Ziyang says: *\"The true fire of Heaven is naturally present; no need for fuel or forced breathing—this is the internal fire.\"*\n\nKnow that though fire has two forms, their ultimate essence is one: a continuous, subtle *qi* that is soft yet dense, fine yet profound.\n\nLaozi says: *\"Soft and continuous, like something ever-present—yet its use is not forced.\"*\n\nMaster Cui says: *\"The *qi* of Primordial Heaven, the *qi* of Postnatal Heaven—those who attain it seem perpetually drunk.\"*\n\nFrom this reflection, one knows that the two breaths—external and internal—are but one continuous, subtle *qi*.\n\nIf the scholar truly grasps this rhythm, circulating it through every joint and node of the body, the *qi* will flow vast and unceasing, without pause or interruption. The entire body will feel supple as silk, refreshingly invigorated—only to see it surging like waves, dense yet fine, rising naturally and descending effortlessly, opening and closing in perfect harmony, moving and returning in accordance with Heaven’s unfailing course.\n\nWhen the student possesses this true Yang fire, even long-standing stubborn illnesses—whether in the limbs or organs—will dissolve under its pressure, turning into sweat that emerges through every pore of the body. If some illnesses remain untransformed, it is merely because the fire’s power is still weak, and the true Yang *qi* has not yet been obtained.\n\nFor Yang is vigor, is strength—its nature is inherently dynamic. Illnesses in the body often arise from Yang weakness and Yin excess, congealing into deep-seated, chronic afflictions. Yet once the true fire’s condition is attained, it is like winter snow, firm and unyielding, but when spring’s warmth arrives, even the longest-frozen ice cannot resist melting under the sun’s rays. So too, the body’s illnesses, which are nothing but congealed Yin *qi*, must dissolve under the influence of this true Yang *qi*.\n\nThus, the Dao’s ability to dispel illness is not due to any special method—it is merely the attainment of Heaven and Earth’s true Yang *qi*.\n\nAs for medicines, there are several types. Initially, one refines coarse breath into the Primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth, gathering it in the elixir field. With time, true transformation arises—this is the external fire refining the innate Primordial *qi*, which the ancients called *\"the mother of the child\"* (i.e., the true gold born from water).\n\nOne must know: Heaven and Earth’s Dao is simply Naturalness. How much more so when refining the elixir adheres to the patterns of the Primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth! There is no Dao that does not follow Naturalness while still relying on human effort.\n\nAfter the union of Heaven and Earth, a point of Primordial Yang falls into the Yin, changing into *Kàn* (Abyss). Kàn water is cold by nature—without the radiance of the Divine descending upon it, it congeals into harsh Yin, and neither water rises nor gold emerges. But when the Yang fire presses upon it, naturally the fire steams and the water boils, and the true gold floats upward. The Primordial Yang gold, hidden within the water, refined by the true fire, returns to the state of Non-Extremity, growing ever clearer with each refinement—this is called *true gold*, the innate elixir of the body. Yet after birth, desires and thoughts muddy it, and a veil of malevolent Yin *qi* obscures the gold, just as animal charcoal placed in an icy cellar is congealed by cold, and the Yang cannot emerge alone. Now, with the true fire’s scorching, suddenly the Primordial gold returns from the Abyss—thus the Dao calls it *external medicine*, though it is inherently one’s own.\n\nFrom this manifestation of Yang, one must not let it rise and sink at will, flying beyond control. Nor should it be wasted in daily actions, merely to display one’s cleverness and brilliance. Instead, one must learn the sages’ method of the River-Car’s ascent and descent, guiding this true lead upward into the *Lí* (Clarity) palace, to refine the Yin mercury within it. Thus, Yin and Yang harmonize as one family, merging into unity, neither flying nor straying. With prolonged practice, the Yin of Clarity transforms naturally, and the true Yang is born—this is the *internal medicine*.\n\n「Yet, why must the Yin within *Lí* (Clarity) await the true Yang from *Kǎn* (Abyss)? Indeed, *Lí* belongs to Fire; without the Water of *Kǎn*, its *qi* grows faint and languid, erupting as the Seven Emotions and Six Desires, giving rise to inexplicable eccentricities and monstrosities. Even without such monstrosities, without Water to temper Fire, it will daily and nightly surge uncontrollably outward, unable to be gathered or restrained—like Water and Fire dwelling together, bound to consume utterly before ceasing.\n\nThus, the reason mortals fail to attain longevity is that their *shén* (spirit) and *qì* (vital essence) are ever dispersing, with no true Water to subdue them. Hence, they burn out and die. If one practices this alchemy, initially one uses the spirit-fire to illuminate downward, refining the gold from within *Kǎn*. Then, with the gold and water united, one subdues the Fire of *Lí*—so the *external medicine* is born from the union of *Kǎn* and *Lí*, while the *internal medicine* is nurtured by the harmonization of Yin and Yang. In truth, all is Yang seeking Yin and Yin seeking Yang, forged through their mutual configuration—thus the matter of human transcendence is complete.\n\nFrom this, one must again place this Yang spirit back into the crucible and furnace, re-establishing the *Buǎn* (Crucible) and *Kǎn* (Abyss), using the harmonized Yin-Yang spirit to ascend once more into the *Níwán* (Cinnabar) palace, refining an indestructible golden body. This is no separate Dao; it is the spirit of Yin-Yang union, wholly drawn from the physical form. Yet it remains entangled with grossness and heaviness, unable to soar through the skies or traverse lightning, to ride the mist or harness the clouds, to dwell in the void of empty space without decay. Therefore, one must further elevate this Yang spirit—now embodied—into the realm of *Qīngxū* (Empty Clarity), within the singular aperture of the void above. Thus, with breath that is without breath, and spirit that is without spirit, one refines from the embodied to the formless, from the conditioned to the unconditioned—this is the moment of the great elixir’s Fire refining and medicinal maturity. In essence, it is the pure Yang of Empty Clarity uniting with the Yin-Yang of the singular aperture.\n\nWhen this great work is achieved, it is merely the Primordial *yuánqì* (Original Vital Essence) of Nature itself—ultimately, what is there and what is not? I reiterate: let it be purely the task of following Nature.\n\nFor mortals seeking this path, one must first understand the origin of cultivation and refinement, lest one blindly practice and recklessly act, inviting misfortune. This is why ancient Daoist masters were reluctant to reveal it—now I disclose it for all under Heaven and for future generations. May it be cherished and treasured.\n\n**Discourse on Early Human Cultivation**\nAncients first established their foundation by mastering the *tuóluò* (Hollow Bell), meaning the gathering of spirit and the concentration of *qì*.\n\nIndeed, without gathering the spirit, it becomes chaotic; without concentrating the *qì*, it disperses. Spirit is the master of *qì*, and *qì* is the auxiliary of spirit. If one does not first gather the spirit, the *qì* will float and drift externally, unable to condense within the body—it will inevitably scatter and diminish daily, with sickness and death arising thereafter. How then could one nurture the elixir within and achieve transcendence?\n\nThe ancients said: *\"When the spirit returns, the qì naturally submits.\"* This is the indispensable principle for cultivators.\n\nAs for the crucible and furnace, they are but this physical form itself. The lute and sword are but the embodiment of discarding desire and preserving principle. The *Xuānmǔ* (Mysterious Mother) is but the recognition of the true mechanism in motion. The *Shǒuchéng* (Guarding the City) is but the understanding of medicinal refinement within prescribed boundaries, using Fire to temper and nourish. The *Yězhàn* (Wild Battle) is but the initial extraction of the medicinal Fire. Though their names vary, all are metaphorical analogies concealing the profound mysteries of the Dao. If scholars diligently follow these without slackening, their cultivation will be without error. Though they may not ascend to the ranks of the Golden Immortals, they can still repel illness, extend their years, and forever enjoy the blessings of human prosperity and longevity.\n\nIn sum, one can never depart from the essential step of refining the heart, nor from the indispensable accumulation of merit and cause-and-effect.\n\nFor those who enter this gate, fortunate to hear the true instructions, they must not stray into false paths or external doctrines. How many lifetimes of diligent cultivation of Yin and Yang, how vast the accumulation of Daoist karmic connections, before one encounters this today? Otherwise, they would never meet it, and even if they did, they would pass it by in error. Moreover, their doubt and faith would be mixed, unable to generate unwavering conviction and resolve.\n\nSince one has encountered this Daoist fate, the first imperative is not to treat it lightly. Cultivate diligently, and forge this Fire into completion, lest one abandon the crucible and start anew. If one encounters it yet does not cultivate, or cultivates yet without diligence, I fear that good karmic fate will vanish while malevolent connections arise—before one can even realize it, such opportunities may never return again.\n\nMoreover, the times are not those of a great *jiè* (calamity/eon). The age of five hundred years, where the worthy rise and the upright live, has not yet arrived. Though one may have cultivated great virtue and gathered Daoist connections in many lives, if the time is not yet ripe, the Immortals and Saints will not descend, and one will still not hear this great Dao.\n\nNow, having been born in this time and heard its teachings, fortunate to dwell in an era of peace, the blessings bestowed are already great—bestowed by Heaven. At this juncture, if one does not exert every effort to achieve it, when else shall one await?\n\nFor merit and virtue vary in magnitude, so too does the attainment of transcendence differ in rank. It cannot be uniform.\n\nFor instance, refining *jīng* (Essence) into *qì* (Vital Essence) to repel illness, extend life, and achieve human transcendence; refining *qì* into *shén* (Spirit) to return to the Original and reclaim one’s destiny, attaining Earthly transcendence; refining *shén* to return to the void, or attuning the spirit to emerge from the shell, achieving Heavenly transcendence. Though transcendence has many grades, all depend on the Heavenly Deities assessing one’s merit and granting rewards—none can be achieved solely by one’s own cultivation efforts.\n\nNext, even in one’s lifetime, if the spirit is concentrated with unwavering resolve, after death one becomes the sovereign of the *língtán* (Spiritual Altar). If one is wise, upright, compassionate, and benevolent in life, after death one becomes the guardian deity of the land and its harvests. Again, if one greatly cultivates merit and widely sows fields of virtue—whether by sacrificing one’s body in peril or saving the people of the realm—though one may not become a deity, in future lives one will surely be reborn as an emperor or king. Or if one honors the lonely and aids the widowed, respects the aged and pities the poor, in future lives one will become a wealthy household patriarch. If one resolves conflicts, donates resources to build benevolent acts, in future lives one may become a noble’s son. Such varied good causes all bear their own fruits—one reaps what one sows. The Heavenly Deities merely grant rewards according to what one cultivates; it is not the power of *Yánluó* (Underworld Deities) to create destiny for mortals.»\n\nThe scholar I exhort: if one has not heard the Dao, let it be. But once one has heard it, one must pursue it to its utmost without ceasing. If there arises a sluggish or weary heart, let one reflect: *\"Now that I have fortunately encountered the transmission of the Immortals, if this body is not transcended in this life, then in what life shall it be?\"* Moreover, favorable moments do not recur, and joyous affairs are not constant. One may fear that after this time, there will be no more auspicious occasions or fortunate gatherings. If one does not urgently cultivate and practice, one may fear that after this moment, a thousand kalpas may pass before another chance arises, drifting aimlessly in the tumultuous, rolling world. To then turn one’s fate and break free would be most difficult indeed.\n\nWhen one awakens thus with such vigor, one’s spirit naturally clears and one’s *qi* grows robust. There will be no lack of energy in one’s practice. One must always maintain an awakened, illuminating mind and the power of sudden realization, holding fast to it without losing it. Then, those with sincere hearts will not be abandoned by Heaven, and those with resolve will achieve their aims.\n\nAs for the subtle and secret aspects, though not all have been fully revealed, the difference lies only in minor details. If one internally cultivates essence and life, and externally accumulates virtue and merit without slackening in resolve, the Heavenly Deities will surely guide and bestow their favor. For human whispers are heard by Heaven like thunder, and hidden misdeeds are seen by the Divine like lightning. How could those who diligently practice the Dao fail to have their every thought and intention known to the Heavenly Deities, who hold them in special affection?\n\nOne need not fear that the true transmission of the Dao is unattainable—only that having received it, one fails to exert oneself in applying it. Let future scholars heed my words and strive accordingly.\n\n**Teachings to the Disciples on Seated Meditation and Stillness**\n\nYou disciples have recently practiced seated meditation and stillness, refining the methods of ascent and descent, yet have not yet reached the proper state. Though ascent and descent are coarse practices, they too have their methods. If one ascends too high, the spirit and *qi* will inevitably scatter; if one descends too low, one risks falling into torpor and drowsiness. If one does not know that prolonged ascent must be followed by descent, and that extreme descent must be followed by ascent, then remaining too high invites the onset of fire and disease, while remaining too low invites the *qi* to be driven downward and dissipated. The harm from this is beyond measure.\n\nEven in a single inhalation and exhalation, there is ascent and descent. At first, one directs the mind to descend into the *dāntián* (elixir field), then guides it upward from the *wěilú* (tailbone aperture) to the *níwán* (brain’s marrow palace), and finally descends it into the *tǔfū* (earth furnace). This single inhalation and exhalation encompasses ascent and descent. Even the three hundred and sixty revolutions of the *lúnché* (circular orbit) and the application of the *héchē* (river vehicle) method adhere to this principle.\n\nAt first, the essence sinks into the Water Palace, submerged and unmoving, and one must resort to violent fire to force it upward. Yet when it ascends, one must not overuse the mind—it must rise lightly and subtly, as if with intention yet without intention, as Mencius said: *\"Do not forget, yet do not assist.\"* When the spirit and *qi* ascend, one’s vision transcends the world, and one’s measure encompasses Heaven and Earth. This is the Dao’s spring and summer—flourishing and nurturing all things. At this stage, one must not force further ascent, for doing so would disperse the spirit and *qi* without return, exhausting them until they are spent. Thus, the Daoists have the method of descent, which is also concealment: *\"Hide the heart in the abyss, merge the *qi* in the void,\"* drawing all the senses—eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind—into the profoundest orifice. This is the Dao’s autumn and winter—retreat, concealment, returning to the root, and restoring life.\n\nIf one conceals in this manner for a long time, whether asleep or awake, one must know that while the body sleeps, the mind does not. Only then can one avoid torpor and dissipation. This is what Confucius meant by *\"sleeping without rigidity\"*—not merely drawing up the feet and contracting the head to resemble a corpse, as the world mistakenly supposes. Ordinary people, when asleep, are like the dead, unresponsive even to calls. But the adept sleeps in body yet remains awake in spirit; the *qi* is still, yet the mind is ever-alert. If there is no sound, it is as if nothing exists, but at the slightest disturbance, one is instantly and vividly aware. This is the Dao’s method of sleep.\n\nDisciples, can you attain this state even in sleep? If not, do not seek other signs elsewhere. Simply recall how, when faced with urgent matters, though asleep, your mind could not be put down—so that even the slightest touch would awaken you. With this realization, you will naturally understand the method of sleeping in body yet remaining awake in spirit.\n\nIn essence, it is a matter of rousing the spirit and sharply awakening it, never allowing even a single thought to slacken. Yet this is but a provisional method for those who have not yet attained a sudden awakening. Once the mind’s subtleties are mastered, such rigid adherence is no longer necessary.\n\nWhen this mind is concealed in the obscure and void, over time, the natural emergence of *yáng* (the creative force) will inevitably arise. If there is no place of return, how could there be the birth of true *yáng*? Even if there appears to be, it is but an illusion, not the genuine birth of *yáng*.\n\nIt is said that the deeper the concealment, the more profound the attainment. Since your true *yáng* is not yet full, do not focus solely on the generation of *yáng-qi*. You must first engage in this quiet nourishment. Only when essence is abundant and *qi* is strong will true *yáng* naturally emerge with irresistible force. Otherwise, without the autumn-winter concealment, how could there be spring-summer flourishing?\n\nIn short, the method of ascent and descent is evident in the four seasons of a year, or in the single day and night of Heaven. Know that even in a single breath, there is ascent and descent, and in every revolution of the *zhōutiān* (circular orbit), there is ascent and descent. Let the diligent scholar discern these subtle shifts within oneself—whether ascent or descent is called for—and never err by even a hair’s breadth. Only then will there be no suffering from fire-heat or water-coldness.\n\nWhen the time for concealment arrives, there will be the gathering of the three flowers at the crown, the five *qi* paying homage to the primal, the harmonization of the five phases, and the clustering of the four symbols. If one has not reached this stage, then the upper and lower will be disconnected—*lì* (fire) above and *kǎn* (water) below—uncoordinated, like the liver and lungs, which do not communicate. When you sit in meditation, the external *qi* is unregulated, the internal *qi* is restless, the ascending *qi* does not descend, and the descending *qi* does not ascend—this is the state of *lì* and *kǎn* not interacting. The *qi* on either side of the *dāntián* moves like two doors opening and closing—one collision, then another, then parting again—this is the state of the Dragon and Tiger not uniting.\n\nThe disciples must first unite the external *qi* with the internal *qi* into a single mass, gathering the upper, lower, left, and right into one place. This is the very essence of the three flowers clustering at the crown, the five *qi* returning to the primal. At this time, the true essence from *lì* (fire) and the elemental *qi* from *kǎn* (water) are bridged by a single point of true breath, acting as the matchmaker. Thus, the three families merge into one, forming a perfect unity of the primordial harmony. Only then can one truly speak of refining the elixir. If even one aspect is not aligned, the elixir cannot be formed. It is like a husband and wife in union—all the spirit and *qi* of the four limbs, five senses, and hundred bones converge in the *dāntián*; thus, life is generated and children nurtured, with every fetus possessing all its parts. If even one aspect fails to gather, there will be deficiencies—such as missing ears, noses, or having only one foot or hand—which arise from the parents' union when one place does not coalesce.\n\nTo cultivate the great elixir and manifest countless myriad forms, one must first gather essence and refine spirit, encompassing the primal *qi* of the body within the mysterious void of a single orifice. Then, the elixir will naturally form without seeking it. Know well that the Dao has its fixed principles, but the methods are not rigid. Just as scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants each pursue their own craft, all can nourish the body and sustain the family without being confined to a single path. Only the inherent nature of Heaven and the conscience of humanity are the fundamental roots of our existence, a fixed good that no person can lack. If one does not seek it within but instead demands it from without, striving to make a farmer like a scholar or a scholar like a merchant, it will be impossible to achieve harmony.\n\nHaving understood this, you must see that the holy teachings of the three religions each have their own methods, yet all return to the one Dao. Otherwise, clinging to one as correct while rejecting another as false, there will be endless contention and conflict. If you truly grasp this, even the lesser practices of peripheral schools will hold no ill will for you. Yet, your flawed and leaky bodies must first engage in the study of preserving and creating life, fortifying your spirit and essence before you can attain the great wisdom to illuminate the Dao, the great spirit to bear the Dao, and the great strength to support it. The foundation for ascending from lower learning to higher enlightenment must be clearly understood within yourself, grasping its truth so as not to be deceived by others.\n\nNow, the hearts of people are daily corrupted, and the customs of the world grow increasingly perverse, all because the great Dao is not clearly understood. To reverse the decline of the world and rectify human hearts, one must first make the Dao clear and plain, speaking it directly, so that the muddled world may transform into one of pure and virtuous customs.\n\nThough the writings of immortals and Buddhas are numerous, those who truly point out the original source and penetrate the essence of life and nature are few indeed. Is this because the immortals and sages do not care for the root but chase after the branches? Rather, it is because the world and its people are deeply entrenched in delusion and mired in ignorance. Even if you speak of lower learning, it still feels distant and unpalatable—how much more so the highest, supreme teachings of the Dao! Only you can comprehend the shared origin of the three religions and the unity of inner and outer, so I, as your teacher, have been commanded to reveal these profound truths to the world.\n\nThis initial practice is merely the study of preserving life, not yet the attainment of mastering nature. Yet know that our Dao practices both nature and life together—though called refining life, nature is inherent within it. If one refines life without nature, then where does the primordial elixir come from?\n\nMy disciples are many, but only you can truly understand the source of nature and the root of life and the Dao. You must begin with solid, grounded practice rather than empty speculation. Beyond you, some only know how to refine life but not nature, while others know how to refine nature but not life. These are all one-sided; what use do they have for the central Dao?\n\nExhort the disciples: To become a person of the highest order, you must do the highest deeds. To do the highest deeds, you must first harbor the highest heart and establish the highest aspiration. In all matters of daily sustenance—food, drink, clothing, and shelter—you must rise above the common crowd, not consorting with the mediocre. Otherwise, though your heart aspires to the Dao of immortals and sages, your actions and behavior remain no different from ordinary mortals. Do not speak of knowing the marvels—even if you do, it is mere empty words, offering no benefit to body or mind.\n\nConsider further: Those who study the Dao of immortality are meant to transcend humanity and enter sainthood. Ask yourself: How do I transcend the common? How do I enter the sacred? This shows that the practitioner of the Dao, though not stepping outside the principles of Heaven and human nature, must reject what the crowd loves, shun what the crowd hates, avoid what the crowd does, and embrace what the crowd avoids. Only by reflecting thus in every matter, standing apart from the vulgar, can one become an extraordinary gentleman.\n\nIf you merely admire the teachings of the sages in your heart but do not share their aspiration or follow their path, if you daily engage with the world in its noise and distractions, even if you attain fire and elixir, it will be no more than the phantom transformations of a spirit with five senses. You will be but a spectral ghost of limited power—how much less can you hope to transcend the world and enter the realm of the immortal sages! Even if you do not turn from the vulgar ways of the crowd and enter the sacred halls, the elixir you refine will not be true elixir, and the fire you cultivate will not be true fire. Without true fire and true elixir, even the formation of ordinary elixir to ward off illness and prolong life is impossible. How much more so the hope of rising above the world and becoming a transcendent immortal?\n\nThe living must first cultivate this resolve with unwavering effort. Above all, they must begin with patience and forbearance—what others cannot endure, I must endure; what others do not yield, I must yield. Thus, they cast off worldly attachments and summon the relentless resolve to press forward with single-minded devotion to the Dao of Benevolence. Fearless of hardship and peril, they must strive with all their might to cross over, only then breaking free from the prison of sorrow and escaping the sea of suffering. Otherwise, though they turn their hearts toward the Way and yearn for the transcendent, they remain like one foot still mired in the sea of suffering while the other stands on the distant shore—forever wavering, never reaching the state of serene and spontaneous enlightenment.\n\nI exhort you: if you do not know the Great Dao, let it be. But if you know it, then act with all your strength. If you do not understand worldly desires, let them be. But if you understand them, then cast them aside completely—do not linger with hesitation, lest you obstruct your own cultivation and impede your path.\n\nHow much more so when one pursues both reason and desire in parallel—delighted by the Dao when seen within, yet equally enticed by the world’s splendor when seen without—unable to sever with decisive resolve? How could true essence and true elixir ever arise from such division?\n\nWhen one’s years advance and vital essence and blood dwindle, suddenly seeking elixir is beyond one’s power. Instead, they must adhere to the Method of Nourishing the Center. Once the Center is long preserved, the primordial yang stirs faintly—this is the birth of essence. At this stage, one need not yet employ the Circulation of the Microcosmic Orbit; merely elevate and withdraw to recover the essence in the Middle Palace. When the yang contracts like that of a child, this is sufficient. If one invokes the fire of the Microcosmic Orbit, the elixir will be weak while the fire rages strong, causing the elixir to dissipate along with the fire. Moreover, improper fire use invites countless ailments.\n\nYet when essence first emerges, it is still indistinct, like a child unaware of male and female—suddenly it solidifies, and this is true essence. If even a trace of lustful thought intrudes, the water source becomes impure and unusable.\n\nMoreover, when essence first forms, its *qi* remains faint—only a warmth, with no true essence yet. If one allows the external yang to surge uncontrollably, and either ignores its collection or fails to gather it, in an instant the *qi* will transform into essence and flow outward through the familiar path. Thus, at the outset, to nurture the rising yang and lengthen wisdom, one must first accumulate essence and gather *qi*—for every fraction of essence obtained, a fraction of *qi* is likewise gathered. Over time, as essence and *qi* fill, the symbol of the Return of Primordial Yang appears.\n\nThough *qi* grows, it is not the *qi* of ordinary breathing, but the *qi* of the Primordial Essence. Primordial Essence is formless, while breathing is formed—formless essence must borrow from the formed to manifest. The initial breathing seems both present and absent, subtle and soundless, entering and exiting without trace.\n\nIf external breathing remains coarse and unrefined, lacking harmony, the Primordial Essence will be disrupted by it, unable to govern itself. As it rises and falls, it will dissipate throughout the body’s blood and flesh, making it impossible to condense into elixir or complete the alchemical work.\n\nAs for fire, there is the fire of breathing, the fire of Primordial Essence, and the fire of Primordial Spirit. The fire of breathing transforms the *qi* of grain and essence into Primordial Essence. The fire of Primordial Essence transforms the breath of breathing into Primordial Spirit. The fire of Primordial Spirit refines the fire of Primordial Essence into the Great Elixir.\n\nAt first, the use of fire is merely to regulate the breath. Once the breath is harmonized, the Primordial Essence naturally appears. One must discern these transformations clearly and precisely—never yielding to impulsive haste. Impatience damages the Primordial Essence, which is why the ancients taught that when first embarking on practice, one must regard worldly distractions as empty, never engaging in debate with them. Having seen through worldly toil, one must not rely on cleverness or force. As for all unrighteous deeds, they are beyond consideration.\n\nAbove all, one must avoid sluggishness—sluggishness prevents the Primordial Essence from coalescing. How then could elixir or elixirization ever arise? Hence the saying: *\"Only the precise and singular may steadfastly hold the Center.\"*\n\nThe fire of Primordial Essence is both the yin-fire of the *Li* (Tricity) and the yang-fire of the *Kàn* (Water). When first initiating practice, one directs the gaze downward to the elixir field—this is the yin-fire of *Li*. At this stage, one must neither cling nor reject, forgetting yet aiding, in accordance with the Way of Nature. If the pace is too hasty or too slow, the gold in water cannot be forced forth. Later, when the gold in water is driven out by the yin-fire of *Li*, the external yang stirs, and the elixir field grows warm. Now the yang-fire of *Kàn* emerges to act—but this fire is impulsive. The practitioner must vigilantly restrain it, lest in an instant it transforms into post-heaven lust and flows outward through the familiar path. This must be guarded against above all.\n\nIn summary, fire has both gentle and fierce forms, both bathing and nourishing. First, one must use fire without appearing to use it—this is the true attainment. The practitioner must refine external breathing while quietly observing the inner transformations, only then returning the elixir and completing the Great Work.\n\nYet why observe the true breath within? When external breathing exhales, the internal Primordial Essence descends in absorption. When external breathing inhales, the internal Primordial Essence ascends in exhalation. These subtleties are known only to enlightened teachers and those who have penetrated the Dao’s mysteries.\n\nThe practitioner must focus on regulating the external breath, carefully discerning the rise and fall of the inner **qi (元炁)**. When these subtles are clearly understood, the elixir will not be difficult to refine.\n\nThis is the first essential secret for cultivating adepts—let those who hear it not treat it lightly.\n\n**When one’s true nature is recognized**, there is perception, and with perception come attachments. From attachments arise fear, confusion, and illusory fantasies. The mind moves on its own; I do not understand it myself, yet claim others can solve it?\n\nBut illusions arise from human existence—how can an old monk like me truly solve this with a single word? This very failure to understand is the true understanding, the wondrous understanding. Grasping this, all forms dissolve into emptiness: neither born nor extinguished, neither defiled nor pure, yet returning to the Original Nature. This is called having no wisdom and yet no lack—**no attainment**.\n\nIn days past, the Fifth Ancestor expounded the *Diamond Sutra (金剛經)* until the verse *“Let the mind not dwell in anything” (應無所住而生其心)*, and the Sixth Ancestor instantly awoke to its meaning, declaring:\n*“How could I know my true nature is originally pure and calm! How could I know my true nature is neither born nor extinguished! How could I know my true nature is inherently complete! How could I know my true nature is unshaken! How could I know my true nature can give rise to all dharmas (萬法)!”*\n\nRecognizing this heart’s wondrous, luminous, and perfect stillness, it is not bound by place or form—its essence is beyond all arising. Thus one knows that enlightenment lies not in mere words, but in the pity that common folk hear the profound truth yet fail to grasp it.\n\n**Liao-Liao Zi’s Record (了了子自記):**\nTo cultivate the Dao, why must one leave the home?\nWith a pure heart and few desires, one surpasses ordinary life.\nAll schemes and strivings are cast aside—\nWho knows this is the very essence of Dao cultivation?\n\nWhen Dao cultivation is truly mastered, it is splendid:\nOn Kunlun’s peak, three elixirs gather.\nWith harmonized **qi (和氣)**, a seed forms—\nLater, a strange child is born.\n\nThe child curses his old father as unjust:\n*“You raised me to be a bandit!”*\nAt the assembly of immortals, he offers the coiled peach—\nThen steals one back, laughing *haha*.\n\nI laugh at those in the world who claim to love the Dao,\nYet few know its true secret.\nThose who know it lack perseverance,\nSaying only that common folk cannot attain it.\n\n**Written with Deep Feeling (有感而作):**\nAncient sages cultivated True Dao within—\nUnrefined jade and pure gold as one body.\nThe enlightened naturally harbor a mind of salvation,\nYet across the world, few are worthy companions.\n\nThe difference lies in mere trifles—\nHow can the vulgar discern right and wrong?\nWho among them can truly inquire?\nBy the time they recognize it, their lives have already flown.\n\nI too, in my ordinary way, have labored to exhort others,\nYet my urgings meet only with scorn.\nTheir foolish hearts cling like spring dreams—\nI wonder when they’ll wake from their delusion.\n\nTurning back to goodness is turning from folly,\nLeaping into the boat to ferry others across.\nWith fierce resolve, I propel them to the far shore—\nEven in the Great Eon, I fear no calamity.\n\n**Nighttime Awakening to Dao, Suddenly Laughing and Composing This as a Record (夜間悟道忽笑作此以記之):**\nLaughing at the Dao’s profound mysteries, I grasp its marvels.\nWho knows the Great Dao is ever ordinary?\nPity that the world fails to perceive it.\n\n**Yuan-Yang Daoist’s True Play (圓陽道士真遊戲):**\nThe Daoist of Kunlun’s peak truly revels in play,\nSeeking the Dao, he abandons office like discarded shoes.\nEight years without a mate, he dreams of lonely dwelling—\nCold nights, iron pillow, and a chilled *yuan-li (鴛被)* for his bed.\n\nBehold his visage—\nHis beard and mustache turned white.\nCount his years—\nYet still, life’s vigor remains.\n\nI urge you to seek the Yellow Midwife early,\nTo take a lovely wife.\nA man’s chaos, a woman’s inversion—\nThe Heavenly Maiden of TianTai as a gentle husband.\n\nIn the nuptial chamber, they know not heaven nor earth,\nTheir natures harmonize, their fates aligned like brows.\nMuddled and indistinct, yet then they see your true heart,\nFaint and hazy, yet then they see your true intent—\nThis is the very beginning of the path to immortality.\n\n**Li Xi-Yue (李西月):**\nSix feet tall, his frame towering,\nEncompassing the Three Thousand Realms (三千界).*\n\nMan is called a stinking hide of leather,\nI name it a fragrant pouch of flesh—\nBorrowing virtue to cultivate the Dao,\nWasting away the body in vain.\n\nThe fool seeks to cast it aside,\nLeaping beyond heaven and earth;\nThe sage of highest rank attains perfect freedom,\nIn liberty, yet ever at ease.",

one secret, and this is it.\n\nCultivate the Dao with stillness and non-action,\nand all places and times are its domain.\n\nNo need to practice static meditation or empty contemplation—\nnature itself brings stillness where it will.\n\nThe Dao is originally natural, without beginning or end,\nwithout motion or rest.\n\nIf one would have no affairs of the heart,\none must first have no heart for affairs.\n\nNeither good nor evil should be weighed—\nwhat greater human desire than *Heaven’s Principle*?\n\nLike a mirror’s light without a mirror,\nit responds only when something comes.\n\nOriginally, perfect awareness is round and bright—\nwhy labor to refine oneself or restrain oneself?\n\nThe eyes are naturally luminous,\nyet even a speck of dust can obscure them.\n\nHeaven and Earth are originally boundless—\nwhat evil is there, and what cause for joy?\n\nThough it seems there is doing and making,\nits beginning and end are without trace.\n\nEven forced effort returns to naturalness,\nand marvelously enters the logic of non-action.\n\nNow that *Dao Gate Essential Speeches* is published,\nhere is a brief account of its intent.\n\n**Investigating the Origin of Nature and Life**\n\nThe *Yijing* speaks of the *Taiji*—\nfrom which arise the two principles.\n\nThe *Taiji* is *Nature* (*xing*),\nthe two principles are *Life* (*ming*).\n\nThough named differently,\nin reality, *Nature* is the master,\nflowing between yin and yang.\n\nYet *Nature* is without trace,\nwhile *Life* has subtle traces;\n*Nature* knows no birth or death,\nwhile *Life* has birth and death;\n*Nature* knows no beginning or end,\nwhile *Life* has beginning and end;\n*Nature* knows no motion or rest,\nwhile *Life* has motion and rest.\n\nBefore *Life* exists, the principle of *Nature* hangs vast in Heaven and Earth.\nOnce *Life* is born, the principle of *Nature* is already complete within the body.\n\nGreat is *Nature*!\nNothing can surpass it.\n\nYet without *Life*, *Nature* has no means to manifest—\nthus *Nature* and *Life* must be united, inseparable.\n\nFrom the moment of conception by one’s parents,\na point of luminous spirit is hidden within the embryo.\nThe primordial *Nature* transforms into the yin elixir of *li* (separation),\nthe primordial *Life* transforms into the yang lead of *kan* (abyss)—\nthis is called *original qi*.\n\nFrom this, water and fire rise and fall in alternation,\nspirit and *qi* intertwine, and heart and kidneys form.\nWith long nourishment, the fetus matures.\n\nThus, emerging from the womb,\none carves out one’s own heaven and earth.\n\nThough bound by form and substance,\none is not far from the original *qi* of Heaven and Earth—\nfor in ignorance and unawareness, without doing or making,\none’s distance from Heaven and Earth is not great.\nThus, the body grows daily, wisdom unfolds,\nand there are things known without knowing how.\n\nBy the time of twenty-eight years, the body is fully formed,\nand the *jin* (measure of weight) is complete.\nIf one does not know the art of returning,\none is swayed by customs,\nand desire arises, clinging to sounds and colors,\nwhile ambition stirs, galloping after honor and wealth.\n\nWhen the will is thus fixed,\n*qi* follows it,\nand when *qi* moves,\nthe spirit is affected.\n\nThus, inner turmoil and outer distractions ensue,\nthe spirit scatters, *qi* dissipates,\nand *Nature* and *Life* are lost.\n\nThose who seek to restore primordial *Nature* and *Life*\nmust first solidify the *qi* of later Heaven,\nand to solidify the *qi* of later Heaven,\none must first restore primordial *Nature* and *Life*.\n\nObserve the saints and immortals of past and present—\nwithout fail, they cultivated *Nature* to establish *Life*.\nThere has never been one who cultivated *Nature* without refining *Life*,\nor refined *Life* without cultivating *Nature*,\nyet clung to one side alone and succeeded.\n\nFor *Nature* is the root of *Life*,\nand *Life* is the stem of *Nature*.\nThough they differ in sequence,\ntheir practice cannot be one-sided—\nwhy do later scholars and monks\nso often lean toward *Nature* or toward *Life*,\nyet never achieve success and still fail to repent?\n\n*Nature* is the sovereign of the body,\n*Life* is its operation.\n\nIf one does not preserve essence and enrich *qi*,\nyet speaks of perfect awareness and round brightness,\nthen the body and *Life* perish—\nwhere then would *Nature* reside?\n\nIf one does not purify thoughts and seek the true,\nyet only burns elixirs and gathers herbs,\nthen the heart and *Nature* remain unseen—\n*Life* is preserved in vain.\n\nMoreover, Heaven in creating humans\nfirst establishes principle, then *qi*—\nwithout principle, it is like a tree without roots,\nhow then could it flourish?\n\nAnd in cultivating the Dao,\none must refine *Life* to perfect *Nature*—\nwithout *Life*, it is like a lamp without oil,\nhow then could it shine?\n\nIn summary, the Dao is fundamentally unified,\nand practice must be comprehensive—\nonly thus may one avoid falling into one-sidedness,\nand escape the reproach of \"excessive yang cannot thrive, lone yin cannot generate.\"\n\n**On the Reality of Essence, *Qi*, and Spirit**\n\nThe *Heart Seal Scripture* states:\nThe three supreme elixirs are spirit, *qi*, and essence.\n\nThus, the greatest medicine of the body\nis the greatest elixir of the body itself.\n\nThe scholar who refines these in sequence\nwill not fall into one-sidedness.\n\nWhen considering human birth,\nit begins with a point of original spirit\ndescending from emptiness into the embryo—\nthis is called *spirit generating qi*, *qi* generating essence.\nThus, ten months in the womb,\nthree years at the breast,\ntotaling 5,480 days,\nand only then does one complete the four great elements of the body—\nthis is the natural way of birth.\n\nBut to reverse aging, return to youth,\nand achieve true immortality,\none must refine essence into *qi*,\nrefine *qi* into spirit,\nand thus return to emptiness and unite with the Dao—\nthis is the work of alchemical transformation.\n\nIn essence, refining essence is not merely refining the essence of sexual intercourse,\nrefining *qi* is not merely refining the *qi* of breathing,\nrefining spirit is not merely refining the spirit of thought.\n\nOne must seek within the physical form\nwhere the primordial true essence originates,\nwhere the primordial true *qi* moves,\nwhere the primordial true spirit resides—\nonly then can elixir refinement succeed.\nOtherwise, it is but phantom elixir,\nhow could it endure unbroken?\n\nStill, refining essence must first refine the original essence,\nwhile not damaging the later Heaven’s sexual essence;\nrefining *qi* must first refine the original *qi*,\nwhile not injuring the later Heaven’s breathing *qi*;\nrefining spirit must first refine the original spirit,\nwhile not extinguishing the later Heaven’s thinking

The accumulated essence in the Elixir Field is moved throughout the body. After prolonged irrigation, the essence is fully transformed into *qi*, permeating the entire body—this is the work of refining essence into *qi*.\n\nWhen the essence has fully transformed into

**harmony that arises from response (感而遂通之和)****.\n\nWithout bias or contradiction,\nboth its preservation and expression\nreveal the vastness of its true nature.\n\nIn its subtle form, it is the

**clear mirror in open space (明镜当空)****:\nthe beautiful remains beautiful,\nthe ugly remains ugly,\nwhile one’s own heart holds no trace of preference.\nThus, the heart is universal yet without attachment,\nthe emotions follow all things yet remain detached—\npossessing a **measure vast enough to encompass the world (大天下莫能载)****,\nyet refined enough to **transcend its limits (小天下莫能破)****.\n\nIf not so, those who cling to partial learning,\neither fixating on stillness for cultivation\nor chasing movement for practice,\nmay gain some fleeting insight,\nbut it is as quickly lost as attained.\nHow could they ever achieve the **unification of inner and outer, equality of self and others, harmony of motion and stillness (平物我等动静人己而一)****?\n\nThis is the **sages’ work of preserving the heart and nurturing nature (圣贤存心养性)****.\nThe scholar, in moments of neither motion nor stillness,\nmust seek the **root of both motion and stillness (有动有静之根本)****,\nand hold it firmly in mind—\nextending it to the utmost in every circumstance,\nwhether in **extreme hardship or triumph (造次颠沛)****,\nwithout ever deviating.\nThen the heart and principle merge,\nprinciple and heart blend—\nbecoming one seamless whole,\nwith no distinction between inner and outer, self and others.\n\nThough it may be said,\nits attainment is no simple matter.\n\nFor I have **broadly surveyed antiquity and the present (旷观古今)****,\nand **experienced the depths of human nature (阅历人情)****,\nand found none who do not prioritize the outer over the inner.\n\nDay after day, they scheme for their

world surpasses it.\n\nEven if they know it,\ntheir understanding is but a **faint imitation (摹仿依稀)**—\nsometimes stillness is present,\nbut motion is absent;\nsometimes a thought arises,\nonly to vanish immediately.\nNone have **truly and firmly discovered the slightest trace of true reality (一点真际)**),\nas in Mencius’ words:\n*\"When dwelling in spacious halls, one practices the great Dao.\nIn

once this nature shifts at the slightest thought,\nthe myriad **hearts of profit-loss and likes-dislikes (利害好恶之心)** arise,\nand it is then **swallowed by the turbid (汩没)** and lost.\n\nHence, Confucius said:\n*\"Once again, reflection is possible.\"*\nThe shallow scholars, however, dwell in **stillness cultivation (静中之养)**,\nand though they may glimpse the **original source

**nature** has no foundation;\nwithout **nature**, **life** has no master.\nThe two are **one in two (二者是二而一也)**.\n\nIf one **discerns the source of nature and life (明得性命之源)**,\nthen all **emotional deceits (一切情伪之私)** and **flux of perception (知觉之运)**\nare but **obstacles within life (命中之障)**.\nThus, one **cultivates the postnatal qi-breathing life (后天炁息之命)**\nand returns to the **primal prenatal essence (先天元炁之命)**—\nso as not to **fall into materialism (实有)** nor **voidism (虚无)**,\nand thereby attain the **true Dao of immortality (真仙之道)**.\n\nOtherwise, one merely **nourishes the postnatal blood-and-qi life (后天血气之命)**,\nwithout knowing the **primal prenatal void-life (先天虚无之命)**.\nEven if one achieves **eternal youth (长生不老)**,\nthey are but a **guardian of the corpse (守尸之鬼)**.\nIn the end,\nthey will **wander through life and death (生生世世流浪)** in the **ocean of love and sea of desire (爱河欲海)**\nwithout any **bound or end (穷期)**.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"The **Great Unity (太和)** of

**cannot unify into one (不能合而为一)**—\nhow then could one **achieve an indestructible body (万古不坏之身)**?\n\nScholars must **recover the breath (呼吸之息)**\nto **restore the primal essence-qi (太和之元炁)**.\nThe **Dao (道)** is this:\n**Do not shake your essence (无摇尔精)**,\n**do not strain your form (无劳尔形)**,\n**do not let your thoughts labor ceaselessly (无俾尔思虑营营)**—\nthen one may **achieve eternal life (长生)**.\n\nAgain it is said:\n*\"When the **heart is unmoved (心不动)**,\nit is called **refining essence (炼精)**—\n**refining essence** brings forth **tiger’s roar and wind’s birth (虎啸风生)**;\n**When the

Days Pass the Barrier (七日过关)**—\nthen one may **return the elixir of jade-fluid (还玉液之丹)**\nand achieve the **indestructible body (不死之身)**.\n\nThen, with the **refinement of the void (炼虚一着)**,\none arrives at **stillness without motion (如如不动)**,\n**clarity without dimming (惺惺长明)**—\n**completely without trace of action (浑无半点作为之迹)**,\nyet **nothing in all things can fail to act

This is the foundational step of **cultivating the center (守中)**, the most urgent task for those who study the Dao/Way.\n\nIf one speaks of the Dao/Way from beginning to end, it is all about

      "translated_text": "Now, regarding the **Small Circulation’s** fire timing—there are **cultivated (文)** and **martial (武)** methods, with **yin-yang correspondences** and **calculable measures**, yet the **Great Circulation’s** fire transcends both attachment and emptiness. At first, it seems neither bound to existence nor void, but in time, it settles into **Great Stillness (大定)**—where the **mercury’s** nature, prone to flight, no longer disperses, and is refined into a single block of **purple-gold frost**, motionless and undisturbed. This is the **posterior elixir’s** golden essence entering the **cinnabar field (泥丸)**, where lead is drawn and mercury added to forge the **Great Elixir**—the essence of the **Great Circulation’s** method.\n\nTruly, the initial **refinement of essence into qi** lies in the **Lower Field (下田)**, where this **pre-heaven true lead** is forged. Once the **Lower Field** is full, the abdomen swells like a pregnant woman’s. Then, all this lead is extracted to supplement the mercury. When the **Great Circulation’s** work begins, one merely observes before the body, following the **leftward rotation of the breath**. With prolonged observation, the **lead’s dryness** and the **mercury’s abundance** merge, and **spirit and qi** blend harmoniously—this is the sign of **refining mercury into spirit**.\n\nWhen the practice reaches this stage,\nthe **hundred vessels** cease,\n**fetal breathing** stabilizes,\nand **immortality** is achieved—**transcendence as a human sage**.\n\nYet during the **past trials of crossing thresholds and ingestion**, when the **qi is severed like death**, if one has not **nurtured the heart-field** or **accumulated vast merit**, many are ensnared by **demonic trials** and perish. Thus, one must **discern one’s true nature**—utterly free of impurity—before undertaking this **Great Work**, to **return the elixir of jade-fluid**. This is why ancient sages rarely revealed it, fearing deceitful imitators.\n\nBut those who cultivate only the **treasure of life** without **nurturing the nature**—even if they avoid demonic assaults—remain entangled in **worldly desires**, their **lustful habits** unchecked. Like **fox spirits or serpent demons**, they harm others without restraint.\n\nIn summary, to **return the elixir of jade-fluid**, one must **understand the depletion of spirit**:\n- **Overeating** dulls the spirit,\n- **Hunger** injures it,\n- **Excessive sleep** befogs it,\n- **Restlessness** scatters it,\n- **Excessive speech** weakens it,\n- **Overthinking** disrupts it,\n- **Lust** drains it.\nAll such **harmful actions, words, and habits** must be **abandoned early**.\n\nOnly then does the **heart harbor a solitary luminous essence**:\n- **Eyes** gaze inward,\n- **Breath** is contained within,\n- **Tongue’s luster** is preserved internally,\n- **Limbs move** yet remain steady,\n- **Mind reflects** yet is pure.\nAt first, one **strives to sustain** this, but in time, it flows **effortlessly**—\n**moving yet still, still yet moving**,\n**containing the utmost in emptiness, the utmost in fullness**,\n**embracing supreme vacuity yet absolute substance**.\nOnly then is **returning the elixir** no difficulty.\n\n---\n\n**Further Refinement of the Void**\n\nPreviously, **refining qi and spirit** was **relocating the furnace and cauldron** in the **Middle Field (中田)**, to **refine the true yin of the Separated Palace (离中真阴)**—what the ancients called **meditation in the Palace of Departure (离宫修定)**.\n\nAt this stage, the **essence has fully transformed into lead**, and thus **lead refines mercury**, encasing it firmly without leakage. Lead and mercury merge into one seamless mass, eventually forming a **yang spirit** that emerges from the **Vermilion Palace (绛宫)**, ascending to the **cinnabar field (泥丸)**. Suddenly, **spirit-light radiates**, piercing the heavens, and in an instant, it **wanders through the Five Lakes, Four Seas, Nine Regions, and Ten Thousand Lands**—its marvels beyond comprehension.\n\nYet one must first **clarify the origin of the heart-mind** before refining the **treasure of life**. From the moment of **unborn existence**, one’s **true nature** is **round and luminous**, **pure and empty of all things**. Only upon entering the world does **a single thought** weave the **form and substance** of the body. Even external objects—**beautiful wives, precious jade, fine gold, or all worldly splendor**—are **illusions born of attachment**. Though they may seem real, they are **dream-like and fleeting**, unable to endure.\n\nWith such **elevated vision** and **unbounded heart**, one must regard **all phenomena as external**, even the body as a **phantom form**. Only the **midst’s eternal, still essence**—**unborn, unending, and ever-present**—is **truly oneself**.\n\nIf one remains **untouched by external defilement** and **unmixed by internal thoughts**, ever aware of the **pure, luminous, void-awakening nature**, harmonized with the **beginning and end of heaven and earth**, then—**when the ten-month embryo is complete**—a **single point of yang spirit** manifests, emerging between **heaven and earth**, free to **roam unrestrained**.\n\nBut if one has **never cultivated the nature**, and merely **refined the treasure of life** to forge a **yang spirit**, then upon its emergence, it **must be swiftly recalled**. For without **clarity of the true nature** or **severance from worldly desires**, **pleasure and fear** will disturb the mind. The **Seven Emotions and Six Desires** can **seize the spirit**, and if not **immediately withdrawn**, one risks **a demonic snare stealing the soul**—or, even without harm, **a single thought may plunge one into rebirth**, unknown whether as a **horse or ox**.\n\nTruly, one’s practice reaching this realm has **endured countless hardships**, yet without **refining the void**, **external dangers persist**—how regrettable!\n\nAt this stage, those who **never cultivated the nature** must **reforge and refine anew**, **nurturing the heart internally** and **accumulating merit externally**, firmly grasping the **original round-luminous nature**.

One must **dissolve the original spirit** that was previously cultivated, **rendering it nonexistent**, utterly unaware that **the spirit is the void**, and **the void is the spirit**.\n\nAs **Zhuāngzi** said: *\"When the butterfly transforms into a man, and the man transforms into a butterfly, he does not know whether the butterfly is the man or the man is the butterfly. This is two, this is one; blurred and indistinct, with no way to break their boundary.\"* This is the true meaning of **returning to the void**.\n\nIf one **still does not recognize** that **my spirit is the void of the Great Emptiness**, and **the void of the Great Emptiness is also my spirit**, and **spirit and void cannot yet merge as one**, then one must **not rashly release it outward**.\n\nThough all things have **forms**, only the void has **none**; though all things have **names**, only the void has **none**. Yet in truth, **the vastness of heaven and earth**, **the remoteness of the four seas**, encompasses **not a single person, thing, grass, or tree** that is not contained within the void—**this is why it is beyond conception or utterance**.\n\nFor those who **practice and refine** to this stage, they may **ascend the Dharma Seat** alongside the **Great Awakened Tathāgata** and **attain the realm of the Buddha**.\n\nWith this **realm attained** and this **cause understood**, one may **transcend the spirit from its dwelling**, **exchange form and shed the shell**, and through the **Great Return of the Golden Elixir**, **avoid demonic entanglement and spectral intrusion**.\n\nOtherwise, **since the beginning of the eon**, who has **not had ancestral grudges or past enmities** yet to be **consummated and extinguished**? If one **has not clearly awakened**, **risen above the dusty world**, or **penetrated the gate of life and death**, then **demons will not cease to haunt**, or one may **be reborn as a woman**, or **take on a malevolent and fierce appearance**, or **manifest as palaces, halls, gold, jade, silks, and brocades**, or **all manner of fame, wealth, and noble titles**—**even gods, immortals, and celestial armies**. At this moment, those who **have not yet realized the true nature** will **rarely fail to have their spirit stolen, their soul taken away by others**. This is why **refining the void** is **an indispensable step for cultivators**.\n\nThough so, **if one merely sits in stillness daily**, **ignoring worldly affairs**, and **indifferent to the cares of life**, one **still cannot fulfill the inherent nature**, let alone **attain the boundless realm**.

This **cannot be constrained by the order of the method**.\n\nThose who **can attain such mastery**—**immortals and sages**—are **sparse indeed throughout history**. What then of **ordinary mortals** who **can fully refine their essence and qi**, **penetrate their nature**, and **directly reach the supreme nirvana**? I **would not begrudge such individuals**, but **since the Three Dynasties onward**, those who **achieve this selection** are **exceedingly rare**.\n\nIn sum: **there is no subtle without coarse**, **no nonexistence without existence**. When **divided**, there are **three categories**; when **unified**, they are **the primordial true yang of the preheaven**. **Refining essence into qi** is **not about acquiring a separate essence or a separate qi**; it is **about reclaiming the innate essence and original qi** that have been **lost in the fields of sound, color, wealth, and desire**. **Gathering and returning them to the elixir field**, one **restores the true body of youth**—though this **still belongs to the postheaven true yang**, **far from comparing** to the **preheaven one qi**, which **has no outer boundary, no inner limit, no accumulation in entering, no dispersion in exiting**.\n\n**The Dao of the Great Return**",

      "translated_text": "**Thus, one must further advance with assiduous practice and the power of cultivation, refining this formed and colored embryo into the marvel of divine transformation—where neither *qi* nor spirit is known. One returns to the primordial void of preheaven *yuan-qi*, unseen when viewed, unheard when listened to, untouchable when grasped. If one regards it as *non-existence*, then movement and spirit follow naturally, filling the cosmos without interruption. If one regards it as *not non-existence*, then at the utmost stillness and depth, not a thread or grain can be perceived.\n\nWhen practice reaches this stage, it returns from the *Taiji*’s root to the *Wuji*’s true essence. Otherwise, if one clings only to postheaven *jing-qi*, unaware of preheaven divine transformation, one will inevitably fall into empty seated meditation, a withered *chan*. If one speaks only of preheaven divine transformation without cultivating postheaven *jing-qi*, one will end in reckless emptiness. Knowing the unity of *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life) in dual cultivation, yet leaping stages—prioritizing what should come later and vice versa—one risks chaos without order, confusion without sequence. Even if one enters the Dao, one will not avoid falling into one extreme or the other, unable to stand in the middle path and ascend to the gates of immortality and sagehood.\n\nI now transmit this essential teaching not in haste or recklessness, but because false paths proliferate and heretical doctrines multiply. They divide the Dao into sects, each clinging to a single interpretation, slandering our path. Reluctantly compelled, I was urged to compile this *Essentials of the Dao Gate* as a bridge for future generations. May those with resolve in this Way discern my earnest intent.\n\n**Clarifying the Practice of Self-Cultivation**\nThe terms *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life) are two in name but one in essence—our Dao calls it *double cultivation*.\n\nFor instance, in the *Guard the Center* practice, though one speaks of gathering scattered *qi* back to the *dantian* to refine preheaven true yang, without dispelling wandering thoughts and eliminating delusions, sweeping away all dusty entanglements, how could one return to the root breath by breath or enter samadhi at all times? Again, when true yang arises, one extracts the true lead from the *kan* vessel to refine the yin mercury of *li*, performing the *zi-wu* ascending-descending function and applying the *washing-bathing-nourishing* method to refine oneself and establish the foundation. Without purifying the mind, washing the heart, abandoning emotions, severing desires, restraining anger, and eliminating deceit to preserve sincerity, how could one balance water and fire, harmonize yin and yang, and form the millet-grain elixir to nurture the embryo? This is cultivating *ming*, yet cultivating *xing* is also inherent within it.\n\nWhen the *playing female* and *playing male* conceive, the elixir takes form, and at the hundred-day foundation stage, one must perform the *Great Circulation*. At this point, one must only preserve the spirit and discard thoughts, reduce desires and clarify the heart, to temper and refine the supreme yellow treasure. Without employing the *wuwei* divine fire and the *youzuo* true mechanism—ascending, descending, simmering, and refining—one cannot forge the yang spirit to burst through the celestial gate.\n\nOnce the yang spirit emerges and the great elixir returns, one must use the divine crucible and divine furnace, true fire and true medicine, refining in the *nirvana marrow palace*. If one merely speaks of utmost stillness and *wuwei*, waiting passively for it to spontaneously ascend to the ninth heaven, even the innate sages may fail to achieve emptiness and yet ascend on cranes to immortality.\n\nThough this is cultivating *xing*, cultivating *ming* is also within it.\n\nIn summary: *xing* is the original preheaven spirit, *ming* is the preheaven *yuan-qi*. Their origin lies in Heaven, their substance is complete within oneself. Though they may be divided for beginners’ understanding, fundamentally, divided they are two, united they are one. Those unclear on this Dao who cultivate only one path are not following the *Zhongyong* Way but stray into false doctrines.\n\nSome say the *Guard the Center* method has been fully explained—one center within the body, one not within the body. The subtle teachings passed from Yao, Shun, and Yu simply state: *\"Hold fast to the Center.\"* The Center is the beginning and end of cultivation; those who practice the Dao their entire lives cannot exhaust it, yet its clarity is already within sight. But as for the *Small* and *Great Circulations* you speak of—how exactly do they differ?\n\nI say: The *Small Circulation* is the stage of *kan-li* union, when external medicine is produced. Within a day’s twelve hours, whenever yang arises, one may perform it. The Pure Yang Ancestor says:\n*\"When the first yang stirs, the midnight water clock lingers,\nThe warm crucible glows—light pierces the curtains.\"*\n\nThis is when essence generates medicine; one should perform the *Small River-Car* practice. If not yet ready, one must not act recklessly and invite disaster.\n\nThe *Great Circulation* is when internal medicine forms and the embryo manifests—when yin and yang unite, a single point settles in the *Huangting*. Here, one must only remain in *non-duality*, neither clinging nor rejecting, employing a continuous, subtle spirit to perform the unceasing, uninterrupted function. Not a moment’s pause in a day and night. Guangchengzi says:\n*\"The elixir furnace and River-Car rest without haste,\nThe crane embryo and tortoise breath flow endlessly.\"*\n\nZhang Xian says:\n*\"All day long, drunkenly dazed,\nOnly guarding the cave’s eternal spring.\"*\n\nThus, the functions of the *Small* and *Great Circulations* differ.\n\nFrom this, one knows: it begins with *youzuo* (action) and ends with *wuwei* (non-action). When *wuwei* becomes *wuwei* yet *wu* (nothing) does not prevent *wei* (action), then the Dao is attained.\n\nThe student must first master the practice of self-refinement before performing this *wuwei* function, lest grave danger arise. If refinement is not yet complete, the peril is incalculable.",

      "translated_text": "The first principle is to distinguish the fire and medicine clearly—fire must be precise in its timing, and the medicines must be known with certainty. One must not be negligent nor reckless, nor too slow nor too hasty, but especially diligent in cultivating virtue and accumulating good deeds, so as to move Heaven and the Divine to descend their favor, and to transform the malevolent forces of demons and obstacles into submission. Only then may one hope to achieve lasting attainment, where one success endures forever, and one danger never recurs.\n\nThis is the source of life and vitality, the Dao of dual cultivation. Yet already it has been written plainly and distinctly, yet later students still cling to one-sided views—some cultivating vitality without nurturing life, others nurturing life without cultivating vitality, each defending their own doctrine while disparaging others. Truly, this is the root of no hope for transcendence!\n\nAs for the functions of the Small and Great Circulations, internal and external medicines, and internal and external fires, I have briefly outlined their general principles. The scholar who reflects deeply upon these may truly comprehend their unchanging conditions.\n\nFrom ancient times, the great sages like Zhang and Lü accumulated sincerity and moved the Divine, striving thus to the second or third level before fully mastering the life-nurturing function. Yet in the cultivation of vitality, these two sages once gazed heavenward and sighed deeply, repeatedly and without pause, before receiving the transmission of the Dao and attaining true transcendence. How fortunate are later students to obtain this genuine instruction! Should they not strive earnestly?\n\n**The Functions of Fire and Medicine**\n\nBefore attaining the elixir, the most difficult aspect is mastering the external fire. Once the elixir is obtained, the most difficult aspect becomes mastering the internal fire.\n\nWhat is the external fire? It is the breath of one’s own inhalation and exhalation. What is the internal fire? It is the subtle, natural breath that arises when one adjusts and refines the inhalation and exhalation—an essence that is both present and absent.\n\nEssentially, the external breath, though appearing as something, must ultimately return to nothingness. The internal essence-breath, though seemingly nothing, must not be grasped as something. If one forcibly clings to nothingness while seeking something, not only will the internal essence-breath fail to manifest, but even the external breath will become unrefined.\n\nThe *Mirror of Medicine* states: *\"Heaven responds with stars, Earth with tides—this is the external fire.\"* Master Ziyang says: *\"The true fire of Heaven is naturally present; no need for fuel or forced breathing—this is the internal fire.\"*\n\nKnow that though fire has two forms, their ultimate essence is one: a continuous, subtle *qi* that is soft yet dense, fine yet profound.\n\nLaozi says: *\"Soft and continuous, like something ever-present—yet its use is not forced.\"*\n\nMaster Cui says: *\"The *qi* of Primordial Heaven, the *qi* of Postnatal Heaven—those who attain it seem perpetually drunk.\"*\n\nFrom this reflection, one knows that the two breaths—external and internal—are but one continuous, subtle *qi*.\n\nIf the scholar truly grasps this rhythm, circulating it through every joint and node of the body, the *qi* will flow vast and unceasing, without pause or interruption. The entire body will feel supple as silk, refreshingly invigorated—only to see it surging like waves, dense yet fine, rising naturally and descending effortlessly, opening and closing in perfect harmony, moving and returning in accordance with Heaven’s unfailing course.\n\nWhen the student possesses this true Yang fire, even long-standing stubborn illnesses—whether in the limbs or organs—will dissolve under its pressure, turning into sweat that emerges through every pore of the body. If some illnesses remain untransformed, it is merely because the fire’s power is still weak, and the true Yang *qi* has not yet been obtained.\n\nFor Yang is vigor, is strength—its nature is inherently dynamic. Illnesses in the body often arise from Yang weakness and Yin excess, congealing into deep-seated, chronic afflictions. Yet once the true fire’s condition is attained, it is like winter snow, firm and unyielding, but when spring’s warmth arrives, even the longest-frozen ice cannot resist melting under the sun’s rays. So too, the body’s illnesses, which are nothing but congealed Yin *qi*, must dissolve under the influence of this true Yang *qi*.\n\nThus, the Dao’s ability to dispel illness is not due to any special method—it is merely the attainment of Heaven and Earth’s true Yang *qi*.\n\nAs for medicines, there are several types. Initially, one refines coarse breath into the Primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth, gathering it in the elixir field. With time, true transformation arises—this is the external fire refining the innate Primordial *qi*, which the ancients called *\"the mother of the child\"* (i.e., the true gold born from water).\n\nOne must know: Heaven and Earth’s Dao is simply Naturalness. How much more so when refining the elixir adheres to the patterns of the Primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth! There is no Dao that does not follow Naturalness while still relying on human effort.\n\nAfter the union of Heaven and Earth, a point of Primordial Yang falls into the Yin, changing into *Kàn* (Abyss). Kàn water is cold by nature—without the radiance of the Divine descending upon it, it congeals into harsh Yin, and neither water rises nor gold emerges. But when the Yang fire presses upon it, naturally the fire steams and the water boils, and the true gold floats upward. The Primordial Yang gold, hidden within the water, refined by the true fire, returns to the state of Non-Extremity, growing ever clearer with each refinement—this is called *true gold*, the innate elixir of the body. Yet after birth, desires and thoughts muddy it, and a veil of malevolent Yin *qi* obscures the gold, just as animal charcoal placed in an icy cellar is congealed by cold, and the Yang cannot emerge alone. Now, with the true fire’s scorching, suddenly the Primordial gold returns from the Abyss—thus the Dao calls it *external medicine*, though it is inherently one’s own.\n\nFrom this manifestation of Yang, one must not let it rise and sink at will, flying beyond control. Nor should it be wasted in daily actions, merely to display one’s cleverness and brilliance. Instead, one must learn the sages’ method of the River-Car’s ascent and descent, guiding this true lead upward into the *Lí* (Clarity) palace, to refine the Yin mercury within it. Thus, Yin and Yang harmonize as one family, merging into unity, neither flying nor straying. With prolonged practice, the Yin of Clarity transforms naturally, and the true Yang is born—this is the *internal medicine*.",

      "translated_text": "「Yet, why must the Yin within *Lí* (Clarity) await the true Yang from *Kǎn* (Abyss)? Indeed, *Lí* belongs to Fire; without the Water of *Kǎn*, its *qi* grows faint and languid, erupting as the Seven Emotions and Six Desires, giving rise to inexplicable eccentricities and monstrosities. Even without such monstrosities, without Water to temper Fire, it will daily and nightly surge uncontrollably outward, unable to be gathered or restrained—like Water and Fire dwelling together, bound to consume utterly before ceasing.\n\nThus, the reason mortals fail to attain longevity is that their *shén* (spirit) and *qì* (vital essence) are ever dispersing, with no true Water to subdue them. Hence, they burn out and die. If one practices this alchemy, initially one uses the spirit-fire to illuminate downward, refining the gold from within *Kǎn*. Then, with the gold and water united, one subdues the Fire of *Lí*—so the *external medicine* is born from the union of *Kǎn* and *Lí*, while the *internal medicine* is nurtured by the harmonization of Yin and Yang. In truth, all is Yang seeking Yin and Yin seeking Yang, forged through their mutual configuration—thus the matter of human transcendence is complete.\n\nFrom this, one must again place this Yang spirit back into the crucible and furnace, re-establishing the *Buǎn* (Crucible) and *Kǎn* (Abyss), using the harmonized Yin-Yang spirit to ascend once more into the *Níwán* (Cinnabar) palace, refining an indestructible golden body. This is no separate Dao; it is the spirit of Yin-Yang union, wholly drawn from the physical form. Yet it remains entangled with grossness and heaviness, unable to soar through the skies or traverse lightning, to ride the mist or harness the clouds, to dwell in the void of empty space without decay. Therefore, one must further elevate this Yang spirit—now embodied—into the realm of *Qīngxū* (Empty Clarity), within the singular aperture of the void above. Thus, with breath that is without breath, and spirit that is without spirit, one refines from the embodied to the formless, from the conditioned to the unconditioned—this is the moment of the great elixir’s Fire refining and medicinal maturity. In essence, it is the pure Yang of Empty Clarity uniting with the Yin-Yang of the singular aperture.\n\nWhen this great work is achieved, it is merely the Primordial *yuánqì* (Original Vital Essence) of Nature itself—ultimately, what is there and what is not? I reiterate: let it be purely the task of following Nature.\n\nFor mortals seeking this path, one must first understand the origin of cultivation and refinement, lest one blindly practice and recklessly act, inviting misfortune. This is why ancient Daoist masters were reluctant to reveal it—now I disclose it for all under Heaven and for future generations. May it be cherished and treasured.\n\n**Discourse on Early Human Cultivation**\nAncients first established their foundation by mastering the *tuóluò* (Hollow Bell), meaning the gathering of spirit and the concentration of *qì*.\n\nIndeed, without gathering the spirit, it becomes chaotic; without concentrating the *qì*, it disperses. Spirit is the master of *qì*, and *qì* is the auxiliary of spirit. If one does not first gather the spirit, the *qì* will float and drift externally, unable to condense within the body—it will inevitably scatter and diminish daily, with sickness and death arising thereafter. How then could one nurture the elixir within and achieve transcendence?\n\nThe ancients said: *\"When the spirit returns, the qì naturally submits.\"* This is the indispensable principle for cultivators.\n\nAs for the crucible and furnace, they are but this physical form itself. The lute and sword are but the embodiment of discarding desire and preserving principle. The *Xuānmǔ* (Mysterious Mother) is but the recognition of the true mechanism in motion. The *Shǒuchéng* (Guarding the City) is but the understanding of medicinal refinement within prescribed boundaries, using Fire to temper and nourish. The *Yězhàn* (Wild Battle) is but the initial extraction of the medicinal Fire. Though their names vary, all are metaphorical analogies concealing the profound mysteries of the Dao. If scholars diligently follow these without slackening, their cultivation will be without error. Though they may not ascend to the ranks of the Golden Immortals, they can still repel illness, extend their years, and forever enjoy the blessings of human prosperity and longevity.\n\nIn sum, one can never depart from the essential step of refining the heart, nor from the indispensable accumulation of merit and cause-and-effect.\n\nFor those who enter this gate, fortunate to hear the true instructions, they must not stray into false paths or external doctrines. How many lifetimes of diligent cultivation of Yin and Yang, how vast the accumulation of Daoist karmic connections, before one encounters this today? Otherwise, they would never meet it, and even if they did, they would pass it by in error. Moreover, their doubt and faith would be mixed, unable to generate unwavering conviction and resolve.\n\nSince one has encountered this Daoist fate, the first imperative is not to treat it lightly. Cultivate diligently, and forge this Fire into completion, lest one abandon the crucible and start anew. If one encounters it yet does not cultivate, or cultivates yet without diligence, I fear that good karmic fate will vanish while malevolent connections arise—before one can even realize it, such opportunities may never return again.\n\nMoreover, the times are not those of a great *jiè* (calamity/eon). The age of five hundred years, where the worthy rise and the upright live, has not yet arrived. Though one may have cultivated great virtue and gathered Daoist connections in many lives, if the time is not yet ripe, the Immortals and Saints will not descend, and one will still not hear this great Dao.\n\nNow, having been born in this time and heard its teachings, fortunate to dwell in an era of peace, the blessings bestowed are already great—bestowed by Heaven. At this juncture, if one does not exert every effort to achieve it, when else shall one await?\n\nFor merit and virtue vary in magnitude, so too does the attainment of transcendence differ in rank. It cannot be uniform.\n\nFor instance, refining *jīng* (Essence) into *qì* (Vital Essence) to repel illness, extend life, and achieve human transcendence; refining *qì* into *shén* (Spirit) to return to the Original and reclaim one’s destiny, attaining Earthly transcendence; refining *shén* to return to the void, or attuning the spirit to emerge from the shell, achieving Heavenly transcendence. Though transcendence has many grades, all depend on the Heavenly Deities assessing one’s merit and granting rewards—none can be achieved solely by one’s own cultivation efforts.\n\nNext, even in one’s lifetime, if the spirit is concentrated with unwavering resolve, after death one becomes the sovereign of the *língtán* (Spiritual Altar). If one is wise, upright, compassionate, and benevolent in life, after death one becomes the guardian deity of the land and its harvests. Again, if one greatly cultivates merit and widely sows fields of virtue—whether by sacrificing one’s body in peril or saving the people of the realm—though one may not become a deity, in future lives one will surely be reborn as an emperor or king. Or if one honors the lonely and aids the widowed, respects the aged and pities the poor, in future lives one will become a wealthy household patriarch. If one resolves conflicts, donates resources to build benevolent acts, in future lives one may become a noble’s son. Such varied good causes all bear their own fruits—one reaps what one sows. The Heavenly Deities merely grant rewards according to what one cultivates; it is not the power of *Yánluó* (Underworld Deities) to create destiny for mortals.»",
      "overlap_context": " control. Nor should it be wasted in daily actions, merely to display one’s cleverness and brilliance. Instead, one must learn the sages’ method of the River-Car’s ascent and descent, guiding this true lead upward into the *Lí* (Clarity) palace, to refine the Yin mercury within it. Thus, Yin and Yang harmonize as one family, merging into unity, neither flying nor straying. With prolonged practice, the Yin of Clarity transforms naturally, and the true Yang is born—this is the *internal medicine*.",

      "translated_text": "The scholar I exhort: if one has not heard the Dao, let it be. But once one has heard it, one must pursue it to its utmost without ceasing. If there arises a sluggish or weary heart, let one reflect: *\"Now that I have fortunately encountered the transmission of the Immortals, if this body is not transcended in this life, then in what life shall it be?\"* Moreover, favorable moments do not recur, and joyous affairs are not constant. One may fear that after this time, there will be no more auspicious occasions or fortunate gatherings. If one does not urgently cultivate and practice, one may fear that after this moment, a thousand kalpas may pass before another chance arises, drifting aimlessly in the tumultuous, rolling world. To then turn one’s fate and break free would be most difficult indeed.\n\nWhen one awakens thus with such vigor, one’s spirit naturally clears and one’s *qi* grows robust. There will be no lack of energy in one’s practice. One must always maintain an awakened, illuminating mind and the power of sudden realization, holding fast to it without losing it. Then, those with sincere hearts will not be abandoned by Heaven, and those with resolve will achieve their aims.\n\nAs for the subtle and secret aspects, though not all have been fully revealed, the difference lies only in minor details. If one internally cultivates essence and life, and externally accumulates virtue and merit without slackening in resolve, the Heavenly Deities will surely guide and bestow their favor. For human whispers are heard by Heaven like thunder, and hidden misdeeds are seen by the Divine like lightning. How could those who diligently practice the Dao fail to have their every thought and intention known to the Heavenly Deities, who hold them in special affection?\n\nOne need not fear that the true transmission of the Dao is unattainable—only that having received it, one fails to exert oneself in applying it. Let future scholars heed my words and strive accordingly.\n\n**Teachings to the Disciples on Seated Meditation and Stillness**\n\nYou disciples have recently practiced seated meditation and stillness, refining the methods of ascent and descent, yet have not yet reached the proper state. Though ascent and descent are coarse practices, they too have their methods. If one ascends too high, the spirit and *qi* will inevitably scatter; if one descends too low, one risks falling into torpor and drowsiness. If one does not know that prolonged ascent must be followed by descent, and that extreme descent must be followed by ascent, then remaining too high invites the onset of fire and disease, while remaining too low invites the *qi* to be driven downward and dissipated. The harm from this is beyond measure.\n\nEven in a single inhalation and exhalation, there is ascent and descent. At first, one directs the mind to descend into the *dāntián* (elixir field), then guides it upward from the *wěilú* (tailbone aperture) to the *níwán* (brain’s marrow palace), and finally descends it into the *tǔfū* (earth furnace). This single inhalation and exhalation encompasses ascent and descent. Even the three hundred and sixty revolutions of the *lúnché* (circular orbit) and the application of the *héchē* (river vehicle) method adhere to this principle.\n\nAt first, the essence sinks into the Water Palace, submerged and unmoving, and one must resort to violent fire to force it upward. Yet when it ascends, one must not overuse the mind—it must rise lightly and subtly, as if with intention yet without intention, as Mencius said: *\"Do not forget, yet do not assist.\"* When the spirit and *qi* ascend, one’s vision transcends the world, and one’s measure encompasses Heaven and Earth. This is the Dao’s spring and summer—flourishing and nurturing all things. At this stage, one must not force further ascent, for doing so would disperse the spirit and *qi* without return, exhausting them until they are spent. Thus, the Daoists have the method of descent, which is also concealment: *\"Hide the heart in the abyss, merge the *qi* in the void,\"* drawing all the senses—eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind—into the profoundest orifice. This is the Dao’s autumn and winter—retreat, concealment, returning to the root, and restoring life.\n\nIf one conceals in this manner for a long time, whether asleep or awake, one must know that while the body sleeps, the mind does not. Only then can one avoid torpor and dissipation. This is what Confucius meant by *\"sleeping without rigidity\"*—not merely drawing up the feet and contracting the head to resemble a corpse, as the world mistakenly supposes. Ordinary people, when asleep, are like the dead, unresponsive even to calls. But the adept sleeps in body yet remains awake in spirit; the *qi* is still, yet the mind is ever-alert. If there is no sound, it is as if nothing exists, but at the slightest disturbance, one is instantly and vividly aware. This is the Dao’s method of sleep.\n\nDisciples, can you attain this state even in sleep? If not, do not seek other signs elsewhere. Simply recall how, when faced with urgent matters, though asleep, your mind could not be put down—so that even the slightest touch would awaken you. With this realization, you will naturally understand the method of sleeping in body yet remaining awake in spirit.\n\nIn essence, it is a matter of rousing the spirit and sharply awakening it, never allowing even a single thought to slacken. Yet this is but a provisional method for those who have not yet attained a sudden awakening. Once the mind’s subtleties are mastered, such rigid adherence is no longer necessary.\n\nWhen this mind is concealed in the obscure and void, over time, the natural emergence of *yáng* (the creative force) will inevitably arise. If there is no place of return, how could there be the birth of true *yáng*? Even if there appears to be, it is but an illusion, not the genuine birth of *yáng*.\n\nIt is said that the deeper the concealment, the more profound the attainment. Since your true *yáng* is not yet full, do not focus solely on the generation of *yáng-qi*. You must first engage in this quiet nourishment. Only when essence is abundant and *qi* is strong will true *yáng* naturally emerge with irresistible force. Otherwise, without the autumn-winter concealment, how could there be spring-summer flourishing?\n\nIn short, the method of ascent and descent is evident in the four seasons of a year, or in the single day and night of Heaven. Know that even in a single breath, there is ascent and descent, and in every revolution of the *zhōutiān* (circular orbit), there is ascent and descent. Let the diligent scholar discern these subtle shifts within oneself—whether ascent or descent is called for—and never err by even a hair’s breadth. Only then will there be no suffering from fire-heat or water-coldness.\n\nWhen the time for concealment arrives, there will be the gathering of the three flowers at the crown, the five *qi* paying homage to the primal, the harmonization of the five phases, and the clustering of the four symbols. If one has not reached this stage, then the upper and lower will be disconnected—*lì* (fire) above and *kǎn* (water) below—uncoordinated, like the liver and lungs, which do not communicate. When you sit in meditation, the external *qi* is unregulated, the internal *qi* is restless, the ascending *qi* does not descend, and the descending *qi* does not ascend—this is the state of *lì* and *kǎn* not interacting. The *qi* on either side of the *dāntián* moves like two doors opening and closing—one collision, then another, then parting again—this is the state of the Dragon and Tiger not uniting.",

If even one aspect fails to gather, there will be deficiencies—such as missing ears, noses, or having only one foot or hand—which arise from the parents' union when one place does not coalesce.\n\nTo cultivate the great elixir and manifest countless myriad forms, one must first gather essence and refine spirit, encompassing the primal *qi* of the body within the mysterious void of a single orifice. Then, the elixir will naturally form without seeking it. Know well that the Dao has its fixed principles, but the methods are not rigid. Just as scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants each pursue their own craft, all can nourish the body and sustain the family without being confined to a single path. Only the inherent nature of Heaven and the conscience of humanity are the fundamental roots of our existence, a fixed good that no person can lack. If one does not seek it within but instead demands it from without, striving to make a farmer like a scholar or a scholar like a merchant, it will be impossible to achieve harmony.\n\nHaving understood this, you must see that the holy teachings of the three religions each have their own methods, yet all return to the one Dao. Otherwise, clinging to one as correct while rejecting another as false, there will be endless contention and conflict. If you truly grasp this, even the lesser practices of peripheral schools will hold no ill will for you. Yet, your flawed and leaky bodies must first engage in the study of preserving and creating life, fortifying your spirit and essence before you can attain the great wisdom to illuminate the Dao, the great spirit to bear the Dao, and the great strength to support it. The foundation for ascending from lower learning to higher enlightenment must be clearly understood within yourself, grasping its truth so as not to be deceived by others.\n\nNow, the hearts of people are daily corrupted, and the customs of the world grow increasingly perverse, all because the great Dao is not clearly understood. To reverse the decline of the world and rectify human hearts, one must first make the Dao clear and plain, speaking it directly, so that the muddled world may transform into one of pure and virtuous customs.\n\nThough the writings of immortals and Buddhas are numerous, those who truly point out the original source and penetrate the essence of life and nature are few indeed. Is this because the immortals and sages do not care for the root but chase after the branches? Rather, it is because the world and its people are deeply entrenched in delusion and mired in ignorance. Even if you speak of lower learning, it still feels distant and unpalatable—how much more so the highest, supreme teachings of the Dao! Only you can comprehend the shared origin of the three religions and the unity of inner and outer, so I, as your teacher, have been commanded to reveal these profound truths to the world.\n\nThis initial practice is merely the study of preserving life, not yet the attainment of mastering nature. Yet know that our Dao practices both nature and life together—though called refining life, nature is inherent within it. If one refines life without nature, then where does the primordial elixir come from?\n\nMy disciples are many, but only you can truly understand the source of nature and the root of life and the Dao. You must begin with solid, grounded practice rather than empty speculation. Beyond you, some only know how to refine life but not nature, while others know how to refine nature but not life. These are all one-sided; what use do they have for the central Dao?\n\nExhort the disciples: To become a person of the highest order, you must do the highest deeds. To do the highest deeds, you must first harbor the highest heart and establish the highest aspiration. In all matters of daily sustenance—food, drink, clothing, and shelter—you must rise above the common crowd, not consorting with the mediocre. Otherwise, though your heart aspires to the Dao of immortals and sages, your actions and behavior remain no different from ordinary mortals. Do not speak of knowing the marvels—even if you do, it is mere empty words, offering no benefit to body or mind.\n\nConsider further: Those who study the Dao of immortality are meant to transcend humanity and enter sainthood. Ask yourself: How do I transcend the common? How do I enter the sacred? This shows that the practitioner of the Dao, though not stepping outside the principles of Heaven and human nature, must reject what the crowd loves, shun what the crowd hates, avoid what the crowd does, and embrace what the crowd avoids. Only by reflecting thus in every matter, standing apart from the vulgar, can one become an extraordinary gentleman.\n\nIf you merely admire the teachings of the sages in your heart but do not share their aspiration or follow their path, if you daily engage with the world in its noise and distractions, even if you attain fire and elixir, it will be no more than the phantom transformations of a spirit with five senses. You will be but a spectral ghost of limited power—how much less can you hope to transcend the world and enter the realm of the immortal sages! Even if you do not turn from the vulgar ways of the crowd and enter the sacred halls, the elixir you refine will not be true elixir, and the fire you cultivate will not be true fire. Without true fire and true elixir, even the formation of ordinary elixir to ward off illness and prolong life is impossible. How much more so the hope of rising above the world and becoming a transcendent immortal?",

      "translated_text": "The living must first cultivate this resolve with unwavering effort. Above all, they must begin with patience and forbearance—what others cannot endure, I must endure; what others do not yield, I must yield. Thus, they cast off worldly attachments and summon the relentless resolve to press forward with single-minded devotion to the Dao of Benevolence. Fearless of hardship and peril, they must strive with all their might to cross over, only then breaking free from the prison of sorrow and escaping the sea of suffering. Otherwise, though they turn their hearts toward the Way and yearn for the transcendent, they remain like one foot still mired in the sea of suffering while the other stands on the distant shore—forever wavering, never reaching the state of serene and spontaneous enlightenment.\n\nI exhort you: if you do not know the Great Dao, let it be. But if you know it, then act with all your strength. If you do not understand worldly desires, let them be. But if you understand them, then cast them aside completely—do not linger with hesitation, lest you obstruct your own cultivation and impede your path.\n\nHow much more so when one pursues both reason and desire in parallel—delighted by the Dao when seen within, yet equally enticed by the world’s splendor when seen without—unable to sever with decisive resolve? How could true essence and true elixir ever arise from such division?\n\nWhen one’s years advance and vital essence and blood dwindle, suddenly seeking elixir is beyond one’s power. Instead, they must adhere to the Method of Nourishing the Center. Once the Center is long preserved, the primordial yang stirs faintly—this is the birth of essence. At this stage, one need not yet employ the Circulation of the Microcosmic Orbit; merely elevate and withdraw to recover the essence in the Middle Palace. When the yang contracts like that of a child, this is sufficient. If one invokes the fire of the Microcosmic Orbit, the elixir will be weak while the fire rages strong, causing the elixir to dissipate along with the fire. Moreover, improper fire use invites countless ailments.\n\nYet when essence first emerges, it is still indistinct, like a child unaware of male and female—suddenly it solidifies, and this is true essence. If even a trace of lustful thought intrudes, the water source becomes impure and unusable.\n\nMoreover, when essence first forms, its *qi* remains faint—only a warmth, with no true essence yet. If one allows the external yang to surge uncontrollably, and either ignores its collection or fails to gather it, in an instant the *qi* will transform into essence and flow outward through the familiar path. Thus, at the outset, to nurture the rising yang and lengthen wisdom, one must first accumulate essence and gather *qi*—for every fraction of essence obtained, a fraction of *qi* is likewise gathered. Over time, as essence and *qi* fill, the symbol of the Return of Primordial Yang appears.\n\nThough *qi* grows, it is not the *qi* of ordinary breathing, but the *qi* of the Primordial Essence. Primordial Essence is formless, while breathing is formed—formless essence must borrow from the formed to manifest. The initial breathing seems both present and absent, subtle and soundless, entering and exiting without trace.\n\nIf external breathing remains coarse and unrefined, lacking harmony, the Primordial Essence will be disrupted by it, unable to govern itself. As it rises and falls, it will dissipate throughout the body’s blood and flesh, making it impossible to condense into elixir or complete the alchemical work.\n\nAs for fire, there is the fire of breathing, the fire of Primordial Essence, and the fire of Primordial Spirit. The fire of breathing transforms the *qi* of grain and essence into Primordial Essence. The fire of Primordial Essence transforms the breath of breathing into Primordial Spirit. The fire of Primordial Spirit refines the fire of Primordial Essence into the Great Elixir.\n\nAt first, the use of fire is merely to regulate the breath. Once the breath is harmonized, the Primordial Essence naturally appears. One must discern these transformations clearly and precisely—never yielding to impulsive haste. Impatience damages the Primordial Essence, which is why the ancients taught that when first embarking on practice, one must regard worldly distractions as empty, never engaging in debate with them. Having seen through worldly toil, one must not rely on cleverness or force. As for all unrighteous deeds, they are beyond consideration.\n\nAbove all, one must avoid sluggishness—sluggishness prevents the Primordial Essence from coalescing. How then could elixir or elixirization ever arise? Hence the saying: *\"Only the precise and singular may steadfastly hold the Center.\"*\n\nThe fire of Primordial Essence is both the yin-fire of the *Li* (Tricity) and the yang-fire of the *Kàn* (Water). When first initiating practice, one directs the gaze downward to the elixir field—this is the yin-fire of *Li*. At this stage, one must neither cling nor reject, forgetting yet aiding, in accordance with the Way of Nature. If the pace is too hasty or too slow, the gold in water cannot be forced forth. Later, when the gold in water is driven out by the yin-fire of *Li*, the external yang stirs, and the elixir field grows warm. Now the yang-fire of *Kàn* emerges to act—but this fire is impulsive. The practitioner must vigilantly restrain it, lest in an instant it transforms into post-heaven lust and flows outward through the familiar path. This must be guarded against above all.\n\nIn summary, fire has both gentle and fierce forms, both bathing and nourishing. First, one must use fire without appearing to use it—this is the true attainment. The practitioner must refine external breathing while quietly observing the inner transformations, only then returning the elixir and completing the Great Work.\n\nYet why observe the true breath within? When external breathing exhales, the internal Primordial Essence descends in absorption. When external breathing inhales, the internal Primordial Essence ascends in exhalation. These subtleties are known only to enlightened teachers and those who have penetrated the Dao’s mysteries.",
