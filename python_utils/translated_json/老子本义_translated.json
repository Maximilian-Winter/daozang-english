  "full_translation": "**On Laozi**\n\n**I.**\nWas the learning of Wen, Jing, and Cao Shen truly deeper than that of Ji, Ruan, Wang, or He? Yet in the Western Han and Western Jin, the people of Yan and Yue took Zhuangzi for Laozi, while the Han took Laozi for Laozi. Was this true only of Zhuangzi? From Han Fei downward, a thousand schools have offered interpretations of *Laozi*. Laozi himself is no longer alive—who can settle the matter? Each clings to a single phrase and obstructs the meaning of the *Five Thousand Words*. They take and give, open and close—what does this have to do with non-action and purity? They treat the myriad things as straw dogs—what does this have to do with compassion, salvation, and protection? They speak of the Mysterious Female and long life—what does this have to do with putting the self last and setting the body aside? Fixating on one part and slandering the whole, the *Five Thousand Words* become like ears, eyes, mouth, and nose, each unable to communicate with the others.\n\nWithout grasping the *Dao* as the root of words or the lord of affairs, they merely chase echoes and shadows at the periphery. How could such a *Dao*—easy to know, easy to practice—remain unknown and unpracticed to this day, leaving the world in confusion? Laozi said: *\"Existence is for benefit; non-existence is for function.\"* He was not unaware that existence and non-existence cannot be separated. Yet while the world understands the benefit of existence, it does not comprehend the function of non-existence. Thus, he constantly pointed to the nameless and concealed function in the unseen. Reducing again and again, he arrived at non-action. The *Dao* of non-action must begin with the absence of desire.\n\nThe various masters, unable to eliminate desire, merely admired non-action. Thus, their yin-like stillness and endurance only deepened their mechanisms and fulfilled their desires. Zhuang Zhou was free of desire, yet he did not understand the suppleness of its function. Liezi attained suppleness, yet he did not grasp that non-existence cannot be separated from existence. Thus, Zhuangzi and Liezi took function as substance, but their substance was not the true substance. Shen Buhai, Han Fei, Guiguzi, and Fan Li took substance as function, but their function was not the true function. Why not return to the root? What is the root? It is precisely what is called the *Dao* as lord and master.\n\nTo the myriad things, it is the Mother; to man, it is the infant; to the world, it is the King of the Hundred Grains; to the age, it is the Great Antiquity; in function, it is the feminine, the lowly, the mysterious. Thus, those like Gai Gong and Huangshi gathered it into their persons, subtly and perfectly, so that their own bodies became like those of the era of Fuxi. Extending this to the world, they removed excess and extravagance, transforming the cruel and violent Qin into the Wen and Jing eras, where punishments were set aside—was this not the era of Fuxi reborn in later ages? How could it compare to the minor functions and minor harms of legalism, pure talk, and immortality-seeking, or the great functions and great harms of such pursuits?\n\nWe see the infant as if it were yesterday. The myriad things have never been separated from the Mother for a single day. The Hundred Grains have never been apart from their King for a single day. Movement reaches its extreme and must return to stillness; the high reaches its extreme and must return to the low; brilliance reaches its extreme and must return to obscurity. If this is so, then not a single thing fails to return to its root, and not a single day lacks the Great Antiquity. Seek the original mind in the *Five Thousand Words* and you will find it; seek the *Five Thousand Words* in the original mind and nothing will be lacking. A hundred changes do not depart from the root—why trouble oneself with fragmented seeking? Return to the root, and desire is eliminated; eliminate desire, and suppleness is attained. Thus, in non-action, nothing is left undone.\n\nWith this in mind, read the books of the Great Antiquity—perhaps, perhaps!\n\n**II.**\nLaozi’s *Dao* is the *Dao* of the Great Antiquity; his book is the book of the Great Antiquity. How can this be verified? It is verified by the *Records of the Grand Historian*. The state historians were custodians of the books of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. Thus, the Left Historian in Chu could read the ancient texts, and Confucius, when he visited Zhou, also inquired of Lao Dan. Now, examining Laozi’s chapter on *\"The Valley Spirit never dies,\"* Liezi cites it as a book of the Yellow Emperor. Some even claim that the *Five Thousand Words* are all the writings of Rong Cheng. Moreover, the text refers to *\"what the ancients called,\"* *\"it is said in established words,\"* *\"the sage says,\"* and *\"there are words on the use of arms.\"* Thus, Ban Gu said that the Daoists emerged from the ancient historians, and Zhuangzi also said that the *Dao* of antiquity had its place in this. Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard of its influence and delighted in it—is this not clear evidence of transmission rather than creation?\n\nConfucius, observing the Zhou temple, praised the inscription on the metal man, words that seemed to come from Laozi’s own mouth. Examining the *Huanglan* and *Jinkui*, the *Three Seals Inscription* of the metal man was one of the *Six Inscriptions of the Yellow Emperor* recorded in the Han *Records*, the very source of the Yellow Emperor-Laozi lineage. The *Hidden Chamber* and *Records of the Grand Historian* were rich in knowledge and discernment. Those who studied them found what resonated with their nature. Thus, Laozi’s book, such as its discussion of mourning rites and the meaning of victory in war, shows deep understanding of ritual, while his words on *\"losing the Dao and then virtue, losing virtue and then benevolence, losing benevolence and then propriety\"* reveal his profound disdain for the misapplication of ritual in the degenerate age. The more he detested it, the more earnestly he longed for antiquity; the more earnestly he longed, the more deeply he sought. Embracing virtue and holding to the *Dao*, he wrote his book in old age, his intent nothing less than to return this world to the purity of the Great Antiquity.\n\nThe transformations of *qi* follow one another like cold and heat. The Great Antiquity could not but give way to the Tang, Yu, and Three Dynasties; the Tang, Yu, and Three Dynasties could not but give way to later ages. Even within a single family, from great-grandfather to father and son, there are differences. Thus, loyalty, substance, and refinement each arose in turn to remedy excesses, and when excesses reach their extreme, there is a return to the beginning. Confucius preferred frugality over extravagance as the root of ritual, seeking to use loyalty and substance to remedy the excess of refinement. Thus, Laozi’s teachings of purity, simplicity, loyalty, and trust cannot be said to be untimely—they were the harbinger of the Western Han’s resurgence.\n\nYet Confucius edited the *Book of Documents* beginning with Tang and Yu, while Laozi focused exclusively on the *Three August Ones* and above. The greater the distance, the more their positions seem opposed. Thus, his discussions often seem excessively lofty, but this is the natural tendency of his learning, not a deliberate exaggeration. The *Heshang Gong* said: *\"Laozi spoke of my three treasures: first, compassion; second, frugality; third, not daring to be first in the world.\"* Is compassion not benevolence? Is frugality not righteousness? Is not daring to be first not propriety? The *Book of Changes* says: *\"Virtue speaks of abundance; ritual speaks of reverence.\"* It also says: *\"In the past, I had former upright officials whose words were clear and pure.\"*\n\nLaozi possesses this essence. Yet does this mean the Dao of the Grand Antiquity was utterly useless in the world? Or was the world capable of that antiquity while people failed to employ it? It is said: the sage’s works are books for ordering the world, while Laozi’s is a book for saving the world. Had he lived in the age of the Zhou when every household was worthy of enfeoffment, he would have remained silent. But in any other era, his injunctions to eliminate excess, extravagance, and excessiveness would surely find validation in the world. Governance began with the Yellow Emperor, reached completion under Yao, attained perfection in the Three Dynasties, and was annihilated by Qin. When the Han’s qi and fortune were re-created, the people were delivered from fire and water and settled upon their mats—this was no less than the Grand Antiquity. Thus, Cao Shen and the Wen and Jing emperors carved away ornament to restore simplicity, cast nets so wide they let leviathans slip through, and the world was transformed by their influence. For the poisonous sores of Qin and the harsh remedies of Xiang Yu’s brutal rule, a single dose of cool, harmonious relief—gradually administered like food and drink—brought recovery without medicine. When illness arises from medicine itself, even non-treatment may strike the right cure, aligning in principle with the perfected person’s teaching of being free from illness. Who says the degenerate age and the Grand Antiquity are as incompatible as dream and waking?\n\nConsider an infant at the breast: its faculties unopened, scolding and prohibitions are useless—this is the non-action of the Grand Antiquity. As it grows with its celestial purity yet unspoiled, it has no openings for desires, no sprouts of cunning—this is the non-action of the Middle Antiquity. When it errs and is gradually admonished and enlightened, without coercion that might provoke rupture—this is the non-action of the degenerate age. Though the times differ, non-action differs with them, yet the heart of the Grand Antiquity has never been abandoned for a single day. How could it be a matter of stiffening like a wooden puppet while transformation flows like spirit?\n\nLaozi’s book encompasses antiquity and the present, bridging high and low. Those above—Fuxi and Guan Yin—governed by illuminating the Dao. Those in the middle—Cao Shen and the Wen and Jing emperors—governed to save the world. Those below—the Hongwu Emperor, who recited “the people do not fear death” and thus diminished his heart, and the Song Taizu, who heard the warning against fine weapons and changed countenance—acted thus. The Confucians, from Yan Hui onward, have done likewise.\n\nDeep sees deeply, shallow sees shallowly. I cannot attain the Dao and so rely on qi. Thus, drawn to its countermeasures, I return to it again and again.\n\nAlas! The Dao is one and nothing more. When Laozi emerged, it became two; when the Hundred Schools arose, it became a hundred. Does the world truly have so many disparate Ways? Laozi alone, with Guan Yin as his near-perfect embodiment, had nothing more to claim. His teachings passed to Lie Yukou, Yang Zhu, and Zhuang Zhou, giving rise to the learning of emptiness, the learning of self, and the learning of unbridled freedom. Liezi’s emptiness approaches that of the Buddhists, yet his nature is profound and his meaning abstruse—never did he exalt the self or denigrate others, exalt himself to revile the sages, or deceive the foolish to assert his own rightness. He harbored no enmity toward the world. Yang Zhu was revered by the School of Names, Zhuang Zhou by the Jin scholars. Factions arose, each enslaving the other, branching into two streams beyond the pale.\n\nYangzi’s “for me” follows non-action; Zhuangzi’s unrestrainedness follows spontaneity. Yet can spontaneity not govern the self, or non-action not govern the world? Laozi’s spontaneity arises from the utmost emptiness and deepest stillness, grasping the most rigorous and precise essence as its foundation. It desires stillness, not restlessness; weight, not lightness; frugality, not excess. It values tolerance over severity, reverence over license, essentials over trivialities. Thus, in affairs, it always follows rather than initiates, moves only under compulsion, and does not act before necessity. This is what is called spontaneity—how could mere dissipation be spontaneity?\n\nHis non-action in governing the world does not mean governing by not governing, but governing by not governing. Merit remains because it is not claimed; fame is uncontested because it is not contended. Difficulties are resolved in their ease, so they never become difficult. Rare goods are not prized, yet useful things are not discarded. Arms are used only when unavoidable—this is not to say they are never used. Excess, extravagance, and excessiveness are removed, but ordinary affairs are not abandoned. Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish: merely not harming it is how it is preserved.\n\nTo advance by retreating, to deem victory unworthy of praise, to find use in what seems useless—who would say that non-action is insufficient to govern the world? Laozi spoke of rejecting benevolence and abandoning righteousness, yet his heart could not bear it, nor did he dare to act. His intent never ceased to move within these bounds. Zhuang Zhou, however, wandered carefree through the world, disdained power and profit, and rebuked emperors and kings. He wearied of ritual and law, even slandering the sages as thieves. As for the scholars of Wei and Jin, their lack of desire fell short of Zhou’s, and they did not truly grasp what it meant to govern the world through non-action. They dismissed everything as chaff, folded their hands, and claimed governance without action. In the end, the royal net unraveled, and all things shattered. The Legalists then sought to enforce strict discipline, submitting all things to the law, believing they could achieve purity and order. Thus, they restrained others’ desires while indulging their own, embraced boldness in daring while shunning restraint, and practiced cruelty in what they called endurance while rejecting true forbearance. The warm, solitary benevolence and righteousness receded, while cold, thin morality advanced. Was this entirely the Dao of Laozi? Or was it entirely not the Dao of Laozi?\n\nThe Huang-Lao school observed the transformations of the ten thousand things in stillness, grasping the pivot of their opening and closing. Only by restraining the counterflow of one’s nature and enduring it could stillness overcome motion, the female master the male, and softness triumph over hardness. To ascend, one must first descend; to know the masculine, one must guard the feminine. By placing the self outside, the self is preserved; through selflessness, one achieves one’s private ends. This is what is meant by \"reversal is the movement of the Dao, and weakness is the function of the Dao.\"\n\nLater generations, with their hearts set on hasty gains and profit, sought the substance of desirelessness but could not attain it, instead grasping only its contrary mechanism. Thus, they erred in excess or deficiency of the heart—how could they avoid bias and corruption? Laozi was ever cautious, never daring to put himself before others, never willing to harm them. Yet scholars merely seized upon his excesses—his loftiness, his intensity—delighting in what seemed easy, simple, and direct, while inwardly they tore apart his teachings to suit themselves. Such perverse and mistaken views were the cause.\n\nIn the \"Under Heaven\" chapter, Zhuangzi styled himself a \"celestial man,\" placing himself above the \"true man\" and the \"perfected man.\" Han Fei, in his *Explication of Laozi*, went further, dismissing the teachings of tranquility and the insubstantial words of the indistinct as useless doctrines. Could these truly be called followers of Laozi’s school, clinging to it with such scrupulousness?\n\nAmong the Han scholars of the Huang-Lao tradition, Gai Gong, Cao Shen, and Ji An practiced a learning for engagement with the world; Shu Guang and Liu De embodied a learning of contentment; the Four Whiteheads exemplified a learning of reclusion. Zhang Liang, like a dragon, moved freely among these three, embodying their essence and function with ease. Emperor Xuan of Han initially embraced Huang-Lao but later tempered it with the methods of Shen Buhai and Han Fei—what he called the \"blending of kingly and hegemonic ways\" referred to Huang-Lao as the kingly and Shen-Han as the hegemonic.\n\nOnly Zhuge Liang, with his indifference to fame and love of tranquility, his strict yet impartial laws, seemed to follow Huang-Lao yet was not Huang-Lao. Though he inscribed the teachings of Shen Buhai and Han Fei for the Later Lord, in truth, he was not of their school. Alas!\n\nSweet, sour, acrid, and bitter—each taste differs, yet all seek to suit the palate. Medicines are not inherently superior or inferior; their efficacy lies in matching the condition. It rests with the user alone.\n\nThe learning of inner sageliness and outer kingliness has dimmed into obscurity, while the Hundred Schools have strayed without return. Like the five grains and wild grasses, all alike yield no harvest—how lamentable!\n\nIf one’s learning is rooted in the reluctance to act without compassion or daring, then the practice of benevolence and righteousness may indeed be pursued in inquiry.\n\nDoes Laozi harmonize with the Confucians? No, decidedly not. The Dao of Heaven and Earth alternates between yang and yin, yet the Dao of the sage is ever devoted to upholding yang and suppressing yin. Their learning is to be desireless and thus firm—only then is the Dao of the Qian hexagram purely yang, strong and unyielding, centered and upright, sufficient to bind the Three Powers and uphold the Imperial Ultimate.\n\nLaozi, however, champions softness and subordinates firmness, favoring the female, the mother, and water’s virtue of yielding lowliness. Both his essence and function arise from yin. Though yin’s Dao is soft, its mechanism is destructive. Thus, those who study it well become pure, still, compassionate, and kind; those who do not become harsh, relentless, and cunning, turning to military strategy and scheming—though this is not its original truth, it is an inevitable consequence.\n\nDo Laozi and the Buddha align? No, they do not. Within the profound and indistinct, the vague and elusive, there exists essence and substance—this is what he calls the female and the mother. In Buddhism, this is termed \"playing with light and appearances,\" never transcending the consciousness-spirit, and thus failing to return to the true ocean of quiescence. Why? Laozi illuminates life, while the Buddha illuminates death. Laozi engages with the world, while the Buddha transcends it. Laozi’s is the Dao of China’s high antiquity, while the Buddha’s is the teaching beyond the Six Directions. Thus, among those who drew near to Chan, only Liezi did so, for Laozi fundamentally does not align with Chan.\n\nSince the Song dynasty, those who delight in Chan have largely dragged Laozi into Buddhism. The *Classic* states: \"When the people do not fear authority, great authority arrives.\" Su Ziyou, however, claimed that if one is free from the delusive views of life and death, gain and loss, and abides in fearless equanimity, then the great authority of the luminous and vast nature within oneself will manifest resplendently before them. How is this different from calling a deer a horse, or planting millet only to harvest barnyard grass? To honor Laozi by distorting him, to invoke the Buddha while slandering him—when the two are conflated, both are harmed. How much better to keep them apart, so both may remain beautiful?\n\nThe *Heshang Gong Commentary* does not appear in the *Han Records*. It first emerged in the Sui dynasty, and Liu Zhiji of the Tang immediately denounced it as spurious.\n\nThe division into eighty-one chapters aligns broadly yet differs in minor details from the seventy-two chapters of Yan Junping’s *Dao and Virtue Pointing to the Return*, and the seventy-nine chapters of Wang Bi’s original edition. Gu Shenzi took the final seventeen characters of the chapter \"To Bend Is to Become Whole\" and made them the beginning of the next chapter, while Tang Junxiang appended \"To Cease Learning Brings No Sorrow\" to the end of the preceding chapter. By the Yuan dynasty, Wu Cheng had already rearranged the text according to his own judgment, and in recent times, Yao Nai has done likewise—though Yao’s version is the most errant of all. Sima Qian merely stated that the book comprised over five thousand characters, yet some reckless scholars have arbitrarily excised words to meet this count. Fu Yi’s definitive edition, meanwhile, contains many superfluous additions. Wang Bi noted that the chapter \"Fine Weapons Are Inauspicious\" includes later interpolations, while Fu Yi claimed that the four lines beginning \"Ever excelling in saving people\" appear only in the *Heshang Gong* version. The *Hanfeizi* is the earliest source, yet its quotations are often inferior to those in the *Huainanzi*. The *Kaiyuan Imperial Commentary* even appends redundant glosses to \"Feeding on the Mother,\" among other instances of dilution and distortion—how can one enumerate them all? Still more absurd are the wild tales from the western deserts and the fantastical legends of Yan and Qi. One must discern what is authentic, discard what is false, trace the original text, and resolve its divergences—thus may one humbly align with those who transmit and cherish antiquity.\n\nFrom the *Records of the Historian: Biographies of Laozi*:\nLaozi was a native of Quren Village, Lixiang, Ku County in Chu. {*Zhuangzi* records that Confucius and Yang Zhu traveled south to Pei to visit Laozi. The stele inscription by Bian Shao states that Laozi was from Xiang County in Chu. The *Shiwen* commentary on *Zhuangzi* cites a note identifying Laozi as a native of Xiang in Chen; today, this area belongs to Ku County, near Pei. The *Shui Jing Zhu*’s \"Yin Bu\" chapter notes: \"Flowing southeast to Pei, it becomes the Gui River. The Gui River then flows east past the old city of Ku County to the south—this was the Xiang of the Spring and Autumn period. Wang Mang renamed it Lailing. It continues east past the old city of Lai Village to the south, then north past the eastern side of the Laozi Temple, before bending east past the old city of Xiang County to the south. Xiang County is now a wasteland, incorporated into the old city of Ku County. It is said that Laozi was born between Qu and Gui.\" This account is particularly detailed. Lai and Li are phonetic transpositions; the area between Qu and Gui is Quren Village.} His given name was Er, his courtesy name Dan, and his surname Li. {Yao Nai notes: \"This follows the original text of the *Records of the Historian* as cited in the commentary to the *Later Han Annals* under the reign of Emperor Huan. Popular editions give his courtesy name as Boyang and posthumous title as Dan, likely due to flatterers during the Kaiyuan era of the Tang who, claiming descent from Laozi, moved the *Biography of Laozi* to the beginning of the *Records* and altered the historical text accordingly. The *Shiwen* commentary on *Zhuangzi* cites the *Records* as giving his courtesy name as Dan, while *Heshang Gong* gives it as Boyang. Zhang Shoujie’s *Zhengyi* commentary states: 'Dan means ears without rims.' It speculates that Laozi’s ears lacked rims, hence his name Er and courtesy name Dan.\" This shows that early Tang editions had not yet been altered. When Confucius listed the virtuous officials he revered, he referred to them by surname and courtesy name—Yan Pingzhong, Qu Boyu, Lao Dan, and Zichan—consistent with the naming conventions for eminent men. Commoners did not receive posthumous titles, and \"Dan\" does not conform to posthumous naming conventions; its spuriousness is beyond doubt. *Zhuangzi* records Laozi residing in Pei, which was Song territory, and the state of Song had a Lao clan. Thus, Laozi may have been a descendant of the Zi clan of Pei, with \"Zi\" evolving into \"Li\"—much like \"Si\" becoming \"Yi.\" Pengcheng lies near Pei, and it is likely that Dan often resided there, hence the appellation \"Old Peng.\" This is akin to Zhan Qin being called \"Liu Xia.\" Thus, Xing Bing’s commentary stating that \"Old Peng\" refers to Laozi is not without basis.} He served as the Keeper of the Archives in Zhou.\n\nConfucius journeyed to Zhou to inquire about ritual from Laozi. Laozi said: \"The men of whom you speak—both they and their bones have long since decayed. Only their words remain. Moreover, when the noble man encounters his time, he mounts his carriage; when he does not, he drifts like tumbleweed. I have heard that the skilled merchant conceals his wealth as if empty, and the noble man of abundant virtue appears simple in countenance. Rid yourself of your prideful qi and excessive desires, your affected manner and extravagant ambitions. These are all of no benefit to your person. What I have to tell you is only this.\"\n\nConfucius departed and said to his disciples: \"Of birds, I know their ability to fly; of fish, their ability to swim; of beasts, their ability to run. Those that run may be caught in nets, those that swim in lines, those that fly in arrows. But as for the dragon—I cannot know how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend the heavens. Today, I have seen Laozi—is he not like the dragon?\"\n\n{Zhu Xi said: \"Some claim that Old Peng is Laozi. I once suspected this as well. But considering the passages on ritual in *Zengzi’s Questions*, where it speaks of 'transmitting but not creating' and 'trusting and delighting in antiquity,' we can see that Dan was the Keeper of the Archives in Zhou, custodian of the state’s classical texts. The writings of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors—such as the five thousand characters—may have been ancient sayings that Laozi transmitted. *Liezi* cites the *Book of the Yellow Emperor*, which is the chapter 'The Valley Spirit Never Dies.' Chen Hong said: 'When Confucius inquired about ritual from Lao Dan, he must have subtly conveyed an intention to admonish. Laozi perceived this, hence his words about ridding oneself of prideful qi and the like. Otherwise, Confucius was humbly seeking instruction—how could he have been prideful?'\"}\n\nLaozi cultivated the Dao and virtue, taking concealment and namelessness as his duty. He resided in Zhou for many years, but seeing its decline, he departed for the pass. The Keeper of the Pass, Yin Xi, said: \"You are about to withdraw from the world—compel yourself to write a book for me.\" Thereupon, Laozi composed a work in two scrolls, expounding the meaning of the Dao and virtue in over five thousand characters, then departed. No one knew where he went.\n\n{The *Book of Han*’s *Biography of Yang Xiong* states that Lao Dan wrote two scrolls on emptiness and nothingness, which are the \"upper and lower scrolls\" referred to in the *Records of the Historian*. The *Daoist Canon* records that Emperor Jing of Han, deeming Laozi’s thought vast and profound, elevated his work from *zi* (treatise) to *jing* (classic), commanding the court and commoners alike to study it.}\n\nThe *Imperial Commentary* of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang further divided the text into the *Classic of the Dao* and the *Classic of Virtue*, while the *Eighty-One Chapters Commentary* by Heshang Gong additionally assigned titles to each chapter—all later fabrications without ancient basis. Thus, the present edition restores the original division into merely an upper and lower scroll, with chapters numbered sequentially. As for textual variants, the *Explanations of Terms* already notes that the original *Laozi* circulated in many divergent versions. Du Guangting observed that later hands may have excised particles and function words to conform to the five-thousand-character count. Such matters demand careful scrutiny.\n\nSome say: Old Master Lai was also a native of Chu. He composed fifteen scrolls expounding the application of the Daoist teachings and was a contemporary of Confucius. Laozi lived to be over one hundred and sixty years old—or, some say, over two hundred—owing to his cultivation of the Dao and nurturing of longevity.\n\n{The *Han shu*’s *Treatise on Arts and Letters* lists *Old Master Lai* in sixteen scrolls under the Daoist school. The *Biographies of Eminent Recluses* records that Old Master Lai declined an appointment from the King of Chu. The *Biographies of Exemplary Women* states that in his seventieth year, Old Master Lai behaved like an infant to delight his parents. Yet *Zhuangzi* relates that Old Master Lai, while gathering firewood, encountered Confucius and said: \"Cast off your bodily pride and your ostentatious wisdom—this is the mark of a noble man.\" The *Strategies of the Warring States* also quotes a retainer of Qi Huang as saying: \"Have you not heard of Old Master Lai’s instruction to Confucius on serving a lord? He showed him the durability of teeth and how, by sixty, all teeth are worn away.\" These accounts of Laozi’s words and deeds are thoroughly confused. The *Records of the Historian*’s *Biographies of Confucius’s Disciples* states: \"Those whom Confucius revered: in Zhou, Laozi; in Chu, Old Master Lai.\" Thus, they are clearly two distinct persons, both contemporaries of Confucius. The *Zuozhuan* mentions Lai Ju—Lai being his clan name, and \"Old\" a prefix, just as Lie Yukou’s teacher was called Old Master Shang. Both were long-lived adepts of the Dao.}\n\nOne hundred and twenty-nine years after Confucius’s death, the *Records of the Historian* records that Dan, the Grand Scribe of Zhou, met Duke Xian of Qin and said: \"At first, Qin and Zhou were united, then parted. After five hundred years of separation, they will unite again. Seventy years after that union, a hegemon-king will arise.\" Some say Dan was Laozi; others say he was not.\n\nThe world knows not whether this is so or not. {Bi Yuan states: The ancient characters *Dan* (聃) and *Dan* (儋) were interchangeable. The *Shuowen Jiezi* defines *dan* (聃) as \"long ears.\" It further states: *zhan* (瞻) means \"pendulous ears,\" and *dan* (耽) means \"large, pendulous ears.\" Their sounds and meanings being identical, they were used interchangeably. In the south, there was a state called *Zhan’er* (Pendulous-Ears); the *Shanhaijing* and *Lüshi Chunqiu* both write it as *Dan’er* (儋耳), while the *Huainanzi* writes it as *Dan’er* (耽耳). Moreover, the *Lüshi Chunqiu* writes *Lao Dan* (老聃) as *Lao Dan* (老耽). All these are clear evidence. Zheng Kangcheng says: *Lao Dan* was an ancient title for one long-lived. This is a sound interpretation.}\n\nLaozi was a reclusive gentleman. Laozi’s son was named Zong, who became a general of Wei and was enfeoffed at Duan’gan. Zong’s son was Zhu, Zhu’s son was Gong, and Gong’s great-great-grandson was Jia, who served as an instructor to Emperor Wen of Han. Jia’s son, Xie, became Grand Tutor to Prince Ang of Jiaoxi and thus settled his family in Qi. {The *Shiji Kaozheng* states: Emperor Wu of Han was deluded by immortality-seeking magicians, so Sima Qian, in composing the *Biography of Laozi*, recorded his native place and detailed his descendants to show that Laozi was also but a man—no so-called rider of cloud-qi, driver of flying dragons, or being beyond categorization. Thus, he calls him a \"reclusive gentleman\" once, then again a \"reclusive gentleman.\" A good historian’s heart was pained indeed. Zhang Shoujie’s commentary, by contrast, cites absurd and fantastical theories of immortals—truly the case of \"one who, like a summer insect, cannot be told of ice.\" The *Huangshi Richao* says: Daoists claim the Yellow Emperor ascended to heaven.}\n\nLaozi departed westward through the pass as proof of his immortality and undying nature. Yet the Yellow Emperor’s tomb exists, and even Emperor Wu of Han, who so ardently pursued the Dao, personally visited it. Lao Dan’s death is recorded by Zhuang Zhou, who himself studied the Dao—how then can such claims be made?\n\nThose who study Laozi disparage Confucian learning, just as Confucians disparage Laozi. The Way differs, so they do not consult one another—could this be what is meant?\n\nLi Er embodied non-action, allowing transformation to arise spontaneously; he embraced stillness, allowing rectitude to manifest naturally. {The governance of the Yellow Emperor found no greater efficacy than in the Han era, so Sima Qian cited Laozi’s words—“I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves”—to clarify its fundamental principle and correct its later distortions.}\n\n{{The *Tianxia* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* states: “Taking the root as essence, the material as coarse; regarding accumulation as insufficiency, one dwells serenely alone with the divine luminosity.” Among the ancient arts of the Dao, some resided in this. Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard of its influence and delighted in it. They established it upon the constancy of non-being and being, governed it by the Great Unity. They took gentleness, weakness, humility, and lowliness as its outward form, and emptiness, non-destruction of the myriad things as its substance.\n\nGuan Yin said: “Abide in nothingness within oneself, and the forms of things will manifest of their own accord. Its movement is like water, its stillness like a mirror, its response like an echo. Vague, as if forgotten; silent, as if pure. Those who are alike harmonize; those who attain lose. Never taking the lead, yet always following others.”\n\nLao Dan said: “Know the masculine, yet guard the feminine, becoming the world’s valley. Know the white, yet guard the black, becoming the world’s model. Others all seek precedence; I alone take the rear, saying, ‘I bear the world’s filth.’ Others all seek fullness; I alone seek emptiness. Without hoarding, I thus have abundance. Unshaken, I thus abound. In conducting myself, I am unhurried and expend nothing. Through non-action, I mock skill. Others all seek fortune; I alone seek wholeness through bending, saying, ‘May I merely avoid blame.’ Taking depth as the root, frugality as the guiding principle, I say: ‘What is rigid will shatter; what is sharp will dull.’ Always tolerant toward things, never carving into others—this may be called the ultimate attainment. Ah, Guan Yin and Lao Dan! The vast and truly realized persons of antiquity!\"}}\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the enduring Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the enduring name.\nNameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth;\nNamed, it is the mother of the myriad things.\nThus, in constant non-desire, one observes its mystery;\nIn constant desire, one observes its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together yet bear different names.\nTogether they are called the profound.\nProfound beyond profundity—\nThe gateway to all mysteries.\n\nThe perfected person harbors truth in obscurity, yet never speaks of it to others—not out of secrecy, but because the Dao fundamentally cannot be revealed through words or sought in names and traces. Yet when pressed by Guan Yin’s entreaties, Laozi was compelled to write, and thus solemnly declared at the outset: the Dao is most difficult to express. If it could be grasped through analogy or named definitively, it would possess a fixed meaning—and no longer be the ever-present, unchanging truth. To cling to what is not the unchanging truth as the Dao is to speak of benevolence yet harm benevolence, to exalt righteousness yet harm righteousness, to uphold ritual yet harm ritual. From this arise the habits of petty deceit and pretense, and what is called the Dao becomes corrupted—how then could it endure? When Laozi speaks of the Dao, he invariably calls it \"constant\" and \"profound.\" For the Dao is simply nothingness, and \"true constancy\" points to the reality of this nothingness, while \"primordial subtlety\" praises the constancy of this nothingness.\n\nLaozi saw that learning had grown increasingly divergent, mired in being and drowned in traces. He sought to remedy this with the unchanging, incorruptible Dao, and thus began by warning people against grasping words, doctrines, names, and traces as the Dao. Fearing they would lack discernment, he used the principles of heaven, earth, and the myriad things to guide them. Yet still concerned this might not feel intimate enough, he further turned to the moments of human desire and desirelessness, urging introspection. Only then, lest they divide being and nothingness in two, did he unite them under the term \"profound,\" merging their subtleties into the gateway of all mysteries.\n\nAll passages in the text describing the essence of the Dao arise from observing its subtlety; all discussions of its application in affairs arise from observing its manifestations. Only when the mind merges with the spirit and becomes one with the Dao—attaining the profundity beyond profundity—does every manifestation among the myriad things become a manifestation of the myriad subtleties. All teachings on guarding the feminine, on non-contention, on compassion and frugality, on softness and weakness—these countless subtleties all emerge from this constant nothingness. Thus it is called the \"gateway to all mysteries.\" What can be spoken and named is fully contained within the five thousand characters; what cannot be transmitted through words lies in the personal realization of those who embody the Dao. The entire book’s essential meaning is encapsulated here—what is called \"words having a source, affairs having a ruler.\"\n\nMaster Wu Cheng said: The first chapter presents the forms of the two characters *Dao* and *virtue*. The nameless is the Dao; the named is virtue. Laozi’s intent was to regard emptiness and nothingness as that by which heaven and earth become heaven and earth—what Zhuangzi called \"establishing them in constant nothingness and being.\" He saw qi-transformation as that by which the myriad things attain their nature—what Zhuangzi called \"governing them with the Great Unity.\" Thus, his Dao and virtue take emptiness, nothingness, and spontaneity as their essence, and softness, weakness, and non-fullness as their function. The subtlety of observing subtlety is the Dao; the one root of subtlety. The subtleties among the myriad subtleties are virtue; the scattered manifestations of subtlety.\n\nJiao Hong said: *Desire* here is like the *Record of Music*’s \"moved by things and stirred by desire.\" *Manifestation* is read like the *frontier* in \"border frontier,\" referring to the furthest extent of things. Yanzi said, \"The frontier is where virtue returns\"; Liezi said, \"Death is the frontier of virtue\"—both refer to the point of exhaustion. For nothingness in the absence of desire requires no explanation. Only when desire arises do people invariably point to it as being. Yet desire must reach its limit and return to nothingness—how then does this differ from subtlety? Thus it is said, \"These two emerge together yet bear different names.\" This was said out of necessity for those who have not yet awakened. Hence: \"Profound beyond profundity—the gateway to all mysteries.\"\n\nSu Zhe said: Whatever is distant and without limit appears dark and obscure in color. Thus Laozi often used \"profound\" to signify the ultimate.\n\nAll under heaven know beauty as beauty—this is already ugliness. All know goodness as goodness—this is already not goodness. Thus being and non-being give rise to each other; difficulty and ease complete each other; long and short form each other; high and low incline toward each other; sound and voice harmonize with each other; front and back follow each other.\n\nTherefore the sage abides in the affairs of non-action and practices the teaching without words. The myriad things arise yet he does not refuse them. He gives life yet does not possess; he acts yet does not rely; he accomplishes yet does not dwell. Only because he does not dwell does he not depart.\n\nThis clarifies the purport of the first chapter on the constant name and the nameless. For ultimate beauty is without beauty, and ultimate goodness is without goodness. If beauty and goodness are made such that all under heaven know them as beauty and goodness, then they will be traded and entrusted, and cannot endure.\n\nThis likewise resembles the categories of being and non-being, difficulty and ease, long and short, high and low, sound and voice, front and back. Yet when they accord with their time and suit their circumstances, all under heaven call them beauty and goodness. When they do not accord with their time or suit their circumstances, all under heaven call them ugliness and ungoodness. The sage knows that what has a name cannot endure, and thus throughout the day he acts yet has never acted, speaks yet has never spoken. How could he himself know what is beauty or goodness? This is to perceive the subtleties and attain the mystery. In this way, though the myriad things come and he responds accordingly, he gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, and ultimately does not dwell in their names. For the beauty and goodness of what has a name invariably rise and fall with their opposites, since to dwell is to depart. If within oneself there is no dwelling, then where could there be departure? This is the beauty and goodness of non-action and wordless teaching—without anything to oppose them, how could beauty become ugliness or goodness become ungoodness? This is truly what is called constant goodness.\n\nThe inscription reads, \"He acts yet does not begin,\" which complements the meaning precisely. For the myriad things arise, and only then does he respond without refusal. This is the Dao of responsive non-action. Wu Cheng interprets *wei* (为) as speech, citing \"What words does Heaven speak?\" Yao Nai takes *zuo* (作) as \"to employ,\" meaning the sage employs himself for the myriad things without refusing their toil—both miss the original intent.\n\nChapter Two\n\n{ Yao Nai combines this chapter with the following, stating that \"For the myriad things arise, and only then does he respond\" concerns the affairs of non-action, while \"Not esteeming the worthy\" concerns the practice of wordless teaching. This interpretation is not adopted here. }\n\nNot esteeming the worthy,\nso the people do not contend.\nNot prizing rare goods,\nso the people do not steal.\nNot displaying what is desirable,\nso the heart-mind is not confused.\n\n{ Fu Yi’s edition reads: \"so the heart-mind\"; *Huainanzi* omits \"the people.\" }\n\nThus the sage’s governance:\n{ Read in falling tone. Li Daochun’s edition omits \"governance\"; Fu Yi’s edition adds \"also\" after \"governance.\" }\n\nEmpties their heart-minds,\nfills their bellies,\nweakens their ambitions,\nstrengthens their bones.\nEver causes them to be without knowledge,\nwithout desire,\nso that those with knowledge dare not act.\n\n{ *Zhi* read in falling tone. Wang Bi’s edition reads \"the wise\"; Jiao Hong notes one edition omits \"dare\"; Fu Yi’s edition omits \"also.\" }\n\nActing through non-action,\nthen there is nothing not governed.\n\n{ *Zhi* read in falling tone. Fu Yi’s edition reads \"govern\" as \"become\"; another edition adds \"already\" after \"govern.\" The *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi editions omit these. }\n\n{{ *Laozi* }}\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nThis is a scripture for saving the world, and thus its first two chapters set forth its fundamental purpose. Here it proceeds to employ the governance of the great antiquity to correct the ills of the degenerate age. Now, the world falls into disorder because of *you-wei* (purposeful action) that disturbs it. *You-wei* arises from desire, and desire arises from knowledge. Daily, one awakens boundless knowledge, only then to restrain boundless desire—this is like the flooding of the Yangtze and Yellow River, only to later block them with a single reed. The Most High never claimed to possess knowledge, nor did he perceive anything as desirable. Thus, his governance of the world was likewise. What is called \"the worthy\" refers specifically to those of exceptional talent and eccentric conduct. For the noble person loves fame, and the petty person loves profit; both worthiness and wealth are instruments of desire. Therefore, when people esteem one another for worthiness, the people feel shame at being inferior and thus come to contend. When goods are valued for their rarity, the people suffer from their absence and thus come to steal. All this stems from perceiving what is desirable.\n\nIn a well-governed age, people esteem purity and simplicity. There is no need to surpass others through worthiness or knowledge. Things are taken to nourish people, and there is no value in rarity or uselessness. Thus, the worthy and the unworthy are employed alike, and the rare and the common are regarded equally. The people do not perceive these distinctions to disturb their hearts, and so the roots of contention and theft are severed.\n\nNow, the people’s hearts are not empty because they have things to esteem, value, and desire. Their ambitions are not weak because they harbor the seeds of contention, theft, and rebellion. But now, with no external longings, their hearts are empty. Though their bellies are full, they content themselves with chewing and drumming their bellies, their eyes no longer distracting their minds. With no resentment or rivalry, their ambitions are weak. Though their bones are strong, their essence is sufficient and their sinews whole, they have no outlet for exerting their strength.\n\nFor the Dao takes emptiness as its essence and weakness as its function; there is no need for fullness or strength. Thus, only the belly may be filled, and only the bones may be strengthened. By taking emptiness and weakness as the nature of heart and ambition, and relegating strength and fullness to places of no use, their hearts and ambitions remain ever without knowledge and without desire. Without knowledge and without desire, there is non-action. Even if those with keen intelligence and extensive learning emerge, desiring to act, they dare not do so. Through the practice of non-action, the people return to simplicity without realizing it. How could there be anything not well-governed?\n\nMaster Zhang Erqi said: The four—heart, belly, ambition, and bones—are all metaphors. The sage’s governance, in matters of florid embellishment, strives to empty them; in matters of plain substance, strives to fill them; in matters of contention, strives to block them; and in matters of self-cultivation, strives to exalt them. It causes the people to be without knowledge and thus not to generate discriminating views, and to be without desire and thus not to arouse covetous hearts. His explanation also accords. As for later generations of *yangsheng* (nurturing life) practitioners who borrow these four as their doctrine, they have gone astray.\n\n---\n\nChapter Three\n\nThe Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\n{*Chong* (沖). *Shuowen* writes as *zhong* (盅). The Fu Yi edition also writes as *zhong*. *Huainanzi* and other texts write as *chong*. Yao Nai notes: \"The phrase *Dao zhong* rhymes with *zong* (宗).\"}\nIt never fills.\n{The Heshang Gong and Wang Bi editions read \"perhaps does not fill.\" The Kaiyuan and Su Zhe editions read \"appears not to fill.\" The Fu Yi edition reads \"never fills.\" This follows the *Huainanzi*.}\nAbysmal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\n{*Yuān xī*: The Heshang Gong edition reads *yuān hū*. The *Shiwen* reads *yuān ■■*. Note: ■■ is the ancient form of *xī* (兮). This follows the Wang Bi edition.}\nBlunt its sharpness, untangle its knots,\nHarmonize its radiance, merge with its dust.\nProfound, it seems to endure.\n{The stele edition omits *xī* (兮). \"Seems to endure\" reads as \"constantly endures.\" The Heshang Gong and Wang Bi editions read \"as if it exists.\" This follows the Fu Yi edition.}\nI do not know whose child it is—it seems prior to the Lord of Manifestation.\n\n{This chapter concerns the wondrous subtleties of constant non-being. *Shuowen* states: *Zhong* (盅) means an empty vessel. The essence of the Dao is ultimately so, yet in its use, how could it ever be full? Profoundly deep, it gives rise to all things without being objectified by them—thus it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. Now, the reason people’s use of it often errs by becoming full is that they rely on their own sharpness to entangle others, or use their own brilliance to illuminate others’ dust. Blunting one’s sharpness, entanglements dissolve of themselves; harmonizing one’s radiance, dust merges of itself. This is how its use remains never full. Profound, it seems to endure—thus its essence remains empty. Should such a person appear in the world, essence and function would share a single source, returning to the Dao’s original state, seeming prior to the Lord of Manifestation. Yet who could achieve this? Li Yue states: *Xiang* (象) means \"to resemble.\" The nature of the Dao is humble and restrained, hence it does not say it definitively occupies the prior position but says \"seems.\" Su Zhe states: When sharpness is blunted and knots untangled, one does not flow into delusion or become entangled with things. External afflictions are gone, and radiance arises—yet one further harmonizes it, fearing it might differ from things.}\n\nThe dust, though utterly mixed, finds no difference in anything—thus it differs not from the myriad things. Only when the sage’s Dao is like this does it remain whole, then abiding in stillness, ever present. Though present, none recognize it, so it seems but as if present.\n\n*(Yuan’s note on the last two lines: These speak of one who embodies the Dao, plain and intimate. Many scholars take them as speculative extremes. Yet to ask \"whose child is the Dao?\" is too fragmented, and to push the Dao to a place before the Lord of Manifestation is too illusory—thus I reject both.)*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Four**\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent—\nthey treat the myriad things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not benevolent—\nhe treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nis it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet never exhausted,\nthe more it moves, the more it yields.\n\nWords multiply and lead to exhaustion—\nbetter to hold to the center.\n\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female\nis called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nSubtly, it seems to endure—\nits use is never strained.\n\n*(This expresses Laozi’s lament that his Dao goes unheeded, his sorrow that the world’s chaos cannot be saved, and his longing to withdraw, preserving his own integrity. The sage rebukes the rulers of his age—those who claim sagely wisdom for themselves—who bind straw into dogs for sacrifice, then discard and trample them once the rites are done. Seeing the lives of the people in a disordered age as fleeting as straw, Laozi exclaims: \"Alas! Do Heaven and Earth at times lack benevolence, viewing the myriad things as worthless, leaving their life and death to fate? Does the sage not value benevolence, treating the people as mere grass, without care or pity?\" He shifts blame to Heaven and Earth, exalts it as the sage’s doing—yet this is but the language of one who pities Heaven and grieves for humanity, with nowhere to direct his reproach. But if he would shift blame to Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth cannot be blamed. For Heaven and Earth, without intent, bring forth transformation—like a bellows, empty within, where qi moves and yields endlessly. This is what is meant by \"manifesting through benevolence, concealing through function,\" stirring the myriad things without sharing the sage’s cares. Thus the sage rightfully bears concern. Heaven and Earth, without intent, bring forth transformation; the sage, with intent, practices non-action. The responsibility for the hundred clans and myriad things lies with the sage—it is not Heaven and Earth who treat them as straw dogs, but people who do so. At this point, Laozi no longer wishes to speak at length. Yet if we live between Heaven and Earth, unable to ensure each being fulfills its nature, shall we too abandon our own nature, leaving ourselves to be treated as straw dogs by Heaven and humanity? Looking inward to the self, the body is a small Heaven and Earth. Turning within, silently recognizing the center and guarding it—why then clamor with many words, entangling oneself deeply in worldly affairs and inviting the exhaustion of principle and fate? The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* speaks of it: what it calls the \"valley\" is the center; the \"female\" is the valley. The non-abiding abiding—this is how the essence is established.)*\n\nThe use of the useless—this is how one responds to things. If one can truly embody and guard this, in small matters it becomes the art of nurturing life and concentrating qi; in great matters, it is the Dao of emptiness, numinosity, and harmonious response. How could there be any exhaustion? For emptiness responds to conditions—when applied to the world, it becomes the sage’s governance through non-action. If it cannot be applied, mere words are of no benefit and only invite harm. Better to refine the Dao and apply it, returning to the subtly wondrous and undifferentiated within the self. Then one’s personal realm has already attained the age of the primordial sovereigns. This is the teaching of the Supreme without words.\n\nThe bellows without and the key within—when the mechanism is activated, it becomes an instrument for drawing wind. \"Exhausted\" means depleted. At first, Heaven, Earth, and the sage are spoken of together, but afterward only Heaven and Earth are mentioned, omitting the sage—this is precisely Laozi’s reason for not wishing to speak at length. \"Exhaustion of fate\" (*shu qiong*): the *Shiwen* glosses this as the exhaustion of principle and the momentum of fate. \"The center\" is the empty center, referring to the heart-mind. The metaphors of valley, female, and the back’s center—\"valley spirit\" (*gu shen*) illustrates its virtue, while \"mysterious female\" (*xuan pin*) illustrates its function. The valley’s relation to echo: only because it receives all things without exception does it ceaselessly respond. This is how its spirit abides within the center and never dies. Among all things under Heaven, only the female can receive and give birth. As for receiving without revealing how it receives, or generating without revealing how it generates—this is the most profoundly unfathomable female. It can mother the myriad things, and all things emerge from this gate. Is this not the root of Heaven and Earth? It is precisely what the first chapter calls \"the nameless, the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the named, the mother of the myriad things.\" This is the constant Dao.\n\n\"Subtly continuous, as if existing\"—this is the subtlety of observing the wondrous. \"Used without exhaustion\"—this is the subtlety of observing the minute. Wu Cheng said: When the valley is empty, the spirit abides within. \"As if existing\" is the spirit’s abiding. \"Exhaustion\" means labor. Generally, when qi is at ease and used, it is nurtured and daily increases; when overused, it is depleted and greatly consumed. When the spirit constantly abides, qi is not dissipated.\n\nThe *Heshang Gong* commentary often treats \"guarding the center\" and the preceding text as the previous chapter, while Yao Nai combines \"guarding the center\" with the following \"Valley Spirit\" as the subsequent chapter. This is because these two lines serve as a transitional bridge, allowing them to belong to either the preceding or following section without contradiction. Yet, their meaning remains incomplete in isolation. Only the *Yongle Encyclopedia*’s version of Wang Bi’s text and Wu Cheng’s edition present them as a single chapter. Here, we follow this convention.\n\nThe *Liezi* cites the lines from \"Valley Spirit\" onward as the words of the Yellow Emperor, demonstrating that Laozi’s speech had just concluded, and these ancient sayings were then quoted to clarify his meaning. There can be no doubt that they do not constitute a separate chapter. Commentators throughout history have often misconstrued this passage, disjointing its beginning and end, and fragmenting its meaning. The most egregious error lies in interpreting \"straw dogs\" as exemplifying the Dao of objects being without intent. Yet, \"straw dogs\" and humans are two distinct things—how could the sage treat the people as straw dogs? Moreover, the Three Treasures begin with *ci* (compassion), and Heaven protects and saves through this very compassion.\n\nYet he earnestly and painfully warns against the ominousness of fine weaponry. If one were to take \"without compassion\" as a teaching, how could a single man’s words be so self-contradictory? Moreover, such an interpretation fails to cohere with the chapter as a whole. To liken the bellows to an analogy of \"guarding the center,\" or to construe \"exhaustion through multiplicity\" as the depletion of *qi* from excessive speech—these are grave distortions. Wang Dao once said: \"Later generations, failing to understand the passage on straw dogs and the ten thousand things, have thus claimed that the calamities of the Dao and virtue devolved into penal laws. This, too, is a verification of ‘exhaustion through multiplicity.’\" If Laozi composed his book and his words were truly thus, was there not some great necessity within him? This judgment is sound indeed.\n\n\"Heaven and Earth endure long.\"\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can be long and enduring is that they do not live for themselves.\n\nThus they can attain long life. {The stele version reads \"long and enduring.\"} Therefore, the sage places the self behind and yet the self leads; sets the self aside and yet the self endures. Is this not because they are without self-interest? {Fu Yi’s version replaces \"not\" with \"is.\" The *Heshang Gong* version omits the phrase \"Is this not.\" This follows the *Huainanzi* manuscript and Wang Bi’s edition.} Thus they fulfill their self-interest.\n\n{{The preceding chapter speaks of the \"valley spirit that does not die,\" revealing the root of Heaven and Earth. This is why Heaven and Earth can be long and enduring. Heaven bestows, Earth produces, yet they do not claim their life as their own. Thus they attain long life. If Heaven and Earth were to act selfishly for their own sake, they would be but one thing among things—how then could they be long and enduring? Therefore, the sage abides in softness and lowliness, fundamentally putting others first and the self behind, yet people esteem them all the more. They desire little and seek nothing, fundamentally benefiting others by setting the self aside, yet people harm them all the less. In placing the self behind and setting the self aside—is this not because the heart is without self-interest? Yet by leading and enduring, they fulfill their self-interest. This is simply the natural principle and tendency of things.\n\nMaster Cheng says: \"Heaven, Earth, and humanity share a single source. What makes Heaven Heaven, Earth Earth, and humanity human is fundamentally the same. Yet why can Heaven and Earth be long and enduring while humanity alone cannot? Heaven does not know it is Heaven; Earth does not know it is Earth. But once one takes form as a human, one recognizes it as oneself, saying, 'It is I, it is I!' One believes this body cannot be left unloved, and so pursues matters of distinction and adornment. One believes nurturing life cannot be without things, and so chases after endless desires. The more one values the self, the more the self is humiliated; the more one enriches the self, the more the self is harmed. Is this not the world’s way of losing life—precisely because one is burdened by possessing it? Such is the purport of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. How could those who cultivate life by selfishly cherishing their bodies ever claim to follow it?\"\n\nLi Jiamo says: \"Heaven does not begrudge its bestowal; Earth does not begrudge its production. This is called 'not living for themselves.' By not living for themselves, the ten thousand things rely on them to live. Thus they attain long life. This is the Dao of Heaven’s bestowal and Earth’s production, which has never ceased for a single day.\"}}\n\nRight: Chapter Six.\n\nChapter Seven.\n\nThe highest virtue is like water.\nWater virtuously benefits the ten thousand things yet does not contend.\n{Chen Jingyuan’s version adds: \"and does not contend.\"}\nIt dwells where the multitude abhors,\nand thus comes near the Dao.\n{For \"dwells,\" Fu Yi’s version reads \"resides.\" The Song Huizong edition omits the character *zhi* (之) after \"multitude.\" *E* (恶) is read in the falling tone. Fu Yi’s version includes the character *yi* (矣) after \"Dao.\"}\n\nIn dwelling, it is good at abiding in the earth.\nIn heart, it is good at profound stillness.\nIn giving, it is good at kindness.\n{For \"kindness,\" Fu Yi’s version reads \"humaneness.\"}\nIn speech, it is good at trustworthiness.\nIn governance, it is good at order.\nIn affairs, it is good at capability.\nIn movement, it is good at timeliness.\nOnly by not contending\ndoes it remain without blame.\n{Fu Yi’s version includes the character *yi* (矣) after \"blame.\"}\n\n{{Li Zhizao says: To benefit things is called \"virtue,\" yet those who benefit things cannot but contend—this is not the highest virtue. Only water is otherwise. Where the multitude dwells above, it alone dwells below. Where the crowd gathers in ease, it alone abides in peril. Where others seek purity, it alone dwells in filth. Its dwelling is entirely where the multitude abhors—with whom would it contend? This is why it is the highest virtue. From \"dwelling in good earth\" onward, the text speaks of the sage’s benefiting things without contention in reality, no longer referring to water.\n\nLü Huiqing says: The rivers and seas can be lords of the hundred valleys because they are good at dwelling below—this is what is meant by \"dwelling in good earth.\" The seven virtues emerge from non-contention, but their essence lies in \"dwelling in good earth.\" For if one dwells in good earth, one can abide where the multitude abhors, and thus, without contending, none in the world can contend with them.\n\nWu Cheng says: The examples given from \"dwelling in good earth\" onward all select what the multitude deems good to be called \"good\"—this is not the highest virtue. Only when one possesses this virtue and yet does not contend, like water’s source dwelling above yet willingly abiding below, is it the highest virtue. The multitude abhors dwelling below and thus must prefer dwelling above; those who desire to surpass others harbor contentious hearts. With contention comes blame, but without contention, what blame can there be?\n\nSu Zhe says: \"One yin and one yang—this is called the Dao. That which continues it is virtue.\" Heaven’s one generates water. The Dao moves and becomes virtue, just as qi moves and becomes water. Both emerge from non-being into being, not far removed from the Dao, and thus may be named \"virtue.\" Nothing surpasses this. The Dao is present everywhere; water benefits everything. Avoiding the high and tending toward the low, it never resists—this is \"good at abiding in the earth.\" Empty and profoundly still, its depths unfathomable—this is \"good at profound stillness.\" Drawn from yet inexhaustible, bestowing without seeking repayment—this is \"good at kindness.\" Round, it must revolve; square, it must break; obstructed, it must halt; released, it must flow—this is \"good at trustworthiness.\" Washing away all filth, leveling high and low—this is \"good at order.\" To bear is to float; to reflect is to clarify; to strike is to overcome all hardness—this is \"good at capability.\" Unceasing day and night, filling depressions before advancing—this is \"good at timeliness.\" Those who possess flaws yet escape human reproach do so because they contend. Water alone embodies these seven virtues without contention, and thus remains without blame.\n\nEditor’s note: The explanations from \"dwelling in good earth\" onward may apply to water or to humans, all being coherent. Yet to take these as the highest virtue is not as apt as the interpretation that non-contention is the highest virtue.}}\n\nTo hold and fill it to overflowing—better to cease.\n{*Hold*: Sima’s edition reads *rely*.}\nTo grind and sharpen it—it cannot be long preserved.\n{*Fu Yi’s edition reads*: “To polish and delight in it.” Wang Bi also reads *delight*. This follows the *Huainanzi*. *Preserve*: the stele edition reads *treasure*.}\nGold and jade fill the chamber—none can guard them.\n{*Chamber*: the *Heshang Gong* and other editions read *hall*. Later editions follow Wang Bi and Fu Yi’s versions.}\nWealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting one’s own downfall.\n{*Arrogance*: Sima’s edition reads *haughtiness*.}\nTo withdraw when merit is achieved and fame is secured—this is the Dao of Heaven.\n{The stele edition reads: “When fame and merit are achieved, withdraw the self.” Wang Bi reads: “When merit is achieved, withdraw the self.” Li Yue’s edition reads *affairs* for *fame*. This follows the *Huainanzi* citation.}\n\n{To hold and fill it: to fill and then hold it. To grind and sharpen it: to sharpen and then grind it. To know it is full yet still hold it, to know it is sharp yet still grind it—this is already unskillful. How much worse, then, to fill without holding, to let gold and jade fill the hall? One will amass much only to lose it heavily, and none can guard it. How much worse to sharpen without grinding, to grow ever more arrogant in wealth and honor? Before one can arrogantly lord over others, one first invites one’s own downfall. For only by remaining full without overflowing can one long preserve wealth; only by standing high without peril can one long preserve honor. How, then, can one avoid overflowing and peril? By modeling the Dao of Heaven. The sun at noon must decline; the moon at full must wane. The turning of the four seasons ensures that those who achieve success withdraw. If even Heaven and Earth act thus, how much more should humans?}\n\nTo speak of excess: knowing advance but not retreat, knowing existence but not demise, knowing gain but not loss—thus movement brings regret. The sage accomplishes yet does not possess, abides in fullness without overflow, attains renown yet does not dwell in it, abides in sharpness without peril. For one adapts to matters great and small, preserving oneself wholly—hence it is called \"accomplishment\" and \"attainment.\" If one knows not contentment, when can there be accomplishment? On what day can there be attainment?\n\nThis does not mean one must dwell in mountain forests, severing human affairs, before entering the Dao. Even amid merit, fame, wealth, and honor, one may abide by and practice it.\n\n---\n\nCarry the hun-soul and embrace the One—can you never part from it?\nConcentrate qi to utmost softness—can you be like an infant?\nPurify and refine the mysterious mirror—can you leave no blemish?\nLove the people and govern the state—can you do so without action?\nThe gates of Heaven open and close—can you remain the female?\nUnderstand the four directions—can you do so without knowledge?\nIt gives life and nurtures, gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely,\nleads yet does not dominate—this is called profound virtue.\n\nTo tend the po-soul is to tend the hun-soul and po-soul. The po-soul is the One. To \"carry\" is to embrace. The hun-soul carries the po-soul—movement guarding stillness. The essence and clarity of the heart are called hun-soul and po-soul, which are not two things in origin. Yet the hun-soul moves while the po-soul remains still. If the heart is enslaved by things, they separate into two, and spirit no longer abides in its dwelling, while blood and qi take control. Only by embracing them as one, allowing form and spirit to depend on each other, so that movement and stillness are not lost, do hun-soul and po-soul become one—po-soul as hun-soul, hun-soul as po-soul. What dissipation? What dullness? Thus may they endure long. For it is not the difficulty of occasionally carrying them, nor the difficulty of embracing the One, but the difficulty of never parting from them. The Dao of cultivating the body and nurturing life is always thus.\n\n\"Concentrate\" means to make stillness its essence. To concentrate is to be single-minded, pure, and steadfast, without any outward dispersion—this is what is called the guarding of pure qi. If there is the slightest loss to coarseness, it becomes rigid and cannot be soft. It must be like an infant, with harmonious qi inwardly full, unified and unadulterated, before it can be utmost softness. The perfected person is not externally hindered by the po-soul nor internally driven by qi—his self-governance may be called excellent. Yet he still fears the lingering presence of flaws. The flaws of the untrained are coarse and easy to correct; the flaws of the trained are subtle and difficult to remove. Some, in their guarding, become stagnant and fail in application; others, in their adherence, remain untransformed and cling to the self-view. These are all sufficient to cause illness and fall short of the profound. One must add the work of cleansing and removing blemishes, further employing the mirror of inward reflection. Only then may it truly be pure, in accord with nature, and free from all flaws? Jiao Hong said: \"The preceding three sayings...\"\n\nLaozi’s instructions to people may be called incisive. Yet the wise eliminate the mind but not affairs, while the benighted eliminate affairs but not the mind. Should one misconstrue his earlier words, how few would avoid taking the \"bent axle\" as their path of study! Thus he further clarifies: \"What I speak of as 'bearing and nourishing the po-soul' does not mean clasping silence—it means loving the people and governing the state while practicing non-action. This is what is called 'acting through non-action.' 'Concentrating qi to attain softness' does not mean stifling closure—it means that the Gate of Heaven opens and shuts while one abides in femininity. This is what is called 'the male guarding the female.' 'Cleansing and contemplating the mysterious mirror' does not mean obscuring darkness—it means being enlightened in all four directions while maintaining non-knowing. This is what is called 'knowing the unknowing.'\n\nNow, loving the people and governing the state, the Gate of Heaven opening and shutting, being enlightened in all four directions—when it comes to nurturing life, these are all acts of fostering and leading, none of which are abandoned. Yet through non-action, abiding in femininity, and non-knowing, life is not possessed, action is not relied upon, and leadership is not domineering. What is this if not profound virtue? This is what Guan Yinzi meant by 'having no abode within oneself, yet the forms of things manifest naturally,' and what Zhuangzi meant by 'taking emptiness and the indestructibility of the myriad things as the real.'\n\nHow could this mean abandoning the reality of human affairs to rely solely on emptiness and nothingness? Su Zhe said: \"The sage, having cultivated the Dao within himself, extends its surplus to govern others. Yet he encounters all with a mindless heart. If he were to act with intention, then loving the people would only harm them, and governing the state would only bring disorder. Yang moves and yin is still; one opens and one shuts—from this arise order and chaos, rise and fall. The multitude, facing such moments, are anxious over gain and loss, always seeking fortune before the fact. The sage follows principle and understands the Mandate of Heaven, responding only after being prompted—this is what is called 'preceding Heaven yet Heaven does not oppose, following Heaven yet conforming to its seasons.' It means that his timing, whether early or late, perfectly accords with the Mandate of Heaven. Thus, one who can abide in femininity does not miss the moment.\"\n\nLi Zhi said: \"Embracing the mysterious and guarding the One, the spirit does not stray outward. With a master within, the Gate of Heaven’s opening and shutting remain ever in one’s control. As for those in the world who cannot master themselves: when there is opening, they rush forth without being pressed; when there is shutting, they resist without being at ease. This is inner dissipation—how can they embrace the One without parting from it?\"\n\nZhang Erqi said: \"The 'primal contemplation' is the observation of the wondrous and the subtle. The 'opening and shutting of the Gate of Heaven' refers to the movement and transformation of the mind.\" Zhu Xi said: \"The learning of Laozi takes emptiness, stillness, non-action, and humble self-restraint as its essence. It does not originally share the same purport as Zhuangzi and the Buddhist teachings.\"\n\nThose who expound the text often seek to conflate and unify these ideas, asserting that spirit perpetually bears the corporeal soul and reaches everywhere without exception. This is the common misconception of those who interpret Laozi.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nine**\nThirty spokes share one hub;\nWhere it is hollow, there lies the use of the cart.\nClay is kneaded to shape a vessel;\nWhere it is hollow, there lies the use of the vessel.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room;\nWhere it is hollow, there lies the use of the room.\nThus, what is present provides the advantage,\nWhile what is absent enables the function.\n\n---\n\n*Spokes* are the rods of a wheel. The *hub* is the center where all spokes converge. The *Kao Gong Ji* states: \"The hub is what allows for smooth turning.\" Smooth turning relies on what is not there—precisely the same principle. *Kneading* means to blend; *clay* is sticky earth. Water and earth are mixed and fired to make pottery. In every dwelling, the door is to the east and the window to the west. Doors allow entry and exit; windows permit light and air. *Absence* refers to the empty, hollow spaces.\n\nWu Cheng said: \"Vessels store things; empty space shelters people. Carts bear weight and travel far—all serve as advantages for the world. The advantage lies in what is present. Yet the use of a cart depends on its axle’s turning, the use of a vessel on its capacity to hold, and the use of a room on its openings for entry, exit, and illumination—all of which reside in the unobstructed, empty spaces. The human abdomen is solid, while the heart is hollow—just like this.\"\n\nLü Huiqing said:\n\nWithout the *having*, there is no *absence*—it is absence that enables its function. Without the *absence*, there is no *having*—it is having that applies its benefit. Observe carts, vessels, and dwellings, and the principle is not far off. Yet when it comes to the body, one fails to recognize what enables its function.\n\nThus, the sage enters without ever possessing anything—thereby perceiving its mystery. They emerge without ever lacking anything—thereby perceiving its manifestations. Hence it is said: \"Beneficial use secures the body; entering the spirit enables its function.\" To know the unity of these two, which cannot be separated—this is perfection.\n\nXue Hui said: \"Though the chapter’s end speaks of *having* and *absence* together, its intent is to clarify the value of *absence* within *having*. For the benefit of *having* is obvious to all, while the function of *absence* is overlooked and unexamined. Thus, it borrows familiar examples to make this clear.\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Ten**\nThe five colors blind the eyes.\nThe five tones deafen the ears.\nThe five flavors dull the palate.\nRacing and hunting madden the heart.\nRare goods corrupt conduct.\n\nTherefore, the sage attends to the belly, not the eyes—rejecting that, embracing this.\n\nThe term *shuang* (爽) means the loss of the true flavor. Gazing too long leads to dizziness; hearing too much causes confusion; tasting too often brings satiety. The heart, unsettled, thus becomes frenzied. Not knowing contentment invites disgrace—hence conduct is impaired.\n\nLi Shiyue said: \"The eyes are insatiable; the belly knows sufficiency. Thus the sage’s rejection and embrace differ. The eyes look outward—hence called *that*; the belly is inwardly full—hence called *this*.\"\n\nLü Huiqing said: \"The belly is without awareness; the eyes possess perception. Therefore, the sage rejects *that*—the pursuit of what is seen and desired—and embraces *this*—the emptiness and stillness of what is without knowledge or desire. This resembles the *Yi Jing*’s ‘stopping at the back’ and the *Yin Fu Jing*’s principle that the mechanism lies in the eyes.\"\n\nYe Sijing said: \"All external objects of desire harm the body. The sage attends only to filling the belly to nourish the self, not to pleasing the eyes by yielding to things. Yet flavors, sounds, and colors—these cannot be entirely severed. Only by acting without attachment to things can one abide in profound desirelessness. All defilement and pursuit of sensory realms begin with the eyes—hence the text addresses this from start to finish. This is why Yanzi’s *Four Abstentions* begin with sight, and the severing of the six senses places eye and form first. The previous chapter spoke of the function of emptiness within; this one warns against being filled by external perversions.\"\n\nFavor and disgrace are like alarm. Prize great trouble as you do your own body.\n\nWhat is meant by \"favor and disgrace\"? {Some versions include \"like alarm\" in this line; the *Heshang* and *Kaiyuan* editions omit it.} Favor is inferior. {These three characters follow the versions of Wang Bi, Fu Yi, and the *Kaiyuan* edition. The *Heshang* edition reads: \"What is meant by 'favor and disgrace'? Disgrace is inferior.\" Chen Jingxian and Li Daochun read: \"What is meant by 'favor and disgrace like alarm'? Favor is superior; disgrace is inferior.\" Both are erroneous.} To gain it is like alarm; to lose it is like alarm. This is what is meant by \"favor and disgrace are like alarm.\" {The Wu Cheng edition omits these six characters.}\n\nWhat is meant by \"prizing great trouble as you do your own body\"? The reason I have great trouble {One edition omits the character \"者.\"} is solely because I have a body. If I had no body, {The character \"苟\" appears here; all other editions read \"及.\" This follows the Fu Yi edition.} what trouble could I have?\n\nThus, one who prizes their body for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world. One who cherishes their body for the sake of the world may be relied upon with the world. {The character \"于\" is omitted below \"寄\" and \"托\" in all other editions. The *Kaiyuan* edition reads \"若\" in place of both \"可\" characters. The Fu Yi edition includes \"者\" below each \"天下,\" reads \"则\" above both \"可\" characters, and adds \"矣\" at the end of each \"天下.\" These four lines follow the *Huainanzi* and *Heshang* editions.}\n\nGlory—this is honor. Honor—this is weight. The people of the world do not recognize disgrace as disgrace and so prize it; they do not recognize trouble as trouble and so value it. Thus, they glorify their own disgrace and honor their own trouble. Like alarm—this vividly describes how they prize it. Like the body—this vividly describes how they value it. Now, no one fails to detest disgrace or fear trouble, yet they reverse course and call it honor and value—how can this be? It is because the world’s people grow accustomed to delusion, failing to return to their root; they grow complacent in their present circumstances, never observing their end.\n\nWhat does it mean for people to honor their disgrace? Precisely that what can be disgraced is what they call honor. For one who honors others is above them, while one who is honored by others is beneath them. To be beneath others—what is this if not disgrace? Yet the world reverses this and glorifies it. Gaining it, they are alarmed with joy; losing it, they are alarmed with sorrow. Is this not honoring disgrace alone?\n\nThe honor in \"honor and disgrace\" refers to oneself; the honor in \"being honored as beneath\" refers to others. What does it mean for people to value their trouble as they do their body? Precisely that what can trouble them is what they deem indispensable. People are self-serving by nature: with desire comes trouble. If one could transcend the body and detach from it, what trouble would there be in gain or loss? Thus, all the desires one cultivates for the body—what are these if not great trouble? Yet people cling to them as if they were born with them and refuse to relinquish them even briefly. Is this not valuing great trouble as one does the body? This is all because they do not understand the Dao of self-respect and self-care.\n\nRelying on others’ honor to feel weighty only leads to self-diminishment. If one could truly respect oneself, even if the world glorified them, they would not lightly place their body in such a position. Pursuing external gains to indulge oneself only leads to self-suffering. If one could truly care for oneself, even if entrusted with the world, they would cherish their body and not take it on lightly. In this way, it is as if one lodges the body between Heaven and Earth—possessing the world yet not clinging to it, as if merely a temporary guest.\n\nThe *Huainanzi* cites Laozi’s words here, illustrating them with the example of King Tai fleeing Bin, staff in hand, to settle beneath Mount Qi. Indeed, one who cannot be honored—what disgrace is there? One who values nothing beyond the body—what trouble do they bring upon themselves?\n\nThe interpretations of this chapter vary widely. Most take \"alarmed by honor\" as natural, \"forgetting the body\" as an illusion, and \"entrusting and relying\" as a weighty responsibility. Here, I reject all such readings and select only those that align more closely.\n\nWu Cheng says: What people regard as glory, from the perspective of one who understands the Dao, is disgrace—what is there to love? Yet those who love it are alarmed by it. What people regard as great profit, from the perspective of one who understands the Dao, is great trouble—how can it be valued? Yet those who value it cling to it as if it were their body. Thus, being honored is ultimately base, yet gain and loss disturb the heart; things outside the body are ultimately trivial, yet they are treated as if inseparable from it—such delusion is extreme.\n\nLü Huiqing says: Honor is what one is kept by others—it is the lower Dao. To be honored and possess that honor is to invite disgrace. The reason I have disgrace is because I have alarm: alarmed by gain, then alarmed by loss. If I had no alarm, what disgrace would I have? The reason I have great trouble is because I have a body. Thus, fortune is my trouble, and misfortune is my trouble. If I had no body, what trouble would I have?\n\nChapter Twelve\n\nWhat is seen yet unseen is called the Even.\nWhat is heard yet unheard is called the Rare.\nWhat is grasped yet unattainable is called

scholars...\n\nThe Dao is subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating—\nso deep it cannot be known.\nPrecisely because it cannot be known,\nwe forcefully give it form:\n\nHesitant, as if fording a river in winter;\ncautious, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;\nsolemn, as a guest before the host;\ndissolving, as ice about to melt;\nsimple, as uncarved wood;\nopen, as a valley;\nturbid, as muddied waters.\n\nWho can still the turbid to gradually clarify?\nWho can settle the restless to gradually quicken?\n\nThose who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness.\nOnly by not being full\ncan one remain concealed and not be newly made.\n\nThis chapter speaks not of sages or perfected beings but of those who skillfully serve as scholars—\nit reveals the essential gateway to entering the Dao,\nand forcibly depicts its demeanor.\n\nFrom the coarse, one advances to the subtle;\nfrom the subtle, to the wondrous;\nfrom the wondrous, to the mysterious—\nthen there is nothing it does not penetrate, yet it remains profoundly unknowable.\n\nCaution before action is called \"deliberation.\"\nWhen one acts only under compulsion,\nit is out of necessity.\nHesitation without proceeding is called \"indecision.\"\nWhen one resists what is undesired,\nit is with reluctance, as if fearing something.\nSolemn as a guest, one dares not act presumptuously.\nThese three demeanors show how those with the Dao dare not put themselves before the world.\n\nYet their deliberation, indecision, and solemn reverence\nare not due to rigid attachment or refusal to transform.\nThey dissolve like ice about to melt,\nnaturally formless, so that things do not perceive them—\nhow could there be any stagnation?\n\nThus, the next three are used to depict it further:\nwhen the Dao reaches the point of dissolution,\nit returns to its root and restores wholeness,\npreserving the integrity of Heavenly nature without carving it with human artifice—\nhence, it is like uncarved wood.\nWhen nature is whole yet does not claim its wholeness,\nit receives all things—\nhence, it is like a valley.\nWater’s nature is fundamentally clear, yet it does not purify itself for things—\nhence, it is like turbidity.\n\nThese seven depict the demeanor of one with the Dao,\nand also the essential means of seeking it.\nDeliberation, indecision, and solemn reverence\nare how one enters virtue.\nOnly after dissolving like melting ice\ncan one approach the simplicity of unhewn wood\nand the vast, undifferentiated wholeness—\nthis is how virtue is perfected.\n\nWhen the Dao reaches turbidity,\nit harmonizes its light and mingles with the dust,\nbecoming one with all things—\nthis is the ultimate forgetting of self, the most difficult attainment.\nThus, following the mention of turbidity, it asks:\n*Who can still the turbid?*\nTurbidity is the moment of movement;\nwhen movement endures, it becomes still—\nbut I fear it may then become sharply clear.\nThus, following stillness, it asks:\n*Who can settle for long?*\nSettling is the moment of stillness;\nwhen stillness gives way to movement,\nI fear it may again stir into restless arising.\n\nThese are those who know the Dao yet cannot preserve it.\nThe reason they cannot preserve it\nis that they are easily filled.\nThus, discrimination and restlessness seize them,\nand they cannot remain still or endure.\nOnly by not filling oneself with goodness\ncan one abide in decay without seeking renewal—\nthis is how one can still the turbid\nand settle for long.\n\nThus, the subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating Dao may be preserved.\nFor the simplicity of unhewn wood and the vastness of the valley are the demeanor of turbidity,\nwhile deliberation, indecision, and solemn reverence are the demeanor of settling—\nboth are attained through emptiness\nand lost through fullness.\n\nLaozi’s teaching that *great accomplishment seems incomplete, yet its use is never exhausted*,\nand *great fullness seems empty, yet its use is inexhaustible*—\nthis is what it means to preserve this Dao.\n\nTo reach the utmost emptiness,\nhold fast to stillness with unwavering depth.\nThe myriad things arise together,\nand through this I observe their return.\n\n{*Stillness*: Fu Yi and others write *serenity*. *I* below: the *Heshang Gong* version includes this character. *Observe* below: Wang Bi omits this character; this follows the *Huainanzi*.}\n\nNow, things flourish in abundance,\neach returning to its root.\n{*Now, things*: the *Shiwen* notes, \"One version reads *all things*.\" Fu Yi writes *flourish* as ■■■■. Wang Bi includes *return* after *each*. The *Zhuangzi* reads, \"The myriad things in profusion, each returning to its root.\"}\n\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nstillness is called returning to one’s mandate.\nReturning to one’s mandate is called constancy.\nTo know constancy is called illumination.\nNot knowing constancy—\nreckless action brings misfortune.\nKnowing constancy brings capacity;\ncapacity brings impartiality;\nimpartiality brings kingship;\nkingship brings heaven.\n{The stele version reads: *Impartiality can give life; life can reach heaven.*}\nHeaven brings the Dao;\nthe Dao brings enduringness.\nTo the end of one’s days, one will not be imperiled.\n\n{This thoroughly expounds the essence of embodying constancy, and its entry lies in observing return. Observing return is observing the subtle. The five lines from *Now, things flourish* above demonstrate the natural principle of things, advancing the notion that movement invariably returns to stillness. From *To know constancy is called illumination* below, it speaks of the clarity of the Daoist who observes return, and the efficacy of reaching emptiness and guarding stillness. *To reach* means to attain its utmost. *Emptiness* means desirelessness. Without desire, there is stillness—when external things do not enter, the inner heart does not emerge. *Unwavering* means steadfast. In cultivating the Dao, to reach emptiness is to attain its utmost, and thus one’s guarding of stillness becomes steadfast. Hence, the following text focuses solely on the utmost stillness.\n\nTo reach emptiness without knowing that the actual is emptiness, or to guard stillness without knowing that movement is stillness, is to observe nothingness in nothingness without observing nothingness in being. All being arises from emptiness, and all movement arises from stillness. Thus, though the myriad things arise together, they ultimately return to emptiness and stillness—this is the utmost steadfastness of things. Yet ordinary people only see return after things cease, or see their return to the root after they decline. Only those who know the Dao, having reached the utmost emptiness and stillness, perceive the arising of things and their flourishing in abundance. What causes them to arise is what causes them to return. Knowing that all arising is illusory and that stillness is constant, they grasp the mandate of nature to govern all phenomena—constantly having and constantly lacking, constantly acting and constantly still. This is called knowing the subtleties. How could there be misfortune from reckless action?\n\nSuch knowledge is not mere hearing, seeing, or conjecture. It is the ability to merge with the unity of self and things, to be all-embracing externally and free from private bias internally—this is nearly true knowledge. Thus, in its greatness, it is inner sageliness and outer kingship; in its transformation, it unites with heaven and exhausts the Dao. To exhaust the Dao is nothing other than constancy. To endure without peril is to abide in constancy.\n\n○ Su Shi’s younger brother Zhe said: If one does not reach the utmost emptiness, something remains unvanished. If one does not guard stillness with unwavering depth, movement remains unvanished. Though mountains and hills may be removed, the finest dust is not yet gone—this is not the utmost or the unwavering. Without reaching the utmost or guarding with depth, it is difficult to expect the efficacy of emptiness and stillness. Only by reaching the utmost emptiness and unwavering stillness can one observe the changes of the myriad things without being disturbed by them, knowing that all arising must return. If I, too, were to arise with the myriad things, I would be unable to know this. The myriad things arise from nature and return to nature, like blossoms and leaves that grow from the root and return to the root. Nature and mandate are the root of the myriad things. If one cannot return to one’s own nature, even ceasing movement and stilling thoughts to seek stillness is not true stillness. Only by returning to the root and recovering one’s mandate can one abide in profound constancy.\n\nNot taking the recovery of nature as illumination is merely worldly wisdom. Though one may call it illumination, it is not true illumination. Thus, moving with things, there is no action that is not reckless. Though one may gain something temporarily, the loss is far greater. When deluded by recklessness, one takes the self as right and others as wrong, treating all things as enemies. But if one knows that all is illusory, even enemies will be pitied and cherished—what could not be embraced? Then the feelings of self and other are exhausted, and whom would one favor? Without partiality, all becomes impartial. Impartiality leads to kingship, and kingship leads to heaven.}\n\nChapter Fifteen: The Highest Dao\n\nIn the highest antiquity, the people knew only that it existed.\nNext, they drew near and praised it.\nNext, they feared it.\nNext, they scorned it.\n{Alternative readings: \"knew not\" (Wu Cheng); \"next, drew near and praised it\" (Wang Bi); \"next, feared and scorned it\" (Kaiyuan Imperial Commentary); \"feared and then scorned it\" (Chen Xianggu).}\nWhere trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.\n{Alternative readings: Wang Bi adds \"here\" at the end of both lines; Fu Yi adds \"here\" to the first line only; Lu Xisheng’s version omits it entirely.}\n\nHow serene—its esteem for speech!\n{Alternative readings: \"leisurely\" (Wang Bi); \"some read *you* as *by*\"; Lu Xisheng omits *xi*; stele inscriptions read \"how it esteems speech\"; Fu Yi adds \"alas\" after \"speech.\"}\n\nSkillfully, affairs are accomplished and names are fulfilled.\n{Alternative reading: \"names are fulfilled.\"}\nThe hundred clans all say, \"We are so of ourselves.\"\n{Alternative readings: Fu Yi reads \"all say\"; Sima’s version omits \"all.\"}\n\nWhen the great Dao is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness.\nWhen wisdom and intelligence arise, there is great falsity.\n{Alternative readings: Fu Yi adds \"here\" after both \"abandoned\" and \"arise.\"}\n\nWhen the six relations are not in harmony, there are filial piety and compassion.\nWhen the state is benighted and disordered, there are loyal ministers.\n{Alternative reading: Fu Yi’s version reads \"filial sons and steadfast ministers.\"}\n\nCut off benevolence, cast aside righteousness—\nthe people return to filial piety and compassion.\nCut off sageliness, cast aside wisdom—\nthe people gain a hundredfold benefit.\n{Alternative arrangement: Most versions place these two lines above the previous two; this follows the *Yongle Encyclopedia* Wang Bi edition and Wu Cheng’s version.}\n\nCut off artifice, cast aside profit—\nthieves and bandits will be no more.\n\nThese three are deemed insufficient as cultural refinements. {Fu Yi’s version reads: \"are considered cultural refinements yet remain insufficient.\" Li Yue likewise reads: \"still insufficient.\"} Therefore, let there be that to which one may belong: manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce self-interest, and diminish desires. {The character 袌 is now written as 抱; they are ancient and modern variants of the same word.}\n\n{{Lu Xi Sheng states: The virtuous rulers of great antiquity acted without contrivance, leaving no trace. Thus, the common people merely knew of their existence. When virtue later declined, governance relied on benevolence and righteousness. The world, enveloped in their benevolence, grew attached to them; cherishing their righteousness, they praised them. When benevolence and righteousness proved insufficient to govern, penal laws were employed, and the people came to fear them. When penal laws failed to subdue their will, cunning and deceit became the norm, and the people scorned them. All this arose from the gradual erosion of sincerity and trust, leading to increasing disbelief. If, however, those above practiced the teaching of non-action and achieved success, the people would each follow their nature, all saying, \"I am naturally thus.\" Then the sentiments of attachment, praise, fear, and scorn would not arise in the world.}\n\nWu Cheng states: As in the saying, \"How precious is speech!\" The people unknowingly receive its blessings, all claiming, \"I am naturally thus,\" unaware of the ruler’s influence. This exemplifies the supreme state of \"not even knowing of its existence.\" That which is \"not even known\" is the Great Dao. Those who are attached and praise it rely on benevolence and righteousness. Those who fear it rely on wisdom. Those who scorn it engage in great falsity. From the Great Dao’s initial decline and further descent, these several stages emerge. Yet when the Great Dao declines and benevolence and righteousness arise, the transformation is still gradual. But when wisdom emerges and great falsity swiftly follows, the change is precipitous. The lines on the six relations lacking harmony likewise illustrate the consequences of the Great Dao’s decline and the rise of benevolence and righteousness.\n\nThe foregoing describes the descent of worldly change, revealing the origins of deviation from the root. What follows expounds the restoration of governance, guiding the gradual return to the source. \"Sageliness and wisdom\" refer to wisdom. \"Artifice and profit\" refer to great falsity. Abandoning the emperor’s benevolence and righteousness to return to the sovereign’s Great Dao restores the people to their original state—fathers kind, children filial—like the pure antiquity of old. Abandoning the king’s sageliness and wisdom to revert to the emperor’s benevolence and righteousness multiplies the people’s benefits a hundredfold compared to the king’s era. Abandoning the overlord’s artifice and profit to return to the king’s sageliness and wisdom—though not yet reaching the emperor’s time—ensures deep and far-reaching thought, well-ordered governance, and enlightened instruction, so that none will become thieves or bandits.\n\nThese three refer to the three matters of benevolence and righteousness, sageliness and wisdom, and artifice and profit. *Shu* (属) here carries the same meaning as in *Zhuangzi*’s phrase “attributing one’s nature to benevolence and righteousness”—that is, it denotes attachment. The Great Dao of the Sovereign possesses true abundance, while cultural refinement is insufficient. From the Sovereign’s era downward, there has been a gradual shift toward refinement, so each successive age regards the preceding culture as inadequate and attaches itself to what it esteems. Thus, through repeated changes, it drifts toward the superficial, unaware that the people of the Great Dao appear plain and embrace simplicity—nothing more than unadorned substance. In this state, they harbor few selfish desires; what need have they for refinement?\n\nAbove, it was said that when the six relations are discordant, there arises the practice of filial piety and kindness, yet here it speaks of the people reverting to filial piety and kindness. This is because when people are truly filial and kind, these virtues bear no name—such is the distinction between name and reality, culture and substance. Extending this principle, true benevolence and righteousness leave no trace of benevolence and righteousness, and true sageliness and wisdom bear no name of sageliness and wisdom—it is no different. When they appear plain and embrace simplicity, harboring few selfish desires, then “I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I have no desires, and the people become simple of their own accord.” This is the greatness of sageliness and wisdom, the perfection of benevolence and righteousness.\n\nAt the extremity of cunning and profit—\n\nMaster Li Jiamo said: When the Dao disperses, it descends and gives rise to falsity. When counterfeit prevails, there is a reversion to honoring the Dao. This descent marks the Dao’s subtlety; this reversion marks the extremity of decline.\n\nWhen the Dao has not yet dispersed, benevolence and righteousness lie hidden within it, undivided and unenumerated. But when it becomes warm and solicitous in isolated fragments, people cling to that warmth and solicitude as virtue—then the impartiality of the great Dao scatters. Moreover, if there are those of petty wisdom and shallow cleverness who usurp the semblance of benevolence and righteousness to act upon it, counterfeit flourishes from this, and disorder begins from this. This is what is meant by “descending and giving rise to falsity.”\n\nAs this reaches its latter flow, human counterfeits multiply, and none are without fault. Among the throng of faults, one who slightly distinguishes himself is then esteemed. Thus, only when the six relations are disharmonious does one recognize filial piety and kindness; only when the state is benighted and chaotic does one recognize loyal ministers. This is what is meant by “reverting and honoring the Dao.”\n\nWhen the Dao first disperses, people see its semblance and forget its wholeness. When it declines, nothing remains, yet they esteem its semblance. This is why things grow ever worse with each passing state.\n\nThus, Laozi teaches to sever the source of profit and unify it, returning to the root to rescue the branch—this is the essential point. For the benevolent do not regard themselves as benevolent; the righteous do not regard themselves as righteous. If benevolence and righteousness could be severed, they would not be true benevolence and righteousness. Great skill does not display its skill; exquisite profit does not speak of its profit. If cunning and profit could be severed, they would not be true cunning and profit.\n\nThe sage employs substance and does not take form; he teaches that what appears externally should have no shape. The multitude steals semblances to disrupt the real, so what appears externally becomes attached to something. The sage detests counterfeit for its power to disrupt the real, thus he seeks to sever its root source to remedy the ills of the latter flow. He would have the people of the world no longer borrow benevolence and righteousness while abandoning the substance of filial piety and kindness, harbor profit-seeking minds while usurping the conduct of sageliness and wisdom, employ thieves and bandits while forsaking the convenience of cunning and profit.\n\nHe leads only with simplicity and plainness, never displaying private desires to the people. When the people see him thus, they dare not deceive others with artifice, nor deceive themselves with artifice.\n\nWhen the *Heshang Gong* commentary treats \"I follow my nature\" and above as one chapter, and \"When the Great Dao declines\" as four lines in another, while \"Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness\" through \"without end\" as yet another, a closer examination reveals their meanings to be continuous without any new beginning. Thus, the *Yongle Dadian* edition following Wang Bi’s arrangement combines the latter two sections into one chapter—this is correct. Wu Cheng’s edition further unites all three into a single chapter, which better preserves the meaning. This approach is adopted here. As for the line \"Abandon learning, and there is no sorrow\" and what follows down to Zhang Junxiang’s commentary in the Tang, appended to the end of this chapter by Yao Nai—both the meaning and prosody are discordant, and thus not followed.\n\n---\n\nAbandon learning, and there is no sorrow.\nBetween \"yes\" and \"ah,\"\nhow far apart are they?\nBetween good and evil,\nhow great is the difference?\nWhat the ruler fears\ncannot but be feared.\nVast and boundless—\nhas it ever reached its end?\n\nThe multitude bustles and rejoices,\nas if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,\nas if ascending the springtime terrace.\nI alone remain still, without sign,\nlike an infant who has not yet learned to smile.\nAdrift, adrift—\nas if with no place to return.\nThe multitude all have more than enough,\nwhile I alone seem to have lost something.\nAh, this heart of a fool—\nso muddled and dull!\nThe common folk are bright and clear,\nwhile I alone am dim.\nThe common folk are sharp and discerning,\nwhile I alone am dull and confused.\n\nThe common folk—\nin the *Heshang Gong* version, \"the multitude\"—\nare sharp and clear, while I alone am dim.\nIn *Fu Yi*'s version, \"sharp and clear, anxious and troubled.\"\nSome editions add *jie* 皆 (\"all\") before both *zhao* 昭 (\"bright\") and *cha* 察 (\"discerning\").\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *zhao* 昭 may also be written as *zhao* 照 (\"illuminated\").\n*Ruohun* 若昏 (\"dim\")—\n*Wang Bi*'s version reads *hunhun* 昏昏 (\"utterly dim\").\n\nVast and indistinct, as if veiled in dusk—\n*Wang Bi* renders it: \"serene, as if veiled in dusk.\"\nThe *Heshang Gong* version reads: \"vast, as if the sea.\"\nThe Tang dynasty stone inscription from Yizhou reads: \"vast, as if dusk.\"\n(Note: Liu Xi’s *Shiming* explains: \"The sea is *hui* 晦 [veiled, obscure].\")\n\nDrifting, as if with no place to rest—\n*piao* 飄 (\"drifting\")—\nthe *Heshang Gong* version writes it as *piao* 漂 (\"adrift\").\n*Wang Bi* writes it as *liu* 飂 (\"swept along\").\nThe *Shiwen* notes: the Liang dynasty *Jianwen* Emperor’s version writes it as *piao* 飄 (\"drifting\"), while another variant writes it as *yuan* 渊 (\"abyss\").\nThe Ming dynasty *Jiao Hong* edition writes it as *ji* 寂 (\"still\").\n*Ruowu suo zhi* 若無所止 (\"as if with no place to rest\").\n\nThe multitude all have their means,\nwhile I alone am stubborn and coarse.\n(The *Heshang Gong* and *Wang Bi* editions add *er* 而 [\"yet\"] before *wo* 我 [\"I\"].\n*Si* 似 [\"like\"] is written as *qie* 且 [\"and\"] in some versions.)\n\nI alone differ from others,\nand value feeding from the Mother.\n(*Fu Yi*'s version reads: \"I alone *desire* to differ from others.\"\nThe *Kaiyuan* edition reads: \"value serving and feeding from the Mother.\"\nIts annotation states: \"The old text lacked *qiu yu* 求於 ['seek from']—these two characters were added by me.\"\n*Chao Yuezhi* notes that the *Minghuang* edition reads: \"The child values seeking food from the Mother\"—likely an error.)\n\nHere the preceding chapter spoke of the Dao of governing the state—only by cutting off sagely wisdom and cunning profit can harm be avoided, and thus it expounded the function of non-action. This chapter speaks of the Dao of cultivating the self—only by cutting off worldly, superficial learning can care be avoided, and thus it reveals the essence of desirelessness.\n\n\"Ah\" and \"alas\"—\nto the wilds, oh, never ending—\n\nThese seven lines describe how the world’s learners are beset by many cares. From \"The multitude all bustle and brighten\" through \"I alone seem forsaken,\" these eight lines describe how I desire nothing from without. From \"My heart is that of a fool\" through \"stubborn and coarse,\" these ten lines describe how I seek no knowledge within. The final line directly answers the chapter’s opening line: what is cut off is worldly learning, while what is valued is the learning of feeding from the Mother.\n\nFor care arises from fear. Those in the world who pursue learning merely believe that good surpasses evil, strutting about in self-satisfaction—yet in my eyes, they are no different from \"ah\" and \"alas.\" Why? If we examine the original heart of such people, do they truly delight in \"ah\" and suffer from \"alas,\" delight in good and suffer from evil? Between the two, how far apart are they? Only because others all say \"ah\" and \"alas\"—despising those who say \"alas\" brings humiliation, while fearing evil brings loss of reputation and invites punishment—are they thus compelled to fear the former and do the latter. Driven by helplessness, they spend their whole lives clinging to this care, and in the wilds, oh, where is the end?\n\nYet in the minds of worldly people, do they truly know their many cares? They surely believe they seek joy, busily chasing things with no lack of zeal. And do the hearts of worldly people truly consider themselves ignorant? They surely believe themselves clear-sighted, viewing me as muddled, foolish, dull, and coarse. Then how could I alone willingly debase myself and differ from human nature? I surely have what I value—it simply differs from others.\n\nVirtue is the Mother of the myriad things, and the Dao is in turn the Mother of virtue. The multitude chase things and enslave their intelligence to supply their seeing, hearing, thinking, and pondering—they merely feed on the child. I alone forsake and abandon these, savoring the Dao and virtue to nourish myself. Thus, cutting off the learning of care and fear is precisely what it means to value the learning of feeding from the Mother.\n\nYet Yang Xiong said: \"If a person cuts off learning, though free from care, how is he different from a bird or beast?\" How could he have understood the meaning of cutting off learning? In serene indifference, before emotions and desires arise, like an infant who cannot yet laugh or cry, one does not yet know that external things can bring joy. One rides along with things without clinging to them. The multitude all have the heart that seeks surplus and gain, while I alone abandon it. How could I truly be so foolish as to be so muddled? For the Dao delights in insufficiency, and the heart without surplus is why others seem clear-sighted while I seem dull. Thus, this heart drifts boundlessly, like a boat in the vast sea, floating without mooring—this is the meaning of \"riding along as if with no place to return.\" This is the function of having and acting.\n\n\"Stubborn and coarse\" is like a rustic from distant lands who does not know the capital. \"Feeding from the Mother\" is found in the *Neize* chapter of the *Record of Rites*—it refers to a wet nurse. To \"value feeding from the Mother\" is the meaning of an infant who cannot yet laugh.\n\nThe *Yao Nai* edition connects the opening line to the preceding chapter and further treats this chapter as continuous with the following one, interpreting \"唯之与阿\" as describing the seeker of the Dao and \"孔德之容\" onward as the reality of one who has attained the Dao. This approach is not adopted here.\n\nThe bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao. As a thing, the Dao is only dim and indistinct. Dim! Indistinct! Yet within it there are images. Indistinct! Dim! Yet within it there are things. Profound! Obscure! Yet within it there is essence. Its essence is most true, and within it there is reliability. From ancient times to the present, its name does not depart, by which we observe the origins of the multitude. How do I know the nature of the origins of the multitude? By this.\n\nThe great—this follows from the self. It speaks of the bearing of abundant virtue, which all emerges from within the Dao. Dim and indistinct, it seems both present and absent; profound and obscure, it is entirely beyond sight. These all describe the nothingness of the Dao. That there are things and images is the manifestation of virtue—yet these are but its coarser aspects. Virtue is the source of things and images, and what is most refined within it. As *Zhuangzi* says: \"Take virtue as the root, take the root as the essence.\" This speaks of virtue issuing from the Dao.\n\n\"Reliability\" means verification. \"Fu\" is a direct term of designation; \"the multitude of fu\" is like saying \"the multitude of beings.\" The *Guangya* states: \"Fu means multitude.\" Wang Dao says: \"The bearing of great virtue is precisely what follows the unmanifest and formless in the preceding chapter. The bearing of abundant virtue all emerges from the Dao—this is why the sage values 'feeding from the mother.'\"\n\nBelow, the text repeatedly describes the marvel of the Dao’s essence. \"Things\" are images; \"true\" is essence; \"reliable\" is truth. The variation in phrasing serves the rhyme. \"The multitude of fu\" refers to the ten thousand things of heaven and earth, all of which emerge from the Dao. While the multitude of fu undergoes transformation and flux, the Dao remains eternally unchanged. Thus it is said: \"From ancient times to the present, its name does not depart, by which we observe the multitude of fu.\"\n\nHow do I know that the multitude of fu is observed by the Dao? Precisely because the Dao embodies perfect truth and reliability, unchanging and indestructible, it eternally governs the myriad images, like an inn that hosts passing travelers.\n\nLi Jiamo says: \"The 'being' within being—all take it to be real, yet do not know it is entirely illusory. The 'being' within nothingness—what people do not perceive yet do not know is most true. Only because it is true and not false does it neither persist through being nor vanish through nothingness. This is called 'having reliability.' Unchanging and unalterable through the ages, this is how the sage can observe the beginnings of the multitude of beings and know the reason for their existence. By embodying perfect nothingness, one can observe the multitude of beings.\"\n\nYuan’s note: Jiao Hong takes *fu* to mean \"beginning,\" saying that observing its subtleties empties the later boundary, while observing the multitude of beginnings empties the earlier boundary. When the ten thousand things arise together and one observes their return, then all is emptiness. Yao Nai further suggests that *fu* refers to sages and worthies, who all share this Dao, allowing one to know that the state of former sages and later sages is as one. Both interpretations are plausible, yet they miss the original intent.}} Right, Chapter Eighteen.\n\nBent, one is preserved whole;\ntwisted, one becomes straight.\n{*Straight*: Fu Yi’s edition and the stele inscription read *upright*.}\nHollow, one is filled;\n{He Shang Gong’s edition reads *concave*; Gu Huan’s reads *sunken*.}\nWorn, one is renewed;\n{Wang Bi’s edition reads *obscured*; He Shang Gong’s reads *decayed*.}\nWith little, one gains;\nwith much, one is deluded.\nTherefore, the sage embraces the One and serves as the model for all under heaven.\n{In Fu Yi’s edition, the phrase *therefore* is omitted, and an *in* is added after *One*.}\nNot seeing oneself, one is thus clear;\nnot relying on oneself, one is thus distinguished;\nnot boasting, one thus achieves merit;\nnot being arrogant, one thus endures.\nOnly by not contending does nothing under heaven contend with him.\n{He Shang Gong’s edition reads: *Only by not being arrogant does nothing under heaven contend with him*.}\nWhat the ancients called “bent, one is preserved whole”—how could this be empty words?\n{In Fu Yi’s edition, a *thus* is added after *empty words*.}\nTruly whole, one returns to it.\n\n{{The *Zhuangzi*’s “All Under Heaven” chapter, speaking of Laozi’s teachings, says: “All seek fortune; he alone seeks to be preserved whole by bending.” Thus, this passage begins and ends with “bent, one is preserved whole,” for it does not desire to be straight, full, new, or excessive—all extensions of not seeking wholeness. *Bent* means bent in one part; embracing the One, one is thus bent, yet the whole virtue resides therein. That it does not say “with little, one gains much” but separates them into two phrases is to introduce the following idea of embracing the One. *One* is the extreme of littleness, yet embracing it as the model for all under heaven, one thus gains much. Those who lose their lives do so by pursuing many paths, and the sheep is lost on the branching roads—all cases of being deluded by much. The next chapter speaks of “serving as the model for all under heaven,” “serving as the stream for all under heaven,” and “serving as the valley for all under heaven,” all in parallel. *Model* refers to what the carriage leans upon; though lowly, it is respected—thus likening it to the sage’s empty and humble virtue. The eye is most clear yet does not see itself; if the eye were to see itself, it would no longer be clear. Human self-righteousness, self-importance, and self-boasting are all the same. Those who can do this have no other secret: embracing the One, there is no self; with no self, there is no contention. Only by not contending does all under heaven gladly defer and preserve one whole by bending. “Bent, one is preserved whole” was an ancient saying that Laozi transmitted, so he further emphasizes: *How could this be empty words?* It is indeed the effect of a true principle. For straight words seem reversed, and though none under heaven fail to know them, none can practice them. Who is the one who holds fast and remains unconfused? His admonition is most earnest.}}\n\n○ Su Zhe said: “Straight but not in accord with principle is not truly straight. Following principle, though twisted, is the utmost straightness under heaven. What gathers flows downward; though one may wish not to be filled, it cannot be avoided. Clarity and scrutiny are not the Way; dullness and simplicity, though worn, are the source of daily renewal. The Dao is merely the One. Gaining its root, one gains everything; pursuing many ends, one is deluded. Embracing the One is returning to one’s nature. Bent and whole, twisted and straight, hollow and full, worn and new—all are the overflow of embracing the One. Thus, it concludes with embracing the One. Not seeing oneself, not being self-righteous, not being arrogant or boastful—all are the overflow of not contending. Thus, it concludes with not contending.”\n\n○ Lü Huiqing said: “All things under heaven...”\n\nOnly water nearly approaches the Dao.\nFrom a trickling source, a swelling current,\nit ultimately converges with the sea—\nthis is how the bent becomes whole.\nAvoiding obstacles, ten thousand turns,\nyet it must flow east—\nthis is how the twisted becomes straight.\nExcelling in lowliness, the hundred valleys return to it—\nthis is how the hollow becomes full.\nReceiving all under heaven’s filth,\nyet none can purify it—\nthis is how the worn becomes new.\nOnly one who embraces the One can speak of this.\nThus it is said: “Little gained, much deluded.”\nFor it may bend or twist,\nmay hollow or wear,\nyet in all directions, nothing is not the One.\n\n○ Right, Chapter Nineteen\n\n○ Master Chao’s commentary states: *Yan Junping’s* Laozi Zhigui *and* Gu Shenzi’s *annotations differ considerably from other editions of the chapter-and-verse text. For instance, the passage beginning with “the bent becomes whole” is treated as seventeen characters belonging to the following chapter, among other variations. Master Yao Nai groups “those who force words are unnatural” and “one who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm” into a single chapter, noting that “wholly so” and “three” form a rhyme. He argues that one who truly possesses complete virtue will naturally draw all under heaven, thus requiring few words. The lines on “whirlwind and torrential rain” elucidate the meaning of “the twisted becomes straight” and “the hollow becomes full.” The passage beginning with “trust is insufficient” describes one whose inner deficiency compels an outward show of excess—this is the delusion of pursuing many ends. The interpretation, however, is somewhat forced.\n\nHere the text is not adopted.}}\n\nThose who are sparing of speech act naturally.\nA whirlwind does not last the morning;\nA torrential rain does not last the day.\nWhat brings these about? Heaven and Earth.\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot make them last long—\nHow much less can man?\n\nThus, one who engages in the Dao becomes one with the Dao;\nOne who engages in virtue becomes one with virtue;\nOne who engages in loss becomes one with loss.\nOne who is one with the Dao, the Dao also attains;\nOne who is one with virtue, virtue also empowers;\nOne who is one with loss, loss also attains.\n\nWhere trust is insufficient, there is distrust.\nOne who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm;\nOne who strides does not walk.\nOne who displays himself is not enlightened;\nOne who is self-righteous is not distinguished;\nOne who boasts achieves no merit;\nOne who is self-conceited does not endure.\nIn relation to the Dao,\nThese are like surplus food and redundant growths—\nThings that others may detest.\nTherefore, one who possesses the Dao does not abide in them.\n\n{{The preceding chapter speaks of the conduct embraced by one who possesses the Dao; this chapter speaks of the faults contrary to the Dao. Their meanings mutually elucidate one another. Observe the four phrases—“displays himself,” “is self-righteous,” “boasts,” and “is self-conceited”—which recur from the preceding chapter, yet here they are stated negatively, whereas before they were stated positively. To be sparing of speech and to merge with the mysterious is to act naturally. The whirling of wind, the torrentiality of rain, standing on tiptoe, striding, surplus food, and redundant growths—none of these are natural. Thus, words spoken in due time are not resented; rain that arrives in proper measure is neither too swift nor too slow. If one forces clever speech to astonish the world, it is like a whirlwind or torrential rain—impressive only for a fleeting moment.\n\nThose who engage in the Dao, virtue, or loss refer generally to people in the world who pursue learning, divided into these three types. To preserve the natural is called the Dao; to attain the natural is called virtue; to lose the natural is called loss. The term “one with” is akin to the *Book of Documents*’ use of “one with order” or “one with disorder.” “Attains” means “follows.” Whether one pursues the Dao, virtue, or loss is not inherently distinct from birth; rather, those who engage in learning achieve differing results, hence their classification by type.\n\nThe Dao is fundamentally natural, yet people often lose it through contrivance—nothing more than self-inflicted error. As Wang Bi said: “Take non-action as the ruler, do not take speech as the teaching, and things will attain their truth, becoming one with the Dao in substance.” Thus it is said, “One who is one with the Dao.” With fewer encumbrances, one attains and acts in accord with virtue, becoming one with virtue in substance. Thus it is said, “One who is one with virtue.” With more encumbrances, one loses and acts in accord with loss, becoming one with loss in substance. Thus it is said, “One who is one with loss.” This interpretation is close to the mark, yet many commentators force it into the meaning of the perfected person’s mysterious merging with things—an unnatural stretch. Only Fu Yi’s ancient text preserves the evident meaning.\n\n“One who is one with loss” is what is meant by “trust is insufficient.” “Loss also attains” is what is meant by “there is distrust.” When one’s sincerity is insufficient, others do not trust; when others do not trust, one clamors with words to confuse them—how then can one be sparing of speech and act naturally?\n\nWu Cheng said: “From ‘sparing of speech’ to ‘there is distrust’ clarifies the attainment and loss of the Dao. From ‘one who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm’ onward, human conduct is illustrated by analogy to the preceding. Standing and walking also arise naturally; if one seeks to add to the natural—standing on tiptoe, striding, increasing height, extending length—how is this different from whirlwinds and torrential rains that cannot endure? Those who inwardly harbor self-display and self-righteousness, and outwardly flaunt self-conceit and self-boasting, when measured against the Dao of the natural, are no different from surplus food or redundant growths—both are excesses beyond what is proper. Between the hidden and the manifest, there are beings that detest them.” (Here, “beings” includes humans, ghosts, and spirits.)\n\nSima Guang said: *Xing* (conduct) and *xing* (form) were interchangeable in ancient script. Discarded surplus food makes people disgusted; attached redundant growths make people find them ugly.\n\nLü Huiqing said: “The Dao abides where the multitude detests, hence it is said, ‘things may detest them.’ Therefore, one who possesses the Dao does not abide there. Why? The lowly, empty, soft, and weak are what the multitude detests and discards; the lofty, overbearing, hard, and strong are what the multitude detests and contends for. Thus, not abiding in either is the same in being without contention.”}}\n\n**Chapter Twenty**\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One**\n\nThere is a thing, chaotic yet complete, born before heaven and earth.\nSilent, oh! Vast, oh!\nStanding alone and unchanging,\nit circulates without cease.\nIt may be called the Mother of all under heaven.\nI know not its name—\nI style it \"Dao.\"\nForced to name it, I call it \"Great.\"\nGreat means passing on,\npassing on means going far,\ngoing far means returning.\nThus, heaven is great, earth is great,\nthe Dao is great, and the king is also great.\nWithin the realm, there are four greats,\nand the king occupies one of them.\nMan models himself on earth,\nearth models itself on heaven,\nheaven models itself on the Dao,\nthe Dao models itself on spontaneity.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six**\n\nWeight is the root of lightness; stillness is the lord of restlessness.\nThus the noble one travels all day\nwithout parting from the heavy baggage.\nThough there be glory and splendor,\nhe dwells serenely beyond attachment.\nHow then could the lord of ten thousand chariots\ntreat his own person as light before all under heaven?\nTo be light is to lose the root;\nto be restless is to lose the lord.\n\nWith heavy baggage, though one travels all day, one does not become light—why? Because weight is the root. With serene dwelling, though there be glory and splendor, one does not become restless—why? Because stillness is the lord. Thus to be light is to lose the root of weight; to be restless is to lose the lord of stillness.\n\nMaster Lü Huiqing said: All things that are light respond first; those that are heavy respond later. Thus the root can govern the branches. Stillness commands things; restlessness is commanded by things. Therefore stillness can lord over restlessness. Even in movement and dwelling, one cannot depart from this principle—how much less so for one who bears heavy responsibility and travels the long Dao to govern all under heaven, who could afford not to be still and weighty? To respond only after being moved, to act only when unavoidable—this is weight. To act as if not acting—this is stillness. If one’s movements are always in moments of unavoidable necessity yet cannot be without action, this is to treat one’s person as light before all under heaven and not as weighty. Without weight, one becomes restless and cannot be still.\n\nMaster Li Jiamo said: Traveling must include heavy baggage—this illustrates how the sage, though reaching everywhere in the course of a day, never departs from the root. Glory and splendor, serene dwelling—this illustrates how the sage, though doing all things, constantly practices non-action. If one who rules all under heaven merely drives oneself to the ends of things, then a single matter is enough to enslave them—how then could they firmly control all under heaven?\n\nMaster Wu Cheng said: \"To treat one’s person as light before all under heaven\" means to act lightly above all under heaven. Heavy baggage and serene dwelling are but one example. Whether in governing the mind, cultivating the body, managing the state by dwelling in weight to command the light, or in military strategy by using stillness to control movement—none depart from this principle.\n\nChapter Twenty-Two\n\nGood conduct leaves no tracks.\nGood speech bears no flaws.\nGood reckoning requires no counting rods.\nGood closure needs no bolt yet cannot be opened.\nGood binding needs no cord yet cannot be undone.\n\nThus the sage is ever skilled in saving people,\nand so there are no outcasts among them.\nEver skilled in saving things,\nand so there is nothing abandoned.\n\nThis is called inheriting the luminous.\n\nTherefore the good person is the teacher of the not-good,\nand the not-good is the resource of the good.\nNot to value one’s teacher,\nnot to cherish one’s resource—\nthough wise, this is great delusion.\nThis is called the essential mystery.\n\nChapter Twenty-Three\n\nKnow the masculine,\nyet guard the feminine—\nbecome the world’s valley.\nBecome the world’s valley,\nand constant virtue never departs,\nreturning to the state of infancy.\n\nKnow the bright,\nyet guard the dark—\nbecome the world’s model.\nBecome the world’s model,\nand constant virtue never falters,\nreturning to the boundless.\n\nKnow glory,\nyet guard disgrace—\nbecome the world’s hollow.\nBecome the world’s hollow,\nand constant virtue is fulfilled,\nreturning to the uncarved block.\n\nWhen the uncarved block scatters, it becomes vessels.\nThe sage employs it to become a leader of officials.\nThus the great system is without division.\n\nChapter Twenty-Four\n\nThose who would seize the world and act upon it—\n{I follow the reading with *zhe* (者).}\nI see they will not succeed.\nThe world is a sacred vessel, not to be acted upon.\n{Following the *Yongle Dadian* edition, which adds *ye* (也) after *qi* (器).}\nThose who act upon it ruin it;\nthose who grasp it lose it.\n{In the stele edition, both *zhe* (者) are replaced with *gu* (故).}\n\nThus things may lead or follow,\n{The *gu* (故) here is rendered as *fan* (凡) in Su Zhe’s edition.}\nmay warm or chill,\n{*Xū* (呴): the *Shiwen* and Wang Bi editions read *xū* (歔); another variant reads *xū* (嘘); Fu Yi reads *jìn* (噤).}\nmay be strong or weak,\n{*Léi* (羸): Wang Bi reads *cuò* (挫); Fu Yi reads *cuò* (锉).}\nmay bear or destroy.\n{*Zài* (載): Fu Yi reads *péi* (培); the stele edition reads *jiē* (接). *Huī* (隳): Fu Yi reads *duò* (堕).}\n\nTherefore the sage\neliminates excess, eliminates extravagance, eliminates extremity.\n{Jiaoshi Hong notes:}\n\nTo \"take\" here follows the sense in the *Zuozhuan*—\"taking our fields and dividing them into lots\"—and the *Records of the Grand Historian*—\"taking the High Emperor’s covenants and altering them at will.\" Yuan’s note: *qǔ* (取) is a grammatical particle. *Wéi* (为) means \"to act\"; *zhí* (执) means \"to grasp.\" For example, with pottery: if one does not follow its natural course but forces it to take shape, it will surely turn out flawed and ruined. Or with a treasure: grasping it tightly and refusing to let go, fearing its loss, may instead cause it to slip and fall. How much more so with the vessel of the world—the sacred vessel! The sacred vessel is Heaven’s mandate and the human heart, whose rise and fall are without constancy and cannot be contended by human effort. Thus it is called \"sacred.\" One who leads does not expect others to follow, yet they may follow of their own accord—this is how non-action does not fail to attain. One who exhales expects the other to receive, yet they may refuse and instead blow back—this is how action does not necessarily succeed. One may strengthen oneself to remain firm, yet at times grow weak. One may carry something in perfect safety, yet it may suddenly collapse. Thus, those who grasp do not necessarily avoid loss. Therefore, the sage in dealing with things eliminates excess and dares not overreach. In self-cultivation, the sage eliminates extravagance and excess and dares not overreach. Thus, the troubles of contention and overflowing fullness do not arise in the heart. Without scheming for things, things naturally come; without clinging to things, things naturally do not depart.\n\nBo Huihui said: All things have their own natural nature—how can one act to harm it? Thus, the sage eliminates excess, eliminates extravagance, eliminates extremity, only following their natural course. What the sage calls \"excess,\" \"extravagance,\" and \"extremity\" do not refer to the later ages’ ostentatious and excessive practices. Anything that adds contrivance beyond simplicity and ease falls into this category. The *Book of Han*’s *Biography of Huang Ba* states: \"In all governance, one must eliminate what is too extreme.\" Though the words derive from this passage, the meaning differs. If an affair is overly excessive, remove it; if it is minor and harmless, there is no need to alter it—this is the intent of the Han scholars. Things have their inherent nature and cannot be forced; affairs have their proper measure and cannot be exceeded—this is the original meaning of Laozi.\n\nLu Dian said: Eliminating excess is kindness; eliminating extravagance is frugality; eliminating extremity is not daring to put oneself first in the world. These three are how the sage comes to possess the world.\n\nLü Huiqing said: Laozi speaks of taking the world always through non-action. Non-action means following the self-so of the myriad things and not daring to act. Thus, one can win the hearts of the world and cause them not to depart—not through contrivance. Only the Dao can govern vessels. The world’s vessel is the sacred vessel; without the sacred Dao, there is no way to govern it. The sacred is without thought, without action. To act is to govern by means not of the Dao.

Other editions read: \"this is to position them according to the superior's power, then treat them with mourning rites.\" The Wang Bi and Heshang Gong editions omit \"according to the superior's power, then.\" This follows the corrected version.}\n\nWhen the slain are many, mourn them with sorrowful weeping.\n{The Heshang Gong and Wang Bi editions render \"many\" as \"the many.\" The Fu Yi edition adds \"then\" after \"many.\" \"Sorrowful\" is rendered as \"grieving\" in the Wang Bi edition.}\n\nWhen victorious in battle, treat them with mourning rites.\n{The Fu Yi edition adds \"one who is\" before \"victorious.\" Wu Cheng renders \"treat them\" as \"preside over them.\" Chao Yuezhi comments: \"Wang Bi's *Laozi* commentary.\"}\n\nThe passage from \"Weapons are inauspicious instruments\" to the end is not part of the original *Laozi* text. Wang Dao states: \"From 'Weapons are inauspicious instruments' onward, it appears that commentary and text are intermingled, likely due to ancient exegetical notes being mistakenly incorporated into the main text.\" Yao Nai remarks: \"The twelve characters 'When things reach their prime, they age' should be considered superfluous, as they belong below the line 'The heart that employs qi becomes rigid' in the lower chapter, and were erroneously inserted here under the 'Do not be forceful' line by reciters.\" Yuan’s note: Wang Bi’s commentary on this chapter is already lost. As Huang Sheng lived in the early Song dynasty, he was still able to see it. However, as the text has been transmitted for so long, we retain it here in its traditional form.\n\n---\n\nThe Dao of Heaven favors return. Thus, to rely on military strength to dominate the world is not the way of one who understands the Dao. He who assists a ruler through the Dao must not do so—how much less, then, one who rules by the Dao himself? Below, it exhausts the people’s strength, and thorns and brambles grow. Above, it violates the seasons of Heaven, and thus there are years of famine.\n\nThe so-called \"good\" refers to one who embodies the Dao. Arrogance stems from self-reliance; aggression from self-aggrandizement; and insolence from wanton excess. These three maladies share a single source. To know what must not be done and yet restrain oneself—this requires true resolve.\n\nThus, enumerating these instances where resolve is required serves to clarify. The character *er* (而) here should be read as *yu* (于). In ancient usage, *er* and *yu* were interchangeable, their sounds close and meanings akin. Others may act resolutely in that regard, yet I alone act resolutely in this.\n\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—this is the Dao of Heaven. To defy this is to act without the Dao. No wonder that which arises violently must perish early.\n\n{The character *jia* (佳) has no gloss as \"fine\" or \"excellent.\" Some suggest it is an abbreviation of *wei* (惟). Wang Shiqu notes that *jia* is a corruption of *fu wei* (夫惟), where the left component *xin* (忄) of *wei* was lost in transmission, leading scribes to miswrite it as *jia*. His argument is sound. Yet since the Han period, the phrase \"fine weapons are inauspicious\" (*jia bing bu xiang*) has existed, indicating that *jia* in this context is also an ancient reading. Others propose the gloss from the *Guang Ya*: \"wearisome\" (*jia lao ye*), which also fits the meaning. However, Fu Yi’s edition simply writes \"fine weapons\" (*mei bing*), suggesting *jia* is a loan for *jia* (嘉), aligning with the sense of the following text.}\n\nThe left pertains to yang and life; the right to yin and death. Thus, fortune and misfortune hold opposing values. *Tian* (恬) is not joy; *dan* (憺) is not richness—these refer to what the heart does not delight in.\n\n○ Li Jiamo states: \"He who kills another’s father will have his own father killed. He who kills another’s elder brother will have his own elder brother killed. This is called 'favoring return.' If by chance one’s weapons prevail, the vengeful qi they invoke cannot be made to flourish by earth, nor can it be accumulated by Heaven. Thus, the fate of those who do not prevail is self-evident. Therefore, the skilled warrior engages in battle only when unavoidable, acts resolutely in a single decisive strike, and does not thereby seek dominance. 'Resolute' (*guo*) means 'not enduring.' One inwardly maintains the mindset of necessity while outwardly committing to a single decisive action. Thus, one never boasts, never aggrandizes, never acts insolently, never seeks dominance—all arises from necessity. If one could avoid battle yet does not, weapons age and qi wanes, just as a person in their prime must grow old. Even those who act without the Dao do not live out their years—how much less the aging of weapons? From this, the way of the humane being without enemies can be known.\n\nTo speak of warfare, one must first take no delight in killing. Sun [Wu] and Wu [Qi] discuss strategy, examining emptiness and fullness, distinguishing the orthodox and the extraordinary—their words are exhaustive. Yet the root of emptiness and fullness, the orthodox and the extraordinary, Sun and Wu may not have grasped. Laozi says: 'Serenity and tranquility are supreme; victory is not fine.' This is his intent to avoid battle. Even from the perspective of military strategy, serenity and tranquility mean stillness, and stillness is the root of victory. Frenzy and agitation mean movement, and movement is the foundation of defeat. Mencius said: 'He who does not delight in killing can unify the world.' From ancient times to the present, has the Dao of Heaven ever faltered?\"\n\nThe Dao is eternally nameless. Though the uncarved block is small, none under Heaven can make it a subject. Should lords and kings hold fast to it, the myriad things will of themselves submit. Heaven and Earth unite to send down sweet dew; none command it, yet it spreads evenly of itself.\n\nWhen the first system creates names, once names exist, one must also know to stop. Knowing to stop is how one avoids peril. The Dao’s presence in the world is like valleys and streams in relation to rivers and seas.\n\n---\n\nThe Dao—this is the so-called eternal Dao. The Dao takes namelessness as its constancy, and thus can only be named by the nameless uncarved block. The uncarved block, as a thing, is neither carved nor polished; its essence is subtle and imperceptible, hence nameless. Yet at the beginning of Heaven and Earth, the myriad things rely on it to live—so who under Heaven would dare make a subject of that from which they are born and by which they begin? Should lords and kings hold fast to it, this is seeing the small and calling it enlightened, knowing to guard the mother while using the child. Guarding it to govern the myriad things, could any thing fail to submit? It is like yin and yang harmonizing to form rain and dew, nurturing the myriad things—though none commands it, it naturally spreads everywhere. When lords and kings grasp the guiding thread of the Dao, none command it, yet the myriad things submit of themselves—it is just like this.\n\nFor lords and kings to guard the uncarved block is to guard its namelessness. Guarding its namelessness, one can then establish names. To establish is to carve the uncarved block and divide it—rites, music, governance, and punishment all derive from this. Yet if one pursues the branches and forgets the root, one will drift ever farther and lose the source. Therefore, one must not over-rely, not seek excessively, but value stopping. To stop is to anchor with the nameless uncarved block. From namelessness one establishes names, so vessels come into being; returning with names to guard the nameless, the uncarved block does not scatter. How could one not know constancy and recklessly act, inviting misfortune?\n\nThus the Dao’s presence in the world is like water in rivers and seas: from root to branch, the branch never departs from the root. For lords and kings, can one not guard the uncarved block to govern things?\n\nWu Cheng says: The beginning is the Dao; names are virtue. The Dao’s namelessness becomes virtue, so names also come to exist. Those who use these names should know to stop at virtue, not pursue the branches and drift ever farther. \"Will\" means not being pressed by words.\n\nSu Zhe says: The uncarved block is nature. The Dao is eternally nameless, so as a thing it expands without limit and contracts without residue—this is why, though small, it cannot be made a subject. Thus even a commoner of lowly status, if he guards it, can mold Yao and Shun, while a lord or king of exalted rank, if he cannot guard it, will find the myriad things unruly. The ascending and descending of harmonious qi unite to send down sweet dew, moistening the myriad things evenly without exception. The sage embodies the supreme Dao to respond to all things—it is just like this. This is how he can make the myriad things submit. The sage scatters the uncarved block to make vessels and establishes names based on vessels—how could he pursue names and forget the uncarved block, be deluded by branches and lose the root? He also knows to return to nature, and thus rides the myriad changes without peril.\n\nLi Jiamo says: When Heaven and Earth unite, they send down sweet dew to give life to the myriad things. From this we see that though Heaven and Earth are divided, they need not be separate. Though the Dao scatters into things and things each have names, the Dao never abandons things. Only if things do not abandon the Dao themselves can they stand between Heaven and Earth without peril, for the Dao still gives them life. Thus if one knows to stop at the uncarved block, things will not be diminished by the Dao’s scattering, nor will the Dao be scattered by things’ arising—like the qi of valleys and streams, which never fails to flow into rivers and seas, and the qi of rivers and seas, which never fails to flow into valleys and streams. Root and branch never cease their daily circulation. Those who pursue branches and depart from the root—how could they understand this?\n\n---\n\nRight Chapter Twenty-Seven\n\nOne who knows others is wise; one who knows oneself is enlightened. One who conquers others has strength; one who conquers oneself is powerful. One who knows contentment is rich; one who acts with perseverance has resolve. One who does not lose their place endures; one who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\n\n---\n\nLü Huiqing says: Knowing constancy is called enlightenment, so enlightenment is surely what wisdom arises from. One who cannot turn inward cannot know constancy. If one can know constancy, what difficulty is there in knowing others? Guarding softness is called power, so power is surely what strength arises from. One who cannot master oneself cannot guard softness. If one can guard softness, what difficulty is there in conquering others? One with the enlightenment of self-knowledge knows that the myriad things are all complete within oneself and has no need to seek outside, hence is rich. One with the power of self-conquest diligently practices the Dao and is not hindered or swayed by external changes, hence has resolve. Knowing contentment within and acting with perseverance, one can preserve what one preserves and not be moved by things, hence endures.\n\nOne who can preserve what one preserves, though dead, has never truly perished—hence is called enduring in life. Master Zhang Erqi said: \"Wisdom and enlightenment, power and strength, are each spoken of in terms of inner and outer. Endurance and longevity are spoken of in terms of unchanging in life and imperishable in death. Not losing what one holds—even in death, not perishing—are all effects of guarding the constant Dao.\"\n\nMaster Li Jiamo said: \"Spirit and essence manifest externally as wisdom and power, internally as enlightenment and strength. What prevents people from entering the Dao is that their self-perception is unclear, and thus they are overcome by things. If one is inwardly enlightened, one naturally does not chase externals. Not chasing externals, one gradually gains the ability to overcome things. With the accumulation of days, one naturally enters the Dao. Knowing contentment, wisdom becomes ever clearer; acting with perseverance, power becomes ever more steadfast. Cultivation and awakening both perfected, one gradually returns to one’s nature. Emptiness within verifies fullness, and what is attained cannot be shaken—this is called not losing what one holds. Viewing death and life as equal, like morning and evening, without past or present, vast and constantly abiding—this is called longevity.\"\n\nMaster Wu Cheng said: \"The Dao of Laozi values obscurity as enlightenment and weakness as strength—why then does this chapter prize enlightenment and strength? It is because Laozi is not truly unenlightened within, but appears obscure outwardly; not truly weak within, but appears weak outwardly. His obscurity and weakness are remedies for governing externals; his enlightenment and strength are methods for guarding the inner. In truth, they are one and the same.\"\n\nChapter Twenty-Eighth\nThe Great Dao flows freely, turning left or right as it will.\nThe ten thousand things rely on it to live, yet it makes no refusal.\n{*Flows freely*: Fu Yi writes *fàn*; *to live*: He Shang and Wang Bi write *and live*.}\nIts work complete, it claims no possession.\nIt clothes and nourishes the ten thousand things yet does not act as their master.\n{*Claims no possession*: Fu Yi writes *and disdains [to claim]*; *clothes and nourishes*: Fu Yi writes *clothes and covers*, He Shang writes *cherishes and nourishes*—this follows the Wang Bi edition.}\nEver without desire, it may be called small.\nThe ten thousand things return to it yet know no master—it may be called great.\n{*May be called small / may be called great*: Fu Yi adds *yǐ* at the end of each phrase; *return to it*: Fu Yi writes *return to it*; *know no master*: Wang Bi writes *does not act as master*; *may be called great*: Wang Bi writes *may be named great*.}\nThus the sage never deems himself great and so accomplishes greatness.\n{*Fu Yi writes*: Thus the sage is able to accomplish greatness. *Because he does not deem himself great, he is able to accomplish greatness*. He Shang writes *never acts as great*; Wang Bi writes *because he never deems himself great*.}\n\n{*The ten thousand things rely on it to live yet it makes no refusal*: This speaks of the Dao’s expenditure—what is called its vast application. *Its work complete, it claims no possession*: This speaks of the Dao’s concealment—what is called its subtle essence. Precisely because its essence is subtle, it possesses the power to clothe and nourish the ten thousand things yet claims no possession, returning to formlessness and namelessness, gathering itself into something smaller than a hair’s tip. Precisely because its application is vast, the ten thousand things that rely on it to live all return to it in boundless abundance, unaware of its exclusive mastery, extending even to the point where all things grow together without harm—its capacity may fill the Six Directions. Thus, *ever without desire, it may be called small*: the uncarved block is small yet reveals the subtle—this is its essence. *The ten thousand things return to it, and it may be called great*: the ten thousand things come to submit of themselves, revealing the boundary—this is its function. When it is small, no trace of it appears; when it is great, nothing lies beyond it. Thus the sage who embodies the Dao is likewise: he ever guards the smallness of the uncarved block, refusing to deem himself great, yet the ten thousand things all return to him. From this we know that the Great Dao cannot be achieved by human effort. ○ Su Zhe said: That which flows freely, without fixed form or prohibition, is the Great Dao. The world has those who give life to things yet claim possession; those who shun merit yet refuse to give life. Only the Dao gives life without refusal, accomplishes without possession. If one is great yet harbors the mind of greatness, one is small. Lü Huiqing said: Only because its work is complete yet it does not dwell in it does it remain without desire—without desire is the utmost subtlety, and so it may be called small. Only because the ten thousand things rely on it to live do they turn and return to it, unaware of its mastery—this is the utmost capacity, and so it may be called great. Since it is small yet may be called great, and great yet may be called small, it cannot be named great or small. This is why the Dao is concealed in namelessness, and the sage embodies it through namelessness, never deeming himself great, yet nothing surpasses his greatness. For only because it may turn left or right is it neither small nor great; only because it is neither small nor great can it accomplish greatness.}\n\nChapter Twenty-Ninth\n\nGrasping the Great Image,\nthe world goes toward it.\n{Beneath the Great Image—Fu Yi’s edition includes the character *zhe*.}\nGoing yet unharmed, they rest in peace and tranquility.\n{*Pingtai*—the *Heshang Gong* edition reads *taiping*.}\nMusic and delicacies—\npassing travelers halt.\nThe Dao issuing from the mouth\nis insipid, without flavor.\nLook for it, yet it cannot be seen;\nlisten for it, yet it cannot be heard.\nIn use, it is inexhaustible.\n{*Chukou*—the stele edition reads *chuyan*. *Danhu*—Fu Yi’s edition reads *danxi*. *Bu ke ji*—Wang Bi’s edition reads *buzu ji*. In Fu Yi’s edition, *ting zhi yong zhi xia* all read *buke*. This follows the *Heshang Gong* edition.}\n\n{Wu Cheng says: The Great Image is an analogy for the Dao. The next chapter’s “Great Image has no form” refers to the Dao’s concealment in namelessness. Lin Xiyi says: The Great Image is the image of no-image. “The world goes toward it” means grasping this and proceeding, enacting it throughout the world. Lü Huiqing says: *Ping* is the utmost of peace; *tai* is the utmost of tranquility. “Peace and tranquility” means resting in equanimity. Li Jiamo says: The foolish go yet do not return; those with the Dao go yet are unharmed. Those who “go yet do not return” abandon the Dao to follow things. Those who “go yet are unharmed” move together with the Dao. Having joined with the Dao, going without departing from it, there is nothing not at peace, nothing not balanced, nothing not tranquil. In relation to forms and vessels, it is like a traveler’s temporary lodging. If, for the sake of music and delicacies, one lingers and does not depart, there is nothing that does not become a calamity. Thus the sage grasps the Great Image and proceeds, and though following things, constantly moves together with the Dao.}\n\nTo savor the flavor of flavorlessness,\nto see the color of colorlessness,\nto hear the sound of soundlessness—\nthus one employs the use of the useless.\nWithin the realm of forms and vessels,\nthe full function of the Dao is gathered.\nThis is how one attains peace, balance, and tranquility.\n\nSource’s note: *\"Grasping the Great Image, the world comes to you\"*—as in Master Wen’s *\"If you would use me,\"* meaning to proceed with this in hand. The sage possesses the Great Image: east or west, south or north, there is nowhere one cannot proceed with this. This is what is called *\"embracing the One as the model for all under heaven.\"* Wherever one goes, one rests in peace and tranquility without harm. Such is the inexhaustible function of the Dao.\n\nYet the Great Image is imageless,\ntranscending sound, color, scent, and taste—\nunlike the rich pleasures of fine music and sumptuous fare,\nwhich offer flavors to be savored,\nsounds and colors to be seen and heard.\nInstead, it is subtle and faint,\nthe use of the useless,\nwhose function is inexhaustible.\nOnly because it lacks the allure of intense delight\ndoes it also lack the peril of collapse.\nThose who indulge in ease and comfort\nwill inevitably suffer the harm of excess.\n\nTake music and food as examples:\nrefined music compared to lewd tunes,\nthe five grains compared to rich delicacies.\nThe bland harmonizes the heart and nourishes the person;\nthe rich unsettles the spirit and palls the palate.\nWhere there is desire, there is harm;\nits use must come to an end.\nWhere there is no desire, there is no harm;\nits use never ceases.\n\nThus, the flavor of flavorlessness\nis the supreme flavor,\nto be savored all one’s life without tiring.\nThe sound of soundlessness\nis the great tone,\nto be heard all one’s life without weariness.\nThe image of imagelessness\nis the Great Image,\nto be wielded all one’s life without harm.\nExtend this to the barbarian lands, and it may be practiced;\nrelease it to the four seas, and it holds true.\nThis is what is meant by *\"the world may come to you.\"*\n\nChapter Thirty\n\nWhen you would gather it in,\nfirst you must surely spread it wide.\nWhen you would weaken it,\nfirst you must surely strengthen it.\nWhen you would abolish it,\nfirst you must surely exalt it.\nWhen you would take it away,\nfirst you must surely give it.\nThis is called the subtle illumination.\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard;\nthe weak overcomes the strong.\n\nFish must not be removed from the deep abyss.\nThe state’s sharp instrument\nmust not be lent to others.\n\nAll things in their momentum follow this same principle, which aligns with the *Yi Jing*’s cycles of ebb and flow, waxing and waning. Some say that the phrase \"lend to others\" in the *Shuo Yuan* should read \"lend to people,\" for the art of expansion and contraction, opening and closing, is a method by which the sage eliminates violence and dissolves evil—yet petty men may also borrow it to pursue their private ends. The *Yin Fu Jing* states: \"Its mechanism of theft—none in the world can see it, none can know it. The noble man who attains it preserves his person; the petty man who attains it squanders his life.\" This is what is meant by \"not lending to others.\"\n\nWang Bi said: To remove the strong and violent and dispel chaos and disorder, one must employ these four principles in accordance with the nature of things, allowing them to destroy themselves without resorting to the force of punishment. Thus it is called \"subtle illumination.\" If you would fill it to its fullness, first let it expand to its limit. If you would expand it further after it is already full, the multitude will naturally contract. Should you attempt to govern it before its expansion is complete, its momentum will not have reached its peak, and you will instead endanger yourself.\n\nSu Zhe said: To take away without first having given is to act before the momentum is fully realized and the principle fully established. If the momentum is not fully realized, seizing it will be difficult; if the principle is not fully established, things will not submit. This is the profound investigation of the subtlest dynamics, no different from the methods of Guan Zhong or Sun Wu. The sage rides the principle, while the common world employs cunning. Riding the principle is like a physician’s skill in treating illness; employing cunning is like a merchant’s skill in pursuing profit. Thus, when the world’s strong and violent contend and clash, I alone meet them with softness and weakness. When the great are wounded and the small perish, I sit unmoving and await their demise. Does the sage intentionally act thus to overcome things? He knows the natural course of momentum and abides in its spontaneity.\n\nFish, as creatures, do not possess claws or fangs sharp enough to overcome other beings. Yet when they dwell in the deep abyss, even the strong and powerful cannot control them. The sage’s dwelling in softness and weakness, so that the strong and violent cannot harm him, is likewise. Not only can they not harm him, but he will ultimately preserve and control what follows. Is this not the state’s sharpest instrument? How could the multitude ever comprehend it?\n\nWang Dao said: Creation has its cycles of ebb and flow, waxing and waning; human affairs have their principles of fortune and misfortune, concealment and emergence. Thus, when things are about to become one way, they must have already been another. What will be has not yet taken shape, but what has been is already visible. To grasp what has been and thereby foresee what will be—this is the work of subtle illumination. Yet it must be subtle *and* illuminated; to make its subtlety *visible* is not permissible. Therefore, one conceals this principle to nurture oneself, remaining profoundly still, withdrawn, and yielding, at ease in oneself—like a fish that does not leave the depths. To flaunt this principle before others is to provoke conflict and invite trouble, to arm bandits and instruct thieves—like showing the state’s sharp instrument to others, which is improper. The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Robber’s Satchel\" chapter clearly expresses this idea. When the sage employs it, it becomes the great Dao; when usurped by villains, it becomes the tactics of vertical and horizontal alliances. Its words are sharper than blades. Thus, the sage does not display the sharp instrument to others.\n\nWu Cheng said: Laozi spoke of reversal as the movement of the Dao, calling its power \"mysterious and profound, distant, returning to the root of things.\" Its way largely opposes the common view, so he used these several examples of reversal as analogies, ultimately returning to the theme of the soft overcoming the hard and the weak overcoming the strong. Followers of Sun Wu and Shen Buhai, who employ such tactics to ensnare others in death without awareness, are often said to derive their ideas from Laozi. Thus, some claim that no one in the world would dare accept what Laozi offers. This is also a flaw in the way such teachings are framed. Therefore, \"the state’s sharp instrument must not be lent to others\"—Laozi himself has already made this clear.\n\nThe above is Chapter Thirty-One of the *Dao*.\n\n\"The Dao constantly takes no action, yet nothing is left undone.\nIf lords and kings can preserve it,\nthe myriad things will transform of themselves.\" {*Wei* 為 and *hua* 化 rhyme; *hua* is read as *e* 訛. \"Lords and kings\": Fu Yi writes \"kings and lords.\" \"If they can preserve it\": He Shanggong and Wang Bi write \"if they can preserve it.\"}\n\n\"Should transformation give rise to desire,\nI shall press it down with the nameless uncarved block.\" {After *zhen* 鎮, Jiao Hong omits the character *zhi* 之.}\n\n\"The nameless uncarved block—\nit too will be without desire.\" {All versions omit the character *fu* 夫; the *Shiwen* 釋文 writes \"not desire.\" This follows the Wang Bi edition.}\n\n\"Without desire, through stillness,\nthe world will right itself.\" {*Jing* 靜: Fu Yi writes *jing* 靖. *Zheng* 正 is sometimes written as *ding* 定.}\n\n{{Su Zhe said: \"The constant Dao\" expresses the meaning of \"nothing is left undone yet it takes no action.\" The sage transforms things through non-action, and the myriad things are transformed by it. It begins with non-action, but gradually gives rise to activity. This is like the growth of an infant—human artifice daily increases. Thus, the decline of the Three Dynasties and the changes in human nature grow daily more severe. When desire begins to arise...}\n\n\"And those above, together with all under heaven, are laid low—\nthus their transformations reach what cannot be fully expressed.\nIf, at the very moment when [desire] begins to stir, one does not move with it,\nand in the end subdues it with the nameless uncarved block,\nthen perhaps it may be halted.\n\n{{Lü Huiqing said: Laozi was a true person—\nhow could he have been so petty as to make the affairs of all under heaven and the myriad things his concern?\nYet why did he so earnestly exhort the feudal lords and kings?\nThe Dao, when cultivated in the self, is authentic;\nwhen cultivated throughout all under heaven, it is universal.\nIf the feudal lords and kings knew and upheld it,\nthen cultivating it throughout all under heaven—would this not be universality?\nNow, if one does not hoard the Dao but wishes to share it with all under heaven,\nthen none come before the feudal lords and kings.\nThis is Laozi’s benevolence.\n\nYuan’s note: From *'transformation gives rise to the stirring of desire'* onward,\ncommentators have largely missed the mark.\nFor *'the stirring of desire'* means the sprouting and stirring of desire.\nWhen the myriad things transform themselves,\none simply allows them to be born and to rest of their own accord.\nYet as they are born and rest of their own accord, the movement of qi daily trends toward refinement.\nThen, once more, the stirring of desire will arise within it.\nIf nothing is used to subdue it,\nthen the High Antiquity will descend into the Three Dynasties,\nand the Three Dynasties will descend into later ages—\nwho could halt this?\nYet how could subduing it involve any deliberate action?\nOne merely subdues it with the nameless uncarved block.\nThe nameless uncarved block—\nit subdues movement with stillness,\nhalts refinement with simplicity,\nand transforms artifice with purity.\nThus, though the stirring of desire may arise,\nit cannot take hold.\nIt will naturally dissolve and return to a state without desire.\nWithout desire, there is stillness;\nin stillness, there is rightness,\nand one returns to the nameless uncarved block.\nThis is what is meant by *'I am without desire, and the people of themselves become uncarved;\nI am fond of stillness, and the people of themselves become right.'*\nThe nameless uncarved block—\nrepeated for rhythm and to introduce the following passage.\n*'It too will be without desire'*—\njust as in the previous chapter, *'it too will know when to stop.'*\nBoth are unforced expressions.\nSome versions omit the character *fu* 夫,\nwhile others write *'not desire.'*\nThus, their explanations claim that even this nameless uncarved block\nis not something the sage desires to hold in mind.\nYet if it were something the sage did not desire,\nwhat would be the point of calling it the nameless uncarved block?\nThis contradicts the Chan school’s approach of sweeping away everything at hand—\nit is not the purport of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s naturalness and stillness.\nOnly Yao’s commentary states: *'It too will be without desire'* means causing all people to be without desire.\nThis interpretation is correct.}}\"\n\nThe above is Chapter Thirty-Two.\n\n**Higher virtue does not act as virtue—**\nthus it possesses virtue.\n**Lower virtue does not lose virtue—**\nthus it lacks virtue.\n**Higher virtue acts without acting, yet nothing is left undone.**\n**Lower virtue acts with effort, and there is something to show for it.**\n*(The line on higher virtue: Heshang Gong reads \"acts without acting and without anything to show for it.\" The line on lower virtue: Fu Yi reads \"acts with effort and without anything to show for it.\" This version follows the *Hanfeizi*.)*\n\n**Higher benevolence acts with effort, yet without anything to show for it.**\n**Higher righteousness acts with effort, and there is something to show for it.**\n**Higher ritual acts with effort, yet none respond—**\nthen it rolls up its sleeves and drags them along.\n*(The character 扔 is the same as 仍.

In both the upper and lower sections, he only uses 夫惟, never 夫 alone. Thus, 夫 is likely a mistaken interpolation for 失 \"lost.\" The phrase \"when ritual is lost\" forms a parallel with the earlier \"when knowledge arises,\" clarifying the meaning. It also aligns with the preceding sequence of lost benevolence and lost righteousness. Wang’s argument is sound.)*\n\n—it is the thinning of loyalty and trust and the beginning of chaos.\n**Knowledge that precedes things** is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of folly.\n*(The two particles 也 are present in Wang Bi’s edition.)*\n\nTherefore, the great man dwells in the substantial and not in the superficial,\nabides in the real and not in the flowery.\nThus, he rejects that and embraces this.\n*(Wang Bi reads: \"dwells in the substantial and does not abide in the superficial, dwells in the real and does not abide in the flowery.\" Fu Yi’s edition uses 处 \"dwells\" in all four lines. This version follows the Heshang Gong edition.)*\n\nWhere there is \"no *wei* (為),\" *wei* means \"to employ.\" *Rang* (攘) is an ancient form of *rang* (让, \"to yield\"). *Reng* (扔) is interchangeable with *reng* (仍, \"repeatedly\"). This speaks of yielding again and again before accepting.\n\nBenevolence, righteousness, ritual propriety, and wisdom are all lesser *virtue/power*, and thus all are spoken of as \"upper\" rather than \"lower.\" This is to push the distinction to its extreme and clarify their boundaries.\n\nUpper *virtue/power* approaches the Dao, and thus it is \"non-doing\" (*wuwei*) yet nothing is left undone.\nUpper benevolence approaches *virtue/power*, and thus it acts yet without *wei*.\nBy the time of righteousness, even its upper form is truly lesser *virtue/power*, and thus it acts with *wei*.\nRitual propriety is yet lower in *virtue/power*, and thus when one acts, none respond—one must repeatedly yield before accepting. This is the extreme of having no *virtue/power* while not losing *virtue/power*.\n\nWu Cheng said: In the first chapter of the *Laozi*'s upper scroll, *Dao* and *virtue/power* were spoken of separately but not yet clearly distinguished. In the first chapter of the lower scroll, *Dao*, *virtue/power*, benevolence, righteousness, ritual propriety, and wisdom are all delineated—this is the core of its teaching. Our Confucians take *Dao* and *virtue/power* as a single term; when spoken of separately, they become benevolence, righteousness, ritual propriety, and wisdom, all inherent in Heaven and originally present in human nature, with no distinction of refinement or coarseness. The *Laozi*, however, takes the Dao as nameless, while *virtue/power* has a name. From *virtue/power* to benevolence, righteousness, ritual propriety, and wisdom, each step descends further. Thus, in this chapter, *virtue/power* that nears the Dao is called upper *virtue/power*; benevolence that nears *virtue/power* is called upper benevolence; righteousness that nears benevolence is called upper righteousness; ritual propriety that nears righteousness is called upper ritual propriety. After ritual propriety, it speaks of \"prior knowledge,\" taking wisdom as the lowest. Its use of \"substantial and superficial,\" \"real and flowery\" is because the Dao is like the fruit of a tree—its vital principle lies within, its core hidden before sprouting. After sprouting, *virtue/power* is its root, benevolence its trunk, righteousness its branches, ritual propriety its leaves, and wisdom its blossoms. The Dao is the fruit, wisdom the blossom; the fruit is real, the blossom empty. The root is substantial, the leaves thin. Thus it says: \"Ritual propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust; prior knowledge is the flower of the Dao.\" The great man would rather hold to the substantial and real of Dao and *virtue/power* than abandon them for the flowery and thin of ritual propriety and wisdom.\n\nWang Bi said: The person of upper *virtue/power* employs only the Dao, does not *virtue/power* their *virtue/power*, holds no attachments, and makes no use of it. Thus, though they possess *virtue/power*, they have no name for it. The person of lesser *virtue/power* governs things through the name of goodness, and thus the name of *virtue/power* exists. When the name of goodness arises, there are those who do not respond, and thus they do not lose *virtue/power* yet have no *virtue/power*. \"Without *wei*\" means without partial action. Is not the greatest of all the Dao? When the Dao is lost, then comes *virtue/power*. The measure of lesser *virtue/power* reaches its limit at upper benevolence and stops. Though it employs *wuwei*, it cannot embody *wuwei*. Employing *wuwei* still grasps the mother, and thus one need not labor while things order themselves. Below this, one cannot practice *wuwei* and values broad giving; unable to give broadly, one values uprightness; unable to be upright, one values adorned reverence. Benevolence and righteousness arise from within, yet even when acted upon, they are artificial—how much more so when one strives for external adornment? Can this endure? The depth of benevolent *virtue/power* cannot be achieved by employing benevolence; the uprightness of righteous conduct cannot be accomplished by employing righteousness; the purity of ritual reverence cannot be aided by employing ritual propriety. If one grasps the mother of all efficacy, carries it with the great Dao, and stabilizes it with the nameless, then the mind has no schemes, affairs employ their sincerity, and benevolence, righteousness, ritual propriety, and reverence are all the Dao. If one abandons the mother to employ the child, discards the root to pursue the branches, then names have divisions, forms have limits. Though one may extend them greatly, there will inevitably be incompleteness; though one may amplify their beauty, there will inevitably be anxiety. This is what the highest does not accept.\n\nSu Zhe said: *Virtue/power* has upper and lower, but benevolence and righteousness have only upper—why? Lesser *virtue/power* lies between benevolence and righteousness, and what is below benevolence and righteousness is not worth speaking of. Those of loyalty and trust can study ritual propriety. When ritual propriety is established, the beauty of loyalty and trust radiates outward, but within, it is exhausted and nothing remains.\n\nThus, when those above act and those below do not respond, they resort to raising their arms to compel them. When compelled and still unanswered, punishments arise and weapons are raised—yet this is merely labor without method. This is the thinning of loyalty and trust, the beginning of chaos.\n\nJiao Hong said: The onset of chaos begins with folly—this is but an extreme exposition of the abuses flowing from ritual and wisdom. *Zhuangzi* cited these words of *Laozi* and expounded: What is concealed yet cannot but be done is *affair*; what is distant yet cannot but be dwelt in is *righteousness*; what is intimate yet cannot but be broadened is *benevolence*; what is measured yet cannot but be accumulated is *ritual*; what is centered yet cannot but be exalted is *virtue/power*; what is unified yet cannot but be transformed is the *Dao/Way*. Though these differ in rank and sequence, when the sage employs them, all are the *Dao/Way*. In this light, how could there remain any division of acceptance or rejection?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three**\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear;\nEarth attained the One and became tranquil;\nSpirits attained the One and became numinous;\nValleys attained the One and became full;\nThe myriad things attained the One and came to life;\nLords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.\n*(Fu Yi renders this as \"kings and lords.\")*\nTheir attainment was the same—One.\n*(Heshang Gong and Wang Bi omit \"of it.\")*\nWithout means to be clear, heaven would fear rending;\nWithout means to be tranquil, earth would fear eruption;\nWithout means to be numinous, spirits would fear exhaustion;\nWithout means to be full, valleys would fear depletion;\nWithout means to live, the myriad things would fear extinction.\n*(Yan Junping omits \"The myriad things attained the One and came to life. Without means to live, the myriad things would fear extinction.\"—fourteen characters.)*\nWithout means to be the standard, lords and kings, though noble and exalted, would fear collapse.\n*(Heshang Gong omits \"the standard and.\")*\nThus, nobility must take humility as its root; height must take lowliness as its foundation.\n*(Other editions omit the two \"must\"s. This follows the *Huainanzi* and Heshang Gong editions.)*\nTherefore, lords and kings style themselves \"the orphaned,\" \"the widowed,\" \"the unworthy\"—is this not taking humility as their root?\n*(Below \"style themselves,\" Heshang Gong adds \"saying.\" Fu Yi renders this as \"call themselves.\" \"Is this\" is rendered as \"is it\" in some editions; \"is it not\" is rendered as \"is it not so\" by Wang Bi.)*\nThus, to amass numerous carriages is to have no carriage.\n*(Heshang Gong renders \"carriages\" as \"chariots.\" Fu Yi renders this as \"to reach the utmost in praise is to have no praise.\" This follows the *Huainanzi* and Wang Bi editions.)*\nDesire not to gleam like jade nor to clatter like stone.\n*(Fu Yi renders \"gleam\" as \"mediocre.\" Both \"like\"s are rendered as \"as if\" in some editions. Wang Bi renders \"clatter\" as \"stubborn.\" This follows the Heshang Gong edition.)*\nReversion is the movement of the *Dao/Way*; weakness is the function of the *Dao/Way*. The myriad things of the world are born of *being*; *being* is born of *non-being*.\n*(Fu Yi renders \"the myriad things of the world\" as \"the things of the world.\")*\n\n*(Wu Cheng said: ...)*\n\nThe One is the virtue of emptiness and tranquility. The \"embracing the One\" mentioned earlier, the \"blending into One,\" and the \"Dao/Way giving birth to the One\"—all refer to this. Zhuangzi also calls it the Great One. This natural virtue in its function is empty yet not full, yielding yet not leading, soft yet not hard, weak yet not strong. The text repeatedly speaks of this, and this chapter fully reveals its essence. Those who attain it are said to have gained this One as their virtue.\n\nHeaven, Earth, the valley spirit, and the four are different in name but the same in reality. To split is to break apart. To emit is to discharge and shake. To cease is to dissolve and lose efficacy. To exhaust is to wither and lose fullness. To perish is to fade and lose life. To stumble is to fall. *Zhen* is the same as *zhen* (pillar); *zhen* is the backbone of affairs. \"To be the pillar of the world\" means to be the people’s ultimate standard.\n\nLaozi wrote this text to guide the world, so the following passage speaks specifically to lords and kings. First, he says that humility is the root and lowliness is the foundation, but later only mentions humility as the root—this is for brevity. The earlier passage on attaining the One already focused on the use of weakness, but at the end, reversion and weakness are spoken of in parallel. This is because reversion traces the origin of weakness, while weakness points to the reality of reversion. Whenever reversion is mentioned, it is to employ weakness; whenever weakness is mentioned, it is to oppose the movements and existences of the multitude. There is no reversion beyond weakness.\n\nThe stillness of the Dao/Way is fundamentally non-being, so its movement always opposes. The essence of non-being is emptiness, so its function always takes weakness as its affair. All things are born of *qi*, and *qi* is born of the Dao/Way. *Qi* takes form, but the Dao/Way is formless—this is why being and non-being oppose each other.\n\nWang Bi said: Purity cannot make itself pure, fullness cannot make itself full—they all depend on their mother to exist without form. Thus, purity is not to be prized, nor is fullness to be esteemed. What is prized lies in the mother, and the mother has no prized form. What is prized thus originates in the lowly. Therefore, to amass numerous carriages is to have no carriage. Jade and stone, gleaming and clattering, are entirely bound by their forms—hence they are not desired. The high takes the low as its foundation; the noble takes the lowly as its root; being takes non-being as its function—this is their reversion. When all movement knows its non-being, things flow freely. Thus, it is said: \"Reversion is the movement of the Dao/Way.\"\n\nLi Jiamo said: What is this One? To know why Heaven is clear is to know why Earth is stable. To know why the spirit is efficacious is to know why the valley is full. To know why the myriad things are born is to know why lords and kings serve as the world’s pillar. For in the end, all being arises from non-being—this is never not One. If one does not know the One, one must set oneself apart; setting oneself apart, one must cut off from things. If lords and kings cut off from things, things will also cut off from them.\n\nLi Zhi said: If lords and kings do not know the Dao/Way of attaining the One, they are no different from commoners. Thus, they inevitably exalt themselves by their nobility, and the exalted must stumble—for the high lacks a foundation. Only the low can be humble. Why? The principle of attaining the One means commoners are not lowly, nor are lords and kings noble. Consider how wheel, spokes, canopy, axle, crossbar, and yoke come together to form a carriage—people only see it as a carriage, not as the many parts that assemble it, for originally there was no such thing as a carriage. Extending this, lords, kings, and commoners—people only see their nobility and lowliness, highness and lowness, not knowing they all attain the One. Those who cling to the appearances they see and cannot humble themselves despite their nobility are merely gleaming and clattering like jade and stone. Thus, to know reversion and weakness, there is nothing more than attaining the One to reach non-being.\n\nChen Yidian said: \"Attaining\" is thus the utmost. To amass carriages is to have no carriage—from being, by counting, one reaches non-being. This is the utmost of humility. Gleaming and clattering both imply rigidity and inability to be soft and weak—this is the opposite of humility.\n\nYuan’s note: Zhuangzi described Laozi’s learning as establishing it on constant non-being and taking the Great One as its core, with softness, weakness, humility, and yielding as its outward expression. The \"attaining the One\" in this chapter refers to the virtue of emptiness and non-fullness, for it approaches non-being. It is also illustrated by lords and kings calling themselves \"solitary,\" \"widowed,\" and \"unworthy,\" for they approach the One. Heaven and Earth, the myriad things—all being arises from non-being. Thus, Heaven does not know its clarity, Earth does not know its stability, the spirit does not know its efficacy, the valley does not know its fullness, the myriad things do not know their birth—so too do lords and kings not know their nobility and highness. This is evident. Those who do not know their own clarity and stability...\n\nWithout intent it moves, without action it accomplishes. Those who do not know their own efficacy or fullness—are quiescent and empty. Those who do not know their own arising—are self-so. Those who do not know their own nobility and loftiness—are lowly and humble. Quiescence thus gives rise to efficacy, emptiness thus gives rise to fullness. Without intent and without action, clarity and stability arise. Self-so, they do not await birth yet are born. Self-lowly and self-humble, they become the standard for all under Heaven. This is what attaining the One brings about.\n\nNow, nobility and loftiness are the opposite of lowliness and humility—how then can they be unified as One? Consider lords and kings: they are seen as such only by others. If one traces this to its ultimate origin, accumulated lowliness constitutes nobility, and at the beginning of differentiation, there is no nobility to speak of. Accumulated humility constitutes loftiness, and at the beginning of differentiation, there is no loftiness to speak of. It is like assembling many materials to make a carriage—at the root of differentiation, there is no carriage to speak of. When there is nothing to speak of in terms of nobility or lowliness, loftiness or humility, how could it merely be that lowliness is the root and humility the foundation? Rather, even the self is dissolved. Without self, there is no other; without self and other, there is no loftiness or humility, no nobility or lowliness. In this way, loftiness and humility are One, nobility and lowliness are One, self and other are One. Wherever one goes, there is nothing—thus wherever one goes, there is the One. How then could this be contrary to the unyielding hardness of jade and stone, which set themselves apart from other things?\n\nYet what people perceive as opposition is the movement of the Dao. What they perceive as weakness is the functioning of the Dao. For movement arises from stillness, being arises from non-being. Not only does the form of a carriage arise from non-being—even the forms of Heaven and Earth, valleys, spirits, and the myriad things arise from non-being. Non-being and being are opposites, so those who embody the Dao are also opposed to those who cling to being. Those who cling to being are strong, while those who embody non-being are weak. Unable to embody non-being, they cannot even maintain softness. Thus, the difference between having a self and having none is what distinguishes attaining the One from failing to attain it.\n\nThe *Heshang Gong* edition divides the text from \"sparse and scattered\" onward as one chapter, and the four lines beginning with \"Reversal\" as another. However, upon examination, the following chapter speaks of \"being able to bear the nation’s filth\" as the master of the altars of soil and grain, and \"being able to bear the nation’s misfortune\" as the king of all under Heaven—immediately followed by \"True words seem contradictory.\" This chapter speaks of feudal lords calling themselves \"the orphaned, the widowed, the unworthy,\" immediately followed by \"Reversal is the movement of the Dao.\" This clearly demonstrates the continuity of meaning. Moreover, the passage on \"several carriages yet no carriage\" embodies the principle that \"being arises from non-being.\" Only when these are combined into a single chapter is the meaning complete. As for Wu Cheng’s proposal to merge the last four lines with the next two chapters into one, though the meaning may be coherent, the text itself is disjointed. Yao Nai, on the other hand, merges this chapter with the next, moving the twenty-five characters from \"The Dao gives birth to the One\" to \"the qi of harmony\" to the beginning of this chapter, and relocating the twenty-nine characters from \"Valuing the lowly as the root\" to \"Is it not so?\" above the line \"What people despise\" in the following chapter, claiming these are misplaced slips. Such conjectures are baseless and fail to grasp the fundamental purport of the *Dao* and *Virtue*.\n\nThe superior person, upon hearing the Dao, diligently practices it.\nThe mediocre person, upon hearing the Dao, wavers between belief and doubt.\nThe inferior person, upon hearing the Dao, laughs heartily at it.\nWithout such laughter, it would not be the Dao.\nThus, the established saying goes:\nThe luminous Dao seems obscure;\nThe advancing Dao seems to retreat;\nThe level Dao seems uneven.\n\nThe *Heshang Gong* categorizes thus:\n\nSupreme virtue resembles a valley.\nGreat purity resembles disgrace.\nAbundant virtue resembles insufficiency.\nEstablished virtue resembles indolence.\nUnadulterated truth resembles change.\nThe great square has no corners.\n\nGreat vessels are slow to complete.\nGreat sound is scarce of voice.\nGreat form has no shape.\nThe Dao and its virtue have no name.\nOnly the Dao\nexcels in bestowing and accomplishing.\n\nThe *Shuowen* states: \"a knot in silk.\" The *Zuozhuan* speaks of \"flaws in punishment,\" with the annotation \"unevenness.\" Wang Bi explains: \"The great, leveling Dao follows the nature of things, not clinging to flatness to carve them away.\" If a square does not align with the carpenter’s square, how can it have corners? If heaven’s countenance cannot be painted, how can it have form? Who but one who embodies the complete Dao could be thus?\n\nMaster Lu Xisheng says: \"That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel. The Dao is what transcends form.\" The superior person knows the subtle and the manifest, thus hearing the Dao, they believe and diligently practice it. The mediocre person stands between the subtle and the manifest, thus hearing the Dao, they waver between doubt and belief. The inferior person knows only the manifest and not the subtle, confined within form, thus hearing the Dao, they laugh loudly. To laugh at it is to reject it.\n\nThose of old who were adept in the Dao were subtly wondrous and profoundly penetrating, too deep to be known. If they were not laughed at by the inferior person, they would not be worthy of the Dao.\n\nMaster Li Jiamo says: \"The diligence of the superior person is not forced diligence; they act from insight. The laughter of the inferior person is not deliberate laughter; they laugh from lack of insight. If one neither attains the diligence of the superior nor the laughter of the inferior, unable to perceive yet also unable to trust what they perceive, they will remain in a state of uncertainty, neither present nor absent.\n\nOne who embodies the Dao is luminous of themselves, not by borrowed light; externally, none can perceive it, thus seeming obscure. One who advances in the Dao progresses of themselves, not by forced effort; externally, none can know it, thus seeming to retreat. The great white does not stain its nature; if its nature remains unstained, harmonizing with dust is permissible, thus seeming disgraced. Abundant virtue must be perceived in the great; if perceived in the great, even if one wished to halt it, it cannot be stopped, thus seeming insufficient. One who establishes virtue internally grounds their own nature, thus engaging with things must be simple, seeming indolent. One of unadulterated truth does not follow externals, thus they go where they will, seeming to change.\n\nIn this way, they cannot be examined by edges or corners, nor exhausted by what is complete or incomplete, nor known by sound, nor grasped by form or vessel. Those mediocre and inferior persons, bound by their own perceptions, judge the traces of the Dao as truly obscure, truly retreating, truly flawed, truly disgraced, truly altered. Few among them would not mock and ridicule.\n\nMaster Lü Huiqing says: \"Called luminous yet seeming obscure, called advancing yet seeming to retreat, called level yet seeming flawed—even to the point of supreme sound scarce of voice, form without shape, name and reality ever appearing contrary. Thus the reality of the Dao is concealed in nothingness. Precisely because of this, when one gives to others, one’s own abundance increases; when one bestows upon others, one’s own store grows greater. Extending one’s surplus to supply the insufficiency of things, none do not rely upon it to achieve completion in every curve.\"\n\nChapter Thirty-Five\n*(Wu Cheng’s edition combines the preceding line \"Reversion is the movement of the Dao\" and the following passage \"The Dao gives birth to the One\" into a single chapter, which is not adopted here.)*\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One,\nThe One gives birth to the Two,\nThe Two give birth to the Three,\nThe Three give birth to the ten thousand things.\nThe ten thousand things carry yin and embrace yang,\nBlending their qi to attain harmony.\n*(The Huainanzi reads: \"bear yin and [obscured] yang.\")*\n\nWhat people despise are only \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"unworthy,\"\nYet kings and lords take these as their titles.\n*(Fu Yi’s edition reads: \"What people deem misfortune, kings and lords use to refer to themselves.\")*\n\nThus, some things are diminished yet gain,\nSome are increased yet lose.\n*(One edition omits the character \"some\" in the second line.)*\n\nWhat others teach, I also teach:\n\"The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural end.\"\nI take this as the father of all teachings.\n*(Fu Yi’s edition reads: \"What others use to teach me, I use to teach others.\" It also renders \"father of teachings\" as \"foundation of learning.\" Wang Bi’s edition reads: \"What others teach, I also deem it right to teach.\")*\n\nThe softest under heaven\nRuns through the hardest under heaven.\nNon-being enters where there is no gap.\n*(Wang Bi’s edition omits the character \"in.\" Fu Yi’s edition reads: \"emerges from non-being, enters where there is no gap.\")*\n\nThus do I know the benefit of non-action.\nThe teaching without words,\nThe benefit of non-action—\nFew under heaven attain these.\n*(One edition omits the character \"I\" in the first line. Fu Yi’s edition omits the character \"also.\" The final line includes the character \"indeed.\" These four lines follow the Huainanzi.)*\n\n*(Wu Cheng comments:)*\n\nThis expounds in detail the application of weakness as the Dao’s function. All things arise through this. After the primordial qi gives birth, it must continue to employ primordial qi—only thus does it not lose the root from which it was born. Primordial qi is empty and never full, hence it is called “weak.” This explains why the Dao moves through weakness.\n\nKings and dukes style themselves “the orphaned,” “the widowed,” and “the unworthy”—this shows how one who embodies the Dao conducts themselves. Weakness entails reduction; strength entails augmentation. To augment oneself by overpowering others brings the reduction of an untimely death. Is this not what is meant by “augmenting yet reducing”? To reduce oneself through utmost softness and non-being yields the augmentation of swift movement and penetrating power. Is this not what is meant by “reducing yet augmenting”?\n\nThus, one ought to be weak, not strong. That strength and aggression serve as the foundation of teaching is self-evident without need for words—this is truly the teaching without words. The swift movement and penetrating power of utmost softness and non-being bring benefit in this way—this is truly the benefit of non-action. Compared to those who take verbal instruction as teaching and deliberate effort as benefit, how could they be mentioned in the same breath? Hence it is said: “Few under heaven attain these.”\n\nZhang Erqi says: This chapter follows directly from the preceding one, “Only the Dao excels at bestowing and completing.” The Dao gives rise to the One; the One gives rise to the Two.\n\nNameless—it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nTwo gives rise to three; three gives rise to the myriad things.\nNamed—it is the mother of the myriad things.\n\nThe One refers to *qi*. The Two refers to yin and yang. The Three refers to the *qi* of yin and yang in harmonious union—this is what is called the \"penetrating *qi*.\" The myriad things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang in their arms; through the penetrating *qi* they attain harmony. This further explains how the Three gives rise to the myriad things.\n\nSu Zhe says: The Dao is neither One nor Two. Yet when it pairs with things, the Dao is one while things are not one. Thus the Dao is named \"One.\" People of the world, not knowing the source from which the myriad things arise, all despise the few and small while prizing the great and weighty. Yet even the most exalted kings and dukes refer to themselves as \"the orphaned,\" \"the widowed,\" or \"the unworthy.\" The masters of the Dao in antiquity already understood this.\n\nJiao Hong says: All moving creatures have their backs turned toward the rear—this is the stillness of yin. Their ears, eyes, mouth, and nose face forward—this is the movement of yang. Plants likewise turn their backs to the cold and face the warmth. Thus it is said: the myriad things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang in their arms, while the penetrating *qi* circulates between them. In timber construction, a beam cut from waterlogged wood is called *liang*; the main beam supporting the ridgepole is also called *liang*—both derive their name from their strength. The *Inscription on the Metal Man* states: \"Those who are strong and aggressive do not meet a natural death.\" This saying existed in antiquity, and Laozi adopted it.\n\nThus it is said: \"I also teach this.\" The mother governs nurturance; the father governs instruction. Hence, when speaking of life, we say \"nourished by the mother\"; when speaking of teaching, we say \"instructed by the father.\" \"Driving and deploying\" describes their function. It does not say \"unyielding strength\" but \"utmost firmness\"—this is a shift in phrasing to match the rhyme.\n\nWang Bi says: Water flows without obstruction; *qi* penetrates without limit. Softness, weakness, emptiness, and nothingness—there is nowhere they do not reach. The softest cannot be broken; the formless cannot be exhausted. Extending this principle, we thus recognize the benefits of non-action.\n\nLi Jiamo says: When it is the Dao, even \"one\" has not yet arisen—how could there be two? Yet with the presence of yang comes yin; with yin and yang comes their interaction, and from this, nothing is absent. The myriad things embrace yang—this is one. They bear yin—this is two. Yin and yang interact, and the penetrating *qi* becomes harmony—this is three. What among the myriad things does not possess these three? Since they fundamentally arise from the Dao, their end does not lose their origin.\n\n\"Orphaned, widowed, and barren\"—these are the titles by which kings and lords refer to themselves. This is how reduction gives rise to increase. \"The strong and aggressive do not meet a natural death\"—this is how increase gives rise to reduction. Since reduction and increase share the same source, reduction must lead to increase, and increase must lead to reduction. The sage’s use of \"orphaned, widowed, and barren\" as self-designations is meant to teach people that aggression invites death. All of this serves as instruction.\n\nThings are not inherently things; firmness is an artificial state. Even the utmost firmness must ultimately return to nothingness. If the softest under heaven can drive and deploy the hardest under heaven, how much more can repeated reduction leading to nothingness shatter the artificiality of being? Thus, nothing can enter where there is no hearing. The action of non-action—its governance is through the Dao. The teaching of non-words—its instruction is through Heaven. No one has ever surpassed this.\n\nYuan’s note: The essence of this chapter, which reveals how weakness serves as the function of the Dao, lies entirely in the phrase \"the penetrating *qi* becomes harmony.\" For there is no penetrating harmony that is not soft and weak. Thus, in life, humans are soft and weak, while in death, they are hard and stiff. When plants are alive, they are soft and weak; when they die, they wither and dry. All perverse and disharmonious *qi* is hard and strong. Therefore, the life of the myriad things must never lose this harmonious *qi* to attain Heaven’s way of life. The opposite is the way of death.\n\nThe previous chapter stated that \"weakness is the function of the Dao\" and expanded on it with \"the myriad things under heaven are born from being; being is born from non-being.\" This chapter directly continues that meaning. Thus, in the text, whenever it speaks of \"those with abundant virtue,\" they are likened to \"the newborn child\"; when it speaks of \"focusing *qi* to utmost softness,\" it must be like \"the infant.\" All of this embodies the principle of valuing weakness as the essence of the Dao. Yet Zhang Erqi suspected missing text, and Yao Nai directly claimed it was a misplaced slip—both failed to grasp the thread of its discourse and the lord of its affairs.\n\nChapter Thirty-Six\n\n*(He Shang Gong divides \"Under heaven, the softest\" and below into a separate chapter. Now, examining the preceding text, the sections on decrease and increase are clearly demarcated, and the concluding phrase does not speak of \"non-action\" as a continuation. The meaning of the text is evident. Wu Cheng’s decision to merge them is correct. Furthermore, \"the lords and kings\" and \"orphaned, widowed, and lacking\" directly correspond to the beginning and end of the \"Attaining the One\" chapter, further proving that this and the preceding chapter both expound the meaning of the \"Attaining the One\" chapter.)*\n\nWhat is closer: name or self?\nWhat is greater: self or wealth?\nWhat is more harmful: gain or loss?\n\nThus, excessive attachment must lead to great expenditure.\nHoarding abundance must result in heavy loss.\n\nKnowing contentment avoids disgrace.\nKnowing when to stop avoids peril.\nThus can one endure long.\n\n*(The rhymes fall as follows: \"self\" [身] with \"close\" [親], \"wealth\" [貨] with \"great\" [多], \"hoard\" [藏] with \"loss\" [亡], \"contentment\" [足] with \"disgrace\" [辱], \"stop\" [止] with \"peril\" [殆] and \"long\" [久]. The first two lines place \"name\" above \"self\" and \"wealth\" below \"self\" merely for the sake of rhyme.)*\n\n*(Sima Wen Gong says:)*\n\nTo gain fame and wealth yet lose one’s self—\nor to gain one’s self yet lose fame and wealth—\nwhich is more harmful?\n\nWang Bi says:\nTo gain name and profit yet lose one’s self—\nwhich is the greater harm?\nExcessive attachment cuts one off from things;\nhoarding abundance refuses to distribute.\nThus seekers multiply,\nand attackers arrive.\nHence great expenditure and heavy loss.\n\nBo Hui says:\nOne who knows contentment delights in what is already abundant,\nfor they seek nothing.\nWith no seeking, how can there be disgrace?\nOne who knows when to stop fears harm in further advance,\nfor they recognize the subtle signs.\nRecognizing the subtle signs prevents the onset of peril.\n\nZhang Erqi says:\nThe greedy pursue wealth;\nthe ardent pursue fame.\nKnowing only name and profit,\nthey know not the self.\nYet weigh it carefully—\nbetween self and name or wealth,\nwhich is closer, which greater?\nExchanging one for the other,\nwhich is gain, which loss?\nThere must be those who can discern this.\nThus excessive attachment invites strife;\nhoarding abundance invites theft.\nOnly then do they awaken to fame as a burden to the self,\nand wealth as a thief to the self.\nYet the gain does not compensate for the loss—\nby then, it is already too late.\nOnly the noble person discerns this early,\neasily stopping, easily content.\nThus they avoid peril and endure long.\n\nYuan notes:\nThe passage from \"excessive attachment\" onward directly follows \"gain and loss\" to expound the principle of human worldly gains and losses.\nLü Huiqing’s division—assigning \"excessive attachment\" and \"hoarding abundance\" to fame and wealth, and \"great expenditure\" and \"heavy loss\" to the self—is overly contrived.\n\nChapter Thirty-Seven\n\nGreat perfection seems flawed,\nyet its use never wears out.\nGreat fullness seems empty,\nyet its use never ends.\nGreat straightness seems bent,\ngreat skill seems clumsy,\ngreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\n\nRestlessness overcomes cold,\nstillness overcomes heat.\nSerene clarity is the norm for all under heaven.\n\nWu Cheng notes:\nTo take perfection as perfection, fullness as fullness, straightness as straightness, skill and eloquence as skill and eloquence—this is small. To seem flawed is not perfection, to seem empty is not fullness, to seem bent is not straightness, to seem clumsy or inarticulate is not skill or eloquence—these are the greatness of perfection, fullness, straightness, skill, and eloquence. Generally, opposites complement each other in function, a theme recurring in previous chapters. Yang’s restlessness overcomes yin’s cold; yin’s stillness overcomes yang’s heat—this too is the interplay of opposites. \"Norm\" here is like \"ruler\" or \"lord,\" meaning the lord of all under heaven. Those who would be lords of all under heaven have much to do, yet those who exhaust themselves in action are less effective than those who practice serene clarity, who act through non-action and accomplish all. Thus they become the norm for all under heaven. Such is the movement of the Dao in reversal. Those who pursue the external and forget the root may now awaken.\n\nSu Zhe notes:\nStraightness without bend will break; following principle, even bent is straight. Skill without clumsiness will labor; entrusting things to their nature, even clumsy is skill. Eloquence without inarticulateness will fail; speaking from principle, even inarticulate is eloquence.\n\nYe Mengde notes:\nCold and heat are the qi of heaven and earth. If a person’s restlessness can overcome cold and stillness can overcome heat, how much more can the natural non-action of serene clarity govern the movements of all under heaven and uphold the One? Thus, flaw overcomes perfection, emptiness overcomes fullness, bend overcomes straightness, clumsiness and inarticulateness overcome skill and eloquence—all can be known from this. People of the world do not see this, striving to overcome things yet failing ever more. Serene clarity governs all under heaven by overcoming through non-overcoming.\n\nChapter Thirty-Eight (Note: Yao Nai moved the three phrases on \"stillness overcoming cold\" to the beginning of the chapter on governing the state. Others suggest these phrases belong to the following chapter, as \"dung\" [粪] rhymes with them, and \"the Dao being present, horses are sent back to fertilize fields\" is the effect of \"serene clarity governing all under heaven.\" This remains unresolved.)\n\nWhen the Dao prevails under heaven, warhorses are sent back to fertilize the fields.\nWhen the Dao is absent under heaven, warhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nNo transgression is greater than indulging desire.\nNo misfortune is greater than not knowing contentment.\nNo fault is greater than the desire to acquire.\n\nThus, the contentment of knowing contentment is ever content.\n\n(Commentary by Wang Bi.)\n\nWhen the Dao prevails under heaven, one knows contentment and knows when to stop. Seeking nothing from without, each cultivates only their inner self—thus, warhorses are sent back to fertilize the fields. When greed and desire know no limit, the inner self is left unrefined, and each seeks only from without—thus, warhorses arise in the suburbs.\n\nMaster Li Jiamo says: When the Dao is present, one can turn soldiers into farmers; when the Dao is absent, one can turn farmers into soldiers. \"That which can be desired\" is love. \"Not knowing contentment\" is taking. \"Desiring to acquire\" is possession. From love arises taking; from taking arises possession. This becomes an endless fault. Observe how those who do not know contentment, though they have enough, are never enough—thus it may be known that the contentment of knowing contentment is ever content.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine**\nWithout stepping beyond the door, one knows all under heaven.\nWithout gazing through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven.\nThe farther one goes forth, the less one knows.\n\nThus, the sage knows without traveling, names without seeing, and accomplishes without acting.\n\n---\n\nMaster Lü Huiqing says: What makes all under heaven what it is? What makes the Dao of heaven what it is? One who grasps their underlying principle knows and sees them without stepping beyond the door or gazing through the window. If one must go forth to know, how far can foot or eye reach? The sage knows what makes all under heaven what it is, thus knows without traveling. They see what makes the Dao of heaven what it is, thus name without seeing. Why is this? Because it is complete within them. Knowing what lies beyond where they travel, naming what lies beyond what they see—thus they accomplish without acting.\n\nMaster Li Jiamo says: Those who go forth to seek heaven and earth seek their form. Yet heaven and earth cannot be exhausted by form but can be exhausted by principle. Thus, the farther one’s use extends, the less one knows. If one knows that their principle lies within, even behind closed doors, it suffices. The sage knows that knowledge does not lie in form, thus need not rely on form. Names do not lie in traces, thus need not rely on seeing. Accomplishment does not lie in action, thus need not rely on acting.\n\nMaster Wu Cheng says: \"The farther one goes forth, the less one knows\" no longer speaks of seeing or gazing, for knowing all under heaven is knowing the Dao of heaven. \"Accomplishes without acting\" describes the effect of the two preceding lines.\n\nPursuing learning daily increases. Pursuing the Dao daily diminishes. Diminish and further diminish, to reach non-action. Through non-action, there is nothing left undone.\n\nThus, those who would take the world do so always through non-affair. When they engage in affair, it is insufficient to take the world.\n\n---\n\nMaster Li Jiamo says: Pursuing learning is to seek knowledge, thus it daily increases. Pursuing the Dao is to eliminate delusion, thus it daily diminishes. If diminution is not thorough, knowledge remains incomplete. Thus, diminution is the means by which daily increase is achieved. If one diminishes and further diminishes, delusion departs and truth becomes whole, then non-action is attained. When non-action is reached, then all that is done is never not without. Though one may possess the world, still one does not perceive the affair. If one seeks to take it through action, even a single thing cannot be obtained—how much less the world?\n\nMaster Jiao Hong says: \"Take\" is like transforming and governing. \"Non-affair\" is non-action. Through non-action, transformation occurs spontaneously; through tranquility, rectification occurs naturally. Thus it is said: those who take the world always do so through non-affair. Those who act ruin it; those who grasp lose it. Thus it is said: engaging in affair is insufficient to take the world.\n\nMaster Wu Cheng says: Following the principle of non-action and nothing left undone, it is said that those who took the world in ancient times did so only through the abundant virtue of non-action, to which people naturally submitted. If one must employ cunning and force, engaging in action, how could this suffice to take the world?\n\nMaster Kumārajīva says: \"Diminish\" means no coarseness is left unabandoned. Abandonment reaches the point of forgetting evil, then no subtlety is left unremoved. Removal reaches the point of forgetting goodness. Evil is wrong; goodness is right. Having diminished wrong, one further diminishes right.\n\nWhen passions and desires are severed,\nright and wrong are both forgotten.\nVirtue merges with the Dao,\nreaching the state of non-action.\nThough the self practices non-action,\nit allows the myriad things to act of themselves—\nthus there is nothing left undone.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-One**\nThe sage has no constant heart;\nthey take the hearts of the common people as their own.\nTo the good, I am good;\nto the not-good, I am also good—\nthus virtue is goodness.\nTo the trustworthy, I am trustworthy;\nto the untrustworthy, I am also trustworthy—\nthus virtue is trustworthiness.\n*(Wang Bi omits \"thus\" after \"virtue is goodness\" and \"virtue is trustworthiness.\" One version reads \"attains\" in place of \"virtue.\")*\n\nThe sage in the world\n*(One version includes \"of it\" after \"the sage.\")*\nshrinks and shrinks, blending their heart with the world.\n*(Wang Bi reads \"shrinks and shrinks\"; Heshang Gong reads \"startled and startled\"; the *Shiwen* reads \"tranquil and tranquil.\" One version adds \"thus\" after \"shrinks and shrinks.\" \"Blending their heart\" is rendered by Fu Yi as \"blending it wholly.\")*\nThe common people all fix their ears and eyes upon them,\nand the sage treats them all as children.\n*(The *Shiwen* reads \"coughs\" in place of \"treats as children.\")*\n\n*(Lü Huiqing says: ...)*\n\nThe sage is the first to fully realize the heart within me.\nThus, they have no constant heart but take the hearts of the common people as their heart—\njust as a mirror has no constant form but takes the form of what it reflects as its form.\nThe sage regards their own heart in this way,\nand so they regard the hearts of the common people likewise.\nThen, whether good or not good, trustworthy or not trustworthy—\nwhat constancy could there be?\nThus, to the good and trustworthy, I am good and trustworthy;\nto the not good and untrustworthy, I am also good and trustworthy.\nThis is because I know their hearts—good or not good, trustworthy or not trustworthy—are inconstant,\nand so I respond with virtue’s goodness,\nwith virtue’s trustworthiness.\nThat by which things attain life is called virtue,\nand virtue is the source from which the nature of things arises—\nthus, there is clearly no inherent \"not good\" or \"untrustworthy.\"\nTherefore, the sage’s way with the common people\nis to shrink and shrink, blending their hearts.\nTo blend their hearts is to ensure that the good and trustworthy do not set themselves apart,\nand the not good and untrustworthy do not abandon themselves.\nThe common people all fix their ears and eyes upon them,\nbut the sage alone perceives and listens as they do.\nThe sage meets them all with compassion,\ntreats them all with generosity.\nEven the not good and untrustworthy are still met with goodness and trust,\nfor the sage knows their hearts are as inconstant as their own.\n\nSu Zhe says: Were one to favor the good and cast aside the not good,\ntrust the trustworthy and cast aside the untrustworthy,\nhow could this be called \"constantly good at saving people, thus leaving none abandoned\"?\nThe world’s good and evil, trustworthy and deceitful,\neach side clings to its own rightness and condemns the other.\nThe sage, anxious and anxious, worries over this,\nand so blends their good and evil, trustworthy and deceitful,\nmeeting them all with the same response.\nThey fix their ears and eyes to observe the sage’s judgments,\nwhile the sage meets them all as infants—\nunmoved by goodness, unperturbed by evil.\nThus, the good do not grow proud,\nthe evil do not grow resentful,\nand all contention dissolves.\n\nChen Yidian says: Shrinking and shrinking.\n\nThe sense of unease.\nThe sage harbors no self-conceit or self-righteousness,\nand so ever bears a sense of unease.\nTo blend the heart is to merge all without distinguishing good from not-good.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two**\n*Emerging from Life, Entering Death*\n\nOf those who follow life, thirteen in ten;\nof those who follow death, thirteen in ten.\nOf men’s lives,\nthirteen in ten move toward the realm of death.\n{The third line, in Han Fei and Fu Yi’s versions, reads: \"Of the people’s lives, / those who live and move / all move toward the realm of death.\" The *Heshang Gong* version also reads \"thirteen in ten.\"}\nWhy is this?\nBecause they overindulge in the pursuit of life.\n{After \"overindulge,\" Fu Yi’s version includes the word \"also.\"}\n\nNow, those skilled in nurturing life:\non land, they do not avoid rhinoceroses or tigers;\nin battle, they do not don armor or weapons.\n{The character *bei* (被) may also be read as *bi* (避).}\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn,\nthe tiger no place to set its claws,\nweapons no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this?\nBecause they harbor no realm of death.\n{In Fu Yi’s version, after \"Why is this,\" the word \"also\" appears; after \"no realm of death,\" the word \"there\" appears.}\n\n---\n\n{Of all things under heaven, only life and death exist.\nTo emerge from life is to enter death.\nBoth are left to each person’s choice,\nyet in life, people move toward the realm of death—\nall depart from life and turn toward death.\nWang Bi says: \"Thirteen in ten\" means ten parts with three parts.\nThe Way of preserving life, the utmost of whole life,\nis thirteen in ten.\nThe Way of embracing death, the utmost of whole death,\nis also thirteen in ten.\nYet people, in their overindulgence in the pursuit of life,\ninstead find no ground for life.\nThose skilled in nurturing life do not take life as life,\nand so they harbor no realm of death.\nNothing harms more than weapons and blades;\nno beasts harm more than rhinoceroses and tigers.\nYet they find no place to lodge their blades,\nno place to set their claws and horns—\ntruly, those who do not let desire burden their bodies.\nHow could there be a realm of death?\nThe eel burrows in the depths,\nthe hawk and kestrel nest on the peaks—\narrows and snares cannot reach them,\nnets and traps cannot be cast.}\n\nThey may be said to dwell in a realm without death—\nyet in the end, by savoring the bait,\nthey enter a realm without life.\nIs this not the excess of \"pursuing life with life\"?\n\nThus, if things do not seek to depart from their root,\ndo not let desire corrupt their true nature,\nthen like an infant, venomous creatures do not sting them,\nfierce beasts do not seize them.\n\nWu Cheng says:\nTo emerge is life; to enter is death.\nEmergence means passing from non-being into being;\nentry means returning from being into non-being.\nZhuangzi says:\n\"All things emerge from the mechanism,\nenter into the mechanism.\"\nAgain:\n\"Their emergence brings no delight,\ntheir entry no aversion.\"\nAnd again:\n\"There is emergence, there is entry\"—\nall take emergence as life, entry as death.\n\nGenerally, if one does not harm the inner self with sorrow, thought, or craving,\ndoes not let wind, cold, heat, or dampness assail the outer self,\nand upon entering the world avoids the calamities of punishment, war, crushing, or drowning—\nthese three are the followers of life.\nTheir opposites—\nthe indolent and noble who harm themselves within,\nthe toiling and lowly who harm themselves without,\nthe coarse and reckless who do not fulfill their allotted span—\nthese three are the followers of death.\n\nChen Yidian says:\nThe \"realm without death\" refers to those who know the Dao:\nthey must penetrate principle,\nand those who penetrate principle must grasp adaptability.\nThose who grasp adaptability do not let things harm them—\nnot because they hold them in contempt,\nbut because they discern safety and danger,\nare cautious of fortune and misfortune,\nand thus nothing can harm them.\n\nYuan’s note on \"the followers of life\" and the three sentences:\nAll explanations are forced; only Wang’s is close, though his words are unclear.\n\"Followers\" here means \"category.\"\nThe followers of life, the followers of death—\nthis is like saying \"the Way of embracing life,\"\n\"the Way of embracing death.\"\nThese two together express the constant principle of life and death for all things between heaven and earth.\nYet those who live between heaven and earth\noften abandon the Way of embracing life\nand invariably follow the Way of embracing death—\nthis is the common flaw of those who cannot preserve life in full.\nThus, the next sentence begins with \"the life of people,\"\nwhile the two preceding sentences do not mention people,\nmaking clear that they broadly speak of the principle of things, not yet directly of the human body.\nThe next sentence does not repeat \"the followers of the realm of death,\"\nshowing that it generally continues the above,\nrather than listing three separate matters.\n\nSince people’s lives invariably lead to the realm of death,\nand it is said that \"thirteen in ten\" are so,\nreiterating the two instances of \"thirteen in ten\" from above,\nthe actual total of those who move toward death is nineteen in ten.\nThe Supreme One’s words are not urgent,\nleaving meaning beyond the text\nfor people to grasp on their own.\n\nAs for those who put themselves last yet find themselves first,\nwho set themselves aside yet find themselves preserved—\nentering the world or leaving it,\ntranscending the realm of death—\nthere is but one such person in all under heaven.\n\nHan Feizi’s citation—\n\"People’s lives: they live and act,\nand in acting all move toward the realm of death\"—\nthough not necessarily the original text,\nthe meaning is nonetheless clear.\nSome scholars claim that those who seek life yet turn toward death\nare practitioners of refining form and guarding life,\nand combine these with the two above as three matters—\nthis is forced and hard to reconcile.\n\nTheir discussions of the \"realm without death\"\noften adopt the Buddhist notion of the indestructible Dharma-body,\nwhich is incompatible with the Yellow Emperor and Laozi.\nThus, none of these interpretations are adopted here.\n\nThe Dao gives them life,\nvirtue nurtures them,\nthings shape them,\nand circumstances complete them.\nThus, the myriad things all revere the Dao and honor virtue.\nThe Dao’s reverence,\nvirtue’s honor—\nnothing commands this, yet it is ever spontaneous.\n\n{Some editions omit the word \"nothing\";\nFu Yi’s and the *Kaiyuan* editions render \"commands\" as \"enfeoffs.\"}\n\nTherefore, the Dao gives them life and sustains them,\nfosters and nourishes them,\nripens and matures them.\n{*Ripens and matures*: Heshang Gong renders this as \"brings to fruition.\"\nBi Yuan notes: \"Ripening, maturing—sound and meaning are akin.\"}\nIt nurtures and shelters them.\n{Nurtures: Fu Yi renders this as \"covers.\"}\n\nIt gives life yet does not possess,\nacts yet does not rely,\nleads yet does not dominate—\nthis is called profound virtue.\n\nThe term *ting* means to distinguish, to level, to equalize, and to harmonize. As noted in the *Yi* by Master Ma of the *Shi* hexagram.\n\n*Du* means to govern. Thus, giving life and nurturing is like spring; fostering growth and raising is like summer; maturing and governing to bring things to completion is like autumn and winter. Once their momentum is complete, one merely shelters and protects them.\n\nNone of the various commentators have interpreted *ming* as \"enfeoffment.\" Only Master Li has said that the Dao does not intentionally command things, which is a cause for concern in terms of meaning.\n\nMaster Lü Huiqing said: The beginning without name is the Dao. The One that has not yet taken form—what things receive to be born—is virtue. When it becomes a thing, it is merely shaped, not that by which it is born and nurtured. Once it has form, youth, maturity, old age, and death follow inevitably from its momentum. Thus, momentum arises from form, form from virtue, and virtue from the Dao. The Dao and virtue are the root; form and momentum are the branches. The root is honored, the branches humble; the root is noble, the branches base. This is how the soft and weak of non-action overcome the hard and strong of form. And it is in this, not in that, that kings and lords transform the myriad things.\n\nThus, when spoken of separately: the Dao gives life, virtue nurtures; things take form, and momentum completes them. But when traced to their root: giving life, nurturing, fostering, raising, maturing, governing, sheltering, and protecting—none of these are apart from the Dao. Yet the Dao ultimately has no name. Thus, it does not possess, does not rely, does not dominate—this is called profound virtue.\n\nMaster Zhang Erqi said: The form of things is merely the form of what the Dao and virtue give life to and nurture. The completion of their momentum is merely the completion of what the Dao and virtue give life to and nurture. Therefore, the myriad things all revere the Dao and honor virtue. How could this be something they await to make so? Thus, the Dao’s relation to things is ceaseless in giving life and nurturing, and further in fostering, raising, maturing, governing, sheltering, and protecting. Such is its merit toward things. Yet all arises naturally of itself.\n\nThe giving of life does not possess. The acting does not rely. The maturing does not dominate. How could this be fathomed?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four**\n\nThe world has a beginning that serves as the mother of the world.\nOnce one attains the mother, one thereby knows her children.\nOnce one knows the children, one returns to guard the mother.\nTo the end of one’s days, one will not be imperiled.\n\nBlock the openings,\nshut the gates—\nto the end of one’s life, one will not toil.\nOpen the openings,\nassist one’s affairs—\nto the end of one’s life, one will not be saved.\n\nSeeing the small is called clarity.\nGuarding the soft is called strength.\nEmploying one’s radiance,\nreturning to one’s illumination—\nno misfortune will befall the self.\nThis is called inheriting the constant.\n\nWang Bi states:\nThe mother is the root; the child is the branch. By grasping the root, one knows the branch—thus one does not abandon the root to chase the branch. The *dui* is the source from which affairs and desires arise; the gate is the path through which they follow. Without affairs, one remains ever at ease—hence to the end of one’s days, one does not toil. Failing to close the source, one cannot be saved to life’s end.\n\nThe efficacy of governance does not lie in the great. Seeing the great brings no clarity; seeing the small brings clarity. Guarding the strong does not make one strong; guarding the soft makes one strong.\n\nJiao Hong remarks:\n*Dui* is the mouth; the gate is the door of a household—both metaphors for that from which things emerge. To block and close them is to store being within non-being, to guard the mother. Radiance is the function of illumination; illumination is the essence of radiance. *Xi chang* means to inherit illumination, to keep it hidden and unexposed.\n\nZhang Erqi observes:\nThis chapter speaks of embodying the Dao. The beginning and the mother refer to the Dao; the child refers to the myriad things. To know the small and guard the soft is to guard the mother. Small and soft convey the meaning of *xi yi wei*—words that describe the subtlety of the Dao. What is seen yet invisible is the small; to see what is invisible is called clarity. What is guarded yet ungraspable is the soft; to guard what is ungraspable is called strength. Temporarily employing the outwardly manifest radiance, one later withdraws to return to one’s inherent illumination—without straying outward and failing to return, thus bringing no misfortune upon the self. This is to unite with the constant Dao.\n\nLü Huiqing states:\nHearing the Dao is easy; attaining the Dao is difficult. Attaining the Dao is easy; guarding the Dao is difficult. Now that I have grasped the mother and united with the heart-mind, I do not merely hear it—I know that all things under heaven arise from me. If I do not allow things to arise from me but instead guard it without loss, then who in the world could use what arises to harm its very source? This is why one remains unendangered to life’s end.\n\nTo block the *dui* and shut the gate is to guard the mother. When the heart-mind stirs within and one indulges it, this is called having a *dui*. With a *dui*, the heart-mind goes forth to engage with things; blocking it keeps the heart-mind from going forth. When things draw one outward and one accepts them, this is called having a gate. With a gate, things enter to disturb the heart-mind; closing it keeps things from entering. When the inner does not go forth and the outer does not enter, though the myriad things swirl chaotically before one, one remains unaware—how could there be toil?\n\nOnly by guarding the mother does one remain still and unmoving. In this stillness, one constantly perceives the heart-mind in the subtlest stirrings—hence clarity. Seeing it, one constantly guards it, so that with the formless and supremely soft, nothing can overcome it—hence strength. Having employed one’s radiance to perceive the subtlest stirrings, one returns to illumination to revert to stillness. To the end of one’s days, one never opens the *dui* or assists affairs to fall into irredeemable ruin—what misfortune could there be?\n\nThe above is Chapter Forty-Five. {Yao Nai and those after him place the fourteen characters \"使我介然有知\" in this chapter’s text, saying: \"Those who act block the *dui* and bequeath calamity to themselves—hence they are to be feared. If one is resolutely possessed of knowledge, one knows the child in order to guard the mother.\"}\n\n\"Were I resolutely possessed of knowledge,\nI would walk the great Dao,\nFearing only deviation.\nThe great Dao is utterly smooth,\nYet the people prefer byways.\"\n\n{Chen Jingyuan writes: \"the people greatly prefer byways.\"}\n\n\"The court is immaculate,\nThe fields lie waste,\nThe granaries are empty.\nThey wear embroidered robes,\nGird themselves with sharp swords,\nSurfeit on food and drink,\nAnd hoard excess wealth.\"\n\n{Fu Yi writes: \"excess goods.\"}\n\n\"This is called 'thieving ostentation'—\nHow could it be the Dao?\"\n\n{\"Thieving ostentation\": Han Feizi writes *thieving reed*. Note: in ancient rhymes, *yu* and *ma* were interchangeable, so *yu* and *kua* both rhyme. The *Shuowen* states that both *yu* and *kua* derive from the phonetic *kui*. In seal script, *yu* was written as *kui*, hence the graphical proximity led to error. Bi Yuan notes that in antiquity, characters with the *yu* phonetic all carried the sense of 'greatness.' Thus, the *Erya*’s *xu* and the *Mao Odes*’ *youyu* both denote 'great.' In clerical script, grass and bamboo radicals were indistinguishable, so Han Feizi’s *yu* should read *yu* (taro). Yet Han Feizi explicitly states, 'One *yu* sings, the multitude of *yu* harmonize,' making it clear the original was not *yu*. Still, the sense of *kua* (ostentation) coheres throughout the passage, so we follow the versions of Heshang Gong and Wang Bi.}\n\n{Wu Cheng comments.}\n\nThe term \"I\" here represents the self of the multitude. *Jieran* (介然) is used in the same sense as in Mencius, where it describes the formation of a path—referring to a fleeting moment. *Shi* (施) is akin to its usage in the *Analects* (\"without *shi* labor\") and in Mencius (\"*shi shi*\"), denoting an external imposition—here, self-aggrandizement and ostentation. The learning of Laozi most abhors exaggeration. This chapter speaks of those who do not know the Dao: by nature, they are bent on self-importance. If, in a sudden moment of insight, they act upon the great Dao, they will inevitably regard *shi* as something to fear and dare not engage in it.\n\nThe Dao is one of humble reticence. Its way is utterly plain and easy, yet people refuse to follow it. Ostentation and self-display are but narrow byways, opposed to the Dao, yet all delight in them. The passage beginning \"when the court is excessively adorned\" describes the affairs of ostentation. Thus it is said: \"ostentatious thievery is no Dao!\"\n\nChen Yidian states: \"To be cautious and dare not act is the great Dao; thus, arrogance and self-display are clearly not the Dao. The Dao of humility is so low that none can surpass it, yet people refuse to follow it. Outwardly, they may dazzle with ornament, but inwardly, they are hollow and empty. Though the court may be splendidly adorned, the fields and granaries are in truth barren and depleted. Still, they don regalia, gird themselves with swords, indulge in lavish feasts, and hoard useless goods, boasting of wealth and strength—like thieves who flaunt their spoils. How far removed are they from the great Dao that fears only *shi*!\"\n\nLü Huiqing says: \"To abandon the Dao and take the byway is to forsake the root and chase the branch. It is like a man who takes food as his foundation, yet food must come from the fields. When fields are well-tended, granaries are full; when granaries are full, food is sufficient; when food is sufficient, wealth abounds; when wealth abounds, the court is well-ordered. Thus one knows the source of the root. Now, if one does not follow the great Dao, failing to grasp the root and merely racing after its branches, how is this different from adorning the court while leaving granaries and fields empty, indulging in fine clothes and excess goods? What distinction remains?\"\n\nLi Jiamo says: \"To walk the great Dao is to be vast and expansive, the heart at ease and daily refreshed—thus, it is utterly level. To contend on narrow paths is to flaunt one’s wit and deceive others, the heart weary and daily diminished—thus, it becomes thievery. The world does not understand this: the court may be meticulously adorned, its outward trappings complete, yet the fields lie fallow and the heart remains untended; the granaries are empty and conduct goes unrefined. They deck themselves in finery to dazzle others, amass excess goods to no purpose—how far have they strayed from the Dao!\n\nYuan’s note: The Dao is greatest when it does not overflow. Not overflowing means focusing inward, having as if not having, being full as if empty. Now, if one engages in *shi* and ostentation, one busies oneself with externals, making nothing into something, emptiness into fullness—endlessly so. Human beings, once born, have desires, and none do not esteem one another as superior. This is the most difficult heart to overcome, with endless harms—is it not deeply to be feared? Yet people find the Dao of non-*shi*, with its restraint and difficulty, hard to follow. Instead, they seek quick gains and swift paths, competing for fleeting advantage. Do they not know that without self-importance or boasting, none can surpass them? The Dao is utterly plain—what difficulty is there in following it?\n\nTo call them 'the people' is to say they are benighted and ignorant, unaware of the great Dao, growing ever more ostentatious and ever smaller. Those who favor the great Dao see vastness; those who favor narrow paths see smallness. Seeing vastness, one is ever as if insufficient; seeing smallness, one is ever as if abundant. Such people, as scholars, will surely chase fame and neglect virtue; as commoners, they will surely indulge in excess and deplete the root; as rulers, they will surely adorn the exterior and hollow the interior. Though their depths and shallows, breadths and narrows differ, their subordination of self to others is one and the same. The most evident of these is the extravagance and decay of the state, easiest to perceive.\n\nHow severe is the difficulty of overcoming the human heart, and how fearsome is *shi*! The passage beginning \"when the court is excessively adorned\" is an extreme admonition to awaken the deluded. It is not merely that *shi* is to be feared in this one regard, nor is it merely a metaphor. Some scholars read *zhi* (知) and *xing* (行) together, or gloss *shi* as 'action,' while the *Hanfeizi* renders it as 'stealing *yu*.' All miss the original intent.\"\n\nThe well-established cannot be uprooted;\nthe well-embraced cannot slip away.\nThus descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\n\n{Cf. the *Hanfeizi*, which omits the two characters “者” and reads: “Thus descendants, through generation after generation, never cease their sacrifices.” The Wang Bi edition also includes “以” after “孫.”}\n\nCultivate it in the self—its virtue becomes authentic.\nCultivate it in the family—its virtue becomes abundant.\nCultivate it in the village—its virtue becomes enduring.\nCultivate it in the state—its virtue becomes bountiful.\nCultivate it in the world—its virtue becomes universal.\n\n{“拔,” “脱,” and “辍” rhyme; “身” and “真” rhyme; “家” and “余” (or “禽”) rhyme; “乡” and “长” rhyme; “邦” and “丰” rhyme; “下” and “普” rhyme—all in ancient pronunciation. Later editions, avoiding the Han taboo, altered “邦” to “国”; here, the *Hanfeizi* reading is followed. The Heshang Gong and Wang Bi editions include “于” after each of the five “修”; this follows the *Hanfeizi*, *Huainanzi*, and Fu Yi editions. Zhao Lijian alters all five “乃” to “能,” and “乃余” to “能有余.”}\n\nThus, observe the self through the self;\nobserve the family through the family;\nobserve the village through the village;\nobserve the state through the state;\nobserve the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\n{Fu Yi reads “何以” as “奚以.” The Wang Bi edition omits “之” before “然哉,” while the *Hanfeizi* renders “哉” as “也.”}\n\n{{All things under heaven.}\n\nThose who establish themselves upon externals—external things may seize and uproot them. Those who cling to externals—external things may seize and strip them away. Those who rely on what is external for their stability will find that such stability cannot ultimately be relied upon. But those who establish virtue and embrace the One—establishing it in the heart, embracing it within—initially bear no form of establishment or embrace. If I do not myself uproot or strip it away, who could uproot or strip it from me? Thus, it is not merely stable for a time, but remains stable for generations to come.\n\nThe way of the world in establishing and embracing is to scheme with cleverness and artifice, borrowing from externals what is not truly their own. The sage, however, cultivates only the virtue of his own person, and what is sufficient within requires no borrowing from without. This is the real. Taking what all people equally possess and preserving it alone—who is not encompassed within what is established and embraced? Extending this to family, state, and world, it is nothing more than the surplus of this virtue, lengthening, enriching, and universalizing it. Beyond this virtue, there is no other matter; beyond this reality, there is no other cultivation.\n\nWhy is it that the body of one person is the body of a family, a village, a state, and the world? The nature and feelings of ten thousand people are the nature and feelings of one body. If the virtue of my own person is cultivated, then observing others through myself, there is no difference between them and me. Thus, though the people of family, state, and world are not one, the body of that family is like the body of this family—observing the people of my own family is sufficient. The body of that state is like the body of this state—observing the people of one state is sufficient. Even the world of today is the world of antiquity, and the world of the future is the world of today. The same body shares the same virtue; the principle of their sameness cannot lie outside this to be known otherwise. It is obtained without going beyond one’s own person.\n\nThe ancients spoke of storing the world within the world—this is the Dao they employed. Thus, to speak of establishment and embrace without cultivation is not true establishment or embrace. To speak of cultivation without the person is not true cultivation. Cultivating it in the person, virtue becomes real. It is perfected therein.\n\nLü Huiqing said: Those in the world who speak of cultivating virtue often cultivate it in family, state, and world, unaware that its true root lies in one’s own person. Once the reality of virtue is cultivated in the person, it is simply extended outward. Zhuang Zhou held that the reality of the Dao is for governing the person, and its surplus is for governing the state; its dregs are for governing the world. This teaching arises from this principle. Observe it in one’s own person—what is surplus is already sufficient and requires nothing from without. Thus, observing family, state, and world is no different.\n\nThe right [text] is Chapter Forty-Seven. {Yao Nai separates the three phrases on \"good establishment\" into a distinct chapter.}\n\nOne

govern oneself,\npulses swelling and surging,\nexternally unable to restrain oneself—\nfar from the perfection of harmony.\n\nThings age when they reach their prime,\nfor their strength and rigidity violate the Dao.\nIf one abides in softness and knows harmony,\nremaining ever like an infant,\nthen one never reaches prime—\nhow could they age?\nNever aging—\nhow could they come to an early end?\n\nSu Zhe remarks:\nWhen Laozi speaks of the Dao and virtue,\nhe often compares them to an infant,\nalways referring to their essence.\nAn infant does not respond to things when they come—\ntruly, one cannot speak of its function.\nYet, free from desire, its essence is perfect.\nPeople first have a mind, then form;\nwith form comes opposition,\nand thus harm befalls them.\nThe infant, mindless,\nhas nothing to oppose—\nhow could it be harmed?\nWithout grasping, it naturally clenches;\nwithout desire, it naturally acts.\nIts essence is full, yet it is not the mind at work.\nWhen the mind moves, qi is harmed;\nwhen qi is harmed, one wails until hoarse.\nYet the infant cries all day and remains at ease—\nits mind does not move, and its qi remains harmonious.\nHarmony means nothing external harms the internal.\n\nTo know harmony is called constancy—\nresponding to things by preserving one’s root.\nIf one indulges life and directs qi,\nunable to follow nature,\nthey daily grow rigid and strong, and aging follows—\nthus losing the nature of the infant.\n\nLü Huiqing says:\nAt the beginning of life,\none’s virtue and nature are most profound.\nAs one grows,\nthe ears and eyes engage with the external,\nthe mind and consciousness receive internally,\nand indulgence in life increases daily—\nthus what was profound becomes shallow.\nThose who practice the Dao reduce what indulges life,\ncultivate nature, and return to virtue.\nWhen virtue reaches its fullness, it is like the beginning—\nhence it is said, \"One’s accumulated virtue is profound,\ncomparable to an infant.\"\nThe infant, as a creature,\nreceives the harmony of the primordial qi,\naccumulated and undispersed,\nand thus remains unharmed by things.\nHow much more so for one who guards the fullness of pure qi,\nwhose Dao is in great harmony with things—\nwhat could harm them?\nThus, attaining the ultimate of the Dao and returning to life is called constancy;\naccumulating profound virtue and knowing harmony is also called constancy.\n\nThe wise do not speak;\nthose who speak are not wise.\nBlock the openings,\nshut the gates.\nBlunt

heaven.\n\nBlocking the openings and shutting the gates\nspeaks of cherishing the body to preserve the self.\nBlunting sharpness, untangling knots,\nharmonizing light, and merging with dust\nspeaks of engaging with the world and responding to things.\nForgetting self and others,\nblending inner and outer—\nthis is mysterious sameness with the Dao.\n\nThose who have not attained mysterious sameness\nmay align with this but differ from that,\nmay align at the beginning but not necessarily at the end.\nWhen they align,\nthey are drawn near, benefited, and esteemed;\nwhen they differ,\nthey are kept distant, harmed, and debased.\nThe person of mysterious sameness\ndoes not align with anything—\nhow could there be what is called difference?\nThus, they cannot be drawn near or kept distant,\nbenefited or harmed,\nesteemed or debased.\n\nSu Zhe said:\nWhatever can be drawn near\ncan also be kept distant;\nwhatever can be esteemed\ncan also be debased.\nOne who embodies the Dao covers all things equally—\nwho is near, who is distant?\nViewing compliance and opposition as equal—\nwhat is beneficial, what is harmful?\nUnaware of honor or disgrace—\nwhat is noble, what is base?\nBeyond the reach of emotional calculations,\nthis is why they are honored under heaven.\n\nLi Jiamo said:\nBlock the openings to guard what emerges,\nshut the gates to bar what

beneficial does not rejoice,\none called harmful does not fear,\none called noble does not exalt,\none called base does not abase.\nThus, nothing in the world can compare to them.\n\nGovern the state

affairs, and the people enrich themselves.\nI harbor no desires, and the people return to simplicity.\n\nHis governance is unrefined,\nhis people are honest and sincere.\nHis governance is exacting,\nhis people are lacking and deficient.\n\nDisaster—where fortune leans;\nfortune—where disaster lurks.\nWho knows their ultimate end?\nIs there no standard?\n\nUprightness reverts to stratagem,\ngoodness reverts to perversity.\nThe people’s delusion has endured for long indeed.\n\nTherefore the sage is square but does not cut,\nhas edges but does not wound.\n\nThe Yellow River edition reads \"harm,\" while the Xue edition reads \"corruption.\" Here follows the *Huainanzi* version.\n\nStraight but not unrestrained,\nradiant but not dazzling.\n\n---\n\nMaster Wang Bi states:\nThose who would take the world always do so through non-action. When they act, it is insufficient to take the world. Thus, governing the state with uprightness is insufficient to take the world, and instead leads to the use of stratagem and warfare.\n\nGoverning the state with the Dao means honoring the root to still the branches. Governing the state with uprightness means establishing laws to attack the branches. When the root is not established and the branches are shallow, the people have nothing to reach for. Thus, many prohibitions arise, seeking to shame the people, yet the people grow only poorer. Sharp instruments seek to strengthen the state, yet the state grows only more benighted. When the people abound in cleverness, artifice arises; when artifice arises, perverse affairs emerge, until laws and decrees proliferate and thieves and bandits multiply. All this comes from abandoning the root to govern the branches.\n\nThus, uprightness seeks to still perversity, yet stratagem and warfare are employed. The sage practices non-action and absence of desire, and the people swiftly follow. All this means honoring the root to still the branches.\n\nWho knows their ultimate end—this absence of standard? It means: who can know the utmost of good governance? Only when nothing can be set right, nothing can be named, and the world is transformed in profound obscurity—this is its utmost.\n\nGoverning the state with uprightness thus readily reverts to the use of stratagem and warfare. This is establishing goodness to order things, yet it brings the calamity of perversity. For people’s delusion and loss of the Dao have endured long indeed; one cannot simply govern them with uprightness and demand compliance.\n\nTherefore, the sage guides things with squareness, letting them abandon their perversity, yet does not cut with squareness. He purifies the people with integrity, letting them abandon their corruption, yet does not wound with integrity. He guides things with straightness, letting them abandon their deviance, yet does not provoke them with straightness. He illuminates their delusions with radiance, yet does not expose their hidden faults with radiance.\n\nThis is what is meant by: \"Great square has no corners; great straightness seems bent; the luminous Dao seems dim.\" All this means honoring the root to still the branches, not attacking but restoring them.\n\n---\n\nMaster Wu Cheng states:\nGoverning the state with uprightness means using laws, regulations, and prohibitions to correct what is not upright—this is the way of Guanzi and Shang Yang. Using stratagem in warfare means employing deception rather than uprightness—this is the way of Sunzi and Wuzi.\n\nStratagem can only be used in warfare but cannot govern the state. Uprightness can only govern the state but cannot take the world. Only by governing the world with non-action does one not seek to subdue others, yet others naturally follow without exception.\n\nWhat, then, is the effect of governing the state with uprightness?\n\n\"Taboos\" refer to strict and dense prohibitions. \"Instruments of benefit and convenience for the people\" include such things as scales, measures, boats, carts, nets, and traps. \"Technical skill\" refers to the craft of creating useful implements—what is called \"excessive skill and extravagant craft.\" These eight lines speak of two matters.\n\nThe proliferation of taboos arises from the prominence of laws and decrees, which impoverishes the people below and may drive them to banditry. The abundance of useful instruments stems from the excess of technical skill, which muddles governance above and fosters the spread of strange and deviant practices.\n\nNow, regulating laws and refining tools, ensuring sufficient labor and ample utility—all aim at wealth and strength, the essential tasks of governing the state with uprightness. Yet the result is as described: even for governing the state, this is insufficient.\n\nWhat, then, is this \"non-action\" by which one may take the world? Non-action means loving tranquility and having no desires—all are forms of \"no affair.\" With nothing to attend to, how could one contrive to make the world incline and submit? Yet the people naturally transform and become upright, naturally grow rich and return to simplicity. Such is its effect—more than enough to take the world.\n\nViewed from these two perspectives, the governance of \"no affair\" may seem dull and unremarkable, yet the people transform themselves, remaining uncorrupted and pure. The governance of \"uprightness\" may appear discerning and impressive, yet below, the people are impoverished, and above, the state is muddled—things are false, people are disordered, and outcomes are uncertain, sometimes gained, sometimes lost. So contrary are they that one’s way of acting becomes clear.\n\nWhat is called misfortune may not ultimately be misfortune, and what is called fortune may not ultimately be fortune. Who can know where their ultimate ends lie? For uprightness and its opposite stand in contrast: when uprightness reverses, it becomes the perverse oddity of non-uprightness. Uprightness is deemed good, while oddity is deemed ill—thus calamity arises. Yet if there were no such thing as \"upright,\" there would be no such thing as \"good,\" nor would it reverse into the perverse oddity of calamity. Ordinary people, long deluded, have forgotten this principle. Thus they know only that governing through uprightness is good, unaware that what is called \"upright\" is no uprightness at all. Who but those who embody the Dao can understand this?\n\nThose who embody the Dao take \"no affair\" as their affair. Thus they take formlessness as form, unscrupulousness as scrupulousness, crookedness as straightness, and dullness as brilliance. In their encounters with things, their edges and sharp corners are concealed, their brilliance hidden and veiled. They move without harming others, possessing the benefits of goodness without its flaws. Though they never seek to take the world, the principle by which the world may be taken lies within them.\n\nMaster Lü’s disciple Huìqīng said: \"Governing a state with cleverness is the state’s ruin; governing without cleverness is the state’s blessing.\" Thus it is clear that \"having affairs\" is insufficient to take the world. How do we know that \"no affair\" suffices to take the world? We know it precisely because \"having affairs\" is insufficient.\n\nWhen rulers deem themselves upright, the people grow poorer, the state more muddled, and customs more extravagant—this is why laws and decrees proliferate and bandits multiply. All these are the faults of taking the world through \"having affairs.\" But when the sage practices non-action, the people transform themselves, free from the harm of taboos. When the ruler favors tranquility, the people naturally become upright, free from the harm of laws and bandits. When the ruler has no affairs, the people naturally grow rich, free from the confusion of sharp implements. When the ruler has no desires, the people naturally return to simplicity, free from the pursuit of cunning and perversity.\n\nThus, in taking the world through \"no affair,\" governance is dull and unremarkable, not delighting in sharp discernment. The people, too, remain simple and uncorrupted by shallowness. But in governing with cleverness and taking the world through \"having affairs,\" governance becomes sharply discerning, the opposite of dullness. Thus the people become fragmented and fail to preserve their simplicity. Sharp discernment and fragmentation mean fleeing misfortune without certainty of escape, seeking fortune without certainty of attainment. What is deemed upright and good may at times become perverse and calamitous. Misfortune and fortune, perversity and uprightness, good and ill—who can truly know where they reside? All that results is an excess of cleverness, making governance difficult.\n\nSince people first gained knowledge, they have long been deluded and obstinate. How can they be further burdened with sharply discerning governance, preventing them from returning to simplicity and preserving their nature? Therefore, the sage reverses course, taking non-action as the foundation.\n\nThe *Heshang Gong* edition separates the passage beginning with \"its governance is muddled\" into a distinct chapter, while Wu Cheng's edition combines them. Wang Bi's commentary treats \"uprightness reverting to perversity\" as a continuation of the opening line, likewise not considering them two separate matters.\n\nIn governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality. Only through frugality can one attain early compliance. Early compliance is called the repeated accumulation of virtue. With repeated accumulation of virtue, there is nothing one cannot overcome. With nothing one cannot overcome, none can fathom one's limits. When none can fathom one's limits, one may possess the state. Possessing the state's generative power, one may endure long. This is called the Dao of deep roots and firm foundations, of long life and enduring vision.\n\nThe study of Laozi is characterized by humility, modesty, frugality, and thrift—utterly unwilling to expend one's spirit. \"Early compliance is called the repeated accumulation of virtue\" means that one has already accumulated something early on, and by further nurturing it with thrift, one adds to this accumulation. If one waits until depletion has already occurred before nurturing, then nurturing merely suffices to replenish what was lost, and cannot be called \"repeated accumulation.\" The value of early compliance lies in early awareness of what has not yet been depleted, and conserving it.\n\nYao Nai said: \"Compliance (*fu*) means affairs. Thrift means having leisure in time and surplus in strength, thus enabling one to engage with affairs before they arise, accumulating virtue in advance. By the time affairs arrive, there is nothing one cannot overcome.\" Li Jiamo said: \"Externally in governing people and internally in serving Heaven, nothing surpasses thrift. Thrift means being thrifty in all things. Be vigilant within and composed without; the inner mind does not wander, and outer desires do not stir. Thus one can attain early compliance, and virtue accumulates day by day. Accumulating what is not seen as accumulation leads to overcoming all; overcoming all leads to governing all. Even possessing the state is possible. People know that one possesses the state but do not know that one can possess the state because of its root. When the root's accumulation is deep, who can fathom its limits? This is why it endures long and is not imperiled.\"\n\nLü Huiqing said: \"Human life is inherently sufficient in virtue. If one truly practices thrift and attains early compliance, then virtue daily fills to abundance—what is this if not the repeated accumulation of virtue? When virtue reaches its utmost, nothing can harm it; nothing under Heaven can overcome it. Where then is there anything one cannot conquer? With nothing unconquerable and none able to fathom one's limits, one becomes the master of things without being mastered by them. How could one not possess the state? Having attained the mother, one knows the child; knowing the child, one again guards the mother. Thus one remains unharmed throughout life and may endure long. Spirit is the root and foundation of life. By conserving and storing it, protecting and preserving it, the root and foundation grow deep and firm, and life flourishes. With flourishing life, one's vision endures long.\"\n\nSu Zhe said: \"All things, when square, cut; when sharp, wound; when straight, extend wantonly; when bright, dazzle. The sage possesses abilities but does not exhaust their use—thrift means having yet not using. By restraining and concealing one's capacities, even unto death without ever employing them, virtue is repeatedly accumulated. When virtue's accumulation is deep, even the world's hardness and strength cannot overcome it, and things cannot gauge one's measure. Only then can one possess the state, for one is able to guard the mother. Mencius said: 'Preserve one's mind and nourish one's nature—this is how one serves Heaven.' Thus, using thrift to govern people enables one to possess the state, while using thrift to serve Heaven means deep roots and firm foundations. The utmost persons of antiquity preserved the constancy of their nature and life, not depleting the inner through the outer. Thus their roots grew deep and unshakable, their foundations firm and inseparable. Even long life and enduring vision are possible.\"\n\nYuan's note: Many interpretations of this chapter are discordant. Only Su Shi's division—taking \"one may possess the state\" and above as governing people, and \"deep roots and firm foundations\" as serving Heaven—is more satisfying in meaning. Laozi's book, in its highest sense, can elucidate the Dao; in its middle sense, can cultivate the self; and extended, can govern others. Its words are always applicable to these three. This chapter begins with \"in governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality\" as its core, and the subsequent text elaborates on thrift in repeated detail. From \"early compliance is called the repeated accumulation of virtue\" to \"none can fathom one's limits,\" all expound the meaning of thrift, encompassing both governing people and serving Heaven. It then cites possessing the state to illustrate the application of governing people, and touches on deep roots and firm foundations to address the essentials of serving Heaven. For the Dao's thrift, when taken to the point of early compliance without interruption, and virtue's accumulation, when taken to the point where none can fathom its limits, then contraction and expansion are both fitting, and essence and function are both wondrous. With this, possessing the state enables long endurance, and firming the self enables long life. Only because governing people and serving Heaven are both possible does it say \"nothing surpasses frugality.\" However, Su Shi's explanation of early compliance as \"complying with others\" and Wu's interpretation of possessing the state as an analogy for preserving this body are both partial in meaning and not worth adopting.\n\nChapter Fifty-One:\n\"Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.\"\n\nThose who oversee the world with the Dao—\ntheir ghosts do not act as spirits.\nNot that their ghosts do not act as spirits,\nbut their spirits do no harm to people.\nNot that their spirits do no harm to people—\nthe sage also does no harm to the people.\nWhen the two do not harm one another,\nthen virtue and power converge and return.\n\n[As the *Hanfeizi’s* \"Explaining the Laozi\" states:\n\"Whenever laws and decrees are altered, benefits and harms shift; when benefits and harms shift, the people change their occupations. Thus, managing great multitudes and frequently disturbing them yields little success. Storing great vessels and frequently moving them results in much damage. Cooking a small fish and frequently stirring it spoils its sheen. Governing a great state and frequently changing laws makes the people suffer. Therefore, a ruler who embodies the Dao values tranquility and weighs the gravity of altering laws.\n\nWhen people are afflicted by illness, they esteem physicians; when misfortune strikes, they fear ghosts. But when a sage rules from above, the people have few desires. With few desires, their blood and qi are regulated, and their actions are orderly. Orderly actions lead to fewer calamities. Those free from internal ailments and external punishments or legal executions hold ghosts in great disdain. Thus it is said: 'Those who oversee the world with the Dao—their ghosts do not act as spirits.' This means that in a well-governed age, ghosts and spirits do not harm people.\n\nCalling a sick person 'harmed by ghosts' is one thing; when the ruler executes the people, that is the ruler harming them. When the people do not violate the law and the ruler does not impose punishments, that is the ruler not harming the people. Hence it is said: 'The sage also does no harm to the people.'\n\nWhen the ruler does not harm the people and ghosts do not harm people, this is the two not harming one another. Then virtue resides entirely in the people. Thus it is said: 'Virtue and power converge and return.' This means that virtue—whether hidden or manifest, above or below—flourishes and returns wholly to the people.\"]\n\nWang Bi comments:\n\"Agitation brings much harm; stillness preserves authenticity. Thus, the greater the state, the more tranquil its ruler must be—only then can he broadly win the hearts of the people. It is like cooking a small fish: do not disturb it. When things abide by their nature, spirits have no influence. With no influence from spirits, one does not perceive their numinous power. When the Dao governs, the sage does no harm to people. When the sage does no harm, one does not perceive his sagacity. Relying on coercive nets to govern things marks the decline of governance. To make people unaware of the numinous and sagely as such is the ultimate realization of the Dao. When the numinous and the sagely do not harm one another, they unite with the Dao and return together to the people.\"]\n\nChapter Fifty-Two.\n\nChapter Fifty-Two.\n\nThe great state is the lower reaches of the world’s rivers, the confluence of all under heaven. As the female of all under heaven, she constantly overcomes the male through stillness. Stillness is the female’s way of humbling herself. Thus, when a great state humbles itself before a small state, it wins the small state. When a small state humbles itself before a great state, it wins the great state. Some humble themselves to win; some humble themselves and thereby win. The great state desires no more than to nurture and shelter others; the small state desires no more than to serve and join others. When both attain what they desire, the greater must humble itself.\n\nThe great state, though not inherently beneath others, can place itself below them—just as the rivers and seas, by virtue of their lowliness, become the confluence of all waters. The small state, though naturally in a lower position, can likewise place itself below others—just as the female, without initiating movement to seek the male, achieves through the stillness of her lowly stance the male’s active pursuit from above. Thus, the following passage immediately takes up these two analogies and addresses them separately: when the great state does not rely on its loftiness, the small state delights in allegiance; when the small state can rest content in its humility, it wins the favor of the great state. This is how the great state, through humble deference, secures the small state’s attachment, and how the small state, through submission, gains the great state’s acceptance.\n\nYet the small, being naturally beneath others, need not fear inability to humble itself; thus the closing line focuses solely on the greater: *the greater must humble itself.* Yuan’s note observes that the chapter’s opening speaks only of the great state as the world’s confluence, not of the small state as the world’s female—this is because the female’s smallness requires no mention, while the great, not yet knowing to emulate water’s lowliness, is addressed throughout.\n\nEach person has desires yet does not know the Way by which to fulfill them. The great state’s desire is no more than to nurture and shelter others; the small state’s desire is no more than to be accepted by others. This is the common sentiment of all under heaven, yet now both attain their desires through humility—so profound is the efficacy of *below.* Thus, among all things under heaven, even the greatest must humble itself.\n\nLin Xiyi remarks: The full weight of this chapter rests upon its closing line. For whether nurturing and sheltering others or serving and joining them, neither can be achieved without self-lowering. Only through self-lowering can both attain what they desire. Therefore, those who know the Way invariably regard humility as proper. The meaning is this: the strong must be able to be weak; the possessing must be able to be without—only then do they know the Way. This principle recurs throughout the text, yet commentators often mistake the analogies for literal meaning. Only Huang Maocai rightly observes that this chapter is entirely a borrowed analogy to clarify the Way—though he does not extend this insight to other chapters.\n\nChapter Fifty-Three\n\nThe Dao is the profound mystery of the myriad things,\nthe treasure of the good,\nthe refuge of the not-good.\n{Fu Yi adds *ye* after *Ao*; adds *suo* before *bao*. Gu Shenzi’s edition adds *bu* before *bao*.}\n\nFair words can be traded in the marketplace;\nnoble conduct can be exalted above others.\n{The *Huainanzi* reads: “Fair words can be traded for honor; noble conduct can be exalted above others.” Fu Yi reads: “Honored words can be exalted above others.”}\n\nIf one enters into what is not good,\nhow can it be discarded?\n\nThus, when the Son of Heaven is established\nand the Three Dukes are appointed,\nthough one may offer a large jade disk followed by a team of four horses,\nit is not equal to sitting and presenting this Dao.\n{Fu Yi reads: “presenting this Dao.”}\n\nWhy was this Dao so prized in ancient times?\n{One edition omits *he*. Fu Yi reads: “Why was it so?”}\n\nIs it not because one seeks and obtains it,\nand with it, sins are remitted?\nTherefore, it is prized by all under heaven.\n{Chen Xianggu reads *bu yue* as *bu ri*. Wang Bi reads: “to seek and obtain.” One edition reads: “with it, sins can be remitted.”}\n\n{This chapter speaks of the supreme value of the Dao, desiring that people know its worth and seek it. If noble conduct can be exalted above others, such that one attains the position of Son of Heaven or the Three Dukes, what could be more honored? If fair words can be traded in the marketplace, such that a hundred strings of cowries are bestowed, yet not equal to a single word of this Dao, what could be more precious? Why, then, did the ancients so honor and treasure this Dao? Is it not because it is the treasure of the good, and when sought, is obtained; the refuge of the not-good, and with it, sins are remitted? That it is the most prized under heaven is indeed fitting.}\n\nWu Cheng states: The innermost corner of the southwest chamber is where the most honored reside—thus it serves as a metaphor for the supreme value of the Dao. Those who possess the Dao are appointed to the positions of ruler and teacher, becoming the Son of Heaven or the Three Dukes, all because the Dao is esteemed. In court visits and diplomatic audiences, four-horse carriages are arrayed in the courtyard, and the envoy first presents a large jade disc to convey the mandate—such rites are weighty indeed. Yet even these do not compare to the value of kneeling to offer this Dao.\n\nLi Jiamo remarks: The worthy treasure the Dao, thus they rejoice in attaining what they seek. The unworthy have no refuge but the Dao, thus they rejoice in having their sins remitted. Since this arises from the natural root of the human heart, with no external compulsion, when words and deeds accord with the Dao, their beauty may be traded in the marketplace, and their honor may be bestowed upon others. If this were not the natural inclination of the human heart, words would go unheeded, and deeds would meet no response—how could they achieve such effect? Because each person is rooted in the Dao, even if one unfortunately falls into unworthiness, how could the sage bear to abandon them? Thus, the Son of Heaven is established, and the Three Dukes are appointed—not to bestow mere wealth and nobility, but to prevent people from being irrevocably lost in unworthiness, guiding them back to goodness through this Dao.\n\nLü Huiqing says: In the generation of the myriad things, not a single being lacks this Dao. Only the good know from whence their blessings arise, thus they attain it and gain boundless abundance. The unworthy, recognizing their own unworthiness, may yet have their myriad transgressions dissolved in an instant. If fair words can be traded and noble conduct bestowed, then people—whether good or not—naturally know what is beautiful and what is honorable. How much more is the Dao to humanity like heaven and earth, which cover and bear all without exception? It is not merely a matter of being traded or bestowed. How, then, could one abandon those who are unworthy?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 54**\nAct without acting,\nAttend to affairs without affairs,\nSavor the tasteless.\nGreat and small, many and few—\nRepay resentment with virtue.\nPlan for difficulty while it is easy,\nAchieve greatness while it is small.\nThe difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy,\nThe great affairs of the world must arise from the small.\nThus the sage never strives for greatness,\nAnd so accomplishes greatness.\nOne who makes light promises is seldom trusted,\nOne who treats many things as easy encounters many difficulties.\nThus the sage treats things as difficult,\nAnd so never encounters difficulty.\n\nWhat is secure is easily maintained,\nWhat shows no sign is easily planned for,\nWhat is fragile is easily dissolved,\nWhat is minute is easily scattered.\nAct before things arise,\nGovern before disorder begins.\n\nA tree as large as a man’s embrace grows from a tiny sprout,\nA nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth,\nA journey of a thousand *li* begins with a single step.\nOne who acts will fail,\nOne who grasps will lose.\n\nThus the sage practices non-action and so never fails,\nPractices non-grasping and so never loses.\nWhen the people engage in affairs,\nThey often fail when nearly accomplished.\nBe as cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nAnd there will be no failed undertakings.\n\nTherefore the sage desires what others do not desire,\nDoes not prize rare and hard-to-obtain goods,\nLearns what others do not learn,\nAnd restores what the multitude has passed over.\nThus he relies on the spontaneous self-so of the myriad things\nAnd does not dare to act.\n\n*(This chapter elucidates the principle of non-action that accomplishes all things. Following the discussion of \"no affairs\" and \"no flavor,\" it proceeds to address great and small, many and few, and repaying enmity with virtue—demonstrating that the sage’s non-action is not mere empty negation or idle talk, but truly capable of viewing great and small as equal, transforming enmity into virtue, and accepting all difficult emotions with equanimity. Only then can one verify the practice of \"affairs without affairs\" and \"flavor without flavor.\" After explaining action before things arise and governance before disorder begins, it further elaborates on non-action and non-grasping, clarifying that the sage’s \"action\" is not about meticulous caution or clever vigilance. His non-action and non-grasping arise from what others do not perceive, without contrivance or intention. When flavor is without flavor, his desires become \"desires without desire.\" When affairs are without affairs, his learning becomes \"learning without learning.\" To \"rely\" is to await—awaiting the spontaneous self-so of things without daring to impose action. This is what is meant by \"non-action naturally transforming\" and \"tranquility naturally rectifying.\")*\n\nWu Cheng said: \"The fundamental tenet of Laozi is to act through non-action. 'No affairs' and 'no flavor' both expound this principle. The reason one can achieve non-action is by addressing difficulties when they are easy and undertaking greatness when it is small. Worldly affairs begin as easy but end as difficult, begin as small but end as great. Thus, if one plans and acts at the outset, effort is spared, and non-action is naturally attained. If one does not act early but hastily intervenes, the easy gradually becomes difficult, the small gradually becomes great, and both mind and strength are exhausted—how can non-action then be possible? The sage never strives for greatness and thus accomplishes greatness, continuing the discussion of the great and small of affairs to address the great and small of the mind. When things are small, the mind does not dare to regard itself as great; even when things become great, the mind remains unchanged. By being small from beginning to end, it can accomplish greatness. The four phrases—'light promises seldom trusted, many things treated as easy encounter many difficulties'—continue the discussion of the difficulty and ease of affairs to address the difficulty and ease of the mind. What begins as easy will inevitably end as difficult. Thus, though the sage faces ease at the outset, his mind remains cautious. By never treating things as easy from beginning to end, he ultimately encounters no difficulty. The six phrases beginning with 'what is secure is easily maintained' speak of planning when things are easy. The three phrases—'a tree as large as a man’s embrace grows from a tiny sprout, a nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth, a journey of a thousand *li* begins with a single step'—speak of acting when things are small. The four phrases about the people engaging in affairs further develop the ideas of 'ultimately encountering no difficulty' and 'never striving for greatness.' Though one may begin by treating things as difficult and not daring to regard them as great, if by the end one becomes complacent and self-important, affairs may nearly succeed yet fail in the end. Therefore, one must be as cautious at the end as at the beginning to ensure no ultimate failure. The chapter begins with 'practicing non-action' and concludes with 'relying on the spontaneous self-so without daring to act,' thus bringing the chapter’s meaning full circle.\"\n\nWang Dao said: \"All people have something they act upon; the sage is also human—how could he alone have nothing to act upon? The difference is that what the multitude acts upon are affairs of action, while what the sage acts upon is the Dao of non-action. 'Affairs' are the conditions of action; 'flavor' is the principle and essence of action.\"\n\nLiu Gai said: \"Desiring what others do not desire is called 'desiring without desire.' Not desiring what others desire is called 'not prizing rare and hard-to-obtain goods.' Learning what others do not learn is called 'learning without learning.' Not learning what others learn is called 'restoring what the multitude has passed over.'\"\n\nWang Pang said: \"Relying on the spontaneous self-so of the myriad things without daring to act allows each to rest in the constancy of its nature, so that affairs and things show no signs. How then could anything be fragile enough to dissolve or minute enough to scatter?\"\n\nSu Zhe said: \"The world fears the great and disdains the small, fears the difficult and treats the easy lightly. If one waits until things are difficult before planning or great before acting, affairs will seldom succeed. The sage equalizes great and small, unifies many and few, fears nothing, and treats nothing lightly—how could he not succeed? When things have not yet arisen, holding and planning them is sufficient. When they are about to manifest, they cannot be dissolved or scattered. Thus, acting before things arise is best; governing before disorder begins is next. The sage awaits them with non-action and holds them with non-grasping, enabling blessings to arise naturally and calamities to vanish on their own. For example, when planting seedlings, deep plowing and thorough weeding ensure a bountiful autumn harvest. When confronted by thieves, sitting upright and observing intently will make them retreat on their own. The world does not understand the spontaneity of things, believing that nothing is accomplished without action and nothing retained without grasping. Thus, they constantly contend with calamity and burden themselves with blessings. Even when affairs are still minute, there may be those who do not yet understand and allow them to unfold naturally. But when they see things nearly accomplished and their minds dwell on gain and loss, there is none who does not then act to ruin them.\"\n\nThe sage knows the harm of forced action and does not rely on human effort to assist Heaven. From beginning to end, all follows its natural course, and thus there is nothing that does not succeed. Lü Huìqīng said: \"Forced action entails affairs; affairs entail complications. To act without acting is to make affairs no-affairs. Though one may ponder this repeatedly, what complication could remain?\" What people find hardest to forget is resentment, yet if I repay it solely with virtue, what else could trouble my heart?\n\nThe affairs of the world begin in the minute and arise from the easy. If there is anything to be done, I must first perceive it in the easy and the minute. Once perceived, I act upon the image—this is what is called \"knowing the subtle and attaining the spirit.\" Thus, one never acts upon the great, and so can accomplish the great. For while others guard against the great in the minute, how could they ever act upon the great in the great? Even the sage finds this difficult, and so ultimately encounters no difficulty—by making the difficult easy before it becomes difficult.\n\nHold fast to tranquility; plan before signs appear—this is acting upon what has not yet arisen. Break what is fragile; scatter what is minute—this is governing before disorder arises. If one acts only after something has arisen, the desire for success will instead bring failure. If one governs only after disorder has set in, grasping will only grow firmer and lead to greater loss. The sage acts by non-action, and so there is no action; governs by non-governing, and so there is no grasping. The people’s undertakings always begin after something has already arisen, and so they reach near-completion only to ruin them—because they do not know the root.\n\nIf one knows that the great arises from the small, the high from the low, the distant from the near, and acts with caution, what failure or loss could there be? Master Li Jiāmó said: \"Proceeding from the easy, even the difficult becomes easy. Advancing from the minute, even the great becomes minute. Thus, the sage never acts upon the great, yet the great inevitably returns to him—because he is without intention. The sage, before affairs arise, always treats them as if they were difficult, not presuming that things must conform to me. Thus, he constantly abides in what is secure, and nothing is insecure. Then his holding is no-holding, and so is easily held. Even if the slightest sign of insecurity stirs, he plans against it before it takes shape and breaks or scatters it while it is still fragile and minute. Thus, nothing disturbs his security—by holding to security before it is lost and governing insecurity before it arises.\n\nIt is like a tree growing on its own, earth gradually rising, or a journey extending day by day. Within non-action, action arises naturally; within non-accumulation, accumulation occurs naturally. Thus, day by day, burdens fall away, and goodness accumulates day by day—yet the sage remains unaware. The reason the world’s pursuit of the Dao is so difficult to complete and easy to ruin lies in its intentionality—its grasping and forcing. At first, it seems as though no effort is spared, yet in the end, one cannot escape negligence. All this is the fault of forcing and grasping. If one neither forces nor grasps from beginning to end, one could not even find negligence, let alone indulge in it.\n\nJiao Hong said: \"Non-action, no-affairs, no-complications—this is the Dao. This Dao cannot be attained by force; it is supremely easy. It cannot be glimpsed by the eye; it is supremely minute. Though supremely easy, the supremely difficult depends on it for resolution. Though supremely minute, the supremely great depends on it for completion. How could one neglect it for its ease and minuteness? Some who study the Dao may glimpse this truth, yet their minds are seized by the desire for greatness, and so the easy and the minute do not long remain theirs. Only the sage, from beginning to end, acts by non-action, engages in no-affairs, and savors no-complications—without allowing the world’s notion of greatness to divide his mind. Thus, when encountering the difficult and the great, he meets them with stillness, leaving no trace of obstruction, and the Dao is thereby preserved whole. This is what is called 'accomplishing the great.'\n\nAlas! This is not something those of weak resolve, who see principles dimly and waver in their purpose, could ever perceive, uphold, or discuss with those who make light promises and treat matters carelessly.\"} Chapter Fifty-Five}\n\nThe *Heshang Gong* edition separates the passage beginning with \"dividing their peace and ease in maintaining\" into a distinct chapter, while Wu Cheng’s edition correctly combines them. Yet, he arbitrarily rearranges the text, doubling its content without annotating his reasons for relocation—implying the original was thus—an approach most improper. As for Yao Nai, he further excises the nineteen characters \"those who follow affairs\" from the people, placing them at the chapter’s end as a separate section, all without discernible intent.\n\nThe ancients skilled in the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people but instead to make them simple. The people are difficult to govern because their knowledge is excessive. Thus, governing the state with knowledge is the state’s bane; governing the state without knowledge is the state’s blessing. To know these two principles is also a model. Constantly knowing this model is to attain profound virtue. Profound virtue runs deep and far, turning back with all things, and thus reaches great compliance.\n\nTo deem \"without knowledge\" is to preserve authenticity and comply with nature. \"Excessive knowledge\" means abundant exposure to cunning deceit, which obscures one’s simplicity. When the people are moved by clever schemes, perverse intentions arise; then, further craft is employed to guard against their deceit. The people, recognizing these preventive measures, evade them in turn, devising ever more intricate and covert stratagems. Thus, treachery and falsehood proliferate daily. Hence it is said: governing the state with knowledge is the state’s bane.\n\nMaster Lü Huiqing said: Those in antiquity skilled in the Dao appeared dim among the bright common folk; I alone seemed dull. The common folk were sharp and discerning; I alone was vague and unconcerned. In this way did they conduct themselves, and thus did they extend the same to the people.\n\nMaster Li Jiamo said: The people, foolish yet considering themselves wise, are ensnared by desires and unable to return. I now show them effortless action and anchor them in plain simplicity, yet they remain unmoved—how much less would they awaken if I displayed knowledge to them? This would be to harm them. If one acts without contrivance and does not awaken the people’s scheming minds, then scheming minds will not arise, and purity will be complete. This is called the state’s blessing—is this not true?\n\nMaster Sima of Sushui said.\n\nThose of worldly disposition all esteem knowledge, yet those possessed of virtue alone hold it in low regard. Though this runs counter to common sentiment, it accords with the Dao. Thus, what knowledge accords with is small, while what virtue accords with is great.\n\nYuan’s note on this passage: Only understanding these two points may serve as a model. All other explanations fall short of clarity. For those in antiquity skilled in the Way of the scholar, though their subtlety and profound penetration were deep beyond comprehension, when it came to the harm of knowledge and the blessing of non-knowledge, this was manifest and plain, easy to grasp. If one can but deeply believe and firmly hold to this, not allowing knowledge to obscure one’s true nature, then even if the fullness of their essence and function remains difficult to fathom, one may still attain the aim of governance without error. Thus it is said: understanding these two points may serve as a model.\n\nYet if one can truly and constantly take them as a model, then cunning knowledge will daily recede, and pure simplicity will daily be complete. Their governance will be unconcerned, their people artless. Not only will this avoid harm—one may even call it profound virtue. For when virtue is called profound, it is deep and far-reaching, contrary to the common. Those who hear of it may laugh heartily, or at best entertain it half-heartedly. Yet here alone, without doubting its contrariness, one deeply believes it may be taken as a model. Though this runs counter to worldly custom, it accords with the great Dao. If it accords with the Dao, what is it if not profound virtue? Yet how few are those who understand this!\n\nChapter Fifty-Six\n\nThe reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys is that they excel at being lowly. Thus they become kings of the hundred valleys. Therefore, if one wishes to be above the people, one must speak to them from below. If one wishes to lead the people, one must place oneself behind them. Thus the sage, though above, does not burden the people; though ahead, does not harm them. Therefore the world delights in exalting him and never wearies of it. Because he does not contend, no one in the world can contend with him.\n\nThe world all says: \"My Dao is great yet seems unworthy.\" {Fu Yi’s version reads \"I\" instead of \"my,\" and omits \"Dao.\"} Precisely because it is great, it seems unworthy. If it were worthy, it would long since have been petty. {One version omits \"also\" and \"indeed.\" ○ This chapter’s wording follows Wang Bi’s edition. Other versions place \"the sage\" before \"if one wishes to be above the people,\" which introduces linguistic flaws in discussing the sage. Some read \"by speaking to them from below\" and \"by placing oneself behind them,\" following the syntax of the earlier phrase \"by excelling at being lowly.\" Others change all four instances of \"people\" to \"men,\" reducing it to a comparison between things rather than the fixed relationship between ruler and people. Still others read \"though ahead, men cannot harm him,\" which redundantly echoes the later phrase \"no one can contend with him.\" These two lines appear in Fu Yi’s version as \"abides above, abides ahead,\" while the *Heshang Gong* version reads \"abides above the people, abides ahead of the people\"—both inferior to Wang Bi’s harmonious phrasing.}\n\n{Only by being lowly does one become great—this is the core tenet of the Old Master. To be called \"king\" means all under heaven turn toward and submit. To be called \"sea\" means all streams gather and converge. People know the king is most exalted, yet do not grasp why he is exalted. It is because he is supremely great. And why can he achieve such greatness? Because he can be lowly and contain all things. \"If you do not boast, no one in the world will contend with you in ability. If you do not claim merit, no one in the world will contend with you in achievement.\" Let the world forget who is above and who is ahead, and instead vie to exalt him, to place him above and ahead. Such a Dao may truly be called great. Yet the world instead says it does not resemble ordinary sentiment. But greatness does not resemble; resemblance is not greatness. If rivers and seas vied with the hundred streams, how could they remain rivers and seas? If the king’s Dao resembled any single thing, how could he be king of all under heaven? The previous chapter spoke of being contrary to things as the way to accord with them. This chapter speaks of not resembling the common as the way to be great. The meaning is one and the same. The *Inscription on the Golden Man* says: \"The noble person knows one cannot be above all under heaven, so he lowers himself. Knowing one cannot be ahead of others, he places himself behind.\" Yang Xiong said: \"Those who humble themselves are exalted by others. Those who place themselves behind are put ahead by others.\" Dong Sijing said: \"Lower your virtue, and your position will rise. Place yourself behind, and you will be first.\" Su Ziyou said: \"Those with the Dao never seek to be above or ahead of others. But once they lower and place themselves behind, their Dao cannot but rise and lead.\" All have grasped the Old Master’s intent. ○ Lü Huiqing said: \"Those who possess all under heaven, in terms of position, are certainly above others. Yet they style themselves 'orphaned, widowed, and lacking,' and accept the world’s disgrace and misfortune—how lowly their words! In terms of precedence, they are certainly ahead of others. Yet they act only under compulsion, respond only when moved, and rise only when unavoidable—how they place themselves behind! Thus, though above, people find bearing them light. Though ahead, people find following them beneficial. Above and below forget one another, and so the world delights in exalting them without tiring. For what they take is not what the people contend for. Through non-action, the world does not even perceive their presence, so how can they be called unworthy? And who could contend with them?\"} Chapter Fifty-Seven\n\nI possess three treasures, which I hold and cherish:\nThe first is called compassion,\nThe second is called frugality,\nThe third is called

is most urgent today.\nIf Heaven would save these people,\nIt must cause one who acts with compassion to emerge and guard them.\nIs this not what Laozi deeply expects of the world?\n\nJiao Hong said:\nNot martial, not enraged,\nYet it is said to match Heaven, the ancient utmost—why?\nBecause the extreme of contention is warfare,\nSo he borrows this to illustrate the virtue of non-contention.\nThere is a saying in the use of arms—\nThis is an ancient saying of military strategists.\n*Reng* is the same as *reng*.\nThe *Book of Songs* says, \"still grasping the captive foe.\"\n\nWang Bi said:\nThe officer is the leader of the soldiers.\n\"Not martial, not enraged\" means acting later, not first,\nResponding, not initiating.\n\"Not contending\" means not contending with others.\nIf one employs others without placing oneself below,\nThey will not give their full strength.\nTo say that with sorrow, compassion, and humility,\nOne employs them in war—\nEven without ranks,\nWithout raising arms,\nWithout weapons,\nThe enemy will have no one to resist.\nYet though I am sorrowful, compassionate, and humble,\nI do not seek to become invincible under Heaven.\nOnly when forced to the point of invincibility\nDoes this become my greatest misfortune—\nNearly losing my treasures.\n(He refers to the Three Treasures.)\nWhen opposing forces meet,\nThe grieving one will surely pity and not seek profit or avoid harm,\nThus they must prevail.\n\nYuan’s note:\nArmies rely on fighting to the death to resist the enemy,\nHence there are ranks, raised arms, and weapons.\nBut if there is no enemy to repel,\nThen there are no ranks to arrange, no arms to raise, no weapons to grasp.\nFor to make the latter one’s priority,\nTo make retreat one’s advance,\nAlways to make others come to you rather than going to them—\nThis is to hold the art of complete victory,\nTo achieve it without labor, sitting and attaining it.\nThis is called repelling without an enemy.\nYet though this is called having no enemy,\nIs this truly what I delight in?\nFor when arms reach the point of invincibility under Heaven,\nThe slaughter must be great—\nNo misfortune is greater.\nThe former troops turned their weapons back,\nBlood flowed, floating the pestles—\nEven the armies of kings,\nThe gentleman cannot bear to speak of it.\nIs this not what is meant by nearly losing my treasures?\nThus when I use arms,\nI do so only when forced,\nRegard them as inauspicious,\nAnd conduct myself as in mourning—\nThis is the utmost of sorrow.\nOnly with sorrow can one speak of victory.\nThis is what is meant by \"with compassion, one prevails in attack and stands firm in defense;\nHeaven will save them, guarding them with compassion.\"\n\nAll editions read: \"No misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy;\nUnderestimating the enemy nearly loses my treasures.\"\nBut to underestimate the enemy is to court defeat;\nIf one’s own life is not preserved,\nHow can one speak of nearly losing treasures?\nThis is merely Sun Wu’s art of victory,\nNot the teaching of the supreme compassion and sorrow.\n\nSu Zhe said:\nBoldness, expansion, and taking the lead—\nThese three are what people universally detest.\nThose who are detested by the multitude\nOften draw near to death.\nBut to guard things with compassion\nIs to make them love you like parents;\nThough they die for you, they will not refuse.\nThus one can attack and defend.\nIf Heaven would save these people,\nIt opens their hearts and minds,\nSo that there is nothing they do not cherish.\nWhen nothing is not cherished,\nAll things become their guard.\nThus when two enemies meet,\nAnd I act only when forced,\nThen I have a sorrowful heart.\nWhen the sorrowful heart appears,\nHeaven and man assist it—\nEven if one wished not to prevail, it would be impossible.\n\nLü Huiqing said:\nThe so-called Three Treasures\nAre all difficult for people to uphold.\nOnly one who is without self and does not contend can uphold them.\nYet only through compassion can one be frugal;\nOnly through frugality does one dare not take the lead under Heaven.\nThus compassion is the source of the Three Treasures.\nThe movement of the Dao is always under compulsion,\nYet its application always lies in non-contention.\nWhen applied to the use of arms,\nIt seems as if it cannot be put into practice.\nYet one who acts as host is contrary, while the guest is compliant;\nThe host is wearied, while the guest is at ease;\nAdvancing is arrogant, while retreating is humble;\nAdvancing is restless, while retreating is calm.\nTo await the contrary with compliance,\nThe wearied with ease,\nThe arrogant with humility,\nThe restless with calm—\nNone can match this.\nThus the constancy of the Dao\nLies in non-action—\nEven in warfare, it is the same.\n\nMy words are most easy to know, most easy to practice.\nYet under Heaven none can know them, none can practice them.\n\nWords have their source, affairs have their lord.\nOnly through lack of knowing is it that they do not know me.\n\nThose who know me are few;\nThus what I treasure is precious.\nTherefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade.\n\nTo know yet seem not to know is supreme;\nTo not know yet claim to know is a flaw.\nOnly by regarding this flaw as a flaw\nIs one therefore without flaw.\n\nThe sage’s flaw is that he regards the flaw as a flaw—\nBecause he regards the flaw as a flaw,\nHe is therefore without flaw.\n\nThe teaching of Laozi is simply to be yielding, weak, humble, and lowly—nothing more. His words are most simple and easy, yet as the world declines and customs degrade, none under Heaven recognize their value or practice them. Why is this? Because the matters of yielding, weakness, and humility that I speak of inherently contain a unifying principle and governing essence. The world does not know this essence of mine; they see only the outward words, which appear as nothing more than yielding, humility, and lowliness. Thus they regard them as base and unworthy of esteem, failing to treasure them. Hence my deep lament.\n\nFor the great Dao is at odds with the vulgar and unworthy, and its profound virtue runs counter to worldly things. Those who truly know it are naturally few—this is why the Dao is precious in the eyes of the world and cannot be ignored. If the Dao were no different from common sentiments and ordinary views, it would be unworthy of reverence. Since people do not know it, I possess three treasures, which only I can uphold and practice—like one who wears coarse cloth while holding jade, unknown to others.\n\nWhat is treasured within is the understanding of the source of words and the lord of affairs. What is outwardly worn as lowly is the knowing that does not appear as knowing—like one who seems foolish and obscure. This is the highest virtue, which appears as disgrace. Since people do not know, they inevitably turn and claim to know, displaying their jade to seek buyers. But what they offer cannot be the true treasure. They mistake flaw for beauty, take the compass for a mere ornament. Even if a sage dwells among them, they cannot be cured or saved. What is this if not a flaw?\n\nIf one day they recognize their flaw and regard it as a flaw, then the means to dispel it lies precisely here. The first half speaks of the difficulty of those who know the Dao, while the latter half laments the multitude who falsely claim to know. Those who are ignorant of the true Dao are deluded by vulgar views. In terms of the human condition, not knowing is the symptom of the flaw, while mistaking one’s false views for knowledge is its root cause. Thus the latter part uses the metaphor of illness.\n\nThe *Heshang Gong* edition divides this into two chapters, and later commentators have followed suit. Upon examination, the passage beginning with \"knowing yet not-knowing\" fully develops the meaning of the first half. Had the latter half not clearly pointed this out, the notion of \"knowing rarity values me\" would risk becoming flawed.\n\nThe people do not fear authority—\nthen great authority arrives.\n\nDo not constrict their dwelling.\nDo not stifle what gives them life.\nOnly by not stifling\nis there no stifling.\n\nThus the sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nloves himself but does not exalt himself.\nTherefore, he discards that and adopts this.\n\n---\n\nJiao Hong notes: *Wei* (威, authority) and *wei* (畏, fear) were interchangeable in ancient usage. When people do not fear what they ought to fear, what is truly fearsome will come. The following lines all speak of fearing what ought to be feared.\n\nLü Huiqing says: When the people are not wholly aligned with the Dao but instead esteem knowledge, their lives become excessive. Excessive living leads to disregard for death, and disregard for death leads to defiance of authority. When the people reach the point of defying authority, there is nothing they will not do—this is how Heaven manifests its authority and metes out its great punishment.\n\nLi Jiamo says: The one who knows the Dao meets things as they come and rests content. Thus, he does not grow weary of his dwelling nor stifle what gives him life. Only by not stifling himself does nothing else stifle him. This arises from knowing himself without parading his knowledge, loving himself without exalting his love. If he harbored the intent to display or exalt himself, he would inevitably constrict his dwelling and stifle his life, unable to find peace even for a day.\n\nChen Yidian says: The world contains a path that leads to death by fleeing life—this is the great authority. Not fearing it means entering into fear. Thus, one must not dare to constrict the dwelling of the self with excessive desires, nor grow weary of what sustains life by neglecting one’s duties. Only by dwelling in contentment and not stifling life does one secure the self and not grow weary of the Dao. \"Knowing oneself but not displaying oneself\" means examining and fulfilling one’s duties without boasting of one’s possessions. Knowing oneself means knowing what to love; not displaying oneself means having nothing to pride oneself on. Thus, he discards the constricted and stifled in favor of what brings peace.\n\nThe *Laozi* largely warns against boasting and external craving.\n\nYuan’s note: When people do not know the fearfulness of authority, it is due to their covetous desires. External covetousness arises from internal weariness. \"Dwelling\" refers to circumstances like poverty, wealth, honor, lowliness, success, or failure. \"What gives life\" refers to the body’s experiences, such as toil, ease, glory, disgrace, suffering, or joy. People regard their life and dwelling as inferior to others’ and feel shame. Thus, dwelling in poverty rather than wealth is constricting; dwelling in lowliness rather than honor is constricting; dwelling in obscurity rather than fame and renown is constricting. Constriction breeds weariness, and weariness breeds envy. Weariness of toil leads to longing for ease; weariness of disgrace leads to craving for glory; weariness of suffering leads to yearning for joy. When the flame of envy burns brightly, the great authority they ought to fear follows closely behind. For those who fret over gain and loss, there is no limit to their excesses—those who seek glory bring about disgrace, and those who seek life invite death. Self-weariness leads to weariness from Heaven and others. But if one does not constrict, one does not grow weary. If I do not weary of myself, who can weary of me?\n\nThough the people and the sage differ vastly in stature, their principles are not distinct. Constricting one’s dwelling inevitably leads to self-aggrandizement. The sage rests content wherever he is, taking self-knowledge as sufficient and never hastening to display himself to boast of his greatness. Those who stifle what gives them life inevitably seek to exalt their lives. The sage treasures authenticity and embraces simplicity, valuing freedom from danger and disgrace as self-love, never seeking external exaltation to enrich his life. Thus, having nothing to envy means having nothing to weary of, and having nothing to weary of means having nothing to fear. What is absent is what is discarded; what is present is what is adopted.\n\nMany commentators on this passage lean toward Chan Buddhism. Wu Cheng’s emendation of \"not stifling\" to \"not growing weary\" is clear and incisive, yet it does not cohere with the lines \"the sage knows himself but does not display himself.\" Both miss the original intent.\n\nChapter Sixty\nCourage in daring leads to death;\ncourage in not daring leads to life.\nOf these two, one brings benefit, the other harm—\nwhat the heavens abhor.\nWho knows the reason?\nThus even the sage finds this difficult.\n\nThe Way of Heaven does not contend yet excels at victory,\ndoes not speak yet excels at response,\nis not summoned yet comes of itself,\nis unhurried yet excels at planning.\n*(The character 繟 appears as 墠 in the Heshang Gong text, as 坦 in the Liang Emperor Wu’s version; 繟, 墠, and 坦 are interchangeable. Fu Yi writes 默, which would duplicate the sense of “does not speak.”)*\n\nThe heavenly net is vast and wide,\nloose yet never failing.\n*(Heshang Gong’s version reads “never loses.”)*\n\nThe people do not fear death.\n*(Fu Yi adds the word “constantly” after “people.”)*\nWhy then threaten them with death?\nIf the people constantly feared death and acted perversely,\nI could seize and execute them.\n*(Fu Yi omits “seize.” One variant reads 岂, “how could,” in place of 得, “could.”)*\nWho would dare?\n\nThere is always one who executes;\nto take the executioner’s place in killing\nis like taking the master carpenter’s place in hewing—\nthose who take the master carpenter’s place in hewing\nrarely avoid injuring their hands.\n*(The six lines beginning “There is always one who executes” vary across the Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, Kaiyuan, and Chen Xianggu editions. This version adopts the first four lines from Fu Yi and the final two from the Huainanzi.)*\n\n*(Wang Bi comments:)*\n\nBoth act with courage,\nyet their applications differ,\nso their benefits and harms diverge.\nThus it is said: some gain, some suffer.\n\nWho can fathom the intent behind what Heaven detests?\nOnly the sage, perhaps.\nYet even the sage’s clarity\nfinds courage and daring difficult to judge—\nhow much more so for those without such wisdom?\n\nLi Zhi says:\nVictory comes through non-contention,\nresponse through non-speech,\nmanifestation through non-summoning,\nplanning through non-calculation.\nThis is how Heaven’s vastness remains unobstructed without fail.\nIf victory required contention,\neven its vastness would falter.\n\nZhang Lei says:\nMost people live chasing desires and pursuing profit,\nand die in such pursuit—\nthus they never truly know what death is to be feared.\nYet those who govern others\nseek to make them afraid,\nand do so only by threatening death.\nHow deluded!\nIf they truly feared death,\nthen seizing and executing the perverse\nwould surely end their perversity.\nYet the world never lacks punishments,\nand perversity never ceases—\nclearly, death alone cannot make people afraid.\nAll things live and die of themselves,\ngoverned by unseen forces.\nTo disregard their natural order\nand wield the power of punishment and life and death,\ndriving an entire age to follow one’s will—\nnone have done so without bringing harm upon themselves.\n\nZhang Erqi says:\nThe one who executes is the law.\nThe sage establishes laws in accord with Heaven’s judgment,\nand cannot impose personal bias upon them.\nThis serves as a warning to those of his time\nwho abandoned law for personal whim.\n\nSu Zhe says:\nTo be brave in daring leads to death;\nto be brave in restraint leads to life—\nthis is the constant principle of things.\nYet sometimes the daring survive,\nwhile the restrained do not escape death.\nThe world often gambles on such exceptions,\nneglecting the constant principle.\nHeaven’s Dao is distant—\nwho knows the origin of its likes and dislikes?\nThus even the sage takes the constant as the norm,\never cautious in matters of courage and daring.\nThe world observes Heaven through limited senses,\nseeing only fragments, not the whole.\nWhen good meets misfortune or evil meets fortune,\nnone fail to doubt Heaven’s net as too loose, too flawed.\nOnly by grasping the beginning and end,\nexhausting all transformations,\ncan one know its vastness—\nthough loose, it never fails.\n\nWhen governance is oppressive and punishments severe,\nthe people have nowhere to turn,\nand thus do not fear death—\nthreatening them with death is futile.\nWhen the people are at ease under governance,\nthey cherish life and fear death.\nThen, seizing and executing those who disrupt order—\nwho would dare resist?\n\nThe one who executes is Heaven.\nIn an age of order,\nif those who disrupt and disorder run rampant,\nthey are abandoned by Heaven.\nTo kill them is to carry out Heaven’s will, not one’s own.\nTo kill those not abandoned by Heaven\nis to take the executioner’s place—\nas one who takes the master carpenter’s place in hewing\nrarely avoids injuring his hands,\nso one who takes Heaven’s place in execution\nbrings harm upon himself.\n\nYuan’s note: This reflects Laozi’s compassion for his time\nand his desire to save the world.\nSeeing his era’s reckless use of punishments,\nhe warns: the use of courage must be approached with care.\nThere are those brave in daring,\nwho always insist on killing,\nand those brave in restraint,\nwho always seek to preserve life.\nBoth employ courage,\nyet one brings benefit, the other harm—\nthis must be weighed carefully.\nWhy? Those who are brave in daring and killing\nbelieve they are carrying out Heaven’s detestation,\nso they act resolutely without hesitation.\nYet Heaven’s intent is profound and distant—\nwho truly knows if a person is one Heaven detests?\nThus even the sage, who upholds Heaven’s judgment,\nremains cautious in matters of punishment,\nnever acting lightly.\nWhy? Heaven gives life to all things\nas parents give life to their children—\nits fundamental wish is not to kill.\nYet when they rush toward death,\neven if one wished to spare them, it cannot be done.\nThus the fallen are overturned—\nthis is how Heaven’s vast net,\nthough loose, never lets a single one escape.\nWhy should man presume to take its place?\n\nTherefore, the sage’s punishments\nfollow Heaven’s natural course,\nnever imposing personal will.\nThough his virtue cherishes life,\nhe never fails to execute the guilty.\nThus the net may be wide enough to let a whale pass,\nyet those who act perversely are killed by Heaven’s decree—\nwho would dare defy it?\nThis is what is meant by:\n\"Punish one, and the world is warned;\nexecute four, and the world submits.\"\nFor if I do not dare,\nothers will not dare either.\nIf not so—\nif Heaven’s vast net is met with a meticulous one,\nthe more tightly the law is woven,\nthe more it ensnares,\nand the less people fear death.\nWhy? If I dare, others will dare as well.\nTo follow Heaven is to obey its mandate;\nto take its place is to usurp its power.\nDaring and restraint,\nbenefit and harm—\ncan one not be cautious?\n\nWhen the Hongwu Emperor read *\"The people do not fear death—why threaten them with death?\"*,\nhe was moved with compassion.\nHe abolished the harshest punishments,\nsentencing convicts to labor instead.\nWithin a year, their hearts softened.\nThe words of the humane bring boundless benefit.\n\nThe previous division into two chapters is incorrect. As Wu Cheng noted, this should be read as one. The first part speaks of Heaven’s unknowability and the folly of reckless killing; the latter, of the people’s fearlessness and the same folly. Thus, the former invokes Heaven’s leniency that never fails as instruction, while the latter cites those who would usurp Heaven’s authority to kill as a warning.\n\nWhen the people hunger, it is because their superiors consume too much in taxes—hence their hunger.\nWhen the people are hard to govern, it is because their superiors act with excessive effort—hence their unruliness.\nWhen the people treat death lightly, it is because their superiors pursue ever-greater means to sustain life—hence their disregard for death.\n\nOnly one who does not make life his priority surpasses those who prize life.\n\nThis continues the previous chapter’s theme—*\"The people do not fear death; why threaten them with death?\"*—and elaborates further. *Tax* here means levies. As Wang Bi observed: \"This speaks of the people’s perversity and the disorder of governance—all stemming from above, not below. The people follow their superiors.\" Lü Huiqing remarked: \"When the sage rules from above, without action the people naturally prosper; without desire, they naturally return to simplicity. Thus, there would be no hunger from excessive taxation. Without effort, the people naturally transform; favoring stillness, they naturally stand firm. Thus, there would be no unruliness from excessive action. How then could there be those who, in their lavish pursuit of life, come to treat death lightly?\"\n\nZhang Erqi stated: \"Only one who does not make life his priority—when above, does not overtax or overreach to burden those below; when below, does not defy the law or act treacherously to trouble those above—surpasses those who prize life.\" Yuan’s note: \"When I indulge my own life, others likewise seek to indulge theirs. When all seek to indulge their lives but cannot, how can they not treat death lightly? Thus, the people’s disregard for life arises from their superiors’ lavish pursuit of it. And their lavish pursuit stems from their superiors’ self-indulgence, which both tempts and deprives them. Therefore, one who does not make life his priority clearly surpasses those who prize it. These closing words embody the essence of the Laozi’s teaching. Though spoken in response to prevailing corruption, their meaning runs deep.\"\n\nThe sixty-second chapter:\nWhen people are alive, they are supple and weak;\nwhen they die, they become rigid and strong.\nWhen plants and trees are alive, they are supple and weak;\nwhen they die, they wither and dry.\nThus, the rigid and strong belong to the cohort of death,\nwhile the supple and weak belong to the cohort of life.\nTherefore, when armies are strong, they do not prevail;\nwhen trees are strong, they are felled.\nThe strong and great dwell below;\nthe supple and weak dwell above.\n\nMaster Lü Huiqing says: \"The Dao as a thing is formless and non-contending, thus it is the ultimate suppleness in the world, yet people fail to comprehend it. Therefore, it is illustrated through the tangible: the forms of people and plants alike die through rigidity and strength, and live through suppleness and weakness. How, then, could one who seeks to embody the formless Dao not attain suppleness and weakness? This is the principle that suppleness and weakness overcome rigidity and strength—not merely that armies grow arrogant and are defeated, or that strong trees are felled. Heaven, with its clarity and emptiness, resides above; earth, with its solidity and density, lies below. Ministers serve their superiors through action; rulers govern their subjects through non-action. The principle holds true for all things. Thus, the value of embodying the Dao through suppleness is evident.\"\n\nSu Zhe says: \"Where the harmonizing qi abides, the body is free from the affliction of rigidity and strength. Where the ultimate principle resides, affairs are free from the burden of rigidity and strength. The constant principle of things is that the refined dwells above, while the coarse dwells below. The refined must be supple and weak, while the coarse must be strong and great.\"\n\nWu Cheng says: \"The final two lines follow directly from the preceding two. For armies that are strong are overcome by others, which is not as advantageous as those who overcome through weakness and thus dwell above others. The trunk of a strong tree is near the roots, which is not as advantageous as the branches that dwell above. Extending this principle, one knows that those who pride themselves and domineer others will surely stumble, while those who value humility and suppleness are embraced by the multitude.\"\n\nLi Jiamo says: \"Though suppleness and weakness are not the Dao itself, they approach non-action. Though rigidity and strength have not departed from the Dao, they verge on action. Non-action remains close to the Dao, while action brings fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse in its wake, thus distancing one from the Dao.\"\n\nYuan’s note: As the *Laozi* nears its conclusion, it contrasts the gains and losses of suppleness and weakness versus rigidity and strength, and the following three chapters all elaborate on this theme.\n\nThe sixty-third chapter.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is perhaps like the drawing of a bow. The high is pressed down, the low is lifted up. The excessive is reduced, the deficient is replenished. The Way of Heaven reduces the excessive to replenish the deficient. The way of the ruler is not so: it reduces the deficient to serve the excessive. Who can take what is excessive to serve the world? Only one who possesses the Way.\n\nThus the sage acts yet does not rely on it, achieves success yet does not dwell in it. Does he not wish to display his worth?\n\nThis carries forward the meaning of the previous chapter—how suppleness dwells below and strength above—by illustrating it through the Way of Heaven. As the *Laozi* says: \"To contract it, one must first expand it.\" Thus, drawing the bow is an act of strength. The Way of Heaven detests fullness and favors humility. Just as a drawn bow, if held too long, will slacken, so too will slackness eventually be drawn taut. Therefore, whatever is high must inevitably press itself down, and whatever is low must be lifted; whatever is excessive must inevitably reduce itself, and whatever is diminished must extend. Heaven treats all things in this manner. Humans, however, are not so: they diminish the world’s deficiency to serve their own excess, losing the intent of Heaven. The sage, though possessing the utmost worth, does not wish to display it. This is the daily diminishing of the Way, which must proceed until it is diminished again and again.\n\nSu Zhe says: \"When a bow is drawn, the sinew is above; when relaxed, the horn is above. Thus it serves as an analogy for Heaven’s pressing down the high and lifting up the low. Heaven is impartial, hence it equalizes. Humans are partial, hence they do not equalize. One who possesses the Way nourishes and suffices the myriad things yet declines credit. Having acted for others, one’s own abundance increases; having given to others, one’s own store grows greater. None but one who possesses the Way can endure this. To act and rely on it, to succeed and dwell in it, is to display worth in the world. To display worth in the world is to take one’s excess to serve oneself.\"\n\nLü Huiqing says: \"The Way of Heaven does not deliberately press down the high and lift up the low. By acting without contrivance, it is without partiality; being without partiality, it equalizes. Thus, allowing things to follow their nature, the excessive cannot but be pressed down and reduced, and the deficient cannot but be lifted up and replenished. This is what is meant by 'the reed banner is diminished, humility receives benefit'—such is the Way of Heaven in its time. The way of humans cannot be without contrivance, and being unable to act without contrivance, they cannot be without desire. Being unable to be without desire, they proceed to diminish others to benefit themselves. Only one who possesses the Way knows that nothing has ever truly existed. All the fame and merit of contrived action are but what I possess in excess, while what the world lacks and contends over. Thus, one reduces it to serve the world without claiming possession.\"\n\nWu Cheng says: \"The pressing down and lifting up refer to the drawing of the bow; the reducing and replenishing refer to the Way of Heaven.\"\n\nLu Xisheng says: \"When yang ascends to its utmost in the heavens, it descends; when yin descends to its utmost in the earth, it ascends. This is the image of pressing down the high and lifting up the low, like the drawing of a bow. The Way of Heaven waxes and wanes, intercalating seven times in a chapter. It reduces the excess of the sun to replenish the deficiency of the moon. The way of humans is not so: it diminishes the deficient people to serve the excessive ruler. Who can model the Way of Heaven to become the way of humans? In the *Book of Changes*, diminishing the lower to benefit the upper is called 'diminishing'; diminishing the upper to benefit the lower is called 'benefiting.' The lower is the root.\"\n\nChapter Sixty-Four\n\nNothing in the world is more yielding than water,\n{Yet in overcoming the hard and strong, none can surpass it.}\nNothing can take its place.\n{As nothing can replace its efficacy.}\nThe soft overcomes the hard;\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nThere is none in the world who does not know this,\nYet none can practice it.\n{None know it yet none can put it into action.}\nTherefore the sage declares:\n{Thus the sage declares.}\nOne who can bear the disgrace of the state\nBecomes the lord of the altars of soil and grain;\nOne who can bear the misfortune of the state\nBecomes the king of all under heaven.\n{One who bears the state’s disgrace\nIs called the lord of the altars of soil and grain;\nOne who bears the state’s misfortune\nIs called the king of all under heaven.}\nStraightforward words seem paradoxical.\n{The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.}\n\nThe Master has spoken of this repeatedly, yet many regard it lightly. Thus, though they know it, none can put it into practice. As the text draws to a close, he once more raises the point, saying: Take heed not to treat these words as trivial. For all beings with blood and qi possess the heart of contention. In ordinary times, none fail to recognize the goodness of softness and weakness; yet when disgrace and adversity suddenly strike, they cannot help but flare up—so abruptly does their hardness and strength erupt that they cannot endure it.\n\nMountains and marshes harbor illness; rivers and lakes receive filth; a lord of state bears disgrace. Now, if one clings to talent and strength, ever serving as the nominal master of wisdom, entrusting affairs to the house of schemes—ensnared by the heart of contention—how can one hope to preserve one’s rank as a lord or king? These words may seem contrary to common sentiment, yet they truly embody the upright Dao. The world deems bearing disgrace and misfortune to be calamity.\n\nThe following chapter, “Harmonizing great enmity leaves residual enmity,” further develops this idea. The sage holds the left tally and makes no demand upon others. Thus, one of power attends to the tally; one without power attends to the tax. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality—it ever accords with the good.\n\nThis continues the previous chapter’s theme of bearing disgrace and misfortune, expounding the difficulty of embodying non-contention and selflessness. For softness and weakness are easily applied in times of peace, but difficult when matters arise; bearing petty grudges is easy, while enduring great adversity is hard. If one who studies the Dao forcibly harmonizes great enmity yet harbors hidden anger and lingering resentment within, even if it never erupts, the slightest grievance remains as weighty as a mountain—how then can one speak of attaining the supreme goodness of water’s Way?\n\nWhat is called “power as goodness” means: I treat the good with goodness, and the not-good with goodness as well. This is what the sage means by holding the left tally. A contract has two halves: I hold the left, and if one comes with the right to make a claim, I simply give wealth and goods, never making demands upon others. The sage’s response to all things is effortless and uncontrived—receiving all without refusal, just so.\n\nThe one who comes sees no enmity; the one who gives does not consider it power. Power and enmity both vanish, self and other merge as one—only then has one truly embodied the power of non-contention and selflessness. How can those who merely harmonize enmity compare? For when power is not yet perfected, one remains like those who enforce the tax law, compelling eight households to labor together.\n\nMeasuring fields and dividing them equally is thought to be the height of fairness, yet they do not realize that comparing quantities inevitably leads to contention, where not even a hair’s weight is yielded. Forcing uniformity upon what is inherently unequal only provokes strife. Those who seek to harmonize great enmity merely know to forgive emotions and dismiss grievances, stopping short of excess—but their sense of right and wrong remains clear, and the boundary between self and other does not dissolve. How is this different?\n\nYet does the good person not constantly suffer loss under heaven? The answer: though the good person often bears loss at the hands of others, heaven does not abandon them. Heaven is impartial, aiding only those who embody virtue. Virtue has no fixed teacher; one who gives rise to goodness is its teacher. How could heaven fail to assist a good person who does not claim victory? Thus, the triumph of softness over hardness, of weakness over strength, is radiantly clear. Yet without steadfast insight, one cannot perceive it; without steadfast strength, one cannot uphold it. Therefore, it is said: nothing can replace this.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six**\nLet the state be small, its people few. Let them possess tools of tenfold or hundredfold efficiency yet not employ them. Let the people hold death in awe and not wander far.\n\nThough there be boats and carriages, none shall ride them. Though there be armor and weapons, none shall array them. Let the people return to knotting cords for use.\n\nLet them find sweetness in their food, beauty in their garments, peace in their dwellings, and joy in their customs. Neighboring states may gaze upon one another; the cries of their cocks and dogs may be heard across the land. Yet the people shall grow old and die without ever journeying between them.\n\nIn ancient times, states were many and small; in later ages, states became few and large. With vast territories and teeming populations, even if one wished to return to the governance of high antiquity, it could not be achieved. Thus, Laozi desired to diminish the size of states and reduce their populations.\n\nWu Cheng remarked: Boats, carriages, armor, and weapons cannot be used by one person alone—they are implements for tens or hundreds. When the people are pure and affairs simple, even written contracts may be dispensed with, let alone the tools of many hands. Taking the clothing and food they produce as sweet and fine, and their native customs as peaceful and joyful, they will not willingly migrate afar. Though neighboring lands lie so near that they grow old and die without ever journeying between them, this is more than mere reluctance to travel far.\n\nWang Pang observed: Where states are small and populations sparse, people remain simple and honest. Where states are vast and populations dense, interests clash, and deceit and artifice arise daily. Observe the people of cities and villages—their simplicity and cunning differ markedly. In an age without the Dao, the superficial eclipses the fundamental, and desires for material gain arise from coveting what lies beyond. Thus, the tracks of carriages and footprints crisscross the four directions. Examining the closing passages of the *Analects* and *Mencius*, both extol the deeds of the sage-kings Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang, for when their teachings are applied to governance, it is much the same. Laozi, holding to the virtue of the highest antiquity, lived in a degenerate age, and so his aspirations were thus.\n\nLü Huiqing said: Zhuangzi spoke of the age of utmost virtue, recounting: \"In former times, from the clans of Datingshi and Rongchengshi down to those of Zhurong, Fuxi, and Shennong, the people knotted cords for use. They found sweetness in their food, beauty in their garments, peace in their dwellings, and joy in their customs. Neighboring states gazed upon one another; the cries of their cocks and dogs were heard across the land. Yet the people grew old and died without ever journeying between them.\" Such was not merely Laozi’s vision—it was an ancient Dao indeed. Yet written records begin with the Tang and Yu dynasties, and Laozi sought to return to the governance of remote antiquity. The world had long since departed from high antiquity—could it truly be fully restored? No, it could not. Yet if it could not, why speak of it? In the declining Zhou, refinement and artifice had utterly vanquished simplicity and sincerity. Only the great Dao could restore people to the essence of their nature. To speak of the Dao without addressing the age is insufficient to grasp how the great Dao has been tested. This is why Laozi necessarily returned to the governance of high antiquity.\n\nRites reached their perfection in the synthesis of the Three Dynasties; music attained its fullness in the refinement of the Six Eras. Yet one does not place dark water beneath sweet wine or add shrill pipes above the clear tones of the *shu* and *yue* flutes. This is to make people understand that the rites and music of later ages were unavoidable, and that the proper return to the root is thus. Hearing of antiquity, where implements of tens were unused and boats, carriages, armor, and weapons were not arrayed, one realizes that mobilizing great affairs and vast multitudes is not done by choice. Hearing that the people knotted cords to govern and grew old and died without journeying between lands, one sees that elaborate laws and wearying decrees, the ceaseless coming and going of wheels and hooves, are also not by choice. How then could one willingly impose troublesome affairs to deepen the faults of the people? To wish the world not to be peaceful and secure would be impossible. Had Laozi perished without speaking, it would be like removing dark water and clearing the shrill pipes—who would then understand the frugality of rites and the moderation of music as the intent to return to the root and restore the beginning? The Han, succeeding the Qin, ultimately achieved near-abolition of punishments through non-action and tranquility. Thus, the words of the perfected one were no small contribution.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven**\nTruthful words are not fine; fine words are not truthful. The good do not dispute; the disputatious are not good. The wise are not broadly learned; the broadly learned are not wise. The sage does not accumulate. Having acted for others, he possesses more. Having given to others, he has more. The Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm. The Dao of the sage acts and does not contend.\n\nWang Bi said: Truthful words are not fine—they reside in substance and plainness. The good do not dispute—their root lies in simplicity. The wise are not broadly learned—their ultimate lies in unity. \"He possesses more\" means he is revered by all things. \"He has more\" means all things return to him. \"Benefits and does not harm\" means its movement constantly generates and completes.\n\nWu Cheng said: This final chapter of the text speaks thus, and so it is peaceful, simple, uncontentious, and unlearned. For it is truly good and truly wise, and thus all its words are real, without embellishment to make them fine. \"Does not accumulate\" means emptiness and nothingness. Being empty and nothing, its responses are inexhaustible. To regard accumulation as possession is to limit one’s responses—how could one then possess more and have more? Zhuangzi, describing Laozi’s learning, said: \"To regard accumulation as insufficiency, to have no hoarding and thus have surplus\"—this is what is meant. \"Benefit\" is the opposite of \"harm\"; \"act\" is the origin of \"contend.\" To benefit through non-benefit is thus to avoid harm. To act through non-action is thus to avoid contention. To avoid contention is to be without self; to be without self is to act without acting.\n\nJiao Hong said: Laozi’s text, if one receives and savors it, approaches the fine. If one exhausts the principles of the myriad things without omission, it approaches disputation and broad learning. Yet why is it said to be truthful and not fine, good and not disputatious, wise and not broadly learned? Because the five thousand words all speak of the Dao of non-accumulation. Non-accumulation means the mind is unbound, and thus words are as if without words. Therefore, it is not that he does not act for others, but he never divides what he possesses. It is not that he does not give to others, but he never diminishes his abundance. What harm then in disputation and broad learning? If one merely clings to opinions and contends with the world, one becomes like those whose many words lead to exhaustion—this is not the Dao of Heaven. The scholar, understanding this, should empty the mind and forget words.\n\nThus, with this, one has grasped more than half the meaning of the entire text.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 68** *(Yao Nai divides the lines \"truthful and not fine\" into one chapter, \"the sage does not accumulate\" into another, and \"the Way of Heaven\" into yet another—this arrangement is not adopted here.)*\n\n**Appendix**\n*Shuo Yuan* states:\nChang Cong was gravely ill. Laozi went to inquire after him.\n\"Master,\" he said, \"your illness is severe. Have you no final words to leave your disciples?\"\nChang Cong replied, \"Though you did not ask, I shall tell you. When passing one’s hometown, one dismounts—do you understand?\"\nLaozi said, \"Is this not to show that one does not forget one’s origins?\"\n\"When passing an ancient tree, one quickens one’s pace—do you understand?\"\nLaozi said, \"Is this not to show reverence for the aged?\"\nChang Cong opened his mouth wide and said to Laozi, \"Is my tongue still here?\"\nLaozi said, \"Yes.\"\n\"Are my teeth still here?\"\nLaozi said, \"Gone.\"\n\"Do you understand?\"\nLaozi said, \"Is this not that the soft endures while the hard perishes?\"\nChang Cong sighed, \"Ah.\"\n\nThe affairs of the world are all encompassed herein. What more could I say to you? *(The* Gaoshi Zhuan *renders this as Shang Rong. The* Shishuo Xinyu *notes: \"Shang Rong, an elder teacher.\")*\n\n*Zhuangzi* states:\nWhen Lao Dan died, Qin Shi went to offer condolences. He wailed three times and departed.\nHis disciples said, \"Was he not your friend?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then is such a brief mourning fitting?\"\n\"Yes. At first, I took him for a man of the Dao, but now I see he was not. When I entered to offer condolences, I saw elders weeping for him as if for their own children, and the young weeping as if for their own mothers. In their gathering, there must have been those who spoke without seeking to speak, who wept without seeking to weep. This is to flee from Heaven and betray one’s nature, forgetting what one has received. The ancients called this the punishment of fleeing from Heaven. When he came, it was his time; when he departed, he followed the natural course. Abiding in the proper time and following the natural order, sorrow and joy cannot enter. The ancients called this the Great Release. It is like the flame passed from torch to torch—one does not know when it ends.\"\n\nThe *Records of the Grand Historian*, in the \"Hereditary House of Confucius,\" states:\nNangong Jingshu of Lu said to the Lord of Lu, \"I request to accompany Confucius to Zhou.\"\nThe Lord of Lu provided them with a carriage, two horses, and a young attendant. Together, they went to Zhou.\n\nWhen inquiring about ritual, he likely met with Laozi. As he took his leave, Laozi saw him off, saying: \"I have heard that the wealthy and noble see others off with gifts of wealth, while the humane see others off with words. Though I cannot claim wealth or nobility, I have presumptuously taken the name of the humane. Thus, I see you off with these words:\n\n'Those sharp in perception and keen in discernment, yet near to death—these are they who delight in criticizing others. Those broad in eloquence and vast in knowledge, yet endangering their own lives—these are they who expose the faults of others. As a son, do not act as though you possess a self. As a minister, do not act as though you possess a self.'\n\nConfucius returned from Zhou to Lu, and his disciples gradually increased in number.\n\nThe *Records of the Grand Historian*, in the \"Arrayed Traditions of Confucius’ Disciples,\" states:\nThose whom Confucius revered and served included Laozi in Zhou, Qu Boyu in Wei, Yan Pingzhong in Qi, Lao Laizi in Chu, Zichan in Zheng, and Meng Gongchuo in Lu.\n\nThe *Records of Ritual*, in the \"Zengzi’s Questions,\" states:\nZengzi asked: \"In ancient times, when a teacher traveled, would he necessarily take the ancestral tablets with him?\"\nConfucius said: \"When the Son of Heaven made his imperial tours, he took the ancestral tablets with him, carrying them in the grand chariot. This was to show that there must always be reverence. Now, if one were to take the tablets of all seven ancestral temples on a journey, this would be a mistake. The seven temples and five temples should never lack their tablets. The only times when tablets are absent are when the Son of Heaven has passed, when a feudal lord has died, when one has left one’s state, or when the tablets are used in the ancestral sacrifice—only then are there no tablets. I have heard from Lao Dan that when the Son of Heaven passes or a feudal lord dies, the invocators gather the tablets of all the ancestral temples and store them in the ancestral temple. This is ritual. After the final wailing and the completion of the mourning rites, the tablets are returned to their respective temples. When a lord leaves his state, the Grand Steward takes the tablets of all the ancestral temples to accompany him. This is ritual. When the ancestral sacrifice is performed, the invocators welcome the tablets of the four ancestral temples. When the tablets leave or enter the temple, the path must be cleared.\"\n\nLao Dan also said...\"\n\nWhen the funeral procession reaches the burial path and there is a solar eclipse, should there be a change in the rites—or not? Confucius said: \"Formerly, I followed Lao Dan to assist in a burial at the Lane Ward. When we reached the burial path, there was a solar eclipse. Lao Dan said: 'Qiu, halt the coffin and draw it to the right of the path. Cease wailing and listen for changes. Only after the sun returns should we proceed.' He called this ritual. After the burial, I asked him: 'A coffin cannot be returned once it has left. When there is a solar eclipse, one cannot know whether its end will be delayed or swift—so why not proceed?' Lao Dan said: 'When feudal lords attend court before the Son of Heaven, they set out at sunrise and make offerings only when the sun has set. When grand officers or knights are on missions, they set out at sunrise and rest only when the sun has set. A coffin does not leave early nor lodge late; only criminals and those hastening to their parents’ funerals travel by starlight. When there is a solar eclipse, how can one know the stars will not appear? Moreover, the noble person performs rites without causing distress to the kin of the deceased.' I have heard this from Lao Dan.\" He continued:\n\nZixia asked: \"After the three-year mourning period concludes with the final wailing, there is no avoidance of military service—is this a ritual principle, or was it initially a matter for officials?\" Confucius said: \"In the Xia dynasty’s three-year mourning, affairs resumed after the encoffining. The Yin people resumed affairs after the burial. The Record states: 'The noble person does not deprive others of their kin, nor may one be deprived of one’s own kin.' This is what it means.\" Zixia said: \"Then is the rule that military service cannot be avoided not correct?\" Confucius said: \"I have heard from Lao Dan that in former times, the Duke of Lu, Bo Qin, acted for a reason. But to follow the profit of three-year mourning today—I do not understand it.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: Confucius went west to deposit books in the Zhou archives. Zilu counseled: \"I have heard that among the Zhou’s archivists there is one named Lao Dan, who has retired and returned home. If you wish to deposit books, you might try going through him.\" Confucius said: \"Very well.\" He went to see Lao Dan.\n\nIt is also said: Confucius was fifty-one years old and had not yet heard the Dao, so he went south to Pei to see Lao Dan. Lao Dan said: \"Have you come? I have heard you are a worthy man of the northern regions. Have you attained the Dao?\"\n\nIt is further said: Laozi saw five of Confucius’ disciples and asked: \"Who is this in front?\" They replied: \"Zilu is brave and strong. Next is Zigong, who is wise. Zengzi is filial. Yan Hui is humane. Zizhang is martial.\" Laozi sighed.\n\nI have heard that in the south there is a bird called the phoenix. Where the phoenix dwells, mountains of piled stone stretch a thousand *li*, and the waters of the Yellow River flow beneath. The phoenix alights there, and Heaven provides its food. The trees there are called *qiong*, their branches rising a hundred *ren* high, bearing fruits of *qiulin* and *langgan*. Heaven also produces *limi* grain, and a one-headed, three-faced being takes turns rising to guard the *langgan*. The markings of the phoenix bear sagely wisdom upon its crown and humane virtue upon its breast, with intelligence to its left and worthiness to its right.\n\nIt is also said: Confucius was reading the *Spring and Autumn Annals* when Lao Dan, squatting by the stove with a wine vessel, listened.\n\nThe *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals* states: A man of Jing lost his bow and was unwilling to search for it, saying, \"A man of Jing lost it; a man of Jing will find it. Why search?\" When Confucius heard this, he said, \"Remove the word 'Jing,' and it would suffice.\" When Lao Dan heard it, he said, \"Remove the word 'man,' and it would suffice.\"\n\nThe *Garden of Persuasions* in its \"Reverence and Caution\" chapter records Laozi as saying: \"When you gain what benefits you, you must consider what harms you. When you delight in what you have achieved, you must reflect on what may ruin it. Heaven rewards those who do good with fortune and punishes those who do evil with misfortune. Thus it is said: Misfortune leans upon fortune, and fortune lies hidden within misfortune. Be warned, be cautious. If a noble person does not strive, how can they prepare? One who understands Heaven does not lose the seasons; one who understands Earth does not lose resources. If you are vigilant day and night, you will avoid disaster.\"\n\nXunzi said: When Confucius visited Zhou, he entered the temple of Hou Ji. Before the steps on the right stood a bronze figure with three seals upon its mouth and an inscription on its back that read: \"An ancient man cautious of speech. Be warned! Be warned! Do not speak excessively—excessive speech leads to many failures. Do not act excessively—excessive action leads to many troubles. In comfort and joy, remain vigilant. Do not do what you may regret. Do not say, 'What harm is there?'—for calamity will grow. Do not say, 'What danger is there?'—for calamity will swell. Do not say, 'What ruin is there?'—for calamity will ignite. Do not say, 'No one hears'—for the spirits watch over men. A flame that does not cease—how can it not bring fiery disaster? A trickle that is not dammed—it will become a great river. A thread that does not break—it may become a net. A twig that is not snapped—it will require an axe. If you are truly cautious, this is the root of fortune. To say, 'What harm is there?' is the gate of misfortune. The violent do not meet a natural death. Those who love to prevail will meet their match. Thieves hate their masters; the people resent their superiors. The noble person knows that none in the world can be placed above them, so they humble themselves. They know that none among the multitude can be placed before them, so they follow behind. With warmth, reverence, and careful virtue, they make others admire them. Holding to the feminine and keeping low, none can surpass them. While others rush toward that, I alone hold to this. While others are confused, I alone do not waver. I conceal my wisdom within and do not display my skills. Though I may be exalted, others will not harm me. Who can do this? Though the Yangtze and the sea lie to the left, they surpass the hundred rivers because they are low. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality—it constantly bestows upon the good.\"\n\nWhen Confucius had finished reading this text, he turned to his disciples and said, \"Remember this well. These words are true and hit the mark, sincere and trustworthy.\"\n\nWang Yinglin said: The *Imperial Survey* records that Wu Ren asked Grand Duke Wang, \"May I hear the admonitions of the Five Emperors?\" The Grand Duke replied, \"The admonition of the Yellow Emperor states: 'When I dwell above the people, I tremble with fear that evening may not come until morning.' Thus he made a bronze figure with three seals upon its mouth, saying, 'An ancient man cautious of speech.' According to the *Records of Arts and Letters*, among the Daoist texts are six chapters of the Yellow Emperor’s inscriptions. Cai Yong’s *Inscriptions and Admonitions* mentions the Yellow Emperor’s method of the *jinji*. The *Imperial Survey* was compiled during the reign of Emperor Wen of Wei, when the books from the *Seven Summaries* of the Han still existed. The *Inscription of the Bronze Figure* was likely one of the six chapters. He Mengchun said: Among the admonitions, phrases like 'A thread that does not break may become a net' and 'A twig that is not snapped will require an axe' also appear in the *Bamboo Annals of Ji Tomb*. The lines 'Thieves hate their masters; the people resent their superiors' are also cited by the wife of Bo Zong in the *Zuozhuan*. This shows they were ancient sayings. As for their main purport, they align with the writings of Laozi. For instance, 'If you are truly cautious, this is the root of fortune; to say, \"What harm is there?\" is the gate of misfortune' corresponds to Laozi’s 'Misfortune leans upon fortune; fortune lies hidden within misfortune.' The line 'The violent do not meet a natural death' corresponds to Laozi’s 'The hard and strong are companions of death.' The lines 'Knowing that none in the world can be placed above them, so they humble themselves; knowing that none among the multitude can be placed before them, so they follow behind' correspond to Laozi’s 'To lead the people, one must speak as though beneath them; to guide the people, one must place oneself behind them.' However, Laozi’s desire to lead and guide stems from self-interest, whereas this text is more impartial. The line 'Holding to the feminine and keeping low, none can surpass them' corresponds to Laozi’s 'Putting oneself behind, one advances; setting oneself aside, one endures.' The line 'While others rush toward that, I alone hold to this' corresponds to Laozi’s 'Know the masculine, hold to the feminine; know the honorable, hold to the humble.' The line 'While others are confused, I alone do not waver' corresponds to Laozi’s 'Dwelling where the multitude shuns, the multitude all have more than enough, while I alone seem lacking.' The line 'I conceal my wisdom within and do not display my skills' corresponds to Laozi’s 'Harmonizing one’s light, blending with the dust; the multitude are bright, I alone am dim.' The line 'Though the Yangtze and the sea lie to the left, they surpass the hundred rivers because they are low' corresponds to Laozi’s 'The reason the Yangtze and the sea can be kings of the hundred valleys is that they excel at being low.' Thus, the noble person values the left. The line 'The Way of Heaven shows no partiality—it constantly bestows upon the good' is also found in Laozi.\"\n\nThe *Book of the Zhou Archivist* thus proves not to be without foundation, and the reason Huang-Lao are jointly invoked may also be traced to this source.\n\n**Postscript:**\nMaster Hugong’s *Exhortation to Study* fiercely denounces Laozi, claiming that he became the refuge for later figures like Zhang Yu, Kong Guang, Hu Guang, and Feng Dao—those who outwardly stole the name of the humane while covertly sowing chaos throughout the realm, causing the principles of the Dao and the standards of law to crumble in obscurity. Hence his vehement condemnation.\n\nConfucius despised the village worthies, yet the village worthies’ twisted learning and sycophantic worldliness—whether the likes of Li Si and Gongsun Hong, who were either renegades of Xunzi’s school or falsely draped themselves in Confucian garb—all began with some ulterior motive. As for the more recent village worthies, ignorant and unskilled yet blending with the dust and harmonizing their light, they merely flatter and drift, harming the teachings of the age. They belong in the *Biographies of Flatterers and Favorites*, not among those who claim Laozi’s mantle.\n\nLaozi’s upright words seem paradoxical: he governs the state with uprightness, employs the military with cunning, takes deep roots and tranquil extremes as his essence, and conceals his capacity to await the right moment as his function. Though distinct from the orthodox learning of the Six Arts, his meaning is profound and far-reaching, with few able to grasp its full import. Liu Zhiji dismissed the *Heshang Gong* commentary as spurious, while followers like Yan Junping, Wang Bi, and Fu Yi—though lacking the means to plumb its depths—have been among the few across the ages who intuitively understood its intent. Sima Qian’s critiques and the grand essentials of the masters, along with the *Records of the Grand Historian*’s brief classification of the Daoist school, scarcely suffice to convey it.\n\nIn the early years of the Western Han, the prevailing ethos saw Laozi eclipse the Confucians. After the Taichu era of Emperor Wu, the Six Classics gradually came to light, and the Confucians eclipsed Laozi. Those who truly grasped the Dao of Lao Dan—Emperor Taizong Wen, the Marquis of Liu, Gai Gong, Emperor Guangwu of the Later Han, Ji An with his forthright speech, and the two Shu brothers with their prescience—all achieved governance through it. Those who failed to grasp it, like Yang Xiong, were mere literary scholars, not Daoists, and utterly missed its practical application.\n\nThose who merely dwell in obscurity for self-preservation merely resemble the Dao without truly embodying it. Yi Yin, the Grand Duke, Guan Zhong, and Ji Ran were all Daoists—adept at turning misfortune into fortune and defeat into triumph. The *Golden Tablets* and *Six Strategies* contain the arts of seizing states and governing the world, which Confucians, constrained by their rigid doctrines, dare not speak of. Outwardly, they cultivated the fundamental governance of tranquility, emptiness, and prudence; inwardly, they harbored the applications of resilience, concealment, consolidation, and strategic maneuvering. When restrained, they were profoundly deep; when at rest, they were endlessly subtle. Discerning the moment and striking once, they shattered all opposition. Compared to the rulers who wielded control, they embodied the mastery of \"specializing in qi to achieve suppleness\" and \"emptiness as the root of all things,\" returning to the One without leaving traces of deliberate action. Thus, their legacy branched into Legalism, the *Yin Fu Jing*, and military strategy—yet these remain but superficial forms, far removed from the essence. The Dao of Laozi ever resides in the yin to govern the yang, abides in stillness to observe motion, nurtures obscurity to await clarity, and employs softness to master hardness. This stands in stark contrast to the practices of Zhuangzi and Liezi, who refined their spirit and soared beyond the world. Hence, it is called the art of the ruler facing south.\n\nAnnotations and commentaries number in the dozens or hundreds. {The Ming founder’s annotated edition is unseen, yet the Ming founder, though employing Laozi’s teachings, degenerated into the poison of Shen Buhai and Han Fei—precisely due to misinterpreting the sage’s words on \"impartiality toward the myriad things as straw dogs.\"} Few have delved deeply into its essence. Only Shao Yao’s remark that \"Laozi grasped the essence of the *Yi*\" and Zhu Xi’s discussions in *Classified Conversations*—such as \"the ruler’s guiding principles\" and other passages—reveal its fundamental origins, clarifying its methods. These stand in irreconcilable opposition to the teachings of Zhuangzi and Buddhism, like ice and charcoal. Wu Cailu and Zhang Haoran also offered subtle insights. Among recent scholars, Yu Yue’s exegesis of Laozi excels in philological analysis and parsing of syntax. During the Daoguang and Xianfeng eras, Wei Shi of Shaoyang elucidated its original meaning, pruning the excesses of various schools and incorporating his own interpretations to yield richer insights.\n\nAt the request of Yang Renshan, I had previously included Jiao Hong’s *Laozi’s Wings* in the canon repository. Later, I commissioned Fang Xiaolang to transcribe Wei Shi’s commentary. The printing was completed in the spring of the *jihai* year. My hurried return to the north left no time to meticulously collate errors and omissions. Reflecting on my own life—like Lu Zhan, I have withdrawn from the world, and in office, I have been but a mediocre functionary, never daring to confront the court with forthright remonstrance—how could I presume to falsely claim lineage from the ancient county of Ku, betraying Master Hupo’s orthodox teachings? Yet lamenting the scarcity of commentators who truly grasp its intent, this annotation offers considerable merit in dredging and clarifying its depths. It cannot be dismissed. Thus, I record the circumstances of its collation and publication.\n\nOn the last day of the fourth month of *gengzi*, this preface was lost due to adversity. In the winter of *gengzi*, upon re-entering the capital, I recovered two pages from the rubble of a ruined residence—pages marked and revised by my late father. I have now carefully reprinted them, adding six circles in accordance with the original markings.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by the unworthy son Liang Su in the tenth month of *renyin*.",

      "translated_text": "**On Laozi**\n\n**I.**\nWas the learning of Wen, Jing, and Cao Shen truly deeper than that of Ji, Ruan, Wang, or He? Yet in the Western Han and Western Jin, the people of Yan and Yue took Zhuangzi for Laozi, while the Han took Laozi for Laozi. Was this true only of Zhuangzi? From Han Fei downward, a thousand schools have offered interpretations of *Laozi*. Laozi himself is no longer alive—who can settle the matter? Each clings to a single phrase and obstructs the meaning of the *Five Thousand Words*. They take and give, open and close—what does this have to do with non-action and purity? They treat the myriad things as straw dogs—what does this have to do with compassion, salvation, and protection? They speak of the Mysterious Female and long life—what does this have to do with putting the self last and setting the body aside? Fixating on one part and slandering the whole, the *Five Thousand Words* become like ears, eyes, mouth, and nose, each unable to communicate with the others.\n\nWithout grasping the *Dao* as the root of words or the lord of affairs, they merely chase echoes and shadows at the periphery. How could such a *Dao*—easy to know, easy to practice—remain unknown and unpracticed to this day, leaving the world in confusion? Laozi said: *\"Existence is for benefit; non-existence is for function.\"* He was not unaware that existence and non-existence cannot be separated. Yet while the world understands the benefit of existence, it does not comprehend the function of non-existence. Thus, he constantly pointed to the nameless and concealed function in the unseen. Reducing again and again, he arrived at non-action. The *Dao* of non-action must begin with the absence of desire.\n\nThe various masters, unable to eliminate desire, merely admired non-action. Thus, their yin-like stillness and endurance only deepened their mechanisms and fulfilled their desires. Zhuang Zhou was free of desire, yet he did not understand the suppleness of its function. Liezi attained suppleness, yet he did not grasp that non-existence cannot be separated from existence. Thus, Zhuangzi and Liezi took function as substance, but their substance was not the true substance. Shen Buhai, Han Fei, Guiguzi, and Fan Li took substance as function, but their function was not the true function. Why not return to the root? What is the root? It is precisely what is called the *Dao* as lord and master.\n\nTo the myriad things, it is the Mother; to man, it is the infant; to the world, it is the King of the Hundred Grains; to the age, it is the Great Antiquity; in function, it is the feminine, the lowly, the mysterious. Thus, those like Gai Gong and Huangshi gathered it into their persons, subtly and perfectly, so that their own bodies became like those of the era of Fuxi. Extending this to the world, they removed excess and extravagance, transforming the cruel and violent Qin into the Wen and Jing eras, where punishments were set aside—was this not the era of Fuxi reborn in later ages? How could it compare to the minor functions and minor harms of legalism, pure talk, and immortality-seeking, or the great functions and great harms of such pursuits?\n\nWe see the infant as if it were yesterday. The myriad things have never been separated from the Mother for a single day. The Hundred Grains have never been apart from their King for a single day. Movement reaches its extreme and must return to stillness; the high reaches its extreme and must return to the low; brilliance reaches its extreme and must return to obscurity. If this is so, then not a single thing fails to return to its root, and not a single day lacks the Great Antiquity. Seek the original mind in the *Five Thousand Words* and you will find it; seek the *Five Thousand Words* in the original mind and nothing will be lacking. A hundred changes do not depart from the root—why trouble oneself with fragmented seeking? Return to the root, and desire is eliminated; eliminate desire, and suppleness is attained. Thus, in non-action, nothing is left undone.\n\nWith this in mind, read the books of the Great Antiquity—perhaps, perhaps!\n\n**II.**\nLaozi’s *Dao* is the *Dao* of the Great Antiquity; his book is the book of the Great Antiquity. How can this be verified? It is verified by the *Records of the Grand Historian*. The state historians were custodians of the books of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. Thus, the Left Historian in Chu could read the ancient texts, and Confucius, when he visited Zhou, also inquired of Lao Dan. Now, examining Laozi’s chapter on *\"The Valley Spirit never dies,\"* Liezi cites it as a book of the Yellow Emperor. Some even claim that the *Five Thousand Words* are all the writings of Rong Cheng. Moreover, the text refers to *\"what the ancients called,\"* *\"it is said in established words,\"* *\"the sage says,\"* and *\"there are words on the use of arms.\"* Thus, Ban Gu said that the Daoists emerged from the ancient historians, and Zhuangzi also said that the *Dao* of antiquity had its place in this. Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard of its influence and delighted in it—is this not clear evidence of transmission rather than creation?\n\nConfucius, observing the Zhou temple, praised the inscription on the metal man, words that seemed to come from Laozi’s own mouth. Examining the *Huanglan* and *Jinkui*, the *Three Seals Inscription* of the metal man was one of the *Six Inscriptions of the Yellow Emperor* recorded in the Han *Records*, the very source of the Yellow Emperor-Laozi lineage. The *Hidden Chamber* and *Records of the Grand Historian* were rich in knowledge and discernment. Those who studied them found what resonated with their nature. Thus, Laozi’s book, such as its discussion of mourning rites and the meaning of victory in war, shows deep understanding of ritual, while his words on *\"losing the Dao and then virtue, losing virtue and then benevolence, losing benevolence and then propriety\"* reveal his profound disdain for the misapplication of ritual in the degenerate age. The more he detested it, the more earnestly he longed for antiquity; the more earnestly he longed, the more deeply he sought. Embracing virtue and holding to the *Dao*, he wrote his book in old age, his intent nothing less than to return this world to the purity of the Great Antiquity.\n\nThe transformations of *qi* follow one another like cold and heat. The Great Antiquity could not but give way to the Tang, Yu, and Three Dynasties; the Tang, Yu, and Three Dynasties could not but give way to later ages. Even within a single family, from great-grandfather to father and son, there are differences. Thus, loyalty, substance, and refinement each arose in turn to remedy excesses, and when excesses reach their extreme, there is a return to the beginning. Confucius preferred frugality over extravagance as the root of ritual, seeking to use loyalty and substance to remedy the excess of refinement. Thus, Laozi’s teachings of purity, simplicity, loyalty, and trust cannot be said to be untimely—they were the harbinger of the Western Han’s resurgence.\n\nYet Confucius edited the *Book of Documents* beginning with Tang and Yu, while Laozi focused exclusively on the *Three August Ones* and above. The greater the distance, the more their positions seem opposed. Thus, his discussions often seem excessively lofty, but this is the natural tendency of his learning, not a deliberate exaggeration. The *Heshang Gong* said: *\"Laozi spoke of my three treasures: first, compassion; second, frugality; third, not daring to be first in the world.\"* Is compassion not benevolence? Is frugality not righteousness? Is not daring to be first not propriety? The *Book of Changes* says: *\"Virtue speaks of abundance; ritual speaks of reverence.\"* It also says: *\"In the past, I had former upright officials whose words were clear and pure.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Laozi possesses this essence. Yet does this mean the Dao of the Grand Antiquity was utterly useless in the world? Or was the world capable of that antiquity while people failed to employ it? It is said: the sage’s works are books for ordering the world, while Laozi’s is a book for saving the world. Had he lived in the age of the Zhou when every household was worthy of enfeoffment, he would have remained silent. But in any other era, his injunctions to eliminate excess, extravagance, and excessiveness would surely find validation in the world. Governance began with the Yellow Emperor, reached completion under Yao, attained perfection in the Three Dynasties, and was annihilated by Qin. When the Han’s qi and fortune were re-created, the people were delivered from fire and water and settled upon their mats—this was no less than the Grand Antiquity. Thus, Cao Shen and the Wen and Jing emperors carved away ornament to restore simplicity, cast nets so wide they let leviathans slip through, and the world was transformed by their influence. For the poisonous sores of Qin and the harsh remedies of Xiang Yu’s brutal rule, a single dose of cool, harmonious relief—gradually administered like food and drink—brought recovery without medicine. When illness arises from medicine itself, even non-treatment may strike the right cure, aligning in principle with the perfected person’s teaching of being free from illness. Who says the degenerate age and the Grand Antiquity are as incompatible as dream and waking?\n\nConsider an infant at the breast: its faculties unopened, scolding and prohibitions are useless—this is the non-action of the Grand Antiquity. As it grows with its celestial purity yet unspoiled, it has no openings for desires, no sprouts of cunning—this is the non-action of the Middle Antiquity. When it errs and is gradually admonished and enlightened, without coercion that might provoke rupture—this is the non-action of the degenerate age. Though the times differ, non-action differs with them, yet the heart of the Grand Antiquity has never been abandoned for a single day. How could it be a matter of stiffening like a wooden puppet while transformation flows like spirit?\n\nLaozi’s book encompasses antiquity and the present, bridging high and low. Those above—Fuxi and Guan Yin—governed by illuminating the Dao. Those in the middle—Cao Shen and the Wen and Jing emperors—governed to save the world. Those below—the Hongwu Emperor, who recited “the people do not fear death” and thus diminished his heart, and the Song Taizu, who heard the warning against fine weapons and changed countenance—acted thus.

      "translated_text": "Deep sees deeply, shallow sees shallowly. I cannot attain the Dao and so rely on qi. Thus, drawn to its countermeasures, I return to it again and again.\n\nAlas! The Dao is one and nothing more. When Laozi emerged, it became two; when the Hundred Schools arose, it became a hundred. Does the world truly have so many disparate Ways? Laozi alone, with Guan Yin as his near-perfect embodiment, had nothing more to claim. His teachings passed to Lie Yukou, Yang Zhu, and Zhuang Zhou, giving rise to the learning of emptiness, the learning of self, and the learning of unbridled freedom. Liezi’s emptiness approaches that of the Buddhists, yet his nature is profound and his meaning abstruse—never did he exalt the self or denigrate others, exalt himself to revile the sages, or deceive the foolish to assert his own rightness. He harbored no enmity toward the world. Yang Zhu was revered by the School of Names, Zhuang Zhou by the Jin scholars. Factions arose, each enslaving the other, branching into two streams beyond the pale.\n\nYangzi’s “for me” follows non-action; Zhuangzi’s unrestrainedness follows spontaneity. Yet can spontaneity not govern the self, or non-action not govern the world? Laozi’s spontaneity arises from the utmost emptiness and deepest stillness, grasping the most rigorous and precise essence as its foundation. It desires stillness, not restlessness; weight, not lightness; frugality, not excess. It values tolerance over severity, reverence over license, essentials over trivialities. Thus, in affairs, it always follows rather than initiates, moves only under compulsion, and does not act before necessity. This is what is called spontaneity—how could mere dissipation be spontaneity?\n\nHis non-action in governing the world does not mean governing by not governing, but governing by not governing. Merit remains because it is not claimed; fame is uncontested because it is not contended. Difficulties are resolved in their ease, so they never become difficult. Rare goods are not prized, yet useful things are not discarded. Arms are used only when unavoidable—this is not to say they are never used. Excess, extravagance, and excessiveness are removed, but ordinary affairs are not abandoned. Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish: merely not harming it is how it is preserved.",

Laozi spoke of rejecting benevolence and abandoning righteousness, yet his heart could not bear it, nor did he dare to act. His intent never ceased to move within these bounds. Zhuang Zhou, however, wandered carefree through the world, disdained power and profit, and rebuked emperors and kings. He wearied of ritual and law, even slandering the sages as thieves. As for the scholars of Wei and Jin, their lack of desire fell short of Zhou’s, and they did not truly grasp what it meant to govern the world through non-action. They dismissed everything as chaff, folded their hands, and claimed governance without action. In the end, the royal net unraveled, and all things shattered. The Legalists then sought to enforce strict discipline, submitting all things to the law, believing they could achieve purity and order. Thus, they restrained others’ desires while indulging their own, embraced boldness in daring while shunning restraint, and practiced cruelty in what they called endurance while rejecting true forbearance. The warm, solitary benevolence and righteousness receded, while cold, thin morality advanced. Was this entirely the Dao of Laozi? Or was it entirely not the Dao of Laozi?",

      "translated_text": "The Huang-Lao school observed the transformations of the ten thousand things in stillness, grasping the pivot of their opening and closing. Only by restraining the counterflow of one’s nature and enduring it could stillness overcome motion, the female master the male, and softness triumph over hardness. To ascend, one must first descend; to know the masculine, one must guard the feminine. By placing the self outside, the self is preserved; through selflessness, one achieves one’s private ends. This is what is meant by \"reversal is the movement of the Dao, and weakness is the function of the Dao.\"\n\nLater generations, with their hearts set on hasty gains and profit, sought the substance of desirelessness but could not attain it, instead grasping only its contrary mechanism. Thus, they erred in excess or deficiency of the heart—how could they avoid bias and corruption? Laozi was ever cautious, never daring to put himself before others, never willing to harm them. Yet scholars merely seized upon his excesses—his loftiness, his intensity—delighting in what seemed easy, simple, and direct, while inwardly they tore apart his teachings to suit themselves. Such perverse and mistaken views were the cause.\n\nIn the \"Under Heaven\" chapter, Zhuangzi styled himself a \"celestial man,\" placing himself above the \"true man\" and the \"perfected man.\" Han Fei, in his *Explication of Laozi*, went further, dismissing the teachings of tranquility and the insubstantial words of the indistinct as useless doctrines. Could these truly be called followers of Laozi’s school, clinging to it with such scrupulousness?\n\nAmong the Han scholars of the Huang-Lao tradition, Gai Gong, Cao Shen, and Ji An practiced a learning for engagement with the world; Shu Guang and Liu De embodied a learning of contentment; the Four Whiteheads exemplified a learning of reclusion. Zhang Liang, like a dragon, moved freely among these three, embodying their essence and function with ease.

In Buddhism, this is termed \"playing with light and appearances,\" never transcending the consciousness-spirit, and thus failing to return to the true ocean of quiescence. Why? Laozi illuminates life, while the Buddha illuminates death. Laozi engages with the world, while the Buddha transcends it. Laozi’s is the Dao of China’s high antiquity, while the Buddha’s is the teaching beyond the Six Directions. Thus, among those who drew near to Chan, only Liezi did so, for Laozi fundamentally does not align with Chan.\n\nSince the Song dynasty, those who delight in Chan have largely dragged Laozi into Buddhism. The *Classic* states: \"When the people do not fear authority, great authority arrives.\" Su Ziyou, however, claimed that if one is free from the delusive views of life and death, gain and loss, and abides in fearless equanimity, then the great authority of the luminous and vast nature within oneself will manifest resplendently before them. How is this different from calling a deer a horse, or planting millet only to harvest barnyard grass? To honor Laozi by distorting him, to invoke the Buddha while slandering him—when the two are conflated, both are harmed. How much better to keep them apart, so both may remain beautiful?\n\nThe *Heshang Gong Commentary* does not appear in the *Han Records*.

      "translated_text": "The division into eighty-one chapters aligns broadly yet differs in minor details from the seventy-two chapters of Yan Junping’s *Dao and Virtue Pointing to the Return*, and the seventy-nine chapters of Wang Bi’s original edition. Gu Shenzi took the final seventeen characters of the chapter \"To Bend Is to Become Whole\" and made them the beginning of the next chapter, while Tang Junxiang appended \"To Cease Learning Brings No Sorrow\" to the end of the preceding chapter. By the Yuan dynasty, Wu Cheng had already rearranged the text according to his own judgment, and in recent times, Yao Nai has done likewise—though Yao’s version is the most errant of all. Sima Qian merely stated that the book comprised over five thousand characters, yet some reckless scholars have arbitrarily excised words to meet this count. Fu Yi’s definitive edition, meanwhile, contains many superfluous additions. Wang Bi noted that the chapter \"Fine Weapons Are Inauspicious\" includes later interpolations, while Fu Yi claimed that the four lines beginning \"Ever excelling in saving people\" appear only in the *Heshang Gong* version. The *Hanfeizi* is the earliest source, yet its quotations are often inferior to those in the *Huainanzi*. The *Kaiyuan Imperial Commentary* even appends redundant glosses to \"Feeding on the Mother,\" among other instances of dilution and distortion—how can one enumerate them all? Still more absurd are the wild tales from the western deserts and the fantastical legends of Yan and Qi. One must discern what is authentic, discard what is false, trace the original text, and resolve its divergences—thus may one humbly align with those who transmit and cherish antiquity.\n\nFrom the *Records of the Historian: Biographies of Laozi*:\nLaozi was a native of Quren Village, Lixiang, Ku County in Chu. {*Zhuangzi* records that Confucius and Yang Zhu traveled south to Pei to visit Laozi. The stele inscription by Bian Shao states that Laozi was from Xiang County in Chu. The *Shiwen* commentary on *Zhuangzi* cites a note identifying Laozi as a native of Xiang in Chen; today, this area belongs to Ku County, near Pei. The *Shui Jing Zhu*’s \"Yin Bu\" chapter notes: \"Flowing southeast to Pei, it becomes the Gui River. The Gui River then flows east past the old city of Ku County to the south—this was the Xiang of the Spring and Autumn period. Wang Mang renamed it Lailing. It continues east past the old city of Lai Village to the south, then north past the eastern side of the Laozi Temple, before bending east past the old city of Xiang County to the south. Xiang County is now a wasteland, incorporated into the old city of Ku County. It is said that Laozi was born between Qu and Gui.\" This account is particularly detailed. Lai and Li are phonetic transpositions; the area between Qu and Gui is Quren Village.} His given name was Er, his courtesy name Dan, and his surname Li. {Yao Nai notes: \"This follows the original text of the *Records of the Historian* as cited in the commentary to the *Later Han Annals* under the reign of Emperor Huan. Popular editions give his courtesy name as Boyang and posthumous title as Dan, likely due to flatterers during the Kaiyuan era of the Tang who, claiming descent from Laozi, moved the *Biography of Laozi* to the beginning of the *Records* and altered the historical text accordingly. The *Shiwen* commentary on *Zhuangzi* cites the *Records* as giving his courtesy name as Dan, while *Heshang Gong* gives it as Boyang. Zhang Shoujie’s *Zhengyi* commentary states: 'Dan means ears without rims.' It speculates that Laozi’s ears lacked rims, hence his name Er and courtesy name Dan.\" This shows that early Tang editions had not yet been altered. When Confucius listed the virtuous officials he revered, he referred to them by surname and courtesy name—Yan Pingzhong, Qu Boyu, Lao Dan, and Zichan—consistent with the naming conventions for eminent men. Commoners did not receive posthumous titles, and \"Dan\" does not conform to posthumous naming conventions; its spuriousness is beyond doubt. *Zhuangzi* records Laozi residing in Pei, which was Song territory, and the state of Song had a Lao clan. Thus, Laozi may have been a descendant of the Zi clan of Pei, with \"Zi\" evolving into \"Li\"—much like \"Si\" becoming \"Yi.\" Pengcheng lies near Pei, and it is likely that Dan often resided there, hence the appellation \"Old Peng.\" This is akin to Zhan Qin being called \"Liu Xia.\" Thus, Xing Bing’s commentary stating that \"Old Peng\" refers to Laozi is not without basis.} He served as the Keeper of the Archives in Zhou.",

      "translated_text": "Confucius journeyed to Zhou to inquire about ritual from Laozi. Laozi said: \"The men of whom you speak—both they and their bones have long since decayed. Only their words remain. Moreover, when the noble man encounters his time, he mounts his carriage; when he does not, he drifts like tumbleweed. I have heard that the skilled merchant conceals his wealth as if empty, and the noble man of abundant virtue appears simple in countenance. Rid yourself of your prideful qi and excessive desires, your affected manner and extravagant ambitions. These are all of no benefit to your person. What I have to tell you is only this.\"\n\nConfucius departed and said to his disciples: \"Of birds, I know their ability to fly; of fish, their ability to swim; of beasts, their ability to run. Those that run may be caught in nets, those that swim in lines, those that fly in arrows. But as for the dragon—I cannot know how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend the heavens. Today, I have seen Laozi—is he not like the dragon?\"\n\n{Zhu Xi said: \"Some claim that Old Peng is Laozi. I once suspected this as well. But considering the passages on ritual in *Zengzi’s Questions*, where it speaks of 'transmitting but not creating' and 'trusting and delighting in antiquity,' we can see that Dan was the Keeper of the Archives in Zhou, custodian of the state’s classical texts. The writings of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors—such as the five thousand characters—may have been ancient sayings that Laozi transmitted. *Liezi* cites the *Book of the Yellow Emperor*, which is the chapter 'The Valley Spirit Never Dies.' Chen Hong said: 'When Confucius inquired about ritual from Lao Dan, he must have subtly conveyed an intention to admonish. Laozi perceived this, hence his words about ridding oneself of prideful qi and the like. Otherwise, Confucius was humbly seeking instruction—how could he have been prideful?'\"}\n\nLaozi cultivated the Dao and virtue, taking concealment and namelessness as his duty. He resided in Zhou for many years, but seeing its decline, he departed for the pass. The Keeper of the Pass, Yin Xi, said: \"You are about to withdraw from the world—compel yourself to write a book for me.\" Thereupon, Laozi composed a work in two scrolls, expounding the meaning of the Dao and virtue in over five thousand characters, then departed. No one knew where he went.\n\n{The *Book of Han*’s *Biography of Yang Xiong* states that Lao Dan wrote two scrolls on emptiness and nothingness, which are the \"upper and lower scrolls\" referred to in the *Records of the Historian*.

      "translated_text": "The *Imperial Commentary* of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang further divided the text into the *Classic of the Dao* and the *Classic of Virtue*, while the *Eighty-One Chapters Commentary* by Heshang Gong additionally assigned titles to each chapter—all later fabrications without ancient basis. Thus, the present edition restores the original division into merely an upper and lower scroll, with chapters numbered sequentially. As for textual variants, the *Explanations of Terms* already notes that the original *Laozi* circulated in many divergent versions. Du Guangting observed that later hands may have excised particles and function words to conform to the five-thousand-character count. Such matters demand careful scrutiny.\n\nSome say: Old Master Lai was also a native of Chu. He composed fifteen scrolls expounding the application of the Daoist teachings and was a contemporary of Confucius. Laozi lived to be over one hundred and sixty years old—or, some say, over two hundred—owing to his cultivation of the Dao and nurturing of longevity.\n\n{The *Han shu*’s *Treatise on Arts and Letters* lists *Old Master Lai* in sixteen scrolls under the Daoist school. The *Biographies of Eminent Recluses* records that Old Master Lai declined an appointment from the King of Chu. The *Biographies of Exemplary Women* states that in his seventieth year, Old Master Lai behaved like an infant to delight his parents. Yet *Zhuangzi* relates that Old Master Lai, while gathering firewood, encountered Confucius and said: \"Cast off your bodily pride and your ostentatious wisdom—this is the mark of a noble man.\" The *Strategies of the Warring States* also quotes a retainer of Qi Huang as saying: \"Have you not heard of Old Master Lai’s instruction to Confucius on serving a lord? He showed him the durability of teeth and how, by sixty, all teeth are worn away.\" These accounts of Laozi’s words and deeds are thoroughly confused. The *Records of the Historian*’s *Biographies of Confucius’s Disciples* states: \"Those whom Confucius revered: in Zhou, Laozi; in Chu, Old Master Lai.\" Thus, they are clearly two distinct persons, both contemporaries of Confucius. The *Zuozhuan* mentions Lai Ju—Lai being his clan name, and \"Old\" a prefix, just as Lie Yukou’s teacher was called Old Master Shang.

Know the white, yet guard the black, becoming the world’s model. Others all seek precedence; I alone take the rear, saying, ‘I bear the world’s filth.’ Others all seek fullness; I alone seek emptiness. Without hoarding, I thus have abundance. Unshaken, I thus abound. In conducting myself, I am unhurried and expend nothing. Through non-action, I mock skill.

      "translated_text": "The perfected person harbors truth in obscurity, yet never speaks of it to others—not out of secrecy, but because the Dao fundamentally cannot be revealed through words or sought in names and traces. Yet when pressed by Guan Yin’s entreaties, Laozi was compelled to write, and thus solemnly declared at the outset: the Dao is most difficult to express. If it could be grasped through analogy or named definitively, it would possess a fixed meaning—and no longer be the ever-present, unchanging truth. To cling to what is not the unchanging truth as the Dao is to speak of benevolence yet harm benevolence, to exalt righteousness yet harm righteousness, to uphold ritual yet harm ritual. From this arise the habits of petty deceit and pretense, and what is called the Dao becomes corrupted—how then could it endure? When Laozi speaks of the Dao, he invariably calls it \"constant\" and \"profound.\" For the Dao is simply nothingness, and \"true constancy\" points to the reality of this nothingness, while \"primordial subtlety\" praises the constancy of this nothingness.\n\nLaozi saw that learning had grown increasingly divergent, mired in being and drowned in traces. He sought to remedy this with the unchanging, incorruptible Dao, and thus began by warning people against grasping words, doctrines, names, and traces as the Dao. Fearing they would lack discernment, he used the principles of heaven, earth, and the myriad things to guide them. Yet still concerned this might not feel intimate enough, he further turned to the moments of human desire and desirelessness, urging introspection. Only then, lest they divide being and nothingness in two, did he unite them under the term \"profound,\" merging their subtleties into the gateway of all mysteries.\n\nAll passages in the text describing the essence of the Dao arise from observing its subtlety; all discussions of its application in affairs arise from observing its manifestations. Only when the mind merges with the spirit and becomes one with the Dao—attaining the profundity beyond profundity—does every manifestation among the myriad things become a manifestation of the myriad subtleties. All teachings on guarding the feminine, on non-contention, on compassion and frugality, on softness and weakness—these countless subtleties all emerge from this constant nothingness. Thus it is called the \"gateway to all mysteries.\" What can be spoken and named is fully contained within the five thousand characters; what cannot be transmitted through words lies in the personal realization of those who embody the Dao. The entire book’s essential meaning is encapsulated here—what is called \"words having a source, affairs having a ruler.\"\n\nMaster Wu Cheng said: The first chapter presents the forms of the two characters *Dao* and *virtue*. The nameless is the Dao; the named is virtue. Laozi’s intent was to regard emptiness and nothingness as that by which heaven and earth become heaven and earth—what Zhuangzi called \"establishing them in constant nothingness and being.\" He saw qi-transformation as that by which the myriad things attain their nature—what Zhuangzi called \"governing them with the Great Unity.\" Thus, his Dao and virtue take emptiness, nothingness, and spontaneity as their essence, and softness, weakness, and non-fullness as their function. The subtlety of observing subtlety is the Dao; the one root of subtlety. The subtleties among the myriad subtleties are virtue; the scattered manifestations of subtlety.\n\nJiao Hong said: *Desire* here is like the *Record of Music*’s \"moved by things and stirred by desire.\" *Manifestation* is read like the *frontier* in \"border frontier,\" referring to the furthest extent of things. Yanzi said, \"The frontier is where virtue returns\"; Liezi said, \"Death is the frontier of virtue\"—both refer to the point of exhaustion. For nothingness in the absence of desire requires no explanation. Only when desire arises do people invariably point to it as being. Yet desire must reach its limit and return to nothingness—how then does this differ from subtlety? Thus it is said, \"These two emerge together yet bear different names.\" This was said out of necessity for those who have not yet awakened. Hence: \"Profound beyond profundity—the gateway to all mysteries.\"\n\nSu Zhe said: Whatever is distant and without limit appears dark and obscure in color. Thus Laozi often used \"profound\" to signify the ultimate.",

Yet when they accord with their time and suit their circumstances, all under heaven call them beauty and goodness.

The sage knows that what has a name cannot endure, and thus throughout the day he acts yet has never acted, speaks yet has never spoken. How could he himself know what is beauty or goodness? This is to perceive the subtleties and attain the mystery. In this way, though the myriad things come and he responds accordingly, he gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, and ultimately does not dwell in their names. For the beauty and goodness of what has a name invariably rise and fall with their opposites, since to dwell is to depart. If within oneself there is no dwelling, then where could there be departure?

      "translated_text": "Here is the translation:\n\n---\n\nThis is a scripture for saving the world, and thus its first two chapters set forth its fundamental purpose. Here it proceeds to employ the governance of the great antiquity to correct the ills of the degenerate age. Now, the world falls into disorder because of *you-wei* (purposeful action) that disturbs it. *You-wei* arises from desire, and desire arises from knowledge. Daily, one awakens boundless knowledge, only then to restrain boundless desire—this is like the flooding of the Yangtze and Yellow River, only to later block them with a single reed. The Most High never claimed to possess knowledge, nor did he perceive anything as desirable. Thus, his governance of the world was likewise. What is called \"the worthy\" refers specifically to those of exceptional talent and eccentric conduct. For the noble person loves fame, and the petty person loves profit; both worthiness and wealth are instruments of desire. Therefore, when people esteem one another for worthiness, the people feel shame at being inferior and thus come to contend. When goods are valued for their rarity, the people suffer from their absence and thus come to steal. All this stems from perceiving what is desirable.\n\nIn a well-governed age, people esteem purity and simplicity. There is no need to surpass others through worthiness or knowledge. Things are taken to nourish people, and there is no value in rarity or uselessness. Thus, the worthy and the unworthy are employed alike, and the rare and the common are regarded equally. The people do not perceive these distinctions to disturb their hearts, and so the roots of contention and theft are severed.\n\nNow, the people’s hearts are not empty because they have things to esteem, value, and desire. Their ambitions are not weak because they harbor the seeds of contention, theft, and rebellion. But now, with no external longings, their hearts are empty. Though their bellies are full, they content themselves with chewing and drumming their bellies, their eyes no longer distracting their minds. With no resentment or rivalry, their ambitions are weak. Though their bones are strong, their essence is sufficient and their sinews whole, they have no outlet for exerting their strength.\n\nFor the Dao takes emptiness as its essence and weakness as its function; there is no need for fullness or strength. Thus, only the belly may be filled, and only the bones may be strengthened. By taking emptiness and weakness as the nature of heart and ambition, and relegating strength and fullness to places of no use, their hearts and ambitions remain ever without knowledge and without desire. Without knowledge and without desire, there is non-action. Even if those with keen intelligence and extensive learning emerge, desiring to act, they dare not do so. Through the practice of non-action, the people return to simplicity without realizing it. How could there be anything not well-governed?\n\nMaster Zhang Erqi said: The four—heart, belly, ambition, and bones—are all metaphors. The sage’s governance, in matters of florid embellishment, strives to empty them; in matters of plain substance, strives to fill them; in matters of contention, strives to block them; and in matters of self-cultivation, strives to exalt them. It causes the people to be without knowledge and thus not to generate discriminating views, and to be without desire and thus not to arouse covetous hearts. His explanation also accords. As for later generations of *yangsheng* (nurturing life) practitioners who borrow these four as their doctrine, they have gone astray.\n\n---",

The essence of the Dao is ultimately so, yet in its use, how could it ever be full? Profoundly deep, it gives rise to all things without being objectified by them—thus it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. Now, the reason people’s use of it often errs by becoming full is that they rely on their own sharpness to entangle others, or use their own brilliance to illuminate others’ dust. Blunting one’s sharpness, entanglements dissolve of themselves; harmonizing one’s radiance, dust merges of itself. This is how its use remains never full. Profound, it seems to endure—thus its essence remains empty.

      "translated_text": "The dust, though utterly mixed, finds no difference in anything—thus it differs not from the myriad things. Only when the sage’s Dao is like this does it remain whole, then abiding in stillness, ever present. Though present, none recognize it, so it seems but as if present.\n\n*(Yuan’s note on the last two lines: These speak of one who embodies the Dao, plain and intimate. Many scholars take them as speculative extremes. Yet to ask \"whose child is the Dao?\" is too fragmented, and to push the Dao to a place before the Lord of Manifestation is too illusory—thus I reject both.)*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Four**\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent—\nthey treat the myriad things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not benevolent—\nhe treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nis it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet never exhausted,\nthe more it moves, the more it yields.\n\nWords multiply and lead to exhaustion—\nbetter to hold to the center.\n\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female\nis called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nSubtly, it seems to endure—\nits use is never strained.\n\n*(This expresses Laozi’s lament that his Dao goes unheeded, his sorrow that the world’s chaos cannot be saved, and his longing to withdraw, preserving his own integrity. The sage rebukes the rulers of his age—those who claim sagely wisdom for themselves—who bind straw into dogs for sacrifice, then discard and trample them once the rites are done. Seeing the lives of the people in a disordered age as fleeting as straw, Laozi exclaims: \"Alas! Do Heaven and Earth at times lack benevolence, viewing the myriad things as worthless, leaving their life and death to fate? Does the sage not value benevolence, treating the people as mere grass, without care or pity?\" He shifts blame to Heaven and Earth, exalts it as the sage’s doing—yet this is but the language of one who pities Heaven and grieves for humanity, with nowhere to direct his reproach. But if he would shift blame to Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth cannot be blamed. For Heaven and Earth, without intent, bring forth transformation—like a bellows, empty within, where qi moves and yields endlessly. This is what is meant by \"manifesting through benevolence, concealing through function,\" stirring the myriad things without sharing the sage’s cares. Thus the sage rightfully bears concern. Heaven and Earth, without intent, bring forth transformation; the sage, with intent, practices non-action. The responsibility for the hundred clans and myriad things lies with the sage—it is not Heaven and Earth who treat them as straw dogs, but people who do so. At this point, Laozi no longer wishes to speak at length. Yet if we live between Heaven and Earth, unable to ensure each being fulfills its nature, shall we too abandon our own nature, leaving ourselves to be treated as straw dogs by Heaven and humanity? Looking inward to the self, the body is a small Heaven and Earth. Turning within, silently recognizing the center and guarding it—why then clamor with many words, entangling oneself deeply in worldly affairs and inviting the exhaustion of principle and fate?

      "translated_text": "The use of the useless—this is how one responds to things. If one can truly embody and guard this, in small matters it becomes the art of nurturing life and concentrating qi; in great matters, it is the Dao of emptiness, numinosity, and harmonious response. How could there be any exhaustion? For emptiness responds to conditions—when applied to the world, it becomes the sage’s governance through non-action. If it cannot be applied, mere words are of no benefit and only invite harm. Better to refine the Dao and apply it, returning to the subtly wondrous and undifferentiated within the self. Then one’s personal realm has already attained the age of the primordial sovereigns. This is the teaching of the Supreme without words.\n\nThe bellows without and the key within—when the mechanism is activated, it becomes an instrument for drawing wind. \"Exhausted\" means depleted. At first, Heaven, Earth, and the sage are spoken of together, but afterward only Heaven and Earth are mentioned, omitting the sage—this is precisely Laozi’s reason for not wishing to speak at length. \"Exhaustion of fate\" (*shu qiong*): the *Shiwen* glosses this as the exhaustion of principle and the momentum of fate. \"The center\" is the empty center, referring to the heart-mind. The metaphors of valley, female, and the back’s center—\"valley spirit\" (*gu shen*) illustrates its virtue, while \"mysterious female\" (*xuan pin*) illustrates its function. The valley’s relation to echo: only because it receives all things without exception does it ceaselessly respond. This is how its spirit abides within the center and never dies. Among all things under Heaven, only the female can receive and give birth. As for receiving without revealing how it receives, or generating without revealing how it generates—this is the most profoundly unfathomable female. It can mother the myriad things, and all things emerge from this gate. Is this not the root of Heaven and Earth? It is precisely what the first chapter calls \"the nameless, the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the named, the mother of the myriad things.\" This is the constant Dao.\n\n\"Subtly continuous, as if existing\"—this is the subtlety of observing the wondrous. \"Used without exhaustion\"—this is the subtlety of observing the minute. Wu Cheng said: When the valley is empty, the spirit abides within. \"As if existing\" is the spirit’s abiding. \"Exhaustion\" means labor.

Only when one possesses this virtue and yet does not contend, like water’s source dwelling above yet willingly abiding below, is it the highest virtue. The multitude abhors dwelling below and thus must prefer dwelling above; those who desire to surpass others harbor contentious hearts.

Both emerge from non-being into being, not far removed from the Dao, and thus may be named \"virtue.\" Nothing surpasses this. The Dao is present everywhere; water benefits everything. Avoiding the high and tending toward the low, it never resists—this is \"good at abiding in the earth.\" Empty and profoundly still, its depths unfathomable—this is \"good at profound stillness.\" Drawn from yet inexhaustible, bestowing without seeking repayment—this is \"good at kindness.\" Round, it must revolve; square, it must break; obstructed, it must halt; released, it must flow—this is \"good at trustworthiness.\" Washing away all filth, leveling high and low—this is \"good at order.\" To bear is to float; to reflect is to clarify; to strike is to overcome all hardness—this is \"good at capability.\" Unceasing day and night, filling depressions before advancing—this is \"good at timeliness.\" Those who possess flaws yet escape human reproach do so because they contend. Water alone embodies these seven virtues without contention, and thus remains without blame.\n\nEditor’s note: The explanations from \"dwelling in good earth\" onward may apply to water or to humans, all being coherent.

      "translated_text": "To tend the po-soul is to tend the hun-soul and po-soul. The po-soul is the One. To \"carry\" is to embrace. The hun-soul carries the po-soul—movement guarding stillness. The essence and clarity of the heart are called hun-soul and po-soul, which are not two things in origin. Yet the hun-soul moves while the po-soul remains still. If the heart is enslaved by things, they separate into two, and spirit no longer abides in its dwelling, while blood and qi take control. Only by embracing them as one, allowing form and spirit to depend on each other, so that movement and stillness are not lost, do hun-soul and po-soul become one—po-soul as hun-soul, hun-soul as po-soul. What dissipation? What dullness? Thus may they endure long. For it is not the difficulty of occasionally carrying them, nor the difficulty of embracing the One, but the difficulty of never parting from them.

To concentrate is to be single-minded, pure, and steadfast, without any outward dispersion—this is what is called the guarding of pure qi. If there is the slightest loss to coarseness, it becomes rigid and cannot be soft. It must be like an infant, with harmonious qi inwardly full, unified and unadulterated, before it can be utmost softness. The perfected person is not externally hindered by the po-soul nor internally driven by qi—his self-governance may be called excellent. Yet he still fears the lingering presence of flaws. The flaws of the untrained are coarse and easy to correct; the flaws of the trained are subtle and difficult to remove. Some, in their guarding, become stagnant and fail in application; others, in their adherence, remain untransformed and cling to the self-view. These are all sufficient to cause illness and fall short of the profound. One must add the work of cleansing and removing blemishes, further employing the mirror of inward reflection.

      "translated_text": "Laozi’s instructions to people may be called incisive. Yet the wise eliminate the mind but not affairs, while the benighted eliminate affairs but not the mind. Should one misconstrue his earlier words, how few would avoid taking the \"bent axle\" as their path of study! Thus he further clarifies: \"What I speak of as 'bearing and nourishing the po-soul' does not mean clasping silence—it means loving the people and governing the state while practicing non-action. This is what is called 'acting through non-action.' 'Concentrating qi to attain softness' does not mean stifling closure—it means that the Gate of Heaven opens and shuts while one abides in femininity. This is what is called 'the male guarding the female.' 'Cleansing and contemplating the mysterious mirror' does not mean obscuring darkness—it means being enlightened in all four directions while maintaining non-knowing. This is what is called 'knowing the unknowing.'\n\nNow, loving the people and governing the state, the Gate of Heaven opening and shutting, being enlightened in all four directions—when it comes to nurturing life, these are all acts of fostering and leading, none of which are abandoned. Yet through non-action, abiding in femininity, and non-knowing, life is not possessed, action is not relied upon, and leadership is not domineering. What is this if not profound virtue? This is what Guan Yinzi meant by 'having no abode within oneself, yet the forms of things manifest naturally,' and what Zhuangzi meant by 'taking emptiness and the indestructibility of the myriad things as the real.'\n\nHow could this mean abandoning the reality of human affairs to rely solely on emptiness and nothingness? Su Zhe said: \"The sage, having cultivated the Dao within himself, extends its surplus to govern others. Yet he encounters all with a mindless heart. If he were to act with intention, then loving the people would only harm them, and governing the state would only bring disorder. Yang moves and yin is still; one opens and one shuts—from this arise order and chaos, rise and fall. The multitude, facing such moments, are anxious over gain and loss, always seeking fortune before the fact. The sage follows principle and understands the Mandate of Heaven, responding only after being prompted—this is what is called 'preceding Heaven yet Heaven does not oppose, following Heaven yet conforming to its seasons.' It means that his timing, whether early or late, perfectly accords with the Mandate of Heaven. Thus, one who can abide in femininity does not miss the moment.\"\n\nLi Zhi said: \"Embracing the mysterious and guarding the One, the spirit does not stray outward. With a master within, the Gate of Heaven’s opening and shutting remain ever in one’s control. As for those in the world who cannot master themselves: when there is opening, they rush forth without being pressed; when there is shutting, they resist without being at ease. This is inner dissipation—how can they embrace the One without parting from it?\"\n\nZhang Erqi said: \"The 'primal contemplation' is the observation of the wondrous and the subtle. The 'opening and shutting of the Gate of Heaven' refers to the movement and transformation of the mind.\" Zhu Xi said: \"The learning of Laozi takes emptiness, stillness, non-action, and humble self-restraint as its essence.

Therefore, the sage rejects *that*—the pursuit of what is seen and desired—and embraces *this*—the emptiness and stillness of what is without knowledge or desire. This resembles the *Yi Jing*’s ‘stopping at the back’ and the *Yin Fu Jing*’s principle that the mechanism lies in the eyes.\"\n\nYe Sijing said: \"All external objects of desire harm the body. The sage attends only to filling the belly to nourish the self, not to pleasing the eyes by yielding to things. Yet flavors, sounds, and colors—these cannot be entirely severed. Only by acting without attachment to things can one abide in profound desirelessness. All defilement and pursuit of sensory realms begin with the eyes—hence the text addresses this from start to finish. This is why Yanzi’s *Four Abstentions* begin with sight, and the severing of the six senses places eye and form first. The previous chapter spoke of the function of emptiness within; this one warns against being filled by external perversions.\"",

      "translated_text": "Glory—this is honor. Honor—this is weight. The people of the world do not recognize disgrace as disgrace and so prize it; they do not recognize trouble as trouble and so value it. Thus, they glorify their own disgrace and honor their own trouble. Like alarm—this vividly describes how they prize it. Like the body—this vividly describes how they value it. Now, no one fails to detest disgrace or fear trouble, yet they reverse course and call it honor and value—how can this be? It is because the world’s people grow accustomed to delusion, failing to return to their root; they grow complacent in their present circumstances, never observing their end.\n\nWhat does it mean for people to honor their disgrace? Precisely that what can be disgraced is what they call honor. For one who honors others is above them, while one who is honored by others is beneath them. To be beneath others—what is this if not disgrace? Yet the world reverses this and glorifies it. Gaining it, they are alarmed with joy; losing it, they are alarmed with sorrow. Is this not honoring disgrace alone?\n\nThe honor in \"honor and disgrace\" refers to oneself; the honor in \"being honored as beneath\" refers to others. What does it mean for people to value their trouble as they do their body? Precisely that what can trouble them is what they deem indispensable. People are self-serving by nature: with desire comes trouble. If one could transcend the body and detach from it, what trouble would there be in gain or loss? Thus, all the desires one cultivates for the body—what are these if not great trouble? Yet people cling to them as if they were born with them and refuse to relinquish them even briefly. Is this not valuing great trouble as one does the body? This is all because they do not understand the Dao of self-respect and self-care.\n\nRelying on others’ honor to feel weighty only leads to self-diminishment. If one could truly respect oneself, even if the world glorified them, they would not lightly place their body in such a position. Pursuing external gains to indulge oneself only leads to self-suffering. If one could truly care for oneself, even if entrusted with the world, they would cherish their body and not take it on lightly. In this way, it is as if one lodges the body between Heaven and Earth—possessing the world yet not clinging to it, as if merely a temporary guest.\n\nThe *Huainanzi* cites Laozi’s words here, illustrating them with the example of King Tai fleeing Bin, staff in hand, to settle beneath Mount Qi. Indeed, one who cannot be honored—what disgrace is there? One who values nothing beyond the body—what trouble do they bring upon themselves?\n\nThe interpretations of this chapter vary widely. Most take \"alarmed by honor\" as natural, \"forgetting the body\" as an illusion, and \"entrusting and relying\" as a weighty responsibility. Here, I reject all such readings and select only those that align more closely.\n\nWu Cheng says: What people regard as glory, from the perspective of one who understands the Dao, is disgrace—what is there to love? Yet those who love it are alarmed by it. What people regard as great profit, from the perspective of one who understands the Dao, is great trouble—how can it be valued? Yet those who value it cling to it as if it were their body. Thus, being honored is ultimately base, yet gain and loss disturb the heart; things outside the body are ultimately trivial, yet they are treated as if inseparable from it—such delusion is extreme.\n\nLü Huiqing says: Honor is what one is kept by others—it is the lower Dao. To be honored and possess that honor is to invite disgrace. The reason I have disgrace is because I have alarm: alarmed by gain, then alarmed by loss. If I had no alarm, what disgrace would I have? The reason I have great trouble is because I have a body. Thus, fortune is my trouble, and misfortune is my trouble. If I had no body, what trouble would I have?",

Wang Bi includes *return* after *each*. The *Zhuangzi* reads, \"The myriad things in profusion, each returning to its root.\"}\n\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nstillness is called returning to one’s mandate.\nReturning to one’s mandate is called constancy.\nTo know constancy is called illumination.\nNot knowing constancy—\nreckless action brings misfortune.\nKnowing constancy brings capacity;\ncapacity brings impartiality;\nimpartiality brings kingship;\nkingship brings heaven.\n{The stele version reads: *Impartiality can give life; life can reach heaven.*}\nHeaven brings the Dao;\nthe Dao brings enduringness.\nTo the end of one’s days, one will not be imperiled.\n\n{This thoroughly expounds the essence of embodying constancy, and its entry lies in observing return. Observing return is observing the subtle. The five lines from *Now, things flourish* above demonstrate the natural principle of things, advancing the notion that movement invariably returns to stillness. From *To know constancy is called illumination* below, it speaks of the clarity of the Daoist who observes return, and the efficacy of reaching emptiness and guarding stillness. *To reach* means to attain its utmost. *Emptiness* means desirelessness. Without desire, there is stillness—when external things do not enter, the inner heart does not emerge. *Unwavering* means steadfast. In cultivating the Dao, to reach emptiness is to attain its utmost, and thus one’s guarding of stillness becomes steadfast. Hence, the following text focuses solely on the utmost stillness.\n\nTo reach emptiness without knowing that the actual is emptiness, or to guard stillness without knowing that movement is stillness, is to observe nothingness in nothingness without observing nothingness in being. All being arises from emptiness, and all movement arises from stillness. Thus, though the myriad things arise together, they ultimately return to emptiness and stillness—this is the utmost steadfastness of things. Yet ordinary people only see return after things cease, or see their return to the root after they decline. Only those who know the Dao, having reached the utmost emptiness and stillness, perceive the arising of things and their flourishing in abundance. What causes them to arise is what causes them to return. Knowing that all arising is illusory and that stillness is constant, they grasp the mandate of nature to govern all phenomena—constantly having and constantly lacking, constantly acting and constantly still. This is called knowing the subtleties. How could there be misfortune from reckless action?\n\nSuch knowledge is not mere hearing, seeing, or conjecture. It is the ability to merge with the unity of self and things, to be all-embracing externally and free from private bias internally—this is nearly true knowledge. Thus, in its greatness, it is inner sageliness and outer kingship; in its transformation, it unites with heaven and exhausts the Dao. To exhaust the Dao is nothing other than constancy. To endure without peril is to abide in constancy.\n\n○ Su Shi’s younger brother Zhe said: If one does not reach the utmost emptiness, something remains unvanished. If one does not guard stillness with unwavering depth, movement remains unvanished. Though mountains and hills may be removed, the finest dust is not yet gone—this is not the utmost or the unwavering. Without reaching the utmost or guarding with depth, it is difficult to expect the efficacy of emptiness and stillness. Only by reaching the utmost emptiness and unwavering stillness can one observe the changes of the myriad things without being disturbed by them, knowing that all arising must return. If I, too, were to arise with the myriad things, I would be unable to know this. The myriad things arise from nature and return to nature, like blossoms and leaves that grow from the root and return to the root. Nature and mandate are the root of the myriad things. If one cannot return to one’s own nature, even ceasing movement and stilling thoughts to seek stillness is not true stillness. Only by returning to the root and recovering one’s mandate can one abide in profound constancy.\n\nNot taking the recovery of nature as illumination is merely worldly wisdom. Though one may call it illumination, it is not true illumination. Thus, moving with things, there is no action that is not reckless. Though one may gain something temporarily, the loss is far greater. When deluded by recklessness, one takes the self as right and others as wrong, treating all things as enemies. But if one knows that all is illusory, even enemies will be pitied and cherished—what could not be embraced? Then the feelings of self and other are exhausted, and whom would one favor? Without partiality, all becomes impartial. Impartiality leads to kingship, and kingship leads to heaven.}",

Thus, the common people merely knew of their existence. When virtue later declined, governance relied on benevolence and righteousness. The world, enveloped in their benevolence, grew attached to them; cherishing their righteousness, they praised them. When benevolence and righteousness proved insufficient to govern, penal laws were employed, and the people came to fear them. When penal laws failed to subdue their will, cunning and deceit became the norm, and the people scorned them. All this arose from the gradual erosion of sincerity and trust, leading to increasing disbelief. If, however, those above practiced the teaching of non-action and achieved success, the people would each follow their nature, all saying, \"I am naturally thus.\" Then the sentiments of attachment, praise, fear, and scorn would not arise in the world.}\n\nWu Cheng states: As in the saying, \"How precious is speech!\" The people unknowingly receive its blessings, all claiming, \"I am naturally thus,\" unaware of the ruler’s influence. This exemplifies the supreme state of \"not even knowing of its existence.\" That which is \"not even known\" is the Great Dao. Those who are attached and praise it rely on benevolence and righteousness. Those who fear it rely on wisdom. Those who scorn it engage in great falsity. From the Great Dao’s initial decline and further descent, these several stages emerge. Yet when the Great Dao declines and benevolence and righteousness arise, the transformation is still gradual. But when wisdom emerges and great falsity swiftly follows, the change is precipitous. The lines on the six relations lacking harmony likewise illustrate the consequences of the Great Dao’s decline and the rise of benevolence and righteousness.\n\nThe foregoing describes the descent of worldly change, revealing the origins of deviation from the root. What follows expounds the restoration of governance, guiding the gradual return to the source. \"Sageliness and wisdom\" refer to wisdom. \"Artifice and profit\" refer to great falsity. Abandoning the emperor’s benevolence and righteousness to return to the sovereign’s Great Dao restores the people to their original state—fathers kind, children filial—like the pure antiquity of old. Abandoning the king’s sageliness and wisdom to revert to the emperor’s benevolence and righteousness multiplies the people’s benefits a hundredfold compared to the king’s era. Abandoning the overlord’s artifice and profit to return to the king’s sageliness and wisdom—though not yet reaching the emperor’s time—ensures deep and far-reaching thought, well-ordered governance, and enlightened instruction, so that none will become thieves or bandits.",

The Great Dao of the Sovereign possesses true abundance, while cultural refinement is insufficient. From the Sovereign’s era downward, there has been a gradual shift toward refinement, so each successive age regards the preceding culture as inadequate and attaches itself to what it esteems. Thus, through repeated changes, it drifts toward the superficial, unaware that the people of the Great Dao appear plain and embrace simplicity—nothing more than unadorned substance. In this state, they harbor few selfish desires; what need have they for refinement?\n\nAbove, it was said that when the six relations are discordant, there arises the practice of filial piety and kindness, yet here it speaks of the people reverting to filial piety and kindness. This is because when people are truly filial and kind, these virtues bear no name—such is the distinction between name and reality, culture and substance. Extending this principle, true benevolence and righteousness leave no trace of benevolence and righteousness, and true sageliness and wisdom bear no name of sageliness and wisdom—it is no different.

When counterfeit prevails, there is a reversion to honoring the Dao. This descent marks the Dao’s subtlety; this reversion marks the extremity of decline.\n\nWhen the Dao has not yet dispersed, benevolence and righteousness lie hidden within it, undivided and unenumerated. But when it becomes warm and solicitous in isolated fragments, people cling to that warmth and solicitude as virtue—then the impartiality of the great Dao scatters. Moreover, if there are those of petty wisdom and shallow cleverness who usurp the semblance of benevolence and righteousness to act upon it, counterfeit flourishes from this, and disorder begins from this. This is what is meant by “descending and giving rise to falsity.”\n\nAs this reaches its latter flow, human counterfeits multiply, and none are without fault. Among the throng of faults, one who slightly distinguishes himself is then esteemed. Thus, only when the six relations are disharmonious does one recognize filial piety and kindness; only when the state is benighted and chaotic does one recognize loyal ministers. This is what is meant by “reverting and honoring the Dao.”\n\nWhen the Dao first disperses, people see its semblance and forget its wholeness. When it declines, nothing remains, yet they esteem its semblance. This is why things grow ever worse with each passing state.\n\nThus, Laozi teaches to sever the source of profit and unify it, returning to the root to rescue the branch—this is the essential point. For the benevolent do not regard themselves as benevolent; the righteous do not regard themselves as righteous. If benevolence and righteousness could be severed, they would not be true benevolence and righteousness. Great skill does not display its skill; exquisite profit does not speak of its profit. If cunning and profit could be severed, they would not be true cunning and profit.\n\nThe sage employs substance and does not take form; he teaches that what appears externally should have no shape. The multitude steals semblances to disrupt the real, so what appears externally becomes attached to something. The sage detests counterfeit for its power to disrupt the real, thus he seeks to sever its root source to remedy the ills of the latter flow. He would have the people of the world no longer borrow benevolence and righteousness while abandoning the substance of filial piety and kindness, harbor profit-seeking minds while usurping the conduct of sageliness and wisdom, employ thieves and bandits while forsaking the convenience of cunning and profit.\n\nHe leads only with simplicity and plainness, never displaying private desires to the people.

As for the line \"Abandon learning, and there is no sorrow\" and what follows down to Zhang Junxiang’s commentary in the Tang, appended to the end of this chapter by Yao Nai—both the meaning and prosody are discordant, and thus not followed.\n\n---\n\nAbandon learning, and there is no sorrow.\nBetween \"yes\" and \"ah,\"\nhow far apart are they?\nBetween good and evil,\nhow great is the difference?\nWhat the ruler fears\ncannot but be feared.\nVast and boundless—\nhas it ever reached its end?\n\nThe multitude bustles and rejoices,\nas if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,\nas if ascending the springtime terrace.\nI alone remain still, without sign,\nlike an infant who has not yet learned to smile.\nAdrift, adrift—\nas if with no place to return.\nThe multitude all have more than enough,\nwhile I alone seem to have lost something.\nAh, this heart of a fool—\nso muddled and dull!\nThe common folk are bright and clear,\nwhile I alone am dim.\nThe common folk are sharp and discerning,\nwhile I alone am dull and confused.",

      "translated_text": "Here the preceding chapter spoke of the Dao of governing the state—only by cutting off sagely wisdom and cunning profit can harm be avoided, and thus it expounded the function of non-action. This chapter speaks of the Dao of cultivating the self—only by cutting off worldly, superficial learning can care be avoided, and thus it reveals the essence of desirelessness.\n\n\"Ah\" and \"alas\"—\nto the wilds, oh, never ending—\n\nThese seven lines describe how the world’s learners are beset by many cares. From \"The multitude all bustle and brighten\" through \"I alone seem forsaken,\" these eight lines describe how I desire nothing from without. From \"My heart is that of a fool\" through \"stubborn and coarse,\" these ten lines describe how I seek no knowledge within. The final line directly answers the chapter’s opening line: what is cut off is worldly learning, while what is valued is the learning of feeding from the Mother.\n\nFor care arises from fear. Those in the world who pursue learning merely believe that good surpasses evil, strutting about in self-satisfaction—yet in my eyes, they are no different from \"ah\" and \"alas.\" Why? If we examine the original heart of such people, do they truly delight in \"ah\" and suffer from \"alas,\" delight in good and suffer from evil? Between the two, how far apart are they? Only because others all say \"ah\" and \"alas\"—despising those who say \"alas\" brings humiliation, while fearing evil brings loss of reputation and invites punishment—are they thus compelled to fear the former and do the latter. Driven by helplessness, they spend their whole lives clinging to this care, and in the wilds, oh, where is the end?\n\nYet in the minds of worldly people, do they truly know their many cares? They surely believe they seek joy, busily chasing things with no lack of zeal. And do the hearts of worldly people truly consider themselves ignorant? They surely believe themselves clear-sighted, viewing me as muddled, foolish, dull, and coarse. Then how could I alone willingly debase myself and differ from human nature? I surely have what I value—it simply differs from others.\n\nVirtue is the Mother of the myriad things, and the Dao is in turn the Mother of virtue. The multitude chase things and enslave their intelligence to supply their seeing, hearing, thinking, and pondering—they merely feed on the child. I alone forsake and abandon these, savoring the Dao and virtue to nourish myself. Thus, cutting off the learning of care and fear is precisely what it means to value the learning of feeding from the Mother.\n\nYet Yang Xiong said: \"If a person cuts off learning, though free from care, how is he different from a bird or beast?\" How could he have understood the meaning of cutting off learning? In serene indifference, before emotions and desires arise, like an infant who cannot yet laugh or cry, one does not yet know that external things can bring joy. One rides along with things without clinging to them. The multitude all have the heart that seeks surplus and gain, while I alone abandon it. How could I truly be so foolish as to be so muddled? For the Dao delights in insufficiency, and the heart without surplus is why others seem clear-sighted while I seem dull. Thus, this heart drifts boundlessly, like a boat in the vast sea, floating without mooring—this is the meaning of \"riding along as if with no place to return.\" This is the function of having and acting.\n\n\"Stubborn and coarse\" is like a rustic from distant lands who does not know the capital. \"Feeding from the Mother\" is found in the *Neize* chapter of the *Record of Rites*—it refers to a wet nurse.

      "translated_text": "The great—this follows from the self. It speaks of the bearing of abundant virtue, which all emerges from within the Dao. Dim and indistinct, it seems both present and absent; profound and obscure, it is entirely beyond sight. These all describe the nothingness of the Dao. That there are things and images is the manifestation of virtue—yet these are but its coarser aspects. Virtue is the source of things and images, and what is most refined within it. As *Zhuangzi* says: \"Take virtue as the root, take the root as the essence.\" This speaks of virtue issuing from the Dao.\n\n\"Reliability\" means verification. \"Fu\" is a direct term of designation; \"the multitude of fu\" is like saying \"the multitude of beings.\" The *Guangya* states: \"Fu means multitude.\" Wang Dao says: \"The bearing of great virtue is precisely what follows the unmanifest and formless in the preceding chapter. The bearing of abundant virtue all emerges from the Dao—this is why the sage values 'feeding from the mother.'\"\n\nBelow, the text repeatedly describes the marvel of the Dao’s essence. \"Things\" are images; \"true\" is essence; \"reliable\" is truth. The variation in phrasing serves the rhyme. \"The multitude of fu\" refers to the ten thousand things of heaven and earth, all of which emerge from the Dao. While the multitude of fu undergoes transformation and flux, the Dao remains eternally unchanged. Thus it is said: \"From ancient times to the present, its name does not depart, by which we observe the multitude of fu.\"\n\nHow do I know that the multitude of fu is observed by the Dao? Precisely because the Dao embodies perfect truth and reliability, unchanging and indestructible, it eternally governs the myriad images, like an inn that hosts passing travelers.\n\nLi Jiamo says: \"The 'being' within being—all take it to be real, yet do not know it is entirely illusory. The 'being' within nothingness—what people do not perceive yet do not know is most true. Only because it is true and not false does it neither persist through being nor vanish through nothingness. This is called 'having reliability.' Unchanging and unalterable through the ages, this is how the sage can observe the beginnings of the multitude of beings and know the reason for their existence. By embodying perfect nothingness, one can observe the multitude of beings.\"\n\nYuan’s note: Jiao Hong takes *fu* to mean \"beginning,\" saying that observing its subtleties empties the later boundary, while observing the multitude of beginnings empties the earlier boundary. When the ten thousand things arise together and one observes their return, then all is emptiness. Yao Nai further suggests that *fu* refers to sages and worthies, who all share this Dao, allowing one to know that the state of former sages and later sages is as one.

That it does not say “with little, one gains much” but separates them into two phrases is to introduce the following idea of embracing the One. *One* is the extreme of littleness, yet embracing it as the model for all under heaven, one thus gains much. Those who lose their lives do so by pursuing many paths, and the sheep is lost on the branching roads—all cases of being deluded by much. The next chapter speaks of “serving as the model for all under heaven,” “serving as the stream for all under heaven,” and “serving as the valley for all under heaven,” all in parallel. *Model* refers to what the carriage leans upon; though lowly, it is respected—thus likening it to the sage’s empty and humble virtue. The eye is most clear yet does not see itself; if the eye were to see itself, it would no longer be clear. Human self-righteousness, self-importance, and self-boasting are all the same. Those who can do this have no other secret: embracing the One, there is no self; with no self, there is no contention. Only by not contending does all under heaven gladly defer and preserve one whole by bending. “Bent, one is preserved whole” was an ancient saying that Laozi transmitted, so he further emphasizes: *How could this be empty words?* It is indeed the effect of a true principle. For straight words seem reversed, and though none under heaven fail to know them, none can practice them. Who is the one who holds fast and remains unconfused? His admonition is most earnest.}}\n\n○ Su Zhe said: “Straight but not in accord with principle is not truly straight. Following principle, though twisted, is the utmost straightness under heaven. What gathers flows downward; though one may wish not to be filled, it cannot be avoided. Clarity and scrutiny are not the Way; dullness and simplicity, though worn, are the source of daily renewal. The Dao is merely the One. Gaining its root, one gains everything; pursuing many ends, one is deluded. Embracing the One is returning to one’s nature. Bent and whole, twisted and straight, hollow and full, worn and new—all are the overflow of embracing the One. Thus, it concludes with embracing the One. Not seeing oneself, not being self-righteous, not being arrogant or boastful—all are the overflow of not contending.

      "translated_text": "Here the text is not adopted.}}\n\nThose who are sparing of speech act naturally.\nA whirlwind does not last the morning;\nA torrential rain does not last the day.\nWhat brings these about? Heaven and Earth.\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot make them last long—\nHow much less can man?\n\nThus, one who engages in the Dao becomes one with the Dao;\nOne who engages in virtue becomes one with virtue;\nOne who engages in loss becomes one with loss.\nOne who is one with the Dao, the Dao also attains;\nOne who is one with virtue, virtue also empowers;\nOne who is one with loss, loss also attains.\n\nWhere trust is insufficient, there is distrust.\nOne who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm;\nOne who strides does not walk.\nOne who displays himself is not enlightened;\nOne who is self-righteous is not distinguished;\nOne who boasts achieves no merit;\nOne who is self-conceited does not endure.\nIn relation to the Dao,\nThese are like surplus food and redundant growths—\nThings that others may detest.\nTherefore, one who possesses the Dao does not abide in them.\n\n{{The preceding chapter speaks of the conduct embraced by one who possesses the Dao; this chapter speaks of the faults contrary to the Dao. Their meanings mutually elucidate one another. Observe the four phrases—“displays himself,” “is self-righteous,” “boasts,” and “is self-conceited”—which recur from the preceding chapter, yet here they are stated negatively, whereas before they were stated positively. To be sparing of speech and to merge with the mysterious is to act naturally. The whirling of wind, the torrentiality of rain, standing on tiptoe, striding, surplus food, and redundant growths—none of these are natural. Thus, words spoken in due time are not resented; rain that arrives in proper measure is neither too swift nor too slow. If one forces clever speech to astonish the world, it is like a whirlwind or torrential rain—impressive only for a fleeting moment.\n\nThose who engage in the Dao, virtue, or loss refer generally to people in the world who pursue learning, divided into these three types. To preserve the natural is called the Dao; to attain the natural is called virtue; to lose the natural is called loss. The term “one with” is akin to the *Book of Documents*’ use of “one with order” or “one with disorder.” “Attains” means “follows.” Whether one pursues the Dao, virtue, or loss is not inherently distinct from birth; rather, those who engage in learning achieve differing results, hence their classification by type.\n\nThe Dao is fundamentally natural, yet people often lose it through contrivance—nothing more than self-inflicted error. As Wang Bi said: “Take non-action as the ruler, do not take speech as the teaching, and things will attain their truth, becoming one with the Dao in substance.” Thus it is said, “One who is one with the Dao.” With fewer encumbrances, one attains and acts in accord with virtue, becoming one with virtue in substance. Thus it is said, “One who is one with virtue.” With more encumbrances, one loses and acts in accord with loss, becoming one with loss in substance. Thus it is said, “One who is one with loss.” This interpretation is close to the mark, yet many commentators force it into the meaning of the perfected person’s mysterious merging with things—an unnatural stretch. Only Fu Yi’s ancient text preserves the evident meaning.\n\n“One who is one with loss” is what is meant by “trust is insufficient.” “Loss also attains” is what is meant by “there is distrust.” When one’s sincerity is insufficient, others do not trust; when others do not trust, one clamors with words to confuse them—how then can one be sparing of speech and act naturally?\n\nWu Cheng said: “From ‘sparing of speech’ to ‘there is distrust’ clarifies the attainment and loss of the Dao. From ‘one who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm’ onward, human conduct is illustrated by analogy to the preceding. Standing and walking also arise naturally; if one seeks to add to the natural—standing on tiptoe, striding, increasing height, extending length—how is this different from whirlwinds and torrential rains that cannot endure? Those who inwardly harbor self-display and self-righteousness, and outwardly flaunt self-conceit and self-boasting, when measured against the Dao of the natural, are no different from surplus food or redundant growths—both are excesses beyond what is proper. Between the hidden and the manifest, there are beings that detest them.” (Here, “beings” includes humans, ghosts, and spirits.)\n\nSima Guang said: *Xing* (conduct) and *xing* (form) were interchangeable in ancient script. Discarded surplus food makes people disgusted; attached redundant growths make people find them ugly.\n\nLü Huiqing said: “The Dao abides where the multitude detests, hence it is said, ‘things may detest them.’ Therefore, one who possesses the Dao does not abide there. Why? The lowly, empty, soft, and weak are what the multitude detests and discards; the lofty, overbearing, hard, and strong are what the multitude detests and contends for. Thus, not abiding in either is the same in being without contention.”}}\n\n**Chapter Twenty**",

      "translated_text": "With heavy baggage, though one travels all day, one does not become light—why? Because weight is the root. With serene dwelling, though there be glory and splendor, one does not become restless—why? Because stillness is the lord. Thus to be light is to lose the root of weight; to be restless is to lose the lord of stillness.\n\nMaster Lü Huiqing said: All things that are light respond first; those that are heavy respond later. Thus the root can govern the branches. Stillness commands things; restlessness is commanded by things. Therefore stillness can lord over restlessness. Even in movement and dwelling, one cannot depart from this principle—how much less so for one who bears heavy responsibility and travels the long Dao to govern all under heaven, who could afford not to be still and weighty? To respond only after being moved, to act only when unavoidable—this is weight. To act as if not acting—this is stillness. If one’s movements are always in moments of unavoidable necessity yet cannot be without action, this is to treat one’s person as light before all under heaven and not as weighty. Without weight, one becomes restless and cannot be still.\n\nMaster Li Jiamo said: Traveling must include heavy baggage—this illustrates how the sage, though reaching everywhere in the course of a day, never departs from the root. Glory and splendor, serene dwelling—this illustrates how the sage, though doing all things, constantly practices non-action. If one who rules all under heaven merely drives oneself to the ends of things, then a single matter is enough to enslave them—how then could they firmly control all under heaven?\n\nMaster Wu Cheng said: \"To treat one’s person as light before all under heaven\" means to act lightly above all under heaven. Heavy baggage and serene dwelling are but one example. Whether in governing the mind, cultivating the body, managing the state by dwelling in weight to command the light, or in military strategy by using stillness to control movement—none depart from this principle.",

      "translated_text": "To \"take\" here follows the sense in the *Zuozhuan*—\"taking our fields and dividing them into lots\"—and the *Records of the Grand Historian*—\"taking the High Emperor’s covenants and altering them at will.\" Yuan’s note: *qǔ* (取) is a grammatical particle. *Wéi* (为) means \"to act\"; *zhí* (执) means \"to grasp.\" For example, with pottery: if one does not follow its natural course but forces it to take shape, it will surely turn out flawed and ruined. Or with a treasure: grasping it tightly and refusing to let go, fearing its loss, may instead cause it to slip and fall. How much more so with the vessel of the world—the sacred vessel! The sacred vessel is Heaven’s mandate and the human heart, whose rise and fall are without constancy and cannot be contended by human effort. Thus it is called \"sacred.\" One who leads does not expect others to follow, yet they may follow of their own accord—this is how non-action does not fail to attain. One who exhales expects the other to receive, yet they may refuse and instead blow back—this is how action does not necessarily succeed. One may strengthen oneself to remain firm, yet at times grow weak. One may carry something in perfect safety, yet it may suddenly collapse. Thus, those who grasp do not necessarily avoid loss. Therefore, the sage in dealing with things eliminates excess and dares not overreach. In self-cultivation, the sage eliminates extravagance and excess and dares not overreach. Thus, the troubles of contention and overflowing fullness do not arise in the heart. Without scheming for things, things naturally come; without clinging to things, things naturally do not depart.\n\nBo Huihui said: All things have their own natural nature—how can one act to harm it? Thus, the sage eliminates excess, eliminates extravagance, eliminates extremity, only following their natural course. What the sage calls \"excess,\" \"extravagance,\" and \"extremity\" do not refer to the later ages’ ostentatious and excessive practices. Anything that adds contrivance beyond simplicity and ease falls into this category. The *Book of Han*’s *Biography of Huang Ba* states: \"In all governance, one must eliminate what is too extreme.\" Though the words derive from this passage, the meaning differs. If an affair is overly excessive, remove it; if it is minor and harmless, there is no need to alter it—this is the intent of the Han scholars. Things have their inherent nature and cannot be forced; affairs have their proper measure and cannot be exceeded—this is the original meaning of Laozi.\n\nLu Dian said: Eliminating excess is kindness; eliminating extravagance is frugality; eliminating extremity is not daring to put oneself first in the world. These three are how the sage comes to possess the world.\n\nLü Huiqing said: Laozi speaks of taking the world always through non-action. Non-action means following the self-so of the myriad things and not daring to act. Thus, one can win the hearts of the world and cause them not to depart—not through contrivance. Only the Dao can govern vessels. The world’s vessel is the sacred vessel; without the sacred Dao, there is no way to govern it. The sacred is without thought, without action. To act is to govern by means not of the Dao. The sage eliminates excess, eliminates extravagance, eliminates extremity—all to assist the self-so of the myriad things and not dare to act.",

As Huang Sheng lived in the early Song dynasty, he was still able to see it. However, as the text has been transmitted for so long, we retain it here in its traditional form.\n\n---\n\nThe Dao of Heaven favors return. Thus, to rely on military strength to dominate the world is not the way of one who understands the Dao. He who assists a ruler through the Dao must not do so—how much less, then, one who rules by the Dao himself? Below, it exhausts the people’s strength, and thorns and brambles grow. Above, it violates the seasons of Heaven, and thus there are years of famine.\n\nThe so-called \"good\" refers to one who embodies the Dao.

      "translated_text": "Thus, enumerating these instances where resolve is required serves to clarify. The character *er* (而) here should be read as *yu* (于). In ancient usage, *er* and *yu* were interchangeable, their sounds close and meanings akin. Others may act resolutely in that regard, yet I alone act resolutely in this.\n\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—this is the Dao of Heaven. To defy this is to act without the Dao. No wonder that which arises violently must perish early.\n\n{The character *jia* (佳) has no gloss as \"fine\" or \"excellent.\" Some suggest it is an abbreviation of *wei* (惟). Wang Shiqu notes that *jia* is a corruption of *fu wei* (夫惟), where the left component *xin* (忄) of *wei* was lost in transmission, leading scribes to miswrite it as *jia*. His argument is sound. Yet since the Han period, the phrase \"fine weapons are inauspicious\" (*jia bing bu xiang*) has existed, indicating that *jia* in this context is also an ancient reading. Others propose the gloss from the *Guang Ya*: \"wearisome\" (*jia lao ye*), which also fits the meaning. However, Fu Yi’s edition simply writes \"fine weapons\" (*mei bing*), suggesting *jia* is a loan for *jia* (嘉), aligning with the sense of the following text.}\n\nThe left pertains to yang and life; the right to yin and death. Thus, fortune and misfortune hold opposing values. *Tian* (恬) is not joy; *dan* (憺) is not richness—these refer to what the heart does not delight in.\n\n○ Li Jiamo states: \"He who kills another’s father will have his own father killed. He who kills another’s elder brother will have his own elder brother killed. This is called 'favoring return.' If by chance one’s weapons prevail, the vengeful qi they invoke cannot be made to flourish by earth, nor can it be accumulated by Heaven. Thus, the fate of those who do not prevail is self-evident. Therefore, the skilled warrior engages in battle only when unavoidable, acts resolutely in a single decisive strike, and does not thereby seek dominance. 'Resolute' (*guo*) means 'not enduring.' One inwardly maintains the mindset of necessity while outwardly committing to a single decisive action. Thus, one never boasts, never aggrandizes, never acts insolently, never seeks dominance—all arises from necessity. If one could avoid battle yet does not, weapons age and qi wanes, just as a person in their prime must grow old. Even those who act without the Dao do not live out their years—how much less the aging of weapons? From this, the way of the humane being without enemies can be known.\n\nTo speak of warfare, one must first take no delight in killing. Sun [Wu] and Wu [Qi] discuss strategy, examining emptiness and fullness, distinguishing the orthodox and the extraordinary—their words are exhaustive. Yet the root of emptiness and fullness, the orthodox and the extraordinary, Sun and Wu may not have grasped. Laozi says: 'Serenity and tranquility are supreme; victory is not fine.' This is his intent to avoid battle. Even from the perspective of military strategy, serenity and tranquility mean stillness, and stillness is the root of victory. Frenzy and agitation mean movement, and movement is the foundation of defeat. Mencius said: 'He who does not delight in killing can unify the world.' From ancient times to the present, has the Dao of Heaven ever faltered?\"",
      "overlap_context": " so—how much less, then, one who rules by the Dao himself? Below, it exhausts the people’s strength, and thorns and brambles grow. Above, it violates the seasons of Heaven, and thus there are years of famine.\n\nThe so-called \"good\" refers to one who embodies the Dao. Arrogance stems from self-reliance; aggression from self-aggrandizement; and insolence from wanton excess. These three maladies share a single source.

      "translated_text": "The Dao is eternally nameless. Though the uncarved block is small, none under Heaven can make it a subject. Should lords and kings hold fast to it, the myriad things will of themselves submit. Heaven and Earth unite to send down sweet dew; none command it, yet it spreads evenly of itself.\n\nWhen the first system creates names, once names exist, one must also know to stop. Knowing to stop is how one avoids peril. The Dao’s presence in the world is like valleys and streams in relation to rivers and seas.\n\n---\n\nThe Dao—this is the so-called eternal Dao. The Dao takes namelessness as its constancy, and thus can only be named by the nameless uncarved block. The uncarved block, as a thing, is neither carved nor polished; its essence is subtle and imperceptible, hence nameless. Yet at the beginning of Heaven and Earth, the myriad things rely on it to live—so who under Heaven would dare make a subject of that from which they are born and by which they begin? Should lords and kings hold fast to it, this is seeing the small and calling it enlightened, knowing to guard the mother while using the child. Guarding it to govern the myriad things, could any thing fail to submit? It is like yin and yang harmonizing to form rain and dew, nurturing the myriad things—though none commands it, it naturally spreads everywhere. When lords and kings grasp the guiding thread of the Dao, none command it, yet the myriad things submit of themselves—it is just like this.\n\nFor lords and kings to guard the uncarved block is to guard its namelessness. Guarding its namelessness, one can then establish names. To establish is to carve the uncarved block and divide it—rites, music, governance, and punishment all derive from this. Yet if one pursues the branches and forgets the root, one will drift ever farther and lose the source. Therefore, one must not over-rely, not seek excessively, but value stopping. To stop is to anchor with the nameless uncarved block. From namelessness one establishes names, so vessels come into being; returning with names to guard the nameless, the uncarved block does not scatter. How could one not know constancy and recklessly act, inviting misfortune?\n\nThus the Dao’s presence in the world is like water in rivers and seas: from root to branch, the branch never departs from the root. For lords and kings, can one not guard the uncarved block to govern things?\n\nWu Cheng says: The beginning is the Dao; names are virtue. The Dao’s namelessness becomes virtue, so names also come to exist. Those who use these names should know to stop at virtue, not pursue the branches and drift ever farther. \"Will\" means not being pressed by words.\n\nSu Zhe says: The uncarved block is nature. The Dao is eternally nameless, so as a thing it expands without limit and contracts without residue—this is why, though small, it cannot be made a subject. Thus even a commoner of lowly status, if he guards it, can mold Yao and Shun, while a lord or king of exalted rank, if he cannot guard it, will find the myriad things unruly. The ascending and descending of harmonious qi unite to send down sweet dew, moistening the myriad things evenly without exception. The sage embodies the supreme Dao to respond to all things—it is just like this. This is how he can make the myriad things submit. The sage scatters the uncarved block to make vessels and establishes names based on vessels—how could he pursue names and forget the uncarved block, be deluded by branches and lose the root? He also knows to return to nature, and thus rides the myriad changes without peril.\n\nLi Jiamo says: When Heaven and Earth unite, they send down sweet dew to give life to the myriad things. From this we see that though Heaven and Earth are divided, they need not be separate. Though the Dao scatters into things and things each have names, the Dao never abandons things. Only if things do not abandon the Dao themselves can they stand between Heaven and Earth without peril, for the Dao still gives them life. Thus if one knows to stop at the uncarved block, things will not be diminished by the Dao’s scattering, nor will the Dao be scattered by things’ arising—like the qi of valleys and streams, which never fails to flow into rivers and seas, and the qi of rivers and seas, which never fails to flow into valleys and streams. Root and branch never cease their daily circulation. Those who pursue branches and depart from the root—how could they understand this?\n\n---\n\nRight Chapter Twenty-Seven\n\nOne who knows others is wise; one who knows oneself is enlightened. One who conquers others has strength; one who conquers oneself is powerful. One who knows contentment is rich; one who acts with perseverance has resolve. One who does not lose their place endures; one who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\n\n---\n\nLü Huiqing says: Knowing constancy is called enlightenment, so enlightenment is surely what wisdom arises from. One who cannot turn inward cannot know constancy. If one can know constancy, what difficulty is there in knowing others? Guarding softness is called power, so power is surely what strength arises from. One who cannot master oneself cannot guard softness. If one can guard softness, what difficulty is there in conquering others? One with the enlightenment of self-knowledge knows that the myriad things are all complete within oneself and has no need to seek outside, hence is rich. One with the power of self-conquest diligently practices the Dao and is not hindered or swayed by external changes, hence has resolve. Knowing contentment within and acting with perseverance, one can preserve what one preserves and not be moved by things, hence endures.",

Not losing what one holds—even in death, not perishing—are all effects of guarding the constant Dao.\"\n\nMaster Li Jiamo said: \"Spirit and essence manifest externally as wisdom and power, internally as enlightenment and strength. What prevents people from entering the Dao is that their self-perception is unclear, and thus they are overcome by things. If one is inwardly enlightened, one naturally does not chase externals. Not chasing externals, one gradually gains the ability to overcome things. With the accumulation of days, one naturally enters the Dao. Knowing contentment, wisdom becomes ever clearer; acting with perseverance, power becomes ever more steadfast. Cultivation and awakening both perfected, one gradually returns to one’s nature.

He Shang writes *never acts as great*; Wang Bi writes *because he never deems himself great*.}\n\n{*The ten thousand things rely on it to live yet it makes no refusal*: This speaks of the Dao’s expenditure—what is called its vast application. *Its work complete, it claims no possession*: This speaks of the Dao’s concealment—what is called its subtle essence. Precisely because its essence is subtle, it possesses the power to clothe and nourish the ten thousand things yet claims no possession, returning to formlessness and namelessness, gathering itself into something smaller than a hair’s tip. Precisely because its application is vast, the ten thousand things that rely on it to live all return to it in boundless abundance, unaware of its exclusive mastery, extending even to the point where all things grow together without harm—its capacity may fill the Six Directions. Thus, *ever without desire, it may be called small*: the uncarved block is small yet reveals the subtle—this is its essence. *The ten thousand things return to it, and it may be called great*: the ten thousand things come to submit of themselves, revealing the boundary—this is its function. When it is small, no trace of it appears; when it is great, nothing lies beyond it. Thus the sage who embodies the Dao is likewise: he ever guards the smallness of the uncarved block, refusing to deem himself great, yet the ten thousand things all return to him. From this we know that the Great Dao cannot be achieved by human effort. ○ Su Zhe said: That which flows freely, without fixed form or prohibition, is the Great Dao. The world has those who give life to things yet claim possession; those who shun merit yet refuse to give life. Only the Dao gives life without refusal, accomplishes without possession. If one is great yet harbors the mind of greatness, one is small. Lü Huiqing said: Only because its work is complete yet it does not dwell in it does it remain without desire—without desire is the utmost subtlety, and so it may be called small. Only because the ten thousand things rely on it to live do they turn and return to it, unaware of its mastery—this is the utmost capacity, and so it may be called great. Since it is small yet may be called great, and great yet may be called small, it cannot be named great or small. This is why the Dao is concealed in namelessness, and the sage embodies it through namelessness, never deeming himself great, yet nothing surpasses his greatness. For only because it may turn left or right is it neither small nor great; only because it is neither small nor great can it accomplish greatness.}\n\nChapter Twenty-Ninth",

Lü Huiqing says: *Ping* is the utmost of peace; *tai* is the utmost of tranquility. “Peace and tranquility” means resting in equanimity. Li Jiamo says: The foolish go yet do not return; those with the Dao go yet are unharmed. Those who “go yet do not return” abandon the Dao to follow things. Those who “go yet are unharmed” move together with the Dao. Having joined with the Dao, going without departing from it, there is nothing not at peace, nothing not balanced, nothing not tranquil. In relation to forms and vessels, it is like a traveler’s temporary lodging. If, for the sake of music and delicacies, one lingers and does not depart, there is nothing that does not become a calamity. Thus the sage grasps the Great Image and proceeds, and though following things, constantly moves together with the Dao.}",

      "translated_text": "All things in their momentum follow this same principle, which aligns with the *Yi Jing*’s cycles of ebb and flow, waxing and waning. Some say that the phrase \"lend to others\" in the *Shuo Yuan* should read \"lend to people,\" for the art of expansion and contraction, opening and closing, is a method by which the sage eliminates violence and dissolves evil—yet petty men may also borrow it to pursue their private ends. The *Yin Fu Jing* states: \"Its mechanism of theft—none in the world can see it, none can know it. The noble man who attains it preserves his person; the petty man who attains it squanders his life.\" This is what is meant by \"not lending to others.\"\n\nWang Bi said: To remove the strong and violent and dispel chaos and disorder, one must employ these four principles in accordance with the nature of things, allowing them to destroy themselves without resorting to the force of punishment. Thus it is called \"subtle illumination.\" If you would fill it to its fullness, first let it expand to its limit. If you would expand it further after it is already full, the multitude will naturally contract. Should you attempt to govern it before its expansion is complete, its momentum will not have reached its peak, and you will instead endanger yourself.\n\nSu Zhe said: To take away without first having given is to act before the momentum is fully realized and the principle fully established. If the momentum is not fully realized, seizing it will be difficult; if the principle is not fully established, things will not submit. This is the profound investigation of the subtlest dynamics, no different from the methods of Guan Zhong or Sun Wu. The sage rides the principle, while the common world employs cunning. Riding the principle is like a physician’s skill in treating illness; employing cunning is like a merchant’s skill in pursuing profit. Thus, when the world’s strong and violent contend and clash, I alone meet them with softness and weakness. When the great are wounded and the small perish, I sit unmoving and await their demise. Does the sage intentionally act thus to overcome things? He knows the natural course of momentum and abides in its spontaneity.\n\nFish, as creatures, do not possess claws or fangs sharp enough to overcome other beings. Yet when they dwell in the deep abyss, even the strong and powerful cannot control them. The sage’s dwelling in softness and weakness, so that the strong and violent cannot harm him, is likewise. Not only can they not harm him, but he will ultimately preserve and control what follows. Is this not the state’s sharpest instrument? How could the multitude ever comprehend it?\n\nWang Dao said: Creation has its cycles of ebb and flow, waxing and waning; human affairs have their principles of fortune and misfortune, concealment and emergence. Thus, when things are about to become one way, they must have already been another. What will be has not yet taken shape, but what has been is already visible. To grasp what has been and thereby foresee what will be—this is the work of subtle illumination. Yet it must be subtle *and* illuminated; to make its subtlety *visible* is not permissible. Therefore, one conceals this principle to nurture oneself, remaining profoundly still, withdrawn, and yielding, at ease in oneself—like a fish that does not leave the depths. To flaunt this principle before others is to provoke conflict and invite trouble, to arm bandits and instruct thieves—like showing the state’s sharp instrument to others, which is improper. The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Robber’s Satchel\" chapter clearly expresses this idea. When the sage employs it, it becomes the great Dao; when usurped by villains, it becomes the tactics of vertical and horizontal alliances. Its words are sharper than blades. Thus, the sage does not display the sharp instrument to others.\n\nWu Cheng said: Laozi spoke of reversal as the movement of the Dao, calling its power \"mysterious and profound, distant, returning to the root of things.\" Its way largely opposes the common view, so he used these several examples of reversal as analogies, ultimately returning to the theme of the soft overcoming the hard and the weak overcoming the strong. Followers of Sun Wu and Shen Buhai, who employ such tactics to ensnare others in death without awareness, are often said to derive their ideas from Laozi. Thus, some claim that no one in the world would dare accept what Laozi offers. This is also a flaw in the way such teachings are framed. Therefore, \"the state’s sharp instrument must not be lent to others\"—Laozi himself has already made this clear.",

      "translated_text": "Where there is \"no *wei* (為),\" *wei* means \"to employ.\" *Rang* (攘) is an ancient form of *rang* (让, \"to yield\"). *Reng* (扔) is interchangeable with *reng* (仍, \"repeatedly\"). This speaks of yielding again and again before accepting.\n\nBenevolence, righteousness, ritual propriety, and wisdom are all lesser *virtue/power*, and thus all are spoken of as \"upper\" rather than \"lower.\" This is to push the distinction to its extreme and clarify their boundaries.\n\nUpper *virtue/power* approaches the Dao, and thus it is \"non-doing\" (*wuwei*) yet nothing is left undone.\nUpper benevolence approaches *virtue/power*, and thus it acts yet without *wei*.\nBy the time of righteousness, even its upper form is truly lesser *virtue/power*, and thus it acts with *wei*.\nRitual propriety is yet lower in *virtue/power*, and thus when one acts, none respond—one must repeatedly yield before accepting. This is the extreme of having no *virtue/power* while not losing *virtue/power*.\n\nWu Cheng said: In the first chapter of the *Laozi*'s upper scroll, *Dao* and *virtue/power* were spoken of separately but not yet clearly distinguished. In the first chapter of the lower scroll, *Dao*, *virtue/power*, benevolence, righteousness, ritual propriety, and wisdom are all delineated—this is the core of its teaching. Our Confucians take *Dao* and *virtue/power* as a single term; when spoken of separately, they become benevolence, righteousness, ritual propriety, and wisdom, all inherent in Heaven and originally present in human nature, with no distinction of refinement or coarseness. The *Laozi*, however, takes the Dao as nameless, while *virtue/power* has a name. From *virtue/power* to benevolence, righteousness, ritual propriety, and wisdom, each step descends further. Thus, in this chapter, *virtue/power* that nears the Dao is called upper *virtue/power*; benevolence that nears *virtue/power* is called upper benevolence; righteousness that nears benevolence is called upper righteousness; ritual propriety that nears righteousness is called upper ritual propriety. After ritual propriety, it speaks of \"prior knowledge,\" taking wisdom as the lowest. Its use of \"substantial and superficial,\" \"real and flowery\" is because the Dao is like the fruit of a tree—its vital principle lies within, its core hidden before sprouting. After sprouting, *virtue/power* is its root, benevolence its trunk, righteousness its branches, ritual propriety its leaves, and wisdom its blossoms. The Dao is the fruit, wisdom the blossom; the fruit is real, the blossom empty. The root is substantial, the leaves thin. Thus it says: \"Ritual propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust; prior knowledge is the flower of the Dao.\" The great man would rather hold to the substantial and real of Dao and *virtue/power* than abandon them for the flowery and thin of ritual propriety and wisdom.\n\nWang Bi said: The person of upper *virtue/power* employs only the Dao, does not *virtue/power* their *virtue/power*, holds no attachments, and makes no use of it. Thus, though they possess *virtue/power*, they have no name for it. The person of lesser *virtue/power* governs things through the name of goodness, and thus the name of *virtue/power* exists. When the name of goodness arises, there are those who do not respond, and thus they do not lose *virtue/power* yet have no *virtue/power*. \"Without *wei*\" means without partial action. Is not the greatest of all the Dao? When the Dao is lost, then comes *virtue/power*. The measure of lesser *virtue/power* reaches its limit at upper benevolence and stops. Though it employs *wuwei*, it cannot embody *wuwei*. Employing *wuwei* still grasps the mother, and thus one need not labor while things order themselves. Below this, one cannot practice *wuwei* and values broad giving; unable to give broadly, one values uprightness; unable to be upright, one values adorned reverence. Benevolence and righteousness arise from within, yet even when acted upon, they are artificial—how much more so when one strives for external adornment? Can this endure? The depth of benevolent *virtue/power* cannot be achieved by employing benevolence; the uprightness of righteous conduct cannot be accomplished by employing righteousness; the purity of ritual reverence cannot be aided by employing ritual propriety. If one grasps the mother of all efficacy, carries it with the great Dao, and stabilizes it with the nameless, then the mind has no schemes, affairs employ their sincerity, and benevolence, righteousness, ritual propriety, and reverence are all the Dao. If one abandons the mother to employ the child, discards the root to pursue the branches, then names have divisions, forms have limits. Though one may extend them greatly, there will inevitably be incompleteness; though one may amplify their beauty, there will inevitably be anxiety. This is what the highest does not accept.\n\nSu Zhe said: *Virtue/power* has upper and lower, but benevolence and righteousness have only upper—why? Lesser *virtue/power* lies between benevolence and righteousness, and what is below benevolence and righteousness is not worth speaking of. Those of loyalty and trust can study ritual propriety. When ritual propriety is established, the beauty of loyalty and trust radiates outward, but within, it is exhausted and nothing remains.",

      "translated_text": "The One is the virtue of emptiness and tranquility. The \"embracing the One\" mentioned earlier, the \"blending into One,\" and the \"Dao/Way giving birth to the One\"—all refer to this. Zhuangzi also calls it the Great One. This natural virtue in its function is empty yet not full, yielding yet not leading, soft yet not hard, weak yet not strong. The text repeatedly speaks of this, and this chapter fully reveals its essence. Those who attain it are said to have gained this One as their virtue.\n\nHeaven, Earth, the valley spirit, and the four are different in name but the same in reality. To split is to break apart. To emit is to discharge and shake. To cease is to dissolve and lose efficacy. To exhaust is to wither and lose fullness. To perish is to fade and lose life. To stumble is to fall. *Zhen* is the same as *zhen* (pillar); *zhen* is the backbone of affairs. \"To be the pillar of the world\" means to be the people’s ultimate standard.\n\nLaozi wrote this text to guide the world, so the following passage speaks specifically to lords and kings. First, he says that humility is the root and lowliness is the foundation, but later only mentions humility as the root—this is for brevity. The earlier passage on attaining the One already focused on the use of weakness, but at the end, reversion and weakness are spoken of in parallel. This is because reversion traces the origin of weakness, while weakness points to the reality of reversion. Whenever reversion is mentioned, it is to employ weakness; whenever weakness is mentioned, it is to oppose the movements and existences of the multitude. There is no reversion beyond weakness.\n\nThe stillness of the Dao/Way is fundamentally non-being, so its movement always opposes. The essence of non-being is emptiness, so its function always takes weakness as its affair. All things are born of *qi*, and *qi* is born of the Dao/Way. *Qi* takes form, but the Dao/Way is formless—this is why being and non-being oppose each other.\n\nWang Bi said: Purity cannot make itself pure, fullness cannot make itself full—they all depend on their mother to exist without form. Thus, purity is not to be prized, nor is fullness to be esteemed. What is prized lies in the mother, and the mother has no prized form. What is prized thus originates in the lowly. Therefore, to amass numerous carriages is to have no carriage. Jade and stone, gleaming and clattering, are entirely bound by their forms—hence they are not desired. The high takes the low as its foundation; the noble takes the lowly as its root; being takes non-being as its function—this is their reversion. When all movement knows its non-being, things flow freely. Thus, it is said: \"Reversion is the movement of the Dao/Way.\"\n\nLi Jiamo said: What is this One? To know why Heaven is clear is to know why Earth is stable. To know why the spirit is efficacious is to know why the valley is full. To know why the myriad things are born is to know why lords and kings serve as the world’s pillar. For in the end, all being arises from non-being—this is never not One. If one does not know the One, one must set oneself apart; setting oneself apart, one must cut off from things. If lords and kings cut off from things, things will also cut off from them.\n\nLi Zhi said: If lords and kings do not know the Dao/Way of attaining the One, they are no different from commoners. Thus, they inevitably exalt themselves by their nobility, and the exalted must stumble—for the high lacks a foundation. Only the low can be humble. Why? The principle of attaining the One means commoners are not lowly, nor are lords and kings noble. Consider how wheel, spokes, canopy, axle, crossbar, and yoke come together to form a carriage—people only see it as a carriage, not as the many parts that assemble it, for originally there was no such thing as a carriage. Extending this, lords, kings, and commoners—people only see their nobility and lowliness, highness and lowness, not knowing they all attain the One. Those who cling to the appearances they see and cannot humble themselves despite their nobility are merely gleaming and clattering like jade and stone. Thus, to know reversion and weakness, there is nothing more than attaining the One to reach non-being.\n\nChen Yidian said: \"Attaining\" is thus the utmost. To amass carriages is to have no carriage—from being, by counting, one reaches non-being. This is the utmost of humility. Gleaming and clattering both imply rigidity and inability to be soft and weak—this is the opposite of humility.\n\nYuan’s note: Zhuangzi described Laozi’s learning as establishing it on constant non-being and taking the Great One as its core, with softness, weakness, humility, and yielding as its outward expression. The \"attaining the One\" in this chapter refers to the virtue of emptiness and non-fullness, for it approaches non-being. It is also illustrated by lords and kings calling themselves \"solitary,\" \"widowed,\" and \"unworthy,\" for they approach the One. Heaven and Earth, the myriad things—all being arises from non-being. Thus, Heaven does not know its clarity, Earth does not know its stability, the spirit does not know its efficacy, the valley does not know its fullness, the myriad things do not know their birth—so too do lords and kings not know their nobility and highness. This is evident. Those who do not know their own clarity and stability...",

      "translated_text": "Without intent it moves, without action it accomplishes. Those who do not know their own efficacy or fullness—are quiescent and empty. Those who do not know their own arising—are self-so. Those who do not know their own nobility and loftiness—are lowly and humble. Quiescence thus gives rise to efficacy, emptiness thus gives rise to fullness. Without intent and without action, clarity and stability arise. Self-so, they do not await birth yet are born. Self-lowly and self-humble, they become the standard for all under Heaven. This is what attaining the One brings about.\n\nNow, nobility and loftiness are the opposite of lowliness and humility—how then can they be unified as One? Consider lords and kings: they are seen as such only by others. If one traces this to its ultimate origin, accumulated lowliness constitutes nobility, and at the beginning of differentiation, there is no nobility to speak of. Accumulated humility constitutes loftiness, and at the beginning of differentiation, there is no loftiness to speak of. It is like assembling many materials to make a carriage—at the root of differentiation, there is no carriage to speak of. When there is nothing to speak of in terms of nobility or lowliness, loftiness or humility, how could it merely be that lowliness is the root and humility the foundation? Rather, even the self is dissolved. Without self, there is no other; without self and other, there is no loftiness or humility, no nobility or lowliness. In this way, loftiness and humility are One, nobility and lowliness are One, self and other are One. Wherever one goes, there is nothing—thus wherever one goes, there is the One. How then could this be contrary to the unyielding hardness of jade and stone, which set themselves apart from other things?\n\nYet what people perceive as opposition is the movement of the Dao. What they perceive as weakness is the functioning of the Dao. For movement arises from stillness, being arises from non-being. Not only does the form of a carriage arise from non-being—even the forms of Heaven and Earth, valleys, spirits, and the myriad things arise from non-being. Non-being and being are opposites, so those who embody the Dao are also opposed to those who cling to being. Those who cling to being are strong, while those who embody non-being are weak. Unable to embody non-being, they cannot even maintain softness. Thus, the difference between having a self and having none is what distinguishes attaining the One from failing to attain it.",

      "translated_text": "The *Heshang Gong* edition divides the text from \"sparse and scattered\" onward as one chapter, and the four lines beginning with \"Reversal\" as another. However, upon examination, the following chapter speaks of \"being able to bear the nation’s filth\" as the master of the altars of soil and grain, and \"being able to bear the nation’s misfortune\" as the king of all under Heaven—immediately followed by \"True words seem contradictory.\" This chapter speaks of feudal lords calling themselves \"the orphaned, the widowed, the unworthy,\" immediately followed by \"Reversal is the movement of the Dao.\" This clearly demonstrates the continuity of meaning. Moreover, the passage on \"several carriages yet no carriage\" embodies the principle that \"being arises from non-being.\" Only when these are combined into a single chapter is the meaning complete. As for Wu Cheng’s proposal to merge the last four lines with the next two chapters into one, though the meaning may be coherent, the text itself is disjointed. Yao Nai, on the other hand, merges this chapter with the next, moving the twenty-five characters from \"The Dao gives birth to the One\" to \"the qi of harmony\" to the beginning of this chapter, and relocating the twenty-nine characters from \"Valuing the lowly as the root\" to \"Is it not so?\" above the line \"What people despise\" in the following chapter, claiming these are misplaced slips.

      "translated_text": "The *Shuowen* states: \"a knot in silk.\" The *Zuozhuan* speaks of \"flaws in punishment,\" with the annotation \"unevenness.\" Wang Bi explains: \"The great, leveling Dao follows the nature of things, not clinging to flatness to carve them away.\" If a square does not align with the carpenter’s square, how can it have corners? If heaven’s countenance cannot be painted, how can it have form? Who but one who embodies the complete Dao could be thus?\n\nMaster Lu Xisheng says: \"That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel. The Dao is what transcends form.\" The superior person knows the subtle and the manifest, thus hearing the Dao, they believe and diligently practice it. The mediocre person stands between the subtle and the manifest, thus hearing the Dao, they waver between doubt and belief. The inferior person knows only the manifest and not the subtle, confined within form, thus hearing the Dao, they laugh loudly. To laugh at it is to reject it.\n\nThose of old who were adept in the Dao were subtly wondrous and profoundly penetrating, too deep to be known. If they were not laughed at by the inferior person, they would not be worthy of the Dao.\n\nMaster Li Jiamo says: \"The diligence of the superior person is not forced diligence; they act from insight. The laughter of the inferior person is not deliberate laughter; they laugh from lack of insight. If one neither attains the diligence of the superior nor the laughter of the inferior, unable to perceive yet also unable to trust what they perceive, they will remain in a state of uncertainty, neither present nor absent.\n\nOne who embodies the Dao is luminous of themselves, not by borrowed light; externally, none can perceive it, thus seeming obscure. One who advances in the Dao progresses of themselves, not by forced effort; externally, none can know it, thus seeming to retreat. The great white does not stain its nature; if its nature remains unstained, harmonizing with dust is permissible, thus seeming disgraced. Abundant virtue must be perceived in the great; if perceived in the great, even if one wished to halt it, it cannot be stopped, thus seeming insufficient. One who establishes virtue internally grounds their own nature, thus engaging with things must be simple, seeming indolent. One of unadulterated truth does not follow externals, thus they go where they will, seeming to change.\n\nIn this way, they cannot be examined by edges or corners, nor exhausted by what is complete or incomplete, nor known by sound, nor grasped by form or vessel. Those mediocre and inferior persons, bound by their own perceptions, judge the traces of the Dao as truly obscure, truly retreating, truly flawed, truly disgraced, truly altered. Few among them would not mock and ridicule.\n\nMaster Lü Huiqing says: \"Called luminous yet seeming obscure, called advancing yet seeming to retreat, called level yet seeming flawed—even to the point of supreme sound scarce of voice, form without shape, name and reality ever appearing contrary. Thus the reality of the Dao is concealed in nothingness. Precisely because of this, when one gives to others, one’s own abundance increases; when one bestows upon others, one’s own store grows greater.

Weakness entails reduction; strength entails augmentation. To augment oneself by overpowering others brings the reduction of an untimely death. Is this not what is meant by “augmenting yet reducing”? To reduce oneself through utmost softness and non-being yields the augmentation of swift movement and penetrating power.

The Three refers to the *qi* of yin and yang in harmonious union—this is what is called the \"penetrating *qi*.\" The myriad things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang in their arms; through the penetrating *qi* they attain harmony.

Their ears, eyes, mouth, and nose face forward—this is the movement of yang. Plants likewise turn their backs to the cold and face the warmth.

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: \"I also teach this.\" The mother governs nurturance; the father governs instruction. Hence, when speaking of life, we say \"nourished by the mother\"; when speaking of teaching, we say \"instructed by the father.\" \"Driving and deploying\" describes their function. It does not say \"unyielding strength\" but \"utmost firmness\"—this is a shift in phrasing to match the rhyme.\n\nWang Bi says: Water flows without obstruction; *qi* penetrates without limit. Softness, weakness, emptiness, and nothingness—there is nowhere they do not reach. The softest cannot be broken; the formless cannot be exhausted. Extending this principle, we thus recognize the benefits of non-action.\n\nLi Jiamo says: When it is the Dao, even \"one\" has not yet arisen—how could there be two? Yet with the presence of yang comes yin; with yin and yang comes their interaction, and from this, nothing is absent. The myriad things embrace yang—this is one. They bear yin—this is two. Yin and yang interact, and the penetrating *qi* becomes harmony—this is three. What among the myriad things does not possess these three? Since they fundamentally arise from the Dao, their end does not lose their origin.\n\n\"Orphaned, widowed, and barren\"—these are the titles by which kings and lords refer to themselves. This is how reduction gives rise to increase. \"The strong and aggressive do not meet a natural death\"—this is how increase gives rise to reduction. Since reduction and increase share the same source, reduction must lead to increase, and increase must lead to reduction. The sage’s use of \"orphaned, widowed, and barren\" as self-designations is meant to teach people that aggression invites death. All of this serves as instruction.\n\nThings are not inherently things; firmness is an artificial state. Even the utmost firmness must ultimately return to nothingness. If the softest under heaven can drive and deploy the hardest under heaven, how much more can repeated reduction leading to nothingness shatter the artificiality of being? Thus, nothing can enter where there is no hearing. The action of non-action—its governance is through the Dao. The teaching of non-words—its instruction is through Heaven. No one has ever surpassed this.\n\nYuan’s note: The essence of this chapter, which reveals how weakness serves as the function of the Dao, lies entirely in the phrase \"the penetrating *qi* becomes harmony.\" For there is no penetrating harmony that is not soft and weak. Thus, in life, humans are soft and weak, while in death, they are hard and stiff. When plants are alive, they are soft and weak; when they die, they wither and dry. All perverse and disharmonious *qi* is hard and strong. Therefore, the life of the myriad things must never lose this harmonious *qi* to attain Heaven’s way of life. The opposite is the way of death.\n\nThe previous chapter stated that \"weakness is the function of the Dao\" and expanded on it with \"the myriad things under heaven are born from being; being is born from non-being.\" This chapter directly continues that meaning. Thus, in the text, whenever it speaks of \"those with abundant virtue,\" they are likened to \"the newborn child\"; when it speaks of \"focusing *qi* to utmost softness,\" it must be like \"the infant.\" All of this embodies the principle of valuing weakness as the essence of the Dao. Yet Zhang Erqi suspected missing text, and Yao Nai directly claimed it was a misplaced slip—both failed to grasp the thread of its discourse and the lord of its affairs.",

To seem flawed is not perfection, to seem empty is not fullness, to seem bent is not straightness, to seem clumsy or inarticulate is not skill or eloquence—these are the greatness of perfection, fullness, straightness, skill, and eloquence.

Those who would be lords of all under heaven have much to do, yet those who exhaust themselves in action are less effective than those who practice serene clarity, who act through non-action and accomplish all.

Through non-action, transformation occurs spontaneously; through tranquility, rectification occurs naturally. Thus it is said: those who take the world always do so through non-affair. Those who act ruin it; those who grasp lose it. Thus it is said: engaging in affair is insufficient to take the world.\n\nMaster Wu Cheng says: Following the principle of non-action and nothing left undone, it is said that those who took the world in ancient times did so only through the abundant virtue of non-action, to which people naturally submitted. If one must employ cunning and force, engaging in action, how could this suffice to take the world?\n\nMaster Kumārajīva says: \"Diminish\" means no coarseness is left unabandoned.

      "translated_text": "The term *ting* means to distinguish, to level, to equalize, and to harmonize. As noted in the *Yi* by Master Ma of the *Shi* hexagram.\n\n*Du* means to govern. Thus, giving life and nurturing is like spring; fostering growth and raising is like summer; maturing and governing to bring things to completion is like autumn and winter. Once their momentum is complete, one merely shelters and protects them.\n\nNone of the various commentators have interpreted *ming* as \"enfeoffment.\" Only Master Li has said that the Dao does not intentionally command things, which is a cause for concern in terms of meaning.\n\nMaster Lü Huiqing said: The beginning without name is the Dao. The One that has not yet taken form—what things receive to be born—is virtue. When it becomes a thing, it is merely shaped, not that by which it is born and nurtured. Once it has form, youth, maturity, old age, and death follow inevitably from its momentum. Thus, momentum arises from form, form from virtue, and virtue from the Dao. The Dao and virtue are the root; form and momentum are the branches. The root is honored, the branches humble; the root is noble, the branches base. This is how the soft and weak of non-action overcome the hard and strong of form. And it is in this, not in that, that kings and lords transform the myriad things.\n\nThus, when spoken of separately: the Dao gives life, virtue nurtures; things take form, and momentum completes them. But when traced to their root: giving life, nurturing, fostering, raising, maturing, governing, sheltering, and protecting—none of these are apart from the Dao. Yet the Dao ultimately has no name. Thus, it does not possess, does not rely, does not dominate—this is called profound virtue.\n\nMaster Zhang Erqi said: The form of things is merely the form of what the Dao and virtue give life to and nurture.

      "translated_text": "Wang Bi states:\nThe mother is the root; the child is the branch. By grasping the root, one knows the branch—thus one does not abandon the root to chase the branch. The *dui* is the source from which affairs and desires arise; the gate is the path through which they follow. Without affairs, one remains ever at ease—hence to the end of one’s days, one does not toil. Failing to close the source, one cannot be saved to life’s end.\n\nThe efficacy of governance does not lie in the great. Seeing the great brings no clarity; seeing the small brings clarity. Guarding the strong does not make one strong; guarding the soft makes one strong.\n\nJiao Hong remarks:\n*Dui* is the mouth; the gate is the door of a household—both metaphors for that from which things emerge. To block and close them is to store being within non-being, to guard the mother. Radiance is the function of illumination; illumination is the essence of radiance. *Xi chang* means to inherit illumination, to keep it hidden and unexposed.\n\nZhang Erqi observes:\nThis chapter speaks of embodying the Dao. The beginning and the mother refer to the Dao; the child refers to the myriad things. To know the small and guard the soft is to guard the mother. Small and soft convey the meaning of *xi yi wei*—words that describe the subtlety of the Dao. What is seen yet invisible is the small; to see what is invisible is called clarity. What is guarded yet ungraspable is the soft; to guard what is ungraspable is called strength. Temporarily employing the outwardly manifest radiance, one later withdraws to return to one’s inherent illumination—without straying outward and failing to return, thus bringing no misfortune upon the self. This is to unite with the constant Dao.\n\nLü Huiqing states:\nHearing the Dao is easy; attaining the Dao is difficult. Attaining the Dao is easy; guarding the Dao is difficult. Now that I have grasped the mother and united with the heart-mind, I do not merely hear it—I know that all things under heaven arise from me. If I do not allow things to arise from me but instead guard it without loss, then who in the world could use what arises to harm its very source? This is why one remains unendangered to life’s end.\n\nTo block the *dui* and shut the gate is to guard the mother. When the heart-mind stirs within and one indulges it, this is called having a *dui*. With a *dui*, the heart-mind goes forth to engage with things; blocking it keeps the heart-mind from going forth. When things draw one outward and one accepts them, this is called having a gate. With a gate, things enter to disturb the heart-mind; closing it keeps things from entering. When the inner does not go forth and the outer does not enter, though the myriad things swirl chaotically before one, one remains unaware—how could there be toil?\n\nOnly by guarding the mother does one remain still and unmoving. In this stillness, one constantly perceives the heart-mind in the subtlest stirrings—hence clarity. Seeing it, one constantly guards it, so that with the formless and supremely soft, nothing can overcome it—hence strength. Having employed one’s radiance to perceive the subtlest stirrings, one returns to illumination to revert to stillness. To the end of one’s days, one never opens the *dui* or assists affairs to fall into irredeemable ruin—what misfortune could there be?",

      "translated_text": "The term \"I\" here represents the self of the multitude. *Jieran* (介然) is used in the same sense as in Mencius, where it describes the formation of a path—referring to a fleeting moment. *Shi* (施) is akin to its usage in the *Analects* (\"without *shi* labor\") and in Mencius (\"*shi shi*\"), denoting an external imposition—here, self-aggrandizement and ostentation. The learning of Laozi most abhors exaggeration. This chapter speaks of those who do not know the Dao: by nature, they are bent on self-importance. If, in a sudden moment of insight, they act upon the great Dao, they will inevitably regard *shi* as something to fear and dare not engage in it.\n\nThe Dao is one of humble reticence. Its way is utterly plain and easy, yet people refuse to follow it. Ostentation and self-display are but narrow byways, opposed to the Dao, yet all delight in them. The passage beginning \"when the court is excessively adorned\" describes the affairs of ostentation. Thus it is said: \"ostentatious thievery is no Dao!\"\n\nChen Yidian states: \"To be cautious and dare not act is the great Dao; thus, arrogance and self-display are clearly not the Dao. The Dao of humility is so low that none can surpass it, yet people refuse to follow it. Outwardly, they may dazzle with ornament, but inwardly, they are hollow and empty. Though the court may be splendidly adorned, the fields and granaries are in truth barren and depleted. Still, they don regalia, gird themselves with swords, indulge in lavish feasts, and hoard useless goods, boasting of wealth and strength—like thieves who flaunt their spoils. How far removed are they from the great Dao that fears only *shi*!\"\n\nLü Huiqing says: \"To abandon the Dao and take the byway is to forsake the root and chase the branch. It is like a man who takes food as his foundation, yet food must come from the fields. When fields are well-tended, granaries are full; when granaries are full, food is sufficient; when food is sufficient, wealth abounds; when wealth abounds, the court is well-ordered. Thus one knows the source of the root. Now, if one does not follow the great Dao, failing to grasp the root and merely racing after its branches, how is this different from adorning the court while leaving granaries and fields empty, indulging in fine clothes and excess goods? What distinction remains?\"\n\nLi Jiamo says: \"To walk the great Dao is to be vast and expansive, the heart at ease and daily refreshed—thus, it is utterly level. To contend on narrow paths is to flaunt one’s wit and deceive others, the heart weary and daily diminished—thus, it becomes thievery. The world does not understand this: the court may be meticulously adorned, its outward trappings complete, yet the fields lie fallow and the heart remains untended; the granaries are empty and conduct goes unrefined. They deck themselves in finery to dazzle others, amass excess goods to no purpose—how far have they strayed from the Dao!\n\nYuan’s note: The Dao is greatest when it does not overflow. Not overflowing means focusing inward, having as if not having, being full as if empty. Now, if one engages in *shi* and ostentation, one busies oneself with externals, making nothing into something, emptiness into fullness—endlessly so. Human beings, once born, have desires, and none do not esteem one another as superior. This is the most difficult heart to overcome, with endless harms—is it not deeply to be feared? Yet people find the Dao of non-*shi*, with its restraint and difficulty, hard to follow. Instead, they seek quick gains and swift paths, competing for fleeting advantage. Do they not know that without self-importance or boasting, none can surpass them? The Dao is utterly plain—what difficulty is there in following it?\n\nTo call them 'the people' is to say they are benighted and ignorant, unaware of the great Dao, growing ever more ostentatious and ever smaller. Those who favor the great Dao see vastness; those who favor narrow paths see smallness. Seeing vastness, one is ever as if insufficient; seeing smallness, one is ever as if abundant. Such people, as scholars, will surely chase fame and neglect virtue; as commoners, they will surely indulge in excess and deplete the root; as rulers, they will surely adorn the exterior and hollow the interior. Though their depths and shallows, breadths and narrows differ, their subordination of self to others is one and the same. The most evident of these is the extravagance and decay of the state, easiest to perceive.\n\nHow severe is the difficulty of overcoming the human heart, and how fearsome is *shi*! The passage beginning \"when the court is excessively adorned\" is an extreme admonition to awaken the deluded. It is not merely that *shi* is to be feared in this one regard, nor is it merely a metaphor. Some scholars read *zhi* (知) and *xing* (行) together, or gloss *shi* as 'action,' while the *Hanfeizi* renders it as 'stealing *yu*.' All miss the original intent.\"",

      "translated_text": "Those who establish themselves upon externals—external things may seize and uproot them. Those who cling to externals—external things may seize and strip them away. Those who rely on what is external for their stability will find that such stability cannot ultimately be relied upon. But those who establish virtue and embrace the One—establishing it in the heart, embracing it within—initially bear no form of establishment or embrace. If I do not myself uproot or strip it away, who could uproot or strip it from me? Thus, it is not merely stable for a time, but remains stable for generations to come.\n\nThe way of the world in establishing and embracing is to scheme with cleverness and artifice, borrowing from externals what is not truly their own. The sage, however, cultivates only the virtue of his own person, and what is sufficient within requires no borrowing from without. This is the real. Taking what all people equally possess and preserving it alone—who is not encompassed within what is established and embraced? Extending this to family, state, and world, it is nothing more than the surplus of this virtue, lengthening, enriching, and universalizing it. Beyond this virtue, there is no other matter; beyond this reality, there is no other cultivation.\n\nWhy is it that the body of one person is the body of a family, a village, a state, and the world? The nature and feelings of ten thousand people are the nature and feelings of one body. If the virtue of my own person is cultivated, then observing others through myself, there is no difference between them and me. Thus, though the people of family, state, and world are not one, the body of that family is like the body of this family—observing the people of my own family is sufficient. The body of that state is like the body of this state—observing the people of one state is sufficient. Even the world of today is the world of antiquity, and the world of the future is the world of today. The same body shares the same virtue; the principle of their sameness cannot lie outside this to be known otherwise. It is obtained without going beyond one’s own person.\n\nThe ancients spoke of storing the world within the world—this is the Dao they employed. Thus, to speak of establishment and embrace without cultivation is not true establishment or embrace. To speak of cultivation without the person is not true cultivation. Cultivating it in the person, virtue becomes real. It is perfected therein.\n\nLü Huiqing said: Those in the world who speak of cultivating virtue often cultivate it in family, state, and world, unaware that its true root lies in one’s own person. Once the reality of virtue is cultivated in the person, it is simply extended outward. Zhuang Zhou held that the reality of the Dao is for governing the person, and its surplus is for governing the state; its dregs are for governing the world. This teaching arises from this principle. Observe it in one’s own person—what is surplus is already sufficient and requires nothing from without. Thus, observing family, state, and world is no different.",

Thus, many prohibitions arise, seeking to shame the people, yet the people grow only poorer. Sharp instruments seek to strengthen the state, yet the state grows only more benighted. When the people abound in cleverness, artifice arises; when artifice arises, perverse affairs emerge, until laws and decrees proliferate and thieves and bandits multiply. All this comes from abandoning the root to govern the branches.\n\nThus, uprightness seeks to still perversity, yet stratagem and warfare are employed. The sage practices non-action and absence of desire, and the people swiftly follow. All this means honoring the root to still the branches.\n\nWho knows their ultimate end—this absence of standard? It means: who can know the utmost of good governance? Only when nothing can be set right, nothing can be named, and the world is transformed in profound obscurity—this is its utmost.\n\nGoverning the state with uprightness thus readily reverts to the use of stratagem and warfare. This is establishing goodness to order things, yet it brings the calamity of perversity. For people’s delusion and loss of the Dao have endured long indeed; one cannot simply govern them with uprightness and demand compliance.\n\nTherefore, the sage guides things with squareness, letting them abandon their perversity, yet does not cut with squareness. He purifies the people with integrity, letting them abandon their corruption, yet does not wound with integrity. He guides things with straightness, letting them abandon their deviance, yet does not provoke them with straightness. He illuminates their delusions with radiance, yet does not expose their hidden faults with radiance.\n\nThis is what is meant by: \"Great square has no corners; great straightness seems bent; the luminous Dao seems dim.\" All this means honoring the root to still the branches, not attacking but restoring them.\n\n---\n\nMaster Wu Cheng states:\nGoverning the state with uprightness means using laws, regulations, and prohibitions to correct what is not upright—this is the way of Guanzi and Shang Yang. Using stratagem in warfare means employing deception rather than uprightness—this is the way of Sunzi and Wuzi.\n\nStratagem can only be used in warfare but cannot govern the state. Uprightness can only govern the state but cannot take the world. Only by governing the world with non-action does one not seek to subdue others, yet others naturally follow without exception.\n\nWhat, then, is the effect of governing the state with uprightness?",

      "translated_text": "What is called misfortune may not ultimately be misfortune, and what is called fortune may not ultimately be fortune. Who can know where their ultimate ends lie? For uprightness and its opposite stand in contrast: when uprightness reverses, it becomes the perverse oddity of non-uprightness. Uprightness is deemed good, while oddity is deemed ill—thus calamity arises. Yet if there were no such thing as \"upright,\" there would be no such thing as \"good,\" nor would it reverse into the perverse oddity of calamity. Ordinary people, long deluded, have forgotten this principle. Thus they know only that governing through uprightness is good, unaware that what is called \"upright\" is no uprightness at all. Who but those who embody the Dao can understand this?\n\nThose who embody the Dao take \"no affair\" as their affair. Thus they take formlessness as form, unscrupulousness as scrupulousness, crookedness as straightness, and dullness as brilliance. In their encounters with things, their edges and sharp corners are concealed, their brilliance hidden and veiled. They move without harming others, possessing the benefits of goodness without its flaws. Though they never seek to take the world, the principle by which the world may be taken lies within them.\n\nMaster Lü’s disciple Huìqīng said: \"Governing a state with cleverness is the state’s ruin; governing without cleverness is the state’s blessing.\" Thus it is clear that \"having affairs\" is insufficient to take the world. How do we know that \"no affair\" suffices to take the world? We know it precisely because \"having affairs\" is insufficient.\n\nWhen rulers deem themselves upright, the people grow poorer, the state more muddled, and customs more extravagant—this is why laws and decrees proliferate and bandits multiply. All these are the faults of taking the world through \"having affairs.\" But when the sage practices non-action, the people transform themselves, free from the harm of taboos. When the ruler favors tranquility, the people naturally become upright, free from the harm of laws and bandits. When the ruler has no affairs, the people naturally grow rich, free from the confusion of sharp implements. When the ruler has no desires, the people naturally return to simplicity, free from the pursuit of cunning and perversity.\n\nThus, in taking the world through \"no affair,\" governance is dull and unremarkable, not delighting in sharp discernment. The people, too, remain simple and uncorrupted by shallowness. But in governing with cleverness and taking the world through \"having affairs,\" governance becomes sharply discerning, the opposite of dullness. Thus the people become fragmented and fail to preserve their simplicity. Sharp discernment and fragmentation mean fleeing misfortune without certainty of escape, seeking fortune without certainty of attainment. What is deemed upright and good may at times become perverse and calamitous. Misfortune and fortune, perversity and uprightness, good and ill—who can truly know where they reside? All that results is an excess of cleverness, making governance difficult.\n\nSince people first gained knowledge, they have long been deluded and obstinate. How can they be further burdened with sharply discerning governance, preventing them from returning to simplicity and preserving their nature?

      "translated_text": "The study of Laozi is characterized by humility, modesty, frugality, and thrift—utterly unwilling to expend one's spirit. \"Early compliance is called the repeated accumulation of virtue\" means that one has already accumulated something early on, and by further nurturing it with thrift, one adds to this accumulation. If one waits until depletion has already occurred before nurturing, then nurturing merely suffices to replenish what was lost, and cannot be called \"repeated accumulation.\" The value of early compliance lies in early awareness of what has not yet been depleted, and conserving it.\n\nYao Nai said: \"Compliance (*fu*) means affairs. Thrift means having leisure in time and surplus in strength, thus enabling one to engage with affairs before they arise, accumulating virtue in advance. By the time affairs arrive, there is nothing one cannot overcome.\" Li Jiamo said: \"Externally in governing people and internally in serving Heaven, nothing surpasses thrift. Thrift means being thrifty in all things. Be vigilant within and composed without; the inner mind does not wander, and outer desires do not stir. Thus one can attain early compliance, and virtue accumulates day by day. Accumulating what is not seen as accumulation leads to overcoming all; overcoming all leads to governing all. Even possessing the state is possible. People know that one possesses the state but do not know that one can possess the state because of its root. When the root's accumulation is deep, who can fathom its limits? This is why it endures long and is not imperiled.\"\n\nLü Huiqing said: \"Human life is inherently sufficient in virtue. If one truly practices thrift and attains early compliance, then virtue daily fills to abundance—what is this if not the repeated accumulation of virtue? When virtue reaches its utmost, nothing can harm it; nothing under Heaven can overcome it. Where then is there anything one cannot conquer? With nothing unconquerable and none able to fathom one's limits, one becomes the master of things without being mastered by them. How could one not possess the state? Having attained the mother, one knows the child; knowing the child, one again guards the mother. Thus one remains unharmed throughout life and may endure long. Spirit is the root and foundation of life. By conserving and storing it, protecting and preserving it, the root and foundation grow deep and firm, and life flourishes. With flourishing life, one's vision endures long.\"\n\nSu Zhe said: \"All things, when square, cut; when sharp, wound; when straight, extend wantonly; when bright, dazzle. The sage possesses abilities but does not exhaust their use—thrift means having yet not using. By restraining and concealing one's capacities, even unto death without ever employing them, virtue is repeatedly accumulated. When virtue's accumulation is deep, even the world's hardness and strength cannot overcome it, and things cannot gauge one's measure. Only then can one possess the state, for one is able to guard the mother. Mencius said: 'Preserve one's mind and nourish one's nature—this is how one serves Heaven.' Thus, using thrift to govern people enables one to possess the state, while using thrift to serve Heaven means deep roots and firm foundations. The utmost persons of antiquity preserved the constancy of their nature and life, not depleting the inner through the outer. Thus their roots grew deep and unshakable, their foundations firm and inseparable. Even long life and enduring vision are possible.\"\n\nYuan's note: Many interpretations of this chapter are discordant. Only Su Shi's division—taking \"one may possess the state\" and above as governing people, and \"deep roots and firm foundations\" as serving Heaven—is more satisfying in meaning. Laozi's book, in its highest sense, can elucidate the Dao; in its middle sense, can cultivate the self; and extended, can govern others. Its words are always applicable to these three. This chapter begins with \"in governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality\" as its core, and the subsequent text elaborates on thrift in repeated detail. From \"early compliance is called the repeated accumulation of virtue\" to \"none can fathom one's limits,\" all expound the meaning of thrift, encompassing both governing people and serving Heaven. It then cites possessing the state to illustrate the application of governing people, and touches on deep roots and firm foundations to address the essentials of serving Heaven. For the Dao's thrift, when taken to the point of early compliance without interruption, and virtue's accumulation, when taken to the point where none can fathom its limits, then contraction and expansion are both fitting, and essence and function are both wondrous. With this, possessing the state enables long endurance, and firming the self enables long life. Only because governing people and serving Heaven are both possible does it say \"nothing surpasses frugality.\" However, Su Shi's explanation of early compliance as \"complying with others\" and Wu's interpretation of possessing the state as an analogy for preserving this body are both partial in meaning and not worth adopting.",

Thus, managing great multitudes and frequently disturbing them yields little success. Storing great vessels and frequently moving them results in much damage. Cooking a small fish and frequently stirring it spoils its sheen. Governing a great state and frequently changing laws makes the people suffer. Therefore, a ruler who embodies the Dao values tranquility and weighs the gravity of altering laws.\n\nWhen people are afflicted by illness, they esteem physicians; when misfortune strikes, they fear ghosts. But when a sage rules from above, the people have few desires. With few desires, their blood and qi are regulated, and their actions are orderly. Orderly actions lead to fewer calamities. Those free from internal ailments and external punishments or legal executions hold ghosts in great disdain. Thus it is said: 'Those who oversee the world with the Dao—their ghosts do not act as spirits.' This means that in a well-governed age, ghosts and spirits do not harm people.\n\nCalling a sick person 'harmed by ghosts' is one thing; when the ruler executes the people, that is the ruler harming them. When the people do not violate the law and the ruler does not impose punishments, that is the ruler not harming the people. Hence it is said: 'The sage also does no harm to the people.'\n\nWhen the ruler does not harm the people and ghosts do not harm people, this is the two not harming one another. Then virtue resides entirely in the people. Thus it is said: 'Virtue and power converge and return.' This means that virtue—whether hidden or manifest, above or below—flourishes and returns wholly to the people.\"]\n\nWang Bi comments:\n\"Agitation brings much harm; stillness preserves authenticity. Thus, the greater the state, the more tranquil its ruler must be—only then can he broadly win the hearts of the people. It is like cooking a small fish: do not disturb it. When things abide by their nature, spirits have no influence. With no influence from spirits, one does not perceive their numinous power. When the Dao governs, the sage does no harm to people. When the sage does no harm, one does not perceive his sagacity. Relying on coercive nets to govern things marks the decline of governance. To make people unaware of the numinous and sagely as such is the ultimate realization of the Dao. When the numinous and the sagely do not harm one another, they unite with the Dao and return together to the people.\"]\n\nChapter Fifty-Two.",

      "translated_text": "The great state, though not inherently beneath others, can place itself below them—just as the rivers and seas, by virtue of their lowliness, become the confluence of all waters. The small state, though naturally in a lower position, can likewise place itself below others—just as the female, without initiating movement to seek the male, achieves through the stillness of her lowly stance the male’s active pursuit from above. Thus, the following passage immediately takes up these two analogies and addresses them separately: when the great state does not rely on its loftiness, the small state delights in allegiance; when the small state can rest content in its humility, it wins the favor of the great state. This is how the great state, through humble deference, secures the small state’s attachment, and how the small state, through submission, gains the great state’s acceptance.\n\nYet the small, being naturally beneath others, need not fear inability to humble itself; thus the closing line focuses solely on the greater: *the greater must humble itself.* Yuan’s note observes that the chapter’s opening speaks only of the great state as the world’s confluence, not of the small state as the world’s female—this is because the female’s smallness requires no mention, while the great, not yet knowing to emulate water’s lowliness, is addressed throughout.\n\nEach person has desires yet does not know the Way by which to fulfill them. The great state’s desire is no more than to nurture and shelter others; the small state’s desire is no more than to be accepted by others. This is the common sentiment of all under heaven, yet now both attain their desires through humility—so profound is the efficacy of *below.* Thus, among all things under heaven, even the greatest must humble itself.\n\nLin Xiyi remarks: The full weight of this chapter rests upon its closing line. For whether nurturing and sheltering others or serving and joining them, neither can be achieved without self-lowering. Only through self-lowering can both attain what they desire. Therefore, those who know the Way invariably regard humility as proper. The meaning is this: the strong must be able to be weak; the possessing must be able to be without—only then do they know the Way. This principle recurs throughout the text, yet commentators often mistake the analogies for literal meaning.

Those who possess the Dao are appointed to the positions of ruler and teacher, becoming the Son of Heaven or the Three Dukes, all because the Dao is esteemed. In court visits and diplomatic audiences, four-horse carriages are arrayed in the courtyard, and the envoy first presents a large jade disc to convey the mandate—such rites are weighty indeed. Yet even these do not compare to the value of kneeling to offer this Dao.\n\nLi Jiamo remarks: The worthy treasure the Dao, thus they rejoice in attaining what they seek. The unworthy have no refuge but the Dao, thus they rejoice in having their sins remitted. Since this arises from the natural root of the human heart, with no external compulsion, when words and deeds accord with the Dao, their beauty may be traded in the marketplace, and their honor may be bestowed upon others. If this were not the natural inclination of the human heart, words would go unheeded, and deeds would meet no response—how could they achieve such effect? Because each person is rooted in the Dao, even if one unfortunately falls into unworthiness, how could the sage bear to abandon them? Thus, the Son of Heaven is established, and the Three Dukes are appointed—not to bestow mere wealth and nobility, but to prevent people from being irrevocably lost in unworthiness, guiding them back to goodness through this Dao.\n\nLü Huiqing says: In the generation of the myriad things, not a single being lacks this Dao. Only the good know from whence their blessings arise, thus they attain it and gain boundless abundance. The unworthy, recognizing their own unworthiness, may yet have their myriad transgressions dissolved in an instant. If fair words can be traded and noble conduct bestowed, then people—whether good or not—naturally know what is beautiful and what is honorable. How much more is the Dao to humanity like heaven and earth, which cover and bear all without exception? It is not merely a matter of being traded or bestowed.

Following the discussion of \"no affairs\" and \"no flavor,\" it proceeds to address great and small, many and few, and repaying enmity with virtue—demonstrating that the sage’s non-action is not mere empty negation or idle talk, but truly capable of viewing great and small as equal, transforming enmity into virtue, and accepting all difficult emotions with equanimity. Only then can one verify the practice of \"affairs without affairs\" and \"flavor without flavor.\" After explaining action before things arise and governance before disorder begins, it further elaborates on non-action and non-grasping, clarifying that the sage’s \"action\" is not about meticulous caution or clever vigilance. His non-action and non-grasping arise from what others do not perceive, without contrivance or intention. When flavor is without flavor, his desires become \"desires without desire.\" When affairs are without affairs, his learning becomes \"learning without learning.\" To \"rely\" is to await—awaiting the spontaneous self-so of things without daring to impose action. This is what is meant by \"non-action naturally transforming\" and \"tranquility naturally rectifying.\")*\n\nWu Cheng said: \"The fundamental tenet of Laozi is to act through non-action. 'No affairs' and 'no flavor' both expound this principle. The reason one can achieve non-action is by addressing difficulties when they are easy and undertaking greatness when it is small. Worldly affairs begin as easy but end as difficult, begin as small but end as great. Thus, if one plans and acts at the outset, effort is spared, and non-action is naturally attained. If one does not act early but hastily intervenes, the easy gradually becomes difficult, the small gradually becomes great, and both mind and strength are exhausted—how can non-action then be possible? The sage never strives for greatness and thus accomplishes greatness, continuing the discussion of the great and small of affairs to address the great and small of the mind. When things are small, the mind does not dare to regard itself as great; even when things become great, the mind remains unchanged. By being small from beginning to end, it can accomplish greatness. The four phrases—'light promises seldom trusted, many things treated as easy encounter many difficulties'—continue the discussion of the difficulty and ease of affairs to address the difficulty and ease of the mind. What begins as easy will inevitably end as difficult. Thus, though the sage faces ease at the outset, his mind remains cautious. By never treating things as easy from beginning to end, he ultimately encounters no difficulty. The six phrases beginning with 'what is secure is easily maintained' speak of planning when things are easy. The three phrases—'a tree as large as a man’s embrace grows from a tiny sprout, a nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth, a journey of a thousand *li* begins with a single step'—speak of acting when things are small. The four phrases about the people engaging in affairs further develop the ideas of 'ultimately encountering no difficulty' and 'never striving for greatness.' Though one may begin by treating things as difficult and not daring to regard them as great, if by the end one becomes complacent and self-important, affairs may nearly succeed yet fail in the end. Therefore, one must be as cautious at the end as at the beginning to ensure no ultimate failure. The chapter begins with 'practicing non-action' and concludes with 'relying on the spontaneous self-so without daring to act,' thus bringing the chapter’s meaning full circle.\"\n\nWang Dao said: \"All people have something they act upon; the sage is also human—how could he alone have nothing to act upon? The difference is that what the multitude acts upon are affairs of action, while what the sage acts upon is the Dao of non-action. 'Affairs' are the conditions of action; 'flavor' is the principle and essence of action.\"\n\nLiu Gai said: \"Desiring what others do not desire is called 'desiring without desire.' Not desiring what others desire is called 'not prizing rare and hard-to-obtain goods.' Learning what others do not learn is called 'learning without learning.' Not learning what others learn is called 'restoring what the multitude has passed over.'\"\n\nWang Pang said: \"Relying on the spontaneous self-so of the myriad things without daring to act allows each to rest in the constancy of its nature, so that affairs and things show no signs. How then could anything be fragile enough to dissolve or minute enough to scatter?\"\n\nSu Zhe said: \"The world fears the great and disdains the small, fears the difficult and treats the easy lightly. If one waits until things are difficult before planning or great before acting, affairs will seldom succeed. The sage equalizes great and small, unifies many and few, fears nothing, and treats nothing lightly—how could he not succeed? When things have not yet arisen, holding and planning them is sufficient. When they are about to manifest, they cannot be dissolved or scattered. Thus, acting before things arise is best; governing before disorder begins is next. The sage awaits them with non-action and holds them with non-grasping, enabling blessings to arise naturally and calamities to vanish on their own. For example, when planting seedlings, deep plowing and thorough weeding ensure a bountiful autumn harvest. When confronted by thieves, sitting upright and observing intently will make them retreat on their own. The world does not understand the spontaneity of things, believing that nothing is accomplished without action and nothing retained without grasping. Thus, they constantly contend with calamity and burden themselves with blessings. Even when affairs are still minute, there may be those who do not yet understand and allow them to unfold naturally.

      "translated_text": "The sage knows the harm of forced action and does not rely on human effort to assist Heaven. From beginning to end, all follows its natural course, and thus there is nothing that does not succeed. Lü Huìqīng said: \"Forced action entails affairs; affairs entail complications. To act without acting is to make affairs no-affairs. Though one may ponder this repeatedly, what complication could remain?\" What people find hardest to forget is resentment, yet if I repay it solely with virtue, what else could trouble my heart?\n\nThe affairs of the world begin in the minute and arise from the easy. If there is anything to be done, I must first perceive it in the easy and the minute. Once perceived, I act upon the image—this is what is called \"knowing the subtle and attaining the spirit.\" Thus, one never acts upon the great, and so can accomplish the great. For while others guard against the great in the minute, how could they ever act upon the great in the great? Even the sage finds this difficult, and so ultimately encounters no difficulty—by making the difficult easy before it becomes difficult.\n\nHold fast to tranquility; plan before signs appear—this is acting upon what has not yet arisen. Break what is fragile; scatter what is minute—this is governing before disorder arises. If one acts only after something has arisen, the desire for success will instead bring failure. If one governs only after disorder has set in, grasping will only grow firmer and lead to greater loss. The sage acts by non-action, and so there is no action; governs by non-governing, and so there is no grasping. The people’s undertakings always begin after something has already arisen, and so they reach near-completion only to ruin them—because they do not know the root.\n\nIf one knows that the great arises from the small, the high from the low, the distant from the near, and acts with caution, what failure or loss could there be? Master Li Jiāmó said: \"Proceeding from the easy, even the difficult becomes easy. Advancing from the minute, even the great becomes minute. Thus, the sage never acts upon the great, yet the great inevitably returns to him—because he is without intention. The sage, before affairs arise, always treats them as if they were difficult, not presuming that things must conform to me. Thus, he constantly abides in what is secure, and nothing is insecure. Then his holding is no-holding, and so is easily held. Even if the slightest sign of insecurity stirs, he plans against it before it takes shape and breaks or scatters it while it is still fragile and minute. Thus, nothing disturbs his security—by holding to security before it is lost and governing insecurity before it arises.\n\nIt is like a tree growing on its own, earth gradually rising, or a journey extending day by day. Within non-action, action arises naturally; within non-accumulation, accumulation occurs naturally. Thus, day by day, burdens fall away, and goodness accumulates day by day—yet the sage remains unaware. The reason the world’s pursuit of the Dao is so difficult to complete and easy to ruin lies in its intentionality—its grasping and forcing. At first, it seems as though no effort is spared, yet in the end, one cannot escape negligence. All this is the fault of forcing and grasping. If one neither forces nor grasps from beginning to end, one could not even find negligence, let alone indulge in it.\n\nJiao Hong said: \"Non-action, no-affairs, no-complications—this is the Dao. This Dao cannot be attained by force; it is supremely easy. It cannot be glimpsed by the eye; it is supremely minute. Though supremely easy, the supremely difficult depends on it for resolution. Though supremely minute, the supremely great depends on it for completion. How could one neglect it for its ease and minuteness? Some who study the Dao may glimpse this truth, yet their minds are seized by the desire for greatness, and so the easy and the minute do not long remain theirs. Only the sage, from beginning to end, acts by non-action, engages in no-affairs, and savors no-complications—without allowing the world’s notion of greatness to divide his mind. Thus, when encountering the difficult and the great, he meets them with stillness, leaving no trace of obstruction, and the Dao is thereby preserved whole. This is what is called 'accomplishing the great.'\n\nAlas! This is not something those of weak resolve, who see principles dimly and waver in their purpose, could ever perceive, uphold, or discuss with those who make light promises and treat matters carelessly.\"} Chapter Fifty-Five}",

      "translated_text": "Chapter Fifty-Six\n\nThe reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys is that they excel at being lowly. Thus they become kings of the hundred valleys. Therefore, if one wishes to be above the people, one must speak to them from below. If one wishes to lead the people, one must place oneself behind them. Thus the sage, though above, does not burden the people; though ahead, does not harm them. Therefore the world delights in exalting him and never wearies of it. Because he does not contend, no one in the world can contend with him.\n\nThe world all says: \"My Dao is great yet seems unworthy.\" {Fu Yi’s version reads \"I\" instead of \"my,\" and omits \"Dao.\"} Precisely because it is great, it seems unworthy. If it were worthy, it would long since have been petty. {One version omits \"also\" and \"indeed.\" ○ This chapter’s wording follows Wang Bi’s edition. Other versions place \"the sage\" before \"if one wishes to be above the people,\" which introduces linguistic flaws in discussing the sage. Some read \"by speaking to them from below\" and \"by placing oneself behind them,\" following the syntax of the earlier phrase \"by excelling at being lowly.\" Others change all four instances of \"people\" to \"men,\" reducing it to a comparison between things rather than the fixed relationship between ruler and people. Still others read \"though ahead, men cannot harm him,\" which redundantly echoes the later phrase \"no one can contend with him.\" These two lines appear in Fu Yi’s version as \"abides above, abides ahead,\" while the *Heshang Gong* version reads \"abides above the people, abides ahead of the people\"—both inferior to Wang Bi’s harmonious phrasing.}\n\n{Only by being lowly does one become great—this is the core tenet of the Old Master. To be called \"king\" means all under heaven turn toward and submit. To be called \"sea\" means all streams gather and converge. People know the king is most exalted, yet do not grasp why he is exalted. It is because he is supremely great. And why can he achieve such greatness? Because he can be lowly and contain all things. \"If you do not boast, no one in the world will contend with you in ability. If you do not claim merit, no one in the world will contend with you in achievement.\" Let the world forget who is above and who is ahead, and instead vie to exalt him, to place him above and ahead. Such a Dao may truly be called great. Yet the world instead says it does not resemble ordinary sentiment. But greatness does not resemble; resemblance is not greatness. If rivers and seas vied with the hundred streams, how could they remain rivers and seas? If the king’s Dao resembled any single thing, how could he be king of all under heaven? The previous chapter spoke of being contrary to things as the way to accord with them. This chapter speaks of not resembling the common as the way to be great. The meaning is one and the same. The *Inscription on the Golden Man* says: \"The noble person knows one cannot be above all under heaven, so he lowers himself. Knowing one cannot be ahead of others, he places himself behind.\" Yang Xiong said: \"Those who humble themselves are exalted by others. Those who place themselves behind are put ahead by others.\" Dong Sijing said: \"Lower your virtue, and your position will rise. Place yourself behind, and you will be first.\" Su Ziyou said: \"Those with the Dao never seek to be above or ahead of others. But once they lower and place themselves behind, their Dao cannot but rise and lead.\" All have grasped the Old Master’s intent. ○ Lü Huiqing said: \"Those who possess all under heaven, in terms of position, are certainly above others. Yet they style themselves 'orphaned, widowed, and lacking,' and accept the world’s disgrace and misfortune—how lowly their words! In terms of precedence, they are certainly ahead of others. Yet they act only under compulsion, respond only when moved, and rise only when unavoidable—how they place themselves behind! Thus, though above, people find bearing them light. Though ahead, people find following them beneficial. Above and below forget one another, and so the world delights in exalting them without tiring. For what they take is not what the people contend for. Through non-action, the world does not even perceive their presence, so how can they be called unworthy? And who could contend with them?\"} Chapter Fifty-Seven",

find no obstruction is difficult.\nTherefore, of these three, he first advances compassion,\nAnd further elaborates it to show that in attack, it brings victory,\nIn defense, it brings firmness—\nThis is what is most urgent today.\nIf Heaven would save these people,\nIt must cause one who acts with compassion to emerge and guard them.\nIs this not what Laozi deeply expects of the world?\n\nJiao Hong said:\nNot martial, not enraged,\nYet it is said to match Heaven, the ancient utmost—why?\nBecause the extreme of contention is warfare,\nSo he borrows this to illustrate the virtue of non-contention.\nThere is a saying in the use of arms—\nThis is an ancient saying of military strategists.\n*Reng* is the same as *reng*.\nThe *Book of Songs* says, \"still grasping the captive foe.\"\n\nWang Bi said:\nThe officer is the leader of the soldiers.\n\"Not martial, not enraged\" means acting later, not first,\nResponding, not initiating.\n\"Not contending\" means not contending with others.\nIf one employs others without placing oneself below,\nThey will not give their full strength.\nTo say that with sorrow, compassion, and humility,\nOne employs them in war—\nEven without ranks,\nWithout raising arms,\nWithout weapons,\nThe enemy will have no one to resist.\nYet though I am sorrowful, compassionate, and humble,\nI do not seek to become invincible under Heaven.\nOnly when forced to the point of invincibility\nDoes this become my greatest misfortune—\nNearly losing my treasures.\n(He refers to the Three Treasures.)\nWhen opposing forces meet,\nThe grieving one will surely pity and not seek profit or avoid harm,\nThus they must prevail.\n\nYuan’s note:\nArmies rely on fighting to the death to resist the enemy,\nHence there are ranks, raised arms, and weapons.\nBut if there is no enemy to repel,\nThen there are no ranks to arrange, no arms to raise, no weapons to grasp.\nFor to make the latter one’s priority,\nTo make retreat one’s advance,\nAlways to make others come to you rather than going to them—\nThis is to hold the art of complete victory,\nTo achieve it without labor, sitting and attaining it.\nThis is called repelling without an enemy.\nYet though this is called having no enemy,\nIs this truly what I delight in?\nFor when arms reach the point of invincibility under Heaven,\nThe slaughter must be great—\nNo misfortune is greater.\nThe former troops turned their weapons back,\nBlood flowed, floating the pestles—\nEven the armies of kings,\nThe gentleman cannot bear to speak of it.\nIs this not what is meant by nearly losing my treasures?\nThus when I use arms,\nI do so only when forced,\nRegard them as inauspicious,\nAnd conduct myself as in mourning—\nThis is the utmost of sorrow.\nOnly with sorrow can one speak of victory.\nThis is what is meant by \"with compassion, one prevails in attack and stands firm in defense;\nHeaven will save them, guarding them with compassion.\"\n\nAll editions read: \"No misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy;\nUnderestimating the enemy nearly loses my treasures.\"\nBut to underestimate the enemy is to court defeat;\nIf one’s own life is not preserved,\nHow can one speak of nearly losing treasures?\nThis is merely Sun Wu’s art of victory,\nNot the teaching of the supreme compassion and sorrow.\n\nSu Zhe said:\nBoldness, expansion, and taking the lead—\nThese three are what people universally detest.\nThose who are detested by the multitude\nOften draw near to death.\nBut to guard things with compassion\nIs to make them love you like parents;\nThough they die for you, they will not refuse.\nThus one can attack and defend.\nIf Heaven would save these people,\nIt opens their hearts and minds,\nSo that there is nothing they do not cherish.\nWhen nothing is not cherished,\nAll things become their guard.\nThus when two enemies meet,\nAnd I act only when forced,\nThen I have a sorrowful heart.\nWhen the sorrowful heart appears,\nHeaven and man assist it—\nEven if one wished not to prevail, it would be impossible.\n\nLü Huiqing said:\nThe so-called Three Treasures\nAre all difficult for people to uphold.\nOnly one who is without self and does not contend can uphold them.\nYet only through compassion can one be frugal;\nOnly through frugality does one dare not take the lead under Heaven.\nThus compassion is the source of the Three Treasures.\nThe movement of the Dao is always under compulsion,\nYet its application always lies in non-contention.\nWhen applied to the use of arms,\nIt seems as if it cannot be put into practice.\nYet one who acts as host is contrary, while the guest is compliant;\nThe host is wearied, while the guest is at ease;\nAdvancing is arrogant, while retreating is humble;\nAdvancing is restless, while retreating is calm.\nTo await the contrary with compliance,\nThe wearied with ease,\nThe arrogant with humility,\nThe restless with calm—\nNone can match this.\nThus the constancy

      "translated_text": "The teaching of Laozi is simply to be yielding, weak, humble, and lowly—nothing more. His words are most simple and easy, yet as the world declines and customs degrade, none under Heaven recognize their value or practice them. Why is this? Because the matters of yielding, weakness, and humility that I speak of inherently contain a unifying principle and governing essence. The world does not know this essence of mine; they see only the outward words, which appear as nothing more than yielding, humility, and lowliness. Thus they regard them as base and unworthy of esteem, failing to treasure them. Hence my deep lament.\n\nFor the great Dao is at odds with the vulgar and unworthy, and its profound virtue runs counter to worldly things. Those who truly know it are naturally few—this is why the Dao is precious in the eyes of the world and cannot be ignored. If the Dao were no different from common sentiments and ordinary views, it would be unworthy of reverence. Since people do not know it, I possess three treasures, which only I can uphold and practice—like one who wears coarse cloth while holding jade, unknown to others.\n\nWhat is treasured within is the understanding of the source of words and the lord of affairs. What is outwardly worn as lowly is the knowing that does not appear as knowing—like one who seems foolish and obscure. This is the highest virtue, which appears as disgrace. Since people do not know, they inevitably turn and claim to know, displaying their jade to seek buyers. But what they offer cannot be the true treasure. They mistake flaw for beauty, take the compass for a mere ornament. Even if a sage dwells among them, they cannot be cured or saved. What is this if not a flaw?\n\nIf one day they recognize their flaw and regard it as a flaw, then the means to dispel it lies precisely here. The first half speaks of the difficulty of those who know the Dao, while the latter half laments the multitude who falsely claim to know. Those who are ignorant of the true Dao are deluded by vulgar views. In terms of the human condition, not knowing is the symptom of the flaw, while mistaking one’s false views for knowledge is its root cause. Thus the latter part uses the metaphor of illness.",

      "translated_text": "The *Heshang Gong* edition divides this into two chapters, and later commentators have followed suit. Upon examination, the passage beginning with \"knowing yet not-knowing\" fully develops the meaning of the first half. Had the latter half not clearly pointed this out, the notion of \"knowing rarity values me\" would risk becoming flawed.\n\nThe people do not fear authority—\nthen great authority arrives.\n\nDo not constrict their dwelling.\nDo not stifle what gives them life.\nOnly by not stifling\nis there no stifling.\n\nThus the sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nloves himself but does not exalt himself.\nTherefore, he discards that and adopts this.\n\n---\n\nJiao Hong notes: *Wei* (威, authority) and *wei* (畏, fear) were interchangeable in ancient usage. When people do not fear what they ought to fear, what is truly fearsome will come. The following lines all speak of fearing what ought to be feared.\n\nLü Huiqing says: When the people are not wholly aligned with the Dao but instead esteem knowledge, their lives become excessive. Excessive living leads to disregard for death, and disregard for death leads to defiance of authority. When the people reach the point of defying authority, there is nothing they will not do—this is how Heaven manifests its authority and metes out its great punishment.\n\nLi Jiamo says: The one who knows the Dao meets things as they come and rests content. Thus, he does not grow weary of his dwelling nor stifle what gives him life. Only by not stifling himself does nothing else stifle him. This arises from knowing himself without parading his knowledge, loving himself without exalting his love. If he harbored the intent to display or exalt himself, he would inevitably constrict his dwelling and stifle his life, unable to find peace even for a day.\n\nChen Yidian says: The world contains a path that leads to death by fleeing life—this is the great authority. Not fearing it means entering into fear. Thus, one must not dare to constrict the dwelling of the self with excessive desires, nor grow weary of what sustains life by neglecting one’s duties. Only by dwelling in contentment and not stifling life does one secure the self and not grow weary of the Dao. \"Knowing oneself but not displaying oneself\" means examining and fulfilling one’s duties without boasting of one’s possessions. Knowing oneself means knowing what to love; not displaying oneself means having nothing to pride oneself on. Thus, he discards the constricted and stifled in favor of what brings peace.\n\nThe *Laozi* largely warns against boasting and external craving.\n\nYuan’s note: When people do not know the fearfulness of authority, it is due to their covetous desires. External covetousness arises from internal weariness. \"Dwelling\" refers to circumstances like poverty, wealth, honor, lowliness, success, or failure. \"What gives life\" refers to the body’s experiences, such as toil, ease, glory, disgrace, suffering, or joy. People regard their life and dwelling as inferior to others’ and feel shame. Thus, dwelling in poverty rather than wealth is constricting; dwelling in lowliness rather than honor is constricting; dwelling in obscurity rather than fame and renown is constricting. Constriction breeds weariness, and weariness breeds envy. Weariness of toil leads to longing for ease; weariness of disgrace leads to craving for glory; weariness of suffering leads to yearning for joy. When the flame of envy burns brightly, the great authority they ought to fear follows closely behind. For those who fret over gain and loss, there is no limit to their excesses—those who seek glory bring about disgrace, and those who seek life invite death. Self-weariness leads to weariness from Heaven and others. But if one does not constrict, one does not grow weary. If I do not weary of myself, who can weary of me?\n\nThough the people and the sage differ vastly in stature, their principles are not distinct. Constricting one’s dwelling inevitably leads to self-aggrandizement. The sage rests content wherever he is, taking self-knowledge as sufficient and never hastening to display himself to boast of his greatness. Those who stifle what gives them life inevitably seek to exalt their lives. The sage treasures authenticity and embraces simplicity, valuing freedom from danger and disgrace as self-love, never seeking external exaltation to enrich his life. Thus, having nothing to envy means having nothing to weary of, and having nothing to weary of means having nothing to fear. What is absent is what is discarded; what is present is what is adopted.\n\nMany commentators on this passage lean toward Chan Buddhism. Wu Cheng’s emendation of \"not stifling\" to \"not growing weary\" is clear and incisive, yet it does not cohere with the lines \"the sage knows himself but does not display himself.\" Both miss the original intent.",

When all seek to indulge their lives but cannot, how can they not treat death lightly? Thus, the people’s disregard for life arises from their superiors’ lavish pursuit of it.

Therefore, it is illustrated through the tangible: the forms of people and plants alike die through rigidity and strength, and live through suppleness and weakness. How, then, could one who seeks to embody the formless Dao not attain suppleness and weakness? This is the principle that suppleness and weakness overcome rigidity and strength—not merely that armies grow arrogant and are defeated, or that strong trees are felled. Heaven, with its clarity and emptiness, resides above; earth, with its solidity and density, lies below. Ministers serve their superiors through action; rulers govern their subjects through non-action. The principle holds true for all things. Thus, the value of embodying the Dao through suppleness is evident.\"\n\nSu Zhe says: \"Where the harmonizing qi abides, the body is free from the affliction of rigidity and strength. Where the ultimate principle resides, affairs are free from the burden of rigidity and strength. The constant principle of things is that the refined dwells above, while the coarse dwells below. The refined must be supple and weak, while the coarse must be strong and great.\"\n\nWu Cheng says: \"The final two lines follow directly from the preceding two. For armies that are strong are overcome by others, which is not as advantageous as those who overcome through weakness and thus dwell above others. The trunk of a strong tree is near the roots, which is not as advantageous as the branches that dwell above. Extending this principle, one knows that those who pride themselves and domineer others will surely stumble, while those who value humility and suppleness are embraced by the multitude.\"\n\nLi Jiamo says: \"Though suppleness and weakness are not the Dao itself, they approach non-action. Though rigidity and strength have not departed from the Dao, they verge on action. Non-action remains close to the Dao, while action brings fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse in its wake, thus distancing one from the Dao.\"\n\nYuan’s note: As the *Laozi* nears its conclusion, it contrasts the gains and losses of suppleness and weakness versus rigidity and strength, and the following three chapters all elaborate on this theme.\n\nThe sixty-third chapter.",

      "translated_text": "The Way of Heaven is perhaps like the drawing of a bow. The high is pressed down, the low is lifted up. The excessive is reduced, the deficient is replenished. The Way of Heaven reduces the excessive to replenish the deficient. The way of the ruler is not so: it reduces the deficient to serve the excessive. Who can take what is excessive to serve the world? Only one who possesses the Way.\n\nThus the sage acts yet does not rely on it, achieves success yet does not dwell in it. Does he not wish to display his worth?\n\nThis carries forward the meaning of the previous chapter—how suppleness dwells below and strength above—by illustrating it through the Way of Heaven. As the *Laozi* says: \"To contract it, one must first expand it.\" Thus, drawing the bow is an act of strength. The Way of Heaven detests fullness and favors humility. Just as a drawn bow, if held too long, will slacken, so too will slackness eventually be drawn taut. Therefore, whatever is high must inevitably press itself down, and whatever is low must be lifted; whatever is excessive must inevitably reduce itself, and whatever is diminished must extend. Heaven treats all things in this manner. Humans, however, are not so: they diminish the world’s deficiency to serve their own excess, losing the intent of Heaven. The sage, though possessing the utmost worth, does not wish to display it. This is the daily diminishing of the Way, which must proceed until it is diminished again and again.\n\nSu Zhe says: \"When a bow is drawn, the sinew is above; when relaxed, the horn is above. Thus it serves as an analogy for Heaven’s pressing down the high and lifting up the low. Heaven is impartial, hence it equalizes. Humans are partial, hence they do not equalize. One who possesses the Way nourishes and suffices the myriad things yet declines credit. Having acted for others, one’s own abundance increases; having given to others, one’s own store grows greater. None but one who possesses the Way can endure this. To act and rely on it, to succeed and dwell in it, is to display worth in the world. To display worth in the world is to take one’s excess to serve oneself.\"\n\nLü Huiqing says: \"The Way of Heaven does not deliberately press down the high and lift up the low. By acting without contrivance, it is without partiality; being without partiality, it equalizes. Thus, allowing things to follow their nature, the excessive cannot but be pressed down and reduced, and the deficient cannot but be lifted up and replenished. This is what is meant by 'the reed banner is diminished, humility receives benefit'—such is the Way of Heaven in its time. The way of humans cannot be without contrivance, and being unable to act without contrivance, they cannot be without desire. Being unable to be without desire, they proceed to diminish others to benefit themselves. Only one who possesses the Way knows that nothing has ever truly existed. All the fame and merit of contrived action are but what I possess in excess, while what the world lacks and contends over. Thus, one reduces it to serve the world without claiming possession.\"\n\nWu Cheng says: \"The pressing down and lifting up refer to the drawing of the bow; the reducing and replenishing refer to the Way of Heaven.\"\n\nLu Xisheng says: \"When yang ascends to its utmost in the heavens, it descends; when yin descends to its utmost in the earth, it ascends. This is the image of pressing down the high and lifting up the low, like the drawing of a bow. The Way of Heaven waxes and wanes, intercalating seven times in a chapter. It reduces the excess of the sun to replenish the deficiency of the moon. The way of humans is not so: it diminishes the deficient people to serve the excessive ruler. Who can model the Way of Heaven to become the way of humans? In the *Book of Changes*, diminishing the lower to benefit the upper is called 'diminishing'; diminishing the upper to benefit the lower is called 'benefiting.' The lower is the root.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Master has spoken of this repeatedly, yet many regard it lightly. Thus, though they know it, none can put it into practice. As the text draws to a close, he once more raises the point, saying: Take heed not to treat these words as trivial. For all beings with blood and qi possess the heart of contention. In ordinary times, none fail to recognize the goodness of softness and weakness; yet when disgrace and adversity suddenly strike, they cannot help but flare up—so abruptly does their hardness and strength erupt that they cannot endure it.\n\nMountains and marshes harbor illness; rivers and lakes receive filth; a lord of state bears disgrace. Now, if one clings to talent and strength, ever serving as the nominal master of wisdom, entrusting affairs to the house of schemes—ensnared by the heart of contention—how can one hope to preserve one’s rank as a lord or king? These words may seem contrary to common sentiment, yet they truly embody the upright Dao. The world deems bearing disgrace and misfortune to be calamity.\n\nThe following chapter, “Harmonizing great enmity leaves residual enmity,” further develops this idea. The sage holds the left tally and makes no demand upon others. Thus, one of power attends to the tally; one without power attends to the tax. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality—it ever accords with the good.\n\nThis continues the previous chapter’s theme of bearing disgrace and misfortune, expounding the difficulty of embodying non-contention and selflessness. For softness and weakness are easily applied in times of peace, but difficult when matters arise; bearing petty grudges is easy, while enduring great adversity is hard. If one who studies the Dao forcibly harmonizes great enmity yet harbors hidden anger and lingering resentment within, even if it never erupts, the slightest grievance remains as weighty as a mountain—how then can one speak of attaining the supreme goodness of water’s Way?\n\nWhat is called “power as goodness” means: I treat the good with goodness, and the not-good with goodness as well. This is what the sage means by holding the left tally. A contract has two halves: I hold the left, and if one comes with the right to make a claim, I simply give wealth and goods, never making demands upon others. The sage’s response to all things is effortless and uncontrived—receiving all without refusal, just so.\n\nThe one who comes sees no enmity; the one who gives does not consider it power. Power and enmity both vanish, self and other merge as one—only then has one truly embodied the power of non-contention and selflessness. How can those who merely harmonize enmity compare? For when power is not yet perfected, one remains like those who enforce the tax law, compelling eight households to labor together.",

How could heaven fail to assist a good person who does not claim victory? Thus, the triumph of softness over hardness, of weakness over strength, is radiantly clear.

      "translated_text": "In ancient times, states were many and small; in later ages, states became few and large. With vast territories and teeming populations, even if one wished to return to the governance of high antiquity, it could not be achieved. Thus, Laozi desired to diminish the size of states and reduce their populations.\n\nWu Cheng remarked: Boats, carriages, armor, and weapons cannot be used by one person alone—they are implements for tens or hundreds. When the people are pure and affairs simple, even written contracts may be dispensed with, let alone the tools of many hands. Taking the clothing and food they produce as sweet and fine, and their native customs as peaceful and joyful, they will not willingly migrate afar. Though neighboring lands lie so near that they grow old and die without ever journeying between them, this is more than mere reluctance to travel far.\n\nWang Pang observed: Where states are small and populations sparse, people remain simple and honest. Where states are vast and populations dense, interests clash, and deceit and artifice arise daily. Observe the people of cities and villages—their simplicity and cunning differ markedly. In an age without the Dao, the superficial eclipses the fundamental, and desires for material gain arise from coveting what lies beyond. Thus, the tracks of carriages and footprints crisscross the four directions. Examining the closing passages of the *Analects* and *Mencius*, both extol the deeds of the sage-kings Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang, for when their teachings are applied to governance, it is much the same. Laozi, holding to the virtue of the highest antiquity, lived in a degenerate age, and so his aspirations were thus.\n\nLü Huiqing said: Zhuangzi spoke of the age of utmost virtue, recounting: \"In former times, from the clans of Datingshi and Rongchengshi down to those of Zhurong, Fuxi, and Shennong, the people knotted cords for use. They found sweetness in their food, beauty in their garments, peace in their dwellings, and joy in their customs. Neighboring states gazed upon one another; the cries of their cocks and dogs were heard across the land. Yet the people grew old and died without ever journeying between them.\" Such was not merely Laozi’s vision—it was an ancient Dao indeed. Yet written records begin with the Tang and Yu dynasties, and Laozi sought to return to the governance of remote antiquity. The world had long since departed from high antiquity—could it truly be fully restored? No, it could not. Yet if it could not, why speak of it? In the declining Zhou, refinement and artifice had utterly vanquished simplicity and sincerity. Only the great Dao could restore people to the essence of their nature. To speak of the Dao without addressing the age is insufficient to grasp how the great Dao has been tested. This is why Laozi necessarily returned to the governance of high antiquity.\n\nRites reached their perfection in the synthesis of the Three Dynasties; music attained its fullness in the refinement of the Six Eras. Yet one does not place dark water beneath sweet wine or add shrill pipes above the clear tones of the *shu* and *yue* flutes. This is to make people understand that the rites and music of later ages were unavoidable, and that the proper return to the root is thus. Hearing of antiquity, where implements of tens were unused and boats, carriages, armor, and weapons were not arrayed, one realizes that mobilizing great affairs and vast multitudes is not done by choice. Hearing that the people knotted cords to govern and grew old and died without journeying between lands, one sees that elaborate laws and wearying decrees, the ceaseless coming and going of wheels and hooves, are also not by choice. How then could one willingly impose troublesome affairs to deepen the faults of the people? To wish the world not to be peaceful and secure would be impossible. Had Laozi perished without speaking, it would be like removing dark water and clearing the shrill pipes—who would then understand the frugality of rites and the moderation of music as the intent to return to the root and restore the beginning? The Han, succeeding the Qin, ultimately achieved near-abolition of punishments through non-action and tranquility. Thus, the words of the perfected one were no small contribution.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven**\nTruthful words are not fine; fine words are not truthful. The good do not dispute; the disputatious are not good. The wise are not broadly learned; the broadly learned are not wise. The sage does not accumulate. Having acted for others, he possesses more. Having given to others, he has more. The Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm. The Dao of the sage acts and does not contend.\n\nWang Bi said: Truthful words are not fine—they reside in substance and plainness. The good do not dispute—their root lies in simplicity. The wise are not broadly learned—their ultimate lies in unity. \"He possesses more\" means he is revered by all things. \"He has more\" means all things return to him. \"Benefits and does not harm\" means its movement constantly generates and completes.\n\nWu Cheng said: This final chapter of the text speaks thus, and so it is peaceful, simple, uncontentious, and unlearned. For it is truly good and truly wise, and thus all its words are real, without embellishment to make them fine. \"Does not accumulate\" means emptiness and nothingness. Being empty and nothing, its responses are inexhaustible. To regard accumulation as possession is to limit one’s responses—how could one then possess more and have more? Zhuangzi, describing Laozi’s learning, said: \"To regard accumulation as insufficiency, to have no hoarding and thus have surplus\"—this is what is meant. \"Benefit\" is the opposite of \"harm\"; \"act\" is the origin of \"contend.\" To benefit through non-benefit is thus to avoid harm. To act through non-action is thus to avoid contention. To avoid contention is to be without self; to be without self is to act without acting.\n\nJiao Hong said: Laozi’s text, if one receives and savors it, approaches the fine. If one exhausts the principles of the myriad things without omission, it approaches disputation and broad learning. Yet why is it said to be truthful and not fine, good and not disputatious, wise and not broadly learned? Because the five thousand words all speak of the Dao of non-accumulation. Non-accumulation means the mind is unbound, and thus words are as if without words. Therefore, it is not that he does not act for others, but he never divides what he possesses. It is not that he does not give to others, but he never diminishes his abundance. What harm then in disputation and broad learning? If one merely clings to opinions and contends with the world, one becomes like those whose many words lead to exhaustion—this is not the Dao of Heaven. The scholar, understanding this, should empty the mind and forget words.",

      "translated_text": "I have heard that in the south there is a bird called the phoenix. Where the phoenix dwells, mountains of piled stone stretch a thousand *li*, and the waters of the Yellow River flow beneath. The phoenix alights there, and Heaven provides its food. The trees there are called *qiong*, their branches rising a hundred *ren* high, bearing fruits of *qiulin* and *langgan*. Heaven also produces *limi* grain, and a one-headed, three-faced being takes turns rising to guard the *langgan*. The markings of the phoenix bear sagely wisdom upon its crown and humane virtue upon its breast, with intelligence to its left and worthiness to its right.\n\nIt is also said: Confucius was reading the *Spring and Autumn Annals* when Lao Dan, squatting by the stove with a wine vessel, listened.\n\nThe *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals* states: A man of Jing lost his bow and was unwilling to search for it, saying, \"A man of Jing lost it; a man of Jing will find it. Why search?\" When Confucius heard this, he said, \"Remove the word 'Jing,' and it would suffice.\" When Lao Dan heard it, he said, \"Remove the word 'man,' and it would suffice.\"\n\nThe *Garden of Persuasions* in its \"Reverence and Caution\" chapter records Laozi as saying: \"When you gain what benefits you, you must consider what harms you. When you delight in what you have achieved, you must reflect on what may ruin it. Heaven rewards those who do good with fortune and punishes those who do evil with misfortune. Thus it is said: Misfortune leans upon fortune, and fortune lies hidden within misfortune. Be warned, be cautious. If a noble person does not strive, how can they prepare? One who understands Heaven does not lose the seasons; one who understands Earth does not lose resources. If you are vigilant day and night, you will avoid disaster.\"\n\nXunzi said: When Confucius visited Zhou, he entered the temple of Hou Ji. Before the steps on the right stood a bronze figure with three seals upon its mouth and an inscription on its back that read: \"An ancient man cautious of speech. Be warned! Be warned! Do not speak excessively—excessive speech leads to many failures. Do not act excessively—excessive action leads to many troubles. In comfort and joy, remain vigilant. Do not do what you may regret. Do not say, 'What harm is there?'—for calamity will grow. Do not say, 'What danger is there?'—for calamity will swell. Do not say, 'What ruin is there?'—for calamity will ignite. Do not say, 'No one hears'—for the spirits watch over men. A flame that does not cease—how can it not bring fiery disaster? A trickle that is not dammed—it will become a great river. A thread that does not break—it may become a net. A twig that is not snapped—it will require an axe. If you are truly cautious, this is the root of fortune. To say, 'What harm is there?' is the gate of misfortune. The violent do not meet a natural death. Those who love to prevail will meet their match. Thieves hate their masters; the people resent their superiors. The noble person knows that none in the world can be placed above them, so they humble themselves. They know that none among the multitude can be placed before them, so they follow behind. With warmth, reverence, and careful virtue, they make others admire them. Holding to the feminine and keeping low, none can surpass them. While others rush toward that, I alone hold to this. While others are confused, I alone do not waver. I conceal my wisdom within and do not display my skills. Though I may be exalted, others will not harm me. Who can do this? Though the Yangtze and the sea lie to the left, they surpass the hundred rivers because they are low. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality—it constantly bestows upon the good.\"\n\nWhen Confucius had finished reading this text, he turned to his disciples and said, \"Remember this well. These words are true and hit the mark, sincere and trustworthy.\"\n\nWang Yinglin said: The *Imperial Survey* records that Wu Ren asked Grand Duke Wang, \"May I hear the admonitions of the Five Emperors?\" The Grand Duke replied, \"The admonition of the Yellow Emperor states: 'When I dwell above the people, I tremble with fear that evening may not come until morning.' Thus he made a bronze figure with three seals upon its mouth, saying, 'An ancient man cautious of speech.' According to the *Records of Arts and Letters*, among the Daoist texts are six chapters of the Yellow Emperor’s inscriptions. Cai Yong’s *Inscriptions and Admonitions* mentions the Yellow Emperor’s method of the *jinji*. The *Imperial Survey* was compiled during the reign of Emperor Wen of Wei, when the books from the *Seven Summaries* of the Han still existed. The *Inscription of the Bronze Figure* was likely one of the six chapters. He Mengchun said: Among the admonitions, phrases like 'A thread that does not break may become a net' and 'A twig that is not snapped will require an axe' also appear in the *Bamboo Annals of Ji Tomb*. The lines 'Thieves hate their masters; the people resent their superiors' are also cited by the wife of Bo Zong in the *Zuozhuan*. This shows they were ancient sayings. As for their main purport, they align with the writings of Laozi. For instance, 'If you are truly cautious, this is the root of fortune; to say, \"What harm is there?\" is the gate of misfortune' corresponds to Laozi’s 'Misfortune leans upon fortune; fortune lies hidden within misfortune.' The line 'The violent do not meet a natural death' corresponds to Laozi’s 'The hard and strong are companions of death.' The lines 'Knowing that none in the world can be placed above them, so they humble themselves; knowing that none among the multitude can be placed before them, so they follow behind' correspond to Laozi’s 'To lead the people, one must speak as though beneath them; to guide the people, one must place oneself behind them.' However, Laozi’s desire to lead and guide stems from self-interest, whereas this text is more impartial. The line 'Holding to the feminine and keeping low, none can surpass them' corresponds to Laozi’s 'Putting oneself behind, one advances; setting oneself aside, one endures.' The line 'While others rush toward that, I alone hold to this' corresponds to Laozi’s 'Know the masculine, hold to the feminine; know the honorable, hold to the humble.' The line 'While others are confused, I alone do not waver' corresponds to Laozi’s 'Dwelling where the multitude shuns, the multitude all have more than enough, while I alone seem lacking.' The line 'I conceal my wisdom within and do not display my skills' corresponds to Laozi’s 'Harmonizing one’s light, blending with the dust; the multitude are bright, I alone am dim.' The line 'Though the Yangtze and the sea lie to the left, they surpass the hundred rivers because they are low' corresponds to Laozi’s 'The reason the Yangtze and the sea can be kings of the hundred valleys is that they excel at being low.' Thus, the noble person values the left. The line 'The Way of Heaven shows no partiality—it constantly bestows upon the good' is also found in Laozi.\"",

Lao Dan said: \"Have you come? I have heard you are a worthy man of the northern regions. Have you attained the Dao?\"\n\nIt is further said: Laozi saw five of Confucius’ disciples and asked: \"Who is this in front?\" They replied: \"Zilu is brave and strong. Next is Zigong, who is wise.

      "translated_text": "The *Book of the Zhou Archivist* thus proves not to be without foundation, and the reason Huang-Lao are jointly invoked may also be traced to this source.\n\n**Postscript:**\nMaster Hugong’s *Exhortation to Study* fiercely denounces Laozi, claiming that he became the refuge for later figures like Zhang Yu, Kong Guang, Hu Guang, and Feng Dao—those who outwardly stole the name of the humane while covertly sowing chaos throughout the realm, causing the principles of the Dao and the standards of law to crumble in obscurity. Hence his vehement condemnation.\n\nConfucius despised the village worthies, yet the village worthies’ twisted learning and sycophantic worldliness—whether the likes of Li Si and Gongsun Hong, who were either renegades of Xunzi’s school or falsely draped themselves in Confucian garb—all began with some ulterior motive. As for the more recent village worthies, ignorant and unskilled yet blending with the dust and harmonizing their light, they merely flatter and drift, harming the teachings of the age. They belong in the *Biographies of Flatterers and Favorites*, not among those who claim Laozi’s mantle.\n\nLaozi’s upright words seem paradoxical: he governs the state with uprightness, employs the military with cunning, takes deep roots and tranquil extremes as his essence, and conceals his capacity to await the right moment as his function. Though distinct from the orthodox learning of the Six Arts, his meaning is profound and far-reaching, with few able to grasp its full import. Liu Zhiji dismissed the *Heshang Gong* commentary as spurious, while followers like Yan Junping, Wang Bi, and Fu Yi—though lacking the means to plumb its depths—have been among the few across the ages who intuitively understood its intent. Sima Qian’s critiques and the grand essentials of the masters, along with the *Records of the Grand Historian*’s brief classification of the Daoist school, scarcely suffice to convey it.\n\nIn the early years of the Western Han, the prevailing ethos saw Laozi eclipse the Confucians. After the Taichu era of Emperor Wu, the Six Classics gradually came to light, and the Confucians eclipsed Laozi. Those who truly grasped the Dao of Lao Dan—Emperor Taizong Wen, the Marquis of Liu, Gai Gong, Emperor Guangwu of the Later Han, Ji An with his forthright speech, and the two Shu brothers with their prescience—all achieved governance through it. Those who failed to grasp it, like Yang Xiong, were mere literary scholars, not Daoists, and utterly missed its practical application.",

      "translated_text": "Those who merely dwell in obscurity for self-preservation merely resemble the Dao without truly embodying it. Yi Yin, the Grand Duke, Guan Zhong, and Ji Ran were all Daoists—adept at turning misfortune into fortune and defeat into triumph. The *Golden Tablets* and *Six Strategies* contain the arts of seizing states and governing the world, which Confucians, constrained by their rigid doctrines, dare not speak of. Outwardly, they cultivated the fundamental governance of tranquility, emptiness, and prudence; inwardly, they harbored the applications of resilience, concealment, consolidation, and strategic maneuvering. When restrained, they were profoundly deep; when at rest, they were endlessly subtle. Discerning the moment and striking once, they shattered all opposition. Compared to the rulers who wielded control, they embodied the mastery of \"specializing in qi to achieve suppleness\" and \"emptiness as the root of all things,\" returning to the One without leaving traces of deliberate action. Thus, their legacy branched into Legalism, the *Yin Fu Jing*, and military strategy—yet these remain but superficial forms, far removed from the essence. The Dao of Laozi ever resides in the yin to govern the yang, abides in stillness to observe motion, nurtures obscurity to await clarity, and employs softness to master hardness. This stands in stark contrast to the practices of Zhuangzi and Liezi, who refined their spirit and soared beyond the world. Hence, it is called the art of the ruler facing south.\n\nAnnotations and commentaries number in the dozens or hundreds. {The Ming founder’s annotated edition is unseen, yet the Ming founder, though employing Laozi’s teachings, degenerated into the poison of Shen Buhai and Han Fei—precisely due to misinterpreting the sage’s words on \"impartiality toward the myriad things as straw dogs.\"} Few have delved deeply into its essence. Only Shao Yao’s remark that \"Laozi grasped the essence of the *Yi*\" and Zhu Xi’s discussions in *Classified Conversations*—such as \"the ruler’s guiding principles\" and other passages—reveal its fundamental origins, clarifying its methods. These stand in irreconcilable opposition to the teachings of Zhuangzi and Buddhism, like ice and charcoal. Wu Cailu and Zhang Haoran also offered subtle insights. Among recent scholars, Yu Yue’s exegesis of Laozi excels in philological analysis and parsing of syntax. During the Daoguang and Xianfeng eras, Wei Shi of Shaoyang elucidated its original meaning, pruning the excesses of various schools and incorporating his own interpretations to yield richer insights.\n\nAt the request of Yang Renshan, I had previously included Jiao Hong’s *Laozi’s Wings* in the canon repository. Later, I commissioned Fang Xiaolang to transcribe Wei Shi’s commentary. The printing was completed in the spring of the *jihai* year. My hurried return to the north left no time to meticulously collate errors and omissions. Reflecting on my own life—like Lu Zhan, I have withdrawn from the world, and in office, I have been but a mediocre functionary, never daring to confront the court with forthright remonstrance—how could I presume to falsely claim lineage from the ancient county of Ku, betraying Master Hupo’s orthodox teachings? Yet lamenting the scarcity of commentators who truly grasp its intent, this annotation offers considerable merit in dredging and clarifying its depths. It cannot be dismissed. Thus, I record the circumstances of its collation and publication.\n\nOn the last day of the fourth month of *gengzi*, this preface was lost due to adversity. In the winter of *gengzi*, upon re-entering the capital, I recovered two pages from the rubble of a ruined residence—pages marked and revised by my late father. I have now carefully reprinted them, adding six circles in accordance with the original markings.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by the unworthy son Liang Su in the tenth month of *renyin*.",
