  "full_translation": "**Translation:**\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s Obscure Talisman Classic*\n\n**Author:** Attributed to Master Zhang Guo of the Tang Dynasty.\n**Length:** One scroll.\n\n**Source:** *The Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era* (《正统道藏》), in the *Classics of Jade Precepts* (玉诀类), under the *Treasury of the Mystic Truth* (洞真部).\n\n**Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s Obscure Talisman Classic and Preface:**\n\nThe *Obscure Talisman* (《阴符》) originated with the Yellow Emperor, for it is the Dao/Way’s subtle mechanism by which the Sage harmonizes with Heaven. The Classic states:\n*\"He who seizes the mechanism thrives through ten thousand transformations, reaching even to kingship;\nHe who loses the mechanism declines through ten thousand transformations, descending even to ruin.\"*\n\nLater, Yi (伊尹) and Lü (吕尚) grasped but a fragment of its essence, yet were still capable of saving the living. How much more so the Sage!\n\nIts text is concise, its meaning profound. Though many earlier sages and scholars have offered commentaries, their interpretations obscure and reveal in turn, leaving later students perplexed. Even those who claim a favored understanding seem to lack the means to ascend—like climbing to Heaven without a ladder.\n\nIn recent times, Li Qian falsely attributed his work to a demonic sorcerer, recklessly composing a commentary that merely aligns with human affairs, distorting the true source. He need not feel shame for peering through the *Guan* (管) of bamboo—he boldly presents his shallow insights as if drawing from the depths of the sea. Thus, the petty may steal a glance and mistakenly believe they have grasped Heaven’s mechanism. Alas!\n\nThough I am foolish and unlearned, I have always held otherwise: to seek the Dao in the morning and die without regret in the evening. By chance, within the Daoist scriptures, I found *The Transmission of the Obscure Talisman* (《阴符传》), whose origin I do not know. Its words and logic are profound and boundless, as if sealed by nature itself. I have therefore compiled and appended my own commentary, hoping that future scholars may not stray from the Dao’s intent.\n\n**Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s Obscure Talisman Classic**\n*By Master Zhang Guo*\n\nTo observe the **Dao of Heaven**, to grasp **Heaven’s Way**, is complete. To observe the **Dao of Nature**, there is nothing to observe.\n\nOne does not observe it with the eyes but with the **heart**—when the **heart** is deep and subtle yet sees nothing, it can illuminate **Nature’s essence**. Only the profound and subtle can illuminate, and this is what is called **Obscure** (阴).\n\nTo grasp **Nature’s Way**, there is nothing to grasp—one does not grasp it with the hands but with the **mechanism** (机). When the **mechanism** is flexible and responsive yet not bound, it can align with **Nature’s principles**, and this is what is called **Talisman** (符).\n\nTo illuminate with the **heart** and align with the **mechanism** exhausts the meaning of **Obscure Talisman**. Why does **Master Li** (李筌) take *Obscure* (阴) as *Dark* (暗) and *Talisman* (符) as *Union* (合), and treat this passage as a preface? How utterly blind!\n\nThus, **Heaven** has **Five Thieves** (贼), and those who perceive them flourish. The **Five Thieves** are **fate, circumstances, timing, merit, and spirit** (命、物、时、功、神).\n\n*The Transmission* (《传》) states: The **Dao of the Sage** encompasses the grand while not overlooking the minute, embraces the flawless yet does not conceal the blemished.\n\nThus, when dwelling in tranquility, they guide the **Dao**, spreading **virtue** to transform (化); when traversing peril, they employ **strategies** (权), unleashing the **mechanism** to rescue (拯).\n\nTheir purpose is to rectify the **Heavenly and Earthly**, their scheme to benefit **humanity**. Hence, they use **grand principle** to eliminate **Heaven’s harm**, **great compassion** to promote **Heaven’s benefit**, **ultimate justice** to redress **Heaven’s wrong**, and **absolute fairness** to curb **Heaven’s partiality**.\n\nTherefore, the schemes that **invert the Dao** yet **align with the Way** have five names, and the Sage **transcends** (禅) them, calling them **Thieves**. Yet if the world relies upon them, they are called **virtue**.\n\nThus, the **Thief of fate** (贼天之命), though known as **Heaven’s**, its **Thief** remains unseen—this is why the **Yellow Emperor** succeeded the **Flame Emperor** (炎帝);\nThe **Thief of circumstances** (贼天之物), though known as **Heaven’s**, its **Thief** remains unseen—this is why **Emperor Yao** succeeded **Emperor Zhi** (帝挚);\nThe **Thief of timing** (贼天之时), though known as **Heaven’s**, its **Thief** remains unseen—this is why **Emperor Shun** succeeded **Emperor Yao**;\nThe **Thief of merit** (贼天之功), though known as **Heaven’s**, its **Thief** remains unseen—this is why **Great Yu** (大禹) succeeded **Emperor Shun**;\nThe **Thief of spirit** (贼天之神), though known as **Heaven’s**, its **Thief** remains unseen—this is why **Tang of Shang** (殷汤) overthrew the **Xia dynasty’s mandate** (夏命).\n\nHence, those who perceive them flourish—flourishing naturally. **Master Tai Gong** (太公) used the **Thief of fate** as a metaphor, savoring its implications.\n\n**Master Li** fails to comprehend, misconstruing the **Yellow Emperor’s** **Thief of fate** as the **destruction of a maiden’s life**, and the **ascension in daylight** as unnatural. The **Five Thieves** reside in the **heart**, yet their actions unfold in **Heaven**.\n\nThe **universe** lies within the **hands**, and **ten thousand transformations** (万化) arise from the **body**. *The Transmission* (《传》) states: Their establishment of **virtue** and revelation of **mechanism** are subtle and wondrous, manifesting within and seen without—how could they be about **raising armies** to create **chaos and rebellion**?\n\nPerceiving the **mechanism** and grasping it, though the **universe** be vast, it does not exceed the control of one’s **palms**; how much less so the small?\n\nKnowing the **spirit** and embodying it, though **ten thousand things** be numerous, they cannot escape one’s **chest and mind**; how much less so the few?\n\n**Nature’s creative force** is inherent in us—is it not magnificent? Is it not grand?\n\n**Master Li** and others reduce the **Five Thieves** to the **Five Flavors** (五味), claiming that following them leads to **immortality** and **transcendence**—how they pervert the **Dao**!\n\n**Heaven’s nature** is **humanity** (人). **Humanity’s heart** is the **mechanism**. Establishing the **Dao of Heaven**, one stabilizes **humanity**.\n\n*The Transmission* (《传》) states: **Humanity** calls **Heaven’s nature and mechanism** the **heart**. **Human nature** is inherently profound and harmonious, thus the Sage can embody the **Five Thieves**.\n\nWhen **Heaven** unleashes the **killing mechanism** (杀机), dragons and serpents rise from the land. When **humanity** unleashes the **killing mechanism**, the **Heavenly and Earthly** turn upside down.\n\n*The Transmission* (《传》) states: **Heaven’s mechanism** expands yet does not generate life; **Heaven’s mechanism** relaxes yet does not bring death. **Heaven** has relaxation and expansion, its use has **deficiency and excess**—when expanded, the **killing mechanism** prevails; when relaxed, the **killing mechanism** vanishes, and **Heaven’s** **killing mechanism** subsides.\n\nYet **Heaven** uses **qi** (炁) as its **mechanism**, and **humanity** uses **virtue** (德) as its **mechanism**. In autumn and winter, the **yin qi** (阴炁) is severe and congealed—this is **Heaven’s** expansion of the **killing mechanism**, so dragons and serpents fear and retreat into hiding; when winter passes and spring arrives, **yin** recedes and **yang** grows—this is **Heaven’s** relaxation of the **killing mechanism**, so dragons and serpents rejoice and rise.\n\n**Heaven** also has **cold and warmth**. **Virtue** also has **cold and warmth**; **humanity** also has **cold and warmth**.\n\nWhen **virtue and law** (德刑) are uniformly strict, it is the **ruler’s** expansion of the **killing mechanism**, so ministers and subjects fear and obey; when **virtue is lost** and **law is biased**, it is the **ruler’s** relaxation of the **killing mechanism**, so **wicked and ambitious men** rejoice and roam freely.\n\n**Position** has **high and low**, as **humanity** has **Heaven and Earth**. Thus it is said:\n\nWhen **Heaven** unleashes the **killing mechanism**, dragons and serpents rise from the land, and banditry and chaos take root.\nWhen **humans** unleash the **killing mechanism**, **Heaven and Earth** rebel, and the distinctions of high and low are overturned.\nThe **Duke of Zhou** and **Zhuge Liang**, though they slew ten thousand men, saw violent winds and darkness at noon—taking this as **Heaven and Earth** in rebellion—were gravely mistaken.\n\nWhen **Heaven and humanity** together unleash the **mechanism**, the foundation of ten thousand transformations is set.\n\n*The **Transmission** says:*\n**Heaven** moves the **mechanism of calamity and blessing** above,\nThe **ruler** moves the **mechanism of benefit and harm** below.\nThus, those with **virtue** thrive through ten thousand transformations, reaching **sovereignty**;\nThose without **virtue** decline through ten thousand changes, leading to ruin.\nThe foundation of ten thousand transformations is naturally established.\n\n**Nature** has skill and clumsiness, which can be concealed.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **sage’s nature** is skilled in action—\nIn poverty and peril, he devises **Dao** to aid him;\nFacing strength and clarity, he upholds **virtue** to retreat.\nThis principle applies to governing the state and leading armies alike.\n\nThe **nine orifices’** evils lie in the **three essentials**, which govern motion and stillness.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **nine orifices’** functions hinge on the **three essentials** as their **mechanism**.\nThe **three essentials** are **mechanism (机)**, **emotion (情)**, and **nature (性)**.\nTo **regulate the mechanism** is to ensure nothing is unsettled;\nTo **govern emotion** is to ensure nothing is perverse;\nTo **align with nature** is to ensure nothing is unnatural.\nThus, the **sage** acts to suppress his **emotions**,\nStands firm to preserve his **nature**,\nAnd finds joy to steady his **mechanism**;\nThe **petty man** does the opposite.\n\nHence, later texts say:\nThe **Duke of Zhou** took the **three essentials** as **ears, eyes, and mouth**;\n**Li Jin** took them as **heart, spirit, and breath**—\nBoth forgot the **mechanism**, missing the true intent of the *Yinfu*.\n\nFire arises from wood; calamity, when unleashed, conquers.\n**Deceit** arises in the state; when stirred, it collapses.\nTo know and refine this is called **sagacity**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nWood, when still, harbors **emotion**—\nWhen moved, it generates fire, unaware until flames consume its essence.\nSo too with **human nature**: still, it harbors **deceit**—\nWhen stirred, it breeds chaos, unaware until ruin overtakes the state.\n\nThe **enlightened** perceive others’ vulnerabilities to set their **mechanism**;\nThe **wise** discern others’ flaws to plot their advantage—\nThus, the world sees them as **fools**, while they attain **sagacity**.\nThis is called:\nThe living believing they’ve secured their life,\nThe dead believing they’ve secured their death—\nAll claim to grasp the **principle of the Way**.\n\n**Heaven** both gives life and takes it—this is the **principle of the Way**.\n**Heaven and Earth** are thieves to all things;\nAll things are thieves to **humanity**;\n**Humanity** is thief to all things.\nWhen the **three thefts** are just, the **Three Powers** are at peace.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\n**Heaven and Earth**, through **yin and yang qi**, transform all things—\nYet all things do not know they are stolen from.\nAll things, through **beauty and ugliness**, nourish **humanity**—\nYet **humanity** does not know they are stolen from.\n**Humanity**, through **benefit and harm**, controls all things—\nYet all things do not know they are stolen from.\nThe **three thefts** harmonize in the **mystery of the heart**,\nThe **Three Powers** move in accordance with **Heaven’s principle**.\n\nTo have it at the right time ensures sustenance for life;\nTo act without timing ensures failure, leading to ruin.\nThus it is said:\nTo eat in season, the **hundred bones** are in order.\nTo move the **mechanism** in season, ten thousand transformations are at peace.\n\n**Humanity** knows its **spirit** as **spirit**,\nBut does not know how its **non-spirit** makes it **spirit**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nPeople do not recognize **theft** as **theft**,\nOnly attributing **spirit’s** power to **spirit** itself.\n**Guiguzi** said:\n*\"The unseen exchange between them is called **spirit**—*\n*This is the art of subtle application.\"*\n\n**Li Jin** failed to grasp this text’s unity with the **Three Spirits**,\nInstead using **sage and fool** as allegories—how greatly he erred!\n\n**Sun and Moon** follow their numbers,\n**Great and small** have their fixed roles.\nFrom this arise **sagely deeds** and **divine clarity**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\n**Sun and Moon** have their **standards**—their **cycles**;\n**Great and small** have their **roles**—**ruler and subject**.\nTo observe **Heaven’s** timing,\nTo scrutinize **human** affairs,\nAnd grasp **humanity’s mechanism**—\nThus, the **sage** attains **deeds**,\nThe **divine** attains **clarity**,\nAnd the **heart** aligns with **principle**—this is the **good governance** of **peace**.\n\n**Li Jin**, taking **degrees and measures** as **Sun and Moon**,\nAnd **remaining fractions** as **great and small**,\nAnd claiming **spirit-qi** generates **sagely deeds and divine clarity**—\nHis errors are extreme.\n\nIts **theft of the mechanism** is unseen by the world,\nNo one can perceive or know it.\nThe **noble** who attains it safeguards himself;\nThe **petty** who attains it risks his life.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nIts **theft** is subtle in motion,\nYet its application is vast and clear,\nIts execution profound and mysterious.\nThe **noble** wields it—\nIn prosperity, he benefits all under **Heaven** (as the **Duke of Zhou** did);\nIn adversity, he perfects himself (as **Confucius** did)—\nIs this not discerning advantage with precision?\nThe **petty** wields it—\nAnd loses himself (as **Zhou Sheng** did?).\nOr gains advantage while losing **virtue** (as **Li Si** did?)—\nIs this not failing to uphold the **Way** with sincerity?\n\nThe **blind** excel in hearing,\nThe **deaf** excel in sight—\nSevering one source of advantage,\nTheir troops are ten times more effective;\nThree cycles of day and night,\nTheir troops are ten thousand times more effective.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **blind** excel in hearing—\nThey forget **color** and refine **sound**,\nThus sharpening their **listening**.\nThe **deaf** excel in sight—\nThey abandon **hearing** and focus on **vision**,\nThus sharpening their **clarity**.\nThus, with tenfold forces,\nThey act three times in a single day—\nThis is their **speed**;\nThey rest three times in a single night—\nThis is their **precision**.\nThus, they can command ten thousand troops.\n\n**Qian** mistakenly took **teacher** as **army**, an error.\n\n**The heart** is born from things, dies from things,\nIts **mechanism** lies in the **eyes**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **heart** harbors **love and hatred**,\nThings have **usefulness and harm**.\nThe **eyes** perceive them externally,\nThe **heart** judges them internally.\nIf **good**, act in accordance;\nIf **harmful**, discern and halt—\nThus observing the **good** and warning against the **evil**.\n\n**Li Jin** took **Xiang Yu’s eyes** as the **mechanism**,\nAnd **Fú Jiān’s heart** as born from things,\nAnd **Fú Jiān’s heart** as dying from things—\nHe failed to grasp the **useful and harmful**.\n\n**Heaven**, though without **favor**, gives rise to **great favor**.\n\n「Swift thunder and violent winds—\nAll are thus rendered **stupefied** and **dumbfounded**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nHeaven uses **omen** and **portents** to warn of **calamity** and **punishment**,\nSo that humans may **take heed** and **guard against** them to cultivate **virtue/power**.\n\nBy stirring the people’s **terror and dread** through swift thunder and violent winds,\nIt is said that Heaven’s **governance and blessings** are without **favor** yet produce **great favor**.\n**Li Jin** took **Heaven and Earth’s lack of benevolence** as **great favor**,\nAnd **all things returning to Heaven** as **stupefied and dumbfounded**—\nHis understanding **utterly diverges** from the **original intent** of *Yīnfǔ*.\n\n**Supreme joy** leaves **excess** in nature,\n**Supreme stillness** leaves **restraint** in nature.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nBefore manifestation, it is called **the Middle**,\nTo **hold fast** to the Middle is called **constancy**.\nTo **distinguish** joy and **attain** its **purpose**,\nYet nature retains its **excess**—\nThis is **supreme joy**.\nTo **rest in constancy** is called **self-sufficiency**,\nThen to **still** its **purpose** and **restrain** its **constancy**—\nThis is **supreme stillness**.\n\n**Li Jin** took **excess** as the nature of **joy**,\nAnd **restraint** as the nature of **stillness**—\nHis interpretation **completely contradicts** the **Dao/Way’s** true meaning.\n\nHeaven’s **ultimate selfishness**,\nYet its **application** is **ultimately just**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **principles of nature** are subtle and **unknowable**—\nThis is **ultimate selfishness**;\nThe **manifestations of nature** are clear and **unresistible**—\nThis is **ultimate justice**.\n\nThe same holds true for **embodying the Sage’s Way**.\n**Li Jin** cited *The Art of War by Sūnzǐ*:\n“View your soldiers as your beloved children,\nAnd you can lead them to **perish together**.”\nWhy so?\nThe **seizing** of them lies in **qi**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nTo **seize** things by **qi**,\nTo **control** them by **mechanism**—\nIs this the skill of **great and small**?\n\n**Tàigōng** said:\n“Is it by **greatness and smallness** that one **seizes and controls**?”\n**Li Jin** failed to grasp the meaning of **seizing**,\nAnd **erroneously** took it as **capturing beasts**,\nHis annotations read:\n“Tortoises devour pythons,\nYellow-bellied beasts consume tigers”—\nThis is **pityful** indeed.\n\n**Life** is the **root of death**,\n**Death** is the **root of life**.\n\n---\n\n**Grace arises from harm, harm from grace.**\nLife is what humanity cherishes most—\nwhen it exceeds the body’s measure,\nthen the **Dao** is lost, and death comes of itself.\nDeath is what humanity abhors—\nwhen its arrival is clear,\nthen the **Dao** is present, and life is sought of itself.\n\n**Favor** reaches where **virtue** extends,\n**calamity** where **chaos** spreads.\nTo harm oneself is to benefit others—\nthus, harm gives rise to grace.\n\n**Li Jin** cited *The Art of War* for life and death,\n**Dīng Gōng** and **Guān Zhòng** for grace and harm—\nhow strange!\n\nThe foolish revere the **patterns of Heaven and Earth** as **Sagehood**,\nI perceive the **patterns of time and things** as **wisdom**.\nOthers see **Yú** as foolish,\nI see **not being foolish** as **Sagehood**.\nOthers await **Sagehood** from them,\nI do not await **Sagehood** from them.\n\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nObserve the **Heavenly cycles** of the four seasons,\nPerceive the **Earthly transformations** of all things—\nto know all yet conceal it in **non-knowledge**,\nto bestow small graces upon humanity\nso as to **nurture oneself**—this is the way.\n\nTo know the **march of the seasons**,\nto know the **birth of all things**—\nall is **self-so**.\nThus, the **Sage** dwells within **harmony**,\nand it is said: *\"Death and life rest within me alone.\"*\n\nHuman death is like drowning in water,\nor burning in fire—\nself-inflicted annihilation.\n\nTo govern a nation by the **Dao** is to **reduce its affairs**;\nto command an army by **strategy** is to **abandon its soldiers**.\nWithout the **mechanism of death**, one does not die—\nwhat can ghosts and spirits do to me?\nHeaven’s **mechanism of birth** does not generate—\nwhat can Heaven and Earth do to me?\n\nThe **Sage** cultivates the self to **settle the family**,\ngoverns the nation to **pacify the world**,\nby **establishing the mechanism of life** to **remove death’s nature**—\nthis is the **mechanism of life**;\nby **eliminating the mechanism of death** to **attain life’s essence**—\nthis is the **mechanism of death**.\n\n**Li Jin** fails to grasp the **Heavenly Dao**,\nand thus misleads the foolish.\nThe **Sage** embodies the **Dao**,\nyet the ignorant verify the **Heavenly Dao**—\nhow greatly they err!\nThus it is said:\n*\"Drowning in water, burning in fire—*\n*self-inflicted annihilation\"*—\nas noted above.\n\nThe **Dao of self-so** is **still**,\nthus Heaven, Earth, and all things **generate**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **Dao of self-so**—\n**non-action yet nothing left undone**,\n**movement and stillness** both fulfill their nature—\n**tranquility** at its peak.\n\n**Tranquility**, thus able to **establish Heaven and Earth**,\nto **generate all things**—\n**self-so**, naturally.\n\n**Yí Yǐn** said:\n*\"At **tranquility’s peak**, one knows not how generation occurs.\"*\n\nThe **Dao of Heaven and Earth** is **subtle**,\nthus **yin and yang prevail**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\n**Subtle**—this is **refinement**.\nThe **Dao of Heaven and Earth**,\n**manifest in essence yet applied subtly**,\n**transformations and adaptations** all return to **the Correct**—\nthrough **gradual refinement**,\nit divides **yin and yang**,\nfulfilling the **ultimate order of the four seasons**.\n\n**Yin and yang** interact, and **transformation proceeds in order**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **Sage** aligns with **yin and yang’s mechanisms**,\nHeaven and Earth’s positions **self-so**—\nthus, **following self-so** and **concealing it**,\n**benefiting self-so** and **utilizing it**—\nnone fail to attain the **Dao of self-so**.\n\nTherefore, the **Sage** knows the **Dao of self-so** cannot be defied,\nand **adapts accordingly**.\n\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **Dao’s ultimate stillness**—\n**music and calendars** cannot measure it.\nTo **harmonize with it** is like **birds and beasts dwelling therein**.\n\nFrom this arise **wondrous instruments**,\ngiving birth to **all phenomena**.\nThe **Eight Trigrams**, the **Stems and Branches**—\n**divine mechanisms**, **hidden by ghosts**.\n\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nFrom the **Eight Trigrams’ transformations** arise **variations**.\nAbove, they manifest as **all phenomena**;\nbelow, they manifest as **all mechanisms**.\n\nUsing the **Eight Trigrams** to **embody Heaven**,\nusing the **Nine Categories** to **model Earth**,\n**correlating with qi and omens**,\n**threading through Stems and Branches**,\n**penetrating with divine mechanisms**,\n**concealing with deceptive strategies**—\n**wondrous and elusive**, swaying **self-so**.\n\nThe **art of yin and yang’s mutual conquest**\nis now **clearly revealed in the symbols**.\n\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **art of yin and yang’s mutual conquest**—\n**subtle yet unerring in its roots**,\nits **clarity** is **trustworthy**,\nthus able to **ascend to refined luminosity**.\n\n---\n*The **Yellow Emperor’s *Yīn Shí Jīng*** annotations conclude.*",

      "translated_text": "To observe the **Dao of Heaven**, to grasp **Heaven’s Way**, is complete. To observe the **Dao of Nature**, there is nothing to observe.\n\nOne does not observe it with the eyes but with the **heart**—when the **heart** is deep and subtle yet sees nothing, it can illuminate **Nature’s essence**. Only the profound and subtle can illuminate, and this is what is called **Obscure** (阴).\n\nTo grasp **Nature’s Way**, there is nothing to grasp—one does not grasp it with the hands but with the **mechanism** (机). When the **mechanism** is flexible and responsive yet not bound, it can align with **Nature’s principles**, and this is what is called **Talisman** (符).\n\nTo illuminate with the **heart** and align with the **mechanism** exhausts the meaning of **Obscure Talisman**. Why does **Master Li** (李筌) take *Obscure* (阴) as *Dark* (暗) and *Talisman* (符) as *Union* (合), and treat this passage as a preface? How utterly blind!\n\nThus, **Heaven** has **Five Thieves** (贼), and those who perceive them flourish. The **Five Thieves** are **fate, circumstances, timing, merit, and spirit** (命、物、时、功、神).\n\n*The Transmission* (《传》) states: The **Dao of the Sage** encompasses the grand while not overlooking the minute, embraces the flawless yet does not conceal the blemished.\n\nThus, when dwelling in tranquility, they guide the **Dao**, spreading **virtue** to transform (化); when traversing peril, they employ **strategies** (权), unleashing the **mechanism** to rescue (拯).\n\nTheir purpose is to rectify the **Heavenly and Earthly**, their scheme to benefit **humanity**. Hence, they use **grand principle** to eliminate **Heaven’s harm**, **great compassion** to promote **Heaven’s benefit**, **ultimate justice** to redress **Heaven’s wrong**, and **absolute fairness** to curb **Heaven’s partiality**.\n\nTherefore, the schemes that **invert the Dao** yet **align with the Way** have five names, and the Sage **transcends** (禅) them, calling them **Thieves**. Yet if the world relies upon them, they are called **virtue**.\n\nThus, the **Thief of fate** (贼天之命), though known as **Heaven’s**, its **Thief** remains unseen—this is why the **Yellow Emperor** succeeded the **Flame Emperor** (炎帝);\nThe **Thief of circumstances** (贼天之物), though known as **Heaven’s**, its **Thief** remains unseen—this is why **Emperor Yao** succeeded **Emperor Zhi** (帝挚);\nThe **Thief of timing** (贼天之时), though known as **Heaven’s**, its **Thief** remains unseen—this is why **Emperor Shun** succeeded **Emperor Yao**;\nThe **Thief of merit** (贼天之功), though known as **Heaven’s**, its **Thief** remains unseen—this is why **Great Yu** (大禹) succeeded **Emperor Shun**;\nThe **Thief of spirit** (贼天之神), though known as **Heaven’s**, its **Thief** remains unseen—this is why **Tang of Shang** (殷汤) overthrew the **Xia dynasty’s mandate** (夏命).\n\nHence, those who perceive them flourish—flourishing naturally. **Master Tai Gong** (太公) used the **Thief of fate** as a metaphor, savoring its implications.\n\n**Master Li** fails to comprehend, misconstruing the **Yellow Emperor’s** **Thief of fate** as the **destruction of a maiden’s life**, and the **ascension in daylight** as unnatural. The **Five Thieves** reside in the **heart**, yet their actions unfold in **Heaven**.\n\nThe **universe** lies within the **hands**, and **ten thousand transformations** (万化) arise from the **body**. *The Transmission* (《传》) states: Their establishment of **virtue** and revelation of **mechanism** are subtle and wondrous, manifesting within and seen without—how could they be about **raising armies** to create **chaos and rebellion**?\n\nPerceiving the **mechanism** and grasping it, though the **universe** be vast, it does not exceed the control of one’s **palms**; how much less so the small?\n\nKnowing the **spirit** and embodying it, though **ten thousand things** be numerous, they cannot escape one’s **chest and mind**; how much less so the few?\n\n**Nature’s creative force** is inherent in us—is it not magnificent? Is it not grand?\n\n**Master Li** and others reduce the **Five Thieves** to the **Five Flavors** (五味), claiming that following them leads to **immortality** and **transcendence**—how they pervert the **Dao**!\n\n**Heaven’s nature** is **humanity** (人). **Humanity’s heart** is the **mechanism**. Establishing the **Dao of Heaven**, one stabilizes **humanity**.\n\n*The Transmission* (《传》) states: **Humanity** calls **Heaven’s nature and mechanism** the **heart**. **Human nature** is inherently profound and harmonious, thus the Sage can embody the **Five Thieves**.\n\nWhen **Heaven** unleashes the **killing mechanism** (杀机), dragons and serpents rise from the land. When **humanity** unleashes the **killing mechanism**, the **Heavenly and Earthly** turn upside down.\n\n*The Transmission* (《传》) states: **Heaven’s mechanism** expands yet does not generate life; **Heaven’s mechanism** relaxes yet does not bring death. **Heaven** has relaxation and expansion, its use has **deficiency and excess**—when expanded, the **killing mechanism** prevails; when relaxed, the **killing mechanism** vanishes, and **Heaven’s** **killing mechanism** subsides.\n\nYet **Heaven** uses **qi** (炁) as its **mechanism**, and **humanity** uses **virtue** (德) as its **mechanism**. In autumn and winter, the **yin qi** (阴炁) is severe and congealed—this is **Heaven’s** expansion of the **killing mechanism**, so dragons and serpents fear and retreat into hiding; when winter passes and spring arrives, **yin** recedes and **yang** grows—this is **Heaven’s** relaxation of the **killing mechanism**, so dragons and serpents rejoice and rise.\n\n**Heaven** also has **cold and warmth**. **Virtue** also has **cold and warmth**; **humanity** also has **cold and warmth**.\n\nWhen **virtue and law** (德刑) are uniformly strict, it is the **ruler’s** expansion of the **killing mechanism**, so ministers and subjects fear and obey; when **virtue is lost** and **law is biased**, it is the **ruler’s** relaxation of the **killing mechanism**, so **wicked and ambitious men** rejoice and roam freely.\n\n**Position** has **high and low**, as **humanity** has **Heaven and Earth**. Thus it is said:",

mechanism**, **Heaven and Earth** rebel, and the distinctions of high and low are overturned.\nThe **Duke of Zhou** and **Zhuge Liang**, though they slew ten thousand men, saw violent winds and darkness at noon—taking this as **Heaven and Earth** in rebellion—were gravely mistaken.\n\nWhen **Heaven and humanity** together unleash the **mechanism**, the foundation of ten thousand transformations is set.\n\n*The **Transmission** says:*\n**Heaven** moves the **mechanism of calamity and blessing** above,\nThe **ruler** moves the **mechanism of benefit and harm** below.\nThus, those with **virtue** thrive through ten thousand transformations, reaching **sovereignty**;\nThose without **virtue** decline through ten thousand changes, leading to ruin.\nThe foundation of ten thousand transformations is naturally established.\n\n**Nature** has skill and clumsiness, which can be concealed.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **sage’s nature** is skilled in action—\nIn poverty and peril, he devises **Dao** to aid him;\nFacing strength and clarity, he upholds **virtue** to retreat.\nThis principle applies to governing the state and leading armies alike.\n\nThe **nine orifices’** evils lie in the **three essentials**, which govern motion and stillness.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **nine orifices’** functions hinge on the **three essentials** as their **mechanism**.\nThe **three essentials** are **mechanism (机)**, **emotion (情)**, and **nature (性)**.\nTo **regulate the mechanism** is to ensure nothing is unsettled;\nTo **govern emotion** is to ensure nothing is perverse;\nTo **align with nature** is to ensure nothing is unnatural.\nThus, the **sage** acts to suppress his **emotions**,\nStands firm to preserve his **nature**,\nAnd finds joy to steady his **mechanism**;\nThe **petty man** does the opposite.\n\nHence, later texts say:\nThe **Duke of Zhou** took the **three essentials** as **ears, eyes, and mouth**;\n**Li Jin** took them as **heart, spirit, and breath**—\nBoth forgot the **mechanism**, missing the true intent of the *Yinfu*.\n\nFire arises from wood; calamity, when unleashed, conquers.\n**Deceit** arises in the state; when stirred, it collapses.\nTo know and refine this is called **sagacity**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nWood, when still, harbors **emotion**—\nWhen moved, it generates fire, unaware until flames consume its essence.\nSo too with **human nature**: still, it harbors **deceit**—\nWhen stirred, it breeds chaos, unaware until ruin overtakes the state.\n\nThe **enlightened** perceive others’ vulnerabilities to set their **mechanism**;\nThe **wise** discern others’ flaws to plot their advantage—\nThus, the world sees them as **fools**, while they attain **sagacity**.\nThis is called:\nThe living believing they’ve secured their life,\nThe dead believing they’ve secured their death—\nAll claim to grasp the **principle of the Way**.\n\n**Heaven** both gives life and takes it—this is the **principle of the Way**.\n**Heaven and Earth** are thieves to all things;\nAll things are thieves to **humanity**;\n**Humanity** is thief to all things.\nWhen the **three thefts** are just, the **Three Powers** are at peace.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\n**Heaven and Earth**, through **yin and yang qi**, transform all things—\nYet all things do not know they are stolen from.\nAll things, through **beauty and ugliness**, nourish **humanity**—\nYet **humanity** does not know they are stolen from.\n**Humanity**, through **benefit and harm**, controls all things—\nYet all things do not know they are stolen from.\nThe **three thefts** harmonize in the **mystery of the heart**,\nThe **Three Powers** move in accordance with **Heaven’s principle**.\n\nTo have it at the right time ensures sustenance for life;\nTo act without timing ensures failure, leading to ruin.\nThus it is said:\nTo eat in season, the **hundred bones** are in order.\nTo move the **mechanism** in season, ten thousand transformations are at peace.\n\n**Humanity** knows its **spirit** as **spirit**,\nBut does not know how its **non-spirit** makes it **spirit**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nPeople do not recognize **theft** as **theft**,\nOnly attributing **spirit’s** power to **spirit** itself.\n**Guiguzi** said:\n*\"The unseen exchange between them is called **spirit**—*\n*This is the art of subtle application.\"*\n\n**Li Jin** failed to grasp this text’s unity with the **Three Spirits**,\nInstead using **sage and fool** as allegories—how greatly he erred!\n\n**Sun and Moon** follow their numbers,\n**Great and small** have their fixed roles.\nFrom this arise **sagely deeds** and **divine clarity**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\n**Sun and Moon** have their **standards**—their **cycles**;\n**Great and small** have their **roles**—**ruler and subject**.\nTo observe **Heaven’s** timing,\nTo scrutinize **human** affairs,\nAnd grasp **humanity’s mechanism**—\nThus, the **sage** attains **deeds**,\nThe **divine** attains **clarity**,\nAnd the **heart** aligns with **principle**—this is the **good governance** of **peace**.\n\n**Li Jin**, taking **degrees and measures** as **Sun and Moon**,\nAnd **remaining fractions** as **great and small**,\nAnd claiming **spirit-qi** generates **sagely deeds and divine clarity**—\nHis errors are extreme.\n\nIts **theft of the mechanism** is unseen by the world,\nNo one can perceive or know it.\nThe **noble** who attains it safeguards himself;\nThe **petty** who attains it risks his life.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nIts **theft** is subtle in motion,\nYet its application is vast and clear,\nIts execution profound and mysterious.\nThe **noble** wields it—\nIn prosperity, he benefits all under **Heaven** (as the **Duke of Zhou** did);\nIn adversity, he perfects himself (as **Confucius** did)—\nIs this not discerning advantage with precision?\nThe **petty** wields it—\nAnd loses himself (as **Zhou Sheng** did?).\nOr gains advantage while losing **virtue** (as **Li Si** did?)—\nIs this not failing to uphold the **Way** with sincerity?\n\nThe **blind** excel in hearing,\nThe **deaf** excel in sight—\nSevering one source of advantage,\nTheir troops are ten times more effective;\nThree cycles of day and night,\nTheir troops are ten thousand times more effective.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **blind** excel in hearing—\nThey forget **color** and refine **sound**,\nThus sharpening their **listening**.\nThe **deaf** excel in sight—\nThey abandon **hearing** and focus on **vision**,\nThus sharpening their **clarity**.\nThus, with tenfold forces,\nThey act three times in a single day—\nThis is their **speed**;\nThey rest three times in a single night—\nThis is their **precision**.\nThus, they can command ten thousand troops.\n\n**Qian** mistakenly took **teacher** as **army**, an error.\n\n**The heart** is born from things, dies from things,\nIts **mechanism** lies in the **eyes**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **heart** harbors **love and hatred**,\nThings have **usefulness and harm**.\nThe **eyes** perceive them externally,\nThe **heart** judges them internally.\nIf **good**,

itself.\nDeath is what humanity abhors—\nwhen its arrival is clear,\nthen the **Dao** is present, and life is sought of itself.\n\n**Favor** reaches where **virtue** extends,\n**calamity** where **chaos** spreads.\nTo harm oneself is to benefit others—\nthus, harm gives rise to grace.\n\n**Li Jin** cited *The Art of War* for life and death,\n**Dīng Gōng** and **Guān Zhòng** for grace and harm—\nhow strange!\n\nThe foolish revere the **patterns of Heaven and Earth** as **Sagehood**,\nI perceive the **patterns of time and things** as **wisdom**.\nOthers see **Yú** as foolish,\nI see **not being foolish** as **Sagehood**.\nOthers await **Sagehood** from them,\nI do not await **Sagehood** from them.\n\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nObserve the **Heavenly cycles** of the four seasons,\nPerceive the **Earthly transformations** of all things—\nto know all yet conceal it in **non-knowledge**,\nto bestow small graces upon humanity\nso as to **nurture oneself**—this is the way.\n\nTo know the **march of the seasons**,\nto know the **birth of all things**—\nall is **self-so**.\nThus, the **Sage** dwells within **harmony**,\nand it is said: *\"Death and life rest within me alone.\"*\n\nHuman death is like drowning in water,\nor burning in fire—\nself-inflicted annihilation.\n\nTo govern a nation by the **Dao** is to **reduce its affairs**;\nto command an army by **strategy** is to **abandon its soldiers**.\nWithout the **mechanism of death**, one does not die—\nwhat can ghosts and spirits do to me?\nHeaven’s **mechanism of birth** does not generate—\nwhat can Heaven and Earth do to me?\n\nThe **Sage** cultivates the self to **settle the family**,\ngoverns the nation to **pacify the world**,\nby **establishing the mechanism of life** to **remove death’s nature**—\nthis is the **mechanism of life**;\nby **eliminating the mechanism of death** to **attain life’s essence**—\nthis is the **mechanism of death**.\n\n**Li Jin** fails to grasp the **Heavenly Dao**,\nand thus misleads the foolish.\nThe **Sage** embodies the **Dao**,\nyet the ignorant verify the **Heavenly Dao**—\nhow greatly they err!\nThus it is said:\n*\"Drowning in water, burning in fire—*\n*self-inflicted annihilation\"*—\nas noted above.\n\nThe **Dao of self-so** is **still**,\nthus Heaven, Earth, and all things **generate**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **Dao of self-so**—\n**non-action yet nothing left undone**,\n**movement and stillness** both fulfill their nature—\n**tranquility** at its peak.\n\n**Tranquility**, thus able to **establish Heaven and Earth**,\nto **generate all things**—\n**self-so**, naturally.\n\n**Yí Yǐn** said:\n*\"At **tranquility’s peak**, one knows not how generation occurs.\"*\n\nThe **Dao of Heaven and Earth** is **subtle**,\nthus **yin and yang prevail**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\n**Subtle**—this is **refinement**.\nThe **Dao of Heaven and Earth**,\n**manifest in essence yet applied subtly**,\n**transformations and adaptations** all return to **the Correct**—\nthrough **gradual refinement**,\nit divides **yin and yang**,\nfulfilling the **ultimate order of the four seasons**.\n\n**Yin and yang** interact, and **transformation proceeds in order**.\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **Sage** aligns with **yin and yang’s mechanisms**,\nHeaven and Earth’s positions **self-so**—\nthus, **following self-so** and **concealing it**,\n**benefiting self-so** and **utilizing it**—\nnone fail to attain the **Dao of self-so**.\n\nTherefore, the **Sage** knows the **Dao of self-so** cannot be defied,\nand **adapts accordingly**.\n\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **Dao’s ultimate stillness**—\n**music and calendars** cannot measure it.\nTo **harmonize with it** is like **birds and beasts dwelling therein**.\n\nFrom this arise **wondrous instruments**,\ngiving birth to **all phenomena**.\nThe **Eight Trigrams**, the **Stems and Branches**—\n**divine mechanisms**, **hidden by ghosts**.\n\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nFrom the **Eight Trigrams’ transformations** arise **variations**.\nAbove, they manifest as **all phenomena**;\nbelow, they manifest as **all mechanisms**.\n\nUsing the **Eight Trigrams** to **embody Heaven**,\nusing the **Nine Categories** to **model Earth**,\n**correlating with qi and omens**,\n**threading through Stems and Branches**,\n**penetrating with divine mechanisms**,\n**concealing with deceptive strategies**—\n**wondrous and elusive**, swaying **self-so**.\n\nThe **art of yin and yang’s mutual conquest**\nis now **clearly revealed in the symbols**.\n\n*The **Transmission** says:*\nThe **art of yin and yang’s mutual conquest**—\n**subtle yet unerring in its roots**,\nits **clarity** is **trustworthy**,\nthus able to **ascend to refined luminosity**.\n\n---\n*The **Yellow Emperor’s *Yīn Shí Jīng*** annotations conclude.*",
