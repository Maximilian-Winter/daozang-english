  "full_translation": "*The Jade Creek Master’s Essential Pointers on the Elixir Canon*\n\n**Canon Title:** *Jade Creek Master’s Essential Pointers on the Elixir Canon*\nThree fascicles, composed by Li Jianyi of the Southern Song.\nSource edition: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**Chart of the Primordial Immortal Lineage**\n- The Primordial Celestial Venerable, Ancestral Mother of the Myriad Qi, Golden Perfected of the Western Numinous\n- The Primordial Teaching Master, Eternal Patriarch, Most High Lord Lao\n- The Eastern Florescence Lord Wood Duke, Minister of the Upper Prime, Azure Lad Emperor Lord\n\n**Preface to *Jade Creek Master’s Essential Pointers on the Elixir Canon***\n\nMy ancestral home lies east of Yichun Commandery’s city. My distant forebear, having retired from office as Court Discussant, devoted himself to the Dao and styled himself the Jade Creek Old Man. Today, our great clan no longer invokes the commandery’s prestige but is known simply as the Jade Creek family.\n\nTwice he encountered the Perfected of Pure Yang yet failed to awaken. Once beneath the pines of Yue Mountain, again at Yueyang Tower, where he heard the sound of a flute at night.\n\nLater, on a second journey to Southern Marchmount, he sought to meet Lan Yangsu. On the road, he encountered a man carrying a set of nails and hinges, who addressed him: “Are you not Master Li? Are you bound for Yue Mountain to see Yangsu?”\n\nHe replied, “Indeed.”\n\nThe man said, “Then I trouble you to deliver a message to Lan: ‘The Recluse Liu sends his regards to the Master. How does one emerge from the ten-month gestation?’” With that, he made a deep bow and departed.\n\nAfter walking several *li*, my forebear felt unsettled. He reflected: this man knew my name, discerned my purpose, and spoke in a manner unlike the common folk.\n\nHaving sought him out further, he could no longer be found. Upon meeting Lan, he recounted all that had been said. Lan asked, “Did the man between his brows bear a white mole?” He replied, “Yes.” Lan said, “That was Liu Haichan. I have nurtured the sacred embryo, yet without him, I could not have attained fruition.”\n\nHe then repeated the message for Lan: “The Recluse Liu sends his regards to the Master: ‘How does one emerge from the ten-month gestation?’” Lan clapped his hands and laughed heartily. Suddenly, a rumbling like thunder resounded from above, and a figure radiant as snow and moonlight—indistinguishable from Lan—ascended straight into the heavens, while Lan had already departed. My forebear burned incense, sighed, and withdrew. Today, he is known as the “Master of Eternal Laughter” of Yue Mountain. See *Records of Our Family’s Extraordinary Encounters* and *The Annals of Yichun*.\n\nUpon returning home, he gathered hagiographies of immortals, Daoist scriptures, and various philosophical texts, shutting his door to visitors and poring over them day and night. Before long, he too passed away without illness. His *Collection for Manifesting the Ancestors* circulates in the world. I am his descendant, having studied the Confucian classics in youth. Though I did not achieve my ambitions, I devoted myself to the canons of Daoism and Buddhism, as well as astronomy, mathematics, medicine, and divination. Yet of all these, the elixir of golden cinnabar captivated me most.\n\nThus, I traversed rivers and lakes, journeyed across mountains and plains, and even bowed to beggars to seek their counsel. Unwavering in my resolve, Heaven guided my steps, and I encountered a perfected one within the Temple of Prince Wang in Guixian Alley, and later again in Jiangling Prefecture. A single word of instruction awakened me to the essence of the seven reversals and nine refinements.\n\nI once sojourned on Mount Wudang, and along the Xiang and Han rivers, the Jiang and Huai—no place I did not visit. Yet few I met were enlightened or possessed the round mechanism of Dao, so I sealed my lips and spoke not a word of the Mystery. By the *guihai* year of the Jingding era (1263), traveling from Jingxiang to Xingsha, my homeland was not far. There, I met old acquaintances from my village, and in conversation, learned that the strong had grown old, and the old had passed away. Unbidden, tears flowed, and I reflected: The Perfected of Purple Yang had said, “To plan for oneself is to succeed.” To sever the bonds of Heaven’s Dao is the gravest transgression.\n\nThereupon, I opened my heart in prayer to Heaven and, assembling the golden key and jade lock, composed *Essential Pointers on the Awakening to Reality*, *The Book of Longevity and Everlasting Vision*, *On Dispelling Delusion*, and *Dialogues on the Dharma*. Fearing the symbolic imagery remained incomplete, I further elucidated the workings of the Primordial Sovereign to clarify the advance and retreat of tally and fire—truly, I have revealed Heaven’s secrets. Those who aspire to the Dao must cherish this. My hope is that all may cultivate and refine themselves, each attaining perfection, fulfilling their virtue and completing their merit, to together realize the fruit of immortality. Should any treat this lightly, calamity will swiftly manifest. The language herein is plain, yet it conveys the true matters of the inner chamber. Noble seekers of the Dao, ponder it deeply. If enlightenment comes, it is Heaven’s gift, not through my humble oral transmission.\n\nWritten on the full moon of the fourth month in the *jiazi* year of the fifth Jingding era (1264), by Li Jianyi of Yuxi, Yichun.\n\n**Preface to *Essential Pointers on the Alchemical Canon* (Volume One)**\nCompiled by Li Jianyi of Yuxi\n\n**Essential Pointers on *Awakening to Reality*: The Diagrams**\n\n**The Three-Five Unification Diagram**\n**1. The Nine Returns and Seven Reversions**\n\"Returns\" and \"reversions\" signify the principle of inversion—merely the cyclical interplay of metal and fire. Master Ziyang states:\n*\"Seven reversions: cinnabar returns to its root;\nNine returns: golden liquor reverts to truth.\nDo not fixate on the reckoning of *yin* and *zi*;\nSimply observe the five phases as your standard.\"*\nMetal’s number is four; multiplied by earth, it becomes nine returns.\nFire’s number is two; multiplied by earth, it becomes seven reversions.\nThe *Triple Concordance Canon* speaks of the \"secret in lead and fire\"—this is the Golden Elixir, the Golden Elixir is the divine water of the Flowery Pond.\nThe *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* states: *\"No alchemical art is more luminous than metal and fire.\"*\nIt further says:\n*\"Within the divine chamber, essence is refined;\nFire and metal mutually propel.\nThe male yang is the azure water of mystery;\nThe female yin is the ochre gold.\"*\nThe *Canon* declares:\n*\"Pound, refine, and conjoin them,\nThen bear them into the vermilion gate.\"*\nThe esoteric essence lies therein.\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"The White Tiger’s primary scripture is the supreme treasure;\nThe Flowery Pond’s divine water is true gold.\"*\nNow, I elucidate this directly, hoping to awaken understanding.\nMetal is true lead; fire is divine mercury.\nTrue lead is the primordial *qi*, born from the kidneys—thus the alchemical canons proclaim: *\"How sublime! True lead, the forerunner of heaven and earth.\"*\nDivine mercury is the true nature within the heart.\nThe *qi* within the kidneys conceals true water;\nThe true nature within the heart stores true fire.\nMaster Shi states:\n*\"The medicine is drawn from the primordial *qi*;\nThe fire is sought in the essence of the great yang.\nIf one knows how to gather the medicine and seek the fire,\nWithin the cauldron, the elixir will surely form.\"*\nWithout true earth, they cannot unite.\nThus, the return and reversion of metal and fire are the paramount essentials of the inner elixir. Seek them within the body—beyond this, all is not the Dao.\n\n**2. The Crucible**\nThe crucible is the yang furnace and yin tripod, the jade furnace and golden cauldron. It is also called the divine chamber, the upper and lower cauldrons, the yellow chamber, the recumbent moon furnace, the *kan*-*li* enclosure, or the Mysterious Pass—a single aperture with countless names.\nThis is the pivot of the returning elixir, the repository where spirit and *qi* converge and are stored.\nIn truth, there are two:\nOne is the inner crucible and divine furnace;\nThe other is the outer crucible and its symbolic representation.\nWithin the body, it lies at the central axis, aligned with the navel in front and the kidneys behind. When lead and mercury merge, a single point descends into this place.\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"To ensure the Valley Spirit never dies,\nRely on the Mysterious Female to establish the foundation.\nOnce true essence returns to the golden chamber,\nA luminous pearl will never depart.\"*\nThis is what is meant by \"establishing the foundation in a hundred days.\"\nThe outer crucible’s symbolic representation follows the principles of yin and yang: water above, fire below. It observes the waxing and waning of the moon, aligns with the eight trigrams and four seasons, manipulates the five phases, harmonizes the four images, refines dragon and tiger, restrains hun and po, and ensures inner and outer correspondence through inversion, ascent, and descent.\nHeaven and earth serve as parents;\n*Kan* and *li* as husband and wife.\nDividing the 384 lines, one circulates the fire phases;\nMoving the five stars and twenty-eight constellations, they encircle the crucible.\nSealed and fortified, not a moment’s deviation is permitted.\nMaster Ziyang states:\n*\"First take heaven and earth as your crucible;\nThen gather the crow and hare to refine the medicine.\nOnce you drive these two into the Yellow Path,\nHow could the Golden Elixir fail to form?\"*\nAnother verse from the *Canon* says:\n*\"Cultivate and nourish the capital;\nCongeal the spirit to form the body.\"*\nIt further states:\n*\"The true person lurks in the deep abyss,\nFloating and wandering within the compass.\"*\nThis is the Mysterious Pass.\nThe inner and outer crucibles, with their symbolic representations, are thus clearly expounded.\nIf one seeks externally or clings to lust, desire, or delusion, attempting to fabricate in the realm of form, they will be separated by ten thousand miles.\n\n**3. True Lead**\nTrue lead is the *kan* male, the infant, the lunar essence, the yin tiger, the metal lord, the silver within lead, the white within black, the yang within yin. Though its names are many, it is called true lead—yet in truth, it is the primordial unity of *qi*, gathered before the Great Simplicity.\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"Simply capture the earth’s *po* to subdue the vermilion mercury.\"*\nIt meets true mercury to form the elixir and is governed by true earth.\n\n**4. True Mercury**\nTrue mercury is the *li* female, the solar essence, the radiant maiden, the yang dragon, the mercury within cinnabar, the female within the male, the yin within yang. Though its names are many, it is called true mercury—yet in truth, it is merely the liquid of wood.\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"Naturally, the celestial soul restrains the water-metal.\"*\nIt meets true lead to form the elixir and is governed by true earth.\n\n**5. True Earth**\nTrue earth is *wu*-*ji*, the central palace, the *kun* palace—it is not the spleen. When lead is cast into mercury, without true earth, they cannot fuse and congeal. It wields the sword and inverts the spear to stabilize the four directions.\nThe *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* states:\n*\"The four seas converge like spokes to a hub,\nEstablishing great peace—all through the virtue of earth in the central palace,\nThe achievement of the Yellow Emperor.\"*\nThe *Canon* says:\n*\"The three substances form one household,\nAll returning to *wu*-*ji*.\"*\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"Send them back to the earthen cauldron, firmly sealed.\"*\nAs the linchpin of metal, wood, water, and fire, the work of the five phases is complete.\n\n**6. The Knife and Scepter**\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"If *li* and *kan* lack *wu*-*ji*,\nThough they contain the four images, the elixir will not form.\nOnly when both embrace true earth\nCan the Golden Elixir return.\"*\nMaster Yu states:\n*\"The great medicine never departs from true *wu*-*ji*;\nThus, the immortals call it ‘a knife and scepter.’\"*\nThe knife is a metaphor for metal; the scepter, for the two earths. To \"drink the knife and scepter\" is to flow *wu* into *ji*.\nMaster Shi says:\n*\"To know when lead and mercury unite,\nYou may then drink the knife and scepter.\"*\nThe *Restoration of Life* states:\n*\"When dragon and tiger embrace in mutual longing,\n*Kan* and *li* unite to form the embryo.\nA single handful of the marrow of heaven and earth—\nWith intent, seek and seize it.\"*\n\nAt that very moment, one drinks the knife and scepter.\n\n**2. The Matchmaker**\nThe matchmaker is a metaphor for union. To cast lead and merge with mercury, none but the matchmaker will suffice—this is the Yellow Dame. Yet she is not the spleen.\n\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"If true lead is to retain mercury,\nThe minister must never leave the sovereign’s side.\nWhen wood and metal stand apart without cause,\nOnly the matchmaker can draw them together.\"*\nThis, too, is the meaning of flowing *wu* into *ji*.\n\n**3. Gathering and Seizing**\nTo gather is to gather without gathering; to seize is to seize without seizing. It cannot be sought with intent, nor attained without it.\n\nMaster Shao states:\n*\"At winter solstice’s midnight,\nThe heart of heaven remains unchanged.\nWhere the first yang stirs,\nBefore the ten thousand things arise—*\nHere lies the point of action.\"\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"The Dao of Qian becomes male;\nThe Dao of Kun becomes female.\"*\nThus, a man at sixteen is filled with true essence, corresponding to Qian; a woman at fourteen receives celestial water, corresponding to Kun. Qian embraces *jia* and *ren*; Kun embraces *yi* and *gui*—such is the origin of creation.\n\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"When lead meets *gui*, gather swiftly.\"*\nThis is the end of Kun and the beginning of *Fu*, before the Great Simplicity’s qi appears. Wait for the first yang to stir, then gather without delay. *\"Gold, when distant, is unfit to taste\"*—lest the delicate blossom scatter carelessly.\n\nMaster *Fuming* of *Restoration* says:\n*\"Gathering must be secret,\nWith sincere heart, discern beauty from ugliness.\nThe thread of intent is hard to trace—\nLose it, and the cold spring slips away.\"*\n\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"Knock the bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow the jade mushroom;\nPluck the zither to call the phoenix to drink the knife and scepter.\"*\nThis is the pivotal mechanism for drawing lead into the crucible—far from the art of \"refining gold through the jade woman.\"\n\n**4. Fusion and Coagulation**\nAn ancient song says:\n*\"The sun is *Li*, the moon is *Kan*;\nTheir essences devour each other.\"*\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"The two things arise from the child producing the mother;\nThe five phases must all enter the Central Palace.\"*\nThis is the five stars strung like pearls, the sun and moon conjoined as one.\n\nThe late Master Ma Danyang said:\n*\"Fire arises in water—banish the heart’s scenery;\nFlowers bloom in snow—extinguish the spring of intent.\"*\nSuch is the scene of fusion and coagulation. Those who study the Dao should savor it deeply!\n\n**5. Refining and Smelting**\nThe *Triplex Unity* states:\n*\"Below lies the qi of Great Yang,\nSteaming in but a moment.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Rising and roasting upon the mountain of rice,\nThe blazing fire is set below.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The wailing cries are most sorrowful,\nLike an infant longing for its mother.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"When Mars guards the west and Venus traverses the sky,\nWherever the killing qi descends, what does not topple?\nThe fox guards the mouse; the sparrow fears the crane.\"*\n\n*Restoration* says:\n*\"Having seized the essence and marrow of crow and hare,\nHasten to gather and smelt it within the crucible.\"*\n\nAn ancient song says:\n*\"The divine fire refines the lead’s qi by night,\nThe old turtle devours the soul of the Fire Spirit.\"*\nThis is the principle of natural refining and smelting. Those who do not understand creation should not lightly discuss it.\n\n**6. The Union of Metal and Wood**\nMetal is the sentiment of lead; wood is the nature of mercury. In the profound and indistinct, it defies description.\n\nMetal within the body is firm, strong, and pure, coursing through the four limbs—this is metal’s true sentiment, not the sentiment of desire. Wood within the interior is soft, yielding, and compassionate, like sweating at the croak of a frog—this is wood’s true nature, the very root of benevolence.\n\nMetal’s sentiment grows through lead; wood’s nature congeals through mercury. When lead and mercury unite, their congealing and nurturing cause sentiment and nature to long for each other. As the *True Unity Master* says: *\"The male’s sentiment and the female’s nature, mutually seeking and containing, gather to generate and transform true essence into the divine medicine.\"*\n\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness;\nMetal’s sentiment cherishes wood’s kindness.\nDevouring each other, they grow intimate—\nOnly then does the man conceive.\"*\n\nThe *Triplex Unity* says:\n*\"When metal returns to its original nature,\nIt may be called the Returned Elixir.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Metal fells wood, yet wood flourishes.\"*\nWithout the matchmaker’s harmony, there would be the peril of separation.\n\n**7. The Clarity and Turbidity of the Water Source**\nThe water source is a metaphor for the heart’s source and the sea of nature. When the dragon coils and the tiger crouches, clouds disperse and mists clear—this is called the waves of the sea of desire stilled, the surges of the river of love ceased. In stillness, heaven and earth are vast; in leisure, the sun and moon are long.\n\nWhether turbid or clear, it will be seen in due time.\n\n**8. Warm Nurturing**\n\nTo eliminate passions and dispel desires, withdraw the gaze and reverse hearing, abandon the limbs, dull the senses, and remain foolish all day—this must not be departed from even for a moment. Like a dragon nurturing its pearl, allow no interruption; like a hen brooding her eggs, keep the warmth unbroken.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Concentrate your qi to attain suppleness—can you be like an infant?\"* And: *\"Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.\"*\n\nThe secret says: *\"Forget the form to nurture qi, forget qi to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture emptiness.\"* The true person guards the center, and qi is like spring within the flower. When the seasonal cycle is complete, the embryo sheds its form, and spirit transforms.\n\n**9. Fire and Timing**\nFire is the fire of spirit; timing is the alignment of signs. Model the cauldron and furnace on heaven and earth, use yang as charcoal, yin as water. As the sun and moon move, there is cold and heat. The central sovereign issues commands, carefully regulating and harmonizing. Though the numinous medicine is formless, it can subtly follow the mechanism of transformation, ascending and descending in reversal.\n\nMaster Cao said: *\"When the qi of Li is reached in a hundred moments, cinnabar emerges from it.\"* There are rhythms of withdrawal and addition, advance and retreat, bathing—if even a hair’s breadth is amiss, regret and misfortune arise at once.\n\nMaster Ziyang said: *\"Even if you recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the fire and timing, it is as if idle. All depends on the power of maintenance—if even a hair’s breadth is amiss, the elixir will not form.\"* This is a matter of heavenly mechanism, not to be lightly discussed. The general meaning has already been seen in the works of Fuxi. The wise, reflecting nine times daily, will naturally awaken.\n\nOf old, Lord Laozi’s *Twelve Secret Verses on the Fire and Timing of the Golden Elixir* were recorded as follows:\n\nThe secret says:\n*\"Sun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun,\nThe hexagrams cycle in clear sequence.\nFrom Kun’s end to Fu’s beginning, like tracing a linked ring.\nThree-five before, three-five after—these are the waxing and waning crescents.\nFive-six makes thirty, returning to life—this is the monthly seasonal node.\nBorn and extinguished, cycling through twelve—this is the yearly seasonal node.\nTwelve divided into twenty-four—\nThe twenty-four qi complete the fire and timing of a year.\nThe twenty-four qi mutually shift and change, cycling endlessly.\nAll phenomena, every ounce and grain, are contained herein.\nMercury, one flavor divided into two, transforms into yin and yang.\nOnce transformed, they reunite as husband and wife—\nOnly then does one perceive heaven and earth within the crucible.\"*\n\nThese verses were spoken by the golden mouth of the Most High, revealing the subtlest principles of medicinal substances and fire timing. They are decreed for later learners of the Dao, who should treat them with reverence. If treated with disdain, calamity will swiftly follow—everywhere, divine spirits are present! One cannot be careless.\n\nMaster Pure Yang’s postscript says: *\"Great indeed are the twelve verses, harmonizing with the Five Thousand Words.\"*\n\n**10. Bathing**\nThe *Triplex Unity* says: *\"In the second month, the elm dies; in the eighth month, the wheat sprouts. When punishment and virtue approach the gate, beware of danger.\"*\n\nMaster Ziyang said: *\"In the months of the hare and rooster, when the time arrives and the signs of punishment and virtue approach, this is when the golden cinnabar should be bathed. If fire is added instead, peril will surely follow.\"* Thus, during the hours of Mao and You, one should bathe to balance them, not advance the fire timing.\n\n**11. Shedding the Embryo**\nGradually growing larger, gradually becoming numinous, gradually forming.\n\nMaster Ziyang said: *\"Fruit on the branch will ripen in time—how is the child in the womb any different?\"*\n\nMaster Yunfang said: *\"The child is young and not yet grown; it must rely on the nurturing kindness of father and mother. After nine years and three years, worldly affairs are exhausted—then it may roam heaven and earth, no longer bound to its parents.\"* Looking back at the old body, it is but a heap of dung and dirt. When merit is complete and the fruit is full, one ascends to pay homage to the Primordial Sovereign. This may be called *\"form and spirit both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth.\"*\n\nThe *Song of Breaking Delusion* by the Perfected of Great Unity says:\n*\"By the roadside, you meet a fish, still flicking its red tail—\nIf you wish to save it, quickly return it to the water’s depths.\nOn the path, you meet a person whose life is slipping away—\nIf you wish to save them, swiftly give them the Dao’s principle.\nSide doors and minor methods have a thousand strands and ten thousand threads,\nBut the true Dao’s affairs are not many—they do not extend beyond oneself.\"*\n\nTo save those lost in delusion, I briefly present one or two:\n*\"Circulating qi is not the Dao—breathing disrupts the constructive and defensive.\nSwallowing saliva is not the Dao—saliva is not the water of spirit.\nVisualization is not the Dao—painting cakes cannot serve as food.\nAbsorbing yin is not the Dao—when essence is exhausted, life follows in death.\nAvoiding salt is not the Dao—food will lack savor.\nFasting is not the Dao—hunger and emaciation harm the intestines and stomach.\nAbandoning one’s wife is not the Dao—yin and yang lose their proper positions.\"*\n\nWhat, then, is the Dao?\n*\"The Great Unity contains true qi—\nQi intermingles yet does not intermingle, ascending and descending in imitation of heaven and earth.\nTwo things unite in harmony, arising from the primordial beginning.\nThe marvelous maiden and the infant boy, matched to achieve completion.\nThese are true yin and yang—husband and wife share one principle.\nThus, there is no need to abandon—how can solitary yang accomplish anything?\nThis is revealed to be the way of immortals—how could the golden elixir be easy?\nThe steadfast scholar does not speak of truth; the Great Cavern conceals profound meaning.\nThe five phases do not proceed in order—tigers are born in water.\nThe art of inverting the five phases—dragons emerge from fire.\nThese words are truly wondrous—they are the power of the Great Unity.\"*\n\nMaster Ziyang said: *\"Abandoning one’s wife cuts off yin and yang; fasting merely leaves the intestines and stomach empty.\"* He cited the words of the *Song of Breaking Delusion* by the Perfected of Great Unity. While fasting is not the ultimate Dao, the principle behind abandoning one’s wife is profound.\n\nIn this world, those bound for hell, upon seeing Ziyang’s words, hastily annotate them with the *Three Peaks of Golden Flower* and the arts of bedroom cultivation, misleading later generations and casting scholars and gentlemen into hell. They fail to understand that the intent of the Perfected of Great Unity and Master Ziyang refers to the union of true yin and true yang within the body.\n\nThus, the *Triplex Unity* says: *\"The male does not dwell alone; the female does not live in solitude.\"* And: *\"Things without yin and yang violate heaven and turn against the primordial. A rooster hatching eggs alone will not produce complete chicks.\"*\n\nCloud Chamber said: *\"Do not claim this body is wholly the Dao—cultivating but a single element is solitary yin.\"*\n\nBai Yuchan said: *\"Within this body of mine lies husband and wife—speak of this to others, and they will surely laugh you to scorn.\"* This is precisely the point.\n\nMaster Ziyang said: *\"If you can seek the Way by inverting daily use, the sands of the earth shall all turn to treasure.\"* And: *\"Should you reverse this mechanism of life and death, disaster shall transform to blessing in the palm of your hand.\"* He also warned: *\"I urge you, when facing the battle, do not take the enemy lightly—lest you lose our priceless treasure of the house.\"* And: *\"If you grasp the killing mechanism and understand its reversal, you will know how harm conceals grace.\"*\n\nLater, he admonished: *\"If you have not refined the Returned Elixir, refine it with haste; once refined, know when to cease and be content. Should you persist in greed without restraint, you will inevitably meet ruin and disgrace.\"* This discourse guards against peril and contemplates danger—it is the pivot of reversal.\n\nIf the mind clings to sensual desire and the fire of lust burns below, the Great Treasure will be lost, the foundation of life will crumble. When that time comes, how can regret avail?\n\nI write this again to warn those who study the Dao: may all tread the true path together, ascend the immortal ranks as one, and guide those who come after. Let not the blind lead the blind.\n\nThe *Song of Flowing Pearls* by Immortal Ge Xian says:\n*\"Flowing pearl, flowing pearl,\nCast to me, so earnest and small.\nWandering the four seas, traversing ten thousand scrolls,\nRestless, tireless—forgetting sleep and food.\nI sought counsel from all friends, burned cinnabar to ash.\nFor thirty years, each day I sighed in longing.\nNow at sixty, I fear descending the Three Wretched Realms.\nBy my teacher’s transmission, I grasped the primordial qi of emptiness and nothingness.\nFirst, stabilize the golden crucible; then, the jade furnace.\nThe fire of Li stirs; the water of Kan takes form.\nJade nectar irrigates, flowing suet fills the chamber of the Grotto.\nThe Perfected One ferries me—only the great man shall pass.\nHold this in mind, entrust this to memory.\"*\n\nFrom this, we see that the ancients who studied the Dao did so with utmost diligence—none failed to meet a perfected being who enlightened them.\n\nThe path of internal elixir refinement employs no more than lead and mercury as its ingredients. First, cultivate the human Dao, taking loyalty and filial piety as the foundation, and aiding others as the priority. Treasure this body, harmonizing inner practice with outer conduct. Eliminate cravings, stabilize the mind and qi, moderate diet, and reduce sleep.\n\nThe supreme medicines within the body are essence, qi, and spirit. If essence is not recklessly discharged, primordial qi will blend harmoniously; when primordial qi blends harmoniously, the primordial spirit finds ease. Once these three are secured, the crucible gradually takes form. Only when the crucible is complete may one speak of refinement.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"What does it mean that following the natural course gives birth to man, while reversal becomes the mother of the Elixir?\"*\n\nThe answer: *\"Following the natural course is the great principle of human relations. Essence and qi are divided to form a person—essence becomes matter, the wandering soul undergoes transformation. With a body comes suffering, and afflictions arise from this. Reversal inverts the Five Phases, harmonizes the Four Images, gathers the undivided qi of primordial chaos, and seizes the primal essence of dragon and tiger at their first union. Entering the Yellow Chamber, it produces the supreme treasure. This may be called generating form from the formless, creating a body beyond the body. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, one attains the rank of superior immortal!\"*\n\n*Concluding the Upper Scroll of Essential Pointers on the Elixir Canon of Master Jade Creek*\n\n*Beginning the Middle Scroll of Essential Pointers on the Elixir Canon of Master Jade Creek*\n\nMaster Li Jianyi of Jade Creek compiled this *Book of Longevity and Everlasting Vision*. The *Yellow Emperor’s Hidden Talisman Classic* states: \"Above lies the Dao of immortals embracing the One; in the middle, the methods for enriching the state and pacifying the people; below, the arts of strengthening the army and securing victory.\" Its three sections unfold in mere hundreds of words—its text profound and recondite, its Dao deep and subtle. Though commentaries abound, interpretations vary. In ancient times, the Perfected One of Huayang transmitted the Dao to the Perfected One Yang in the valley, concealing its essence in three precepts, all pertaining to the arcane principles of inner refinement. Master Jade Creek explored its subtleties, elucidated its chapters and meanings, and thus composed the *Book of Longevity and Everlasting Vision*.\n\nNow, the design of the human body mirrors the image of a state: the heart serves as sovereign, essence and qi as the people. To empty the heart and house the spirit is to nurture one’s nature; to cherish essence and treasure qi is to nurture one’s life. When essence and qi are firmly established, the spirit does not wander recklessly. Naturally, blood and qi flow unimpeded, constructive and defensive energies harmonize, the five viscera and six bowels, the four limbs and three barriers, the twelve hundred numinous spirits and twelve thousand deities—all encircle the body, silently serving as its guardians and sovereigns. By exhausting the meaning of the *Hidden Talisman Classic*, practicing the teachings of purity and quiescence, shutting out the allure of the ears and eyes, forsaking the desires of the mouth and belly, establishing the Five Constants to govern the framework, and deploying the Seven Governances to oversee the myriad spirits—with the sovereign abiding in the Central Palace, none dare indulge in excess—one draws upon oneself and attends to the root of the body. Weeding and tilling, one cultivates the fertile ground. Thus, purple mushrooms sprout in the cinnabar field, yellow sprouts grow in the mysterious garden, the numinous terrace and spirit chamber become golden bodies and jade flowers, the inner gardens and Penglai Isles bear intertwining pears and fiery jujubes. The Three Luminaries align in measure, the Four Seasons remain ever spring-like, and all things flourish while the people dwell in peace—just as in the land of Hua Xu!\n\nThere was a Perfected One of Cinnabar Origin, whose feathered robes trailed as he approached the sovereign. The sovereign invited him to the seat of honor and, bowing respectfully, asked: \"Perfected One, you have come from afar—what teachings do you bring?\" Cinnabar Origin replied: \"I dwell within the compass, not far from you at all.\" The sovereign asked: \"What is meant by 'within the compass'?\" Cinnabar Origin answered: \"The *Canon* states: 'The Perfected One lurks in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass.' It refers to the center of the precious pearl. From before the Great Simplicity, I was born with you; after the Supreme Ultimate, I stood with you. In movement and stillness, speech and silence, I am ever with you. Yet what you now practice are merely the methods and arts of the middle and lower sections of the *Hidden Talisman Classic*. With these, one may govern the state and achieve great peace, or cultivate the body and extend one’s lifespan. But if one can practice the Dao of immortals embracing the One, ascend to the Jade Void, and attain the rank of Perfected One—when merit is complete and virtue perfected—one may serve as a minister in the Three Realms!\"\n\nThe sovereign said: \"I have long fixed my spirit upon this Dao. Though I have sought instruction far and wide, it has never resonated in my heart. Your arrival, Perfected One, is a blessing from the heavens!\" He bowed again and entreated him for the Dao. Cinnabar Origin said: \"The Dao of immortals embracing the One is the Dao of inner elixir and golden fluid refining the form. I did not know it from birth. Just as those who carve the jade of He and bore the pearl of Sui are master craftsmen, so too is the Great Dao’s returning elixir! Without encountering a teacher’s transmission, there is no principle by which one may awaken on one’s own. Your nature and principles are somewhat clear, but your destiny remains unmastered. Destiny must be refined through the inner elixir; once the inner elixir is complete, the Dao of nature and destiny is fulfilled!\"\n\nThe sovereign pressed further, wishing to hear its essentials. Cinnabar Origin said: \"The Dao of the inner elixir first takes Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel, then Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, with the remaining sixty hexagrams as the firing times. There are stages of gathering, refining, and tempering, as well as proper moments for warming and nurturing, bathing and washing. One seizes the divine workings of creation and transformation, embodying the functions of Heaven and Earth. The oral transmissions and mind-to-mind instructions of immortals and sages are governed by the strictest regulations—this is no trifling matter. Those who possess the Dao must revere it accordingly.\"\n\nThe sovereign asked: \"May I inquire how the inner elixir takes Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel, and Kan and Li as the medicinal substances?\" Cinnabar Origin replied: \"The *Book of Changes* states: 'Heaven and Earth take their positions, and the Changes operate within them.' The crucible, vessel, and medicinal substances are all contained therein. An ancient song says:\n*The crucible is no metal crucible,\nThe furnace no moonlit furnace.\nLi rises from beneath Kan,\nDui dwells within the crucible.*\n\nThe Immortal Wei also said:\n*Model the crescent moon for the furnace and crucible,\nThe White Tiger serves as the pivot for refining.\nMercury, the sun’s flowing pearl,\nAccompanied by the Green Dragon.*\n\nThis is the method of taking the Yin crucible and Yang furnace, with water above and fire below, arranging the twenty-eight constellations, aligning the eight trigrams and four seasons, drilling and clustering the Five Phases, harmonizing the Four Images, refining the dragon and tiger, restraining the hun and po, ensuring inner and outer correspondence, inverting ascent and descent, wielding the authority of creation and transformation, and gestating the mysterious pearl. How vast is the crucible!\"\n\nThe Master inquired: \"The alchemical classics speak only of lead and mercury—yet what are lead and mercury truly?\"\n\nThe Elixir Origin replied: \"These are the very medicinal substances. They bear many names—Dragon and Tiger, Crow and Hare, Water and Fire, Metal and Wood, Husband and Wife, Infant Boy and Maiden Girl—too numerous to list. I shall point directly to their essence, that you may awaken!\n\nConsider this: Heaven’s One generates Water, and within Water lies Metal. Outwardly Yin yet inwardly Yang, it resembles the Hare within the Moon—lead containing silver, black enclosing white gold. This is the essence, the true Lead. Earth’s Two generates Fire, and Fire arises from Wood. Outwardly Yang yet inwardly Yin, it resembles the Crow within the Sun—cinnabar yielding mercury, the masculine enfolding the feminine. This is the Wood’s sap, the true Mercury.\n\nTrue Mercury emerges from the Li Palace, the Dragon issuing from Fire. True Lead is born in the Kan position, the Tiger arising from Water. These are not the common cinnabar or quicksilver, sulfur or black tin, nor any of the Five Metals or Eight Stones. They are nothing but the true Yin and true Yang within the body—neither seminal essence, saliva, qi, nor blood, but that which nourishes the vital essence so the medicine may daily grow.\n\nThe practitioner takes the Yang Lead from the Kan position and unites it with the Yin Mercury of the Li Palace. With fire timing unerring, the Elixir must form.\"\n\nThe Perfected One of Purple Yang said:\n*\"Take the solid core from Kan’s center,\nTransform the Yin within Li’s belly.\nFrom this, the firm Qian body is born—\nHidden or soaring, all lies within the heart.\"*\n\nThe Master asked: \"What does it mean to ‘gather on the proper day, harvest at the right time’?\"\n\nThe Elixir Origin replied: \"The *Cantong Qi* states:\n*From darkest night to dawn’s first light,\nZhen arrives to receive the mandate.\nThe Fu hexagram begins its sprouting—\nThe eldest son succeeds the father’s form.*\nAll operations commence here. As the *Book of Changes* says: *Fu reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth!*\n\nThe Master asked: \"What is meant by ‘union’?\"\n\nThe Elixir Origin replied: \"The Sun is Li, the Moon is Kan—their essences devour one another.\"\n\nThe Master asked: \"What is meant by ‘refining’?\"\n\nThe Elixir Origin replied: \"The alchemical classics say:\n*Rising to boil upon the Rice Mountain,\nFierce flames spread below.*\nAnd again:\n*The Vermilion Bird blazes in the void,\nPurple radiance illumines the sun.\nMolten gold does not flee,\nScorched earth sends up clouds of smoke.*\nThe Perfected One of Cloud Chamber said:\n*The White Tiger, fierce and unruly,\nThe Green Dragon, wild and untamed—\nBut once plunged into the Cauldron of the Flowery Pool,\nTrue Fire erupts to shatter the heavens.*\nThis conveys the essential meaning.\"\n\nThe Master asked: \"What is meant by ‘warm nurturing’?\"\n\nThe Elixir Origin replied: \"Like a dragon nurturing its pearl, like a hen brooding her eggs—morning in *Tun*, evening in *Meng*, daily employing the two hexagrams.\"\n\nThe Master asked: \"What is meant by ‘bathing’?\"\n\nThe Elixir Origin replied: \"*Guan* and *Dazhuang*—yin and yang first part, punishment and virtue stand at the gate; one must guard against peril.\"\n\nThe Master asked: \"May I inquire what *true earth* is? What does the *spatula* resemble?\"\n\nThe Elixir Origin replied: \"What is called ‘not departing from true *wu* and *ji*’—the immortals speak of a single *spatula* per day. The *Cantong Qi* says:\n*Kan* is *wu*, the essence of the moon;\n*Li* is *ji*, the radiance of the sun.\nSun and moon form the Changes,\nHard and soft in perfect balance.\nThe *spatula* and true earth\nAre wholly contained therein.\"\n\nThe Master asked: \"What is meant by the *matchmaker*?\"\n\nThe Elixir Origin replied: \"What is a matchmaker? The union of lead and mercury—without a matchmaker, it cannot be done.\"\n\nThe Master bowed again and said: \"I have roughly grasped the workings of internal elixir cultivation. Yet the subtleties of the firing times remain obscure—pray impart the true teaching.\"\n\nThe Elixir Origin replied: \"This matter belongs to the celestial mechanism; it must not be recklessly divulged. Yet since we have met, it cannot be left unspoken. Now, human nature is like water: water gives rise to wood, and wood governs benevolence—thus is nature perfectly good. Wood gives rise to fire, and fire governs the heart; when the heart congeals into spirit, it becomes *spirit-fire*. With this spirit-fire, one refines the silver within lead. Thus the *Cantong Qi* holds its deepest secret in the two words *lead* and *fire*—the power of spirit-fire is not small!\n\nYet this fire is no ordinary fire. As Master Ziyang said: ‘Within the cauldron, if there is no true seed, it is like boiling an empty pot with fierce flames.’ To apply the firing times without the medicine is but to burn one’s own body. Thus the *Yinfu Jing* says:\n*Fire is born of wood,\nDisaster erupts and must be subdued.*\n*Zealotry arises in the state,\nWhen the time moves, it must collapse.*\n\nZiyang also said:\n*Fire is born of wood, its edge concealed—\nWithout skill to drill and temper, do not force the attack.\nDisaster strikes only because it harms oneself;\nOne must seek to subdue it with the Golden Duke.*\nThe Golden Duke is true bismuth.\n\nAs for the firing times:\nOn the third day, *Zhen* stirs;\nOn the eighth day, *Dui* moves.\nWhen the virtues of the three and five are complete,\nThe body of *Qian* is formed.\n*Xun* inherits its lineage,\nSealing and holding fast.\n*Gen* governs advance and retreat,\nNot missing the proper moment.\n*Six-Five Kun* receives,\nBinding the beginning and end.\nWarmly nurture the child-pearl,\nAnd it shall become the mother of all kinds.\n\nWhen yin is exhausted and yang is pure,\nOne transcends and transforms spiritually—\nThis is *formless giving rise to form*,\nA body beyond the body,\nEnduring through vast kalpas,\nTransforming from mortal to sage.\n\nThis Dao sweeps away the three thousand six hundred heterodox paths.\nThe Great Ultimate generates the Three Powers through it;\nParents nurture our bodies through it;\nWe must perfect our true selves through it.\nConceived in primordial chaos,\nBorn in *Kun* and *Gui*,\nVast and indistinct, elusive—\nThose who awaken grasp it for themselves.\"\n\nHaving spoken, the Elixir Origin rose from his seat and entered the compass, suddenly vanishing without a trace. The Master broke into a cold sweat, as if drenched by morning dew, or as if just awakened from a daydream. He sought out Master Yuxi and recounted all that had transpired.\n\nRegarding the Elixir Origin’s words, he sighed deeply and said: \"The Dao lies near, yet one seeks it afar; the matter is easy, yet one seeks it in difficulty. The Elixir Origin’s words existed before the Great Simplicity, born with me; they arose after the Great Ultimate, standing with me. Entering the compass and vanishing into silence, yet the numinous terrace gains truth—is this not the ‘I within me’? If one recognizes this as true, then there is yet another within!\n\nMay I ask: which is greater, you or I?\"\n\nMaster Yuxi replied: \"The Elixir Origin to the Master, the Master to Yuxi—like the moon in water: vast as rivers and seas, small as a dish or bowl. Divided, countless moons appear; gathered, they return to one. Have you not heard the *Lingbao Jing* say: ‘The Primordial Beginning suspended a single treasure-pearl, large as a millet grain, in the empty mystery, five feet above the earth. The Primordial Beginning led the Celestial Perfected, the Great Spirits, the Lofty and Venerable, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the boundless hosts of the Ten Directions and the Utmost Realized Great Spirits—all entered the treasure-pearl.’ Thus this pearl, vast, encompasses the three thousand great thousand worlds; small, it enters the tip of an autumn hair. Vigorously, it is swallowed into the mouth of the pearl—this is the myriad returning to one. How could it stop at three?\"\n\nThe Master asked: \"What is the analogy of the treasure-pearl for humans?\"\n\nMaster Yuxi replied: \"It is precisely the Dao of golden liquid internal elixir and spirit-refinement of which the Elixir Origin spoke. The Yellow Emperor sought the mysterious pearl at Red Water, yet without *Wangxiang*, he could not obtain it—this is that pearl. Regardless of high or low status, every person possesses it, yet it does not depart from within the body. As the ancients’ poem says:\n*A priceless night-luminescent pearl, unrecognized by men—\nFools waste thousands of lives in vain.*\nThis laments their loss and ruin. The profound meaning of the treasure-pearl is indeed the secret essence of the *Lingbao Jing*. It is not something lower scholars may hear; even with cultivation, mere recitation is futile. Though one hears it at dawn and dies at dusk, not one person has truly seen it. Now, the celestial mechanism is revealed—clearly, I tell it to you.\"\n\nThe Primordial Beginning is the black ancestor of the primordial azure, the root of Heaven and Earth, the mother of the myriad things—it is the white within black, the silver within lead, the true lead. The Great Floating Li Earth is likened to the palace of Kun and Gui. At first, the divine wind is still and silent, mountains and seas conceal clouds, and qi ascends to the mysterious void. This void is the mysterious of Heaven, born in the Kun palace, growing into the yellow sprout—thus the yellow of Earth. The mysterious of Heaven is the qi of wood-mercury, while the yellow of Earth is the color of metal-lead.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n*The male, yang, scatters the mysterious;\nThe female, yin, transforms the yellow embrace.\nChaos intermingles and joins,\nThe foundation is firmly established.\nTending and nurturing the bud,\nSpirit congeals to form the body.\nThe multitude treads forth,\nAll things wriggle and move by this.*\n\nIlluminating the qi of the mysterious and the yellow, they interact and conceive the precious—this is the insubstantial giving birth to substance, called the Returned Elixir. It is also named the Black Pearl, the Mysterious Pearl, the Treasure Pearl. Those who encounter and refine it do so by the rarest of karmic fortune.\n\nThe Master asked: \"Then where is your treasure pearl?\"\nYuxi Zi pointed above Kun and below Qian, where indeed there was a thing, the size of a millet grain, radiant and translucent, illuminating within and without.\n\nYuxi Zi said: \"This is the elixir of a single day. With my true essence, I seize the workings of creation to generate it. From the subtle to the manifest, success comes in three years. One who enters this transcends the reckoning of the Five Phases!\"\n\nYuxi Zi led the Master to follow and enter. Once within the pearl’s mouth, enlightenment dawned in a flash.\n\n*Disquisition on Resolving Delusions*\nThe essence of cultivating the true lies solely in the Golden Elixir. The Golden Elixir is lead-fire; lead-fire is metal-wood; metal-wood is emotion and nature. Stillness is nature, movement is emotion. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"When metal returns to its original nature, it is then called the Returned Elixir.\"* Clarifying emotion to restore nature, nature returns to the Great Simplicity. When nature returns to the Great Simplicity, life is complete.\n\nIf one only illuminates this nature without cultivating life, it is called solitary cultivation—like the moon after the full, waning day by day, its brightness unseen. When it reaches darkness, it is like a person’s sudden passing. Though the person passes suddenly, nature remains as it was, but life ends and things decay; nature cannot abide and drifts away of itself.\n\nSu Dongpo’s poem, citing Chan metaphors, says:\n*Like the cold moon clinging to bright day,\nOnly a solitary light lingers in old entanglements.*\n\nEven if the mind’s ground ascends to perfect clarity, it is merely guarding a stubborn emptiness. If one can attain flawless thoroughness, one may directly transcend to the Buddha-realm. As the *Heart Sutra* says: *\"No increase, no decrease; no defilement, no purity; no arising, no ceasing\"*—returning to your original face.\n\nIf leakage is not yet exhausted, one will emerge again, not losing the human form. Fortunate indeed! Yet this is because life remains unresolved.\n\nOnce, Liu Haichan sang:\n*\"True indeed—Buddha-dharma is the Dao,\nOne child held by two.\"*\n\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*\"The Śākya teaches cultivation for Sukhāvatī,\nYet Sukhāvatī is but the Golden Land.\"*\nHow could one fathom what is meant by the Golden Land?\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states:\n*\"White is the essence of metal,\nBlack is the foundation of water.\nWater is the pivot of the Dao,\nIts number is called the One.\nThe master of the five metals\nIs the River Chariot of the North.\"*\n\nIt further says:\n*\"Metal is the mother of water,\nThe mother conceals the child in her womb.\nWater is the child of metal,\nThe child shelters in the mother’s belly.\"*\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Know the white, guard the black,\nAnd become the model for all under heaven.\"*\n\nTrue lead is born in the northern position of Kun and Gui,\nThe ancestor of primordial qi.\nTo gather it, one must act before the Great Simplicity reveals qi—\nOnly then can it be used!\nCombine the silver within this lead with the mercury within cinnabar,\nGenerating being from non-being—\nThus is it called the Reverted Elixir.\n\nAbove, it aligns with the crowing of the cock;\nBelow, it harmonizes with the tides.\nHumans dwell as one of the Three Powers,\nBetween heaven and earth.\nThe primordial qi spans eight hundred and ten zhang.\nThe great cycle follows heaven;\nThe lesser cycle follows the sun.\nInhalation and exhalation are the plain key,\nResponding to the opening and closing of qian and kun.\n\nThus, with each exhalation, the pulse moves three inches;\nWith each inhalation, the pulse moves three inches.\nOne breath—one cycle—strikes the life-sustaining belt.\n\nThe *Huangting Neijing Jing* says:\n*\"The two kidneys, lords of water, face the Gate of Life,\nWhere the sun and moon enter and exit, and breath is stored.\"*\n\nThis is the true center of the body’s upper and lower realms,\nThe pivot of warp and weft.\nBefore, it faces the navel;\nBehind, it aligns with the kidneys.\nIt is like chaos—\nHeart and kidneys merge into one vessel,\nWhite as a thread,\nLinked like a ring,\nA span of one cun and two fen,\nEnveloping the essence of the entire body.\nHere, the primordial qi strikes.\n\nFor those who cultivate the truth,\nGathering lead and casting it into mercury,\nA single drop falls into this center—\nThis is called \"establishing the foundation,\"\nA hundred days’ work.\n\nOnce this foundation is laid,\nIt is named the Mysterious Female.\nThe Mysterious Female is neither mouth nor nose,\nNor any aperture with form or image.\nLaozi said:\n*\"The gate of the Mysterious Female\nIs called the root of heaven and earth.\nSubtle, it seems to exist;\nIts use is never exhausted.\"*\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"The true person breathes from the heels.\"*\nYet it is not the feet—\nThis is the meaning implied.\n\nThe *Bian Que Ling Gui Jing* states:\n*\"Above, the Mysterious; below, the Female—\nMother and child embrace in intimacy.\"*\nThus, the Mysterious Female is the source of yin and yang,\nThe dwelling of spirit and qi.\n\nOnce the Mysterious Female is established,\nIt is like a fetus in the mother’s womb:\nWhen the mother breathes, so does the child;\nWhen the mother inhales, so does the child.\nHence, \"mother and child embrace in intimacy.\"\nOrdinary people cannot fathom this.\nWhen the inner elixir nears completion,\nThe primordial qi naturally abides here—\nWhat need is there to ask of cold or heat, hunger or thirst,\nOr of the span of years?\n\nBodhidharma sat facing the wall for nine years\nWithout the slightest loss—\nHis breath abided of itself,\nNo other technique was needed.\nFor he had attained this Dao.\n\nTo establish the Mysterious Female,\nFirst secure the root.\nThe root of the root\nIs primordial essence.\nPrimordial essence is the transformation of primordial qi—\nThus, essence and qi are one.\nWhen the primordial spirit dwells within,\nThe three unite as one!\n\nMaster Shi said:\n*\"When spirit resides within qi,\nThe elixir path naturally forms.\"*\n\nIf essence is depleted, qi is exhausted;\nWhen qi is exhausted, spirit departs.\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"Essence and qi become things;\nThe wandering soul undergoes transformation.\"*\nThis is the revolving of life and destiny.\n\nWhat the true immortals cultivate\nIs nothing but returning to this root,\nRestoring life and destiny.\nThe medicine of life and destiny\nIs none other than spirit, qi, and essence.\nSpirit is the wandering soul;\nThings are essence and qi.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"Heaven and earth intermingle,\nAnd the myriad things are harmonized.\nMale and female unite their essence,\nAnd the myriad things are born.\"*\n\nWhen the untransformed primordial qi of primordial essence\nIs used to refine the supreme spirit,\nThe spirit gains radiance\nAnd its transformations become unfathomable—\nThis is called \"spirit immortal.\"\n\nThus, cultivation begins within one’s own body,\nNot through external things.\n\nYet those who study the Dao today\nRefuse to investigate life and destiny to the utmost,\nInstead chasing side doors and miscellaneous arts,\nIngesting metals, minerals, herbs, and plants in vain hope—\nThis is truly forgetting the root!\n\nMoreover, there are those seeds of hell\nWho falsely cite the songs and verses of immortals and sages,\nUsing deception to obscure truth,\nDeluding scholar-officials,\nDragging them into the ledgers of ghosts.\nFor instance, they distort Master Ziyang’s poem:\n*\"Cease from wife, vainly severing yin and yang,\"*\nTwisting it into the \"Three Peaks\" technique of bedroom arts,\nSlandering the earlier true ones—\nHow dreadful!\n\nI have traveled rivers and lakes for years\nAnd witnessed such people,\nLike sheep led to the butcher’s block,\nDying one after another—\nToo many to count.\nHow pitiful!\n\nDo they truly grasp Master Ziyang’s profound intent?\nFor within one’s own body lies true yin and yang.\n\nAn earlier worthy said:\n*\"Within this body are husband and wife—\nTell this to the world, and they’ll surely laugh.\"*\n\nFor within, kan and li flow from wu to ji.\nOnce the foundation is established,\nOne must not speak of \"gathering medicine\"!\n\nMaster Ziyang said:\n*\"Before refining the Reverted Elixir, refine it urgently;\nOnce refined, know when to stop.\nIf you persist in grasping without restraint,\nYou will one day meet with ruin.\"*\n\nThis is not done willingly,\nBut to emulate heaven and earth, father and mother,\nSeizing creation within oneself.\nIssuing forth from you, then returning to you—\nLike a raft crossing the river or a ladder ascending the sky,\nOnce there, all are discarded.\n\nIf you attain the Mysterious Pearl and form its image,\nIf the Great One returns to truth,\nThen investigate true emptiness,\nMerge with the Dao as one.\n\nHow can the seeds of hell\nBe spoken of in the same breath?\n\nSomeone asked Master Yuxi:\n*\"In your *Discourse on Resolving Doubts*,\nDo you speak of the Mysterious Female thus?\"*\n\nMaster Yuxi replied:\n*\"It seems so, yet not so.\nDo not cling to it as existent,\nNor fixate on it as formless.\"*\n\nPurple Yang the Perfected One said:\n*\"To keep the Valley Spirit ever undying,\nYou must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.\nWhen true gold returns, the golden chamber stands—\nA single luminous pearl, immovable forever.\"*\n\nThis merely points to the foundation of creation.\nApart from your own body,\nWhere else could it be settled?\n\nYet within it, substance and function, the provisional and the false,\nAre fundamentally no different.\nAs with Qian and Kun modeling heaven and earth,\nKan and Li embodying the sun and moon.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"The Valley Spirit does not die—\nThis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female\nIs called the root of heaven and earth.\"*\nThe \"valley\" signifies utmost emptiness;\n\"spirit\" is a metaphor for the self—\nIn truth, it is but one’s nature.\nEstablish the enclosure as a dwelling,\nThen spirit and qi have a place of storage,\nNot scattered in disorder.\nTurn the light around, return the gaze,\nAnd come back home—\nEven in haste, never depart from it.\nFor one who abides thus,\nThe Mysterious Pearl forms of itself,\nThe sacred embryo takes shape naturally.\n\nThe *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* states:\n*\"The Spirit Chamber holds cavernous emptiness,\nWhere the Dark and White give birth to the Golden Duke.\"*\nIt also says:\n*\"The Spirit Chamber has its image—\nA hen’s egg as its form.\"*\nThe *Canticle* declares:\n*\"The true person lurks in the deep abyss,\nFloating and roaming within the compass.\"*\nThe *Song of the Cauldron* sings:\n*\"Coming and going, wandering without leaving the door,\nGradually the great nature matures, the temperament purifies.\"*\n\nThose who delve into the profound mysteries\nShould truly establish destiny upon the heart-ground of Fuxi,\nDwell within the primordial chaos—\nThen they shall arrive at the inner realm!\n\nWhat is *\"establishing destiny upon the heart-ground of Fuxi\"*?\nBefore the trigrams were drawn,\nAt the very moment of their inception—\nLike the moon at the heart of heaven,\nOr the wind upon the water’s surface—\nA single taste of pure clarity,\nFew indeed can fathom it.\n\nWhat is *\"dwelling within the primordial chaos\"*?\nAlas!\n\nLast night, within the depths of Seven Stars Pool,\nA divine sword clearly transformed into a dragon—\nWait but for its form to emerge in full,\nAnd I shall show it to all.\n\nHmph!\nFill the gourd to the brim with mercury,\nSeal its mouth and plunge it into deep water.\nThe mercury is the intent within my gourd,\nSinking and floating as the water yet breathes—\nHere lies a wondrous principle,\nOnly the enlightened grasp its true essence.\n\nMaster Stone Immortal says:\n*\"The horse of intent returns to the spirit-chamber,\nThe ape of the heart guards the cavern-room.\nSpirit, essence, soul, and will,\nGather to form purple-golden frost.\"*\nTruly, this is the single aperture of the mysterious pass,\nThe serene spirit-chamber—\nNeither within nor without,\nYet clearly pointed out.\n\n*Dharma-Speech of the Elixir Chamber*\nCongeal the mind as the sun, and the spirit unites;\nCongeal the spirit to return to qi and refine the elixir.\nEmotions revert to nature, nature returns to the root to nurture life.\nThe foundation of the returned elixir lies in lead and mercury alone.\nPrimordial essence is the ancestor of life—cherish it, and true lead arises of itself;\nPrimordial spirit is the origin of nature—conserve it, and true mercury is born.\nThus, secure essence to nourish qi, secure qi to nourish spirit.\nLead and mercury meet in due time,\nBreath flows ceaselessly as the fire-tending.\nSpirit and qi never part for an instant,\nForgetting thoughts over time, the golden elixir forms.\n\nIf true lead flees,\nAnd true mercury withers,\nPrimordial essence scatters, primordial spirit weeps—\nTo seek return then, is it not difficult?\n\nMaster Liu Haichan transmitted to Master Ma Ziran the *Formula of the Golden Elixir*, saying:\n*\"I once received the true adept’s oral transmission,\nWho split my belly and opened my bowels to instruct me.\nHe split the lotus but left its heart unbroken,\nDrawing forth the red blood from my very body.\nIt surged straight to the Palace of Great Oneness,\nWhere within the crucible the true sun and moon appeared.\nYin and yang intertwined, crow and hare united,\nA single luminous pearl shone with radiant clarity.\nIt burst through two paths to pierce the Gate of Heaven,\nPlowing the three fields to sow purple snow.\nAt Kunlun’s summit, it scraped the sky bright,\nShaking the Sea Gate as if the earth split.\nThirty spokes converge like the dharmadhātu’s wheel,\nUpper and lower arcs meet the recumbent moon.\nThe work of advancing fire is but stillness,\nAs sun and moon cycle without pause.\nRefined into a cinnabar orange the size of a pellet,\nOne rides the crane and phoenix to court the imperial palace.\"*\n\nMaster Yuxi says:\n*\"The words are simple yet essential—only those who truly encounter it\nShall know the wondrousness of life’s foundation, all contained herein.\nIt cannot be attained through language or script.\"*\n\n*The Practice of Fuxi*\nThe *Golden Fluid Treatise of the Daoist Canon* states:\n*\"The ancients all consumed the Great Elixir of Golden Flower and Dragon Embryo,\nThereby attaining transformation and flight, ascending into formlessness.\nYet in that age, there were no crucibles, no firewood,\nNo five metals or eight minerals—\nClearly, this was internal alchemy!\"*\n\nThe sage Fuxi, perceiving heaven’s mechanism, drew the trigrams,\nEmbodying creation to inaugurate the *Book of Changes*.\nThe *Changes* begins with the drawing of trigrams.\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"Heaven and earth take their positions,\nMountain and marsh exchange qi,\nThunder and wind contend,\nWater and fire do not oppose one another.\"*\nNine returns and seven reversions—\nThese are the principles embodied in practice.\n\nTracing back to Qian and Kun, Kan and Li,\nThe bellows of the female and male—\nAll are fundamentally one, fundamentally one.\nBy inverting their symbols,\nThe crucible and medicinal substances are revealed.\nAt the first stirring of the night’s qi,\nWhen the initial yang begins to sprout,\nThe sea waves seethe,\nThe black turtle sprays its mist,\nMetal and water align,\nLike the toad spewing its wheel.\nGather it in an instant,\nBind it in a moment.\n\nThe Yellow Center issues its decree,\nThe nation knows no harmful ways,\nWeapons rest, punishments cease,\nHeaven is clear, earth is tranquil.\nSun and moon traverse east and west,\nWater and fire govern south and north.\nDragon coils, tiger crouches,\nMetal strikes, wood flourishes.\nAt the turn of yi and gui,\nThe first dawn of *fu* responds.\nThe hun is born in Zhen’s geng,\nDui receives ding—\nThis is the upper arc, eight taels of metal.\nAt the fullness of the fifteenth,\nThe peak of jia and ren,\nThe po grows in Xun’s xin,\nGen receives bing—\nThis is the lower arc, half a catty of water.\nAt the sixth and fifth returning to darkness,\nThe northeast loses its companion.\nCyclical and endless,\nAdvancing and retreating with the fire’s rhythm.\nThe host within the dwelling,\nConcentrating inwardly,\nWithdrawing sight and returning hearing,\nAbiding in effortless ease.\nEncompassing the ten thousand images,\nPerfecting the utmost spirit—\nAt the two solstices and two equinoxes,\nWarmth, coolness, cold, and heat,\nDay and night, hours and moments,\nFollow without forcing.\n\nWhen mao and you govern punishment and virtue,\nBathe and cleanse.\nIn a single day,\nMyriad transformations arise.\nUplifted, harmonious, and joyous,\nThe hundred meridians flutter gently,\nDripping like spring rain,\nFlowing like melting ice.\nFrom the head, it streams to the feet,\nThen ultimately ascends again.\nThe flute and reed pipe sound hollowly,\nLike the autumn cicada’s rising and falling song.\nTrue qi swims and drifts,\nOverflowing the heart—then oppression,\nThe navel and abdomen ache in yin’s pain,\nEndured with hesitation and stumbling.\n\nAt this time,\nRegulate breath to be ceaseless,\nFocus attention within the compass.\nThe yin pain is no true pain,\nEndure it with gentle intent,\nLike the tender feelings of a maiden,\nOr the spring slumber of the crabapple.\nOne feels the two kidneys as if boiling,\nThen the bladder as if scorching—\nThis is the spirit and qi of the spirit-chamber becoming substance,\nOne’s own wandering soul undergoing transformation.\n\nThus,\nDraw in a single breath to circulate,\nStir the numinous spring to flow.\nUnrefined butterflies scatter like blossoms,\nFalling unevenly in all directions,\nTransforming into jade liquid.\nAgain, like sweet dew at the crown,\nAbout to split the three yangs,\nGathering spirit and qi to fill the chamber,\nNone can retain it.\nThose who guard it prosper,\nThose who lose it perish.\nThe essence of the three and five,\nThe utmost spirit of heaven and earth,\nPure and unobstructed,\nIts spirit never wearies—\nThus one knows the true nature of Qian’s vigor,\nReturning to become an infant.\n\nIn silent sitting,\nThe empty chamber generates brightness,\nSnow and moon shine together,\nFlowing pearls and golden medicine,\nLightning and cinnabar oranges—\nAll appear as if outside.\nAt times, one sees the old dwelling,\nClear and distinct in every part.\nThe clods of earth and dust,\nNeither rejoiced in nor surprised by,\nThe mind steadfastly fixed—\nSuddenly, one’s body is embraced,\nA cinnabar serpent coils around the heart.\n\nOne may also see strange beings,\nRevealing their forms,\nBeautiful women or mad spirits,\nWeeping and pleading in sorrowful longing.\nSome foretell future events,\nOthers claim to be heavenly messengers,\nDeparting only to return,\nStirring delusive thoughts.\nRemain unmoved,\nLet them live or die—\nSince the heart does not receive them,\nIn time, they vanish of themselves.\n\nAll are spirits within the body or external demons come to test—if one fears, the mind becomes entangled and loses its steadfast hold. Only by severing ties and withdrawing from worldly affairs should one first entrust governance to those of virtue and power.\n\nA year has three hundred sixty days, totaling four thousand three hundred twenty hours. Subtracting the seven hundred twenty hours for bathing, only three thousand six hundred hours remain. Thus, the true qi of these three thousand six hundred hours responds to Qian’s one hundred forty-four counting rods and Kun’s two hundred sixteen, forming the function of the sixty hexagrams. The four hexagrams of mating—Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—are not included. These four hexagrams of mating, Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, together comprise three hundred eighty-four lines, corresponding to three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, matching the weight of one *jin*, with intercalary time included.\n\nThe counting rods of the two *pian* total three hundred sixty. Each hour corresponds to twenty-four *zhu* of fire, one *liang*. In a month, excluding *mao* and *you*, this amounts to seven thousand two hundred *zhu*; in a year, eighty-six thousand four hundred *zhu*, equaling two hundred twenty-five *jin* of fire. Within this, the tenfold multiplication yields eight hundred sixty-four thousand of true qi, totaling two thousand two hundred fifty *jin* of fire, which transmutes the body inherited from one’s parents into a body of pure yang. Truly, formlessness gives rise to form, and a body exists beyond the body. At first, one step, then two; later, a hundred steps make a mile. After three years and nine cycles, one roams freely through heaven and earth—treading water and fire, penetrating metal and stone. Though faced with Yao’s floods or Tang’s droughts, the calamities of yang-nine and yin-six, all pose no peril.\n\nWhen the Dao is perfected and virtue accomplished, one conceals oneself to await the time. The Supreme Unity then summons, relocating one to the Central Land. When merit is fulfilled, one ascends, receiving the register and chart. Yet one must choose successors wisely to transmit the teaching to posterity, thereby serving the Supreme Clarity and becoming free of imperfection.\n\n*End of the Middle Scroll of* Essential Pointers to the Alchemical Canon of Master Yuxi\n\n*Essential Pointers to the Alchemical Canon of Master Yuxi, Final Scroll*\n*Compiled by Li Jianyi of Yuxi*\n\n**Zhang Ziyang’s Song for Daoist Liu of White Dragon Cave**\n\nHare runs, crow flies—both suns hasten,\nFirst blooms the flower, then autumn frost descends.\nVainly boast of a thousand years’ wealth and longevity,\nYet all is but a lightning flash amid the clouds.\n\nA lightning flash—how fleeting!\nA hundred years, thirty-six thousand days,\nThrough scorching heat and freezing cold,\nUnseen, youth’s glow fades in darkness.\nThough children and grandchildren fill one’s sight,\nAll become bonds of love, entangling ever tighter.\nWhen essence is exhausted and the body withers,\nWho can devise a way to briefly stay the course?\n\nNo way to stay—no plan remains,\nInevitably, the body follows the flowing waters.\nBehold the sages and worthies of old—\nHow many knew the art of abiding in the world?\n\nYet abiding in the world has its method,\nOnly because men of this age misjudge.\nThey scramble into the mountains seeking herbs and trees,\nRefining lead, restraining mercury, concocting cinnabar yang.\n\nConcocting cinnabar yang—how different the task!\nOne must seek crimson blood in the Kan palace,\nThen take it to the Li position to refine yin essence.\nKan embodies Kun’s body, Li embodies Qian’s body.\nQian’s yang unites with Kun to form Kan—\nThis is called \"flowing wu.\"\nKun’s yin unites with Qian to give birth to Li—\nThis is called \"returning ji.\"\nAll things gestate in the *zi* hour;\nQian’s *ren* and Kun’s *gui* meet in the north,\nHence called the Kan palace—\nThe Kan palace is the Kun palace.\nThe southwest is the native land,\nNot the positions of *wei* and *shen*.\nPrimal qi arises from this.\nCrimson blood is the single yang essence within the body,\nAlso called yang lead—\nTruly, the primordial unity of qi.\n\nThe Classic says: \"How sublime!\nTrue lead, prior to heaven and earth,\nThis is true lead.\"\nThe Li position is the Qian palace.\nKnow the time to gather this yang lead,\nUse it to refine the yin essence of the Li position—\nYin essence is yin mercury,\nThe liquid of wood.\nWhen these two substances unite,\nThey form the inner elixir—\nNot the cinnabar or mercury of the world,\nNor the metals, minerals, herbs, or tangible things.\n\nThe blending must follow its season,\nThe medicine’s flavor mild,\nGold and water in equal measure.\nThe Yellow Dame serves as matchmaker,\nSeeking union in marriage.\nThe key lies in knowing the season—\nThe season requires the matchmaker.\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\n\"From the dark of the moon to dawn,\nZhen arrives to receive the tally.\"\nThis is the time when the first yang stirs.\nAt this moment,\nThe female dragon hums,\nThe male tiger roars.\nWith the matchmaker, they unite of themselves—\nThe matchmaker is the Yellow Dame.\n\nAn ancient song says:\n\"Three and four dwell together in one chamber,\nOne and two, husband and wife, become a pair.\nOnly with a good matchmaker may they wed,\nThus their union deepens in affection.\"\n\nZiyang says:\n\"Originally, wu and ji served as matchmakers,\nThus husband and wife remain in joyful union.\"\nHe also says:\n\"One must rely on the matchmaker’s guidance.\"\n\nMaster Shi says:\n\"Who understands the workings?\nThe gist lies with the Yellow Dame.\"\nThus, the Yellow Dame is true earth,\nTrue earth is the Yellow Dame.\nWhen the male and female unite,\nHard and soft intertwine inseparably—\nNone but the Yellow Dame can accomplish this.\nShe is the pivot of the returning elixir,\nThe embankment of metal and water,\nThe center where the Way flows freely,\nRightly positioned within the body,\nBeauty dwelling therein.\nThe Yellow Dame, true earth—\nHer great outline is now revealed!\n\nThe Golden Duke and the Radiant Maiden wed.\nThe Golden Duke and the Radiant Maiden—\nTheir meanings are explained below.\nTheir union is the merging of lead and mercury.\nThe Golden Duke favors riding the White Tiger.\nThe Golden Duke is lead,\nEmbracing the essence of Heavenly One,\nBorn of the moon and lodged in the west’s *geng* and *xin* metal,\nEmerging from the Kan position.\nThus it is said: \"The tiger is born in water\"—\nSilver within lead,\nWhite within black,\nGold within water.\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\n\"Metal is the mother of water,\nThe mother conceals the child’s embryo.\"\nWater is metal’s child,\nThe child hides in the mother’s womb.\nIt also says:\n\"Clad in coarse cloth, yet holding jade,\nOutwardly a madman.\"\n\nTrue lead is indeed the primordial qi.\nThe Radiant Maiden ever rides the Crimson Dragon’s form.\n\nThe Radiant Maiden is mercury,\nBearing the essence of pure yang,\nBorn of the sun and lodged in the east’s *jia* and *yi* wood,\nEmerging from the Li palace.\nThus it is said: \"The dragon issues from fire\"—\nMercury within cinnabar,\nYang within yin,\nThe sun’s flowing pearl.\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\n\"Mercury is called the flowing pearl,\nThe Green Dragon accompanies it.\"\nAnother scripture states:\n\"Crimson marrow flows as mercury,\nThe maiden plays with brightness at dawn.\"\nThis is true mercury—\nThe liquid of wood!\n\nThe tiger comes to sit quietly in the autumn river,\nThe dragon stirs its body in the azure pool.\nThe autumn river is the western river’s azure pool,\nThe true dragon of the eastern sea—\nAt the sight of the true tiger, one rises as the other sinks,\nBoth covetous, each devouring the other.\n\nThe two beasts meet in battle,\nWaves surging like a seething cauldron.\nAn ancient song says:\n\"The Green Dragon pursues the tiger, the tiger seeks the dragon,\nThe red birds unite with clamorous cries.\"\nAs dragon contends with tiger,\nWater clashes with fire,\nThe cauldron seethes and roils,\nInversion and restraint arise,\nAnd the infant’s cry is heard.\n\nThe Yellow Dame and Elder Ding lend their mighty power.\nThe True Stone Man says:\n\"The Yellow Dame’s twin breasts are fair,\nElder Ding’s single heart is kind.\nAs dragon and tiger wage war,\nThe lord remains unaware.\"\nThe Yellow Dame was explained earlier;\nElder Ding is the gentle fire.\n\nMaster Yin Zhen says:\n\"I am the Dao of boundless worlds,\nYet know only to subdue the infant’s heart.\"\nThis truly reveals heaven’s secret.\n\nThe quaking shakes heaven and earth, startling gods and spirits.\nAn ancient song says:\n\"The sage seizes the workings of creation,\nGrasping sun and moon to place within the furnace.\nGently inverting the essence of heaven and earth,\nGathering yin and yang to rouse gods and spirits.\"\nGods and spirits are the celestial soul and earthly spirit.\n\nIn an instant, the battle ceases and the mists disperse,\nClouds withdraw, rain scatters, all returns to silence—\nWithin the palm, fortune is transformed.\nA mysterious pearl is planted in the mud’s depths.\n\n*The Return of Life* says:\n\"At night, chaos falls to earth,\nThe myriad forms vanish without trace.\"\nThis is the single point descending into the Yellow Court—\nThe Yellow Court is the central palace, the Yellow Chamber,\nThe mysterious pass, likened to the mud’s depths.\n\nMaster Ziyang says:\n\"Within one double-hour, the elixir is complete\"—\nThe elixir is achieved in a single day.\nDay by day, it grows by a grain of millet,\nGradually forming the mysterious pearl.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor sought the mysterious pearl in the Crimson Waters,\nYet without Vast Image, it could not be obtained—\nThis is that very pearl,\nVast Image being thoughtless and carefree.\n\nFrom this, the root and sprout gradually mature,\nConstantly nourished by the embrace of true essence.\nThe Three Valleys Master says:\n\"Establish the foundation for a hundred days,\nThen nurture it through the full cycle of the stars.\nSimply guard the essence, spirit, and sound,\nWater will naturally moisten, fire will naturally nurture,\nWaiting until the qi is full.\"\n\nAfter ten months, the embryo is shed, and the elixir is swallowed into the belly,\nSuddenly, the mortal frame is felt to possess spirit.\nMaster Ziyang also says:\n\"A grain of the sacred elixir is swallowed into the belly.\"\nAgain, it is called \"shedding the embryo,\"\nAnd \"communing with the divine and sagely.\"\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\n\"Golden sand enters the five viscera,\nMist scatters like wind and rain.\"\nIf this is the inner elixir,\nHow can it be said to enter the belly, the mouth, the five viscera?\nLater generations, doubting this, took it for an external elixir.\nYet they did not know that from formlessness comes form—\nThis is called the Returned Elixir.\n\nThe True Unity Master said:\n\"First, plumb the primordial chaotic qi of heaven and earth as the foundation;\nThen, gather the essence of qian and kun, subtly moving their traces to form the image;\nFollow the numbers of kan and li, pi and tai to establish punishment and virtue;\nSteal the mechanism of yin and yang’s transformations to complete winter and summer.\nYin arises after noon, yang stirs at midnight’s beginning.\nThus, qian and kun serve as the crucible and vessel,\nKan and li as the medicinal substances,\nThe remaining sixty hexagrams as the fire times.\nRefining, nurturing, and subtly seizing the work of transformation—\nLike fruit growing on a branch,\nThe child within the womb,\nAfter ten months, the fire times and qi are full,\nThen suddenly, the spirit sheds and enters the true embryo,\nUniting with heaven!\"\n\nThus it is said to enter the mouth, the belly, the five viscera.\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\n\"Like a chicken’s egg,\nWhite and black align,\nA span of one inch in length and breadth,\nAs the beginning.\nThe four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones are all complete,\nAfter ten months, it emerges from the womb.\"\nThis is truly from formlessness comes form,\nA body beyond the body.\nClinging to the old frame traps one in darkness,\nEmerging from the ninth mud is to roam heaven and earth,\nInscribed in the immortal register,\nTitled as a True Person—\nThe moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name is achieved.\n\nThis matter is rare in the world,\nNot known to ordinary people.\nIf one lacks the immortal’s bone from past lives,\nHow could it be easily encountered?\nHaving encountered it, refine it swiftly—\nThe passing scenery flies like an arrow.\nTo catch the fish, one must cast the net;\nDo not stand by the pool and sigh in vain.\n\n\"I have heard you have known the medicine for many years,\nWhy not gather your heart and refine mercury and lead?\nDo not let the candle be blown out by the wind,\nFor the six paths of rebirth leave no room to blame heaven.\"\n\nThese words admonish Immortal Liu,\nUrging him to gather his heart and refine mercury and lead.\nFrom this, it is clear that the inner elixir must be refined within oneself,\nNot relying on external medicines for distinction.\n\nLately, worldly people are full of deceit,\nCompeting to don Daoist robes and claim the Way.\nAsk them what metal and wood are—\nThey fall silent, mute and ashamed.\n\nMetal and wood are explained in *Essential Pointers* under \"Metal and Wood Intermingling\":\n\"Without knowing this, one cannot speak of the Returned Elixir.\"\nYet they say it is about breath control and fasting,\nClaiming another school with profound principles.\nHave you not seen *The Song of Breaking Delusion*?\n\"The method of Embracing True Unity is strongest.\"\n\nSide paths and minor arts number in the thousands,\nYet they have no relation to the Dao of the Golden Liquid’s return.\nWhat is the Dao?\nEmbracing the true qi of Unity,\nThe five stars aligned in a string,\nThe sun and moon conjoined—\nThe inner elixir is formed from this,\nThe Dharma-body emerges from this,\nThere is no second gate.\n\nDo not fault my words for their crudeness—\nIt is only that the world lacks discernment.\nOnly when your heart aligns with mine\nDo I dare pour forth my thoughts to you.\n\n**Preface to the Twelve-Character Secret of the Regulated Center Diagram**\n\nThree thousand six hundred methods,\nTens of schools for nurturing life—\nAll are side paths, nothing but crooked trails.\nTake, for instance, breath-holding to inflate the belly,\nThe \"Flying Golden Essence\" behind the elbow,\nAbsorbing and grinding to move the River Chariot,\nBreath retention as the fire-timing,\nInhaling clarity and exhaling turbidity,\nConnecting with realms to channel flows,\nGuiding the turtle and rotating the perch,\nMirroring form to seek transcendence,\nPreserving the top vent,\nGuarding the space between the brows—\nAll are piling heads upon heads,\nCreating affairs where none exist,\nDisordering the sequence,\nDeviating from the utmost truth.\nThus they cause the hundred vessels to seethe,\nThe Three Fields to erupt in chaos,\nHoping for eternal life,\nYet only harming their own.\nThis stems from opposing the harmony of Heaven and Earth,\nFailing to align with the principle of spontaneity.\n\nAfter thirty years of simplifying and reviewing the *Can Tong Qi*,\nI have grasped its mysteries.\nComparing it with other alchemical classics,\nI distilled its essential threads\nTo compose the *Twelve-Character Secret of the Regulated Center Diagram*,\nTransmitting it to those who study the Dao,\nTo rectify the heart and sincerify the will,\nMaking them the central pillar,\nThe axis within that governs the without.\nEight characters serve as auxiliaries,\nRegulating the four seasons,\nResponding from without to within.\nAbove, it harmonizes with the heart of Heaven;\nIn the middle, it examines human affairs;\nSilently conforming to creation,\nFollowing the track of yin and yang,\nExternally modeling the Five Phases,\nInternally ordering the Five Viscera—\nThus it becomes the endless cycle of daily use.\nNo action is taken,\nNo visualization is held.\nIn serene great stability,\nThe primal mechanism is grasped.\nOnly require:\nCutting off desires,\nStilling the heart and qi,\nReducing thoughts,\nModerating diet,\nRegulating breath,\nGuarding against drowsiness,\nRestraining sight and sound,\nNurturing Heaven’s harmony.\nWithin the four dignified postures,\nAlign with spontaneity—\nNo complexity or difficulty exists.\n\nFor those who have established the *yinqie* (silver enclosure),\nThis serves to harmonize with the fire and nurture the sacred embryo.\nFor those who have not yet established the *yinqie*,\nThis strengthens the primal qi,\nNourishes the spirit,\nAnd serves as the gradual foundation for establishing the *yinqie*.\nWhen depletion, loss, or illness assails,\nThis drives away sickness and secures the primal,\nServing as a method for supplementation, longevity,\nAnd the art of nurturing life—\nTruly the simplest of gates!\n\n**The Regulated Center Diagram**\n\nThe \"Regulated Center\" is like dwelling within a compass’s circle—\nNeither inside nor outside,\nNeither clinging to images\nNor attaching to things.\nIt is the center within the body,\nThe center within the mind,\nLike the \"I\" within a great round mirror.\nSimply rectify the heart and sincerify the will,\nMaking them the central pillar.\nWhen all thoughts are extinguished,\nThe true person appears—\nLike a fish dwelling in the deep abyss,\nSwimming freely yet never leaving the square inch.\nThus the true person lurks in the deep abyss,\nFloating and guarding the Regulated Center.\n\nWhen joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have not yet arisen,\nAt this time, one can reside in the Regulated Center,\nFloating and swimming to govern the four seasons,\nRectifying creation.\nWithin the four dignified postures,\nOne must not lose proper measure!\nWhen things come, respond and let them pass,\nThen return to the center—\nBut never disturb the central pillar.\nWithin the center, maintain emptiness,\nNot a speck of dust arises.\nOver time, neither indulgence nor restraint,\nOne naturally attains its benefits.\nIts subtlety lies in:\nThe six yin returning to Kun,\nThe myriad things returning to the origin,\nThe *Fu* hexagram’s first sprouting,\nThe eldest son inheriting the father’s body,\nThe solitary yang stirring in concealment—\nThe time before the myriad things arise.\nAll begins here—\nThis is the point of application.\n\nAt this moment,\nSit cross-legged in great stillness,\nConcentrate the spirit and inwardly illuminate,\nRegulate the breath to be continuous and soft,\nSilently guard it.\nThen the qi arises from the formless,\nVast and obscure,\nWithout color or shape,\nEmerging in the profound darkness,\nThe region of Kun and Gui,\nBorn within the kidneys,\nTo nurture the primal essence,\nSupplement and continue the primal qi,\nUnceasing and unexhausted,\nGrowing stronger day by day.\nFirst, it dispels illness;\nNext, it returns to infancy.\nAccumulated, it becomes the foundation of the inner elixir!\n\nMaster Tuzhen said:\n\"This is the primal qi,\nSupplementing the primal qi—\nHow could it be mere common cinnabar?\"\nThis is the supreme method of supplementation.\n\n**Morning Layering (Zhaotun):**\nThe body of the noble one begins its governance,\nThe first sprouting of the myriad things,\nThe inception of benevolence.\nAt the *zi* hour, the qi of initial generation resides in the kidneys—\nIt comes unbidden, so treasure and nurture it.\nRegulate the breath so the ears do not hear,\nSimply listen to its gentle, continuous flow,\nAligning with spontaneity,\nResonating with the key of Heaven and Earth.\nOver time, kidney qi merges with heart qi,\nThe two qi interact,\nDescending as sweet dew,\nAnd producing the mysterious pearl!\n\n**Evening Enveloping (Mumeng):**\nEnveloping to nurture correctness—\nThe sagely work,\nNot losing the heart of the infant.\nAt the *wu* hour, the qi of initial generation resides in the heart.\nWithout thought or worry,\nStill and unmoving,\nInwardly illuminate in profound silence to unite with it.\nSit in stillness to gather it.\nOver time, heart qi naturally merges with kidney qi,\nAchieving the work of *Jiji* (Completion).\n\nHumans reside within the Three Powers,\nTheir body equaling Heaven and Earth,\nThus their qi corresponds with Heaven and Earth,\nTheir true unity’s essence conforms.\nA person’s primal qi spans eight hundred ten *zhang*,\nResembling the bellows—\nThe great movement of primal qi follows Heaven,\nThe lesser movement follows the sun.\nYet people cannot embody and model Heaven and Earth,\nLeading to severance, damage, and ruin,\nSpirit and essence confused and disordered,\nDeviating from them on their own—\nHow could Heaven and Earth deviate from them?\n\nIf one can follow its principles,\nGrasp its mechanism,\nThen one can align with the work of creation\nAnd engage in the Dao of inner refinement,\nThe path of long life and enduring vision.\nApart from humans, all else is endowed with turbid confusion,\nExisting within the primal qi,\nMerely transformed things—\nHow could they govern the primal qi?\n\nThe *Can Tong Qi* states:\n\"In spring and summer, rely on the inner body,\nFrom *zi* to *chen-si*;\nIn autumn and winter, act externally,\nFrom *wu* to *xu-hai*.\"\nIt also says:\n\"Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn,\nDawn and dusk follow cold and heat.\nThe hexagram lines contain benevolence and righteousness,\nTimely expressing joy and anger.\nThus responding to the four seasons,\nThe Five Phases attain their principles.\"\n\nThus, *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* correspond to spring; *mao*, *chen*, and *si* to summer; *wu*, *wei*, and *shen* to autumn; *you*, *xu*, and *hai* to winter.\n\n*Zi*, *chou*, and *yin* align with spring, when Wood prevails. Wood governs benevolence, the time when the myriad things sprout forth. Hence, the two words *xi* (flourishing) and *he* (harmony) nurture it—*xi* as in the radiant joy of spring’s ascent to the terrace. *He* means beauty: the golden mean penetrating principle, dwelling in its rightful place within the body, flowing through the four limbs, manifesting in one’s undertakings—this is the perfection of beauty. Like an infant not yet able to laugh, crying without hoarseness, this is the perfection of harmony. Unaware of the union of male and female, yet the genitalia stir—this is the perfection of essence.\n\n*Mao*, *chen*, and *si* align with summer, when Fire prevails. Fire governs ritual, the time when the myriad things flourish in order. Thus, the two words *zhong* (centeredness) and *he* (harmony) nurture it. Once harmony is achieved, there is neither excess nor deficiency—this is called *zhong* (the mean). Only then can the emotions and nature roam freely without turbulence.\n\n*Wu*, *wei*, and *shen* align with autumn, when Metal prevails. Metal governs righteousness, the time when grasses and trees yellow and wither, and the myriad things are harvested. Hence, the two words *lian* (restraint) and *jing* (stillness) cultivate it, fulfilling the nature of the myriad things.\n\n*You*, *xu*, and *hai* align with winter, when Water prevails. Water governs wisdom, the time when the myriad things return to their roots and the primal *qi* begins its solemn retreat. Thus, the two words *lian* (restraint) and *su* (solemnity) conceal it, aligning with the *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe *Can Tong Qi* states:\n\"The true person abides in the deep abyss,\nFloating and roaming, guarding the compass within.\"\n\nThe \"true person\" is none other than the one true self: when congealed, it is spirit; when in use, it is the heart; when still, it is nature. Neither moving nor still, empty yet spiritually penetrating—it is also called the true heart. It swims within the compass, within the square and circle of the rules, master of creation, moving without deviation, centered and responsive to the four seasons. Nurtured by trust, it becomes true Earth. Issuing commands and decrees, it nurtures the primal *qi*, governs and cultivates the primal essence, transforming and giving birth to purity. It harmonizes the Five Phases without coercion, thereby connecting the harmony of Heaven and Earth. Thus, rectifying the heart and making the intent sincere, one can achieve impartiality. Only then do *Qian* and *Kun* unite in peace, *Kan* and *Li* intermingle, yin and yang harmonize, and the myriad things flourish. The three luminaries align in proper measure, bringing about great peace. Thereafter, the nation prospers, the people are at ease, and the hundred bones are all in order.\n\n**Explanation of the Pure Yang True Person’s \"Spring in the Garden\"**\n\nThe Pure Yang Perfected’s *Qin Yuan Chun* is a lyric that distills the ultimate principles of the returning elixir, circulated throughout the world. Though many commentaries exist, they often stray into pedantry. How could they know that this bit of immortal method lies not within the three thousand six hundred gates? Thus, one must meet heart with heart, intent with intent. Only when one reaches the delight of this realm does one truly trust that it arises from spontaneity.\n\nOne might say the essential Dao is not complex, the work is easy—freeing oneself from the web of doubts to enter the gate of myriad wonders. I have composed sixteen seven-character quatrains, pairing each with a verse by Master Tongning, totaling twenty pounds in weight, and appended direct annotations to reveal the profound mechanism. May the reader savor them carefully, for grasping one corner reveals all others alike.\n\n*Written in the late spring of the bingyin year of the Xianchun era, by the late learner Yuxizi of Yichun, during the Xiuxi festival.*\n\n**Qinyuan Lyrics**\n\nLifting the topic at hand is the very matter of the Dao-heart.\nHark!\nIn the fine night of clear brightness,\nIn the chaos of the infant’s uncarved state,\nOne finds the delight of the stringless zither—\nNo notes of *gong* or *shang* may outsiders know.\n\nThe sevenfold return of the elixir,\nGold restored to its original nature,\nThis is the sevenfold return,\nAchieving success through earth,\nCalled the ninefold restoration.\nPassion returns to the sea of nature, termed the union,\nThe furnace refines golden radiance, named the return.\nNurtured wholly by the power of true earth,\nRefined into a spirit-body, one emerges from the dusty world.\n\nIn man, the great Dao resides only within the self;\nThe inner elixir must be refined a hundredfold.\nThe Great One divides into three, yet man attains the one;\nThe great medicine is sought only within the body.\nPitiful are the ten thousand thousands,\nWho take all this as mere pleasure and ease.\n\nFirst, refine the self and await the moment.\nRefining the self begins with subduing the heart;\nThe gathering of medicine has its own season.\nTurning the mechanism sets one apart from the vulgar,\nThe heart serene and still as an infant.\nLook closely: creation’s root is no-thing—\nWhen spring arrives in Jiangnan, flowers bloom of themselves.\n\nAt the first stirring of the true yang,\n*Kun* transforms into *Fu*—\nIs this not the heart of heaven and earth revealed?\nSitting in stillness upon the rush mat, thoughts stilled,\nThe spirit’s abode breathes in and out, ever more slowly.\nWarm, misty qi returns to the celestial valley—\nKnow this as the moment when yang begins its return.\n\nIn the deep of night, the water-clock endures;\nMidnight is the hour when the night’s watch feels longest.\nSteaming qi rises, all sounds hushed in clarity—\nWithin the body, winter solstice aligns with the third watch.\nWho can fathom such delight?\nOnly the sound of the bronze clepsydra’s dripping remains.\n\nGently warmed, the lead crucible—\nThe crucible is no metal crucible,\nThe furnace no moon furnace.\n*Li* arises from beneath *Kan*,\n*Dui* resides within the crucible.\nThe jade hare’s decoction boils and surges,\nThe golden furnace’s fire blazes, its light growing bright.\nWho perceives the existence within nothingness?\nWithin lies golden radiance—the foundation of the sage.\n\nLight pierces the curtain,\nThe original spirit generates yang,\nDivine light flickers—\nThe heart in profound stillness illumines inwardly,\nAll returns to the primordial void.\nAt first, the qi is azure, a color yet no-color,\nEmerging from the dragon’s tower to return to the phoenix’s palace.\nBeneath the lapis lazuli screen, candles glow in mutual brilliance,\nBy the river where women bleach silk, the rain has just ceased.\n\nCreation’s pace hastens—\nHusband and wife return to the chamber.\nThe moon reaches the yang palace,\nWithin the waves of peach blossoms,\nDragon and tiger meet.\nRed and black unite, the world cannot guess—\nAll depends on *wu* and *ji* as the matchmaker.\nA full ladle of the marrow of heaven and earth—\nSeek it with intent and drink it in.\n\nThe work of advancing the fire is like treading a perilous path.\nFire arises within water,\nFlowers bloom amid thunder—\nSingle-minded vigilance,\nSteady and skillful.\nWithin the realm of primordial chaos, qi swirls and steams,\nOn the branch of red apricot, spring in its second month.\nBut keep the golden pass firmly sealed—\nThe turning mechanism is the treasure within the house.\n\nBy the winding river, the moon’s radiance gleams still—\nA crow takes flight.\nThe oxherd and weaver girl’s bond,\nThe Dao’s root in tortoise and snake,\nInnately so—\nThe yang crow meets the new moon, uniting in beauty,\nThe two qi mutually sustain and revolve.\nThis is the union of lead and mercury—\nDo not mistake it for the nine bends of the small intestine.\n\nMaster Xiaozhen’s verse says:\nAbove the winding river, the magpie bridge spans,\nThe bond of oxherd and weaver girl—\nThis is the Dao itself.\nThe great medicine, the golden elixir, is born from this.\nIf you doubt, but knock at the *jia-yi* gate,\nThe twin youths will naturally guide you on your way.\nThe *jia-yi* gate is like the *wu-ji* portal.\nWithin this principle lies profound depth,\nBeyond the reach of brush or tongue—\nYet it is merely a matter within the self.\n\nHark!\nTo know the path beneath the mountain,\nAsk those who come and go.\n\nAt that time, one drinks the *daogui* of one’s own accord—\nThe two earths are *wu* and *ji*,\nThe golden blade is lead and mercury.\nDragon coiled, tiger crouched, guarding the center,\n*Li* and *Kan* merge, the light of sun and moon.\nAfter drinking, one awakens and returns to the grotto palace—\nThe flowery pond, lush with lotus fragrance.\n\nWho would believe a child is nurtured within nothingness?\nWithin the body, yin and yang;\nWithin the pot, sun and moon—\nAll immortals and sages,\nOriginally no different.\nIf not one of those within,\nHow could I explain it to you?\n\nRefine essence to nurture the spiritual root,\nRefine qi to nurture the spirit—\nLead and mercury transform and nourish the true body.\nSuddenly, one pierces through the mud-pill palace—\nOnly then does one trust that immortals do not deceive.\n\nDiscern the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source,\nThe separation of wood and metal—\nWithout a teacher’s guidance,\nThis matter is hard to know.\nLead sinks, silver floats—\nThe clear above, the turbid below.\nThe clear is golden radiance,\nThe turbid is lead’s essence.\nTo unite golden radiance with the liquid of wood—\nThis is the wondrous method of employing lead.\nWhen the two meet, passion and nature merge;\nWhen the millet pearl forms, wood and metal separate.\nWithout a teacher’s guidance,\nThis matter is hard to know.\n\nThe clear and turbid, sinking and floating, share a single source—\nTo take the clear and discard the turbid is even more profound.\nThe merging and separation must be distinguished—\nThe wonder lies in a single word from a true teacher.\n\nThe Dao is subtle and mysterious,\nThe celestial mechanism deep and distant—\nBegin practice swiftly, for time is fleeting.\nOnly when one reaches the point of shame\nDoes one know one’s skill is not yet refined.\n\nAs Master Baiyun said:\nThose who slander it are like grasping a giant melon stem to sweep Mount Kunlun;\nThose who savor it are like swans and cranes drinking from the vast sea.\nThe views of the well-frog and fence-sparrow—\nHow could they know the vastness of sea and sky?\n\nDiligence without encounter—\nOne must encounter it;\nEncountering it without refinement is still folly.\nCherish each moment,\nDo not let time pass in vain.\nAwaken swiftly,\nPractice urgently—\nWhen will the precious pearl in hand shine clear?\nIf the hut is ruined, how can it be rebuilt?\n\nWithin the millet pearl, the world is vast—\nThe immortal true ones surge within.\nHow many gaze in vain,\nSighing at the heavens’ height, deeming it unattainable?\n\nMaster Changchun’s verse says:\nSun and moon swiftly fly overhead,\nTime swiftly passes before one’s eyes.\nTurning to look back, one is already old—\nTo begin practice swiftly is still too late.\n\nDuring the Shaoxing era, in the southern part of Yichun, the household of Prefect Wei of the Wei clan harbored many secrets. One day, an extraordinary person entered directly into his study and called out, \"Prefect Wei, come forth for a word.\" At the time, Wei was napping during the day, and his attendants dared not announce the visitor. The stranger left a *ci* poem on the wall before departing, titled *Sumuzhe*. When Wei awoke and saw it, he deeply regretted the missed encounter and sent men to search, but the visitor could not be found. The poem read:\n\nWithin the waters, gold aligns with Ox and Dipper,\nJade locks and golden gates,\nGuarded by divine youths of the Dharma.\nRed River’s cinnabar terrace—\nDragons and tigers roam,\nMyriad forms in solemn array,\nVigorously casting forth the pearl.\n\nDrink from the numinous spring, refine the fire’s timing,\nThe Great One’s furnace opens,\nThe elixir ripens, divine radiance pierces through.\nFleeting fame and profit soon fade—\nSwiftly begin practice,\nExhaust the \"nothing\" to attain the \"something.\"\nThe path to Penglai—\nRely on three thousand deeds fulfilled,\nThen stride alone upon the clouds to return.\n\nThe *Scripture of the August Void* states: \"Those who wish to cultivate the Dao must first establish merit. Thus, the Celestial Emperors of the heavens, the exalted Heavenly Emperors, the Perfected of the heavens, and the Divine Immortals of the heavens all ascend to the sagely and perfected ranks through meritorious deeds. The heavens record merit, and worldly scholars who cultivate the true resolve, once their merit is complete and virtue perfected, shed the mortal to become immortals, transform from immortals to Perfected, and the Perfected attain boundless freedom, merging with spontaneity. When dissolved, they become qi; when at rest, they become human. With spiritual penetrations and self-mastery, they transform without form, soar through the Three Realms, and traverse the hidden and obscure. Cultivators must first cherish essence and treasure qi, anchor the mind and concentrate spirit, establishing the foundation for nurturing the elixir. Then, entering seclusion for three thousand days, the inner work must not be the slightest bit deficient, until the embryo is fully formed, transcending to the primordial origin. Yet external conduct is also essential to accord with the Dao of Heaven. Thus, merit cannot be too abundant, and conduct cannot be too broad. With three thousand merits fulfilled, one becomes an immortal of the Great Veil; with three thousand deeds of conduct fulfilled, one becomes a guest of the Great Veil.\"\n\nMaster Zhongli said: \"Merit without conduct is like having no feet; conduct without merit leaves the feet unable to advance. Only with both merit and conduct complete are the feet fully prepared—who then can say one has no share in becoming a divine immortal?\"\n\nMoreover, those who cultivate the Dao and attain the Way first dwell in Penglai, Fangzhang, or Yingzhou, becoming unbound immortals. The Primordial Sovereign of the Great One then summons them to receive the chart, their names inscribed in the immortal register, ascending step by step to the sagely ranks, paying court to the Jade Emperor, and receiving the title of Perfected. They must further guide and transform later generations, universally practicing and enlightening, until reaching the state of \"no cultivation, no attainment,\" which is called spontaneity.\n\nA poem by a High Perfected reads:\nIn the tenth month, the fire’s timing is cast aside,\nThe inner work’s hours have reached three thousand.\nFurther relying on external conduct to accord with Heaven’s Dao,\nOne transcends the primordial origin to verify the Upper Immortal.\n\nWhen Master Quanzhen Wang and Zhang attained the Dao, they composed the *Ci of Untying the Girdle*, which says:\nCultivators,\nTheir meritorious efforts are no small matter,\nDiscerning the reversal and inversion of the five phases,\nThe wondrous principle is profoundly abstruse.\nWithin the jade furnace, dragons coil and tigers crouch,\nIn the golden tripod, the supreme treasure is refined.\nThe yang spirit departs the body,\nVast and obscure,\nIn an instant, it roams the three isles.\nOnce entry and exit are mastered,\nRestrain and hold fast,\nSeek further mysteries,\nMerge with true emptiness—\nThe Great Void is the culmination.\n\nFive Esoteric Poems:\n\n*Hiss and blow*—three feet, yet no trace,\nRelease and gather, swift as the wind.\nAmong a hundred thousand, select one or two,\nTo entrust this Dao to you.\n\nThe second:\nExtended like lightning, round as the moon,\nNot for men—do not draw near.\nTo verify Buddhahood or attain Perfection, this is needed,\nThese subtle wonders require a master.\n\nThe third:\nCutting nails and severing iron, cleaving delusion,\nThe wondrous function, freely applied, comes from the master.\nReturning at will, filling the sleeves,\nCaress and nurture it as a grandson.\n\nThe fourth:\nRadiance blazing, pressing upon the body,\nBones tremble, hair stands on end—what to do?\nIf you are truly a man, you will not fear,\nWith one stroke, the truth is revealed at once.\n\nThe fifth:\nAmong a hundred thousand, one or two,\nWith one stroke, it must align with the sages’ minds.\nThe red youth manifests numinous auspices,\nWithered wood blooms, iron turns to gold.\n\nIn Praise of the Immortal of Pure Yang:\n\nSupreme virtue defies naming,\nPrimordial merit does not govern—\nWhat need for gathas or praises?\nHeaven is impartial,\nOnly virtue is aided,\nThe sagely teacher is never far.\n\nPhoenix-like bearing, a spirit of the age,\nA true Confucian of the moon’s visage and dragon beard,\nA scion of Tang officials.\nAwakened by the Yellow Millet Dream,\nHe severed the endless cycle of life and death.\nOnce the elixir was formed, he sought only to deliver others,\nHis rank exalted, ever aiding the drowning.\n\nIn the southern lands, he refined gold lead and wood mercury;\nIn Bianjing, he savored the jade nectar of Suka.\nWhen he manifested as Quanzhen,\nCountless living beings relied on his grace.\nWielding three swords as admonitions,\nHe nurtured hundreds and thousands of disciples with love.\n\nAt times, white duckweed and red reeds;\nAt times, the Purple Palace and Clear Capital.\nLetting go of all, he beheld the Great Void,\nYet still stood in attendance at the Hall of Luminous Understanding.\n\nThe realm revered his noble demeanor,\nThe world witnessed his numinous traces.\nMaster Guo on the turtle’s back longed to return—\nThe master spoke of himself thus.\nDaoist Peng still awaited enlightenment—\nThis was Peng Chongyang.\n\nFor kalpas, I have been foolish and deluded,\nEntangled in habitual tendencies.\nSince gaining discernment,\nI have never measured my strength,\nIndulging in every inclination—\nOnly the Dao of immortals and Buddhas\nHave I not yet inquired into.\n\nMy senior, Yue Junsucan of Changsha’s official lineage, shared my passion,\nAnd we became friends despite the difference in age.\nI knew he was a dharma companion of Peng Chongyang and Hu Gucan,\nAll three having received the oral transmission of the Golden Elixir from Master Yuxi.\nOne day, as we conversed, I broached the subject,\nAnd he spoke with fervor, recounting his lifelong quest for friends and teachers,\nSparing neither body nor life.\nLater, he encountered Master Yuxi, who said,\n\"Our past friendship was but casual discourse and miscellaneous discussions.\nThe time for learning the Dao has its own season and cause.\nNow that you have reached this point, the time is ripe!\"\nHe bade me wait for an auspicious day to transmit the teachings.\nThus, in the *chen* hour of the *jiazi* day,\nHe secretly imparted a few words,\nAnd I tentatively practiced.\nWithin a month, the elixir’s efficacy was verified—\nThe so-called golden radiance suffusing the body,\nJasper towers and crimson palaces,\nDragon and tiger, infant and maiden,\nAll fleetingly appearing in vision.\nWhen Yue heard of this, he sighed, wiping away tears:\n\"Since I first heard the Dao,\nMy body and temperament have been afflicted,\nUnable to settle my steps.\nThus, in the work of advancing the fire, I have yet to begin.\"\n\nThe child has long possessed the bone of an immortal—this is no trifling matter. I dare not presume to be your master. Instead, I shall point you to one among them who bears an uncanny resemblance to Master Yuxi. Simply clothe him in robes and cap to capture the likeness of the master, and take him as your teacher. I hereby entrust to you all of the master’s handwritten manuscripts and these ten volumes, with solemn injunctions.\n\nLater, I heard from the modestly learned steward Shu Zongguan: \"The master once served in my family. When my father, the Pacification Commissioner, completed his term, we traveled together back to Huai. The master lodged and dined in the kitchen boat, which was tethered to the stern of our vessel with an iron chain. As we neared Zhenzhou, suddenly a great storm arose, and the iron chain snapped. The kitchen boat, with all its people and belongings, was swallowed by the surging waves. Two days later, the master arrived at Yangzi Bridge, clutching a small bundle of clothes. As our boat was being woven together anew, he bid farewell to my father in person and departed. Only then did we realize the master had attained the Dao of entering water without drowning. The Gao family sighed in awe without end.\"\n\nSince receiving the transmission, fifty-five years have passed, and now I have reached ninety. I have labored to depict the immortal’s likeness at the end of the preface to these ten volumes and have had them engraved to ensure their wide circulation.\n\nOn a certain day and month in the fourteenth year of the Zhizheng era, Wang Gui Junzhang of Zhongyang, with incense burning, respectfully inscribed this.\n\n*Concluding the Lower Scroll of* Essential Pointers to the Alchemical Canon *of Master Yuxi*",

      "translated_text": "Having sought him out further, he could no longer be found. Upon meeting Lan, he recounted all that had been said. Lan asked, “Did the man between his brows bear a white mole?” He replied, “Yes.” Lan said, “That was Liu Haichan. I have nurtured the sacred embryo, yet without him, I could not have attained fruition.”\n\nHe then repeated the message for Lan: “The Recluse Liu sends his regards to the Master: ‘How does one emerge from the ten-month gestation?’” Lan clapped his hands and laughed heartily. Suddenly, a rumbling like thunder resounded from above, and a figure radiant as snow and moonlight—indistinguishable from Lan—ascended straight into the heavens, while Lan had already departed. My forebear burned incense, sighed, and withdrew. Today, he is known as the “Master of Eternal Laughter” of Yue Mountain. See *Records of Our Family’s Extraordinary Encounters* and *The Annals of Yichun*.\n\nUpon returning home, he gathered hagiographies of immortals, Daoist scriptures, and various philosophical texts, shutting his door to visitors and poring over them day and night. Before long, he too passed away without illness. His *Collection for Manifesting the Ancestors* circulates in the world. I am his descendant, having studied the Confucian classics in youth. Though I did not achieve my ambitions, I devoted myself to the canons of Daoism and Buddhism, as well as astronomy, mathematics, medicine, and divination. Yet of all these, the elixir of golden cinnabar captivated me most.\n\nThus, I traversed rivers and lakes, journeyed across mountains and plains, and even bowed to beggars to seek their counsel. Unwavering in my resolve, Heaven guided my steps, and I encountered a perfected one within the Temple of Prince Wang in Guixian Alley, and later again in Jiangling Prefecture. A single word of instruction awakened me to the essence of the seven reversals and nine refinements.\n\nI once sojourned on Mount Wudang, and along the Xiang and Han rivers, the Jiang and Huai—no place I did not visit. Yet few I met were enlightened or possessed the round mechanism of Dao, so I sealed my lips and spoke not a word of the Mystery. By the *guihai* year of the Jingding era (1263), traveling from Jingxiang to Xingsha, my homeland was not far. There, I met old acquaintances from my village, and in conversation, learned that the strong had grown old, and the old had passed away. Unbidden, tears flowed, and I reflected: The Perfected of Purple Yang had said, “To plan for oneself is to succeed.” To sever the bonds of Heaven’s Dao is the gravest transgression.\n\nThereupon, I opened my heart in prayer to Heaven and, assembling the golden key and jade lock, composed *Essential Pointers on the Awakening to Reality*, *The Book of Longevity and Everlasting Vision*, *On Dispelling Delusion*, and *Dialogues on the Dharma*. Fearing the symbolic imagery remained incomplete, I further elucidated the workings of the Primordial Sovereign to clarify the advance and retreat of tally and fire—truly, I have revealed Heaven’s secrets. Those who aspire to the Dao must cherish this. My hope is that all may cultivate and refine themselves, each attaining perfection, fulfilling their virtue and completing their merit, to together realize the fruit of immortality. Should any treat this lightly, calamity will swiftly manifest. The language herein is plain, yet it conveys the true matters of the inner chamber. Noble seekers of the Dao, ponder it deeply. If enlightenment comes, it is Heaven’s gift, not through my humble oral transmission.\n\nWritten on the full moon of the fourth month in the *jiazi* year of the fifth Jingding era (1264), by Li Jianyi of Yuxi, Yichun.\n\n**Preface to *Essential Pointers on the Alchemical Canon* (Volume One)**\nCompiled by Li Jianyi of Yuxi",

      "translated_text": "**Essential Pointers on *Awakening to Reality*: The Diagrams**\n\n**The Three-Five Unification Diagram**\n**1. The Nine Returns and Seven Reversions**\n\"Returns\" and \"reversions\" signify the principle of inversion—merely the cyclical interplay of metal and fire. Master Ziyang states:\n*\"Seven reversions: cinnabar returns to its root;\nNine returns: golden liquor reverts to truth.\nDo not fixate on the reckoning of *yin* and *zi*;\nSimply observe the five phases as your standard.\"*\nMetal’s number is four; multiplied by earth, it becomes nine returns.\nFire’s number is two; multiplied by earth, it becomes seven reversions.\nThe *Triple Concordance Canon* speaks of the \"secret in lead and fire\"—this is the Golden Elixir, the Golden Elixir is the divine water of the Flowery Pond.\nThe *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* states: *\"No alchemical art is more luminous than metal and fire.\"*\nIt further says:\n*\"Within the divine chamber, essence is refined;\nFire and metal mutually propel.\nThe male yang is the azure water of mystery;\nThe female yin is the ochre gold.\"*\nThe *Canon* declares:\n*\"Pound, refine, and conjoin them,\nThen bear them into the vermilion gate.\"*\nThe esoteric essence lies therein.\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"The White Tiger’s primary scripture is the supreme treasure;\nThe Flowery Pond’s divine water is true gold.\"*\nNow, I elucidate this directly, hoping to awaken understanding.\nMetal is true lead; fire is divine mercury.\nTrue lead is the primordial *qi*, born from the kidneys—thus the alchemical canons proclaim: *\"How sublime! True lead, the forerunner of heaven and earth.\"*\nDivine mercury is the true nature within the heart.\nThe *qi* within the kidneys conceals true water;\nThe true nature within the heart stores true fire.\nMaster Shi states:\n*\"The medicine is drawn from the primordial *qi*;\nThe fire is sought in the essence of the great yang.\nIf one knows how to gather the medicine and seek the fire,\nWithin the cauldron, the elixir will surely form.\"*\nWithout true earth, they cannot unite.\nThus, the return and reversion of metal and fire are the paramount essentials of the inner elixir. Seek them within the body—beyond this, all is not the Dao.\n\n**2. The Crucible**\nThe crucible is the yang furnace and yin tripod, the jade furnace and golden cauldron. It is also called the divine chamber, the upper and lower cauldrons, the yellow chamber, the recumbent moon furnace, the *kan*-*li* enclosure, or the Mysterious Pass—a single aperture with countless names.\nThis is the pivot of the returning elixir, the repository where spirit and *qi* converge and are stored.\nIn truth, there are two:\nOne is the inner crucible and divine furnace;\nThe other is the outer crucible and its symbolic representation.\nWithin the body, it lies at the central axis, aligned with the navel in front and the kidneys behind. When lead and mercury merge, a single point descends into this place.\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"To ensure the Valley Spirit never dies,\nRely on the Mysterious Female to establish the foundation.\nOnce true essence returns to the golden chamber,\nA luminous pearl will never depart.\"*\nThis is what is meant by \"establishing the foundation in a hundred days.\"\nThe outer crucible’s symbolic representation follows the principles of yin and yang: water above, fire below. It observes the waxing and waning of the moon, aligns with the eight trigrams and four seasons, manipulates the five phases, harmonizes the four images, refines dragon and tiger, restrains hun and po, and ensures inner and outer correspondence through inversion, ascent, and descent.\nHeaven and earth serve as parents;\n*Kan* and *li* as husband and wife.\nDividing the 384 lines, one circulates the fire phases;\nMoving the five stars and twenty-eight constellations, they encircle the crucible.\nSealed and fortified, not a moment’s deviation is permitted.\nMaster Ziyang states:\n*\"First take heaven and earth as your crucible;\nThen gather the crow and hare to refine the medicine.\nOnce you drive these two into the Yellow Path,\nHow could the Golden Elixir fail to form?\"*\nAnother verse from the *Canon* says:\n*\"Cultivate and nourish the capital;\nCongeal the spirit to form the body.\"*\nIt further states:\n*\"The true person lurks in the deep abyss,\nFloating and wandering within the compass.\"*\nThis is the Mysterious Pass.\nThe inner and outer crucibles, with their symbolic representations, are thus clearly expounded.\nIf one seeks externally or clings to lust, desire, or delusion, attempting to fabricate in the realm of form, they will be separated by ten thousand miles.\n\n**3. True Lead**\nTrue lead is the *kan* male, the infant, the lunar essence, the yin tiger, the metal lord, the silver within lead, the white within black, the yang within yin. Though its names are many, it is called true lead—yet in truth, it is the primordial unity of *qi*, gathered before the Great Simplicity.\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"Simply capture the earth’s *po* to subdue the vermilion mercury.\"*\nIt meets true mercury to form the elixir and is governed by true earth.\n\n**4. True Mercury**\nTrue mercury is the *li* female, the solar essence, the radiant maiden, the yang dragon, the mercury within cinnabar, the female within the male, the yin within yang. Though its names are many, it is called true mercury—yet in truth, it is merely the liquid of wood.\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"Naturally, the celestial soul restrains the water-metal.\"*\nIt meets true lead to form the elixir and is governed by true earth.\n\n**5. True Earth**\nTrue earth is *wu*-*ji*, the central palace, the *kun* palace—it is not the spleen. When lead is cast into mercury, without true earth, they cannot fuse and congeal. It wields the sword and inverts the spear to stabilize the four directions.\nThe *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* states:\n*\"The four seas converge like spokes to a hub,\nEstablishing great peace—all through the virtue of earth in the central palace,\nThe achievement of the Yellow Emperor.\"*\nThe *Canon* says:\n*\"The three substances form one household,\nAll returning to *wu*-*ji*.\"*\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"Send them back to the earthen cauldron, firmly sealed.\"*\nAs the linchpin of metal, wood, water, and fire, the work of the five phases is complete.\n\n**6. The Knife and Scepter**\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"If *li* and *kan* lack *wu*-*ji*,\nThough they contain the four images, the elixir will not form.\nOnly when both embrace true earth\nCan the Golden Elixir return.\"*\nMaster Yu states:\n*\"The great medicine never departs from true *wu*-*ji*;\nThus, the immortals call it ‘a knife and scepter.’\"*\nThe knife is a metaphor for metal; the scepter, for the two earths. To \"drink the knife and scepter\" is to flow *wu* into *ji*.\nMaster Shi says:\n*\"To know when lead and mercury unite,\nYou may then drink the knife and scepter.\"*\nThe *Restoration of Life* states:\n*\"When dragon and tiger embrace in mutual longing,\n*Kan* and *li* unite to form the embryo.\nA single handful of the marrow of heaven and earth—\nWith intent, seek and seize it.\"*",

      "translated_text": "At that very moment, one drinks the knife and scepter.\n\n**2. The Matchmaker**\nThe matchmaker is a metaphor for union. To cast lead and merge with mercury, none but the matchmaker will suffice—this is the Yellow Dame. Yet she is not the spleen.\n\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"If true lead is to retain mercury,\nThe minister must never leave the sovereign’s side.\nWhen wood and metal stand apart without cause,\nOnly the matchmaker can draw them together.\"*\nThis, too, is the meaning of flowing *wu* into *ji*.\n\n**3. Gathering and Seizing**\nTo gather is to gather without gathering; to seize is to seize without seizing. It cannot be sought with intent, nor attained without it.\n\nMaster Shao states:\n*\"At winter solstice’s midnight,\nThe heart of heaven remains unchanged.\nWhere the first yang stirs,\nBefore the ten thousand things arise—*\nHere lies the point of action.\"\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"The Dao of Qian becomes male;\nThe Dao of Kun becomes female.\"*\nThus, a man at sixteen is filled with true essence, corresponding to Qian; a woman at fourteen receives celestial water, corresponding to Kun. Qian embraces *jia* and *ren*; Kun embraces *yi* and *gui*—such is the origin of creation.\n\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"When lead meets *gui*, gather swiftly.\"*\nThis is the end of Kun and the beginning of *Fu*, before the Great Simplicity’s qi appears. Wait for the first yang to stir, then gather without delay. *\"Gold, when distant, is unfit to taste\"*—lest the delicate blossom scatter carelessly.\n\nMaster *Fuming* of *Restoration* says:\n*\"Gathering must be secret,\nWith sincere heart, discern beauty from ugliness.\nThe thread of intent is hard to trace—\nLose it, and the cold spring slips away.\"*\n\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"Knock the bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow the jade mushroom;\nPluck the zither to call the phoenix to drink the knife and scepter.\"*\nThis is the pivotal mechanism for drawing lead into the crucible—far from the art of \"refining gold through the jade woman.\"\n\n**4. Fusion and Coagulation**\nAn ancient song says:\n*\"The sun is *Li*, the moon is *Kan*;\nTheir essences devour each other.\"*\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"The two things arise from the child producing the mother;\nThe five phases must all enter the Central Palace.\"*\nThis is the five stars strung like pearls, the sun and moon conjoined as one.\n\nThe late Master Ma Danyang said:\n*\"Fire arises in water—banish the heart’s scenery;\nFlowers bloom in snow—extinguish the spring of intent.\"*\nSuch is the scene of fusion and coagulation. Those who study the Dao should savor it deeply!\n\n**5. Refining and Smelting**\nThe *Triplex Unity* states:\n*\"Below lies the qi of Great Yang,\nSteaming in but a moment.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Rising and roasting upon the mountain of rice,\nThe blazing fire is set below.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The wailing cries are most sorrowful,\nLike an infant longing for its mother.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"When Mars guards the west and Venus traverses the sky,\nWherever the killing qi descends, what does not topple?\nThe fox guards the mouse; the sparrow fears the crane.\"*\n\n*Restoration* says:\n*\"Having seized the essence and marrow of crow and hare,\nHasten to gather and smelt it within the crucible.\"*\n\nAn ancient song says:\n*\"The divine fire refines the lead’s qi by night,\nThe old turtle devours the soul of the Fire Spirit.\"*\nThis is the principle of natural refining and smelting. Those who do not understand creation should not lightly discuss it.\n\n**6. The Union of Metal and Wood**\nMetal is the sentiment of lead; wood is the nature of mercury. In the profound and indistinct, it defies description.\n\nMetal within the body is firm, strong, and pure, coursing through the four limbs—this is metal’s true sentiment, not the sentiment of desire. Wood within the interior is soft, yielding, and compassionate, like sweating at the croak of a frog—this is wood’s true nature, the very root of benevolence.\n\nMetal’s sentiment grows through lead; wood’s nature congeals through mercury. When lead and mercury unite, their congealing and nurturing cause sentiment and nature to long for each other. As the *True Unity Master* says: *\"The male’s sentiment and the female’s nature, mutually seeking and containing, gather to generate and transform true essence into the divine medicine.\"*\n\nMaster Ziyang says:\n*\"Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness;\nMetal’s sentiment cherishes wood’s kindness.\nDevouring each other, they grow intimate—\nOnly then does the man conceive.\"*\n\nThe *Triplex Unity* says:\n*\"When metal returns to its original nature,\nIt may be called the Returned Elixir.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Metal fells wood, yet wood flourishes.\"*\nWithout the matchmaker’s harmony, there would be the peril of separation.\n\n**7. The Clarity and Turbidity of the Water Source**\nThe water source is a metaphor for the heart’s source and the sea of nature. When the dragon coils and the tiger crouches, clouds disperse and mists clear—this is called the waves of the sea of desire stilled, the surges of the river of love ceased. In stillness, heaven and earth are vast; in leisure, the sun and moon are long.\n\nWhether turbid or clear, it will be seen in due time.\n\n**8. Warm Nurturing**",

      "translated_text": "To eliminate passions and dispel desires, withdraw the gaze and reverse hearing, abandon the limbs, dull the senses, and remain foolish all day—this must not be departed from even for a moment. Like a dragon nurturing its pearl, allow no interruption; like a hen brooding her eggs, keep the warmth unbroken.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Concentrate your qi to attain suppleness—can you be like an infant?\"* And: *\"Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish.\"*\n\nThe secret says: *\"Forget the form to nurture qi, forget qi to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture emptiness.\"* The true person guards the center, and qi is like spring within the flower. When the seasonal cycle is complete, the embryo sheds its form, and spirit transforms.\n\n**9. Fire and Timing**\nFire is the fire of spirit; timing is the alignment of signs. Model the cauldron and furnace on heaven and earth, use yang as charcoal, yin as water. As the sun and moon move, there is cold and heat. The central sovereign issues commands, carefully regulating and harmonizing. Though the numinous medicine is formless, it can subtly follow the mechanism of transformation, ascending and descending in reversal.\n\nMaster Cao said: *\"When the qi of Li is reached in a hundred moments, cinnabar emerges from it.\"* There are rhythms of withdrawal and addition, advance and retreat, bathing—if even a hair’s breadth is amiss, regret and misfortune arise at once.\n\nMaster Ziyang said: *\"Even if you recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the fire and timing, it is as if idle. All depends on the power of maintenance—if even a hair’s breadth is amiss, the elixir will not form.\"* This is a matter of heavenly mechanism, not to be lightly discussed. The general meaning has already been seen in the works of Fuxi. The wise, reflecting nine times daily, will naturally awaken.\n\nOf old, Lord Laozi’s *Twelve Secret Verses on the Fire and Timing of the Golden Elixir* were recorded as follows:\n\nThe secret says:\n*\"Sun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun,\nThe hexagrams cycle in clear sequence.\nFrom Kun’s end to Fu’s beginning, like tracing a linked ring.\nThree-five before, three-five after—these are the waxing and waning crescents.\nFive-six makes thirty, returning to life—this is the monthly seasonal node.\nBorn and extinguished, cycling through twelve—this is the yearly seasonal node.\nTwelve divided into twenty-four—\nThe twenty-four qi complete the fire and timing of a year.\nThe twenty-four qi mutually shift and change, cycling endlessly.\nAll phenomena, every ounce and grain, are contained herein.\nMercury, one flavor divided into two, transforms into yin and yang.\nOnce transformed, they reunite as husband and wife—\nOnly then does one perceive heaven and earth within the crucible.\"*\n\nThese verses were spoken by the golden mouth of the Most High, revealing the subtlest principles of medicinal substances and fire timing. They are decreed for later learners of the Dao, who should treat them with reverence. If treated with disdain, calamity will swiftly follow—everywhere, divine spirits are present! One cannot be careless.\n\nMaster Pure Yang’s postscript says: *\"Great indeed are the twelve verses, harmonizing with the Five Thousand Words.\"*\n\n**10. Bathing**\nThe *Triplex Unity* says: *\"In the second month, the elm dies; in the eighth month, the wheat sprouts. When punishment and virtue approach the gate, beware of danger.\"*\n\nMaster Ziyang said: *\"In the months of the hare and rooster, when the time arrives and the signs of punishment and virtue approach, this is when the golden cinnabar should be bathed. If fire is added instead, peril will surely follow.\"* Thus, during the hours of Mao and You, one should bathe to balance them, not advance the fire timing.\n\n**11. Shedding the Embryo**\nGradually growing larger, gradually becoming numinous, gradually forming.\n\nMaster Ziyang said: *\"Fruit on the branch will ripen in time—how is the child in the womb any different?\"*\n\nMaster Yunfang said: *\"The child is young and not yet grown; it must rely on the nurturing kindness of father and mother. After nine years and three years, worldly affairs are exhausted—then it may roam heaven and earth, no longer bound to its parents.\"* Looking back at the old body, it is but a heap of dung and dirt. When merit is complete and the fruit is full, one ascends to pay homage to the Primordial Sovereign. This may be called *\"form and spirit both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth.\"*\n\nThe *Song of Breaking Delusion* by the Perfected of Great Unity says:\n*\"By the roadside, you meet a fish, still flicking its red tail—\nIf you wish to save it, quickly return it to the water’s depths.\nOn the path, you meet a person whose life is slipping away—\nIf you wish to save them, swiftly give them the Dao’s principle.\nSide doors and minor methods have a thousand strands and ten thousand threads,\nBut the true Dao’s affairs are not many—they do not extend beyond oneself.\"*\n\nTo save those lost in delusion, I briefly present one or two:\n*\"Circulating qi is not the Dao—breathing disrupts the constructive and defensive.\nSwallowing saliva is not the Dao—saliva is not the water of spirit.\nVisualization is not the Dao—painting cakes cannot serve as food.\nAbsorbing yin is not the Dao—when essence is exhausted, life follows in death.\nAvoiding salt is not the Dao—food will lack savor.\nFasting is not the Dao—hunger and emaciation harm the intestines and stomach.\nAbandoning one’s wife is not the Dao—yin and yang lose their proper positions.\"*\n\nWhat, then, is the Dao?\n*\"The Great Unity contains true qi—\nQi intermingles yet does not intermingle, ascending and descending in imitation of heaven and earth.\nTwo things unite in harmony, arising from the primordial beginning.\nThe marvelous maiden and the infant boy, matched to achieve completion.\nThese are true yin and yang—husband and wife share one principle.\nThus, there is no need to abandon—how can solitary yang accomplish anything?\nThis is revealed to be the way of immortals—how could the golden elixir be easy?\nThe steadfast scholar does not speak of truth; the Great Cavern conceals profound meaning.\nThe five phases do not proceed in order—tigers are born in water.\nThe art of inverting the five phases—dragons emerge from fire.\nThese words are truly wondrous—they are the power of the Great Unity.\"*\n\nMaster Ziyang said: *\"Abandoning one’s wife cuts off yin and yang; fasting merely leaves the intestines and stomach empty.\"* He cited the words of the *Song of Breaking Delusion* by the Perfected of Great Unity. While fasting is not the ultimate Dao, the principle behind abandoning one’s wife is profound.\n\nIn this world, those bound for hell, upon seeing Ziyang’s words, hastily annotate them with the *Three Peaks of Golden Flower* and the arts of bedroom cultivation, misleading later generations and casting scholars and gentlemen into hell. They fail to understand that the intent of the Perfected of Great Unity and Master Ziyang refers to the union of true yin and true yang within the body.\n\nThus, the *Triplex Unity* says: *\"The male does not dwell alone; the female does not live in solitude.\"* And: *\"Things without yin and yang violate heaven and turn against the primordial. A rooster hatching eggs alone will not produce complete chicks.\"*",

Should you persist in greed without restraint, you will inevitably meet ruin and disgrace.\"* This discourse guards against peril and contemplates danger—it is the pivot of reversal.\n\nIf the mind clings to sensual desire and the fire of lust burns below, the Great Treasure will be lost, the foundation of life will crumble. When that time comes, how can regret avail?\n\nI write this again to warn those who study the Dao: may all tread the true path together, ascend the immortal ranks as one, and guide those who come after. Let not the blind lead the blind.\n\nThe *Song of Flowing Pearls* by Immortal Ge Xian says:\n*\"Flowing pearl, flowing pearl,\nCast to me, so earnest and small.\nWandering the four seas, traversing ten thousand scrolls,\nRestless, tireless—forgetting sleep and food.\nI sought counsel from all friends, burned cinnabar to ash.\nFor thirty years, each day I sighed in longing.\nNow at sixty, I fear descending the Three Wretched Realms.\nBy my teacher’s transmission, I grasped the primordial qi of emptiness and nothingness.\nFirst, stabilize the golden crucible; then, the jade furnace.\nThe fire of Li stirs; the water of Kan takes form.\nJade nectar irrigates, flowing suet fills the chamber of the Grotto.\nThe Perfected One ferries me—only the great man shall pass.\nHold this in mind, entrust this to memory.\"*\n\nFrom this, we see that the ancients who studied the Dao did so with utmost diligence—none failed to meet a perfected being who enlightened them.\n\nThe path of internal elixir refinement employs no more than lead and mercury as its ingredients. First, cultivate the human Dao, taking loyalty and filial piety as the foundation, and aiding others as the priority. Treasure this body, harmonizing inner practice with outer conduct. Eliminate cravings, stabilize the mind and qi, moderate diet, and reduce sleep.\n\nThe supreme medicines within the body are essence, qi, and spirit.

      "translated_text": "Master Li Jianyi of Jade Creek compiled this *Book of Longevity and Everlasting Vision*. The *Yellow Emperor’s Hidden Talisman Classic* states: \"Above lies the Dao of immortals embracing the One; in the middle, the methods for enriching the state and pacifying the people; below, the arts of strengthening the army and securing victory.\" Its three sections unfold in mere hundreds of words—its text profound and recondite, its Dao deep and subtle. Though commentaries abound, interpretations vary. In ancient times, the Perfected One of Huayang transmitted the Dao to the Perfected One Yang in the valley, concealing its essence in three precepts, all pertaining to the arcane principles of inner refinement. Master Jade Creek explored its subtleties, elucidated its chapters and meanings, and thus composed the *Book of Longevity and Everlasting Vision*.\n\nNow, the design of the human body mirrors the image of a state: the heart serves as sovereign, essence and qi as the people. To empty the heart and house the spirit is to nurture one’s nature; to cherish essence and treasure qi is to nurture one’s life. When essence and qi are firmly established, the spirit does not wander recklessly. Naturally, blood and qi flow unimpeded, constructive and defensive energies harmonize, the five viscera and six bowels, the four limbs and three barriers, the twelve hundred numinous spirits and twelve thousand deities—all encircle the body, silently serving as its guardians and sovereigns. By exhausting the meaning of the *Hidden Talisman Classic*, practicing the teachings of purity and quiescence, shutting out the allure of the ears and eyes, forsaking the desires of the mouth and belly, establishing the Five Constants to govern the framework, and deploying the Seven Governances to oversee the myriad spirits—with the sovereign abiding in the Central Palace, none dare indulge in excess—one draws upon oneself and attends to the root of the body. Weeding and tilling, one cultivates the fertile ground. Thus, purple mushrooms sprout in the cinnabar field, yellow sprouts grow in the mysterious garden, the numinous terrace and spirit chamber become golden bodies and jade flowers, the inner gardens and Penglai Isles bear intertwining pears and fiery jujubes. The Three Luminaries align in measure, the Four Seasons remain ever spring-like, and all things flourish while the people dwell in peace—just as in the land of Hua Xu!\n\nThere was a Perfected One of Cinnabar Origin, whose feathered robes trailed as he approached the sovereign. The sovereign invited him to the seat of honor and, bowing respectfully, asked: \"Perfected One, you have come from afar—what teachings do you bring?\" Cinnabar Origin replied: \"I dwell within the compass, not far from you at all.\" The sovereign asked: \"What is meant by 'within the compass'?\" Cinnabar Origin answered: \"The *Canon* states: 'The Perfected One lurks in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass.' It refers to the center of the precious pearl. From before the Great Simplicity, I was born with you; after the Supreme Ultimate, I stood with you. In movement and stillness, speech and silence, I am ever with you. Yet what you now practice are merely the methods and arts of the middle and lower sections of the *Hidden Talisman Classic*. With these, one may govern the state and achieve great peace, or cultivate the body and extend one’s lifespan. But if one can practice the Dao of immortals embracing the One, ascend to the Jade Void, and attain the rank of Perfected One—when merit is complete and virtue perfected—one may serve as a minister in the Three Realms!\"\n\nThe sovereign said: \"I have long fixed my spirit upon this Dao. Though I have sought instruction far and wide, it has never resonated in my heart. Your arrival, Perfected One, is a blessing from the heavens!\" He bowed again and entreated him for the Dao. Cinnabar Origin said: \"The Dao of immortals embracing the One is the Dao of inner elixir and golden fluid refining the form. I did not know it from birth. Just as those who carve the jade of He and bore the pearl of Sui are master craftsmen, so too is the Great Dao’s returning elixir! Without encountering a teacher’s transmission, there is no principle by which one may awaken on one’s own. Your nature and principles are somewhat clear, but your destiny remains unmastered. Destiny must be refined through the inner elixir; once the inner elixir is complete, the Dao of nature and destiny is fulfilled!\"\n\nThe sovereign pressed further, wishing to hear its essentials. Cinnabar Origin said: \"The Dao of the inner elixir first takes Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel, then Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, with the remaining sixty hexagrams as the firing times. There are stages of gathering, refining, and tempering, as well as proper moments for warming and nurturing, bathing and washing. One seizes the divine workings of creation and transformation, embodying the functions of Heaven and Earth. The oral transmissions and mind-to-mind instructions of immortals and sages are governed by the strictest regulations—this is no trifling matter. Those who possess the Dao must revere it accordingly.\"\n\nThe sovereign asked: \"May I inquire how the inner elixir takes Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel, and Kan and Li as the medicinal substances?\" Cinnabar Origin replied: \"The *Book of Changes* states: 'Heaven and Earth take their positions, and the Changes operate within them.' The crucible, vessel, and medicinal substances are all contained therein. An ancient song says:\n*The crucible is no metal crucible,\nThe furnace no moonlit furnace.\nLi rises from beneath Kan,\nDui dwells within the crucible.*\n\nThe Immortal Wei also said:\n*Model the crescent moon for the furnace and crucible,\nThe White Tiger serves as the pivot for refining.\nMercury, the sun’s flowing pearl,\nAccompanied by the Green Dragon.*\n\nThis is the method of taking the Yin crucible and Yang furnace, with water above and fire below, arranging the twenty-eight constellations, aligning the eight trigrams and four seasons, drilling and clustering the Five Phases, harmonizing the Four Images, refining the dragon and tiger, restraining the hun and po, ensuring inner and outer correspondence, inverting ascent and descent, wielding the authority of creation and transformation, and gestating the mysterious pearl. How vast is the crucible!\"",

      "translated_text": "The Master inquired: \"The alchemical classics speak only of lead and mercury—yet what are lead and mercury truly?\"\n\nThe Elixir Origin replied: \"These are the very medicinal substances. They bear many names—Dragon and Tiger, Crow and Hare, Water and Fire, Metal and Wood, Husband and Wife, Infant Boy and Maiden Girl—too numerous to list. I shall point directly to their essence, that you may awaken!\n\nConsider this: Heaven’s One generates Water, and within Water lies Metal. Outwardly Yin yet inwardly Yang, it resembles the Hare within the Moon—lead containing silver, black enclosing white gold. This is the essence, the true Lead. Earth’s Two generates Fire, and Fire arises from Wood. Outwardly Yang yet inwardly Yin, it resembles the Crow within the Sun—cinnabar yielding mercury, the masculine enfolding the feminine. This is the Wood’s sap, the true Mercury.\n\nTrue Mercury emerges from the Li Palace, the Dragon issuing from Fire. True Lead is born in the Kan position, the Tiger arising from Water. These are not the common cinnabar or quicksilver, sulfur or black tin, nor any of the Five Metals or Eight Stones. They are nothing but the true Yin and true Yang within the body—neither seminal essence, saliva, qi, nor blood, but that which nourishes the vital essence so the medicine may daily grow.\n\nThe practitioner takes the Yang Lead from the Kan position and unites it with the Yin Mercury of the Li Palace. With fire timing unerring, the Elixir must form.\"\n\nThe Perfected One of Purple Yang said:\n*\"Take the solid core from Kan’s center,\nTransform the Yin within Li’s belly.\nFrom this, the firm Qian body is born—\nHidden or soaring, all lies within the heart.\"*\n\nThe Master asked: \"What does it mean to ‘gather on the proper day, harvest at the right time’?\"\n\nThe Elixir Origin replied: \"The *Cantong Qi* states:\n*From darkest night to dawn’s first light,\nZhen arrives to receive the mandate.\nThe Fu hexagram begins its sprouting—\nThe eldest son succeeds the father’s form.*\nAll operations commence here.

Thus the *Yinfu Jing* says:\n*Fire is born of wood,\nDisaster erupts and must be subdued.*\n*Zealotry arises in the state,\nWhen the time moves, it must collapse.*\n\nZiyang also said:\n*Fire is born of wood, its edge concealed—\nWithout skill to drill and temper, do not force the attack.\nDisaster strikes only because it harms oneself;\nOne must seek to subdue it with the Golden Duke.*\nThe Golden Duke is true bismuth.\n\nAs for the firing times:\nOn the third day, *Zhen* stirs;\nOn the eighth day, *Dui* moves.\nWhen the virtues of the three and five are complete,\nThe body of *Qian* is formed.\n*Xun* inherits its lineage,\nSealing and holding fast.\n*Gen* governs advance and retreat,\nNot missing the proper moment.\n*Six-Five Kun* receives,\nBinding the beginning and end.\nWarmly nurture the child-pearl,\nAnd it shall become the mother of all kinds.\n\nWhen yin is exhausted and yang is pure,\nOne transcends and transforms spiritually—\nThis is *formless giving rise to form*,\nA body beyond the body,\nEnduring through vast kalpas,\nTransforming from mortal to sage.\n\nThis Dao sweeps away the three thousand six hundred heterodox paths.\nThe Great Ultimate generates the Three Powers through it;\nParents nurture our bodies through it;\nWe must perfect our true selves through it.\nConceived in primordial chaos,\nBorn in *Kun* and *Gui*,\nVast and indistinct, elusive—\nThose who awaken grasp it for themselves.\"\n\nHaving spoken, the Elixir Origin rose from his seat and entered the compass, suddenly vanishing without a trace. The Master broke into a cold sweat, as if drenched by morning dew, or as if just awakened from a daydream. He sought out Master Yuxi and recounted all that had transpired.\n\nRegarding the Elixir Origin’s words, he sighed deeply and said: \"The Dao lies near, yet one seeks it afar; the matter is easy, yet one seeks it in difficulty. The Elixir Origin’s words existed before the Great Simplicity, born with me; they arose after the Great Ultimate, standing with me. Entering the compass and vanishing into silence, yet the numinous terrace gains truth—is this not the ‘I within me’? If one recognizes this as true, then there is yet another within!\n\nMay I ask: which is greater, you or I?\"\n\nMaster Yuxi replied: \"The Elixir Origin to the Master, the Master to Yuxi—like the moon in water: vast as rivers and seas, small as a dish or bowl. Divided, countless moons appear; gathered, they return to one. Have you not heard the *Lingbao Jing* say: ‘The Primordial Beginning suspended a single treasure-pearl, large as a millet grain, in the empty mystery, five feet above the earth. The Primordial Beginning led the Celestial Perfected, the Great Spirits, the Lofty and Venerable, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the boundless hosts of the Ten Directions and the Utmost Realized Great Spirits—all entered the treasure-pearl.’ Thus this pearl, vast, encompasses the three thousand great thousand worlds; small, it enters the tip of an autumn hair. Vigorously, it is swallowed into the mouth of the pearl—this is the myriad returning to one. How could it stop at three?\"\n\nThe Master asked: \"What is the analogy of the treasure-pearl for humans?\"\n\nMaster Yuxi replied: \"It is precisely the Dao of golden liquid internal elixir and spirit-refinement of which the Elixir Origin spoke. The Yellow Emperor sought the mysterious pearl at Red Water, yet without *Wangxiang*, he could not obtain it—this is that pearl. Regardless of high or low status, every person possesses it, yet it does not depart from within the body. As the ancients’ poem says:\n*A priceless night-luminescent pearl, unrecognized by men—\nFools waste thousands of lives in vain.*\nThis laments their loss and ruin. The profound meaning of the treasure-pearl is indeed the secret essence of the *Lingbao Jing*. It is not something lower scholars may hear; even with cultivation, mere recitation is futile. Though one hears it at dawn and dies at dusk, not one person has truly seen it. Now, the celestial mechanism is revealed—clearly, I tell it to you.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Primordial Beginning is the black ancestor of the primordial azure, the root of Heaven and Earth, the mother of the myriad things—it is the white within black, the silver within lead, the true lead. The Great Floating Li Earth is likened to the palace of Kun and Gui. At first, the divine wind is still and silent, mountains and seas conceal clouds, and qi ascends to the mysterious void. This void is the mysterious of Heaven, born in the Kun palace, growing into the yellow sprout—thus the yellow of Earth. The mysterious of Heaven is the qi of wood-mercury, while the yellow of Earth is the color of metal-lead.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n*The male, yang, scatters the mysterious;\nThe female, yin, transforms the yellow embrace.\nChaos intermingles and joins,\nThe foundation is firmly established.\nTending and nurturing the bud,\nSpirit congeals to form the body.\nThe multitude treads forth,\nAll things wriggle and move by this.*\n\nIlluminating the qi of the mysterious and the yellow, they interact and conceive the precious—this is the insubstantial giving birth to substance, called the Returned Elixir. It is also named the Black Pearl, the Mysterious Pearl, the Treasure Pearl. Those who encounter and refine it do so by the rarest of karmic fortune.\n\nThe Master asked: \"Then where is your treasure pearl?\"\nYuxi Zi pointed above Kun and below Qian, where indeed there was a thing, the size of a millet grain, radiant and translucent, illuminating within and without.\n\nYuxi Zi said: \"This is the elixir of a single day. With my true essence, I seize the workings of creation to generate it. From the subtle to the manifest, success comes in three years. One who enters this transcends the reckoning of the Five Phases!\"\n\nYuxi Zi led the Master to follow and enter. Once within the pearl’s mouth, enlightenment dawned in a flash.\n\n*Disquisition on Resolving Delusions*\nThe essence of cultivating the true lies solely in the Golden Elixir. The Golden Elixir is lead-fire; lead-fire is metal-wood; metal-wood is emotion and nature. Stillness is nature, movement is emotion. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"When metal returns to its original nature, it is then called the Returned Elixir.\"* Clarifying emotion to restore nature, nature returns to the Great Simplicity. When nature returns to the Great Simplicity, life is complete.\n\nIf one only illuminates this nature without cultivating life, it is called solitary cultivation—like the moon after the full, waning day by day, its brightness unseen. When it reaches darkness, it is like a person’s sudden passing. Though the person passes suddenly, nature remains as it was, but life ends and things decay; nature cannot abide and drifts away of itself.\n\nSu Dongpo’s poem, citing Chan metaphors, says:\n*Like the cold moon clinging to bright day,\nOnly a solitary light lingers in old entanglements.*\n\nEven if the mind’s ground ascends to perfect clarity, it is merely guarding a stubborn emptiness. If one can attain flawless thoroughness, one may directly transcend to the Buddha-realm. As the *Heart Sutra* says: *\"No increase, no decrease; no defilement, no purity; no arising, no ceasing\"*—returning to your original face.\n\nIf leakage is not yet exhausted, one will emerge again, not losing the human form. Fortunate indeed! Yet this is because life remains unresolved.",

all.\n\nHmph!\nFill the gourd to the brim with mercury,\nSeal its mouth and plunge it into deep water.\nThe mercury is the intent within my gourd,\nSinking and floating as the water yet breathes—\nHere lies a wondrous principle,\nOnly the enlightened grasp its true essence.\n\nMaster Stone Immortal says:\n*\"The horse of intent returns to the spirit-chamber,\nThe ape of the heart guards the cavern-room.\nSpirit, essence, soul, and will,\nGather to form purple-golden frost.\"*\nTruly, this is the single aperture of the mysterious pass,\nThe serene spirit-chamber—\nNeither within nor without,\nYet clearly pointed out.\n\n*Dharma-Speech of the Elixir Chamber*\nCongeal the mind as the sun, and the spirit unites;\nCongeal the spirit to return to qi and refine the elixir.\nEmotions revert to nature, nature returns to the root to nurture life.\nThe foundation of the returned elixir lies in lead and mercury alone.\nPrimordial essence is the ancestor of life—cherish it, and true lead arises of itself;\nPrimordial spirit is the origin of nature—conserve it, and true mercury is born.\nThus, secure essence to nourish qi, secure qi to nourish spirit.\nLead and mercury meet in due time,\nBreath flows ceaselessly as the fire-tending.\nSpirit and qi never part for an instant,\nForgetting thoughts over time, the golden elixir forms.\n\nIf true lead flees,\nAnd true mercury withers,\nPrimordial essence scatters, primordial spirit weeps—\nTo seek return then, is it not difficult?\n\nMaster Liu Haichan transmitted to Master Ma Ziran the *Formula of the Golden Elixir*, saying:\n*\"I once received the true adept’s oral transmission,\nWho split my belly and opened my bowels to instruct me.\nHe split the lotus but left its heart unbroken,\nDrawing forth the red blood from my very body.\nIt surged straight to the Palace of Great Oneness,\nWhere within the crucible the true sun and moon appeared.\nYin and yang intertwined, crow and hare united,\nA single luminous pearl shone with radiant clarity.\nIt burst through two paths to pierce the Gate of Heaven,\nPlowing the three fields to sow purple snow.\nAt Kunlun’s summit, it scraped the sky bright,\nShaking the Sea Gate as if the earth split.\nThirty spokes converge like the dharmadhātu’s wheel,\nUpper and lower arcs meet the recumbent moon.\nThe work of advancing fire is but stillness,\nAs sun and moon cycle without pause.\nRefined into a cinnabar orange the size of a pellet,\nOne rides the crane and phoenix to court the imperial palace.\"*\n\nMaster Yuxi says:\n*\"The words are simple yet essential—only those who truly encounter it\nShall know the wondrousness of life’s foundation, all contained herein.\nIt cannot be attained through language or script.\"*\n\n*The Practice of Fuxi*\nThe *Golden Fluid Treatise of the Daoist Canon* states:\n*\"The ancients all consumed the Great Elixir of Golden Flower and Dragon Embryo,\nThereby attaining transformation and flight, ascending into formlessness.\nYet in that age, there were no crucibles, no firewood,\nNo five metals or eight minerals—\nClearly, this was internal alchemy!\"*\n\nThe sage Fuxi, perceiving heaven’s mechanism, drew the trigrams,\nEmbodying creation to inaugurate the *Book of Changes*.\nThe *Changes* begins with the drawing of trigrams.\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"Heaven and earth take their positions,\nMountain and marsh exchange qi,\nThunder and wind contend,\nWater and fire do not oppose one another.\"*\nNine returns and seven reversions—\nThese are the principles embodied in practice.\n\nTracing back to Qian and Kun, Kan and Li,\nThe bellows of the female and male—\nAll are fundamentally one, fundamentally one.\nBy inverting their symbols,\nThe crucible and medicinal substances are revealed.\nAt the first stirring of the night’s qi,\nWhen the initial yang begins to sprout,\nThe sea waves seethe,\nThe black turtle sprays its mist,\nMetal and water align,\nLike the toad spewing its wheel.\nGather it in an instant,\nBind it in a moment.\n\nThe Yellow Center issues its decree,\nThe nation knows no harmful ways,\nWeapons rest, punishments cease,\nHeaven is clear, earth is tranquil.\nSun and moon traverse east and west,\nWater and fire govern south and north.\nDragon coils, tiger crouches,\nMetal strikes, wood flourishes.\nAt the turn of yi and gui,\nThe first dawn of *fu* responds.\nThe hun is born in Zhen’s geng,\nDui receives ding—\nThis is the upper arc, eight taels of metal.\nAt the fullness of the fifteenth,\nThe peak of jia and ren,\nThe po grows in Xun’s xin,\nGen receives bing—\nThis is the lower arc, half a catty of water.\nAt the sixth and fifth returning to darkness,\nThe northeast loses its companion.\nCyclical and endless,\nAdvancing and retreating with the fire’s rhythm.\nThe host within the dwelling,\nConcentrating inwardly,\nWithdrawing sight and returning hearing,\nAbiding in effortless ease.\nEncompassing the ten thousand images,\nPerfecting the utmost spirit—\nAt the two solstices and two equinoxes,\nWarmth, coolness, cold, and heat,\nDay and night, hours and moments,\nFollow without forcing.\n\nWhen mao and you govern punishment and virtue,\nBathe and cleanse.\nIn a single day,\nMyriad transformations arise.\nUplifted, harmonious, and joyous,\nThe hundred meridians flutter gently,\nDripping like spring rain,\nFlowing like melting ice.\nFrom the head, it streams to the feet,\nThen ultimately ascends again.\nThe flute and reed pipe sound hollowly,\nLike the autumn cicada’s rising and falling song.\nTrue qi swims and drifts,\nOverflowing the heart—then oppression,\nThe navel and abdomen ache in yin’s pain,\nEndured with hesitation and stumbling.\n\nAt this time,\nRegulate breath to be ceaseless,\nFocus attention within the compass.\nThe yin pain is no true pain,\nEndure it with gentle intent,\nLike the tender feelings of a maiden,\nOr the spring slumber of the crabapple.\nOne feels the two kidneys as if boiling,\nThen the bladder as if scorching—\nThis is the spirit and qi of the spirit-chamber becoming substance,\nOne’s own wandering soul undergoing transformation.\n\nThus,\nDraw in a single breath to circulate,\nStir the numinous spring to flow.\nUnrefined butterflies scatter like blossoms,\nFalling unevenly in all directions,\nTransforming into jade liquid.\nAgain, like sweet dew at the crown,\nAbout to split the three yangs,\nGathering spirit and qi to fill the chamber,\nNone can retain it.\nThose who guard it prosper,\nThose who lose it perish.\nThe essence of the three and five,\nThe utmost spirit of heaven and earth,\nPure and unobstructed,\nIts spirit never wearies—\nThus one knows the true nature of Qian’s vigor,\nReturning to become an infant.\n\nIn silent sitting,\nThe empty chamber generates brightness,\nSnow and moon shine together,\nFlowing pearls and golden medicine,\nLightning and cinnabar oranges—\nAll appear as if outside.\nAt times, one sees the old dwelling,\nClear and distinct in every part.\nThe clods of earth and dust,\nNeither rejoiced in nor surprised by,\nThe mind steadfastly fixed—\nSuddenly, one’s body is embraced,\nA cinnabar serpent coils around the heart.\n\nOne may also see strange beings,\nRevealing their forms,\nBeautiful women or mad spirits,\nWeeping and pleading in sorrowful longing.\nSome foretell future events,\nOthers claim to be heavenly messengers,\nDeparting only to return,\nStirring delusive thoughts.\nRemain unmoved,\nLet them live or die—\nSince the heart does not receive them,\nIn time, they vanish of themselves.",

Only by severing ties and withdrawing from worldly affairs should one first entrust governance to those of virtue and power.\n\nA year has three hundred sixty days, totaling four thousand three hundred twenty hours. Subtracting the seven hundred twenty hours for bathing, only three thousand six hundred hours remain. Thus, the true qi of these three thousand six hundred hours responds to Qian’s one hundred forty-four counting rods and Kun’s two hundred sixteen, forming the function of the sixty hexagrams. The four hexagrams of mating—Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—are not included. These four hexagrams of mating, Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, together comprise three hundred eighty-four lines, corresponding to three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, matching the weight of one *jin*, with intercalary time included.\n\nThe counting rods of the two *pian* total three hundred sixty. Each hour corresponds to twenty-four *zhu* of fire, one *liang*. In a month, excluding *mao* and *you*, this amounts to seven thousand two hundred *zhu*; in a year, eighty-six thousand four hundred *zhu*, equaling two hundred twenty-five *jin* of fire. Within this, the tenfold multiplication yields eight hundred sixty-four thousand of true qi, totaling two thousand two hundred fifty *jin* of fire, which transmutes the body inherited from one’s parents into a body of pure yang. Truly, formlessness gives rise to form, and a body exists beyond the body. At first, one step, then two; later, a hundred steps make a mile. After three years and nine cycles, one roams freely through heaven and earth—treading water and fire, penetrating metal and stone. Though faced with Yao’s floods or Tang’s droughts, the calamities of yang-nine and yin-six, all pose no peril.\n\nWhen the Dao is perfected and virtue accomplished, one conceals oneself to await the time. The Supreme Unity then summons, relocating one to the Central Land. When merit is fulfilled, one ascends, receiving the register and chart.

western river’s azure pool,\nThe true dragon of the eastern sea—\nAt the sight of the true tiger, one rises as the other sinks,\nBoth covetous, each devouring the other.\n\nThe two beasts meet in battle,\nWaves surging like a seething cauldron.\nAn ancient song says:\n\"The Green Dragon pursues the tiger, the tiger seeks the dragon,\nThe red birds unite with clamorous cries.\"\nAs dragon contends with tiger,\nWater clashes with fire,\nThe cauldron seethes and roils,\nInversion and restraint arise,\nAnd the infant’s cry is heard.\n\nThe Yellow Dame and Elder Ding lend their mighty power.\nThe True Stone Man says:\n\"The Yellow Dame’s twin breasts are fair,\nElder Ding’s single heart is kind.\nAs dragon and tiger wage war,\nThe lord remains unaware.\"\nThe Yellow Dame was explained earlier;\nElder Ding is the gentle fire.\n\nMaster Yin Zhen says:\n\"I am the Dao of boundless worlds,\nYet know only to subdue the infant’s heart.\"\nThis truly reveals heaven’s secret.\n\nThe quaking shakes heaven and earth, startling gods and spirits.\nAn ancient song says:\n\"The sage seizes the workings of creation,\nGrasping sun and moon to place within the furnace.\nGently inverting the essence of heaven and earth,\nGathering yin and yang to rouse gods and spirits.\"\nGods and spirits are the celestial soul and earthly spirit.\n\nIn an instant, the battle ceases and the mists disperse,\nClouds withdraw, rain scatters, all returns to silence—\nWithin the palm, fortune is transformed.\nA mysterious pearl is planted in the mud’s depths.\n\n*The Return of Life* says:\n\"At night, chaos falls to earth,\nThe myriad forms vanish without trace.\"\nThis is the single point descending into the Yellow Court—\nThe Yellow Court is the central palace, the Yellow Chamber,\nThe mysterious pass, likened to the mud’s depths.\n\nMaster Ziyang says:\n\"Within one double-hour, the elixir is complete\"—\nThe elixir is achieved in a single day.\nDay by day, it grows by a grain of millet,\nGradually forming the mysterious pearl.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor sought the mysterious pearl in the Crimson Waters,\nYet without Vast Image, it could not be obtained—\nThis is that very pearl,\nVast Image being thoughtless and carefree.\n\nFrom this, the root and sprout gradually mature,\nConstantly nourished by the embrace of true essence.\nThe Three Valleys Master says:\n\"Establish the foundation for a hundred days,\nThen nurture it through the full cycle of the stars.\nSimply guard the essence, spirit, and sound,\nWater will naturally moisten, fire will naturally nurture,\nWaiting until the qi is full.\"\n\nAfter ten months, the embryo is shed, and the elixir is swallowed into the belly,\nSuddenly, the mortal frame is felt to possess spirit.\nMaster Ziyang also says:\n\"A grain of the sacred elixir is swallowed into the belly.\"\nAgain, it is called \"shedding the embryo,\"\nAnd \"communing with the divine and sagely.\"\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\n\"Golden sand enters the five viscera,\nMist scatters like wind and rain.\"\nIf this is the inner elixir,\nHow can it be said to enter the belly, the mouth, the five viscera?\nLater generations, doubting this, took it for an external elixir.\nYet they did not know that from formlessness comes form—\nThis is called the Returned Elixir.\n\nThe True Unity Master said:\n\"First, plumb the primordial chaotic qi of heaven and earth as the foundation;\nThen, gather the essence of qian and kun, subtly moving their traces to form the image;\nFollow the numbers of kan and li, pi and tai to establish punishment and virtue;\nSteal the mechanism of yin and yang’s transformations to complete winter and summer.\nYin arises after noon, yang stirs at midnight’s beginning.\nThus, qian and kun serve as the crucible and vessel,\nKan and li as the medicinal substances,\nThe remaining sixty hexagrams as the fire times.\nRefining, nurturing, and subtly seizing the work of transformation—\nLike fruit growing on a branch,\nThe child within the womb,\nAfter ten months, the fire times and qi are full,\nThen suddenly, the spirit sheds and enters the true embryo,\nUniting with heaven!\"\n\nThus it is said to enter the mouth, the belly, the five viscera.\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\n\"Like a chicken’s egg,\nWhite and black align,\nA span of one inch in length and breadth,\nAs the beginning.\nThe four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones are all complete,\nAfter ten months, it emerges from the womb.\"\nThis is truly from formlessness comes form,\nA body beyond the body.\nClinging to the old frame traps one in darkness,\nEmerging from the ninth mud is to roam heaven and earth,\nInscribed in the immortal register,\nTitled as a True Person—\nThe moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name is achieved.\n\nThis matter is rare in the world,\nNot known to ordinary people.\nIf one lacks the immortal’s bone from past lives,\nHow could it be easily encountered?\nHaving encountered it, refine it swiftly—\nThe passing scenery flies like an arrow.\nTo catch the fish, one must cast the net;\nDo not stand by the pool and sigh in vain.\n\n\"I have heard you have known the medicine for many years,\nWhy not gather your heart and refine mercury and lead?\nDo not let the candle be blown out by the wind,\nFor the six paths of rebirth leave no room to blame heaven.\"\n\nThese words admonish Immortal Liu,\nUrging him to gather his heart and refine mercury and lead.\nFrom this, it is clear that the inner elixir must be refined within oneself,\nNot relying on external medicines for distinction.\n\nLately, worldly people are full of deceit,\nCompeting to don Daoist robes and claim the Way.\nAsk them what metal and wood are—\nThey fall silent, mute and ashamed.\n\nMetal and wood are explained in *Essential Pointers* under \"Metal and Wood Intermingling\":\n\"Without knowing this, one cannot speak of the Returned Elixir.\"\nYet they say it is about breath control and fasting,\nClaiming another school with profound principles.\nHave you not seen *The Song of Breaking Delusion*?\n\"The method of Embracing True Unity is strongest.\"\n\nSide paths and minor arts number in the thousands,\nYet they have no relation to the Dao of the Golden Liquid’s return.\nWhat is the Dao?\nEmbracing the true qi of Unity,\nThe five stars aligned in a string,\nThe sun and moon conjoined—\nThe inner elixir is formed from this,\nThe Dharma-body emerges from this,\nThere is no second gate.",

      "translated_text": "Do not fault my words for their crudeness—\nIt is only that the world lacks discernment.\nOnly when your heart aligns with mine\nDo I dare pour forth my thoughts to you.\n\n**Preface to the Twelve-Character Secret of the Regulated Center Diagram**\n\nThree thousand six hundred methods,\nTens of schools for nurturing life—\nAll are side paths, nothing but crooked trails.\nTake, for instance, breath-holding to inflate the belly,\nThe \"Flying Golden Essence\" behind the elbow,\nAbsorbing and grinding to move the River Chariot,\nBreath retention as the fire-timing,\nInhaling clarity and exhaling turbidity,\nConnecting with realms to channel flows,\nGuiding the turtle and rotating the perch,\nMirroring form to seek transcendence,\nPreserving the top vent,\nGuarding the space between the brows—\nAll are piling heads upon heads,\nCreating affairs where none exist,\nDisordering the sequence,\nDeviating from the utmost truth.\nThus they cause the hundred vessels to seethe,\nThe Three Fields to erupt in chaos,\nHoping for eternal life,\nYet only harming their own.\nThis stems from opposing the harmony of Heaven and Earth,\nFailing to align with the principle of spontaneity.\n\nAfter thirty years of simplifying and reviewing the *Can Tong Qi*,\nI have grasped its mysteries.\nComparing it with other alchemical classics,\nI distilled its essential threads\nTo compose the *Twelve-Character Secret of the Regulated Center Diagram*,\nTransmitting it to those who study the Dao,\nTo rectify the heart and sincerify the will,\nMaking them the central pillar,\nThe axis within that governs the without.\nEight characters serve as auxiliaries,\nRegulating the four seasons,\nResponding from without to within.\nAbove, it harmonizes with the heart of Heaven;\nIn the middle, it examines human affairs;\nSilently conforming to creation,\nFollowing the track of yin and yang,\nExternally modeling the Five Phases,\nInternally ordering the Five Viscera—\nThus it becomes the endless cycle of daily use.\nNo action is taken,\nNo visualization is held.\nIn serene great stability,\nThe primal mechanism is grasped.\nOnly require:\nCutting off desires,\nStilling the heart and qi,\nReducing thoughts,\nModerating diet,\nRegulating breath,\nGuarding against drowsiness,\nRestraining sight and sound,\nNurturing Heaven’s harmony.\nWithin the four dignified postures,\nAlign with spontaneity—\nNo complexity or difficulty exists.\n\nFor those who have established the *yinqie* (silver enclosure),\nThis serves to harmonize with the fire and nurture the sacred embryo.\nFor those who have not yet established the *yinqie*,\nThis strengthens the primal qi,\nNourishes the spirit,\nAnd serves as the gradual foundation for establishing the *yinqie*.\nWhen depletion, loss, or illness assails,\nThis drives away sickness and secures the primal,\nServing as a method for supplementation, longevity,\nAnd the art of nurturing life—\nTruly the simplest of gates!\n\n**The Regulated Center Diagram**\n\nThe \"Regulated Center\" is like dwelling within a compass’s circle—\nNeither inside nor outside,\nNeither clinging to images\nNor attaching to things.\nIt is the center within the body,\nThe center within the mind,\nLike the \"I\" within a great round mirror.\nSimply rectify the heart and sincerify the will,\nMaking them the central pillar.\nWhen all thoughts are extinguished,\nThe true person appears—\nLike a fish dwelling in the deep abyss,\nSwimming freely yet never leaving the square inch.\nThus the true person lurks in the deep abyss,\nFloating and guarding the Regulated Center.\n\nWhen joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have not yet arisen,\nAt this time, one can reside in the Regulated Center,\nFloating and swimming to govern the four seasons,\nRectifying creation.\nWithin the four dignified postures,\nOne must not lose proper measure!\nWhen things come, respond and let them pass,\nThen return to the center—\nBut never disturb the central pillar.\nWithin the center, maintain emptiness,\nNot a speck of dust arises.\nOver time, neither indulgence nor restraint,\nOne naturally attains its benefits.\nIts subtlety lies in:\nThe six yin returning to Kun,\nThe myriad things returning to the origin,\nThe *Fu* hexagram’s first sprouting,\nThe eldest son inheriting the father’s body,\nThe solitary yang stirring in concealment—\nThe time before the myriad things arise.\nAll begins here—\nThis is the point of application.\n\nAt this moment,\nSit cross-legged in great stillness,\nConcentrate the spirit and inwardly illuminate,\nRegulate the breath to be continuous and soft,\nSilently guard it.\nThen the qi arises from the formless,\nVast and obscure,\nWithout color or shape,\nEmerging in the profound darkness,\nThe region of Kun and Gui,\nBorn within the kidneys,\nTo nurture the primal essence,\nSupplement and continue the primal qi,\nUnceasing and unexhausted,\nGrowing stronger day by day.\nFirst, it dispels illness;\nNext, it returns to infancy.\nAccumulated, it becomes the foundation of the inner elixir!\n\nMaster Tuzhen said:\n\"This is the primal qi,\nSupplementing the primal qi—\nHow could it be mere common cinnabar?\"\nThis is the supreme method of supplementation.\n\n**Morning Layering (Zhaotun):**\nThe body of the noble one begins its governance,\nThe first sprouting of the myriad things,\nThe inception of benevolence.\nAt the *zi* hour, the qi of initial generation resides in the kidneys—\nIt comes unbidden, so treasure and nurture it.\nRegulate the breath so the ears do not hear,\nSimply listen to its gentle, continuous flow,\nAligning with spontaneity,\nResonating with the key of Heaven and Earth.\nOver time, kidney qi merges with heart qi,\nThe two qi interact,\nDescending as sweet dew,\nAnd producing the mysterious pearl!\n\n**Evening Enveloping (Mumeng):**\nEnveloping to nurture correctness—\nThe sagely work,\nNot losing the heart of the infant.\nAt the *wu* hour, the qi of initial generation resides in the heart.\nWithout thought or worry,\nStill and unmoving,\nInwardly illuminate in profound silence to unite with it.\nSit in stillness to gather it.\nOver time, heart qi naturally merges with kidney qi,\nAchieving the work of *Jiji* (Completion).\n\nHumans reside within the Three Powers,\nTheir body equaling Heaven and Earth,\nThus their qi corresponds with Heaven and Earth,\nTheir true unity’s essence conforms.\nA person’s primal qi spans eight hundred ten *zhang*,\nResembling the bellows—\nThe great movement of primal qi follows Heaven,\nThe lesser movement follows the sun.\nYet people cannot embody and model Heaven and Earth,\nLeading to severance, damage, and ruin,\nSpirit and essence confused and disordered,\nDeviating from them on their own—\nHow could Heaven and Earth deviate from them?\n\nIf one can follow its principles,\nGrasp its mechanism,\nThen one can align with the work of creation\nAnd engage in the Dao of inner refinement,\nThe path of long life and enduring vision.\nApart from humans, all else is endowed with turbid confusion,\nExisting within the primal qi,\nMerely transformed things—\nHow could they govern the primal qi?\n\nThe *Can Tong Qi* states:\n\"In spring and summer, rely on the inner body,\nFrom *zi* to *chen-si*;\nIn autumn and winter, act externally,\nFrom *wu* to *xu-hai*.\"\nIt also says:\n\"Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn,\nDawn and dusk follow cold and heat.\nThe hexagram lines contain benevolence and righteousness,\nTimely expressing joy and anger.\nThus responding to the four seasons,\nThe Five Phases attain their principles.\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus, *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* correspond to spring; *mao*, *chen*, and *si* to summer; *wu*, *wei*, and *shen* to autumn; *you*, *xu*, and *hai* to winter.\n\n*Zi*, *chou*, and *yin* align with spring, when Wood prevails. Wood governs benevolence, the time when the myriad things sprout forth. Hence, the two words *xi* (flourishing) and *he* (harmony) nurture it—*xi* as in the radiant joy of spring’s ascent to the terrace. *He* means beauty: the golden mean penetrating principle, dwelling in its rightful place within the body, flowing through the four limbs, manifesting in one’s undertakings—this is the perfection of beauty. Like an infant not yet able to laugh, crying without hoarseness, this is the perfection of harmony. Unaware of the union of male and female, yet the genitalia stir—this is the perfection of essence.\n\n*Mao*, *chen*, and *si* align with summer, when Fire prevails. Fire governs ritual, the time when the myriad things flourish in order. Thus, the two words *zhong* (centeredness) and *he* (harmony) nurture it. Once harmony is achieved, there is neither excess nor deficiency—this is called *zhong* (the mean). Only then can the emotions and nature roam freely without turbulence.\n\n*Wu*, *wei*, and *shen* align with autumn, when Metal prevails. Metal governs righteousness, the time when grasses and trees yellow and wither, and the myriad things are harvested. Hence, the two words *lian* (restraint) and *jing* (stillness) cultivate it, fulfilling the nature of the myriad things.\n\n*You*, *xu*, and *hai* align with winter, when Water prevails. Water governs wisdom, the time when the myriad things return to their roots and the primal *qi* begins its solemn retreat. Thus, the two words *lian* (restraint) and *su* (solemnity) conceal it, aligning with the *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe *Can Tong Qi* states:\n\"The true person abides in the deep abyss,\nFloating and roaming, guarding the compass within.\"\n\nThe \"true person\" is none other than the one true self: when congealed, it is spirit; when in use, it is the heart; when still, it is nature. Neither moving nor still, empty yet spiritually penetrating—it is also called the true heart. It swims within the compass, within the square and circle of the rules, master of creation, moving without deviation, centered and responsive to the four seasons. Nurtured by trust, it becomes true Earth. Issuing commands and decrees, it nurtures the primal *qi*, governs and cultivates the primal essence, transforming and giving birth to purity. It harmonizes the Five Phases without coercion, thereby connecting the harmony of Heaven and Earth. Thus, rectifying the heart and making the intent sincere, one can achieve impartiality. Only then do *Qian* and *Kun* unite in peace, *Kan* and *Li* intermingle, yin and yang harmonize, and the myriad things flourish. The three luminaries align in proper measure, bringing about great peace. Thereafter, the nation prospers, the people are at ease, and the hundred bones are all in order.\n\n**Explanation of the Pure Yang True Person’s \"Spring in the Garden\"**\n\nThe Pure Yang Perfected’s *Qin Yuan Chun* is a lyric that distills the ultimate principles of the returning elixir, circulated throughout the world. Though many commentaries exist, they often stray into pedantry. How could they know that this bit of immortal method lies not within the three thousand six hundred gates? Thus, one must meet heart with heart, intent with intent. Only when one reaches the delight of this realm does one truly trust that it arises from spontaneity.",

      "translated_text": "One might say the essential Dao is not complex, the work is easy—freeing oneself from the web of doubts to enter the gate of myriad wonders. I have composed sixteen seven-character quatrains, pairing each with a verse by Master Tongning, totaling twenty pounds in weight, and appended direct annotations to reveal the profound mechanism. May the reader savor them carefully, for grasping one corner reveals all others alike.\n\n*Written in the late spring of the bingyin year of the Xianchun era, by the late learner Yuxizi of Yichun, during the Xiuxi festival.*\n\n**Qinyuan Lyrics**\n\nLifting the topic at hand is the very matter of the Dao-heart.\nHark!\nIn the fine night of clear brightness,\nIn the chaos of the infant’s uncarved state,\nOne finds the delight of the stringless zither—\nNo notes of *gong* or *shang* may outsiders know.\n\nThe sevenfold return of the elixir,\nGold restored to its original nature,\nThis is the sevenfold return,\nAchieving success through earth,\nCalled the ninefold restoration.\nPassion returns to the sea of nature, termed the union,\nThe furnace refines golden radiance, named the return.\nNurtured wholly by the power of true earth,\nRefined into a spirit-body, one emerges from the dusty world.\n\nIn man, the great Dao resides only within the self;\nThe inner elixir must be refined a hundredfold.\nThe Great One divides into three, yet man attains the one;\nThe great medicine is sought only within the body.\nPitiful are the ten thousand thousands,\nWho take all this as mere pleasure and ease.\n\nFirst, refine the self and await the moment.\nRefining the self begins with subduing the heart;\nThe gathering of medicine has its own season.\nTurning the mechanism sets one apart from the vulgar,\nThe heart serene and still as an infant.\nLook closely: creation’s root is no-thing—\nWhen spring arrives in Jiangnan, flowers bloom of themselves.\n\nAt the first stirring of the true yang,\n*Kun* transforms into *Fu*—\nIs this not the heart of heaven and earth revealed?\nSitting in stillness upon the rush mat, thoughts stilled,\nThe spirit’s abode breathes in and out, ever more slowly.\nWarm, misty qi returns to the celestial valley—\nKnow this as the moment when yang begins its return.\n\nIn the deep of night, the water-clock endures;\nMidnight is the hour when the night’s watch feels longest.\nSteaming qi rises, all sounds hushed in clarity—\nWithin the body, winter solstice aligns with the third watch.\nWho can fathom such delight?\nOnly the sound of the bronze clepsydra’s dripping remains.\n\nGently warmed, the lead crucible—\nThe crucible is no metal crucible,\nThe furnace no moon furnace.\n*Li* arises from beneath *Kan*,\n*Dui* resides within the crucible.\nThe jade hare’s decoction boils and surges,\nThe golden furnace’s fire blazes, its light growing bright.\nWho perceives the existence within nothingness?\nWithin lies golden radiance—the foundation of the sage.\n\nLight pierces the curtain,\nThe original spirit generates yang,\nDivine light flickers—\nThe heart in profound stillness illumines inwardly,\nAll returns to the primordial void.\nAt first, the qi is azure, a color yet no-color,\nEmerging from the dragon’s tower to return to the phoenix’s palace.\nBeneath the lapis lazuli screen, candles glow in mutual brilliance,\nBy the river where women bleach silk, the rain has just ceased.\n\nCreation’s pace hastens—\nHusband and wife return to the chamber.\nThe moon reaches the yang palace,\nWithin the waves of peach blossoms,\nDragon and tiger meet.\nRed and black unite, the world cannot guess—\nAll depends on *wu* and *ji* as the matchmaker.\nA full ladle of the marrow of heaven and earth—\nSeek it with intent and drink it in.\n\nThe work of advancing the fire is like treading a perilous path.\nFire arises within water,\nFlowers bloom amid thunder—\nSingle-minded vigilance,\nSteady and skillful.\nWithin the realm of primordial chaos, qi swirls and steams,\nOn the branch of red apricot, spring in its second month.\nBut keep the golden pass firmly sealed—\nThe turning mechanism is the treasure within the house.\n\nBy the winding river, the moon’s radiance gleams still—\nA crow takes flight.\nThe oxherd and weaver girl’s bond,\nThe Dao’s root in tortoise and snake,\nInnately so—\nThe yang crow meets the new moon, uniting in beauty,\nThe two qi mutually sustain and revolve.\nThis is the union of lead and mercury—\nDo not mistake it for the nine bends of the small intestine.\n\nMaster Xiaozhen’s verse says:\nAbove the winding river, the magpie bridge spans,\nThe bond of oxherd and weaver girl—\nThis is the Dao itself.\nThe great medicine, the golden elixir, is born from this.\nIf you doubt, but knock at the *jia-yi* gate,\nThe twin youths will naturally guide you on your way.\nThe *jia-yi* gate is like the *wu-ji* portal.\nWithin this principle lies profound depth,\nBeyond the reach of brush or tongue—\nYet it is merely a matter within the self.\n\nHark!\nTo know the path beneath the mountain,\nAsk those who come and go.\n\nAt that time, one drinks the *daogui* of one’s own accord—\nThe two earths are *wu* and *ji*,\nThe golden blade is lead and mercury.\nDragon coiled, tiger crouched, guarding the center,\n*Li* and *Kan* merge, the light of sun and moon.\nAfter drinking, one awakens and returns to the grotto palace—\nThe flowery pond, lush with lotus fragrance.\n\nWho would believe a child is nurtured within nothingness?\nWithin the body, yin and yang;\nWithin the pot, sun and moon—\nAll immortals and sages,\nOriginally no different.\nIf not one of those within,\nHow could I explain it to you?\n\nRefine essence to nurture the spiritual root,\nRefine qi to nurture the spirit—\nLead and mercury transform and nourish the true body.\nSuddenly, one pierces through the mud-pill palace—\nOnly then does one trust that immortals do not deceive.\n\nDiscern the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source,\nThe separation of wood and metal—\nWithout a teacher’s guidance,\nThis matter is hard to know.\nLead sinks, silver floats—\nThe clear above, the turbid below.\nThe clear is golden radiance,\nThe turbid is lead’s essence.\nTo unite golden radiance with the liquid of wood—\nThis is the wondrous method of employing lead.\nWhen the two meet, passion and nature merge;\nWhen the millet pearl forms, wood and metal separate.\nWithout a teacher’s guidance,\nThis matter is hard to know.\n\nThe clear and turbid, sinking and floating, share a single source—\nTo take the clear and discard the turbid is even more profound.\nThe merging and separation must be distinguished—\nThe wonder lies in a single word from a true teacher.\n\nThe Dao is subtle and mysterious,\nThe celestial mechanism deep and distant—\nBegin practice swiftly, for time is fleeting.\nOnly when one reaches the point of shame\nDoes one know one’s skill is not yet refined.\n\nAs Master Baiyun said:\nThose who slander it are like grasping a giant melon stem to sweep Mount Kunlun;\nThose who savor it are like swans and cranes drinking from the vast sea.\nThe views of the well-frog and fence-sparrow—\nHow could they know the vastness of sea and sky?\n\nDiligence without encounter—\nOne must encounter it;\nEncountering it without refinement is still folly.\nCherish each moment,\nDo not let time pass in vain.\nAwaken swiftly,\nPractice urgently—\nWhen will the precious pearl in hand shine clear?\nIf the hut is ruined, how can it be rebuilt?\n\nWithin the millet pearl, the world is vast—\nThe immortal true ones surge within.\nHow many gaze in vain,\nSighing at the heavens’ height, deeming it unattainable?\n\nMaster Changchun’s verse says:\nSun and moon swiftly fly overhead,\nTime swiftly passes before one’s eyes.\nTurning to look back, one is already old—\nTo begin practice swiftly is still too late.",
      "overlap_context": "ng in the Garden\"**\n\nThe Pure Yang Perfected’s *Qin Yuan Chun* is a lyric that distills the ultimate principles of the returning elixir, circulated throughout the world. Though many commentaries exist, they often stray into pedantry. How could they know that this bit of immortal method lies not within the three thousand six hundred gates? Thus, one must meet heart with heart, intent with intent. Only when one reaches the delight of this realm does one truly trust that it arises from spontaneity.",

      "translated_text": "During the Shaoxing era, in the southern part of Yichun, the household of Prefect Wei of the Wei clan harbored many secrets. One day, an extraordinary person entered directly into his study and called out, \"Prefect Wei, come forth for a word.\" At the time, Wei was napping during the day, and his attendants dared not announce the visitor. The stranger left a *ci* poem on the wall before departing, titled *Sumuzhe*. When Wei awoke and saw it, he deeply regretted the missed encounter and sent men to search, but the visitor could not be found. The poem read:\n\nWithin the waters, gold aligns with Ox and Dipper,\nJade locks and golden gates,\nGuarded by divine youths of the Dharma.\nRed River’s cinnabar terrace—\nDragons and tigers roam,\nMyriad forms in solemn array,\nVigorously casting forth the pearl.\n\nDrink from the numinous spring, refine the fire’s timing,\nThe Great One’s furnace opens,\nThe elixir ripens, divine radiance pierces through.\nFleeting fame and profit soon fade—\nSwiftly begin practice,\nExhaust the \"nothing\" to attain the \"something.\"\nThe path to Penglai—\nRely on three thousand deeds fulfilled,\nThen stride alone upon the clouds to return.\n\nThe *Scripture of the August Void* states: \"Those who wish to cultivate the Dao must first establish merit. Thus, the Celestial Emperors of the heavens, the exalted Heavenly Emperors, the Perfected of the heavens, and the Divine Immortals of the heavens all ascend to the sagely and perfected ranks through meritorious deeds. The heavens record merit, and worldly scholars who cultivate the true resolve, once their merit is complete and virtue perfected, shed the mortal to become immortals, transform from immortals to Perfected, and the Perfected attain boundless freedom, merging with spontaneity. When dissolved, they become qi; when at rest, they become human. With spiritual penetrations and self-mastery, they transform without form, soar through the Three Realms, and traverse the hidden and obscure. Cultivators must first cherish essence and treasure qi, anchor the mind and concentrate spirit, establishing the foundation for nurturing the elixir. Then, entering seclusion for three thousand days, the inner work must not be the slightest bit deficient, until the embryo is fully formed, transcending to the primordial origin. Yet external conduct is also essential to accord with the Dao of Heaven. Thus, merit cannot be too abundant, and conduct cannot be too broad. With three thousand merits fulfilled, one becomes an immortal of the Great Veil; with three thousand deeds of conduct fulfilled, one becomes a guest of the Great Veil.\"\n\nMaster Zhongli said: \"Merit without conduct is like having no feet; conduct without merit leaves the feet unable to advance. Only with both merit and conduct complete are the feet fully prepared—who then can say one has no share in becoming a divine immortal?\"\n\nMoreover, those who cultivate the Dao and attain the Way first dwell in Penglai, Fangzhang, or Yingzhou, becoming unbound immortals. The Primordial Sovereign of the Great One then summons them to receive the chart, their names inscribed in the immortal register, ascending step by step to the sagely ranks, paying court to the Jade Emperor, and receiving the title of Perfected. They must further guide and transform later generations, universally practicing and enlightening, until reaching the state of \"no cultivation, no attainment,\" which is called spontaneity.\n\nA poem by a High Perfected reads:\nIn the tenth month, the fire’s timing is cast aside,\nThe inner work’s hours have reached three thousand.\nFurther relying on external conduct to accord with Heaven’s Dao,\nOne transcends the primordial origin to verify the Upper Immortal.\n\nWhen Master Quanzhen Wang and Zhang attained the Dao, they composed the *Ci of Untying the Girdle*, which says:\nCultivators,\nTheir meritorious efforts are no small matter,\nDiscerning the reversal and inversion of the five phases,\nThe wondrous principle is profoundly abstruse.\nWithin the jade furnace, dragons coil and tigers crouch,\nIn the golden tripod, the supreme treasure is refined.\nThe yang spirit departs the body,\nVast and obscure,\nIn an instant, it roams the three isles.\nOnce entry and exit are mastered,\nRestrain and hold fast,\nSeek further mysteries,\nMerge with true emptiness—\nThe Great Void is the culmination.\n\nFive Esoteric Poems:\n\n*Hiss and blow*—three feet, yet no trace,\nRelease and gather, swift as the wind.\nAmong a hundred thousand, select one or two,\nTo entrust this Dao to you.\n\nThe second:\nExtended like lightning, round as the moon,\nNot for men—do not draw near.\nTo verify Buddhahood or attain Perfection, this is needed,\nThese subtle wonders require a master.\n\nThe third:\nCutting nails and severing iron, cleaving delusion,\nThe wondrous function, freely applied, comes from the master.\nReturning at will, filling the sleeves,\nCaress and nurture it as a grandson.\n\nThe fourth:\nRadiance blazing, pressing upon the body,\nBones tremble, hair stands on end—what to do?\nIf you are truly a man, you will not fear,\nWith one stroke, the truth is revealed at once.\n\nThe fifth:\nAmong a hundred thousand, one or two,\nWith one stroke, it must align with the sages’ minds.\nThe red youth manifests numinous auspices,\nWithered wood blooms, iron turns to gold.\n\nIn Praise of the Immortal of Pure Yang:\n\nSupreme virtue defies naming,\nPrimordial merit does not govern—\nWhat need for gathas or praises?\nHeaven is impartial,\nOnly virtue is aided,\nThe sagely teacher is never far.\n\nPhoenix-like bearing, a spirit of the age,\nA true Confucian of the moon’s visage and dragon beard,\nA scion of Tang officials.\nAwakened by the Yellow Millet Dream,\nHe severed the endless cycle of life and death.\nOnce the elixir was formed, he sought only to deliver others,\nHis rank exalted, ever aiding the drowning.\n\nIn the southern lands, he refined gold lead and wood mercury;\nIn Bianjing, he savored the jade nectar of Suka.\nWhen he manifested as Quanzhen,\nCountless living beings relied on his grace.\nWielding three swords as admonitions,\nHe nurtured hundreds and thousands of disciples with love.\n\nAt times, white duckweed and red reeds;\nAt times, the Purple Palace and Clear Capital.\nLetting go of all, he beheld the Great Void,\nYet still stood in attendance at the Hall of Luminous Understanding.\n\nThe realm revered his noble demeanor,\nThe world witnessed his numinous traces.\nMaster Guo on the turtle’s back longed to return—\nThe master spoke of himself thus.\nDaoist Peng still awaited enlightenment—\nThis was Peng Chongyang.\n\nFor kalpas, I have been foolish and deluded,\nEntangled in habitual tendencies.\nSince gaining discernment,\nI have never measured my strength,\nIndulging in every inclination—\nOnly the Dao of immortals and Buddhas\nHave I not yet inquired into.\n\nMy senior, Yue Junsucan of Changsha’s official lineage, shared my passion,\nAnd we became friends despite the difference in age.\nI knew he was a dharma companion of Peng Chongyang and Hu Gucan,\nAll three having received the oral transmission of the Golden Elixir from Master Yuxi.\nOne day, as we conversed, I broached the subject,\nAnd he spoke with fervor, recounting his lifelong quest for friends and teachers,\nSparing neither body nor life.\nLater, he encountered Master Yuxi, who said,\n\"Our past friendship was but casual discourse and miscellaneous discussions.\nThe time for learning the Dao has its own season and cause.\nNow that you have reached this point, the time is ripe!\"\nHe bade me wait for an auspicious day to transmit the teachings.\nThus, in the *chen* hour of the *jiazi* day,\nHe secretly imparted a few words,\nAnd I tentatively practiced.\nWithin a month, the elixir’s efficacy was verified—\nThe so-called golden radiance suffusing the body,\nJasper towers and crimson palaces,\nDragon and tiger, infant and maiden,\nAll fleetingly appearing in vision.\nWhen Yue heard of this, he sighed, wiping away tears:\n\"Since I first heard the Dao,\nMy body and temperament have been afflicted,\nUnable to settle my steps.\nThus, in the work of advancing the fire, I have yet to begin.\"",
