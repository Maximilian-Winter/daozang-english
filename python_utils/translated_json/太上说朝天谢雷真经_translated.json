  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Lord’s Scripture of Facing Heaven and Atoning for Thunder**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Lord’s Scripture of Facing Heaven and Atoning for Thunder*\n**Author:** Unknown\n**Volume:** One\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Benwen* Category\n\n---\n\nIn the first year of the Dragon-Han era, the Heavenly Worthy, dwelling in the Floating-Ro world, observed that among sentient beings there were those who disbelieved in the Three Treasures and committed the Five Transgressions. After their bodies perished, they sank into the Three Wretched Realms, forever falling into hell as hungry ghosts. Some violated the Heavenly Precepts, and upon examination, were falsely accused by the underworld officials. All sentient beings endured myriad sufferings, yet knew not the gate of atonement and absolution. When the fruits of their karma ripened, they incurred severe illnesses and thunderstrikes. After death, they were forever consigned to the realms of hungry ghosts and beasts, their souls tormented, calamities befalling them—how deeply lamentable! With no means of deliverance, they remained ignorant that Heaven’s scrutiny records violations of the Heavenly Precepts, leading to the thirty-six thunderstrike offenses, of which the world knows nothing.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, therefore, expounded *The Scripture of Facing Heaven and Atoning for Thunder* in thirty-six precepts, enabling people to pray and atone. Thus, their transgressions would be known, and the retribution of karmic fruits made manifest. Such consequences—how could they not be agonizing?\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy proclaimed the Heavenly Precepts, commanding reverence for Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, and the spirits; loyalty to rulers and filial piety to parents. He revealed the path of karmic causes and conditions in past lives, showing that facing Heaven to atone for sins would surely invoke responsive communion. One should invite Orthodox Unity Daoist priests to perform rites—whether in temples or at home—according to their means, conducting liturgies to absolve sins and pray for longevity.\n\nThe Void-Space Investigating Envoys would then memorialize these supplications, transmitting them to the Heavenly Bureaus. Sins would be eradicated, blessings and prosperity augmented, and meritorious deeds perfected, thereby descending auspiciousness.\n\nThe fortunes and misfortunes of mortals are all governed by the Heavenly Courts—how could one remain ignorant of this? This scripture is treasured by Heaven and not transmitted to the lower worlds. Heavenly beings revere it, and the myriad sages guard it—its golden texts and numinous verses. Those who disbelieve shall forever fall into Fengdu.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy revealed the talismans of karmic retribution and the celestial script, clarifying that those struck by thunder for violating the Heavenly Precepts could be examined with these talismans and texts. Thus, ordinary people would recognize the Heavenly Worthy’s responsiveness, and the teachings would be thus established.\n\n---\n\n**The Twelve Heavenly Thunder Precepts:**\n1. Disloyalty to the sovereign,\n2. Unfiliality to parents,\n3. Disrespect for the Three Treasures,\n4. Discarding the Five Grains,\n5. Cursing wind and rain,\n6. Baring oneself beneath the Three Luminaries,\n7. Promoting evil and concealing good,\n8. Deviating from the true Dao,\n9. Ignorance of Heaven and Earth,\n10. Belief in sorcerers and malevolent spells,\n11. Destroying others’ karmic fruits,\n12. Defacing scriptures and teachings.\n\nViolating these Heavenly Precepts invokes the scrutiny of Heavenly Thunder.\n\nThese twelve precepts are proclaimed to instruct the people below, that they may know the path of atonement.\n\n---\n\n**The Twelve Earthly Thunder Precepts:**\n1. Defiling water and broth,\n2. Discharging filth into rivers,\n3. Reviling elders and superiors,\n4. Doubting the truth and refusing faith,\n5. Disrespecting teachers and forgetting one’s roots,\n6. Drying undergarments in the open,\n7. Seducing others’ wives and daughters,\n8. Increasing wickedness,\n9. Breaking vows before the sacred,\n10. Resenting clan and kin,\n11. Failing to relieve the poor and greedy,\n12. Lying before Heaven.\n\nThese twelve precepts fall under the jurisdiction of Earthly Thunder, revealed to instruct the people below and illuminate the path of repentance and atonement.\n\n---\n\n**The Twelve Human Thunder Precepts:**\n1. Spoiling the Five Grains,\n2. Using large scales and small measures,\n3. Raising prices during famines,\n4. Adulterating rice with water,\n5. Deceiving and obscuring others,\n6. Uttering filthy and divisive speech,\n7. Using false measures of length,\n8. Exploiting and harming others,\n9. Bullying the good and fearing the wicked,\n10. Failing to repay long-standing debts,\n11. Scheming to take others’ concubines,\n12. Slaughtering living beings for meat and wine.\n\nThese twelve precepts are governed by Human Thunder. The world knows them not, yet they are revealed to instruct the people below, that they may know the path of atonement.\n\n---\n\n**The Twelve Heavenly Thunder Lords:**\n1. Divine Empyrean Thunder Duke,\n2. Five Directions Thunder Duke,\n3. Rain-Bringing Thunder Duke,\n4. Wind-Bringing Thunder Duke,\n5. Cloud-Bringing Thunder Duke,\n6. Blessing-Bestowing Thunder Duke,\n7. Cloud-Moving Thunder Duke,\n8. Hail-Bringing Thunder Duke,\n9. Flying Sand Thunder Duke,\n10. Demon-Eating Thunder Duke,\n11. Ghost-Swallowing Thunder Duke,\n12. Demon-Subduing Thunder Duke.\n\nThese twelve Thunder Dukes are apportioned to Heaven. Violating Heaven’s decrees requires propitiating them to avert thunderstrike punishments.\n\n---\n\n**The Twelve Earthly Thunder Lords:**\n1. Rectifying Goodness Thunder Duke,\n2. Punishing Evil Thunder Duke,\n3. Earth God Thunder Duke,\n4. Rice-Sprouting Thunder Duke,\n5. Four Seasons Thunder Duke,\n6. Disaster-Averting Thunder Duke,\n7. Poison-Collecting Thunder Duke,\n8. Disease-Healing Thunder Duke,\n9. Aiding the Perilous Thunder Duke,\n10. Great Ascension Thunder Duke,\n11. Heaven-Patrolling Thunder Duke,\n12. Earth-Inspecting Thunder Duke.\n\nThese twelve Thunder Dukes are apportioned to Earth. When mortals commit earthly sins, they may burn incense, pray to Heaven, and confess their transgressions to avert the causes of calamity—no prayer shall go unanswered.\n\n---\n\n**The Twelve Human Thunder Lords:**\n1. Epidemic-Collecting Thunder Duke,\n2. Toxin-Seizing Thunder Duke,\n3. Harm-Removing Thunder Duke,\n4. Calamity-Averting Thunder Duke,\n5. Mountain-Sealing Thunder Duke,\n6. Temple-Destroying Thunder Duke,\n7. Ghost-Striking Thunder Duke,\n8. Tiger-Subduing Thunder Duke,\n9. Miasma-Breaking Thunder Duke,\n10. Corpse-Annihilating Thunder Duke,\n11. Monster-Eradicating Thunder Duke,\n12. Soul-Governing Thunder Duke.\n\nThese twelve Thunder Dukes are apportioned to humanity. When mortals commit human sins, they may burn incense and petition the Dipper, praying sincerely to avert these sufferings—such is the great virtue of the Dao’s love for life.\n\n---\n\nThe Dao declares: These thirty-six Thunder Lords weigh the gravity of good and evil. Revering them ensures no violation of the precepts, thereby descending auspiciousness. Failing to honor them leads to transgressions and severe punishments—poverty and hardship in the yang realm, unending suffering. Those who persist in disbelief shall fall into hell as ghosts. Upon rebirth, if struck by thunder, they become ghosts in the Northern Fengdu, finding no escape from torment—how could this not be agonizing?\n\nNorthern Fengdu contains one hundred and twenty hells, each with its wardens, jailers, venomous tigers, poisonous snakes, rabid dogs, and mountains of blade-like peaks. The jailers drive the sinners with rods, forcing them to climb the blade-mountains, their bodies entwined by venomous serpents. Their flesh is pierced by blades, blood flowing in streams, devoured by ravenous beasts. They die and revive ten thousand times, without respite day or night.\n\nThese are the retributions that sinners brought upon themselves in life, now fallen into Northern Fengdu—impossible to recount in full, their words too dreadful to utter. Briefly, nine great Daoist paths are revealed herein to expound this sutra, that all worldly beings may know fear. Should one incur such karmic causes and face yang-realm retribution, one may, according to one’s means, burn incense and sincerely implore Heaven and Earth, beseeching forgiveness for past transgressions to avert karmic consequences.\n\nIf men or women suffer poverty in this life, they may also cultivate the mind and rectify conduct, reciting and transmitting this sutra to atone for bodily misdeeds, dispel hardship, and naturally receive Heaven’s protection.\n\nThe Great Dao’s teachings are not to be taken lightly, nor should they be carelessly divulged. This text is a hidden scripture of Heaven, to be revered by all. Wherever this sutra resides, six Marshal Guardians of the Sutra, fourteen Divine Officers, one myriad and five hundred Heavenly Soldiers, local Earth Gods, and the City Gods governing the nine provinces—along with Wind Masters and boundary deities—stand guard. They protect this sutra, and those who recite and transmit it shall see demonic spirits annihilated.\n\nThose who receive it in life shall enjoy peace and prosperity; those who receive it in death shall ascend to the Southern Palace. Emperors, kings, queens, consorts, ministers, and officials may also recite this sutra to pray for abundant harvests, ensuring the well-being of all within their domains, four seasons of harmony, and eternal freedom from adversaries.\n\nThe Dao declares: Should any advanced practitioner seeking immortality venture into medicinal gardens and encounter venomous snakes, tigers, wolves, or other ferocious beasts, let them swiftly recite this sutra, and the malevolent creatures shall return to their primal state, unable to cause harm, naturally retreating. Thus may one obtain true elixirs, advance in Daoist cultivation, and comprehend the original source, thereby gaining the companionship of virtuous scholars, their minds attuned to the profound mysteries—nothing shall fail to respond.\n\nIn times of scorching drought, reciting this sutra may dispel the calamity of parched lands. When locusts damage crops, burning incense and reciting this sutra shall exterminate their kind and neutralize their poison. Should floods overflow and erode the land, swiftly reciting this sutra shall cause the waters to recede, preventing further inundation.\n\nFor all afflictions of pestilence, miasma, and epidemics that persist year after year, or for hauntings by malevolent ghosts, corpses, demons, and specters that cannot be expelled, burning incense and reciting this sutra shall dissolve such malevolence, preventing harm and restoring peace.\n\nWherever this sutra arrives, the ten thousand spirits stand in attendance, while demonic forces flee in concealment, not daring to lift their gaze—such is its awe-inspiring power.\n\nShould one transgress the laws of Heaven, retribution shall be inscribed in celestial script. Those struck by thunder may find such script upon their backs, chests, flanks, hands, or feet. By examining the celestial seals within this sutra, one may discern the responses of the Most High. Then, burning incense and inviting a Zhengyi Daoist priest to recite this sutra, one may move the corpse, beseeching the Thunder Gods for mercy. Only then may the body be placed in a coffin, sealed with planks save for a single aperture left open. The Thunder Gods shall not strike again, and the coffin may be interred. The same applies to livestock.\n\nThose who revere this sutra shall not violate its precepts, and in life after life, they shall enjoy ever-increasing wealth and longevity. Those who disrespect it shall be reported by the Recording Angels of Good and the Enforcing Ministers of Evil to the Heavenly Court. As their transgressions accumulate and their offenses fill the statutes, an imperial decree shall be issued, and the City Gods shall execute the sentence. After their demise, they shall be consigned to Northern Fengdu, never to escape.\n\nCelestial seals shall be inscribed to warn the living. All must revere and believe—none should remain ignorant.\n\n[List of transgressions and karmic retributions:]\nRice mixed with water, famine driving up prices, karma spanning three lifetimes, slandering the Three Treasures, filial impiety, karmic consequences, unfulfilled causes and effects, divination errors, the Nine Dark Realms, grave evils in excess, sins sufficient for nine generations of retribution, accumulated wickedness, exposing the Three Luminaries, verbal and physical misdeeds, improper conduct, karmic retribution from past lives, Heaven’s judgment, unspeakable and unseen offenses, regional misfortunes, un-Daoist acts, celestial revelations, nine true grave offenses, sins reaching their limit, celestial censure, karmic consequences spanning four generations, insatiable greed, eightfold wrath, transgressions of speech, Heaven’s scrutiny, past-life evil karma, Heaven’s ordained retribution, karmic consequences of past causes, ninefold karmic sins, fully accumulated karma, all offenses filling the statutes, Heaven’s demand for retribution, unprincipled conduct, sins reaching their limit, ninefold accumulated karma, perverting truth with falsehood, self-inflicted retribution, ninefold evil consequences, nine-sevenfold sins, Heaven’s examination of transgressions, nine-ninefold sins, sins of speech, fivefold rebellious offenses, five generations of evil, fourfold perverse thoughts.\n\nThe Dao declares: Should any mortal be struck by lightning, let this talismanic seal be used to verify the karmic retribution. Burning incense and reciting this sutra may resolve the corpse’s stagnation and dispel the celestial script. Lay the body upon the ground, then use cinnabar and vermilion on yellow paper, wielding the brush as instructed. Place the talisman upon the coffin, inscribing the seal to align with the celestial patterns. Chant the sacred name of the Nine Heavens’ Responding Thunder, Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy ten thousand times, then turn the corpse—it shall stir and enter the coffin. Proceed with burial, and such divine responses shall be evident. How could one fail to recognize the severity of Heaven’s laws?\n\nRegular recitation of this sutra can dispel all suffering. Even in death from grave illness, one shall not pass through hell. Official calamities, slander, years of hardship and debt, journeys through bandit-infested lands, or encounters with venomous snakes, tigers, wolves, and other perils—merely reciting this sutra shall ensure no harm befalls one.\n\nIn times of distress or peril, recitation of this sutra shall purify the household, bringing peace and tranquility to all kin. When constructing or breaking ground, erecting beams or building dwellings, or repairing walls and enclosures—wherever one may offend the divine killers—when conducting funerals and burials, where one may violate the dragon-killing spirits of the tomb, or in any matter of departure or cessation, simply burn fine incense and recite this true sutra in repentance. All gods shall naturally withdraw, unable to harm the living.\n\nShould sorcerers or shamans bury names for curses or perform blood sacrifices with slaughtered fowl; or if in temples or at unorthodox altars, they inscribe the names of the living; or if, due to improper adherence to rituals, or disputes over fields, gardens, wealth, or slander, they invoke curses upon names in various places—those who know the source may burn incense and recite this sutra to dispel the summoned malevolent ghosts seeking retribution. In severe cases, the officials and envoys of this sutra shall, without awaiting the celestial laws, annihilate their forms; in lighter cases, they shall be admonished. This divine power can eradicate all evils: mountain demons, specters, *chimei* and *fushi* ghosts, wandering spirits of the wrongfully dead, and the hundred demonic spirits that harm the living, provoke disasters, and claim lives. For those afflicted with chronic illness or enduring years of suffering, or for spirits seeking blood offerings at desolate mountain altars, which later bring epidemics—none can be dispelled. Yet by burning fine incense and invoking the Heavenly Marshal Generals of the Divine Empyrean, the celestial officials, and the guardian generals of this sutra, and reciting this scripture, demonic entities shall retreat into concealment, unable to harm human lives.\n\nWhen traveling at night, carry this true sutra in a silk pouch. It shall repel waterborne and terrestrial evil spirits, and the *wangliang* gods shall not dare to harm one’s soul and life, forcing such malevolent beings into concealment, never to harm again.\n\nThis celestial scripture is bestowed to enlighten the people below, allowing them to recognize their karmic roots and understand the teachings established by the Most High. In all myriad calamities, reciting this true sutra shall bring unfailing protection, rectifying all evil, manifesting the blessings of the Dao, and revealing boundless divine power.\n\nFormerly, Marshal Deng of Thunderclap practiced austerities on Jade Bamboo Mountain for fifty-two years. He memorialized the Jade Emperor, expounding on the mandate of Heaven to civilize, uphold the teachings, and deliver humanity. He vowed to eradicate the disloyal and unfilial, severing the demonic forces that harm people and creatures, ensuring no malevolent spirits bring calamity. Once his merit and conduct were perfected, he was summoned by the Emperor on High, who bestowed upon him a golden elixir. Upon consuming it, he transformed into a phoenix, adorned with wings, and was appointed as the Swift-Fire Decree Great Divinity, receiving a pair of golden hammers. Standing ten feet tall, with crimson hair and a blue body, his hands and feet bore phoenix talons. He was charged with executing the disloyal and unfilial, vanquishing demonic haunts, and all beings that harm the people. The fifth day of the fifth lunar month at noon was designated as his ascension day. His merits accomplished, he has been revered to this day, spanning countless kalpas.\n\nYet people disregard this deity, violating Heaven’s laws, accumulating sins until they face his divine judgment and execution. Their souls are consigned to the Northern Feng, forever trapped in the ghostly realm, unable to escape for ten thousand myriad kalpas. Such retribution is manifest in the law of cause and effect. People persist in violating these decrees, and once condemned, what remorse can avail? How grievous it is!\n\nIn this world, people fail to revere the Three Treasures, Heaven and Earth, sovereign and parents, teachers and friends, and those of the true Dao. Yet by examining this sutra, calming the spirit in silence, burning incense to worship Heaven and Earth, and reciting this scripture in a serene place, one may deeply reflect and repent, fostering reverence for the body. How could one not be tainted by myriad defilements? One must introspect on the transgressions of the self to seek liberation.\n\nIf one’s accumulated deeds result in being struck by lightning and suffering in the Northern Feng, who shall absolve such torment? The burden of such retribution is clear. Thus, people in this world ought to cherish and protect their bodies.\n\nWhen a woman is pregnant and past her due month, unable to give birth—whether due to possession by non-human spirits, vengeful ghosts, or specters from desolate mountain altars masquerading as humans to harm the mother, causing unbearable pain—knowing this cause, one may burn incense, face east, and chant the sacred name of the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation forty-nine times before reciting this sutra. The child shall then be delivered, and myriad gods shall oversee the birth, granting the child both fortune and wisdom. If it is a vengeful ghost, the generals of this sutra shall seize and dispatch it to the Northern Feng, where it shall be born as a dead corpse. As the corpse descends, prepare several bundles of chestnut wood, inscribe the name of the great deity upon them, and pray to Heaven, declaring: “From this day forth, release all enmity, and harm no living souls.”\n\nFor those plagued by official misfortunes, slander, or years of unresolved hardship, reciting this true sutra until the end shall dispel calamities, and its efficacy shall be unfailing. When renovating or altering the orientation of a household, or breaking ground, one may unwittingly offend the killing gods, inviting disaster and illness, leaving the home unsettled. In all such cases of offense, invite a Daoist priest to perform rites, invoking the celestial mandate and inscribing the names of the Seven True Lords of the Great Sage on yellow paper with cinnabar. Place it in the afflicted direction, recite this sutra, and its efficacy shall be unfailing. The household shall be purified and radiant, blessed by the protection of the gods.\n\nThe Dao emerged from the primordial mystery before the division of the Two Modes. Among all things, humanity is foremost.\n\nEven creatures that crawl and birds that fly know the seasons; how could the beings of the four times be otherwise? Heaven and Earth display their luminosity to instruct humanity. Responding to the appointed time, they bring forth life and nourish the world. How can one who lives in this world fail to repay the boundless grace of Heaven and Earth?\n\nAll people in the world ought to revere Heaven and Earth, sovereign and parents, teachers and friends, the true Dao, Buddhas, monastics, and arhats. Through meritorious deeds and virtuous karma, they uphold and propagate the teachings, guiding both humans and gods. Those who begin with goodness shall receive the protection of benevolent spirits. Should they later turn to evil, they will incur karmic retribution, fall into hell, and endure suffering through countless kalpas—rebirth as a human will then be distant indeed. Even if they regain human form, they may be born into poverty and lowliness, and if they still fail to cultivate propriety, they will drift ever further away. Without encountering sagely verification, they will never find the supreme Dharma-bridge to ferry them from the realms of suffering. Passing through lifetimes in ignorance, they may fall into the destinies of beasts, trapped in the six paths of samsara. Once sunk into the depths, liberation becomes nearly impossible.\n\nThe Dao declares: to encounter this sutra is the fruition of past good deeds, accumulated over countless kalpas, a fortunate convergence with celestial patterns. If a scholar of earnest aspiration sees this true sutra, enlightenment dawns at first hearing. But should a worldly person see it and respond with disbelief or slander, they will fall into lower forms of existence in life after life, growing ever more distant from the Great Dao.\n\nYet if one recites and cultivates this sutra from beginning to end, then after death, they shall not pass through the courts of hell. Their soul, clutching this sutra, will maintain right awakening in every thought, ascending to the Southern Palace and the Vermilion Numinous Fire Realm, where they undergo refinement moment by moment, free from all karmic adversaries.\n\nPeople in the world, while alive, indulge in bodily pleasures, singing and drinking to their delight, unaware that joy is the root of suffering. They ceaselessly pursue profit, not realizing that pleasure is the eye of sorrow. They travel north and south as merchants, oblivious to the biting frost of winter that withers trees like autumn. If the root is firm, spring will come. But those who do not follow the fundamental Way of humanity walk the path to death.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy expounds this true sutra so that people may awaken, return to the true Dao, and recognize their original source, thereby escaping the bonds of samsara. In this life, they shall enjoy long years, attaining excellence among humans, and with each turn, they shall advance in diligence. Their names shall be recorded in the registers of the Immortal Capital. When their virtuous karma and meritorious deeds are complete, the myriad spirits shall surround and protect them. Through liberation in the body, they shall ascend as immortals, transcending the celestial ranks, and be promoted to office before the Celestial Emperor.\n\nThis sutra is profound and weighty, beyond all conception—one must approach it with reverence. But those who treat the boundless precepts with contempt, harboring disbelief and failing to uphold them, shall after death dwell forever in the Northern Feng, where remorse will come too late. Guard this teaching well, for its blessings are not trifling.\n\nAt that moment, as the Heavenly Worthy was about to conclude the sutra, dragon-crane immortals and the myriad sages and perfected beings came to receive him. As he rose from his seat, the demon kings of all heavens, along with the spirits of humans and ghosts, received the Dharma precepts and decrees.\n\nThis sutra, disseminated to instruct the people below, may they awaken to their origin, know their root, and tread the path of life’s glory—never to be born in the realm of the Wayless. It dissolves the dust and debts of past lives, relieving suffering and sorrow. Those who encounter it must uphold it; it must not be lightly disclosed. The transgression shall be measured by the mysterious statutes, and its retribution shall be clear—beware and take heed.\n\n*The Supreme’s Sutra of the Heavenly Departure and Thunder Perfected Truth*\nThe August Emperor Lord inscribed his praise:\n\nIn reverence, humans and gods abide—blessings are not trifling.\nCreation harmonizes with virtue; the turning of fate inclines toward dawn.\nThunder follows one’s will, vowing to save and nourish life.\nIt eradicates evil and decay, aiding the foundation of Heaven’s work.\nEncompassing the glory of the myriad Dharmas, its transformations are beyond thought.\nReverence brings compliance; the Dao flourishes and the precepts are preserved.\nDefiance invokes fierce vows—later regrets cannot be recalled.\nOn Bamboo Mountain, cultivation meets response, and celestial transformation follows.\nIt slays wicked creatures, extinguishing their rebellious forms.\nIt brings forth the myriad things, decisively resolving the hidden and obscure.\nOf a thousand forms and ten thousand kinds, all are governed and returned to the root.\nLet none disbelieve—light and heavy transgressions are swiftly judged.\nOnce the human body perishes, how can it be reconsidered?\nSeek the joy of immortality’s principle; recite this scripture always.\nFirst cultivate the ancient covenant, then ascend the ladder of self-deliverance.\nLike a new craftsman carving a mountain, a single strike shapes the awl.\nUniversally transform through reverence and compliance—boundless as the chrysanthemum.\n\n*The Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Tower’s Manifested Body* composed this poem:\n\nI am the Lord of Teachings, mightily ruling the Northern Heaven.\nI distinguish humans from ghosts; the marshals take precedence.\nThe sacred hosts of the Thunder Department hold all authority.\nThey execute the fierce and wicked, reducing them to dust and smoke.\n\n*The Heavenly Lord of the Three Mao’s Perfect Practices Fulfilled* composed this poem:\n\nHeaven’s commands display might to the humble folk;\nlet them preserve integrity to protect themselves.\nAverting disaster and resolving calamities—observe the scripture’s proof.\nThe hammer and chisel are dedicated to punishing the five kinds of rebels.\n\n*The August Emperor of the Nine Heavens, the Numinous and Responsive Heavenly Lord of Zitong* inscribed this ode:\n\nThe Way of Heaven blesses the good and dooms the licentious;\nthunder’s killing and punishing awaken the human heart.\nI now manifest transformation to inspire awe,\nthat all living beings may avoid profound transgression.\n\nAnother ode:\n\nManifesting transformation to guide the people back to the true teaching,\nI reveal the Emperor’s virtue and the heart of cherishing life.\nThe court’s worthy ones, in devotion, engrave it on blocks,\nprinting and disseminating the *Thunder Sutra* to proclaim its jade-like sound.\n\nAnother ode:\n\nHeaven’s commands and decrees warn and admonish the common folk.\nThose who know no fear merely accumulate the seeds of misfortune.\nThe statutes are clearly displayed to destroy the body.\nIf one can reflect on one’s faults,\nthe divine watch over them.\nDelivering people from all calamities, the scripture’s teachings are fully expounded.\nThe court’s worthy ones, in their publication and dissemination,\ngather blessings and prosperity.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord of the Azure Emperor:\n\nI am the fierce marshal of thunder,\nrewarding the good and punishing the wicked,\nshowing no mercy to slanderers, the disloyal, or the unfilial.\nSuddenly, thunder and fire erupt, incinerating all the treacherous and evil.\nThose who incur the wrath of Heaven and Earth shall be reported to the Supreme Emperor and their forms annihilated.\n\nSince there exists the *Sutra of Atonement for Thunder* and its incantations,\nlet all people recite them to accumulate karmic causes,\ntransmitting the principles of the living Dao.\nThose who, out of devotion, renounce wealth to publish this true sutra—\nif they abide by it and violate no heavenly laws—\nshall enjoy warmth, fullness, and peace in clothing and food.\n\n*Lei Hong’s Summons.*\nI append this praise to the sutra, inscribed in sincerity and tranquility.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Lord’s Scripture of Facing Heaven and Atoning for Thunder**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Lord’s Scripture of Facing Heaven and Atoning for Thunder*\n**Author:** Unknown\n**Volume:** One\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Benwen* Category\n\n---\n\nIn the first year of the Dragon-Han era, the Heavenly Worthy, dwelling in the Floating-Ro world, observed that among sentient beings there were those who disbelieved in the Three Treasures and committed the Five Transgressions. After their bodies perished, they sank into the Three Wretched Realms, forever falling into hell as hungry ghosts. Some violated the Heavenly Precepts, and upon examination, were falsely accused by the underworld officials. All sentient beings endured myriad sufferings, yet knew not the gate of atonement and absolution. When the fruits of their karma ripened, they incurred severe illnesses and thunderstrikes. After death, they were forever consigned to the realms of hungry ghosts and beasts, their souls tormented, calamities befalling them—how deeply lamentable! With no means of deliverance, they remained ignorant that Heaven’s scrutiny records violations of the Heavenly Precepts, leading to the thirty-six thunderstrike offenses, of which the world knows nothing.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, therefore, expounded *The Scripture of Facing Heaven and Atoning for Thunder* in thirty-six precepts, enabling people to pray and atone. Thus, their transgressions would be known, and the retribution of karmic fruits made manifest. Such consequences—how could they not be agonizing?\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy proclaimed the Heavenly Precepts, commanding reverence for Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, and the spirits; loyalty to rulers and filial piety to parents. He revealed the path of karmic causes and conditions in past lives, showing that facing Heaven to atone for sins would surely invoke responsive communion. One should invite Orthodox Unity Daoist priests to perform rites—whether in temples or at home—according to their means, conducting liturgies to absolve sins and pray for longevity.\n\nThe Void-Space Investigating Envoys would then memorialize these supplications, transmitting them to the Heavenly Bureaus. Sins would be eradicated, blessings and prosperity augmented, and meritorious deeds perfected, thereby descending auspiciousness.\n\nThe fortunes and misfortunes of mortals are all governed by the Heavenly Courts—how could one remain ignorant of this? This scripture is treasured by Heaven and not transmitted to the lower worlds. Heavenly beings revere it, and the myriad sages guard it—its golden texts and numinous verses. Those who disbelieve shall forever fall into Fengdu.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy revealed the talismans of karmic retribution and the celestial script, clarifying that those struck by thunder for violating the Heavenly Precepts could be examined with these talismans and texts. Thus, ordinary people would recognize the Heavenly Worthy’s responsiveness, and the teachings would be thus established.\n\n---\n\n**The Twelve Heavenly Thunder Precepts:**\n1. Disloyalty to the sovereign,\n2. Unfiliality to parents,\n3. Disrespect for the Three Treasures,\n4. Discarding the Five Grains,\n5. Cursing wind and rain,\n6. Baring oneself beneath the Three Luminaries,\n7. Promoting evil and concealing good,\n8. Deviating from the true Dao,\n9. Ignorance of Heaven and Earth,\n10. Belief in sorcerers and malevolent spells,\n11. Destroying others’ karmic fruits,\n12. Defacing scriptures and teachings.\n\nViolating these Heavenly Precepts invokes the scrutiny of Heavenly Thunder.\n\nThese twelve precepts are proclaimed to instruct the people below, that they may know the path of atonement.\n\n---\n\n**The Twelve Earthly Thunder Precepts:**\n1. Defiling water and broth,\n2. Discharging filth into rivers,\n3. Reviling elders and superiors,\n4. Doubting the truth and refusing faith,\n5. Disrespecting teachers and forgetting one’s roots,\n6. Drying undergarments in the open,\n7. Seducing others’ wives and daughters,\n8. Increasing wickedness,\n9. Breaking vows before the sacred,\n10. Resenting clan and kin,\n11. Failing to relieve the poor and greedy,\n12. Lying before Heaven.\n\nThese twelve precepts fall under the jurisdiction of Earthly Thunder, revealed to instruct the people below and illuminate the path of repentance and atonement.\n\n---\n\n**The Twelve Human Thunder Precepts:**\n1. Spoiling the Five Grains,\n2. Using large scales and small measures,\n3. Raising prices during famines,\n4. Adulterating rice with water,\n5. Deceiving and obscuring others,\n6. Uttering filthy and divisive speech,\n7. Using false measures of length,\n8. Exploiting and harming others,\n9. Bullying the good and fearing the wicked,\n10. Failing to repay long-standing debts,\n11. Scheming to take others’ concubines,\n12. Slaughtering living beings for meat and wine.\n\nThese twelve precepts are governed by Human Thunder. The world knows them not, yet they are revealed to instruct the people below, that they may know the path of atonement.\n\n---\n\n**The Twelve Heavenly Thunder Lords:**\n1. Divine Empyrean Thunder Duke,\n2. Five Directions Thunder Duke,\n3. Rain-Bringing Thunder Duke,\n4. Wind-Bringing Thunder Duke,\n5. Cloud-Bringing Thunder Duke,\n6. Blessing-Bestowing Thunder Duke,\n7. Cloud-Moving Thunder Duke,\n8. Hail-Bringing Thunder Duke,\n9. Flying Sand Thunder Duke,\n10. Demon-Eating Thunder Duke,\n11. Ghost-Swallowing Thunder Duke,\n12. Demon-Subduing Thunder Duke.\n\nThese twelve Thunder Dukes are apportioned to Heaven. Violating Heaven’s decrees requires propitiating them to avert thunderstrike punishments.\n\n---\n\n**The Twelve Earthly Thunder Lords:**\n1. Rectifying Goodness Thunder Duke,\n2. Punishing Evil Thunder Duke,\n3. Earth God Thunder Duke,\n4. Rice-Sprouting Thunder Duke,\n5. Four Seasons Thunder Duke,\n6. Disaster-Averting Thunder Duke,\n7. Poison-Collecting Thunder Duke,\n8. Disease-Healing Thunder Duke,\n9. Aiding the Perilous Thunder Duke,\n10. Great Ascension Thunder Duke,\n11. Heaven-Patrolling Thunder Duke,\n12. Earth-Inspecting Thunder Duke.\n\nThese twelve Thunder Dukes are apportioned to Earth. When mortals commit earthly sins, they may burn incense, pray to Heaven, and confess their transgressions to avert the causes of calamity—no prayer shall go unanswered.\n\n---\n\n**The Twelve Human Thunder Lords:**\n1. Epidemic-Collecting Thunder Duke,\n2. Toxin-Seizing Thunder Duke,\n3. Harm-Removing Thunder Duke,\n4. Calamity-Averting Thunder Duke,\n5. Mountain-Sealing Thunder Duke,\n6. Temple-Destroying Thunder Duke,\n7. Ghost-Striking Thunder Duke,\n8. Tiger-Subduing Thunder Duke,\n9. Miasma-Breaking Thunder Duke,\n10. Corpse-Annihilating Thunder Duke,\n11. Monster-Eradicating Thunder Duke,\n12. Soul-Governing Thunder Duke.\n\nThese twelve Thunder Dukes are apportioned to humanity. When mortals commit human sins, they may burn incense and petition the Dipper, praying sincerely to avert these sufferings—such is the great virtue of the Dao’s love for life.\n\n---\n\nThe Dao declares: These thirty-six Thunder Lords weigh the gravity of good and evil. Revering them ensures no violation of the precepts, thereby descending auspiciousness. Failing to honor them leads to transgressions and severe punishments—poverty and hardship in the yang realm, unending suffering. Those who persist in disbelief shall fall into hell as ghosts. Upon rebirth, if struck by thunder, they become ghosts in the Northern Fengdu, finding no escape from torment—how could this not be agonizing?\n\nNorthern Fengdu contains one hundred and twenty hells, each with its wardens, jailers, venomous tigers, poisonous snakes, rabid dogs, and mountains of blade-like peaks. The jailers drive the sinners with rods, forcing them to climb the blade-mountains, their bodies entwined by venomous serpents. Their flesh is pierced by blades, blood flowing in streams, devoured by ravenous beasts. They die and revive ten thousand times, without respite day or night.",

      "translated_text": "These are the retributions that sinners brought upon themselves in life, now fallen into Northern Fengdu—impossible to recount in full, their words too dreadful to utter. Briefly, nine great Daoist paths are revealed herein to expound this sutra, that all worldly beings may know fear. Should one incur such karmic causes and face yang-realm retribution, one may, according to one’s means, burn incense and sincerely implore Heaven and Earth, beseeching forgiveness for past transgressions to avert karmic consequences.\n\nIf men or women suffer poverty in this life, they may also cultivate the mind and rectify conduct, reciting and transmitting this sutra to atone for bodily misdeeds, dispel hardship, and naturally receive Heaven’s protection.\n\nThe Great Dao’s teachings are not to be taken lightly, nor should they be carelessly divulged. This text is a hidden scripture of Heaven, to be revered by all. Wherever this sutra resides, six Marshal Guardians of the Sutra, fourteen Divine Officers, one myriad and five hundred Heavenly Soldiers, local Earth Gods, and the City Gods governing the nine provinces—along with Wind Masters and boundary deities—stand guard. They protect this sutra, and those who recite and transmit it shall see demonic spirits annihilated.\n\nThose who receive it in life shall enjoy peace and prosperity; those who receive it in death shall ascend to the Southern Palace. Emperors, kings, queens, consorts, ministers, and officials may also recite this sutra to pray for abundant harvests, ensuring the well-being of all within their domains, four seasons of harmony, and eternal freedom from adversaries.\n\nThe Dao declares: Should any advanced practitioner seeking immortality venture into medicinal gardens and encounter venomous snakes, tigers, wolves, or other ferocious beasts, let them swiftly recite this sutra, and the malevolent creatures shall return to their primal state, unable to cause harm, naturally retreating. Thus may one obtain true elixirs, advance in Daoist cultivation, and comprehend the original source, thereby gaining the companionship of virtuous scholars, their minds attuned to the profound mysteries—nothing shall fail to respond.\n\nIn times of scorching drought, reciting this sutra may dispel the calamity of parched lands. When locusts damage crops, burning incense and reciting this sutra shall exterminate their kind and neutralize their poison. Should floods overflow and erode the land, swiftly reciting this sutra shall cause the waters to recede, preventing further inundation.\n\nFor all afflictions of pestilence, miasma, and epidemics that persist year after year, or for hauntings by malevolent ghosts, corpses, demons, and specters that cannot be expelled, burning incense and reciting this sutra shall dissolve such malevolence, preventing harm and restoring peace.\n\nWherever this sutra arrives, the ten thousand spirits stand in attendance, while demonic forces flee in concealment, not daring to lift their gaze—such is its awe-inspiring power.\n\nShould one transgress the laws of Heaven, retribution shall be inscribed in celestial script. Those struck by thunder may find such script upon their backs, chests, flanks, hands, or feet. By examining the celestial seals within this sutra, one may discern the responses of the Most High. Then, burning incense and inviting a Zhengyi Daoist priest to recite this sutra, one may move the corpse, beseeching the Thunder Gods for mercy. Only then may the body be placed in a coffin, sealed with planks save for a single aperture left open. The Thunder Gods shall not strike again, and the coffin may be interred. The same applies to livestock.\n\nThose who revere this sutra shall not violate its precepts, and in life after life, they shall enjoy ever-increasing wealth and longevity. Those who disrespect it shall be reported by the Recording Angels of Good and the Enforcing Ministers of Evil to the Heavenly Court. As their transgressions accumulate and their offenses fill the statutes, an imperial decree shall be issued, and the City Gods shall execute the sentence. After their demise, they shall be consigned to Northern Fengdu, never to escape.\n\nCelestial seals shall be inscribed to warn the living. All must revere and believe—none should remain ignorant.\n\n[List of transgressions and karmic retributions:]\nRice mixed with water, famine driving up prices, karma spanning three lifetimes, slandering the Three Treasures, filial impiety, karmic consequences, unfulfilled causes and effects, divination errors, the Nine Dark Realms, grave evils in excess, sins sufficient for nine generations of retribution, accumulated wickedness, exposing the Three Luminaries, verbal and physical misdeeds, improper conduct, karmic retribution from past lives, Heaven’s judgment, unspeakable and unseen offenses, regional misfortunes, un-Daoist acts, celestial revelations, nine true grave offenses, sins reaching their limit, celestial censure, karmic consequences spanning four generations, insatiable greed, eightfold wrath, transgressions of speech, Heaven’s scrutiny, past-life evil karma, Heaven’s ordained retribution, karmic consequences of past causes, ninefold karmic sins, fully accumulated karma, all offenses filling the statutes, Heaven’s demand for retribution, unprincipled conduct, sins reaching their limit, ninefold accumulated karma, perverting truth with falsehood, self-inflicted retribution, ninefold evil consequences, nine-sevenfold sins, Heaven’s examination of transgressions, nine-ninefold sins, sins of speech, fivefold rebellious offenses, five generations of evil, fourfold perverse thoughts.\n\nThe Dao declares: Should any mortal be struck by lightning, let this talismanic seal be used to verify the karmic retribution. Burning incense and reciting this sutra may resolve the corpse’s stagnation and dispel the celestial script. Lay the body upon the ground, then use cinnabar and vermilion on yellow paper, wielding the brush as instructed. Place the talisman upon the coffin, inscribing the seal to align with the celestial patterns. Chant the sacred name of the Nine Heavens’ Responding Thunder, Universal Transformation Heavenly Worthy ten thousand times, then turn the corpse—it shall stir and enter the coffin. Proceed with burial, and such divine responses shall be evident. How could one fail to recognize the severity of Heaven’s laws?\n\nRegular recitation of this sutra can dispel all suffering. Even in death from grave illness, one shall not pass through hell. Official calamities, slander, years of hardship and debt, journeys through bandit-infested lands, or encounters with venomous snakes, tigers, wolves, and other perils—merely reciting this sutra shall ensure no harm befalls one.",

When constructing or breaking ground, erecting beams or building dwellings, or repairing walls and enclosures—wherever one may offend the divine killers—when conducting funerals and burials, where one may violate the dragon-killing spirits of the tomb, or in any matter of departure or cessation, simply burn fine incense and recite this true sutra in repentance. All gods shall naturally withdraw, unable to harm the living.\n\nShould sorcerers or shamans bury names for curses or perform blood sacrifices with slaughtered fowl; or if in temples or at unorthodox altars, they inscribe the names of the living; or if, due to improper adherence to rituals, or disputes over fields, gardens, wealth, or slander, they invoke curses upon names in various places—those who know the source may burn incense and recite this sutra to dispel the summoned malevolent ghosts seeking retribution. In severe cases, the officials and envoys of this sutra shall, without awaiting the celestial laws, annihilate their forms; in lighter cases, they shall be admonished. This divine power can eradicate all evils: mountain demons, specters, *chimei* and *fushi* ghosts, wandering spirits of the wrongfully dead, and the hundred demonic spirits that harm the living, provoke disasters, and claim lives. For those afflicted with chronic illness or enduring years of suffering, or for spirits seeking blood offerings at desolate mountain altars, which later bring epidemics—none can be dispelled. Yet by burning fine incense and invoking the Heavenly Marshal Generals of the Divine Empyrean, the celestial officials, and the guardian generals of this sutra, and reciting this scripture, demonic entities shall retreat into concealment, unable to harm human lives.\n\nWhen traveling at night, carry this true sutra in a silk pouch.

In all myriad calamities, reciting this true sutra shall bring unfailing protection, rectifying all evil, manifesting the blessings of the Dao, and revealing boundless divine power.\n\nFormerly, Marshal Deng of Thunderclap practiced austerities on Jade Bamboo Mountain for fifty-two years. He memorialized the Jade Emperor, expounding on the mandate of Heaven to civilize, uphold the teachings, and deliver humanity. He vowed to eradicate the disloyal and unfilial, severing the demonic forces that harm people and creatures, ensuring no malevolent spirits bring calamity. Once his merit and conduct were perfected, he was summoned by the Emperor on High, who bestowed upon him a golden elixir. Upon consuming it, he transformed into a phoenix, adorned with wings, and was appointed as the Swift-Fire Decree Great Divinity, receiving a pair of golden hammers. Standing ten feet tall, with crimson hair and a blue body, his hands and feet bore phoenix talons. He was charged with executing the disloyal and unfilial, vanquishing demonic haunts, and all beings that harm the people. The fifth day of the fifth lunar month at noon was designated as his ascension day. His merits accomplished, he has been revered to this day, spanning countless kalpas.\n\nYet people disregard this deity, violating Heaven’s laws, accumulating sins until they face his divine judgment and execution. Their souls are consigned to the Northern Feng, forever trapped in the ghostly realm, unable to escape for ten thousand myriad kalpas. Such retribution is manifest in the law of cause and effect. People persist in violating these decrees, and once condemned, what remorse can avail? How grievous it is!\n\nIn this world, people fail to revere the Three Treasures, Heaven and Earth, sovereign and parents, teachers and friends, and those of the true Dao. Yet by examining this sutra, calming the spirit in silence, burning incense to worship Heaven and Earth, and reciting this scripture in a serene place, one may deeply reflect and repent, fostering reverence for the body. How could one not be tainted by myriad defilements? One must introspect on the transgressions of the self to seek liberation.\n\nIf one’s accumulated deeds result in being struck by lightning and suffering in the Northern Feng, who shall absolve such torment? The burden of such retribution is clear. Thus, people in this world ought to cherish and protect their bodies.\n\nWhen a woman is pregnant and past her due month, unable to give birth—whether due to possession by non-human spirits, vengeful ghosts, or specters from desolate mountain altars masquerading as humans to harm the mother, causing unbearable pain—knowing this cause, one may burn incense, face east, and chant the sacred name of the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation forty-nine times before reciting this sutra. The child shall then be delivered, and myriad gods shall oversee the birth, granting the child both fortune and wisdom. If it is a vengeful ghost, the generals of this sutra shall seize and dispatch it to the Northern Feng, where it shall be born as a dead corpse. As the corpse descends, prepare several bundles of chestnut wood, inscribe the name of the great deity upon them, and pray to Heaven, declaring: “From this day forth, release all enmity, and harm no living souls.”\n\nFor those plagued by official misfortunes, slander, or years of unresolved hardship, reciting this true sutra until the end shall dispel calamities, and its efficacy shall be unfailing. When renovating or altering the orientation of a household, or breaking ground, one may unwittingly offend the killing gods, inviting disaster and illness, leaving the home unsettled. In all such cases of offense, invite a Daoist priest to perform rites, invoking the celestial mandate and inscribing the names of the Seven True Lords of the Great Sage on yellow paper with cinnabar. Place it in the afflicted direction, recite this sutra, and its efficacy shall be unfailing. The household shall be purified and radiant, blessed by the protection of the gods.\n\nThe Dao emerged from the primordial mystery before the division of the Two Modes. Among all things, humanity is foremost.",
      "overlap_context": "enter the coffin. Proceed with burial, and such divine responses shall be evident. How could one fail to recognize the severity of Heaven’s laws?\n\nRegular recitation of this sutra can dispel all suffering. Even in death from grave illness, one shall not pass through hell. Official calamities, slander, years of hardship and debt, journeys through bandit-infested lands, or encounters with venomous snakes, tigers, wolves, and other perils—merely reciting this sutra shall ensure no harm befalls one.",

      "translated_text": "Even creatures that crawl and birds that fly know the seasons; how could the beings of the four times be otherwise? Heaven and Earth display their luminosity to instruct humanity. Responding to the appointed time, they bring forth life and nourish the world. How can one who lives in this world fail to repay the boundless grace of Heaven and Earth?\n\nAll people in the world ought to revere Heaven and Earth, sovereign and parents, teachers and friends, the true Dao, Buddhas, monastics, and arhats. Through meritorious deeds and virtuous karma, they uphold and propagate the teachings, guiding both humans and gods. Those who begin with goodness shall receive the protection of benevolent spirits. Should they later turn to evil, they will incur karmic retribution, fall into hell, and endure suffering through countless kalpas—rebirth as a human will then be distant indeed. Even if they regain human form, they may be born into poverty and lowliness, and if they still fail to cultivate propriety, they will drift ever further away. Without encountering sagely verification, they will never find the supreme Dharma-bridge to ferry them from the realms of suffering. Passing through lifetimes in ignorance, they may fall into the destinies of beasts, trapped in the six paths of samsara. Once sunk into the depths, liberation becomes nearly impossible.\n\nThe Dao declares: to encounter this sutra is the fruition of past good deeds, accumulated over countless kalpas, a fortunate convergence with celestial patterns. If a scholar of earnest aspiration sees this true sutra, enlightenment dawns at first hearing. But should a worldly person see it and respond with disbelief or slander, they will fall into lower forms of existence in life after life, growing ever more distant from the Great Dao.\n\nYet if one recites and cultivates this sutra from beginning to end, then after death, they shall not pass through the courts of hell. Their soul, clutching this sutra, will maintain right awakening in every thought, ascending to the Southern Palace and the Vermilion Numinous Fire Realm, where they undergo refinement moment by moment, free from all karmic adversaries.\n\nPeople in the world, while alive, indulge in bodily pleasures, singing and drinking to their delight, unaware that joy is the root of suffering. They ceaselessly pursue profit, not realizing that pleasure is the eye of sorrow. They travel north and south as merchants, oblivious to the biting frost of winter that withers trees like autumn. If the root is firm, spring will come. But those who do not follow the fundamental Way of humanity walk the path to death.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy expounds this true sutra so that people may awaken, return to the true Dao, and recognize their original source, thereby escaping the bonds of samsara. In this life, they shall enjoy long years, attaining excellence among humans, and with each turn, they shall advance in diligence. Their names shall be recorded in the registers of the Immortal Capital. When their virtuous karma and meritorious deeds are complete, the myriad spirits shall surround and protect them. Through liberation in the body, they shall ascend as immortals, transcending the celestial ranks, and be promoted to office before the Celestial Emperor.\n\nThis sutra is profound and weighty, beyond all conception—one must approach it with reverence. But those who treat the boundless precepts with contempt, harboring disbelief and failing to uphold them, shall after death dwell forever in the Northern Feng, where remorse will come too late. Guard this teaching well, for its blessings are not trifling.",
