  "full_translation": "*The Kinship of the Three in Accordance with the Zhou Changes*\n\nThe Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the Changes, the father and mother of all hexagrams. Kan and Li frame their enclosure, turning the hub and aligning the axle.\n\nThe four hexagrams of the female and male serve as bellows and pipes, covering and veiling the Dao of yin and yang. Like a master charioteer, they hold to the marking line, grasp the reins and bit, align the compass and square, and follow the wheel tracks. Abiding in the center, they govern what lies without. Their reckoning is kept in the pitch-pipes and calendrical records. The lunar phases have five and six, warp and weft attend the sun’s command, and together they make sixty. The firm and yielding have outer and inner.\n\nAt dawn of the new moon, *Zhun* takes up its duty; by dusk, *Meng* receives its charge. Day and night each have their hexagram, used in due sequence. Before the month’s end, when darkness gives way to dawn, the cycle concludes and begins anew. The sun and stars set the measure; movement and stillness have their early and late.\n\nSpring and summer rely on the inner body, from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*. Autumn and winter turn to outer use, from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*. Rewards and punishments accord with spring and autumn; dusk and dawn follow cold and heat. The line statements hold benevolence and righteousness, releasing joy and anger in due season. Thus they respond to the four seasons, and the Five Phases attain their principle.\n\nHeaven and Earth establish their positions, and the Changes move within them. Heaven and Earth are the images of Qian and Kun. Establishing positions means arranging the stations where yin and yang are paired. The Changes speak of Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. These two functions have no fixed line positions; they circulate through the six voids. Coming and going are not fixed; above and below are also without constancy. Hidden and submerged, they transform within, enfolding the myriad things and serving as the warp and woof of the Dao.\n\nBy nonbeing they govern being; the vessel’s use lies in its emptiness. Thus, in tracing waxing and waning, Kan and Li vanish and perish.\n\nWords are not idly fashioned; theories do not arise in vain. They draw on verification and evidence, measuring and comparing with spirit illumination. They infer categories and structure graphs, taking the original principles as proof. Kan is the essence of the moon, *wu*; Li is the radiance of the sun, *ji*. Sun and moon are the Changes; the firm and yielding are matched. Earth rules the four seasons, weaving the beginning and end. Blue, red, white, and black each dwell in their quarter, all receiving from the central palace the work of *wu* and *ji*.\n\nThe Changes are images. Among suspended images, none are more luminous than the sun and moon. Exhausting the spirit, one knows transformation. When yang departs, yin arrives; spokes gather and the wheel turns. Emerging and entering, they coil and uncoil. The Changes have three hundred and eighty-four lines. Based on the lines, one selects the tally. The tally refers to the sixty-four hexagrams. From the dark of the moon to dawn of the new moon, *Zhen* comes to receive the tally. At this moment, Heaven and Earth mingle their essences; sun and moon mutually grasp and hold. The male yang scatters its dark offering; the female yin transforms the yellow womb. Chaos intermingles; the root foundation is planted. Cultivating and nourishing the bud, concentrating the spirit to form the body, the multitude tread forth, and none that wriggle and move do not proceed from this.\n\nThus Confucius praised the Primal Chaos: \"The virtue of Qian and Kun pervades the void.\" Investigating antiquity, he matched the primordial sovereign. The *Guan Ju* establishes the beginning. The marriage cap and sash intertwine their qi; the first year then sprouts and flourishes.\n\nThe sage is not born in vain. Above, he observes the manifest celestial tally. The celestial tally has advance and retreat, bending and stretching in response to the seasons. Thus the Changes unify the mind of Heaven.\n\nThe *Fu* hexagram establishes the beginning of sprouting. The eldest son succeeds the father’s body; relying on the mother, he sets the initial foundation. Waning and waxing respond to the bell and pitch-pipe; ascent and descent rely on the pivot of the Dipper. On the third day, it emerges as dawn. *Zhen* and *Geng* receive the west. On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *Ding*; the first quarter is level as a cord. On the fifteenth, the stem’s body is complete; fullness abounds in *Jia* of the east. The toad and the hare’s soul—sun and moon’s qi shine doubly bright. The toad gazes at the hexagram’s node; the hare spews forth its radiance. The seventh and eighth lines’ path is complete; bending and curving, they descend.\n\nOn the sixteenth, the turning receives its mandate. *Xun* and *Xin* appear in the level dawn. *Gen* points straight to *Bing* in the south. The last quarter is the twenty-third; *Kun* and *Yi* on the thirtieth day. In the northeast, it loses its companion. When the node is exhausted, they mutually yield. The succeeding body then gives birth to the dragon again.\n\n*Ren* and *Gui* pair with *Jia* and *Yi*; Qian and Kun encompass the beginning and end. Seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six also correspond. These four combine to make thirty. The yang qi seeks extinction and concealment. The eight trigrams array their luminaries; their movement shifts without losing the center.\n\nThe primal essence is subtle and hard to perceive. One infers and measures, verifying with tally and proof. Abiding, one observes its image; by analogy, one models its form. Setting up markers as standards, one divines and determines good and ill fortune. Issuing commands in accord with the seasons, one does not miss the time of the moving lines. Above, one examines the patterns of the *River Chart*; below, one orders the flows of earth’s forms. In the center, one investigates the human mind, comparing and considering the Three Powers. In movement, one follows the hexagram’s nodes; in stillness, one relies on the hexagram’s judgment. Qian and Kun are put into practice, and then Heaven and Earth are ordered. Can one fail to be cautious?\n\nAt the outset of governing, one grasps the subtle and dense. Opening and spreading, one displays the treasure, holding fast to the essential Dao’s handle and pivot, unifying transformation’s warp and woof. The line images move within; good and ill fortune arise without. The five planets interweave in sequence, responding to the seasons’ stimuli. When the four and seven are perverse and contrary, they separate and unite, bow and rise.\n\n*Wenchang* oversees the records, interrogating and holding accountable the terrace and assistants. The hundred officials and functionaries each govern their departments.\n\nThe sun combines the essence of the Five Phases; the moon receives the record of the six pitch-pipes. Five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, they begin anew. Tracing the beginning and grasping the end, one holds the thread of survival and extinction. If the ruler is arrogant and excessive, overbearing and full, he violates the Dao. If the minister is devious and obsequious, his conduct does not follow the track, the waxing and waning of the crescent and full moon go awry, and perverse changes bring ill fortune. Enforcing the law, one admonishes and criticizes, interrogating transgressions and leaving them to the ruler.\n\nThe Pole Star receives its rectitude, at ease and yielding to what lies below. The Bright Hall promulgates governance; the state has no harmful Dao. Within, one nourishes oneself, calm and empty of desire. Tracing the root and grasping the origin, one inwardly illuminates the body’s form. Closing and sealing its orifices, one fortifies the numinous root. The Three Luminaries sink into obscurity; one warms and nourishes the child-pearl. Though unseen to the eye, it is near and easy to seek.\n\n---\n\nThe Yellow Center gradually permeates the principles, moistening and nourishing to reach the skin. At first rectified, then finally cultivated—once the stem is established, the end may be upheld. The One is thus concealed, unknown to the world.\n\nThe supreme virtue acts without contrivance, not seeking through scrutiny. The lesser virtue labors, its function unceasing. When the upper is sealed, it is called \"being\"; when the lower is sealed, it is called \"non-being.\" Non-being serves the upper, where the numinous virtue resides. These two apertures follow the method: the qi of Metal also requires the other.\n\nTo know the white and guard the black is to invite the advent of spirit clarity. The white is the essence of Metal; the black is the foundation of Water. Water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named One—the inception of yin and yang. The profound contains the Yellow Sprout, master of the Five Metals, the River Chariot of the North. Thus lead appears black without, yet harbors golden radiance within. Cloaked in coarse cloth, jade is concealed; outwardly, one seems a madman.\n\nMetal is the mother of Water; the mother conceals the child’s embryo. Water is the child of Metal; the child shelters within the mother’s womb. The Perfected One is most wondrous, as if present, as if absent—vaguely resembling the great abyss, now sinking, now floating. Withdrawing, they disperse and spread, each guarding their own domain.\n\nGathered, it resembles the white; refined, it becomes vermilion. Tempered, it forms the protective guard, with white within and steadfastness dwelling at the core. Square or round, a span in diameter, blended yet mutually constrained.\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth took form, it stood majestic and exalted.\nEncircled by walls and gates, it resembles Penglai’s isle.\nAll around, barriers seal fast—four paths yet hesitant to tread.\nGuardianship is firm and tight, barring all deceit and evil.\nWinding chambers connect within, a warning against the unforeseen.\nHere, no need for anxious thought, nor room for sorrow’s toil.\nThe chamber brims with spirit and qi, yet none can detain them.\nThose who preserve it flourish; those who lose it perish.\nIn motion and stillness, rest and wakefulness, it ever attends mankind.\n\nThis is no method of the hidden treasuries.\nInward vision stirs reflection; pacing steps trace the lunar lodges.\nThe Six Jia follow the celestial stems, while the Yin Way suppresses nine with one.\nChaos disturbs the primordial womb; ingesting qi sets the bowels rumbling.\nExhale the true, inhale the external evil; day and night, sleep never comes.\nFrom dark to new moon, never a pause—body wearies by the day,\nbewildered, seeming half-mad. The hundred vessels seethe and race,\ndenied the clarity of stillness. Piling earth to raise altars,\nmorning and evening they reverently sacrifice. Ghostly forms appear,\nhaunting dreams with sighs. The heart rejoices, the mind delights,\nself-assured of long life—yet suddenly death claims them,\ntheir bodies left to rot and decay. Every action brings error,\nperverse and awry, losing the pivot of the Way.\nSuch doctrines abound, a thousand strands, ten thousand more,\nall retreating from the Yellow and the Old, twisting against the Nine Capitals.\n\nThe wise discern their intent, suddenly grasping the source.\nDiligent in practice, day and night without rest,\nafter three years of ingestion, they ascend lightly on distant journeys.\nFire cannot scorch them; water cannot drench.\nThey master presence and absence, ever joyful, free from care.\nThe Dao is perfected, virtue complete—hidden, they await their time.\nThe Great One summons them, relocating to the Central Isles.\nWith merit fulfilled, they ascend, receiving registers and charts.\n\nThe *Fire Records* are no empty fabrication; the *Yi* expounds them clearly.\nThe crescent moon shapes the crucible and furnace; the White Tiger governs the refining pivot.\nMercury, the sun’s flowing pearl, is joined by the Azure Dragon.\nRaising the East to meet the West, hun and po naturally unite.\nThe waxing crescent, Dui’s number eight; the waning crescent, Gen’s eight as well.\nWhen the two crescents merge their essence, the body of Qian and Kun is formed.\nTwo eights make one *jin*; the Dao of the *Yi* stands firm and unshaken.\nA *zhu* holds three hundred eighty-four, matching the hexagrams’ lines.\n\nGold enters fierce fire, yet its luster remains undiminished.\nSince the dawn of creation, sun and moon have never lost their brightness.\nGold does not forfeit its weight; sun and moon retain their forms.\nGold is born from the moon, at new moon receiving the sun’s tally.\nGold returns to its mother; at moon’s end, sun and moon embrace.\nConcealing its frame, it sinks into the cavernous void.\nGold regains its original nature; the crucible’s radiance shines anew.\n\nThe numbers of Zi and Wu combine to three; Wu and Ji are called five.\nWhen three and five harmonize, the Eight Stones serve as the guiding principle.\nBreath and thought crave each other, lingering as husband and wife.\nYellow earth is gold’s father; flowing pearl, water’s mother.\nWater treats earth as its ghost; earth subdues water’s rise.\nThe Vermilion Bird is fire’s essence, holding balance to weigh victory and defeat.\nWhen water prevails, fire is extinguished.\n\nAll perish and return to the thick earth.\nWhen the Three Natures unite, their original essence shares a common ancestor.\n\nSesame still prolongs life; returning cinnabar may be taken by mouth.\nGold’s nature never decays, thus it is the treasure of all things.\nAlchemists ingest it, and their lifespan is long.\nEarth travels through the four seasons, guarding its boundaries and setting its rules.\nGolden sand enters the five viscera, dispersing like mist or rain.\nSteaming through the four limbs, complexion becomes bright and fair.\nWhite hair turns black again; fallen teeth regrow in their old place.\nOld men regain youthful vigor; aged women become maidens.\nTransformed in form, they escape worldly calamities—these are called Perfected Persons.\n\nLead powder cast into fire changes color and reverts to lead.\nIce and snow warmed by hot water dissolve into the Great Mystery.\nGold takes cinnabar as its master, harmonizing with mercury.\nTransformation arises from its true nature; beginning and end follow one another.\nTo become an immortal through ingestion, one must use substances of the same kind.\nPlant millet to grow millet; hatch chickens with their own eggs.\nLike supports the natural, and things form easily.\nFish eyes are not pearls; fleabane does not become catalpa.\nLike follows like; discordant things do not yield treasure.\nThus, swallows and sparrows do not bear phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses.\nWater does not flow upward in flames; fire does not moisten downward.\n\nThe world abounds with scholars, men of lofty talent.\nYet chance meetings elude them, and their fires consume their wealth.\nClinging to texts, they follow words blindly, imposing their own interpretations.\nTheir threads lack cause or connection; their measures lose control.\nThey pound chalcanthite, mica, arsenolite, and sulfur, burning camphorwood.\nThey mix and smelt, flying in confusion.\nThey blow bellows over malachite, using it as a pivot.\nMixed natures of different kinds—how can they dwell as one?\nA thousand attempts yield ten thousand failures; seeking cunning, they become fools.\nFortune never favors them, for only the sage truly knows.\nFrom youth to white-haired age, midway they grow doubtful.\nTurning from the Way, they cling to delusion, stepping from the right path into crooked byways.\nPeering through a tube, their vision is narrow; they cannot gauge what lies ahead.\n\nAs for the utmost sages, none surpass Fu Xi.\nHe first drew the Eight Trigrams, modeling Heaven and Earth.\nKing Wen, ancestor of emperors, structured the hexagrams and composed their judgments.\nConfucius, the near-sage hero, added the Ten Wings to aid them.\nThese three lords were Heaven’s chosen, rising in succession to govern their times.\nThough their ranks differ, their merit and virtue are not unequal.\nTheir works follow in succession, weighing and measuring with care.\nThe tangible is easy to reckon; the formless is hard to plan.\nTheir deeds set models for emulation, establishing the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* for the world.\nWithout innate foresight, each grasped truth through their teachers.\nBright as lifting the curtain, they opened their eyes and ascended the high terrace.\n\nThe *Fire Canon* spans six hundred chapters, yet its aims are not diverse.\nIts words are solemnly expounded, but people do not ponder deeply.\nTracing its source, darkness and light originally dwell together.\nI speak discreetly to the wise—how dare I treat this lightly in writing?\nIf I were to seal my lips in silence, cutting off the Way, I would incur guilt and punishment.\nYet to inscribe my thoughts on bamboo and silk risks leaking Heaven’s tally.\nHesitating, I sigh, bowing my head to record this folly.\nRefinement has its methods; I cannot bear to lay them all bare.\nI sketch only the guiding principles; the branches and leaves will appear in due course.\n\nUse gold as a dike; let water enter and flow freely.\nGold’s reckoning is fifteen; water’s number is the same.\nBefore the furnace, fix the weights: water exceeds by five parts.\nBoth are taken as true; gold’s weight remains as at first.\nThe third does not enter; fire accompanies the two.\nThe three substances unite and receive one another, transforming mightily like spirits.\nBelow lies the qi of Great Yang, steaming in an instant.\nFirst it liquefies, then congeals—this is called the Yellow Chariot.\nAs years and months draw to an end, nature is destroyed, and lifespan harmed.\nThe body becomes ash and earth, like dust on a bright window.\n\nPound and blend them, then hold them through the vermilion gate.\nSeal their meeting firmly, striving for perfect solidity.\nKindle fire below, day and night, its sound steady and diligent.\nBegin with the civil, end with the martial; at first, refine with care.\nIn the end, display martial force.\nObserve and tend with utmost caution, adjusting warmth and coolness.\nCycle through the twelve nodes; when one ends, attend closely again.\nWhen qi is exhausted and life nears its end, rest and death claim the soul.\nThe color shifts to purple, and suddenly returning cinnabar forms.\nGround to powder, shaped into a single pill, the spatula’s measure is most potent.\n\nExpounding the numbers of the Five Phases, concise yet not cumbersome:\nStrike fire with water, and its light is suddenly extinguished.\nSun and moon press upon each other, ever between darkness and dawn.\nWhen water prevails, Kan encroaches on Yang; when fire wanes, Li’s day grows dim.\nYin and Yang consume each other, their interaction the Way’s natural course.\n\nNames define reality; words arise from nature.\nWhen gold returns to its original nature, it is rightly called returning cinnabar.\nI do not dare speak falsely, but emulate the sages’ writings.\nAncient records speak of Dragon and Tiger; the Yellow Emperor praised golden blossoms.\nHuainan refined autumn stone; Wang Yang added yellow sprouts.\nThe worthy can uphold and practice this; the unworthy must not partake.\nThe Way of ancient and modern is one; in conversation, we voice our plans.\nScholars, exert yourselves, lingering in deep reflection.\nThe essential words are utterly plain, shining clearly without deceiving me.\n\nQian and Kun, hard and soft, embrace and enfold one another.\nYang bestows; Yin receives. Male and female depend on each other.\nThrough this, creation unfolds, and essence and qi spread forth.\nKan and Li crown the head, their radiance spreading.\nThe Dark and Mysterious are hard to fathom; they cannot be depicted in diagrams.\nThe sage measures and orders them, yet finds no foundation.\nThe four blend into chaos, entering directly into the formless.\nThe sixty-four hexagrams cycle, spread out as a chariot.\nDragon and horse are harnessed; the enlightened ruler guides the times.\nIn harmony, they follow; the path is level and not crooked.\nCrooked ways are perilous, toppling states and endangering nations.\n\nThe noble person dwells in his chamber; the words he utters are good.\n\nThen from a thousand *li* beyond, it responds.\n\nThis speaks of the lord of ten thousand chariots,\nwho dwells within the nine-fold chamber,\nissuing decrees and commands,\naccordant with the rhythms of Yin and Yang.\nHe stores his instruments and awaits the proper time,\nnever transgressing the hexagrams’ months:\n*Zhun* employs *zi* and *shen*;\n*Meng* uses *yin* and *xu*.\nThe remaining sixty hexagrams\neach have their appointed days.\n\nI merely set forth these two images,\nyet cannot exhaust their fullness.\nEstablish righteousness and institute punishments—\nbestow virtue where benevolence is due.\nThose who defy it meet misfortune;\nthose who follow it attain good fortune.\nFollow the calendar and its statutes,\nwith utmost sincerity and unwavering focus.\nCarefully observe the celestial stems and branches,\nscrutinizing the waxing and waning.\nEven the slightest deviation\nbrings regret and shame as thieves.\n\nAt the two solstices, the measures shift,\ndiscordant and convoluted.\nMidwinter brings scorching heat;\nmidsummer, frost and snow.\nAt the two equinoxes, alignment falters,\nfailing even by a moment’s measure.\nWinds and rains fall out of season;\nflood and drought contend.\nLocusts surge like boiling water,\nand manifold anomalies erupt.\nHeaven displays its omens:\nmountains collapse, the earth splits.\nThe filial son’s devotion\nmoves the august pole.\nWhat issues from his own mouth\nflows afar to distant lands.\n\nSome bring calamity,\nsome bring blessings,\nsome usher in great peace,\nsome provoke war and strife.\nThese four arise\nfrom the heart’s chamber.\n\nMovement and stillness follow constancy,\nadhering to their plumb line.\nThe four seasons align with their time,\nharmonizing with the qi.\nHard and soft are decisively set,\nnever encroaching upon each other.\nThe Five Phases guard their bounds,\nnever recklessly expanding or contracting.\nThe Changes flow in ceaseless circulation,\nbending and stretching, reversing and returning.\n\nBetween the dark and new moons,\nsigns converge at the center.\nPrimal chaos and vast obscurity,\nthe female and male follow one another.\nEssence and moisture nourish and moisten,\ndisseminating transformation in ceaseless flow.\nHeaven and earth, spirits and numina—\nbeyond all measure.\nUse them to secure the body,\nconcealing form in hiddenness.\nIt begins in the northeast,\nthe region of Winnowing Basket and Dipper.\nTurning rightward in revolution,\nit disgorges the wheel and spits forth the sprout.\nIn the hidden depths, images appear,\nscattering radiant essence and light.\n\nAbove the Pleiades and Net,\nthunder emerges as the omen.\nYang qi initiates its course—\nthe first nine, the hidden dragon.\nYang stands on three,\nyin opens through eight.\nThus, on the third day, thunder stirs;\non the eighth day, joy proceeds.\nThe second nine, the dragon appears—\npeaceful and luminous.\nWith the virtues of three and five complete,\nthe body of Qian is formed.\nThe third nine, vigilant at dusk,\ndiminishes the divine tally.\nProsperity and decline gradually shift,\nultimately returning to their origin.\nXun inherits its lineage,\nfirmly securing and upholding.\nThe fourth nine, perhaps leaping—\nadvancing and retreating, the Way is perilous.\nGen governs cessation and advance,\nforbidding transgression of the time.\nOn the twenty-third day,\nthe crescent moon is observed.\nThe fifth nine, the flying dragon—\nheaven’s position brings joy.\nThe sixth five, Kun submits,\nbinding beginning and end.\nNurturing the multitude of offspring,\nit becomes the mother of all kinds.\nThe ninth above, the exalted dragon—\nbattling virtue in the wilds.\nUsing the nine, soaring and fluttering,\nit becomes the compass of the Way.\nThe yang numbers now complete,\ncompletion then gives rise to renewal.\nPushing forth with feeling, uniting with nature,\nturning to join one another.\n\nFollowing the jade pivot’s revolution,\nascending and descending, rising and falling,\ncirculating through the six lines—\ndifficult to perceive.\nThus, it has no fixed position,\nyet stands as the ancestral founder of the Changes.\n\nAt the new moon’s dawn, Return—\nyang qi begins its flow.\nEntering and exiting without haste,\nerecting the gnomon, subtly firm.\nYellow Bell establishes the Zi month,\nits signs now manifest.\nDisseminating soft warmth,\nthe common people receive constancy.\n\nApproaching the furnace, applying the twigs—\nopening the path, correcting the light.\nThe radiance gradually advances,\nthe days grow ever longer.\nGreat Lü of the Chou month\nbinds and adjusts the high and low.\n\nLooking upward to form Peace—\nhard and soft flourish together.\nYin and yang intertwine,\nthe small departs, the great arrives.\nConverging at Yin,\nmoving in accord with the time.\n\nGradually passing through Great Strength,\nflanking the gate of Mao.\nElm pods fall,\nreturning to their root.\nPunishment and virtue bear one another,\nday and night begin their division.\n\nDecisiveness—yin retreats,\nyang ascends and advances.\nWashing and cleansing feathers and wings,\nshaking off the dust of slumber.\n\nQian, vigorous and resplendent,\nits influence spreading to the four neighbors.\nYang ends at Si,\ncentered, it interacts with others.\n\nGou begins the sequence,\ntreading frost first.\nThe well’s cold spring—\nWu is the Ruibin.\nThe guest submits to yin,\nyin becomes the host.\n\nWithdrawing from the worldly position,\ngathering and refining its essence.\nCherishing virtue, awaiting the time,\ndwelling in obscurity and darkness.\n\nObstruction—blocked and impassable,\nsprouts cannot emerge.\nYin extends, yang withdraws,\nyang’s name is lost.\n\nObserving its measures,\nexamining the autumnal equinox’s nature.\nNurturing the young and tender,\nthe old and withered flourish anew.\nShepherd’s purse and wheat sprout,\ngrowing beneath the cover.\n\nSplitting and rotting the limbs,\ndissolving and vanishing the form.\nThe transforming qi exhausted,\nthe utmost spirit is lost.\n\nThe Way exhausted, it turns back,\nreturning to Kun’s origin.\nEternally following earth’s patterns,\nreceiving heaven’s mandate to spread.\n\nMysterious, distant, and boundless,\nseparated yet connected.\nResponding to measure, nurturing life—\nthe origin of yin and yang.\nVast and indistinct,\nnone know its beginning.\nThose who first stray lose the path;\nthose who follow become lords.\nNo level ground without slope—\nsuch is the Way’s nature.\nChange and transformation ever flourish,\nwaxing and waning mutually dependent.\nEnding with Kun, beginning with Return,\never cycling in an unbroken ring.\nEmperors and kings receive and serve—\nenduring for a thousand generations.\n\nTo nurture one’s nature,\nprolong life, and forestall the end,\nconsider the future,\nbut first reflect on what came before.\nThe body one is endowed with\noriginates from primordial unity.\nPrimal essence spreads like clouds,\nborne by qi at the beginning.\n\nYin and yang serve as measures,\nthe dwelling of hun and po.\nYang spirit is the sun’s soul,\nyin spirit is the moon’s spirit.\nHun and po,\neach other’s dwelling.\nNature presides within,\nestablishing the inner enclosure.\nEmotion governs without,\nbuilding walls and outer ramparts.\nWhen walls and ramparts are complete,\npeople and things find peace.\nAt this time,\nemotion harmonizes with Qian and Kun.\nQian moves and straightens,\nqi spreads, essence flows.\nKun is still and receptive,\nbecoming the Way’s abode.\nThe hard applies and retreats,\nthe soft transforms and nourishes.\nNine returns, seven reverses,\neight returns, six resides.\nMale white, female red—\nmetal and fire restrain each other.\nWater then settles fire—\nthe beginning of the Five Phases.\nSupreme goodness resembles water,\npure and without flaw.\nThe Way’s form and image—\ntrue unity is hard to depict.\nTransforming and dispersing,\neach dwells in solitude.\n\nLike a hen’s egg,\nwhite and black align.\nA square inch in breadth,\nthis is the beginning.\nFour limbs, five viscera,\nsinews and bones all present.\nAfter ten months,\nit emerges from the womb.\nBones soft, pliable as silk,\nflesh smooth as lead.\n\nUsing the yang-burning mirror to capture fire—\nwithout the sun, no light is born.\nWithout the moon and stars, the square vessel—\nhow could it yield water or broth?\nThe two qi are dark and distant,\nyet their resonance and transformation still communicate.\nHow much more so the near and present body,\nintimately close to heart and breast?\nYin and yang pair with sun and moon,\nwater and fire serve as their proofs.\n\nEars, eyes, and mouth—the three treasures—\nfirmly seal them, do not let them loose.\nThe true person lurks in the deep abyss,\nfloating and wandering, guarding the compass’s center.\nTurning and bending to see and hear,\nopening and closing all in harmony.\nBecoming the pivot of oneself,\nmovement and stillness never exhausted.\nLi’s qi inwardly defends,\nKan then does not employ hearing.\nDui unites without speech,\nfew words accord with primal chaos.\nThe three now locked,\nthe body relaxes in an empty chamber.\nEntrusting the will to return to emptiness,\ntaking no-thought as constancy.\nAttaining the unshakable.\n\nThe heart, focused, does not stray;\nin sleep and waking, spirit embraces spirit.\nAwakening, one awaits the signs of presence or absence.\nThe countenance grows ever more moist,\nthe bones and joints ever more firm and strong.\nExpelling the host of yin’s perverse influences,\none then establishes the true yang.\nCultivating without cease or rest,\nthe qi of clouds and rain moves forth,\ndrizzling like spring’s gentle soak,\nflowing like ice’s slow dissolve.\nFrom the head it streams down to the feet,\nthen ultimately ascends again,\ncoming and going through the boundless void.\nSubtly it suffuses the body’s vessel.\n\nReversion is the Dao’s proof,\nsoftness is virtue’s handle.\nWeed and hoe the long-accumulated filth,\nand even the finest details become harmonious.\nThe turbid is the path to clarity,\nlong darkness yields to radiant light.\n\nYet people of the world favor petty arts,\nunable to discern the Dao’s depth or shallowness.\nAbandoning the true to follow deviant paths,\nthey seek speed but meet obstruction.\nLike the blind without their staff,\nlike the deaf straining to hear gong and shang,\nthey plunge into water to catch pheasant and hare,\nclimb mountains to seek fish and dragon,\nplant wheat hoping to harvest millet,\nor wield compasses to find squares.\nExhausting their strength and laboring their spirit,\nthroughout the year they see no success.\n\nTo know the method of ingesting the elixir,\nthe task is simple and not complex.\n\nThe pearl of the Great Yang\never seeks to leave the person.\nSuddenly obtaining the Golden Flower,\nit turns and interacts.\nTransformed into a white liquid,\nit congeals to utmost hardness.\nThe Golden Flower first intones,\nand in a brief moment,\ndissolves and becomes water,\nits veins like a horse’s teeth.\nYang then goes to harmonize,\nnature and essence in spontaneity.\nWhen yin presses close in time,\nconfined and bound at the gate of restraint,\nthe loving mother nurtures and nourishes,\nthe filial child repays kindness.\nThe stern father issues commands,\ninstructing and admonishing descendants.\nThe Five Phases contend for supremacy,\neach relying on the other to arise.\nFire’s nature melts metal,\nmetal fells wood to flourish.\nThe Three and Five with the One—\nthe essence of Heaven and Earth.\nThis may be transmitted by oral instruction,\nbut is difficult to convey in writing.\n\n---\n\nAt midnight, turn to the right;\nat noon, the sun wheels eastward.\nThe boundaries of dawn and dusk divide,\nestablishing the two names.\nThe Dragon calls to the Tiger,\nthe Tiger inhales the Dragon’s essence.\nEach feeds upon the other,\nboth covet the advantage.\nThus they interlock and swallow,\nchewing and devouring one another.\nWhen Mars guards the west,\nthe *Tai Ping Jing* traverses the heavens.\nWhere the killing qi descends,\nwhat can stand unshaken?\nThe wildcat guards the mouse,\nthe sparrow fears the goshawk.\nEach attains its function—\nwho dares utter a sound?\n\nWithout grasping the principle,\none must not speak recklessly.\nExhausting family wealth,\nwife and children starve in poverty.\nFrom ancient times to now,\ncountless have pursued this path,\nyet few meet

      "translated_text": "*The Kinship of the Three in Accordance with the Zhou Changes*\n\nThe Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the Changes, the father and mother of all hexagrams. Kan and Li frame their enclosure, turning the hub and aligning the axle.\n\nThe four hexagrams of the female and male serve as bellows and pipes, covering and veiling the Dao of yin and yang. Like a master charioteer, they hold to the marking line, grasp the reins and bit, align the compass and square, and follow the wheel tracks. Abiding in the center, they govern what lies without. Their reckoning is kept in the pitch-pipes and calendrical records. The lunar phases have five and six, warp and weft attend the sun’s command, and together they make sixty. The firm and yielding have outer and inner.\n\nAt dawn of the new moon, *Zhun* takes up its duty; by dusk, *Meng* receives its charge. Day and night each have their hexagram, used in due sequence. Before the month’s end, when darkness gives way to dawn, the cycle concludes and begins anew. The sun and stars set the measure; movement and stillness have their early and late.\n\nSpring and summer rely on the inner body, from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*. Autumn and winter turn to outer use, from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*. Rewards and punishments accord with spring and autumn; dusk and dawn follow cold and heat. The line statements hold benevolence and righteousness, releasing joy and anger in due season. Thus they respond to the four seasons, and the Five Phases attain their principle.\n\nHeaven and Earth establish their positions, and the Changes move within them. Heaven and Earth are the images of Qian and Kun. Establishing positions means arranging the stations where yin and yang are paired. The Changes speak of Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. These two functions have no fixed line positions; they circulate through the six voids. Coming and going are not fixed; above and below are also without constancy. Hidden and submerged, they transform within, enfolding the myriad things and serving as the warp and woof of the Dao.\n\nBy nonbeing they govern being; the vessel’s use lies in its emptiness. Thus, in tracing waxing and waning, Kan and Li vanish and perish.\n\nWords are not idly fashioned; theories do not arise in vain. They draw on verification and evidence, measuring and comparing with spirit illumination. They infer categories and structure graphs, taking the original principles as proof. Kan is the essence of the moon, *wu*; Li is the radiance of the sun, *ji*. Sun and moon are the Changes; the firm and yielding are matched. Earth rules the four seasons, weaving the beginning and end. Blue, red, white, and black each dwell in their quarter, all receiving from the central palace the work of *wu* and *ji*.\n\nThe Changes are images. Among suspended images, none are more luminous than the sun and moon. Exhausting the spirit, one knows transformation. When yang departs, yin arrives; spokes gather and the wheel turns. Emerging and entering, they coil and uncoil. The Changes have three hundred and eighty-four lines. Based on the lines, one selects the tally. The tally refers to the sixty-four hexagrams. From the dark of the moon to dawn of the new moon, *Zhen* comes to receive the tally. At this moment, Heaven and Earth mingle their essences; sun and moon mutually grasp and hold. The male yang scatters its dark offering; the female yin transforms the yellow womb. Chaos intermingles; the root foundation is planted. Cultivating and nourishing the bud, concentrating the spirit to form the body, the multitude tread forth, and none that wriggle and move do not proceed from this.\n\nThus Confucius praised the Primal Chaos: \"The virtue of Qian and Kun pervades the void.\" Investigating antiquity, he matched the primordial sovereign. The *Guan Ju* establishes the beginning. The marriage cap and sash intertwine their qi; the first year then sprouts and flourishes.\n\nThe sage is not born in vain. Above, he observes the manifest celestial tally. The celestial tally has advance and retreat, bending and stretching in response to the seasons. Thus the Changes unify the mind of Heaven.\n\nThe *Fu* hexagram establishes the beginning of sprouting. The eldest son succeeds the father’s body; relying on the mother, he sets the initial foundation. Waning and waxing respond to the bell and pitch-pipe; ascent and descent rely on the pivot of the Dipper. On the third day, it emerges as dawn. *Zhen* and *Geng* receive the west. On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *Ding*; the first quarter is level as a cord. On the fifteenth, the stem’s body is complete; fullness abounds in *Jia* of the east. The toad and the hare’s soul—sun and moon’s qi shine doubly bright. The toad gazes at the hexagram’s node; the hare spews forth its radiance. The seventh and eighth lines’ path is complete; bending and curving, they descend.\n\nOn the sixteenth, the turning receives its mandate. *Xun* and *Xin* appear in the level dawn. *Gen* points straight to *Bing* in the south. The last quarter is the twenty-third; *Kun* and *Yi* on the thirtieth day. In the northeast, it loses its companion. When the node is exhausted, they mutually yield. The succeeding body then gives birth to the dragon again.\n\n*Ren* and *Gui* pair with *Jia* and *Yi*; Qian and Kun encompass the beginning and end. Seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six also correspond. These four combine to make thirty. The yang qi seeks extinction and concealment. The eight trigrams array their luminaries; their movement shifts without losing the center.\n\nThe primal essence is subtle and hard to perceive. One infers and measures, verifying with tally and proof. Abiding, one observes its image; by analogy, one models its form. Setting up markers as standards, one divines and determines good and ill fortune. Issuing commands in accord with the seasons, one does not miss the time of the moving lines. Above, one examines the patterns of the *River Chart*; below, one orders the flows of earth’s forms. In the center, one investigates the human mind, comparing and considering the Three Powers. In movement, one follows the hexagram’s nodes; in stillness, one relies on the hexagram’s judgment. Qian and Kun are put into practice, and then Heaven and Earth are ordered. Can one fail to be cautious?\n\nAt the outset of governing, one grasps the subtle and dense. Opening and spreading, one displays the treasure, holding fast to the essential Dao’s handle and pivot, unifying transformation’s warp and woof. The line images move within; good and ill fortune arise without. The five planets interweave in sequence, responding to the seasons’ stimuli. When the four and seven are perverse and contrary, they separate and unite, bow and rise.\n\n*Wenchang* oversees the records, interrogating and holding accountable the terrace and assistants. The hundred officials and functionaries each govern their departments.\n\nThe sun combines the essence of the Five Phases; the moon receives the record of the six pitch-pipes. Five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, they begin anew. Tracing the beginning and grasping the end, one holds the thread of survival and extinction. If the ruler is arrogant and excessive, overbearing and full, he violates the Dao. If the minister is devious and obsequious, his conduct does not follow the track, the waxing and waning of the crescent and full moon go awry, and perverse changes bring ill fortune. Enforcing the law, one admonishes and criticizes, interrogating transgressions and leaving them to the ruler.\n\nThe Pole Star receives its rectitude, at ease and yielding to what lies below. The Bright Hall promulgates governance; the state has no harmful Dao. Within, one nourishes oneself, calm and empty of desire. Tracing the root and grasping the origin, one inwardly illuminates the body’s form. Closing and sealing its orifices, one fortifies the numinous root. The Three Luminaries sink into obscurity; one warms and nourishes the child-pearl. Though unseen to the eye, it is near and easy to seek.",

      "translated_text": "---\n\nThe Yellow Center gradually permeates the principles, moistening and nourishing to reach the skin. At first rectified, then finally cultivated—once the stem is established, the end may be upheld. The One is thus concealed, unknown to the world.\n\nThe supreme virtue acts without contrivance, not seeking through scrutiny. The lesser virtue labors, its function unceasing. When the upper is sealed, it is called \"being\"; when the lower is sealed, it is called \"non-being.\" Non-being serves the upper, where the numinous virtue resides. These two apertures follow the method: the qi of Metal also requires the other.\n\nTo know the white and guard the black is to invite the advent of spirit clarity.

Heaven and Earth—\nthe dark ravine spans ten thousand *li*.\nThe River Drum nears the Star Marker,\nand the people all tremble in fear.\nThe shadow’s reckless advance and retreat—\nnine years beset by calamity.\nThe August Emperor gazes upon it,\nand the king retreats to reform himself.\nThe bolt of the pass rises and falls—\nharmful *qi* scatters in flight.\nThe Yangtze and Huai run dry—\ntheir waters pour into the sea.\nHeaven and Earth’s male and female—\nthey linger between *zi* and *wu*.\n*Yin* and *yang*’s ancestors in *yin* and *shen*—\nthey emerge and enter, completing their cycle.\nFollowing the Dipper and the Beckoning Star,\nthey grasp the balance to fix the primal order.\n\n○ Ascending and roasting on Mount Zeng—\nflames spread below.\nThe White Tiger sings and leads ahead,\nwhile the Azure Fluid harmonizes behind.\nThe Vermilion Bird soars and falters—\nits flight displays five hues.\nEntangled in nets cast wide,\nit is pressed down, unable to rise.\nIts wails ring with sorrow—\nlike an infant longing for its mother.\nOverturned into the boiling cauldron,\nits feathers and plumage are crushed and broken.\nBefore half the clepsydra’s mark has passed,\nfish scales and manes arise.\nFive colors dazzle and gleam—\ntransformation has no constant master.\nThe seething cauldron boils over—\nviolent force knows no rest.\nLinked and layered in piles,\nlike interlocking canine teeth.\nIts form like midwinter ice—\nstalactites jut from its lattice.\nTowering and jumbled together,\nthey prop one another up.\n\n○ When *yin* and *yang* find their match,\nthey dwell in tranquil harmony.\nThe Green Dragon resides in the sixth chamber of *Fang*—\nspring blossoms shake in the eastern *mao*.\nThe White Tiger stands in the seventh star of *Mao*—\nautumn’s edge gleams in the western *you*.\nThe Vermilion Bird abides in the second star of *Zhang*—\ntrue *yang* blazes at the southern *wu*.\nAll three come to pay court—\ntheir kin become intimate companions.\nTheir root lies in but two things,\nyet their end becomes three and five.\nThree, five, and one together—\nall gather in two places.\nGovern them as the above method prescribes—\ncount the days and take the measure.\n\n○ First white, then yellow—\nconsuming black to penetrate within and without.\nThis is called the First Cauldron,\nits sustenance like grains of millet.\nWhat nature itself accomplishes—\nnot some devious or false path.\nAs when mountain and marsh *qi* steam together,\ngiving rise to clouds and rain.\nWhen mud dries, it becomes dust—\nwhen fire dies, it turns to earth.\nLike dyeing with indigo to make yellow,\nor woad to weave green silk.\nBoiling hides to make glue,\nor fermenting yeast to brew wine.\nKindred things readily yield their work—\nunrelated kinds defy craft.\nThis wondrous art alone—\nexamine it closely, it does not deceive.\nTransmitted to a hundred million generations hence,\nits brilliance will be self-evident.\nShining like the Milky Way’s starry script,\nradiant as the sea’s primal waters.\nPonder it until it is thoroughly mastered—\nturn it over, surveying above and below.\nAfter a thousand revolutions, it gleams resplendent—\nafter ten thousand repetitions, it may be seen.\nThe divine and numinous may reveal it to man—\nthe heart’s spirit suddenly awakens.\nProbe its beginning, seek its threads—\nyou will surely find its gate and door.\nThe Dao of Heaven favors none—\nit is ever passed to the worthy.\n\n○ The *Cantong Qi* expounds its outline,\nyet cannot maintain purity.\nIts discourse overflows,\nleaving subtle details incomplete.\nIts breadth is vague and approximate—\nnow I compile this record anew,\nfilling gaps and omissions,\npolishing its profound depths.\nDrawing connections to link them,\nits purport made uniform.\nIts aims unerring,\nI thus compose this,\narranging five corresponding types.\nThen the *Book of Changes*’ nature and essence are fully revealed.\n\n○ The *Book of Changes*’ nature and essence\neach conform to its measure.\nThe Yellow Emperor and Laozi delved deeply—\ntheir scrutiny yields mastery.\nThe work of the furnace and fire\nhas true grounds for its claims.\nThe Three Ways arise from one—\nall emerge from the same path.\n\n○ Branches, stems, flowers, and leaves—\nfruit hangs in abundance.\nThe truth lies in the root and trunk,\nnever losing its original essence.\nWhat the sincere heart speaks—\nexamined, it does not err.\n\n○ Like the midwinter season,\nwhen bamboo and trees all wither and break.\nAiding *yang*, the merchant caravans halt—\nthe lord of men retreats in seclusion.\nFollowing the season’s rhythm and its commands,\nhe seals his lips, speaking not.\nThe Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless—\nthe Great Mystery has no form.\nVoid and stillness cannot be seen—\nits frame and enclosure fade away.\nErrors and mistakes lose the thread of affairs—\nwords return to self-defeat.\nI distinguish these Four Images in sequence\nto enlighten later generations’ blindness.\n\n○ A rustic from Kuaiji,\na rotting life in a secluded valley.\nClinging to plainness and simplicity,\nunamused by splendor and glory.\nDwelling in obscurity and remoteness,\nheedless of profit and fame.\nHolding fast to tranquility and stillness,\nlonging for an age of peace.\nAt ease in quiet seclusion,\nhe composed this
