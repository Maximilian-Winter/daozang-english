  "full_translation": "**The Wondrous Scripture of the Five Marchmounts’ Ancient Original True Forms, with Preface**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Wondrous Scripture of the Five Marchmounts’ Ancient Original True Forms*\nOriginally attributed to Dongfang Shuo of the Han. Scholarly consensus places its composition between the late Han and Wei-Jin periods; Ge Hong’s *Baopuzi: \"Far-Off Excursions\"* already cites this work. One fascicle.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan Section*, *Category of Numinous Charts*.\n**See also:** *Seven Lots from the Cloudy Satchel*, Fascicle 79.\n\n**The Wondrous Scripture of the Five Marchmounts’ Ancient Original True Forms, with Preface**\nBy Dongfang Shuo\n\nThe true forms of the Five Marchmounts are the configurations of mountains and waters. Twisting and coiling, rising and falling, their heights and depths vary; long and short, they unfurl and retract like brushstrokes in motion, their peaks and ridges sharp as blades. Clouds and forests, dark and yellow, resemble written characters. Thus, the Heavenly Perfected Dao Lord, gazing down to observe their patterns, traced their contours and directions, following the rhythm of their forms to name the sacred mountains.\n\nIf you possess the form of the Eastern Marchmount, your spirit will be at peace and your life prolonged; your body will endure, and when you enter mountains or traverse rivers, the hundred mushrooms will gather of their own accord.\nIf you possess the form of the Southern Marchmount, the five afflictions will not touch you, and you will repel fiery calamities. Those who plot evil against you will suffer harm in return.\nIf you possess the form of the Central Marchmount, all your endeavors will prosper, bringing wealth in vast measure; every wish will be fulfilled without toil or exertion.\nIf you possess the form of the Western Marchmount, you will dispel the five weapons, remain unharmed by blades, and the numinous spirits of mountains and rivers will revere and welcome you.\nIf you possess the form of the Northern Marchmount, you will enter water without disaster, the hundred poisons will be subdued, and you will command dragons, enjoying blessings and emoluments for long ages.\n\nIf you possess all the forms of the Five Marchmounts, you will traverse heaven and earth, pervading the four directions; all who see you will rejoice, and humans and spirits will be as one.\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor mustered the feudal lords and battled Chiyou in the wilds of Zhuolu, capturing him. The lords all revered Xuanyuan as Son of Heaven, succeeding Shennong; this was the Yellow Emperor. When any in the realm rebelled, he would campaign against them, breaking through mountains to open roads, never resting in one place. He journeyed east to the sea, ascending Mount Tai and Daizong. Westward, he reached Kongtong, climbing Jitou. Southward, he came to the Jiang, ascending Xiongxiang. Northward, he pursued the Xunyu to Mount Fufu, establishing his capital at Zhuolu’s slopes. His migrations and travels knew no fixed abode.\n\nObserving that the four marchmounts each had assisting mountains while the Southern Marchmount stood solitary and unsupported, he memorialized the Three Heavens’ Supreme Dao Lord, petitioning that Mount Huo and Mount Qian be appointed as reserve lords. The petition was granted. The Emperor then personally crafted the mountains, inscribing their forms and appending them to the Five Charts. He honored Qingcheng as the Venerable Elder, designating Mount Lu as the Envoy. Their forms were arranged in sequence, beginning thus with the Yellow Emperor.\n\nThe Lord of Mount Tai, Eastern Marchmount, commands a host of 5,900 spirits and governs life and death, serving as the marshal of all ghosts. He is the ancestral master of blood sacrifices and temple rites. The vulgar world worships demonic shrines and wayward spirits, yet the dead all return to Mount Tai to receive judgment and punishment.\n\nThose who bear the forms of the Five Marchmounts and enter their mountains or journey to Mount Tai will be met at the border by the Lord of Mount Tai and the spirits of all mountains and rivers. The Lord of Mount Tai wears a cyan robe, a seven-tiered azure-green crown, and the seal of *Tongyang* and *Great Luminance*; he rides a green dragon, accompanied by his retinue to welcome you.\n\nThe Lord of Mount Heng, Southern Marchmount, commands 70,700 immortals. When you enter the Southern Marchmount, the spirits of its mountains and rivers will all come forth to welcome you. The Lord of Mount Heng wears a vermilion radiance robe, a nine-cinnabar solar essence crown, and the seal of *Night-Luminous Heavenly Perfection*; he rides a red dragon, accompanied by his retinue to welcome you.\n\nThe Lord of Mount Song, Central Marchmount, commands 30,000 jade maidens. When you enter the mountain, all the numinous spirits under the Central Marchmount’s jurisdiction will come to welcome you. The Lord of Mount Song wears a yellow silk robe, a yellow jade *Taiyi* crown, and the seal of *Divine Ancestor* and *Yang Harmony*; he rides a yellow dragon, accompanied by his retinue to welcome you. The Central Marchmount governs the five soils; you should revere it well. The Supreme Lord often appoints Perfected of the Three Heavens with virtue and renown to reside there.\n\nThe Lord of Mount Hua, Western Marchmount, commands 4,100 immortals and jade maidens. When Daoists enter the mountains under his jurisdiction, the spirits all come forth to welcome them. The Lord of Mount Hua wears a white silk robe, a nine-pendant *Great Simplicity* crown, and the seal of *Opening Heaven* and *Communing with the Perfected*; he rides a white dragon to welcome you.\n\nThe Lord of Mount Heng, Northern Marchmount, commands 7,000 immortals and jade maidens. When you enter the mountains and rivers under his jurisdiction, the spirits all come forth to welcome you. The Lord of Mount Heng wears a dark flowing robe, a *Great Obscurity Perfected Numinous* crown, and the seal of *Eternal Ford* and *Awakening to the Perfected*; he rides a black dragon to welcome you.\n\nThe Venerable Elder of Qingcheng was appointed by the Yellow Emperor and presides over earthbound immortals, serving as the overseer of the Five Marchmounts to govern all officials. The Elder commands 10,000 immortals; when Daoists enter his mountain, the Elder wears a vermilion radiance robe, a *Covering Heaven* crown, and the seal of the *Three Courts*; he rides a ceremonial chariot, accompanied by the host of spirits to welcome you.\n\nThe Envoy of Mount Lu, appointed by the Yellow Emperor, holds a rank equivalent to Imperial Censor and oversees the positions of all immortals, serving as the inspector of the Five Marchmounts. When Daoists enter his mountain, the Envoy wears a vermilion *chou* robe, a *Level Splendor* crown, and the seal of the *Three Heavens’ True Forms* to welcome you.\n\nThe Reserve Lord of Mount Huo, Southern Marchmount, was appointed by the Yellow Emperor as deputy to Mount Heng. He commands 30,000 spirits, regulating the harmonious *qi* above and succoring the common people below. He examines and registers all immortals, issues commands to the water spirits, and serves as the bureau of rigorous verification, obeyed by all spirits. When Daoists enter his domain, the Reserve Lord wears a green brocade robe, a *Dawn Illumination* crown, and the jade scepter of the Dao Lord to welcome you.\n\nAt times they ride chariots of graded rank, at others they mount dragons and tigers. The Reserve Lord of Mount Qian, appointed by the Yellow Emperor, serves as deputy to Mount Heng, occasionally participating in governance to assist in its affairs. When Daoists enter his mountain, the Reserve Lord wears a robe embroidered with purple radiance, a *Triple Numinosity* crown, and the seal of the Vermilion Office. He rides a chariot of crimson #1 to welcome you.\n\nThe various Assistant Lords of the Marchmounts all aid and support the Lords of the Peaks, partaking in governance. When Daoists enter their mountains, the Assistant Lords wear vermilion robes, *Immortal Splendor* crowns, and the insignia of the *Supreme True Forms*, coming to welcome you without fixed timing.\n\nDongfang Shuo said: The first section of the *True Forms of the Five Marchmounts* in ancient texts dates to the era before Shennong, when the script of the *Eight Assemblies of the Supreme* soared through the heavens—predating even the age of bird-track writing. Without translation and explication by immortals, its meaning remains forever obscure.\n\nWhenever a Daoist wishes to carry the charts for ascending the mountain’s likeness or completing a scroll of ancient script, they must inscribe this on the exterior before securing it, then wear the talisman. The proper time is the first month, when the *yin* branch is established. One must fast for seven days, and during the fast, transcribe the text in white. The offering ritual follows the method of transmission, though the invocations in the liturgy may be adjusted according to the individual.\n\nWhenever transcribing the text, one must burn incense to the left and right.\n\n**Ritual Text for Transmitting the Charts**\nI, born of flesh and blood, descendant of the hundred officials, have wallowed in clamor and evil, adrift in the turbid affairs of the world. By fortunate fate, I have encountered the great transformation, washing away my defiled ways to begin anew. I cultivate my heart and guard against transgression, aspiring to the numinous and true. Day and night I strive, never daring to rest.\n\nFormerly, on the [day] of [month] in the year [year], at [location], I received the *True Forms* of Master [A] and [B], in accordance with the *Ordinances of the Nine Capitals and Thousand Luminaries*, and was permitted to transmit them. Now, in accordance with the Daoist laws, I dutifully entrust these esoteric teachings.\n\nHere is a fellow Daoist, [name] of [prefecture], [county], [village], a man of [age] years, diligent and reverent, who will surely propagate the numinous transformation and spread the correct *qi* of the spirits. On this [day] of [month] in the present year, we have sworn a blood oath and transmitted the *True Charts* to him. We pledge with silk and make covenant, binding him never to disclose them. May we share a bond of heavenly kinship, ever protecting one another, never forsaking the fundamental for the trivial or seeking vainglory and profit. The general principles of the Five Eights determine the timing of fortune and misfortune; one must assess oneself and scrutinize others, then act accordingly.\n\nWith this solemn fast and offering, I present this petition, that it may ascend to the Three Heavens.\n—Transmitted by Master Zheng.\n\n**Ritual Text for Receiving the Charts**\nI, born of flesh and blood, descendant of withered bones, raised in a defiled age, have been stained by chaos and the transgressions of my ancestors. My past deeds have accumulated faults, and my misfortunes tower like hills. Heaven has opened my heart, allowing me to hear the sagely transformation. My mind awakens, and I reform my ways, delighting in life and loving the Dao. I yearn for numinous response and seek true resonance, hoping to be cleansed and purified, that my life may be prolonged. I constantly cast off the impure and follow the good, desiring to become one of the *seed people*. I strive for long life, awaiting heavenly inspiration. In climbing mountains and crossing rivers, I rely on numinous aid. I dedicate my heart to the gate of the Dao, never daring to waver. I offer local tribute to demonstrate my sincerity.\n\nToday, I receive the *True Forms of the Five Marchmounts*, which I will treasure and keep for myself, binding them to my fate from beginning to end. The Five Eights have their appointed time, and I shall never reveal them midway. In transmission, we are as kin, loving and protecting one another like shared *qi*, setting aside glory and disgrace. May the heavenly ordinances protect me. I dare not be negligent or violate the prohibitions, but will uphold the transmitted methods and seal them in my heart.\n\nWith this solemn fast and offering, I mark the beginning. May this petition ascend to the Three Heavens, presented to the Supreme, to expel my Three Corpses, inscribe my name in the Register of the Living, and engrave it on jade tablets, sealed in the Crimson Palace. May the numinous peaks of the five directions each dispatch their five spirits, and may the thousand mountains and hundred rivers send their attending officials to guard the charts and texts, protecting my body, that the scripture of long life may endure and my years extend for countless eons.\n\n**Ancient Original True Forms of the Five Marchmounts**\n**True Forms of the Five Marchmount Mountains**\n\nIf there are women or children in the household who delight in the Dao but are not yet ready for the full transmission, have them carry this text in a crimson pouch, worn on the head. It will repel all ghosts and demons, and evil spirits will not dare to approach. If even the introductory text worn on the head has such power, how much more so the great *True Forms* themselves?\n\nGe Hong said: It is also fitting to fast before wearing them.\n\n**The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao of the Three Heavens has decreed.**\n\n**Heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, hills and mounds—**\n**the gods protect my disciple, be vigilant.**\n**Harm and misfortune shall long be pacified;**\n**longevity shall endure.**\n\nThe **Three Heavens Supreme Lord’s Longevity Talisman**—when Daoist adepts wear it upon the head, they may traverse mountains, forests, rivers, and seas, journeying freely across the world. All spirits shall attend and guard them; none dare oppose this talisman. When fasting, offering, and wearing it, copy it in the same manner as the Five Marchmounts’ forms.\n\nIts name is the **Supreme Lord of the Dao’s Moving Script**. The celestial writing is beyond full comprehension; Dongfang Shuo revealed it. This is a method predating the age of bird-track script, not a text from the era of the Three Sovereigns. Those who wear it should keep it together with the Five Marchmounts’ forms.\n\nOnly when immortal beings inscribe the names of places in the mountains may they use Han characters—no other exceptions.\n\n**Eastern Spring**\n**True Form Chart of the Eastern Marchmount Mount Tai**\nTo the right: The form and source of the Eastern Marchmount Mount Tai, encompassing two thousand *li* in circumference, located within the Langye region.\n\n**Southern Summer**\n**True Form Chart of the Southern Marchmount Mount Heng**\nTo the right: The form and source of the Southern Marchmount Mount Heng, encompassing two thousand *li* in circumference, located within the Changsha region.\n\n**Central Earth (Wu-Ji Soil)**\n**True Form Chart of the Central Marchmount Mount Song**\nTo the right: The form and source of the Central Marchmount Mount Song, encompassing one thousand *li* in circumference, located within the Liyang region.\n\n**Western Autumn**\n**True Form Chart of the Western Marchmount Mount Hua**\nTo the right: The form and source of the Western Marchmount Mount Hua, extending four thousand *li* in circumference, its length spanning the Huayin region.\n\n**Northern Winter**\n**True Form Chart of the Northern Marchmount Mount Chang**\nTo the right: The form and source of the Northern Marchmount Mount Chang, encompassing three thousand *li* in circumference, located within the Changshan region.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor commanded the **Southern Treasurer of Mount Huo**—Mount Huo, also called Red City.\nTo the right: The form and source of Mount Huo, encompassing one thousand *li* in circumference, located within the Kuaiji region.\n\nThe **Southern Treasurer of Mount Qian**\nMount Qian\nTo the right: The form and source of Mount Qian, located north of Lujiang, encompassing three thousand three hundred *li* in circumference.\n\nThe **Elder of Mount Qingcheng**\nMount Qingcheng, also called Heavenly Kingdom Mountain\nTo the right: The form and source of Mount Qingcheng, located within the Shu Commandery, encompassing two thousand seven hundred *li* in circumference.\n\nThe **Attendant of Mount Lu**\nMount Lu\nTo the right: The form of Mount Lu, located south of Lujiang, encompassing one thousand one hundred *li* in circumference.\n\nBlack represents mountain forms; red, water sources; white, the mouths of caves and chambers. If drawn small, hills and mounds appear subtle; if drawn large, ridges and peaks stand majestic.\n\nGe Hong said: Height and depth follow the form; length and brevity capture its likeness. As for the depiction of divine herbs and stone chambers within the source, these were later added by generations of immortals who marked such places on the charts.\n\n**Ancient Original True Forms of the Five Marchmounts**\n**Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure True Forms of the Five Marchmounts**\n\n**True Form Writs of the Five Marchmounts**\nThe Three Heavens’ Supreme Lord of the Great Dao issues this decree:\nMay Heaven and Earth, mountains and rivers, hills and mounds,\nGuard my disciples—let harm and misfortune be long pacified,\nAnd life endure.\n\n**East—Spring**\nThe Lord of Mount Tai of the Eastern Marchmount commands a host of spirits, five thousand nine hundred and nine, within the bounds of Yanzhou, encompassing two thousand *li* in circumference.\n\n**South—Summer**\nThe Lord of Mount Heng of the Southern Marchmount commands immortal officials, seven thousand seven hundred, within the bounds of Changsha, encompassing two thousand *li* in circumference.\n\n**Center—Earth (Wu-Ji Soil)**\nMount Song of the Central Marchmount commands divine youths and immortal maidens, thirty thousand, within the bounds of Luoyang, encompassing one thousand *li* in circumference.\n\n**West—Autumn**\nThe Lord of Mount Hua of the Western Marchmount commands immortals and jade maidens, seven thousand, within the eastern bounds of Chang’an, encompassing four thousand *li* in circumference, long from south to north.\n\n**North—Winter**\nThe Lord of Mount Chang of the Northern Marchmount commands immortal youths and jade maidens, twenty thousand, within the bounds of Changshan, encompassing three thousand *li* in circumference.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor commanded:\n**Lord of the Southern Storehouse of Mount Huo**\nThe true form of Mount Huo lies within the bounds of Pingyang, encompassing one thousand seven hundred *li* in circumference.\n\n**Lord of the Southern Storehouse of Mount Qian**\nThe true form of Mount Qian lies within the northern bounds of Lujiang, encompassing three thousand three hundred *li* in circumference.\n\n**Elder of Mount Qingcheng**\nThe true form of Mount Qingcheng lies within the bounds of Shu Commandery, also named the Mountain of Heaven’s Realm, encompassing two thousand seven hundred *li* in circumference.\n\n**Attendant of Mount Lu**\nThe true form of Mount Lu lies within the southern bounds of Lujiang, encompassing one thousand two hundred *li* in circumference.\n\nBlack represents mountain forms; red, water sources; yellow dots mark the mouths of caverns. If drawn small, hills and mounds appear subtle; if drawn large, ridges and peaks stand majestic. Ge Hong said: Height and depth follow the form; length and brevity capture its likeness.\n\nThose who keep these charts in their homes shall be guarded by benevolent spirits; all malevolent ghosts, disasters, and illnesses shall dissipate of themselves. If a superior adept wears them, the myriad spirits shall come to pay homage.\n\nMountain veins and spring pulses flow upward and downward. Long ago, the Queen Mother of the West transmitted to Emperor Wu of Han the original scripture of over ten thousand words, inscribed upon these charts. Today, it is divided into five sections, with transmission restrictions—its regulations are strict and may not be casually passed on.\n\nThe preceding seven writs are the **Longevity Talismans of the Supreme Lord of the Dao of the Three Heavens**. If a superior adept wears them upon the head and enters mountains, forests, rivers, or seas, they may traverse the world unobstructed, with all spirits attending in protection. Also named the **Celestial Writ of the Supreme Lord of the Dao’s Decree**.\n\nThe celestial script cannot be fully comprehended; Dongfang Shuo revealed it. These are the **Divination Texts from Before the Age of Bird Tracks**, not the writings of the Three Sovereigns’ era. Those who wear them should store them together with the true forms of the Five Marchmounts. Later immortals have inscribed the names of mountain herbs in fine script—these are not to be worn.\n\nProclaimed on the day of the year of the *Tai Sui*, the month of ___, the day of ___.\n**Guarantor and Preceptor**\n\n**Supervising Initiation Master**\n**Initiation Masters in Full Assembly**\n\n*Here ends the* **Ancient Original True Forms of the Five Marchmounts** *of the* **Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure** *#1 The character* 「赤」 *was originally missing and has been supplied according to the* **Preface and Discourse on the True Forms of the Five Marchmounts**. *#2* 「咎」*: Originally mistakenly written as* 「然」*, corrected according to the* **Preface and Discourse on the True Forms of the Five Marchmounts**. *#3 The character* 「相」 *was originally missing and has been supplied according to the* **Preface and Discourse on the True Forms of the Five Marchmounts**.*",

      "translated_text": "At times they ride chariots of graded rank, at others they mount dragons and tigers. The Reserve Lord of Mount Qian, appointed by the Yellow Emperor, serves as deputy to Mount Heng, occasionally participating in governance to assist in its affairs. When Daoists enter his mountain, the Reserve Lord wears a robe embroidered with purple radiance, a *Triple Numinosity* crown, and the seal of the Vermilion Office. He rides a chariot of crimson #1 to welcome you.\n\nThe various Assistant Lords of the Marchmounts all aid and support the Lords of the Peaks, partaking in governance. When Daoists enter their mountains, the Assistant Lords wear vermilion robes, *Immortal Splendor* crowns, and the insignia of the *Supreme True Forms*, coming to welcome you without fixed timing.\n\nDongfang Shuo said: The first section of the *True Forms of the Five Marchmounts* in ancient texts dates to the era before Shennong, when the script of the *Eight Assemblies of the Supreme* soared through the heavens—predating even the age of bird-track writing. Without translation and explication by immortals, its meaning remains forever obscure.\n\nWhenever a Daoist wishes to carry the charts for ascending the mountain’s likeness or completing a scroll of ancient script, they must inscribe this on the exterior before securing it, then wear the talisman. The proper time is the first month, when the *yin* branch is established. One must fast for seven days, and during the fast, transcribe the text in white. The offering ritual follows the method of transmission, though the invocations in the liturgy may be adjusted according to the individual.\n\nWhenever transcribing the text, one must burn incense to the left and right.\n\n**Ritual Text for Transmitting the Charts**\nI, born of flesh and blood, descendant of the hundred officials, have wallowed in clamor and evil, adrift in the turbid affairs of the world. By fortunate fate, I have encountered the great transformation, washing away my defiled ways to begin anew. I cultivate my heart and guard against transgression, aspiring to the numinous and true. Day and night I strive, never daring to rest.\n\nFormerly, on the [day] of [month] in the year [year], at [location], I received the *True Forms* of Master [A] and [B], in accordance with the *Ordinances of the Nine Capitals and Thousand Luminaries*, and was permitted to transmit them. Now, in accordance with the Daoist laws, I dutifully entrust these esoteric teachings.\n\nHere is a fellow Daoist, [name] of [prefecture], [county], [village], a man of [age] years, diligent and reverent, who will surely propagate the numinous transformation and spread the correct *qi* of the spirits. On this [day] of [month] in the present year, we have sworn a blood oath and transmitted the *True Charts* to him. We pledge with silk and make covenant, binding him never to disclose them. May we share a bond of heavenly kinship, ever protecting one another, never forsaking the fundamental for the trivial or seeking vainglory and profit. The general principles of the Five Eights determine the timing of fortune and misfortune; one must assess oneself and scrutinize others, then act accordingly.\n\nWith this solemn fast and offering, I present this petition, that it may ascend to the Three Heavens.\n—Transmitted by Master Zheng.\n\n**Ritual Text for Receiving the Charts**\nI, born of flesh and blood, descendant of withered bones, raised in a defiled age, have been stained by chaos and the transgressions of my ancestors. My past deeds have accumulated faults, and my misfortunes tower like hills. Heaven has opened my heart, allowing me to hear the sagely transformation. My mind awakens, and I reform my ways, delighting in life and loving the Dao. I yearn for numinous response and seek true resonance, hoping to be cleansed and purified, that my life may be prolonged. I constantly cast off the impure and follow the good, desiring to become one of the *seed people*. I strive for long life, awaiting heavenly inspiration. In climbing mountains and crossing rivers, I rely on numinous aid. I dedicate my heart to the gate of the Dao, never daring to waver. I offer local tribute to demonstrate my sincerity.\n\nToday, I receive the *True Forms of the Five Marchmounts*, which I will treasure and keep for myself, binding them to my fate from beginning to end. The Five Eights have their appointed time, and I shall never reveal them midway. In transmission, we are as kin, loving and protecting one another like shared *qi*, setting aside glory and disgrace. May the heavenly ordinances protect me. I dare not be negligent or violate the prohibitions, but will uphold the transmitted methods and seal them in my heart.\n\nWith this solemn fast and offering, I mark the beginning. May this petition ascend to the Three Heavens, presented to the Supreme, to expel my Three Corpses, inscribe my name in the Register of the Living, and engrave it on jade tablets, sealed in the Crimson Palace. May the numinous peaks of the five directions each dispatch their five spirits, and may the thousand mountains and hundred rivers send their attending officials to guard the charts and texts, protecting my body, that the scripture of long life may endure and my years extend for countless eons.\n\n**Ancient Original True Forms of the Five Marchmounts**\n**True Forms of the Five Marchmount Mountains**\n\nIf there are women or children in the household who delight in the Dao but are not yet ready for the full transmission, have them carry this text in a crimson pouch, worn on the head. It will repel all ghosts and demons, and evil spirits will not dare to approach. If even the introductory text worn on the head has such power, how much more so the great *True Forms* themselves?\n\nGe Hong said: It is also fitting to fast before wearing them.\n\n**The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao of the Three Heavens has decreed.**",
