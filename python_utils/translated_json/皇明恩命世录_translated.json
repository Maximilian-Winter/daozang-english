Ming upon the Twenty Generations of Heavenly Masters of Mount Longhu**\n\n**First Generation: Zhang Daoling**\nHe dispelled wind and lightning’s blight,\nHis mind governed the ten thousand spirits.\nInnate was his divine wisdom,\nTurning turbid to clear.\nThe Dao, never concealed,\nFilled his breast with immortal scriptures.\nDeer galloped, tigers bore him,\nSwiftly he ascended on high.\n\n**Second Generation: Zhang Heng**\nHis steps trod the flying void,\nUtmost subtlety his pivot.\nHolding the talisman, he decreed,\nHis divine chariot drawn by rams.\nHe circled the Jade Capital,\nA myriad leagues in an instant.\nKan and Li conjoined,\nA fish leapt from the abyss.\n\n**Third Generation: Zhang Lu**\nHe bore and expounded,\nPine-shaded furnace smoke.\nPeach blossoms in the grotto,\nThree thousand laden branches.\nWhite cranes soared aloft,\nDeer slumbered beneath the crags.\nJade girdles chimed in the nine skies,\nFire-dates ripened year upon year.\n\n**Fourth Generation: Zhang Sheng**\nHe inherited the talisman, inherited the scriptures,\nHis ascent reached the celestial court.\nForever he propagated this teaching,\nTurning the Dipper, shifting the stars.\nAt dawn he roamed the Northern Sea,\nAt dusk, verdant pines welcomed him.\nThe will of the founding master,\nWas borne upon a deer-drawn carriage.\n\n**Fifth Generation: Zhang Zhaocheng**\nSleeve-sheathed sword he hastened,\nIts radiance shot toward the Dipper’s tomb.\nThe ten thousand spirits all hearkened,\nHis divine tread upon heaven’s thoroughfare.\nHe slew demons, bound evil,\nPeerless beside his master.\nHe warded off calamity, repelled misfortune,\nQi exhaled and spread.\n\n**Sixth Generation: Zhang Jiao**\nLead and mercury formed cinnabar,\nMist wove into purple clouds.\nWithin the grotto, heaven and earth,\nPeach blossoms in vernal splendor.\nHe taught not the unworthy,\nNor boasted of himself.\nWithin the gourd, sun and moon—\nWhat more could be added?\n\n**Seventh Generation: Zhang Hui**\nHe stroked the azure pine, the deer,\nFeathered fan in hand, he scaled the peak.\nThe Dao harmonized with non-action,\nHe inherited his master’s seal.\nNot good, yet good,\nHis divine merit was profound.\nKnowing the constant, he guarded silence,\nDelighting in the Dao, he moved with ease.\n\n**Eighth Generation: Zhang Jiong**\nHe scorned the vulgar,\nLoving to dwell in thatched huts.\nA pair of white cranes,\nStill he rode the *zhi*-deer.\nBeneath the moon, stars hastened,\nTurning yellow to green.\nThe Dao’s qi ever abided,\nYear after year he fasted from grain.\n\n**Ninth Generation: Zhang Fu**\nDrunk, he slumbered beneath the pine,\nWhite clouds enveloped his robes.\nSeeming inebriated, yet sober,\nHe commanded the hidden and subtle.\nUtmost divinity was his design,\nCranes soared, swords flew.\nHosts of demons withdrew,\nGreat monsters were all subdued.\n\n**Tenth Generation: Zhang Zixiang**\nPeach blossoms just unfurled,\nSpring pines in verdant haze.\nReclining high in white clouds,\nHis robe was woven of celestial maw.\nWith a shout, he summoned springs,\nCommanding swords to soar as spirits flew.\nSupreme and utmost Perfected,\nHis wonders could not be surpassed.\n\n**Eleventh Generation: Zhang Tongxuan**\nHe performed the yellow millet’s illusion,\nMastering Zhongli’s art.\nDriving clouds to follow,\nHe summoned thunder and lightning to fly.\nTen thousand valleys echoed with pine winds,\nCinnabar radiance lit the night.\nHis crane-feather cloak billowed,\nAt home amidst mist and rosy clouds.\n\n**Twelfth Generation: Zhang Heng**\nHis virtue and power matched his name,\nWhipping thunder, spurring the storm.\nGrasping his sword, eyes closed in meditation,\nNo demonic qi dared arise.\nHis spirit roamed the eight directions,\nAscending to the Celestial Capital.\nHow fitting his karmic bonds,\nEver luminous beyond the mundane.\n\n**Thirteenth Generation: Zhang Guang**\nNinefold refined numinous lead,\nCinnabar and mercury led the way.\nWhere his thatched hut flew,\nDemons and specters hung inverted.\nEyes blazing in the divine pivot,\nHe gazed down to Yellow Springs.\nLooking up to the Three Realms,\nHis vast qi billowed like mist.\n\n**Fourteenth Generation: Zhang Cizheng**\nAt dawn, he descended from lofty peaks,\nAt dusk, he entered the dust of the marketplace.\nThough he drank deeply, he never grew drunk,\nReturning at twilight in purple haze.\n\nMountain clouds sweep the pines, grottoes sealed for a thousand years.\nBlending radiance with the dust—mysterious, ever more profound.\n\n**Fifteenth Generation: Zhang Gao**\nMaster of the Lacquer Garden, illustrious in the State of Sophora.\nIn this illusory transformation, his legacy endures through ages.\nOnly by refining the self can one attain the immortal realm.\nEmpty yet luminous, unobscured—his Dao-qi ever whole.\n\n**Sixteenth Generation: Zhang Yingshao**\nSixteenth in succession, all practiced grain avoidance.\nDaily they consumed yellow essence, their bearing unlike the vulgar.\nThrough the passage of years, cycles repeated endlessly.\nWest wind on the ox’s back, a lone tune amid the blue mountains.\n\n**Seventeenth Generation: Zhang Yi**\nPreserved in peril, transcended in adversity.\nThus one knows the immortal, thus one knows the sage.\nSeventeenth in the lineage, his Dao-qi soared above mist.\nWho calls it madness? Who speaks of karmic bonds?\n\n**Eighteenth Generation: Zhang Shiyuan**\nFlying talismans proved efficacious, the founding ancestor’s teachings transmitted.\nIn this age, his name resounded across the eight wilds.\nCinnabar’s glow ascended, the Dipper’s qi grew ever brighter.\nHis spirit lingered, ever abiding in the Three Heavens.\n\n**Nineteenth Generation: Zhang Xiu**\nMist-light veiled the mountains, cinnabar qi intermingled.\nFlying talismans summoned ghosts—none dared disobey.\nWho calls it numinous? Who calls it mysterious?\nHe doffed his cap and robes, delighting in the Dao’s ease.\n\n**Twentieth Generation: Zhang Chen**\nCrowned by peaks, clad in clouds, his Dao-qi ever pure.\nFragrant seeds held their essence, the cauldron’s depths remained pristine.\nUpon the board, moves numbered—black and white stars in flight.\nSupremely subtle and wondrous, the cinnabar field thick with Earth’s power.\n\n*End of Scroll One of The Imperial Ming’s Decrees and Records of Eminent Worthies*\n\n*Scroll Two of The Imperial Ming’s Decrees and Records of Eminent Worthies*\n\n**The Forty-Second Celestial Master, Great Perfected Zhang Zhengchang**\n**Proclamation of Recruitment**\n\nBy decree of the Prince of Wu, issued through the Branch Secretariat of Jiangxi and other regions:\nWe have heard that the Mysterious Teachings, in their non-action, silently aid the governance of the state; as the imperial enterprise flourishes, the winds of virtue and power are greatly exalted.\nThus do We regard this Perfected One, who has long dwelled in blessed lands. Now that he has been entered into the imperial registers, We must specially honor his person and bearing.\nThe Celestial Master, Great Perfected, and Orthodox Unity Teachings’ Master of Longhu Mountain in Xinzhou—he who extends the noble lineage of the Marquis of Liu, who transmits the true teachings of Laozi—has received the ancestral master’s charge, commanding the hundred spirits; his heart roams with the Creator, transcending the ten thousand kinds.\nAll beings endowed with awareness turn toward him in reverence.\n\nIn the wake of warfare, however, the public courts have seen many disruptions. Recently, we have heard that the regalia of office have been laid aside, and the Master’s presence has been far removed to rivers and lakes. Thus, in our earnest search, we hope for his swift return to his rightful residence. Now that the provincial and prefectural authorities have been appointed, an official shall be dispatched bearing incense to the ancestral altar of Longhu Mountain, there to reverently honor the Perfected Immortal and offer prayers for the prolongation of the Emperor’s sacred life.\n\nThis proclamation shall be publicly issued to inform all. The military commanders and civil officials are hereby enjoined to seek out the Celestial Master with all due diligence, extending every courtesy to invite him back to the mountain, that he may resume his former role as overseer of the Daoist teachings. All who belong to the temples, halls, and monasteries of Longhu Mountain—along with their ritual implements and sacred vessels—must not be desecrated or damaged, nor may the divine spirits be profaned. The former holdings of mountain gardens, fields, and dwellings shall remain under the Master’s authority, and no military or civilian personnel may seize or occupy them. Violators shall be punished.\n\nThis proclamation is hereby issued.\nGiven on the ___ day of the ___ month, in the sixth year of the Longfeng era.\n\n---\n\nIn the fourth month of this year, [the Emperor] wrote *Stilling the Mind and Stabilizing the Nature to Concentrate Daoist Cultivation*, addressed to the Master of the Mysterious Altar, the Forty-Second Celestial Master, Perfected Zhang. On the sixth day of the fifth month, Perfected Yu arrived, bearing the imperial letter along with offerings of rare incense and plain silk, the sincerity of which was profound—sufficient to attest to the splendor of this sacred mountain’s cultural legacy.\n\nWe have heard that the Han Ancestral Celestial Master embodied virtue and power, his every movement aided by spirits. With but a single exhalation or inhalation, the heavens would darken, and the gods of thunder and lightning would all receive his command. Thus did he assist the state and succor the people, dispelling malevolent forces and averting floods and droughts. For this reason, his numinous renown has grown ever more illustrious through more than forty generations.\n\nNow that Our Master has ascended to his ancestral position, he must carry forward his forebear’s achievements—achievements that no other arts can equal. We hope that the Master will still his mind and stabilize his nature to concentrate his Daoist cultivation, thereby amplifying the traces of his predecessors’ numinous efficacy. In this way, the mountain of Longhu shall rise ever higher in esteem, and the people’s reverence shall deepen.\n\nIn this summer season, We trust that your Daoist constitution remains in peace. May you cherish yourself a thousandfold, ten thousandfold.\n\nIn the year *yisi*, [the Emperor] summoned [the Celestial Master] to an audience, commanded him to be seated, and bestowed a banquet upon him.\n\n---\n\n**Decree of Praise for the Celestial Master**\nBy the command of the Prince of Wu:\nAmidst heaven and earth, the myriad beings are not equal, and their lives are boundless—yet none is more spiritually endowed than humankind. However, the birth of sages and worthies is extraordinary, for they are descended from the most refined *qi* of heaven and earth. This is the common lot of the wise and sagely across the ages. Some are granted exceptional abilities by heaven, as if heaven itself bestows them upon humanity. Thus do they become emperors or kings, generals or ministers. In the case of Buddhism and Daoism, they become buddhas or immortals. Though they may be born of heaven and earth’s purest *qi*, their distinctions arise from heaven’s conferral of ability, and so their ranks differ.\n\nWe have heard that the Han Ancestral Celestial Master was born extraordinary: his brows towered, his beard bristled, and his eyes flashed like shooting stars or lightning, his divine majesty a thousandfold greater [than ordinary men]. Beginning in western Shu, he journeyed to Longhu Mountain, where he commanded spirits and established the Mysterious Altar. Yet his abilities were not merely for his own cultivation; they truly benefited the state and its people. From that time onward, he warded off great calamities, averted disasters, and illuminated the spirits of the three realms. His lineage has been passed down through successive generations, each of which has honored him. Why? Because the Celestial Master’s numinous efficacy brings benefit.\n\nSince We emerged from obscurity, the realm has undergone upheaval, and We have been revered by the multitudes. We dare not but exert Our utmost sincerity to pacify the people. Whenever We hear of the Celestial Master, We long to meet him. How joyous it is to behold him at last! His eyes flash like lightning, and his dignified bearing is that of a master of the dharma. Though he does not serve in an official capacity at court, to share this era with him is a once-in-a-millennium encounter—how could it not be wondrous?\n\nYet the mysteries of Buddhism and Daoism run deep, and they hold profound meaning. The foolish do not comprehend them, while those who do must not stray. To honor them brings blessings; to transgress brings misfortune. Thus do fortune and ruin wax and wane.\n\nDelighted by the Celestial Master’s dharma-bearing countenance, which resembles that of his ancestors, We hereby bestow these gifts.\n\n[The Emperor] summoned him again for an audience, bestowed a banquet and gifts of gold and silk, and permitted him to return to the mountain.\n\nIn the year *bingwu*, [the Emperor] issued a decree commanding the widespread distribution of talismanic water.\n\nThe August Decree of the Illustrious King states: We have heard that the Han Celestial Master wields wondrous mastery of the profound mechanism, penetrating Heaven and Earth, aiding all beings and benefiting the people, defending the state from calamities and warding off disasters. The prayers of sages through the ages have never failed to evoke response.\n\nNow that the Celestial Master resides at Chaotian Palace, scholars and commoners throng to seek talismans. The Master should carefully consider the distribution of talismans, verifying whether the supplicants face hardship or misfortune—or whether they are those without affliction. If a talisman is granted and later calamity suddenly arises, the ignorant masses, knowing no better, will claim the talisman’s efficacy was proven, or some may disparage it, spreading rumors among themselves. This is a concern for the Master.\n\nWould it not be better to grant talismans only to those with afflictions and withhold them from those without? Yet We are uncertain whether this approach is proper. It would be fitting to convene with the various dharma masters to deliberate, then widely distribute talismanic water, thereby concealing its wondrous workings and honoring the numinous spirit of the mountain.\n\nWe have heard that those afflicted by pestilence who drank from the well’s talismanic water recovered, and Our sagely mind rejoices in this. We command that a pavilion be erected over the well, to be named Taiyi Spring. We further command the presentation of the *Supreme Prolongation of Felicity Record*, and upon reviewing the petition, permit the Master to return to the mountain.\n\nBy special decree, the Ministry of Rites shall issue travel documents for his journey, facilitating his audience at court.\n\nOn the eighth day of the second month in the Dingwei year of the Haonian era, a decree was issued to select a master of refined Daoist arts to present a missive at court. The King of Hao penned a letter to the Master of the Mysterious Altar, Celestial Master Zhang of Mount Longhu.\n\nRecently, since the first month, We have been preoccupied with matters of state, yet what weighs upon Our heart is the desire to memorialize the Supreme Emperor. However, with no one to bear the petition to the Celestial Court, We have dispatched an envoy to the Celestial Master’s gate. We trust that, by the numinous power of your ancestors, you will surely act with utmost sincerity, sending a master well-versed in the wondrous arts of the Dao to bear the petition to Heaven, thereby expressing Our prayers. This would indeed reflect your reverent intent. Upon receipt of this letter, We hope you will promptly send forth a capable master. No further elaboration is needed.\n\nIn the fifth month of the first year of the Hongwu era, upon ascending the imperial throne, the Emperor held a banquet in the side hall. Turning to address the assembly, the Emperor proclaimed: “We hereby bestow upon you the title of Grand Perfected. The Ministry of Rites shall deliberate and grant you an official stipend.” The Celestial Master then respectfully declined the salary, requesting instead to continue issuing talismans and registers as before. In recognition of this, the Emperor exempted all households under his jurisdiction, as well as the various corvée services of the Great Shangqing Palace, establishing this as a permanent precedent. A silver seal was conferred, ranking him equivalent to a principal second-grade official, with the appointment of assistant instructors, scribes, and administrative aides.\n\n**Imperial Edict Conferring the Title of Grand Perfected upon the Forty-Second Generation Celestial Master**\n\nBy the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:\n\nWe reflect upon the true essence of the Mysterious Teachings, which expounds the canon of over five thousand words. The ancestral sanctuary has accumulated blessings, transmitting its lineage through forty-two generations. The land’s numen has nurtured the dragon-tiger’s elite, and the immortal’s bones have been refined into the semblance of crane and phoenix. You preside over the Orthodox Unity teachings, aiding Our Great Ming.\n\nCelestial Master Zhang Zhengchang, of simple and upright nature, embodies steadfast integrity. Heaven has endowed him with the sacred scriptures and precious talismans. He delves into the profound mysteries amid the pearls and grains, riding jade palanquins and jasper wheels to transcend the void and soar above the clouds. With sword in hand, ghosts and spirits obey his commands; ascending the altar, thunder and rain respond to his call. Truly, he is a master of both Heaven and humanity, a scion of divine luminosity.\n\nYet virtue is not constrained by titles and ranks, and temperament prizes the cultivation of harmony. In recent times, the conferral of eminent official positions, though seemingly honorable, does not align with the highest principles. Thus, We bestow the noble title of Grand Perfected, elevating him above all Daoist adepts of the age, his name resounding across the realm as the master of the ancestral altar.\n\nWe seek to convey Our sincerity to the Nine Heavens, and you shall employ your spiritual power to fulfill this. We aim to govern the Four Seas, and you shall aid this with your purity and tranquility. May you abundantly receive the primal qi, eternally securing blessings and prosperity.\n\nLet it be decreed: Zhang Zhengchang, Master of Orthodox Unity, Forty-Second Generation Celestial Master, Protector of the State, Propagator of the Ancestral Teachings, Communicator of Sincerity, Venerator of the Dao, and Magnifier of Virtue, Grand Perfected in Charge of Daoist Affairs, is hereby invested with this title.\n\nSo ordered.\n\nOn the first day of the third month in the first year of Hongwu, the Imperial Seal was affixed. The Emperor, retiring to the Hall of Reverent Self-Cultivation, addressed him with ease: \"Your ancestor, the Celestial Master, rendered meritorious service to the state, and thus your lineage has been transmitted alongside that of Confucius, enduring to this day. You should embody the principles of purity, tranquility, and non-action to assist in Our governance of utmost order, and We shall bestow Our favor upon you.\" Upon concluding the edict, he presented fifteen *yi* of silver to fund repairs for the Celestial Master’s residence.\n\nIn the second month of the second year, the Celestial Master was specially summoned to court. The Emperor, seated in the Hall of Heavenly Favor, granted him an audience and had accommodations prepared in advance. That month, he was summoned for consultation four times. On the thirteenth day of the second month, as the Emperor prepared to convey sincerity to the Heavenly Emperor, he observed a three-day fast. Clad in imperial robes and crown, he personally inscribed his name upon the ritual document. The Court of Imperial Sacrifices arranged the music, and he handed the document to the Celestial Master to recite and burn. Upon completion of the rites, he bestowed gold and silk, hosted a banquet at the Hall of Literary Glory, and provided a separate feast for his disciples at another pavilion, with rewards distributed according to rank.\n\nIn the sixth month of the third year, the Emperor, recognizing his merits and bestowing favor, specially instructed the Ministry of Rites to posthumously confer upon Zhengchang’s father, the Thirty-Ninth Generation Celestial Master, the title *Grand Perfected of Great Mystery, Assistant to Transformation, Embodying Benevolence, Responding to the Dao*. His successor was invested as *Master of Orthodox Unity, Grand Perfected of Great Mystery, Propagator of Transformation, Clarifier of Sincerity, Venerator of the Dao*. Zhengchang’s mother, the Immortal Lady Hu, formerly *Minghui Cishun*, was re-enfeoffed as *Reverent, Compassionate, Kind, Serene, and Mysterious Lady*.\n\nOne day, the Emperor summoned him for an audience and inquired about the nature of spirits and deities, then ordered the issuance of a silver seal for overseeing all Daoist affairs throughout the realm. In the fifth year, he further conferred the edict *Perpetually Entrusted with Daoist Affairs*.\n\nBy the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:\n\nWe reflect that the Daoist tradition, rooted in purity, stillness, and non-action, has endured since ancient times. The Zhang lineage of Mount Longhu has maintained its ancestral transmission without interruption since the Han dynasty. Its forty-second generation descendant, Zhengchang, embodies a mind of profound tranquility and preserves virtue in its purest harmony. Faithfully upholding the Orthodox Unity tradition, he has carried forward the ancestral teachings. We commend his merit and deem it fitting to bestow upon him the title of *Perfected*. Let him further invigorate the mystic winds of the Dao and perpetually oversee its teachings.\n\nThus, he is hereby invested as *Successor of Orthodox Unity, Protector of the Realm, Expounder of the Ancestral Teachings, Communicator of Sincerity, Venerator of the Dao, and Grand Perfected of Great Virtue*, with authority over all Daoist affairs throughout the realm. Let Zhang Zhengchang act in accordance with this decree.\n\n*Edict*\nSeal of the fifth year of Hongwu, twelfth month\n\nIn the ninth year, the Emperor dispatched an envoy to summon him, but Zhengchang arrived ahead of schedule for an audience. The Emperor rejoiced, saying, “Your coming aligns perfectly with Our intent.” The following autumn, We shall send envoys to offer sacrifices to the gods of the seas and mountains. You shall select refined practitioners of pure cultivation to accompany them.\n\nA banquet was granted, along with gifts of a gold-threaded ritual robe, a jade gui tablet and pendant, and ritual implements.\n\nIn the tenth year, he was commanded to lead his disciples to the capital, where the Emperor summoned him for an audience.\n\nAt the Wumen Gate tower, a banquet was bestowed. The Emperor raised his goblet and said, “You should drain this cup.” He then commanded the eunuch attendants to present an imperial composition, *Eulogies on the Heavenly Masters Through the Ages*, saying, “One day, I shall inscribe this and grant it to you.” The following day, an imperial edict was issued for Zhengchang to accompany the Grand Preceptor, Duke of Han, Li Shanchang, in offering sacrifices at Mount Song. Other high ministers were dispatched with his disciples to perform rites at the sacred peaks and altars. Robes in two sets were conferred, along with varying amounts of silk and coin.\n\nUpon their return, another banquet was granted, with rewards as before.\n\n*Edict for the Sacrificial Mission to Mount Song*\nWe decree unto Zhang Zhengchang, the Great Perfected One who Inherits and Propagates the Orthodox Unity Teachings:\n\nWe have heard that Heaven brings forth the people and establishes a ruler, and the ruler, for the people, establishes the Mandate. Thus, the reverent worship of the hundred spirits is the foremost duty of the state. When We and you contended amidst the strife of rival warlords, our victories in battle and conquest could not have been achieved without the favor of the Supreme August One and the Earth God, nor without the efficacious numen of the sacred peaks and sea marshes. Now, as the new autumn approaches, the rites for the sacred peaks and sea marshes must be performed to offer thanks and repayment.\n\nIn ancient times, the sovereign would personally journey to the four quarters to perform sacrifices at the altars. Yet We, having newly established the foundations of the state, find the people’s livelihood only just begun, and thus cannot attend in person. We therefore specially command you to act as Our proxy, presenting sacrificial animals, libations, and silk offerings at the abodes of the gods.\n\nHence this decree is issued for your compliance. Hold it in reverence. By Our Mandate.\n\nThe Eleventh Day of the Sixth Month, Hongwu Reign Year 10 [Seal]\n\nIn the eleventh year, the Ministry of Rites, led by Minister Zhang Chou, presented the report of a passing. Upon hearing the news, the Emperor sighed in sorrow for a long while, saying: \"I had intended to command the establishment of separate shrines for the Five Peaks, but he had only just reached Mount Song when his allotted span came to this end.\" Thereupon, the Emperor personally composed a eulogy and issued a decree dispatching An Qing, former Vice Minister of the Zhejiang Branch Secretariat, to the mountain to convey the imperial sacrifice.\n\nIn the eleventh year of the Hongwu reign, the year *wuwu*, on the twentieth day of the first month, *guisi* (the first day being *jiayin*), the Emperor dispatched An Qing, Vice Minister of Zhejiang, to offer sacrifices to the spirit of the Great Perfected Zhang Zhengchang, saying:\n\nSuccessor to the world-transcending Dharma,\nUnifier of the immortals and savior of humanity,\nWarder against calamity and defender from harm,\nMaster of the mechanisms that turn the myriad spirits—\nWith flying talismans and sword in hand,\nYou shifted constellations and moved stars.\nThe thunder gods heeded your commands,\nWhile demons and specters hid their forms.\nThe radiance of the Dao shone forth,\nYour countenance upright, your essence refined.\nWhy did your phoenix-borne departure come so swiftly,\nTaking the Dharma Seal to the Supreme Clarity?\nNow We send one to offer sacrifices of animals and wine—\nIf you possess awareness, partake in this offering.\n\n*Huangming Enming Shilu*, Scroll Two (End)\n\n[Note 1: Originally written as *fa* (伐), amended to *dai* (代) based on context.]\n[Note 2: The character *lai* (莱) is unclear in the original; the reading is conjectural.]\n\n*Huangming Enming Shilu*, Scroll Three\nThe Forty-Third Generation Great Perfected, Zhang Yuchu\n\nIn the thirteenth year of Hongwu, an imperial edict was conferred upon the Great Perfected:\n\nBy the Mandate of Heaven and the Grace of the Emperor, We decree:\n\nWe have heard that the rulers of high antiquity governed the realm by dividing the people into four classes—scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants. Yet from the Han dynasty to the present, the people have been guided by six, with the addition of the Buddhist and Daoist traditions.\n\nThe Dao has flourished because of your ancestor, Yuchu, who communed with spirits and mastered transformations, ascending in wondrous flight into the Great Void. He braved the boundless winds of the vast expanse and inhaled the vast qi of the cosmos. Through this, he brought benefit to the multitudes, and his merits were recorded through the ages. Thus, the Dharma has been transmitted for generations, and the lamp of incense has burned without end. This is because his vows were profound, his virtue spread above and below, and his spirit grew ever more efficacious.\n\nNow that the former Perfected has departed, you □ shall succeed in this generation. We specially dispatch an envoy to your residence to appoint you as the Great Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, Successor to the Teachings, Unifier of the Dao, Expounder of Non-Action, Illuminator of Ancestral Glory, and Administrator of Daoist Affairs. Conduct yourself with reverence and care. By Our decree.\n\n*Edict*\nThe twenty-eighth day of the second month, the thirteenth year of Hongwu.\n\nBy Imperial Edict, the Emperor decrees:\n\nFormer Perfected Zhang Zhengchang’s heir, Yu Chu, once renowned throughout the realm—from the Han dynasty to the present—has remained unforgotten. This is because his mastery in averting disasters and warding off calamities brought merit to the throne and benefit to the people; thus, his legacy endures.\n\nWe have learned that upon completing your mourning rites, you shall assume the foremost position within the Orthodox Teachings, leading disciples in cultivation. When the talisman arrives, We shall issue further instructions. Remain steadfast in resolve, and harmony between above and below shall be achieved. Hence this edict.\n\n*Edict*\n*Command*\nThe twenty-eighth day of the second month, the thirteenth year of Hongwu.\n\n*Seal*\n\nBy Imperial Edict, to encourage cultivation and align with the numinous:\n\nTo the Great Perfected Zhang Yu Chu, Successor to the Teachings of Orthodox Unity:\n\nThe secret formulas and profound mysteries must be transmitted without cease. When you wield the true essence of the Primordial Origin and command the myriad spirits as if by echo and shadow, then in the moment of application, the divine shall respond to the efficacy of talismans and formulas—such is the Way of unbroken transmission.\n\nHow swiftly shall the resonance be! Yet if this is not so, even if one masters secret texts and refines finger seals to perfection, even with ten thousand repetitions, what response could there be?\n\nMoreover, from your ancestors to the present, those who have succeeded through the generations have done so by their power to avert disasters and ward off calamities. You are still young; you must cultivate with discipline, purify your essence and spirit, and seek communion with the divine. When the time comes for application, the spirits shall surely answer your call. Hence this edict.\n\nThe fourteenth year.\n\n**Edict Conferring the Title of Mysterious Lady upon Madam Bao**\n\nBy the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:\n\nAmong ministers who hold rank and office, wives derive honor from their husbands, and mothers rise in esteem through their sons—such has been the virtuous precedent from ancient times to the present.\n\nYou, Madam Bao, mother of Zhang Yuchu, the Orthodox Unity Successor and Perfected Master, have given birth to a worthy son who has worthily carried forth the Mysterious Tradition. By special decree, you are hereby enfeoffed as the **Mysterious Lady of Pure Emptiness, Primal Simplicity, and Wondrous Virtue**.\n\nLet you ever hold this in reverence, and thus uphold the grace of this imperial mandate.\n\n**Decree and Edict**\n*Twenty-first day of the first lunar month, the fourteenth year of Hongwu*\n\n*Sixteenth year:* Summoned to the capital; commanded to preside over the **Great Jade Register Ritual** at Mount Zijin.\n\n*Eighteenth year:* Commanded to perform the **Rain-Praying Rite** at the Divine Music Abbey.\n\n*Twenty-third year:* Specially ordered to oversee the reconstruction of the **Supreme Clarity Palace**.\n\n*Twenty-fourth year, sixth day of the sixth lunar month:*\n**Prohibition Against Unauthorized Issuance of Talismans and Edicts**\nThe Ministry of Rites respectfully transmits the imperial decree: In Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other regions, many falsely invoke the name of Perfected Master Zhang to privately issue talismans and edicts, deluding the people and extorting wealth. Henceforth, any who violate this decree shall be beheaded and their bodies displayed, their families exiled beyond the frontier. *Respect this.*\n\n*Eighth lunar month:* Granted the **Seal of the Orthodox Unity Mysterious Altar of Mount Dragon-Tiger**, to safeguard the sacred mountain and regulate the issuance of talismans.\n\n*Thirty-fifth year:* Bestowed funds for the renovation of the **Supreme Clarity Palace**.\n\n**First Year of Yongle:** Commanded to participate in the sacrifices at the Altar of Heaven.\n\n**Fourth Year:** Commanded to compile and submit Daoist texts.\n*Edict to Perfected Master Zhang Yu Chu:*\nPreviously, you were ordered to compile Daoist scriptures. Complete this task promptly and submit them for comprehensive block-printing.\n*By the Imperial Seal.*\n*Broad and Everlasting.*\n*Nineteenth day of the eleventh lunar month, fourth year of Yongle.*\n\n**Fifth Year:** Commanded to conduct a ritual fast; rewarded with an edict.\n*Edict to Zhang Yu Chu, Perfected Master and Successor of the Orthodox Unity Tradition:*\nWe consider the teachings of the Mysterious Origin to govern the ancestral Dao, opening and closing yin and yang, revolving the divine transformations, harmonizing the Three Realms, and embracing the myriad spirits. Those who practice this Way must attain utmost sincerity to achieve resonance.\n\nUpon the passing of the Empress Renxiao, We specially commanded you to lead the Daoist assembly in conducting the *Yulu* ritual fast and reciting the secret classics from the jade caskets. Within a hundred days, auspicious responses converged: radiant five-colored clouds of blessing, resplendent nine-heavenly mists of fortune. Azure simurghs circled the jade halls, white cranes danced above the alabaster altars. Five-colored auspicious lights shone brightly through the night.\n\nAll this arose from your inheritance of the ancestral Dharma, your resonance with the utmost Perfection, your exploration of the subtleties of the Mysterious Female, and your assistance in the transformations of Emptiness and Non-Being. You have faithfully followed Our command, demonstrating pure sincerity. Moreover, the Daoist assembly cultivated virtuous conduct, preserving refinement and harmony, upholding reverence and devotion, and diligently serving the rites. Among them were also perfected beings of lofty Dao and wondrous transformation, manifesting the subtle and the evident, their spiritual transformations unfathomable. Moved by Our sincere heart, they attended the ritual assembly, bearing witness to the merit of goodness.\n\nOur virtue is meager, and what We cannot comprehend is aided by this assembly of goodness. Thus, the response of the Supreme Mystery was resounding, and abundant auspicious signs gathered. Witnessing these manifest resonances, We are assured that the spirits have received blessing, transcending to the Great Brahmā, forever attaining carefree wandering. This fulfills Our aspirations, and We specially bestow commendation.\n\nHenceforth, you must further exert your divine merit, ever more refining your essence and unity. Penetrate the wondrous transformations, merging with Non-Action. Vastly propagate the ancestral teachings, assisting Our imperial governance.\n*Respect this.*\n*By the Imperial Seal.*\n*Broad and Everlasting.*\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the tenth month in the fifth year of Yongle, *By the Imperial Seal*.\n\nIn the third month of the sixth year, by the Sacred Decree, a section of talismanic registers shall be issued solely by the disciples of Master Zhang the Perfected. *Respect this.*\n\nIn the fourth month, the *Tai Shang Yan Xi Lu* was commanded to be presented, and a five-altar ritual was established. Upon the completion of the rites, special orders were given to provide post station vouchers for the return to the mountain.\n\nA decree was issued to invite the Perfected Immortal Zhang Sanfeng:\n*To Perfected Master Zhang Yuchu,*\nA letter and a censer of incense are now dispatched to invite Perfected Immortal Zhang. When the Perfected Immortal arrives at the mountain, present this decree at once and respectfully invite him to come, that he may console Our earnest longing. *Respect this.*\n*Broad and Everlasting.*\nOn the seventh day of the tenth month in the sixth year of Yongle, *By the Imperial Seal.*\n\nIn the seventh year, a renewed command was issued to seek out Zhang Sanfeng:\nInform Perfected Master Zhang that he must diligently seek out Master Zhang Sanfeng. For several days now, Our spirit has sensed an impending encounter with him. Should he be found, bring him here together with you, ensuring he is treated with utmost reverence—let there be no negligence. *Respect this.*\n*Broad and Everlasting.*\n\nOn the thirteenth day of the eighth month in the seventh year of Yongle, *By the Imperial Seal.*\n\nIn the eighth year, as the Imperial Chariot sojourned in Beijing, the Crown Prince, acting as Regent, dispatched the messenger Chen Kui to offer sacrifices, saying:\nYou early delved into the mysteries of the Dao, carrying forward your ancestral legacy. Abiding in simplicity and embracing emptiness, you illuminated the affairs of the Teaching. Through prayers and offerings, you rendered diligent service, receiving honors and favor for many years. How could it be that in a single moment, you suddenly departed this life? Upon hearing this, We were grieved and sorrowful, and thus specially bestow these sacrificial rites. May your spirit remain undimmed—may it partake of these offerings.\n\nIn the ninth year, moved by profound lamentation, the messenger Xiao Rong was dispatched to convey an additional sacrificial decree:\nYou embraced purity and tranquility, nurturing truth and preserving harmony. You explored the secrets of the Great Mystery and the Supreme Subtlety, comprehending the formless and spontaneous essence of the Boundless. Roaming the Primordial Void, you grasped the pivot of the Dao. With breath like wind and thunder, you governed the transformations of the numinous. You glorified your ancestral tradition, upholding the principles of the Mysterious School. Above, you subtly assisted the imperial order; below, you delivered and uplifted the multitudes. We had hoped you would forever aid in the great felicity—how could you so suddenly ascend as an immortal? Thus, We specially send this messenger to offer sacrifices, to express Our sentiments. May you partake of them.\n\n*End of Scroll Three of The Imperial Decrees and Favors of the August Ming*\n*Scroll Four of The Imperial Decrees and Favors of the August Ming*\n\nThe Forty-Fourth Generation Grand Perfected Zhang Yuqing\n\nIn the eighth year of the Yongle reign, the tenth month, as the imperial procession returned south, he was summoned for an audience and commanded to perform the jiao ritual at the Chaotian Palace.\n\n*Imperial Edict Conferring the Title of Grand Perfected*\n\nBy the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:\n\nWe consider that the Daoist teaching venerates the fundamental purity and emptiness of the Dao, attaining the subtlety of its transformative power. Above, it subtly assists the imperial order; below, it bestows blessings upon the common people. Its esteem in the world has long been thus.\n\nYou, Zhang Yuqing, trace your lineage to the first patriarch, mastering the profound principles of the Mysterious. You have expounded the esoteric Way of the Primordial Chaos and aided the divine workings of creation. Thus, you bring benefit and salvation to the multitudes, transmitting the dharma to your descendants.\n\nYour father and elder brother both reverently received the great favor of Our August Ancestor, the Grand Emperor, who commanded them to oversee the Daoist teachings. Now that your elder brother has passed, you shall succeed him. We specially appoint you as the Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, Successor of the Teaching, Pure and Void, Untrammeled and Radiant, Propagator of the Ancestral Dao, to oversee the affairs of the Daoist teachings.\n\nMay you purify your mind and ever more perfectly attain the Supreme Dao. Expound and glorify the ancestral tradition, forever aiding the imperial felicity. Reverently obey this decree.\n\n*Edict and Patent*\n\nOn the twenty-first day of the eleventh month in the eighth year of Yongle, the imperial seal was affixed. In the eleventh year, having selected devout Daoist adepts, We issued this edict:\n\nTo the Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, Successor of the Teaching, Zhang Yuqing:\n\nYou dispatched the Daoist Wang Youlai to present a memorial, whereupon We showed him the *Lingying Yuan'guang Tu* (Numinous Response and Radiant Light Chart). Yet he, being one unversed in the Dao, gazed upon it in silent bewilderment, unable to utter a word. Before even finishing one or two pages, he sought to depart—his heart truly held no faith. Henceforth, when dispatching envoys, you must select only those who revere and honor the foundational teachings of the Dao. Thus may the Mysterious Gate be glorified and the Daoist lineage be enriched.\n\nBy this edict.\n\n*Seal affixed on the fourth day of the seventh month in the eleventh year of Yongle, under the reign title \"Vast Fortune.\"*\n\n---\n\nA further edict is hereby issued, granting the *Taihe Yuan'guang Tu* (Chart of Supreme Harmony and Radiant Light) and the sacred *langmei* (wax apple):\n\nTo the Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, Successor of the Teaching, Zhang Yuqing:\n\nMount Wudang, a renowned mountain under heaven, is the sacred site where the Perfected Warrior attained the Dao and where numinous responses and transformative influences manifest. At the end of the Yuan dynasty, its palaces and temples were all destroyed by war, leaving Daoist adepts and scholars of cultivation with no place to turn for refuge or reverence.\n\nWith sincerity in Our heart, We commanded the reconstruction of its palaces and temples. Above, this serves to honor the spirits of Our late father and mother in heaven; below, it seeks blessings for all living beings under heaven. The celestial perfected have been moved by this devotion, and numinous responses have repeatedly manifested. Radiant light illumines the heavens, and the *langmei* bears fruit. Your subordinates have reverently presented a painted chart and the *langmei* to offer in sacrifice to the ancestors. Now, to make manifest the divine efficacy, We specially dispatch an envoy to bestow upon you the sacred chart and one hundred *langmei* fruits. You shall receive them with reverence.\n\nBy this edict.\n\n*Vast Fortune.*\n\nOn the fourth day of the seventh month in the eleventh year of the Yongle reign, by the authority of the Imperial Seal,\n\nWe hereby command the selection of abbots for Mount Wudang by Edict:\n\nTo the Orthodox Unity Successor of the Teachings, Perfected Zhang Yuqing—Mount Wudang is a renowned mountain under heaven, the sacred site where the Perfected Warrior attained the Dao and where numinous responses and transformations manifest. At the end of the Yuan dynasty, its palaces and temples were all destroyed by war, leaving Daoist adepts and recluses with no place to turn for refuge or reverence. With sincerity in Our heart, We commanded the reconstruction of its palaces and temples. Above, this serves to honor the spirits of Our late father and mother in heaven; below, it seeks blessings for all living beings under heaven—ensuring timely rains and sunshine, the absence of disasters and calamities, abundant harvests, and sufficiency for every household and individual.\n\nNow that the palaces and temples are completed, the divine spirits have repeatedly shown auspicious responses. Radiant light blazes forth, resplendent in five colors; the sacred images appear luminous within the light. Tens of thousands of observers have all marveled in awe. We have already bestowed names upon them: the Jade Void Palace of the Dark Heavens, the Purple Empyrean Palace of the Great Mystery, the Five Dragons Palace of Flourishing Sanctity, and the Great Sage Palace of the Southern Cliff.\n\nYet this renowned mountain and sublime site must have eminent persons and Daoist adepts to serve as abbots and guardians. For the Great Sage Palace of the Southern Cliff, We have already appointed Sun Biyun of the Right Orthodox Unity as abbot. For the remaining three sites, you shall select two individuals of virtuous conduct to serve as abbots for each. Additionally, choose devout, reverent, and meticulous Daoists—fifty for each site—to serve as guardians. If the number cannot be met at once, assign as many as you have selected to the four sites for guardianship. Let them cultivate with diligence and promote the flourishing of the Daoist teachings.\n\nBy this edict.\n\nIn the expansive reign of the eleventh year of Yongle, on the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month, under the imperial seal, an edict was issued in the ninth month dispatching envoys to the mountain to conduct a seven-day Golden Register Grand Offering at the Great Upper Clarity Palace. Funds were also allocated to purchase fish, which were to be released into the streams. The site was named the \"Mercy Release Pond,\" with a prohibition on netting or angling.\n\nIn the thirteenth year, an edict was issued to renovate the Great Upper Clarity Palace and construct the Zhenyi Abbey. Embankments were built, and a floating bridge was erected.\n\nIn the fifteenth year, the emperor commanded sacrifices to be offered at the Western Sacred Altar and ordered prayers at the Lingji Palace in Fujian for auspicious responses. An edict of commendation was bestowed upon Zhang Yuqing, the Orthodox Unity Lineage Successor and Perfected Master of the Daoist Teachings:\n\n\"Recently, the August Benevolence Perfected Lord conducted a Golden Register Grand Offering at the Lingji Palace in Fujian, performing rites of thanksgiving to the Supreme Perfected Ones and praying on Our behalf. We specifically appointed you to officiate the rituals in Our stead. At the commencement of the altar rites, the overcast skies cleared, and the sun shone brightly. Upon your arrival, you expounded the esoteric scriptures, upheld the grand model, harmonized heaven and humanity, and gathered the myriad spirits. Within seven days, auspicious omens repeatedly manifested, and blessings converged in abundance. Auspicious clouds displayed their five-colored patterns, and sacred ribbons soared with the hues of the nine heavens. Divine numina revealed themselves in wondrous transformations. Azure luan birds and white cranes soared and danced in throngs. All this was due to the August Benevolence Perfected Lord’s bestowed efficacy and manifest numinosity, and also because you illuminated the ancestral model, your Dao resonating with the Supreme Perfected, thereby responding to the reverent solemnity of the rites.\n\nMoreover, the August Benevolence Perfected Lord praised your diligent and sincere supplications, which were witnessed and delighted in by the Supreme Mystery. Without your reverent and meticulous devotion, how could such achievements have been attained? Now, We specially bestow this edict of commendation to express Our esteem. May you further flourish in your Daoist practice and invigorate the mystic winds. Expound and propagate the teachings of purity and emptiness, uphold and inherit the ancestral lineage of the Great Dao. Thereby, Our nation shall forever attain the utmost governance. Respect this mandate.\"\n\nOn the day of the first month, the sixteenth year of Yongle [1418], Imperial Seal affixed.\n\nIn the sixteenth year, an edict was issued summoning Zhang Yuqing, Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity and Successor of the Teachings. Upon receipt of this edict, he was to lead eminent Daoists to court. Thus decreed.\n\n*Broad and Far-reaching*\n\nOn the tenth day of the second month, the sixteenth year of Yongle [1418], Imperial Seal affixed.\n\nIn the third month of this year, an edict commanded the consecration of a golden statue of the Mysterious Emperor at Mount Taihe. In the fifth month, he was ordered to pacify the tidal disasters in Zhejiang.\n\nIn the seventeenth year [1419], an imperial patent was conferred upon Lady Sun, the Mysterious Lord.\n\n*By the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor Proclaims:*\n\nThe honor of a wife reflects that of her husband, as the state has its enduring rites, and the Dao is exalted through its teachings. You, Lady Sun, wife of Zhang Yuqing, Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity, Successor of the Teachings, Radiant Model of Pure Emptiness and Unadorned Simplicity, and Great Perfected One who Propagates the Dao, are of virtuous reverence. Born of a noble family, you were wed to a lineage of immortals. Gentle, refined, serene, and composed, you are respectful, solemn, and harmonious. Your conduct as a wife is exemplary, and thus you are worthy of esteemed favor. Now, We specially confer upon you the title of Mysterious Lord of Serene Integrity, Pure Chastity, Wondrous Kindness, and Profound Wisdom. May you ever reverently uphold this gracious mandate and perpetually illuminate its benevolent charge.\n\n*Proclaimed by Imperial Patent*\n\nOn the fourth day of the first month, the seventeenth year of Yongle [1419], Imperial Seal affixed.\n\nIn the eighteenth year [1420]...\n\nSummoned to audience, he was commanded to lead eighteen hundred feathered transcendents in performing the Great Fast of the Jade Register. In the tenth month of the same year, he was again ordered to conduct the Universal Salvation Great Fast at Lingji. On the first day of the first month of the nineteenth year [1421], he was commanded to preside over the separate offerings at the Altar of the Stars and constellations, and to establish the Rite of Preserving Peace. On the seventh day, the Emperor returned to the capital from his northern campaign. He then ordered the performance of the Great Fast of Thanksgiving and Petition in response to auspicious signs, and issued an imperial rescript to commend and reward the Successor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, Perfected One Zhang Yuqing:\n\n\"Recently, We personally led the Six Armies to campaign against the northern barbarian foes. By the grace and protection of the Supreme Divinity and the August Heavenly Emperor, with the profound assistance of the True Lords, We were initially shielded and safeguarded, ensuring that both officers and steeds returned in peace and health. We cherish this benevolence and virtue deeply, inscribing it indelibly in Our heart. Therefore, We command you to establish the Great Fast of Thanksgiving and Petition, expressly to manifest Our gratitude and to give visible form to Our sincerity.\n\nYou have reverently upheld Our mandate, maintaining utmost purity and sincerity in the fast. With solemn precision, you have invoked the transcendent and propagated the wondrous scriptures, exalting and disseminating the ancestral teachings, thereby moving Heaven and Earth. The numinous powers have responded with luminous favor, and auspicious signs have repeatedly manifested. Ethereal omens—auspicious clouds and multicolored canopies—filled the vast heavens. Wheels of radiance and protective veils, now yellow, now azure, streamed with crimson and trailed purple, their five hues resplendent and dazzling. In lush profusion, they shimmered and flickered, ascending and descending, coiling and unfurling, their transformations beyond reckoning. Moreover, five-colored auspicious lights stretched across the sky, their luminous mists glittering and brilliant, illuminating all with harmonious fusion. Some appeared round like solar chariots, others straight like hanging rainbows; some enveloped the altars and temples, others graced the palace gardens. Mountains and rivers took on enhanced splendor, grasses and trees flourished with greater luster, and both celestial and mortal beings rejoiced, as blessings extended to all, seen and unseen.\n\nOur heart is deeply gratified, beyond the power of words to express. Thus, We specially issue this rescript to commend and reward you, thereby manifesting the wondrousness of this spiritual resonance. You must further cultivate your meritorious deeds, broadly propagate the treasury of teachings, perpetually assist in the grand enterprise, subtly support the imperial order, bring fortune to the state and benefit the people, and so fulfill Our earnest and unwavering aspirations.\"\n\nBy this rescript, so commanded.\n\nOn the __ day of the __ month, in the nineteenth year of the Yongle reign, [issued under] the \"Treasure of the __ Year.\" In the twenty-second year, an Offering Ritual was commanded at Mount Taihe; a Great Purification Fast for Auspicious Responses was established, and this rescript of reward was conferred.\n\nTo Zhang Yuqing, Perpetuating the Teachings of the Orthodox Unity, We reflect: the Supreme Emperor’s virtue lies in cherishing life, and thus the Mysterious Origin’s teachings center on benevolent salvation. The true essence is pure, tranquil, and non-action; its function is spiritually wondrous and boundless. Those who attain its mystery can manifest its works—above, subtly supporting the imperial order; below, extending blessings to all, seen and unseen. Records from past dynasties provide clear evidence of this.\n\nWe, reverently upholding Heaven’s mandate and diligently serving the Supreme Emperor, day and night reflect upon Our late imperial father and mother, whose sagely spirits abide above. Our longing knows no limit, and We recall their great toil and virtue. Unable to repay them, We respectfully follow the Daoist teachings, summoning Daoist masters from across the realm to conduct the Great Purification Fast for Auspicious Responses.\n\nYou have faithfully carried out Our command, personally leading the Daoist assembly to devote your utmost sincerity, expounding the treasury of teachings, and conveying Our sincerity. The divine response was luminous: from the ritual’s beginning to its conclusion, the heavens remained serene and bright. Even in the freezing month, no gales arose; harmonious qi suffused all, auspicious signs shone forth, and blessings gathered—rooted in the Supreme Emperor’s and Our late imperial parents’ gracious regard, as well as your reverent fulfillment of Our mandate, thereby achieving this.\n\nWe commend and reward you, and further issue this rescript of encouragement. Strive ever more to refine your Dao, deepen your conduct, and propagate the Mysterious Teachings—above, to pray for the fortune of the imperial ancestral temple, and below, to universally benefit all living beings. Let this be your earnest endeavor.\n\nBy this rescript, so commanded.\n\nOn a day in the twenty-second year of the Yongle reign, under the imperial seal, and in the first year of the Xuande reign, [the recipient] was summoned for an audience and granted a banquet in the inner palace.\n\nBy decree, extending grace and bestowing an honorific title:\n\nTo Zhang Yuqing, the Great Perfected of Orthodox Unity, Successor to the Teaching, We reflect: the Dao of the Mysterious Origin precedes heaven and earth, its beginning unseen; it follows heaven and earth, its end unseen. It is the root of all beings and the wondrous pivot of the myriad transformations. Yet its fundamental nature is utterly pure, still, and non-action. Thus, successive dynasties have honored and rewarded it to propagate governance through purity and stillness.\n\nOur dynasty reveres the teaching of virtue and power. Your father and elder brother both served with reverence. Having succeeded to their office, Our imperial ancestor, the Emperor Taizong, bestowed upon you a noble title and favored you with profound grace—this was the utmost. You have upheld sincerity and reverence, not dishonoring the honor of your mandate, for over a decade. In serving Our late imperial father, the Emperor Renzong, you likewise fulfilled your duties with reverence and care.\n\nConsidering what Our ancestors valued, We extend filial grace and bestow upon you this honorific title: *Great Perfected of Orthodox Unity, Successor to the Teaching, Pure Emptiness and Tranquil Simplicity, Radiant Ancestral Dao, Reverent Humility and Guarded Stillness, Master of the Profound Mystery*, charged with overseeing the affairs of the Daoist teachings throughout the realm.\n\nStillness is the root of the Dao; humility is the handle of virtue. Abide in tranquility with simplicity; tread humbly with reverence. In stillness, there is peace; in peace, there is unity. In humility, there is emptiness; in emptiness, there is clarity. Cast aside distractions and embrace simplicity; cultivate sincerity and radiance will follow. Of all the essentials in the pursuit of the Mysterious Dao, what could be more pressing than upholding these? May you greatly propagate the ancestral teachings—strive earnestly!\n\nBy this decree.\n\nDecree for the sacrificial offering:\n\nYou have devotedly cultivated the Mysterious and Unadorned, aspiring to purity and emptiness. You have mastered the precepts of the ritual codes and delved into the subtleties of the Pure and Subtle. You have illuminated the model of the Dao and gloriously upheld the ancestral teachings. In serving the previous courts, you repeatedly demonstrated diligence and sincerity.\n\nWe, having inherited the great mandate, extended grace and bestowed honors, hoping for a long and flourishing era. Yet you, guiding with utmost sincerity, have now suddenly departed. The news of your passing reached Us, and We are deeply grieved. Thus, We specially dispatch envoys to bestow upon you these sacrificial and burial rites. May your spirit, undimmed, partake in these offerings.\n\n*Concluding the fourth scroll of Imperial Ming Grace and Mandates*\n*Beginning the fifth scroll of Imperial Ming Grace and Mandates*\n\nThe Forty-Fifth Grand Perfected Zhang Maocheng\n\nIn the thirty-second year of the Hongwu reign, his father Zhang Yuli was summoned by the Grand Emperor Taizu for his virtue, alongside the Perfected of Non-Action Yu Chu. Both were received in audience and met with imperial favor. The emperor specially commanded the Censor-in-Chief, the Earl of Sincere Intent Liu Ji, to betroth his younger brother’s daughter to him.\n\nIn the second year of the Xuande reign, he was summoned to court and granted an imperial banquet in the side hall. In the fourth year, he was again summoned and commanded to present the *Tai Shang Yan Xi Lu* (*Record of the Supreme Prolonging of Felicity*). He was further ordered to conduct the *Yan Xi* Offering within the palace. In the fourth month, he was commanded to participate in the sacrifices at the Imperial Ancestral Temple.\n\n**Imperial Edict Conferring the Title of Grand Perfected**\n\nBy the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:\nWe hold that the Dao of the Mysterious Origin is pure, quiescent, and non-active, the root of all relations and the wondrous essence of the myriad transformations. Above, it harmonizes governance; below, it bestows beneficence upon the living. Since ancient times, it has been honored and encouraged.\n\nYou, Zhang Maocheng, have inherited from your forebears the cultivation of the Supreme Dao. Your grandfather and father both reverently upheld it. Now, as you succeed them, We specially appoint you as the Grand Perfected of Orthodox Unity, Successor to the Teaching, Cultivator of the Supreme Dao, Preserver of Simplicity, and Expounder of the Dharma, to oversee the affairs of the Daoist teachings.\n\nYou shall devoutly uphold the model of the Mysterious, gloriously uphold the ancestral teachings, guide and welcome great felicity, and assist in the flourishing of the imperial destiny. Hold this in awe and act accordingly.\n\nDecree and Edict\nProclaimed on a day in the fourth month of the fourth year of Xuande, under the Imperial Seal.\nIn the fifth year, commanded to offer sacrifices at the Eastern Sacred Mount Altar. Commanded to perform the jiao ritual at the Hall of Benevolence and Wisdom. In the third month, the Emperor held court at the Western Palace and summoned for audience, bestowing upon the eminent Daoist masters of the Supreme Clarity Palace—Cao Kehong, Gong Jizong, Ying Fu, Yuan Huang, and Jia You—the title of Daoist Registrar, and dispatched the eunuch official Li Du to the mountain to escort them.\n\nPosthumous Edict for Madame Sun, the Mysterious Lady\nBy the Mandate of Heaven and the Grace of the Emperor, a decree is issued:\nThe state has long honored and rewarded the Daoist teachings, and to the successors of the Orthodox Unity Perfected, it has already granted titles of esteem. Yet the inner support of these successors—those who assist from within—should also share in this glory. The Grand Perfected of Orthodox Unity, Successor to the Teaching, Cultivator of the Supreme Dao, Preserver of Simplicity, and Expounder of the Dharma, who oversees the affairs of the Daoist teachings, Zhang Maocheng, had as his wife Madame Sun. Though she was still fulfilling her role as inner support, she suddenly passed away. Now, she is posthumously honored as the Gentle, Kind, Chaste, and Serene Mysterious Lady. May her spirit remain undimmed and ever capable of receiving and upholding this grace.\n\nDecree and Edict\nProclaimed on the twentieth day of the intercalary twelfth month of the fifth year of Xuande, under the Imperial Seal.\nIn the sixth year.\n\nDecreed to officiate at the Star and Constellation Altar.

In the same month, he was commanded to present the *Tai Shang Yan Xi Lu*.\n\nHe was commanded to officiate at the Eastern Sacred Mount Altar. In the second month, on the Empress Dowager’s sacred birthday, a prayer and offering ritual was held at Chaotian Palace.\n\n**Fifth Year**\nEnfeoffment of Lady Dong as *Xuanjun* (Mysterious Lady) by Imperial Edict\n\nBy the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:\nThe state, recognizing the Daoist teachings for their hidden yet resplendent contributions to the imperial order, traces their origins and honors their descendants. Extending grace to their households is also an enduring tradition.\n\nZhang Maocheng, the *Zhenyi* Lineage Successor, Grand Cultivator of the Supreme Dao, Preserver of Simplicity, Dharma-Propagating Great Perfected, and Overseer of Daoist Affairs, has taken Lady Dong as his second wife. In accordance with her husband’s eminence, she is hereby specially enfeoffed by imperial edict as *Wenjing Rou Shun Xuanjun* (Serene, Gentle, and Compliant Mysterious Lady).\nMay she reverently uphold this honor and forever maintain the dignity of her household.\nRespect this decree.\n\n*Imperial Edict*\nSecond month, fifth year of Zhengtong\n[Seal]\n\nIn the third month of the same year, he was commanded to commission a golden statue of the Dark Warrior Emperor of Xuan and perform an offering ritual at the Palace’s Temple of the Dark Heaven.\n\n**Sixth Year**\nHe was commanded to officiate at the Eastern Sacred Mount Altar.

An edict was conferred, appointing him **Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity, Successor to the Teachings, Serene and Unadorned, Preserver of the Ancestral and Upholder of the Daoist Law**.\n\n**Eleventh Year**\nHe was summoned to an audience and granted a banquet in the Hall of Benevolence and Wisdom.\n\n**Imperial Edict Conferring Posthumous Title upon His Father Zhang Liugang**\n\nBy the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:\nWe hold that in the state’s treatment of its ministers, grace must extend to their kin, for this is how the roots of reverence are deepened.\nYou, Zhang Liugang, father of the **Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity, Successor to the Teachings, Serene and Unadorned, Preserver of the Ancestral and Upholder of the Daoist Law**, Yuanji, were rightfully entitled to the shelter of the Dao’s blessings, yet did not live to see a long life. Now, by virtue of the grace extended to your son, We posthumously confer upon you the title **Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity, Successor to the Teachings, Cultivator of the Mysterious, Nurturer of Simplicity, and Embracer of Stillness**. May your spirit in the unseen realm reverently uphold this honor.\n\n*Imperial Edict*\nTwenty-second day of the sixth month, eleventh year of Zhengtong\n\n**Imperial Edict Conferring Title upon Mother Gao**\n\nBy the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees: A wife shares in her husband’s honor—this is the great grace of the court. A mother rises with her son’s distinction—this is the established custom of the state. You, consort of the posthumously titled **Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity, Successor to the Teachings, Cultivator of the Mysterious, Nurturer of Simplicity, and Embracer of Stillness**, Zhang Liugang, and mother of the **Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity, Successor to the Teachings, Serene and Unadorned, Preserver of the Ancestral and Upholder of the Daoist Law**, Yuanji, have upheld your resolve within the Mystic Gate, thereby fostering your son’s attainment. We now specially confer upon you the title **Compassionate and Benevolent, Tranquil and Chaste Mystic Lady**. May you wear this honor with grace and thereby elevate the Way of Motherhood. Reverently accept this decree.\n\n*Imperial Edict*\nTwenty-second day of the sixth month, eleventh year of Zhengtong\n\n**Imperial Seal**\n\n---\n\n**Twelfth Year**\n**Imperial Decree Prohibiting Oppression by Clan Members**\n\nThe Emperor commands and instructs the **Mystic Lady of Serene Gentleness and Submissive Virtue**, Dong: The court sustains the Daoist teachings, prioritizing the protection of the good and the punishment of the wicked to ensure enduring order. Formerly, upon the passing of the Perfected Zhang Maocheng, We appointed his rightful grandson, Zhang Yuanji, to inherit the title of Perfected and oversee the affairs of the teachings. Yet certain members of his clan have repeatedly engaged in oppression and harm. Those who have already transgressed shall be duly punished by law.\n\nStill, the relevant authorities are commanded to issue directives to the Surveillance Commission and the Three Provincial Offices. Should any persist in flouting the law and perpetrating oppression, they shall be punished without exception.\n\nNow, We bestow upon Zhang Yuanji this decree of encouragement, that he may diligently cultivate and refine himself to worthily uphold the affairs of the teachings. Furthermore, the Daoists Gao Jinyun and Zhou Yingyu are appointed as Assistant Instructors, while Yan Ju and Xi Kezhong are designated as Scribes, tasked solely with aiding Zhang Yuanji in his duties.\n\nAs for you, Mystic Lady, being his grandmother and long invested with imperial favor, you shall, in all matters concerning the household, instruct and admonish your grandson morning and evening, urging him to devote himself to study and cultivation, and to take utmost care in his protection, that he may attain maturity. Thus shall it redound to the fortune of your lineage.\n\nIn all external affairs requiring action, he shall deliberate thoroughly with Gao Jinyun and the others before proceeding, ensuring all measures are fitting and conducive to long-term stability. Should any among the clan members persist in stirring trouble beyond bounds or scheming to harm your family, Gao Jinyun and the others shall report the facts in full to the Surveillance Commission and the Three Provincial Offices, who will arrest and interrogate them according to law, and memorialize for their punishment without pardon.\n\nYet if Gao Jinyun and the others presume upon this authority to bully your grandson Yuanji, you shall likewise present the truth to the Surveillance Commission and the Three Provincial Offices to lodge a complaint, and they shall be arrested and interrogated in the same manner.\n\nYou, above all, must govern your household with strictness, foster harmony among the clan with kindness, and admonish your family members to refrain from encroaching upon others. Thus shall you be worthy of the court’s esteem and favor, and your family shall be preserved in perpetuity. Reverently accept this decree.\n\n**Imperial Mandate**\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the fifth month in the twelfth year of the Zhengtong reign, the imperial seal was affixed to the edict bestowing the Daoist Canon.\n\n**Imperial Edict**\nEmbracing the heart of Heaven and Earth to protect the people, We reverently fulfill the will of Our august great-great-grandfather. Having printed the Daoist Canon, We now bestow it upon the realm to broaden its transmission. This complete set shall be enshrined at the Supreme Clarity Palace on Mount Longhu, to be eternally venerated. Local Daoist officials and priests are permitted to read, recite, and extol its teachings. Above, it shall serve to pray for the nation’s blessings; below, to seek fortune for the people. All must diligently uphold and safeguard it, forbidding idle or unauthorized persons from borrowing it for casual perusal, lest they treat it with irreverence, causing damage or loss. Violators shall be investigated and punished without exception.\n**Imperial Mandate**\n\nOn the tenth day of the eighth month in the twelfth year of the Zhengtong reign, the imperial seal was affixed.\n\nIn the fourteenth year, an edict was issued to offer sacrifices at the Altar of the Stars and Constellations. In the seventh month, the Empress commanded the performance of a *Bao’an* Offering within the palace.\n\nIn the first year of the Jingtai reign, an edict was issued to perform a *Bao’an* Offering at the Great Virtue Abbey.\n\nIn the second year, an edict was issued to grant one thousand ordination certificates, permitting the ordination of Daoist priests. In the third year, an edict commanded the performance of an Offering within the palace; upon its completion, a banquet was bestowed at the Hall of Benevolence and Wisdom. In the fourth year, an edict commanded the division of sacrifices at the Altar of Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain, and an Offering was performed at the Temple of Heavenly Audience. In the sixth year, an edict commanded an Offering at the Abbey of Numinous Aid, and a patent of investiture was conferred, ennobling the *Zhengyi* Lineage Master, Inheritor of the Dao, Profound Emptiness and Pristine Simplicity, Continuer of the Ancestral Teachings, Exalter of the Dharma, Serene and Tranquil, Mysterious and Unified Great Perfected One as Administrator of Daoist Affairs throughout the realm. A ritual sword was bestowed, and a eunuch official was specially dispatched to escort him back to his mountain.\n\nIn the first year of the Tianshun reign, the second month:\nHe was summoned to court and commanded to perform an Offering of Prayer and Thanksgiving within the palace.\n\nIn the same year:\nA prohibition was issued against unauthorized persons privately issuing talismans or divination tallies.\n\n**Imperial Edict**\nTo the *Zhengyi* Lineage Master, Inheritor of the Dao, Profound Emptiness and Pristine Simplicity, Continuer of the Ancestral Teachings, Exalter of the Dharma, Serene and Tranquil, Mysterious and Unified Great Perfected One, Administrator of Daoist Affairs throughout the realm, Zhang Yuanji:\n\nWe consider that the state’s veneration and encouragement of the Daoist teachings serve to subtly manifest the hidden and explicate the obscure, to pray for blessings and shelter the people, thereby aiding the flourishing of grand harmony and great peace. Yet the teachings must be rooted in their source to empower their methods. Since the time of Our Ancestors, the regulation of Daoist affairs has never been neglected. Recently, We have heard that in various places, some have falsely assumed the name of Perfected Zhang, privately issuing talismans and scriptures to delude the people and extort wealth, which utterly contravenes the original intent of the Daoist teachings and their numinous methods. You, Zhang Yuanji, are the eldest grandson of the late Perfected Zhang Maocheng. When We ascended the throne, We already commanded you to inherit your ancestor’s office. Mindful of your youth and orphaned state, We feared you might fall prey to harm, and thus repeatedly issued prohibitions and admonitions.\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\nNow We again issue this edict, commanding you, your kinsmen, and the Daoist priests of this mountain’s abbeys and temples to each adhere strictly to ritual and law, revering and holding fast to devotion. Let none dare to bully, encroach, or stir up trouble. Should any persist in falsely using your name to privately issue talismans, they shall be punished with the full severity of the law. You must purify your heart and diligently study, reverently upholding the mysterious model, flourishing the ancestral teachings, and not letting the legacy of your forebears fall into decline. Hold this in awe and obey it—do not neglect it.\n\nBy Edict.\nThe first day of the seventh month of the first year of the Tianshun reign, the Great Yuan era.\n\n[Seal]\n\nIn the third year, summoned to audience and granted a banquet in the inner court, again commanded to present the *Tai Shang Yanxi Lu*.\nIn the fourth year, the Emperor held audience in the fasting palace.\nConferred the title of Grand Mysterious Lady upon Lady Gao by proclamation.\n\nBearing Heaven and Receiving the Mandate, the Emperor’s Decree states: We consider the descendants of the numinous and enlightened to be those whom the state exalts. Those who inherit the teachings are granted the title of Perfected, while those who support them are bestowed the title of Mysterious Lady, thereby honoring and rewarding the Way of the Mysterious Origin without end. You, the Kind, Benevolent, Serene, and Pure Mysterious Lady Gao, are the wife of the posthumously enfeoffed Perfected Liu Gang, Keeper of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, Cultivator of the Mysterious, Nurturer of Simplicity, and Embracer of Stillness; and the mother of Zhang Yuanji, Perfected of Orthodox Unity, Inheritor of the Teachings, Preserver of Emptiness, Guardian of Simplicity, Continuer of the Ancestral Line, Upholder of the Mysterious Law, Embracer of Tranquility, Delighter in Stillness, Grand Perfected of the Mysterious Union, and Keeper of the Affairs of the Daoist Teachings Under Heaven. Early widowed, you preserved your chastity and lived as a lone widow, raising and nurturing your orphaned child to maturity. At this time, the flourishing of the ancestral teachings is entirely due to your efforts. Thus, We specially elevate you to the title of Grand Mysterious Lady, retaining your former honorific, and bestow upon you this proclamation to manifest Our praise and commendation. Strive ever more to uphold your chastity, that you may draw near to sublime fortune and thereby display Our grace and favor. Hold this in awe.\n\nBy Imperial Decree, on the sixth day of the second month in the fourth year of Tianshun, the Seal was affixed. In the fourth month of the fifth year, the Emperor dispatched an envoy to the mountain, summoning [the recipient] to the capital to officiate the jiao rites at the Imperial Xuantian Shrine. In the seventh month, [the Emperor] commanded [the recipient] to perform the qi and xie rites of expiation and supplication at Chaotian Palace. Upon the conclusion of the rites, [the recipient] was summoned for an audience. The petition was approved, and a general amnesty was granted throughout the realm.\n\nIn the third month of the sixth year, [the recipient’s] request to return to the mountain was granted. Upon reaching You River, the Emperor specially dispatched Liu Sheng, a Hundred-Household Officer of the Embroidered Uniform Guard, to escort [the recipient] with the originally bestowed talismans and credentials, further assigning mounted couriers and red-pennant attendants for the journey.\n\nIn the eighth year, [the Emperor] commanded the establishment of a gui and xie jiao rite within the inner court and bestowed an edict conferring the title of **Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, Embodiment of the Dao, Comprehender of the Law, Profound in Silence, Serene in Emptiness, Expounder of the Dao, Propagator of Transformation, and Wondrously Responsive** upon [the recipient]. A second edict was issued to further honor Lady Gao, the Grand Mysterious Lady:\n\n**By the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:**\nWe consider that those of divine lineage who propagate the Dao of Primordial Mystery are duly honored by the state, and that grace is further extended to their kin, thereby venerating the root and perpetuating the Way of filial piety without end.\n\nYou, the **Kind, Benevolent, Serene, and Virtuous Grand Mysterious Lady Gao**, are the mother of **Zhang Yuanji, Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, Embodiment of the Dao, Comprehender of the Law, Profound in Silence, Serene in Emptiness, Expounder of the Dao, Propagator of Transformation, and Wondrously Responsive, who oversees the affairs of the Daoist teachings under Heaven**. Early widowed, you preserved your chastity and lived as a lone widow, raising and nurturing your orphaned child, thereby flourishing the ancestral teachings. Your conduct as wife and mother shines within the inner chambers. In recognition of these mysterious virtues, We fittingly bestow praise.\n\nThus, by Our father’s decree, We specially elevate you to the title of **Kind, Harmonious, Upright, Benevolent, Chaste, and Virtuous Grand Mysterious Lady**, bestowing upon you this proclamation to manifest Our exceptional favor. Strive ever more to cultivate virtuous power, that you may draw near to sublime fortune for eternity. Hold this in awe.\n\n**By Imperial Decree.**\n\nOn the twelfth day of the seventh month in the eighth year of Tianshun, the imperial seal was affixed. In the first year of Chenghua, the Emperor ascended the Hall of Literary Brilliance to receive her in audience and granted a banquet within the palace. In the second year, on the first month, the Emperor dispatched an inner eunuch to present fine horses from the imperial stables, along with brocade, vermilion slippers, wine, and fruits as gifts in celebration of her longevity. The following day, she was again feasted in the inner court. On the eleventh day, she was commanded to preside over the offerings at the Altar of Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain. In the second month, she was ordered to conduct the Ascension to Perfection Ritual at the Temple of Great Virtue.\n\nAn edict was issued to prohibit the counterfeiting of talismans and registers:\n\nTo the **Grand Perfected Zhang Yuanji, Successor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, Embodier of the Dao, Awakened to the Dharma, Profound in Silence, Serene in Emptiness, Propagator of Transformation, and Wondrously Responsive**, We reflect that the Daoist teachings possess the merit of protecting the state and sheltering the people, just as the laws of the realm possess the statutes for rewarding good and punishing evil—these principles and circumstances mutually sustain one another and cannot be lacking.\n\nYour ancestors were descendants of the divine and enlightened, and for generations, the rightful eldest heirs have succeeded one another in overseeing the Daoist teachings, a tradition of long standing. When you were orphaned in youth, your kinsmen and others sought to encroach and seize your position. Relying on the sagacity of Our late imperial father, he specially commanded that you inherit the office of your ancestor, the Perfected Zhang Maocheng. He then bestowed upon you moving prohibitions to safeguard and preserve the security of both realms. Yet, as time passed and people grew obstinate, harm might still arise. Thus, We again grant you this edict, instructing you and your kinsmen to each uphold ritual propriety, revere the Mysterious Teachings, and forbid overstepping bounds or encroachment. Furthermore, no unscrupulous individuals shall be permitted to falsely invoke your name, privately issue talismans or registers to extort wealth, or act contrary to the Dao and its laws. Those who violate this shall be punished with severe penalties without mercy.\n\nWe further appoint the Daoists Deng Yuxuan and Wang Shaotong as Assistant Instructors, and Lin Zhimao and Zhu Wenji as Scribes, to aid you in your duties. Strive to embody Our profound intentions, devote yourself to the Mysterious Teachings, flourish the ancestral traditions, offer prayers for the state’s felicity, and supplicate blessings for the people, thereby fulfilling the court’s esteem and encouragement. Hold this in awe.\n\n**By Edict.**\n**Guangyun**\n\nIn the third month of the second year of Chenghua, on a certain day, the imperial seal was affixed. In the third year, the Emperor ascended the Great Goodness Hall for an audience. The Sagely Address exhorted him to protect the state and safeguard the people, and by special grace, bestowed anew the gold-engraved seal of the *Zhengyi Sijiao* Great Perfected Master’s Mansion, along with a jade seal. The Emperor personally inscribed the four characters \"Great Perfected Master’s Mansion\" and conferred them upon the gate plaque of the mansion. A proclamation was issued, further ennobling him as *Zhengyi Sijiao Tixuan Chongmo Wufa Tongzhen Chandao Honghua Fude Yousheng Miaoying* Great Perfected Master, charged with overseeing the Daoist teachings throughout the realm. An emissary, the eunuch Qin Qin, was dispatched to present gifts including python robes and a jade belt. In the fifth year, he was commanded to perform a jiao ritual at the Chaotian Palace.\n\n*End of Volume Six of* **Imperial Ming Grace and Mandates Through the Ages**\n\n---\n\n**Volume Seven of** *Imperial Ming Grace and Mandates Through the Ages*\n\n**The Forty-Seventh Generation Great Perfected Master, Zhang Xuanging**\n\nIn the thirteenth year of Chenghua, he was summoned for an audience. The Emperor commanded the eunuch Liang Fang to transmit the imperial decree, betrothing the daughter of Duke Cheng of the State, Zhu Yi, to him. The following year, he was ordered to personally proceed to Nanjing to complete the marriage rites, and was further bestowed python robes and a jade belt, with an escort of mounted guards and red banners for his return to the mountain.\n\n**Imperial Proclamation Conferring the Title of Great Perfected Master**\n\nBy the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:\n\nWe hold that the flourishing of the Mysterious Teachings harmonizes the unseen with the principles of transformation, and the grand propagation of ancestral traditions lies in refinement, in diligence, and in sincerity. The succession of lineage must be upheld, and those worthy of exaltation shall be honored without stint.\n\nZhang Xuanging, descendant of a divine and illustrious line, scion of a blessed and noble house, is commendable for his alertness and acuity, and esteemed for his devotion to tranquility and emptiness. Now, as you inherit your ancestors’ legacy, We specially appoint you as *Zhengyi Sijiao Baohe Yangsu Jizu Shoudao* Great Perfected Master, charged with overseeing the Daoist teachings. Strive ever more in your cultivation, lead by the standards of the Dao, uphold the established precepts, and forever pray for the state’s prosperity. Herein lies your duty—hold this in awe.\n\n*By Proclamation.*\nThe twenty-first day of the twelfth month, the thirteenth year of Chenghua.\n\n**Seal of the Edict Conferring the Title of Mysterious Lady upon the Mother of Wu**\n\nBy the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor proclaims:\n\nWe hold that the Supreme Dao is nameless, yet those who cultivate its Way command reverence. Lineage has its origins, and those who deepen its roots shall see grace extend to the Mystic Gate. Wu Qing Sun, ennobled by imperial favor, owes his distinction to his mother’s virtue. You, Lady Wu, mother of Zhang Xuanging, *Zhengyi Sijiao Baohe Yangsu Jizu Shoudao* Great Perfected Master, have long embodied gentle kindness and harmonious grace. Your merit lies in guiding your son to fulfillment, and thus you are fittingly honored with this august decree. We hereby confer upon you the title of *Zhishun Shujing Xuanjun*, Mysterious Lady of Devoted Compliance and Serene Virtue. Wear this abundant grace, and may your example forever illuminate the model of the inner chambers. Hold this in awe.\n\n*By Proclamation.*\nThe twenty-first day of the twelfth month, the thirteenth year of Chenghua.\n\n**Seal**\n\n---\n\n**Imperial Edict Banning the Forgery of Talismans and Divination Tallies**\n\nThe Emperor hereby admonishes all military, civilian, and persons of every rank:\n\nWe note that Longhu Mountain in Guixi County, Guangxin Prefecture, is the ancestral seat and teaching domain of the Zhang Perfected. Since ancient times, talismans and registers have been transmitted by their lineage to the people. During the Hongwu era, decrees were issued to prohibit forgery, lest deceivers mislead the populace and extort wealth. In the Yongle era, it was ordained that fish be purchased and released into the mountain’s rivers to nurture life, forbidding all from netting or angling. Yet of late, powerful and unscrupulous rogues have repeatedly forged talismans and stolen fish, defying the imperial prohibitions. Now, as the *Sijiao* Perfected Zhang Xuanging petitions for redress, We issue this stern decree:\n\nHenceforth, should any military, civilian, or person of any rank dare to persist in obstinacy, forging talismans or stealing fish, local authorities shall apprehend and interrogate them. Should officials fail to enforce this, they shall be punished without exception.\n\n*By Edict.*\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the second month in the twentieth year of the Chenghua era, [the Edict] was sealed.\n\nIn the twenty-first year, the Jiangxi provincial authorities were specially ordered to rebuild the Residence of the Grand Perfected. Incense was sent to Mount Dahua and the Iron Pillar Abbey.\n\nIn the twenty-second year, [the Grand Perfected] was summoned for an audience and ordered to perform a jiao ritual in the Qin’an Hall.\n\nIn the third year of the Hongzhi era, an edict was issued to hold a jiao ritual in the inner court to pray for imperial heirs. The following year, with the birth of the Crown Prince, gifts of jade belts, golden crowns, and python robes were bestowed.\n\nIn the ninth year, the eunuchs Li Jin and Li Zhen were imperially dispatched bearing an edict to hold a grand jiao ritual for the protection of the people at the Shangqing Palace, with the provincial governor and officials from the two bureaus officiating.\n\nIn the eleventh year, an edict was issued to hold a jiao ritual for snow at the Chaotian Palace.\n\nIn the twelfth year, two ivory seals were bestowed, and [the Grand Perfected] was ordered to present the *Taishang Yianxi Lu*.\n\nIn the fourteenth year, upon receiving an imperial summons to court, the Emperor received [the Grand Perfected] in the Qin’an Hall, commanded him to be seated, and bestowed a banquet.\n\nIn the fifteenth year, [the Grand Perfected] was ordered to assist in the sacrifices at the Changling Mausoleum. An edict permitting retirement was granted.\n\n*Edict to Zhang Xuanging, Grand Perfected and Successor of the Orthodox Unity Dao:*\nWhereas your ancestors have, for generations, presided over the Daoist teachings, inheriting titles and ranks down to you, who have upheld this lineage without interruption for many years—now, as you have arrived in the capital to pay homage and petitioned on account of illness, seeking retirement and proposing that your son, Zhang Yanxun, succeed to the office of Perfected, We hereby grant your request.\n\nYou, now in leisure, should dwell in quietude, nurturing body and spirit. As for Yanxun, he must master the ritual arts with precision, uphold the dignity of his rank, carry forward the ancestral legacy, and bring no disgrace to his forebears, thus fulfilling the favor bestowed by the court. Take heed, take heed.\n\n*By Edict.*\n*Guangyun*\n\nOn the nineteenth day of the third month in the fifteenth year of Hongzhi, the imperial seal was affixed. In this year, incense of tribute was commanded to ascend to the celestial sun, and to the mountains of Ge the Immortal, Huagai, Wudang, and Heming, where an edict was dispatched, ordering the commander of Tongzhou Guard to lead officials and soldiers in escorting [the Perfected] back to their mountains.\n\nIn the eighteenth year, an imperial letter of inquiry and commendation was bestowed. The Emperor’s missive to Zhang Xuanqing, Retired Perfected and Successor of the Orthodox Unity Dao, read:\n\nWe reflect that the profound Daoist wind has flourished greatly, establishing the Three Ultimates upon the terrace of spring. The transformative rain has spread evenly, raising the Eight Wastelands to the realm of longevity. The lineage extends through the immortal genealogy, its blessings flowing into the imperial enterprise. Your endeavors have been refined through diligent cultivation, and your merits shine brightly in assisting the grand design.\n\nYou, with your noble bearing and unrestrained spirit, possess a nature of pure sincerity. You have transmitted the century-old glory of your ancestors and exalted the ten-thousand-year renown of Heaven and Earth. When you received the tally and assumed your mandate, you devoted yourself wholly to your duties. Upon relinquishing your sash and returning to the mountains, you turned to the truth in reclusion. Not a speck of dust has stained you, as you polish the three-foot ice-jade vessel of your being; all myriad cares have dissolved, as you clarify the serene moon of the nine heavens. You transcend the mundane to enter sageliness, taming tigers and subduing dragons. Among springs and rocks, you cultivate loftiness; with zither and books, you find delight. Beholding the wondrous Dao of emptiness and tranquility, you truly embody the radiant light of salvation.\n\nNow, with fine robes of multicolored silk gathered about your knees and verdant trees filling your sight, you are fortunate that neither honor nor disgrace disturbs you. We long to behold your pure countenance and cherish distant thoughts of you. Moreover, your words carry weight, and your devotion is earnest—We trust you shall uphold this.\n\n*Guangyun*\nOn the twenty-second day of the second month in the eighteenth year of Hongzhi.\n\n**Edict Prohibiting the Forgery of Talismans and Tallies**\n\n*Imperial Edict to Zhang Xuanging, Retired Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Lineage and Successor to the Teachings:*\n\nIn recent years, talismans and registers have been recklessly transmitted everywhere. We have already commanded the Ministry of Rites to issue a decree enforcing a universal prohibition, which must be strictly observed. During the Hongwu and Yongle reigns, all precedents required that such matters be requested and granted solely through the office of the Grand Perfected Successor to the Teachings. You must take heed of Our intent and also restrain those under your household, ensuring they uphold the imperial decree. Let none dare forge or profane these sacred instruments, that the pure regulations may remain unsullied and the wondrous Dao ever exalted.\n\n*Thus decreed.*\n\n*Guangyun*\nOn the twenty-second day of the third month in the eighteenth year of Hongzhi.\n\n---\n\n**Edict Granting a Scroll and Silver Silk to the Retired Grand Perfected**\n\n*Imperial Edict to Zhang Xuanging, Retired Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Lineage and Successor to the Teachings:*\n\nYour disciple, the Grand Perfected Zhang Yanling, has come to court bearing a sacred image, divine talismans, an ancient sword, and other precious offerings, all presented with utmost sincerity. We have learned that your conduct remains pure and admirable, and that you enjoy harmony and peace—this deeply comforts Our heart. Herewith, We send a painted scroll, refined silver, and silk fabrics as tokens of Our distant regard. You shall receive and cherish them.\n\n*Thus decreed.*\n\n*Guangyun*\n\n**Edict Granting Incense and Candles for Ritual Offerings**\n\n*Imperial Edict to Zhang Xuanging, Retired Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Lineage and Successor to the Teachings:*\n\nWe have received your memorial, informing Us of your intention to journey to the three sacred sites of Mount Wudang, Mount Heming, and Mount Gexian. Given the mild and harmonious weather, with the people and all things flourishing, such a pilgrimage may be undertaken at your leisure.\n\nHerewith, We grant you leave to proceed to Mount Heming at an auspicious time of your choosing. However, should the journey prove arduous, with rugged paths that might weary you, you may instead dispatch an attendant to convey incense and sincerity in your stead—this, too, shall suffice for your devotion.\n\nWe earnestly hope you will take care of your well-being, return swiftly to your immortal teachings, and thus fulfill Our expectations. Enclosed are nine portions of incense and candles, to be forwarded with this decree. We entrust you to present them on Our behalf, as a token of Our reverent devotion.\n\n*Thus decreed.*\n\n*Guangyun*\nOn the twenty-second day of the third month in the eighteenth year of Hongzhi.\n\n*Seal*\n\n*The Seventh Scroll of Imperial Favors Recorded in the Ming Dynasty Concludes*\n*The Eighth Scroll of Imperial Favors Recorded in the Ming Dynasty*\n*Zhang Yanling, the Forty-Eighth Generation Grand Perfected*\n\nBy imperial decree, he accompanied his father to court. The Emperor received him at the Qin’an Palace, commanded him to be seated, and bestowed upon him a banquet, a jade belt, and robes of brocade, along with an edict conferring the title of *Grand Perfected of the Great Dao, Inheritor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, Embracer of Emptiness and Primordial Stillness, Propagator of the Ancestral Teachings*—entrusting him with authority over the Daoist teachings throughout the realm.\n\nIn the third year of Zhengde, he was ordered to issue five hundred ordination certificates to tonsure Daoist adepts.\n\n**Edict for the Reconstruction of the Great Shangqing Palace**\n\nAn edict was issued to the eunuch director of the Directorate of Palace Attendants, Li Wen:\n\nThe Qing Palace on Mount Longhu has fallen into disrepair. The late Emperor had previously issued orders for its restoration, but due to local unrest, the project was never undertaken. Recently, Zhang Yantou, the *Grand Perfected Inheritor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings*, submitted a memorial requesting its reconstruction.\n\nWe now specially command you to proceed to the site and, together with the military and civil governors of Jiangxi and other officials, supervise the reconstruction in coordination with the Three Provincial Authorities (Defense, Administration, and Surveillance). All required materials and labor shall be allocated and prepared accordingly. The work must adhere to the original design, ensuring proper scale, durability, and structural integrity. Avoid delays and wasteful expenditure of funds.\n\nMoreover, as the people of Jiangxi face hardship and banditry remains unchecked, you must conduct yourself with integrity and impartiality, proceeding with caution and restraint. Strictly discipline your subordinates to prevent extortion or exploitation, lest the people’s grievances grow.\n\nShould you fail in this duty, accountability will be exacted. Take heed—take heed.\n\nTherefore, by Imperial Edict.\n\nOn the twelfth day of the sixth month in the third year of the *Guangyun* reign of *Zhengde* (1508), he was granted the Imperial Seal. In the seventh year (1512), he was ordered to participate in the sacrifices at the Altar of Earth. In the fifteenth year (1520), when the Emperor conducted his southern inspection, rumors arose of omens at the rear lake of Niu Shou Mountain. Summoned to the imperial encampment, he was commanded to dispel them and escorted the Emperor’s return to the capital.\n\nIn the first year of *Jiajing* (1522), he was summoned for an audience. When asked, he replied with the principle of \"purifying the heart and reducing desires,\" which pleased the Emperor. He was specially permitted to return to his mountain retreat and requested the *Tai Shang Yan Xi* registers of various ranks to present to the throne.\n\nIn the third year (1524), he was betrothed to the daughter of Marquis An Yuan, Liu Wen, as his second wife. The Emperor ordered the officials of the capital’s internal and external defenses to accompany him for the wedding procession.\n\nIn the fifth year (1526), he was elevated to the rank of *Grand Perfected* by imperial decree:\n\n*\"By the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor proclaims:*\nWe inherit the auspicious mandate and reverently follow the established statutes. As the spread of governance and transformation is vast, so too must the Daoist tradition not be abandoned. You, Zhang Yan Shun, *Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, Inheritor of the Teachings of Emptiness and Tranquility, Continuer of the Ancestral Transformation*, descend from the fiery Han and trace your Dao to the wisdom of Zhou. You have received the talismans and registers through true transmission, and your cultivation aligns with the essentials of refinement and nurturance. Mindful of your long service and diligent devotion, We commend your meritorious efforts, for your prayers and exorcisms have proven efficacious.\n\nThus, We specially confer upon you the title: *Grand Perfected Who Embraces the Mysterious, Upholds the True, Nurtures Simplicity, Guards Silence, Preserves Radiance, Treads Harmony, Embodies Emptiness, and Inherits the Ancestral Transformation*. You shall oversee the affairs of Daoism throughout the realm and are granted this decree of investiture.\n\nYou must uphold the teachings of purity and emptiness to further invigorate the Daoist winds, and expand your heart of beneficence to enhance the glory of imperial transformation. May you forever safeguard abundant fortune and bestow blessings upon all beings.\n\nRespect this decree!\"*\n\nOn the third day of the second month in the fifth year of the Jiajing reign, by the Imperial Seal, an edict of further investiture:\n\nWe hereby specially confer upon the *Grand Perfected Zhang Yanxun, Successor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings*, the additional title: *Grand Perfected Who Embraces the Mysterious, Upholds the True, Nurtures Simplicity, Guards Silence, Preserves Radiance, Treads Harmony, Embraces Emptiness, and Inherits the Ancestral Transformation*. You shall oversee the affairs of Daoism throughout the realm and are granted this decree of investiture as your honor.\n\nThe Daoist priests of the Supreme Clarity Abbey, Fu Deyan and Shao Qinan, are appointed as assistants to the Grand Perfected’s Residence. Yu Yongshou and Zhan Wangkui are appointed as scribes, each to assume their duties and manage affairs accordingly.\n\nYou must reverently obey Our command, strictly adhere to the pure regulations, and pray for enduring fortune and blessings. Furthermore, you shall supervise all officials, ensuring their diligence and attentiveness in service, so as to prevent negligence or dereliction, thereby fulfilling the intent of esteemed reverence. Respect this decree!\n\nBy the Imperial Mandate.\n*Broad Fortune*\nOn the fifteenth day of the second month in the fifth year of the Jiajing reign, by the Imperial Seal.\n\nA special edict to the *Grand Perfected Zhang Yanxun, Successor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings*:\n\nWe now command you to proceed to the blessed land of the Mysterious Heaven, where you shall conduct rites of purification and offer a grand jiao ceremony—one for the great foundation of the state, and one to pray for the people’s welfare.\n\nYou must devote your undivided heart to this task with reverence and utmost sincerity. Particularly, you shall supervise your subordinates and the officials dispatched from the princely residence, ensuring that any occupied land is appropriately assessed and restored to its original state. Respect this decree!\n\nBy Our solemn consideration,\nYou must proceed with utmost care and diligence, never neglecting your duty. Thus may you fulfill Our deepest intent and bring glory to the teachings. Respect this decree!\n\n*Broad Fortune*\nOn the sixteenth day of the second month in the fifth year of the Jiajing reign, by the Imperial Seal.\n\n**Edict for the Reconstruction of the Grand Perfected’s Residence**\n\nA special edict to Wu You, Left Vice-Director of the Directorate of Palace Attendants:\n\nRecently, the *Grand Perfected Zhang Yanxun, Successor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings*, memorialized that his residence had fallen into disrepair and requested the dispatch of officials to oversee its reconstruction.\n\nWe now command you to proceed to the site and supervise the construction in accordance with the prescribed design. The work must be expedited. Funds and provisions shall be arranged by the local grand coordinator, regional inspector, and the Three Provincial Administrations. Laborers shall be requisitioned from neighboring prefectures and counties and dispatched to the site.\n\nYou must calculate materials and labor with precision, ensuring the structure is built to proper standards and with enduring solidity. Above all, you shall uphold impartiality and integrity, maintaining order and showing compassion to artisans, soldiers, and laborers alike. Let them rest and work in due measure, so that all may perform their duties with contentment.\n\nYou are strictly forbidden from exploiting the occasion to impose burdens, lest the people voice grievances. Should you violate this command, accountability shall be enforced. Act accordingly in all matters.\n\nThus is the edict.\n\nIn the fifth year of the *Guangyun* reign of Jiajing, on the third day of the third month, under the Imperial Seal.\n\nIn the fifth month of this year, by imperial command, divine statues and bestowed seals were decreed. Eunuch Bao Zhong of the Directorate of Ceremonial, transmitting the sacred edict, ordered that the received statues of the Three Pure Ones, the Four Emperors, and the stellar deities be entrusted to Wu Youzi for conveyance to the Palace of the Great Perfected Ones at Mount Longhu and the Altar of the Ten Thousand Dharma Sects at Mount Hu, there to be enshrined and worshipped.\n\nFurther bestowed were one silver seal engraved with the title *\"Master of the Palm of the Dharma, Immortal Minister\"* and one ivory seal carved with the title *\"Heir to the Sectarian Transmission.\"* Thus is the decree.\n\nThe Ministry of Revenue was instructed to investigate and recover the fields and grain taxes of the Supreme Clarity Palace that had been usurped by powerful commoners, with orders to enforce prohibitions and provide protection.\n\nThis year, the August Emperor of the Primordial Yang personally inscribed a response before the curtain of the Perfected Master’s tent. Since the second month, the Master has returned and conducted a grand offering at Mount Wudang.\n\nNo word had been received for some time, but on the eighteenth day of the eighth month, a letter from the Master was delivered via the Perfected One Yi Zhenren. It was learned that the Master had endured long travels and the hardships of the summer heat en route.\n\nUpon reviewing the letter again, it was further understood that the Master had interceded on behalf of a criminal, Chen, seeking clemency for his offenses. This matter is well known to Us. The Master may cultivate harmony in accordance with the seasons to welcome the vital qi.\n\nThe great work of expounding the profound mysteries and magnifying the esoteric principles that benefit the state truly aligns with Heaven and safeguards Our imperial enterprise, ensuring its perpetuity through myriad generations.\n\nWe, too, revere Heaven with reverence and embody the Dao with virtue, striving to govern with proper teachings.\n\nMoreover, should any places within the palaces and temples of Mount Wudang yield scriptures on the supreme principles, alchemical registers, Dharma texts, or sacred objects, the Master is to diligently seek them out, fulfilling Our sincere devotion to the Dao.\n\nNow, as the envoy returns, this reply is sent. Let the Master take note.\n\nWritten on the fourth day after the Mid-Autumn Festival in the fifth year of Jiajing.\n\n[Sixth year.]\n\nThe Celestial Lord of Primordial Yang writes in response:\n\nLast year, We dispatched the Master to personally journey to the blessed realm of the Ancestral Master of Myriad Methods, where you conducted rites to pacify the spirits and performed the Jiao offering. At the Jing Le Palace, you also established the Qi Si fast for the prayer of heirs. Your sacred form has labored deeply, and We have been mindful of your well-being.\n\nYet only recently—on the final day of the seventh month—did Zuo Zhi Ling arrive in the capital, bearing word that you had completed the Jiao rites and returned to your abode. Subsequently, the emissaries Zhang Xian and others reached the capital in the ninth month, presenting the rare treasures and numinous objects from the blessed realm, which We have reverently received.\n\nNow, as the envoy returns, We specially command this missive to be conveyed with utmost sincerity in reply. Furthermore, regarding the construction of the ritual altar and the official residence, the local officials have been negligent and destructive, defying Our decree and flouting the Dharma’s statutes. We have now ordered the work to proceed with all haste, and a report is to be submitted upon completion. May the Master temporarily condescend to remain with the immortal retinue until the project’s completion, after which you may return to your former residence. Let the Master take note of Our esteem.\n\nWritten on an auspicious day in the ninth month of the sixth year of Jiajing.\n\n[Seventh year. Appointed to accompany the sacrifices at the Altar of the Stars.\nEleventh year. Imperial decree for the restoration of the Great Supreme Clarity Palace.]\n\nDecree to Cao Yu, Left Supervisor of the Directorate of Palace Attendants:\n\nThe halls and pavilions of the Supreme Clarity Palace on Dragon-Tiger Mountain in Jiangxi have suffered damage from long years of neglect. Proceed with all haste to repair and restore them to completion. As for the construction of the Immortal Source Palace in accordance with the previously issued plans, ensure that the foundations are firmly laid, the beams and pillars robustly built, and the structures made to endure for all time, so as to worthily reflect Our utmost reverence in serving the divine.\n\nWe now specially appoint you to proceed there and, together with the local grand coordinator and governor, supervise the relevant prefectural and departmental officials in carrying out the repairs and construction in accordance with past precedents. All required materials, labor, artisans, and funds shall be managed in strict accordance with the principles approved by the Ministry. You must oversee the project with meticulous care and arrange all matters appropriately.\n\nAs an inner court official entrusted with this commission, you must above all uphold integrity and impartiality, conduct yourself with composure, and treat the artisans and laborers with compassion. Ensure they are fed and rested at proper times, that their burdens and respite are fairly balanced, and that they work willingly—this shall be the measure of your competence. You are not to tolerate laxity, extort or harass the workers, seize their labor unlawfully, or make unreasonable demands, lest you provoke resentment and incur guilt.\n\nUpon completion, submit a register detailing the halls and pavilions repaired, along with an account of all expenditures. You must exercise the utmost caution in this matter.\n\nThus decreed.\n\nOn the seventh day of the third month in the eleventh year of the Jiajing reign, under the Great Seal of the Vast Realm:\n\nIn the fourteenth year, in accordance with the former precedent, the households of the Orthodox Unity Daoist lineage were exempted from universal corvée service. The Ministry of Revenue, reverently receiving the imperial decree, declared: \"The Grand Zhengyi Perfected, not being of recent appointment, has already been granted the grace of Our August Ancestor’s edict, and all his memorials shall be approved. Local officials must not treat him with disrespect or negligence. You ministers, knowing only to sell your public duty, have failed even to investigate—this is now expressly commanded to be thoroughly rectified.\"\n\nIn the sixteenth year, an imperial decree was issued to interrogate officials along the route for disobedience and neglect:\nThe imperial decree stated: \"Zhang Yanbin, as the overseer of Daoist teachings, journeyed to the capital to offer congratulations. Repeated edicts from the former court mandated that local officials along the route provide requisite supplies. Yet the officials in these jurisdictions have failed to disburse them. Let the investigating censor summon and question the regional inspectors, who have likewise neglected to investigate. Henceforth, strict admonitions must be issued: military garrisons and civil authorities shall uniformly provide for his needs without delay or obstruction. Let the relevant offices take note.\"\n\nIn the same year, an order was issued to perform prayers for snow within the inner court. The Grand Zhengyi Perfected was bestowed with a golden coronet, a jade belt, ritual implements, silver, and silk.\n\nIn the seventeenth year, first month, an edict was issued to establish the Grand Golden Register Daoist Ritual at the Inner Imperial Altar, with augmented rewards and bestowals. An imperial mandate was further decreed to all en route authorities to provide supplies as per precedent for the *Celestial Master of Orthodox Unity, Successor to the Daoist Teachings, Embracer of Mystery, Preserver of Authenticity, Cultivator of Simplicity, Guardian of Silence, Nurturer of Radiance, Treader of Harmony, Attainer of Emptiness, and Abider in Serenity, who Upholds the Daoist Teachings of All Under Heaven*—Zhang Yanbin.\n\nUpon receiving your memorial, wherein you stated that, in accordance with the triennial audience custom, you encountered en route officials who refused to furnish supplies as mandated, thereby obstructing your journey and causing you to miss the appointed time for the court audience. Though a clear edict was previously issued, it has once more been disregarded. Thus, this edict is now dispatched to safeguard your passage: for all matters pertaining to your journey to the capital—whether for audience or other purposes—all military garrisons, civil authorities, postal relay stations, and other relevant offices along your route shall uniformly provide supplies in accordance with precedent, without delay or obstruction. Should any dare to repeat their former negligence, you are permitted to report their misconduct in detail for investigation and punishment. Let this command be reverently obeyed. Hence the edict.\n\nOn the fourth day of the second month in the seventeenth year of the Jiajing reign under the Great Mandate,\n\nBy this edict, the *Zhengyi* Grand Perfected Zhang Yanqing is commanded to proceed to Mount Qiyun for the performance of a jiao offering.\n\nIn former years, the Perfected Li Decai was once dispatched to Mount Qiyun to conduct a jiao ritual at the shrine of the Northern Ultimate True Martial Divinity, and the response was indeed efficacious. Now, We specially command you to journey there and reverently perform the fast and jiao rites, both to offer thanks to the deity and to supplicate for the longevity of Our Mother.\n\nUpon completion of the rites, you shall return to your mountain. The eminent scholar Nie Yiran, who accompanies you, is to report back on your journey. All military garrisons, civil authorities, postal relay stations, and other relevant offices along your route shall uniformly provide supplies in accordance with precedent, without delay, obstruction, or disrespect. Should any dare to disregard this edict and repeat their former negligence, you are permitted to report their misconduct in detail for investigation and punishment.\n\nHence the edict.\n\nSealed on the nineteenth day of the second month in the seventeenth year of the Jiajing reign under the Great Mandate.\n\nIn the eighteenth year, upon petition, Mount Qiyun was granted the same exemptions as Mount Taihe: the official road was removed, and the abbot and administrators were confirmed. The divine palace was named *Xuantian Taisu Gong*. The mountain’s incense tax was also exempted from remittance to the capital, and an edict was issued for its protection.\n\n---\n\nA handwritten letter of mourning upon the ascension of the Holy Mother:\n\nTo the *Xiangyi* Emperor, written and respectfully presented to the residence of the *Zhengyi* Lineage Successor, Perfected Zhang,\n\nI have long accumulated transgressions and have now personally suffered the loss of my compassionate parent on the fourth day of the twelfth month in the *wuxu* year. My five viscera are torn asunder. Moreover, at Nanhua, I personally oversaw the burial site—how could my grief not be redoubled? My mother’s years had not yet reached their full span, and her illnesses lingered for years, day following night, night following day. I had hoped for her recovery, yet how could I have foreseen that the Two Saints would both abandon me? Alas!\n\nI briefly set down my suffering to convey my sorrow. The rest need not be elaborated; I trust you will understand.\n\nWritten on an auspicious day in the first month of autumn in the eighteenth year of the Jiajing reign,\nXiangyi bows.\n\n**Record of Congratulations on the Birth of a Son**\n\nPerfected Xiangyi addresses the Supreme Master of Orthodox Unity,\n\nLast month, I learned that Heaven had bestowed its favor upon your lineage, and the Dao’s succession had opened its source—my joy knows no bounds. Day and night, you must carefully tend to the child. I now dispatch this messenger with gifts to offer congratulations; pray accept them. The rest need not be elaborated.\n\nWritten on an auspicious day in the last month of winter in the *jihai* year,\nYuanyang Hanji bows.\n\n---\n\n**Imperial Edict Temporarily Exempting from Court Audience**\n\nIn the nineteenth year [of the Jiajing reign], an imperial edict was issued to Zhang Yanxi, Great Perfected and Successor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings:\n\nWe recall the system established by Our Imperial Ancestor, whereby all officials of the empire’s great and minor guard gates, without exception, are to present themselves at court once every three years. You, too, are included in this, out of respect for your teachings. This year marks the appointed time, yet We consider that you have only recently been blessed with a son in middle age, and he remains in swaddling clothes—separation at such a distance may prove difficult. Thus, We specially dispatch the emissary Huang Rugui to convey this decree, exempting you from this occasion’s attendance. May you devote yourself wholly to his care, and perceive Our intent to safeguard your heir. You shall reverently comply.\n\nBy Imperial Command.\n\nOn the fifth day of the fifth month in the nineteenth year of the Jiajing reign, [Imperial Seal]—In the twenty-first year, Imperial Patent Conferring the Title of *Xuanjun* upon the Ladies Zhu and Song.\n\nBy the Grace of Heaven and the Mandate of the Emperor, We decree:\n\nThe labor of a mother in raising her child is equal to that of instruction, just as a ruler, in relation to his ministers, must fulfill their wish for honor and recognition. When matters pertain to the cultivation of moral influence, how can favor be bound by ordinary measures?\n\nYou, Lady Zhu, were the daughter of the late Grand Preceptor and Grand Tutor to the Heir Apparent, the Duke of Chengguo, Yi, and are the lawful mother of Zhang Yanxi, Successor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, Grand Perfected, and Overseer of Daoist Affairs throughout the empire. From a family of meritorious service, you nurtured refinement; from an official lineage, you spread fragrance. In conduct, you were frugal and diligent; in nature, gentle yet upright. You assisted your husband in attaining the subtleties of the Pure and Subtle, and instructed your son in the sincerity of the Mysterious and Plain. The state relied upon you for blessings, and the Daoist teachings flourished through your virtue. Thus, We extend this noble instruction and bestow upon you an imperial patent, hereby conferring the posthumous title of *Duanrou Shunde Xuanjun* (\"Upright, Gentle, Obedient, and Virtuous Mysterious Lady\"). May this radiant honor illuminate the Nine Springs, and may your illustrious name endure for a hundred generations.\n\nDecree:\n\nThe son’s prosperity is rooted in his mother’s virtue, and the mother’s honor arises from her son’s distinction. In consideration of this minister of the Mysterious Teachings, how could We withhold a command of praise and favor?\n\nYou, Lady Song, were the daughter of Qing, Commandant of the Embroidered Uniform Guard, and are the birth mother of Zhang Yantou, Successor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, Grand Perfected, and Overseer of Daoist Affairs throughout the empire. From a family of eminent officials, your name graced the rolls of the noble. By nature gentle and yielding, you embodied the virtues of frugality and diligence; in bearing, upright and circumspect, you exemplified the winds of purity and tranquility. Weighing your merits, We fittingly grant this honor and bestowal. Hereby, We specially confer upon you the title of *Rouci Chongshan Xuanjun* (\"Gentle, Compassionate, Reverent, and Good Mysterious Lady\") with this imperial patent. May you, in receiving this exalted grace, forever illuminate the netherworld.\n\nBy Imperial Patent.\nOn the ninth day of the third month in the twenty-first year of the Jiajing reign.\n\nBy the Treasure of the Realm, Imperial Patent Conferring the Title of *Xuanjun* upon Ladies Li, Wu, and Liu:\n\nIn accordance with Heaven’s Mandate, the Emperor decrees:\nRewards of honor are bestowed to requite worthy toil; favors of grace must indeed commend virtue and gentleness—such is the illustrious canon of the court.\n\nLady Li, wife of Zhang Yanxu, Successor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, Grand Perfected, and Overseer of Daoist Affairs throughout the empire, is the daughter of the Earl of Xiangcheng. Born of a meritorious house, she early entered the Daoist lineage, faithfully cultivating the wifely Way. Her diligence won her a reputation for virtue. In recognition of her exceptional merit and in deference to her husband’s petition, We hereby specially confer upon her the title of *Chongxu Rouhui Xuanjun* (\"Serene, Vacant, Gentle, and Gracious Mysterious Lady\") with this imperial patent. May she reverently receive this singular grace and illuminate her hidden chamber.\n\nDecree:\nWhen a minister serves his lord with sincerity, the honors bestowed should be abundant. When a wife follows her husband in righteousness, the favors granted must be equitable. For what bears upon the transformation of customs knows no distinction between the living and the departed.\n\nLady Wu, second wife of Zhang Yanpian, Successor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, Grand Perfected, and Overseer of Daoist Affairs throughout the empire, is the daughter of Zhen, Commander of the Brocade Guard. Early did she receive the tutelage of her governess and become the consort of a noble house. Her conduct was virtuous and circumspect, her demeanor gentle and exemplary. In her subtle service to the Daoist teachings\n\nOn the ninth day of the third month in the twenty-first year of the Jiajing reign, the imperial seal was affixed. In this year, the Ministry was commanded to issue five hundred ordination certificates for Daoist priests. An edict was dispatched to the Governor of Jiangxi, prohibiting the people of Fuzhou from privately forging spurious registers.\n\nIn the twenty-second year, a second exemption from court attendance was granted.\n**Imperial Edict:**\nThe Emperor decrees and instructs Zhang Yanpian, Successor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings and Grand Perfected:\nWe recall the system established by Our imperial ancestor, whereby all officials of high and low rank throughout the empire were required to attend court once every three years. You, too, were included in this system, for you are the heir to a sacred teaching, and thus We hold you in particular esteem. In the previous cycle, We exempted you from attendance out of consideration for your young son. Now, as the time has again come, your son remains too young to be left behind. We therefore dispatch Qiao Jian, a Hundred-Household Officer of the Brocade Guard, to convey Our decree, granting you another temporary exemption from court attendance. This is so that you may devote yourself to your duties and perceive Our intent to safeguard and cherish your heir. You shall reverently comply with this command.\n**Decree issued.**\nOn the fifteenth day of the fifth month in the twenty-second year of the Jiajing reign, the imperial seal was affixed.\n\nIn the twenty-eighth year, he was summoned to court with his heir. Upon their arrival at the capital gates, the Emperor sent the eunuch Gao Zhong to convey words of comfort and consolation, bestowing upon the heir robes and a sash. The following day, they were received in audience, and a banquet was held in the side hall of the palace. He was commanded to compile and present the names of all previous Grand Perfected for the Emperor’s perusal. The Emperor personally brushed an imperial inscription, granting the heir the name *Yongxu*. His petition for retirement was approved, and *Yongxu* was permitted to succeed to the teachings and inherit the title.\n\nIn the thirty-ninth year, he was specially granted the funerary rites and sacrifices accorded to marquises, along with an imperial mandate.\n\nImperial Edict: We had intended to dispatch an official in the second month to summon the Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity, that he might attend to his father. Yet in the mid-winter of last year, his father passed away. In accordance with the rites accorded to marquises, he shall be granted funeral funds, sacrificial grain, and one hundred *shi* of hemp cloth, along with thirteen altars of offerings. An order shall be issued to the relevant offices for immediate compliance. A *qianhu* and a *xingren* shall be dispatched to convey Our decree, exempting the heir, the Perfected Successor, from appearing at court, and to oversee the proper conduct of the funeral rites. Let the Ministry be informed.\n\nA decree was issued, sending *Xingren* Li Qi of the Bureau of Transmission to offer sacrifices and eulogies, accompanied by *Qianhu* Wang Zhengyi of the Embroidered Uniform Guard to supervise the funeral rites. Twenty guardsmen were assigned to investigate any negligence or disrespect among the officials and servants. The Ministry was instructed to proceed according to protocol, and the burial site was relocated from the Shudian Academy in Yiyang County to the hills of Shudie Mountain.\n\nThe text of the thirteen altars of sacrificial eulogies:\n\nOn the ___ day of the ___ month, the forty-first year of the Jiajing reign, the Emperor dispatched *Xingren* Li of the Bureau of Transmission to offer sacrifices and eulogies to Zhang Yantou, Successor to the Teachings and Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity:\n\nYou received the grace of Our state and succeeded to the leadership of the Daoist teachings. Abiding in profound stillness, you nurtured your nature in emptiness and tranquility. You prayed for the people’s well-being and labored with manifest merit. Your timely audiences were noted in Our heart. We esteemed your lofty conduct and repeatedly bestowed favors upon you. It was fitting that you should enjoy long blessings, yet illness brought your end. The news of your passing has reached Us, and We are truly grieved.\n\nWe have specially augmented the rites of consolation, sending officials to offer sacrifices and ordering the local authorities to prepare your burial site. May your spirit, undimmed, receive this decree with reverence.\n\nEulogy for the first seven-day period and the seventh seven-day period:\nYou concentrated on the mysterious and maintained stillness, inheriting your ancestor’s virtue.

Upon reaching the capital gates, the Emperor dispatched the eunuch Gao Zhong to convey imperial consolation and bestow gifts: a ceremonial robe and a jade belt, which he was commanded to wear. The following day, he was received in audience within the inner palace, where a banquet was held in the side hall. He was permitted to inherit the teachings and succeed to the title, though temporarily exempted from court attendance.\n\n*Imperial Edict*\nThe Emperor decrees:\nThe Grand Perfected and Successor of the Orthodox Unity Teachings, Zhang Yongxu, was due to attend court in the twenty-ninth year of Jiajing, as per the customary audience cycle.

As the successor is able to inherit the true transmission, so the court ought to renew its conferral of mandate.\n\nYour ancestor, Zhang Yongxu, in the era of the Flaming Han, propagated the Mystic Mechanism. Through successive generations, he was revered as a teacher and model. When Our imperial ancestor ascended the throne, in recognition of his meritorious prayers and protections for the state, he was granted the hereditary title of Grand Perfected.\n\nYou, endowed with intelligence and born with clarity, have upheld the ancestral legacy and inherited the forebears’ blessings. Thus, We now confer upon you the title of Grand Perfected of Orthodox Unity, Successor of the Teachings, Guardian of the Mysteries, Cultivator of Simplicity, Exemplar of the Dao, and Overseer of Daoist Affairs Under Heaven, along with this patent of appointment.\n\nYou shall ever more diligently uphold and guard these duties, redoubling your devotion to cultivation. Strive to ensure the flourishing of governance and the prosperity of the people, to secure peace and abundance for the populace. Thus shall the Mystic Blessing be made manifest, and the imperial realm be eternally preserved. Respect this decree.\n\nOn the sixteenth day of the fourth month in the twenty-ninth year of the Jiajing reign, the imperial seal was affixed. In this year, an edict was issued to betroth the daughter of Dingguo Duke Xu Yande as his consort. Chengguo Duke Zhu Zhizhong and Sui’an Earl Chen Lian were commanded to deliberate and perform the marriage rites.\n\nIn the thirty-first year, he was summoned to court and granted an imperial banquet in the inner palace. A decree was issued through the Directorate of Ceremonial, transmitted by Eunuch Huang Jin: \"The Grand Perfected of Orthodox Unity, Successor of the Teachings, Zhang Yongxu, shall be bestowed with the ceremonial robes of an Earl for court audiences and sacrifices, along with their regular use. Respect this decree.\" The Ministry of Rites, in compliance, memorialized the throne and directed the Ministry of Works to craft the following: one set of red silk court robes, a complete set of red silk court attire with jade and leather belt, a full set of blue silk sacrificial robes, one crimson *fensi* robe, one blue *fensi* robe, one gold crown, one jade belt, and one ivory tablet, to be delivered for his use.\n\nIn the first month of the thirty-second year, by imperial grace, the marriage was solemnized. After a month, an official was dispatched to escort him back to his residence. An edict was issued: \"Though the Grand Perfected Zhang has prior precedents for his return, this time, by special decree, an official has been sent to accompany him back. Why have provisions been reduced by more than half? Let the previous standard be restored, with an additional quarter granted. No delays or disobedience shall be tolerated. The relevant ministry is to take note.\"\n\nIn this year, the throne disbursed a quantity of silver ingots from the imperial treasury, specially dispatching Zhao Hu, a *Qianhu* of the Embroidered Uniform Guard, to fund the reconstruction of the Zhengyi, Jingying, and Xiangfu Abbeys.\n\nIn the thirty-seventh year, an imperial gift of a sacred statue from Xiangshan was bestowed, to be enshrined and worshipped at the Altar of the Ten Thousand Dharma Methods. Approval was granted to confer the register of the Dao upon the Daoist Jin Yuanqing, appointing him as Left Administrator of Orthodox Unity and filling the vacancy of *Tidian* at the Primordial Palace of Purple Heaven on Mount Qiyun.

The documents of protection shall be issued to the local authorities, who are forbidden to treat them with contempt. Respect this.\n\nOfficials of all local authorities are forbidden to slight or disdain the decree.\n\nImperial Edict: The officials of all local authorities—We hold the teachings of the Mysterious Origin in the highest regard, for their legacy is most venerable. The Great Perfected Zhang Yongxu, thirty-ninth successor of the Orthodox Unity lineage, has inherited from his ancestors the propagation of the Daoist teachings, offering prayers for the state and benefiting the people. In obscurity, he has harmonized with the imperial order, and over the years, his mysterious merits have grown ever more manifest. Thus, We have elevated his rank and bestowed upon him exceptional courtesies to demonstrate Our profound favor.\n\nNow that the Perfected has returned from his audience at court, We specially issue this edict to instruct: aside from the miscellaneous corvée and material expenses, which shall be investigated and exempted as before, and the documents verified by the relevant ministry, vessels shall be provided in accordance with the new regulations and dispatched as per the old precedent. All local officials must comply with this edict and are forbidden to slight or disdain it. Should any dare to defy or act with contempt, they shall be severely punished without pardon. Let this be proclaimed.\n\nImperial Edict, bearing the seal of the twenty-ninth day of the first month in the thirty-eighth year of the Jiajing reign. In the forty-third year, the Emperor held court at the Western Park and summoned the Perfected, commanding him to pray for snow at the Chaotian Palace, and later to perform a jiao ritual in the inner palace. On the first day of the first month of the following year, at dawn, the Perfected preceded the ministers in entering the audience hall of the side palace, where he and the Grand Secretary Xu Jie, along with six other ministers, were jointly bestowed a banquet within the hall.\n\nIn the forty-fourth year, the imperial patent conferring the title of Yuanjun upon Lady Xu was issued:\n\nBy the grace of Heaven and the mandate of the Emperor, it is decreed: The state bestows favor upon the consorts of scholar-officials with ennobling decrees to honor their persons. Yet when one illustriously continues a true lineage and silently upholds the mysterious teachings, her virtue is all the more worthy of praise.\n\nThe late wife of the Grand Perfected Zhang Yongxu, Lady Xu, hailed from a family of meritorious ministers and was wed to the descendant of a lofty Perfected. From an early age, she was well-versed in the classics and histories, governing herself with dignity; she diligently studied the scriptural commentaries, ever maintaining a mind of equanimity. She bore a worthy heir to carry on the family legacy. Thus, We specially confer upon her the title of Tranquil Harmony Yuanjun and bestow upon her this patent of ennoblement.\n\nIn the Dao of household management, nothing precedes tranquility; in the methods of fostering clan harmony, nothing surpasses concord. As you have already won renown for your wifely virtue, We now expect you to fulfill your maternal duty without fail. May your blessings extend through generations, in repayment of the state’s grace.\n\nPatent issued on the ninth day of the ninth month in the forty-fourth year of the Jiajing reign.\n\nBy Our Imperial Edict, a Proclamation to Tranquil Harmony Yuanjun Lady Xu:\n\nThe court holds in the highest esteem the teachings of the Supreme Dao, having already propagated its orthodox transformation to seek blessings for the state and the people. It must therefore safeguard its descendants, that they may flourish and perpetuate their lineage. Now that the Grand Perfected One has passed and his son is yet young, We are deeply moved with compassion. We hereby specially confer upon you, Lady Xu, the title of Tranquil Harmony Yuanjun, entrusting you with the governance of internal affairs. Furthermore, We have selected four virtuous and prudent Daoist priests to serve as Assistants in Teaching and Scribes, aiding in the management of external matters.\n\nYou must devote particular care to the upbringing of your young son, nurturing and instructing him in due time, that he may not deviate from his inherited path and thus worthily uphold the grace of the state. All members of the clan and household who, relying on their seniority, numerical strength, or high standing, dare to bully, insult, or harm you—should the offense be minor, you may dispatch messengers to report it to the provincial and prefectural authorities for admonishment and disposition; should it be grave, you may submit a detailed memorial to Us for the apprehension and interrogation of the Assistants in Teaching and Scribes. Should any of them act unlawfully, you may likewise restrain and discipline them as described above.\n\nIf you wish to correct others, you must first correct yourself; if you wish the clan to refrain from bullying and insult, you must first foster harmony within it. Let this be your reverent duty.\n\nIssued by Imperial Command.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the ninth month in the forty-fourth year of the Jiajing reign, an edict bearing the imperial seal was issued, granting posthumous honors and consolation rites. The imperial decree read: \"The memorial and all matters concerning posthumous honors and consolation shall be reviewed by the Ministry of Rites in accordance with precedent. Respect this.\"\n\n**Edict for the Seven Altars of Sacrificial Rites**\nOn a certain day in the forty-fourth year of the Jiajing reign, the Emperor dispatched Envoy Yao Guangzhu of the Bureau of Ceremonial Commissioners to convey sacrificial rites to the Grand Perfected Zhang Yongxu, saying: \"You inherited the leadership of the Daoist teachings and prayed for the state’s blessings. Yet before reaching the prime of life, you were suddenly taken by fate. In grace and consolation, We continue to nurture your orphaned heir. This edict of sacrifice is specially bestowed, and your burial site shall be prepared. May your spirit, if not yet departed, receive this decree with reverence.\"\n\n**Edict for the First Seventh-Day Rite**\n\"It was you who inherited the teachings and prayed for blessings, yet you departed this world so soon. Now, on this first seventh-day, We bestow this sacrificial edict once more. If you are aware, receive it with gratitude.\"\n\n**Edicts for the Hundredth Day, Burial, First Anniversary, and Second Anniversary, with Purification Rites**\n\"Though you have passed, time has swiftly advanced. Now, on this appointed day, We dispatch these sacrificial rites. May your spirit, if not yet extinguished, partake of this profound grace.\"\n\n**Imperial Proclamation**\n\"The transmission of the Dao follows its lineage; the teachings flourish from the Primordial Beginning. Humanity is rooted in its ancestors, and rites of reverence are weighty in their veneration. You, Zhang Yandai, grandfather of Zhang Guoxiang, Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, who upheld sincerity in the Dao, expounded the mysteries, and propagated the teachings, emerged from the Mystic Gate and wandered beyond the mundane. Within your numinous abode, you nurtured true virtue, and your grandson now carries forth the ancestral legacy, silently aiding in the transformation of governance. In response to your grandson’s petition, We posthumously confer upon you the title of Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, who upheld sincerity and revered the model, that you may partake of the imperial favor and spread your illustrious radiance in the records of immortals.\"\n\n**Proclamation**\n\"The origin of the Daoist teachings lies in the Mystic Female; the prosperity of a grandson’s legacy begins in the inner chambers. You, Lady Yang, grandmother of Zhang Guoxiang, Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, who upheld sincerity in the Dao, expounded the mysteries, and propagated the teachings, were a woman of refined virtue from a noble family, wed to a descendant of immortals. Through two generations, you fostered auspicious omens and grandly continued the true lineage. We posthumously confer upon you the title of Serene and Virtuous Mystic Lady, that you may reverently receive the imperial decree and perpetuate your numinous legacy.\"\n\n**Imperial Patent**\nIssued on the fourteenth day of the third month in the thirtieth year of the Wanli reign.\n\n**Treasure of the Mandate**\n\nBy the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor proclaims:\nWe hold that nothing precedes loyalty and filial piety in the Dao, and no grace surpasses posthumous honor—this is the venerable canon of exalting roots. You, Zhang Yongshao, father of Zhang Guoxiang, Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, who upheld sincerity in the Dao, expounded the mysteries, propagated the teachings, and oversaw all Daoist affairs under Heaven, were born of immortal lineage, transcending early the dust and clamor of the world. Now, by virtue of your son’s petition for grace, We posthumously confer upon you the title of Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, Reverent Humility and Cultivated Simplicity, bestowing upon you this patent of proclamation to manifest this singular honor and adorn your numinous spirit.\n\n**Proclamation**\nThe ultimate origin of the Dao is named as the Mother. If one did not attain shared glory in life but receives extended grace thereafter, it is all the more fitting to commend virtue and broaden filial devotion. You, Lady Xia, wife of the posthumously enfeoffed Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, Reverent Humility and Cultivated Simplicity, Zhang Yongshao, and mother of Zhang Guoxiang, Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, who upheld sincerity in the Dao, expounded the mysteries, propagated the teachings, and oversees all Daoist affairs under Heaven, preserved your resolve through hardship and instructed your son in the transmission of the Mysteries. We now specially bestow upon you this patent, enfeoffing you as the Serene and Reverent Mystic Lady. May you ever more flourish in your cultivation, perpetuating your blessed lineage. Reverently receive this decree.\n\n**Imperial Patent**\n\nOn the first day of the fifth month in the twenty-third year of Wanli, the Imperial Seal was affixed.\n\nBy the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:\n\nWe reflect that in the governance of emperors and kings, all prayers for blessings, the presentation of sacred mysteries, the bestowal of fortune, and the guidance of the people—whereby the subtle workings of transformation and governance are harmonized—are invariably esteemed through the Daoist teachings. You, Zhang Guoxiang, having inherited the legacy for years and demonstrated efficacy in your supplications, have ever maintained a spirit of humility and withdrawal. By precedent, you are thus fitting to receive Our favor and commendation. We now specially enfeoff you as Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, who upholds sincerity in the Dao, expounds the mysteries, propagates the teachings, and oversees all Daoist affairs under Heaven, and bestow upon you this patent of enfeoffment. May you diligently cultivate and strengthen your resolve, fortify your practice, propagate the true wind to perfect your lineage, and manifest the profound transformation through generations, thereby aiding the fortunes of the realm and justifying this exalted honor. Reverently receive this decree.\n\nDecree:\n\nThe Daoist teachings illuminate the norms of human relations, and their shared glory is commensurate with enduring canons. When those of noble lineage and imperial consorts emulate the excellence of the Mystic Gate, their virtue is all the more worthy of praise. The wife of Zhang Guoxiang, Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, who upholds sincerity in the Dao, expounds the mysteries, propagates the teachings, and oversees all Daoist affairs under Heaven, Lady Xie, is the daughter of the former Minister of the Court of the Imperial Clan, Grand Guardian of the Heir Apparent, and Commandery Prince Consort of the Imperial Carriage, Xie Shao. She descends from the sister of Emperor Yi, and belongs to the lineage of the imperial consorts. She has cast aside worldly splendor, embracing simplicity, served her mother-in-law with filial devotion, and cultivated purity in her conduct. We now bestow upon her this patent, enfeoffing her as the Serene and Chaste Mystic Lady. Reverently receive this decree.\n\nMay you ever emulate this legacy in tranquil devotion, becoming a paragon of chaste virtue, thereby enhancing the model of the Dao and forever matching the imperial commendation. Reverently receive this decree.\n\nBy Imperial Edict\nPatent of Enfeoffment\nFirst day of the fifth month, thirty-third year of Wanli\nSeal of the Mandate\n\n*End of Volume Nine of the Imperial Ming Grace Record*",

      "translated_text": "In the wake of warfare, however, the public courts have seen many disruptions. Recently, we have heard that the regalia of office have been laid aside, and the Master’s presence has been far removed to rivers and lakes. Thus, in our earnest search, we hope for his swift return to his rightful residence. Now that the provincial and prefectural authorities have been appointed, an official shall be dispatched bearing incense to the ancestral altar of Longhu Mountain, there to reverently honor the Perfected Immortal and offer prayers for the prolongation of the Emperor’s sacred life.\n\nThis proclamation shall be publicly issued to inform all. The military commanders and civil officials are hereby enjoined to seek out the Celestial Master with all due diligence, extending every courtesy to invite him back to the mountain, that he may resume his former role as overseer of the Daoist teachings. All who belong to the temples, halls, and monasteries of Longhu Mountain—along with their ritual implements and sacred vessels—must not be desecrated or damaged, nor may the divine spirits be profaned. The former holdings of mountain gardens, fields, and dwellings shall remain under the Master’s authority, and no military or civilian personnel may seize or occupy them. Violators shall be punished.\n\nThis proclamation is hereby issued.\nGiven on the ___ day of the ___ month, in the sixth year of the Longfeng era.\n\n---\n\nIn the fourth month of this year, [the Emperor] wrote *Stilling the Mind and Stabilizing the Nature to Concentrate Daoist Cultivation*, addressed to the Master of the Mysterious Altar, the Forty-Second Celestial Master, Perfected Zhang. On the sixth day of the fifth month, Perfected Yu arrived, bearing the imperial letter along with offerings of rare incense and plain silk, the sincerity of which was profound—sufficient to attest to the splendor of this sacred mountain’s cultural legacy.\n\nWe have heard that the Han Ancestral Celestial Master embodied virtue and power, his every movement aided by spirits. With but a single exhalation or inhalation, the heavens would darken, and the gods of thunder and lightning would all receive his command. Thus did he assist the state and succor the people, dispelling malevolent forces and averting floods and droughts. For this reason, his numinous renown has grown ever more illustrious through more than forty generations.\n\nNow that Our Master has ascended to his ancestral position, he must carry forward his forebear’s achievements—achievements that no other arts can equal. We hope that the Master will still his mind and stabilize his nature to concentrate his Daoist cultivation, thereby amplifying the traces of his predecessors’ numinous efficacy. In this way, the mountain of Longhu shall rise ever higher in esteem, and the people’s reverence shall deepen.\n\nIn this summer season, We trust that your Daoist constitution remains in peace. May you cherish yourself a thousandfold, ten thousandfold.\n\nIn the year *yisi*, [the Emperor] summoned [the Celestial Master] to an audience, commanded him to be seated, and bestowed a banquet upon him.\n\n---\n\n**Decree of Praise for the Celestial Master**\nBy the command of the Prince of Wu:\nAmidst heaven and earth, the myriad beings are not equal, and their lives are boundless—yet none is more spiritually endowed than humankind. However, the birth of sages and worthies is extraordinary, for they are descended from the most refined *qi* of heaven and earth. This is the common lot of the wise and sagely across the ages. Some are granted exceptional abilities by heaven, as if heaven itself bestows them upon humanity. Thus do they become emperors or kings, generals or ministers. In the case of Buddhism and Daoism, they become buddhas or immortals. Though they may be born of heaven and earth’s purest *qi*, their distinctions arise from heaven’s conferral of ability, and so their ranks differ.\n\nWe have heard that the Han Ancestral Celestial Master was born extraordinary: his brows towered, his beard bristled, and his eyes flashed like shooting stars or lightning, his divine majesty a thousandfold greater [than ordinary men]. Beginning in western Shu, he journeyed to Longhu Mountain, where he commanded spirits and established the Mysterious Altar. Yet his abilities were not merely for his own cultivation; they truly benefited the state and its people. From that time onward, he warded off great calamities, averted disasters, and illuminated the spirits of the three realms. His lineage has been passed down through successive generations, each of which has honored him. Why? Because the Celestial Master’s numinous efficacy brings benefit.\n\nSince We emerged from obscurity, the realm has undergone upheaval, and We have been revered by the multitudes. We dare not but exert Our utmost sincerity to pacify the people. Whenever We hear of the Celestial Master, We long to meet him. How joyous it is to behold him at last! His eyes flash like lightning, and his dignified bearing is that of a master of the dharma. Though he does not serve in an official capacity at court, to share this era with him is a once-in-a-millennium encounter—how could it not be wondrous?\n\nYet the mysteries of Buddhism and Daoism run deep, and they hold profound meaning. The foolish do not comprehend them, while those who do must not stray. To honor them brings blessings; to transgress brings misfortune. Thus do fortune and ruin wax and wane.\n\nDelighted by the Celestial Master’s dharma-bearing countenance, which resembles that of his ancestors, We hereby bestow these gifts.\n\n[The Emperor] summoned him again for an audience, bestowed a banquet and gifts of gold and silk, and permitted him to return to the mountain.\n\nIn the year *bingwu*, [the Emperor] issued a decree commanding the widespread distribution of talismanic water.",

This is a concern for the Master.\n\nWould it not be better to grant talismans only to those with afflictions and withhold them from those without? Yet We are uncertain whether this approach is proper. It would be fitting to convene with the various dharma masters to deliberate, then widely distribute talismanic water, thereby concealing its wondrous workings and honoring the numinous spirit of the mountain.\n\nWe have heard that those afflicted by pestilence who drank from the well’s talismanic water recovered, and Our sagely mind rejoices in this.

      "translated_text": "On the eighth day of the second month in the Dingwei year of the Haonian era, a decree was issued to select a master of refined Daoist arts to present a missive at court. The King of Hao penned a letter to the Master of the Mysterious Altar, Celestial Master Zhang of Mount Longhu.\n\nRecently, since the first month, We have been preoccupied with matters of state, yet what weighs upon Our heart is the desire to memorialize the Supreme Emperor. However, with no one to bear the petition to the Celestial Court, We have dispatched an envoy to the Celestial Master’s gate. We trust that, by the numinous power of your ancestors, you will surely act with utmost sincerity, sending a master well-versed in the wondrous arts of the Dao to bear the petition to Heaven, thereby expressing Our prayers. This would indeed reflect your reverent intent. Upon receipt of this letter, We hope you will promptly send forth a capable master. No further elaboration is needed.\n\nIn the fifth month of the first year of the Hongwu era, upon ascending the imperial throne, the Emperor held a banquet in the side hall. Turning to address the assembly, the Emperor proclaimed: “We hereby bestow upon you the title of Grand Perfected. The Ministry of Rites shall deliberate and grant you an official stipend.” The Celestial Master then respectfully declined the salary, requesting instead to continue issuing talismans and registers as before. In recognition of this, the Emperor exempted all households under his jurisdiction, as well as the various corvée services of the Great Shangqing Palace, establishing this as a permanent precedent. A silver seal was conferred, ranking him equivalent to a principal second-grade official, with the appointment of assistant instructors, scribes, and administrative aides.\n\n**Imperial Edict Conferring the Title of Grand Perfected upon the Forty-Second Generation Celestial Master**\n\nBy the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:\n\nWe reflect upon the true essence of the Mysterious Teachings, which expounds the canon of over five thousand words. The ancestral sanctuary has accumulated blessings, transmitting its lineage through forty-two generations. The land’s numen has nurtured the dragon-tiger’s elite, and the immortal’s bones have been refined into the semblance of crane and phoenix. You preside over the Orthodox Unity teachings, aiding Our Great Ming.\n\nCelestial Master Zhang Zhengchang, of simple and upright nature, embodies steadfast integrity. Heaven has endowed him with the sacred scriptures and precious talismans. He delves into the profound mysteries amid the pearls and grains, riding jade palanquins and jasper wheels to transcend the void and soar above the clouds. With sword in hand, ghosts and spirits obey his commands; ascending the altar, thunder and rain respond to his call. Truly, he is a master of both Heaven and humanity, a scion of divine luminosity.\n\nYet virtue is not constrained by titles and ranks, and temperament prizes the cultivation of harmony. In recent times, the conferral of eminent official positions, though seemingly honorable, does not align with the highest principles. Thus, We bestow the noble title of Grand Perfected, elevating him above all Daoist adepts of the age, his name resounding across the realm as the master of the ancestral altar.\n\nWe seek to convey Our sincerity to the Nine Heavens, and you shall employ your spiritual power to fulfill this. We aim to govern the Four Seas, and you shall aid this with your purity and tranquility. May you abundantly receive the primal qi, eternally securing blessings and prosperity.\n\nLet it be decreed: Zhang Zhengchang, Master of Orthodox Unity, Forty-Second Generation Celestial Master, Protector of the State, Propagator of the Ancestral Teachings, Communicator of Sincerity, Venerator of the Dao, and Magnifier of Virtue, Grand Perfected in Charge of Daoist Affairs, is hereby invested with this title.\n\nSo ordered.",

Among them were also perfected beings of lofty Dao and wondrous transformation, manifesting the subtle and the evident, their spiritual transformations unfathomable. Moved by Our sincere heart, they attended the ritual assembly, bearing witness to the merit of goodness.\n\nOur virtue is meager, and what We cannot comprehend is aided by this assembly of goodness. Thus, the response of the Supreme Mystery was resounding, and abundant auspicious signs gathered. Witnessing these manifest resonances, We are assured that the spirits have received blessing, transcending to the Great Brahmā, forever attaining carefree wandering. This fulfills Our aspirations, and We specially bestow commendation.\n\nHenceforth, you must further exert your divine merit, ever more refining your essence and unity.

Moreover, five-colored auspicious lights stretched across the sky, their luminous mists glittering and brilliant, illuminating all with harmonious fusion.

      "translated_text": "On the fifteenth day of the ninth month in the forty-fourth year of the Jiajing reign, an edict bearing the imperial seal was issued, granting posthumous honors and consolation rites. The imperial decree read: \"The memorial and all matters concerning posthumous honors and consolation shall be reviewed by the Ministry of Rites in accordance with precedent. Respect this.\"\n\n**Edict for the Seven Altars of Sacrificial Rites**\nOn a certain day in the forty-fourth year of the Jiajing reign, the Emperor dispatched Envoy Yao Guangzhu of the Bureau of Ceremonial Commissioners to convey sacrificial rites to the Grand Perfected Zhang Yongxu, saying: \"You inherited the leadership of the Daoist teachings and prayed for the state’s blessings. Yet before reaching the prime of life, you were suddenly taken by fate. In grace and consolation, We continue to nurture your orphaned heir. This edict of sacrifice is specially bestowed, and your burial site shall be prepared. May your spirit, if not yet departed, receive this decree with reverence.\"\n\n**Edict for the First Seventh-Day Rite**\n\"It was you who inherited the teachings and prayed for blessings, yet you departed this world so soon. Now, on this first seventh-day, We bestow this sacrificial edict once more. If you are aware, receive it with gratitude.\"\n\n**Edicts for the Hundredth Day, Burial, First Anniversary, and Second Anniversary, with Purification Rites**\n\"Though you have passed, time has swiftly advanced. Now, on this appointed day, We dispatch these sacrificial rites. May your spirit, if not yet extinguished, partake of this profound grace.\"\n\n**Imperial Proclamation**\n\"The transmission of the Dao follows its lineage; the teachings flourish from the Primordial Beginning. Humanity is rooted in its ancestors, and rites of reverence are weighty in their veneration. You, Zhang Yandai, grandfather of Zhang Guoxiang, Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, who upheld sincerity in the Dao, expounded the mysteries, and propagated the teachings, emerged from the Mystic Gate and wandered beyond the mundane. Within your numinous abode, you nurtured true virtue, and your grandson now carries forth the ancestral legacy, silently aiding in the transformation of governance. In response to your grandson’s petition, We posthumously confer upon you the title of Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, who upheld sincerity and revered the model, that you may partake of the imperial favor and spread your illustrious radiance in the records of immortals.\"\n\n**Proclamation**\n\"The origin of the Daoist teachings lies in the Mystic Female; the prosperity of a grandson’s legacy begins in the inner chambers. You, Lady Yang, grandmother of Zhang Guoxiang, Grand Perfected of the Orthodox Unity Tradition, who upheld sincerity in the Dao, expounded the mysteries, and propagated the teachings, were a woman of refined virtue from a noble family, wed to a descendant of immortals. Through two generations, you fostered auspicious omens and grandly continued the true lineage. We posthumously confer upon you the title of Serene and Virtuous Mystic Lady, that you may reverently receive the imperial decree and perpetuate your numinous legacy.\"\n\n**Imperial Patent**\nIssued on the fourteenth day of the third month in the thirtieth year of the Wanli reign.",
