  "full_translation": "**Commentary on the \"Song of the Golden Elixir of Returned Cinnabar\"**\n\n*Composed by Yuanyangzi (Yang Shenwei) of the Tang, annotated by Master Tongxuan (Zhang Jianming, a Daoist of the Five Dynasties). Pertains to External Alchemy. One fascicle. Source text: \"Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era,\" *Dongzhen* section, Methods category.*\n\n**Commentary on the \"Song of the Golden Elixir of Returned Cinnabar\"**\n*Composed by Yuanyangzi, annotated by Master Tongxuan*\n\nTo discuss the Dragon and Tiger is to speak of alternate names for lead and mercury. The *Can Tong Qi* states: \"The Golden Tiger is the root of returned cinnabar.\" The Golden Tiger is not the name of two separate substances but refers to lead. Lead is black in color and belongs to the north. The north corresponds to water, and the number of water is one; thus, one who knows the One completes all matters.\n\nThe *Can Tong Qi* further says: \"One thing bears five hues, eternally serving as the immortal’s bounty.\" Lead contains the five colors and corresponds to the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. As lead embodies the Five Phases, it manifests the five hues.\n\nLaozi said: \"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; spirits attain the One and become numinous; the myriad things attain the One and come into being; lords and kings attain the One and govern the world aright.\" These words illustrate the great Dao, yet they speak of matters directly, beyond the comprehension of vulgar scholars.\n\nIt is also said: \"Embrace the One and guard the center; your body will naturally become harmonious.\" How vast is the One!\n\nThe *Can Tong Qi* states: \"Three yellows and one black—seek death in vain.\" The three yellows and one black are the names of the numinous elixir. In humans, this corresponds to the Three Ones. By cultivating the Three Ones, one is certain to ascend as an immortal.\n\nThe One pertains to water, and water is lead. The Three pertain to wood, and wood is cinnabar. Cinnabar is the essence of the Great Yang of the south, and its essence is mercury. Mercury is the Azure Dragon.\n\nThe *Can Tong Qi* says: \"Cinnabar, the essence of wood, unites with metal to become whole.\" Lead corresponds to metal, while mercury corresponds to wood. Wood is the Azure Dragon, residing in the east as the Middle Son. Lead, corresponding to metal, occupies the west as the White Tiger, the Middle Daughter.\n\nThus, the *Song of the Twenty-Four Sages* states: \"The Middle Son and Middle Daughter dwell at noon; the gates of *mao* and *you* are the sun and moon, clearly marking the beginning of the long cycle.\" Another song says: \"The Middle Son rides the Young Maiden, together forming water and earth.\" These are the great numbers of the Five Phases.\n\nMercury, when refined into cinnabar, becomes the essence of the Great Yang and is called the Azure Dragon. Cinnabar pertains to wood, which is green; wood generates fire, which is red and belongs to the south. The parents reside in the east, hence the name Azure Dragon.\n\nAn ancient song says: \"White Horse’s Teeth, fine cinnabar. Mercury emerges from cinnabar as liquid silver.\" Mercury pertains to yang and is the essence of yang, prone to flight, hence called the \"Young Maiden,\" difficult to subdue.\n\nThus, the *Can Tong Qi* states: \"The maiden by the river is numinous and most divine. When fire is applied, she flies away, leaving no trace of dust. Like a hidden dragon or concealed ghost, none know where she dwells. To subdue her, use Yellow Teeth as the root.\" Yellow Teeth refers to lead, black in color and belonging to the north’s *ren* and *gui* waters, the essence of the Great Yin, capable of restraining yang. Yang is inherently rigid and can be subdued by yin. Mercury pertains to fire, lead to water; water extinguishes fire.\n\nThough wood is upright, it is harmed by metal. Though water is yielding, it is overcome by earth. Though earth is virtuous, it is overcome by wood. Though metal is firm, it is melted by fire. This is the mutual overcoming of the Five Phases, the constant principle of the great Dao.\n\nThe profound roots of lead and mercury are unfathomable to the world. The old man with white hair pores over ancient formulas at his desk, yet in his confusion, dismisses them as unreliable. The meanings of lead and mercury, the floating and sinking of metals and stones—people merely follow conventional lead and mercury to concoct the great elixir, refining it to remove toxins. They treasure it, consume it, and call it the great elixir, yet none who partake live out their natural span; most die young. The world is greatly deluded, bringing ruin upon themselves.\n\nFor instance, in refining and consuming lead, Master Zhang Guo said: \"Lead is highly toxic and readily kills.\" People, unaware of its nature, devote themselves to its refinement, only to suffer in vain.\n\nThe *Can Tong Qi* states: \"Diving into water to hunt pheasants and hares, climbing mountains to seek fish and dragons.\" How far is this from the truth?\n\nThose who refine numinous medicines and various minerals fail to distinguish yin and yang, floating and sinking; they do not understand hardness and softness, nor the roles of ruler and minister, nor the methods of subjugation. How can they know which medicines to refine?\n\nYang medicines are subdued by yin, and yin medicines by yang. One must know the ruler and minister and clearly discern the methods of subjugation. Recognize the Vermilion Bird to regulate the fire times; listen carefully for the cry of the infant. When the nine-nines cycle is complete, the numinous medicine is subdued by fire.\n\nThe path of consuming medicines is arduous, not because the medicines are hard to obtain, but because people’s words and hearts diverge, making transmission difficult.\n\nFormerly, Wang Yang once grasped its methods but suffered from poverty and presented his formula to Emperor Wu, saying: \"Cinnabar subdued by fire can be made into gold.\" He relied on the emperor’s power to complete the alchemical work.\n\nMaster Baiyun of the Right Army longed for this Dao for over twenty years. Yet even the ancient worthies labored diligently for over twenty years. How much more so for worldly people, who value wealth over righteousness, whose words and hearts diverge, who withhold hidden virtue, recklessly scheme, envy the worthy, and indulge in worldly passions all day—how can they seek the perfected ones?\n\nThose who study the Dao must empty their hearts, value righteousness over wealth, take great compassion as their foundation, widely practice hidden virtue, pity the orphaned and aid the widowed, and guard tranquility, existing as if they are and are not. Only such people can succeed in seeking the Dao.\n\nYet people merely refine lead and mercury, subdue them with fire, and claim to secure human life.\n\nMaster Zhang Guo stated: Once, two men swore brotherhood and each took a catty of mercury into Yangcheng Mountain to refine. After three years, the mercury subdued by fire turned the color of red glass, radiant and lovely, and they called it the Great Elixir. Each consumed two ounces, yet as they walked, they required support, and within a hundred days, they died—what benefit did it bring to their lives?\n\nNowadays, many take the Golden Lord and merge it with mercury, gathering its golden blossoms to extract its essence and refine it for years. The lead blossoms turn the color of burnished gold, and they call this the Great Elixir. Yet those who consume it do not last a full month before their faces and eyes wither yellow, their bodies afflicted with consumptive illness, their complexions turning green.\n\nMaster Zhang Guo said: Lead is highly toxic, capable of killing a man, seeping into his blood and vessels. Shallow learners, unaware of its true nature, take worldly lead and mercury to refine, believing these substances—possessing only the power to transform the five metals—can extend life. The profound mysteries of lead and mercury are unfathomable; how can worldly men grasp them with mere surface knowledge?\n\nMoreover, mercury has three kinds, yet people today recognize only one—quicksilver. The *Cantong Qi*, the *Five Phases in Mutual Resemblance*, the *Golden and Azure Hidden Correspondences*, and Master Zhang’s five treatises, along with various immortal scriptures, all speak of this \"mercury that pours like mercury.\" Yet people know only this one; the other two kinds of mercury remain unknown to them. Lacking deep study, they rely on hearsay, squandering their youthful years without achievement, only to be harmed by lead and mercury.\n\nThus, those who seek longevity through ingestion are often misled by the very medicines they consume. As it is said: \"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao.\" And again: \"Lead and mercury, the two yins, are the heart of returning elixirs.\" And: \"Among the five metals, yin is the master.\" And: \"All things bear yin and embrace yang.\" And: \"Yin is the ruler; the ruler is the master.\" The *Yinfu Jing* states: \"Though there are a hundred methods of golden elixir refinement, the essence lies in the divine water and flowery pond.\" Is this not clear? Yet people take lead and mercury to be this divine water and flowery pond, revealing their ignorance of its profound mysteries.\n\nThus, the *Cantong Qi* says: \"Those who rely on textual interpretations and impose their own meanings distort the subtle principles, which are not recorded on bamboo and silk.\" And again: \"To inscribe such truths on bamboo and silk risks leaking the celestial tally.\" The *Baopuzi* states: \"If ordinary people knew this medicine, immortals would fill the heavens.\" Laozi said: \"Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.\" Master Zuo the Perfected One said: \"True knowledge arises from the heart’s source; those who attain it have accumulated blessings over past lives, with three generations of grace flowing downward, so that their descendants gain it without study.\"\n\nHow can today’s shallow-minded people seek it? They exhaust themselves in vain, their spirits laboring, yet never grasp the principle. Thus, the Dao of yin and yang is difficult to achieve.\n\nThe ancients urged people to seek the Dao, teaching them to study prescriptions and inquire into scriptures, thoroughly understanding the words of the ancients. If one then applies careful thought, the Great Dao will become clear. Laozi said: \"A tree as wide as a man’s embrace grows from a tiny sprout. A nine-tiered terrace rises from heaped earth. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\" Thus, the learner must first empty the heart, accumulate merit through diligent effort, and only then gradually advance toward spiritual attainment.\n\nYet today’s people are impatient—how can they seek the Dao? They indulge in idle curiosity, never encountering a perfected one to transmit the method, yet they recklessly pass it to the frivolous.\n\nMaster Zhang Guo’s transmission records: Once, two men swore brotherhood but did not record their names. They were butchers who owed official debts and fled into the mountains to die. One, resolute in purpose, suddenly encountered an immortal who had taken the form of a common laborer, carrying grass to sell. The immortal called to the butcher: \"This mountain is secluded, with no human traces—how did you come here?\" The butcher replied: \"I owe an official debt; my father and son are separated, and I am ashamed to face my village. I entered this mountain to end my life. I have heard that immortals dwell here—if I chance upon one and seek the Dao, I will never return to the world of men.\"\n\nThe immortal said: \"You fled into the mountains to seek the Dao because of an official debt. To seek the Dao, one must have resolve. I am an immortal—can you maintain your determination?\" He pointed to a stone seat a *zhang* thick and said: \"If you can command a wooden drill to bore through it, I will transmit the Dao to you.\" The butcher replied: \"This is a test of my resolve.\" He took wood from the mountain and drilled for over twenty years, penetrating seven *chi*, with three *chi* remaining. His resolve never wavered. When the mountain’s wood was exhausted, he appealed to the celestial immortal, who caused the stone to be pierced. Then he bestowed the Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir, and the butcher ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nMany such people exist. Master Zuo Ci practiced rituals in a cave for three years, day and night without rest. Master Yin studied for over twenty years. Yet no one who attained the Dao did so by sitting idly.\n\nToday’s people, however, are greedy for fame and profit, valuing wealth over righteousness, entangled in worldly passions. Though they may think of the Dao all day, how can they seek it when their bones are decayed and their qi depleted? Their allotted years are nearly spent, and nothing can save them. How can they know that the numinous elixir possesses the power to extend life, to absorb the primal qi of the embryo and prolong existence?\n\nNow, I have compiled the surviving texts of the ancient worthies to enlighten new learners, adding songs to share with like-minded seekers, that they may not be misled. For the world’s people are duplicitous, their words and hearts at odds—difficult to transmit the teachings to.\n\nOnce, Wang Yang obtained a method but suffered from poverty. He presented his formula to Emperor Wu, saying: \"Cinnabar subdued by fire can be made into gold.\" Yet even with the emperor’s support, the Dao was only thus accomplished. The Right Army’s Master Baiyun longed for this Dao for over twenty years. Yet even the ancient worthies labored diligently for over twenty years. How much more so for worldly people, who value wealth over righteousness, whose words and hearts diverge, who withhold hidden virtue, recklessly scheme, envy the worthy, and indulge in worldly passions all day—how can they seek the perfected ones?\n\nThose who study the Dao must empty their hearts, value righteousness over wealth, and take great compassion as their foundation. They must widely practice hidden virtue, pity the orphaned and aid the widowed, and guard a state of tranquil indifference—seeming both present and absent. Only such people may succeed in seeking the Dao.\n\nYet worldly people merely refine lead and mercury, subdue them with fire, and claim this seals and sustains life. Master Zhang Guo said: Once, two men swore brotherhood. Each took a catty of mercury into Yangcheng Mountain to refine. After three years, the mercury subdued by fire turned the color of red glass, radiant and lovely, and they called it the Great Elixir. Each consumed two ounces, but as they walked, they required support, and within a hundred days, both died—what benefit was there to body and life?\n\nNowadays, many take the \"Golden Duke\" (lead) and cast mercury into it, gathering the golden flowers to refine their essence. After years of practice, the lead flowers turn the color of burnished gold, and they call this the Great Elixir. Yet those who consume it within months grow sallow and emaciated, afflicted with consumptive illness, their complexions turning ashen.\n\nMaster Zhang Guo said: Lead is highly toxic, capable of killing a person by disrupting their blood and vessels. The shallowly learned, unaware of its true nature, take worldly lead and mercury for refinement. Yet worldly lead and mercury possess only the power to transform the five metals—how could they extend the principle of life? The profound mysteries of lead and mercury are unfathomable; how could worldly people, with their superficial probing, ever grasp them?\n\nMoreover, mercury has three kinds, yet people today know only one—quicksilver. The *Cantong Qi*, along with the *Five Phases in Mutual Resemblance*, the *Golden and Azure Hidden Correspondences*, and Master Zhang’s five treatises among the immortals’ scriptures, all speak of this \"mercury that pours forth mercury.\" Yet people know only this one; the other two mercuries remain unknown to them. Due to their lack of learning and inquiry, they rely on hearsay, squandering their youthful years in vain, seeing nothing accomplished, only to be harmed by lead and mercury. Thus, those who seek longevity through ingestion are often misled by the very medicines they take.\n\nAs it is said: \"The Dao is the interplay of one yin and one yang.\" And again: \"Lead and mercury, the two yins, are the heart of the returned elixir.\" And: \"Among the five metals, yin is the master.\" And: \"All things bear yin and embrace yang.\" And: \"Yin is the ruler; the ruler is the master.\" The *Yinfu Jing* states: \"Among the hundred methods of the golden elixir, the essential lies in the divine water and flowery pond\"—is this not clear? Yet people take lead and mercury to be this divine water and flowery pond, revealing their ignorance of its profound mysteries.\n\nThus, the *Cantong Qi* says: \"Those who rely on textual exegesis and impose their own interpretations miss the subtle principles, which are not recorded on bamboo and silk.\" And again: \"To inscribe these truths on bamboo and silk risks leaking the celestial tally.\" The *Baopuzi* states: \"If ordinary people knew this medicine, immortals would fill the heavens.\" Laozi said: \"Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.\" Master Zuo the Perfected said: \"True knowledge arises from the heart’s source; those who attain it do so through accumulated blessings from past lives, with three generations of grace flowing downward, so that descendants gain it without study.\"\n\nHow can today’s shallow-minded people hope to seek it? They exhaust themselves in vain, never grasping the principle. Thus, the Dao of yin and yang is difficult to achieve.\n\nThe ancients urged people to seek the Dao, teaching them to study prescriptions and inquire into scriptures, thoroughly understanding the words of the ancients. If one then applies their mind to reflection, they may comprehend the Great Dao. Laozi said: \"A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tiny sprout. A nine-tiered terrace rises from mounds of earth. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\" Thus, the student must first empty their heart, accumulate merit through diligent effort, and only then gradually advance toward spiritual attainment.\n\nYet people today are impatient—how can they seek the Dao? They engage in empty pursuits, never meeting a perfected one to transmit the teachings, yet they recklessly pass them to the frivolous.\n\nMaster Zhang Guo’s transmission records: Once, two men swore brotherhood but did not record their names. They worked as butchers and owed official debts. Fleeing on foot into the mountains, they sought their own deaths. One, resolute in purpose, suddenly encountered an immortal who had transformed into a common laborer, carrying grass to sell. The immortal called to the butcher: \"This mountain is secluded, with no human traces—how did you come here?\" The butcher replied: \"I owe official debts; my father and son are separated, and I am ashamed to face my neighbors. I entered this mountain to end my life. I have heard that immortals dwell here—if I chance upon one and seek the Dao, I will never return to the world of men.\"\n\nThe immortal said: \"You fled into the mountains to seek the Dao because of official debts.

I am an immortal—can you maintain your determination?\" He pointed to a stone seat about a *zhang* thick and said: \"If you can command wood to bore through it, I will transmit the Dao to you.\" The butcher replied: \"This is a test of my resolve.\" He took wood from the mountain and bored into the stone. After over twenty years, he had penetrated seven *chi*, with three *chi* remaining. His resolve never wavered. When the mountain’s wood was exhausted, he appealed to the celestial immortal, who caused the stone to be fully pierced. Then he bestowed the great medicine of the golden elixir, and the butcher ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nMany such people exist. Zuo Ci practiced rituals in a cave for three years, day and night without rest. Master Yin studied for over twenty years. Yet no one who attained the Dao did so by sitting idly. People today, however, are greedy for fame and profit, valuing wealth and worldly affairs. Though they may think of the Dao all day, how can they seek it when their bones are brittle and their qi depleted? Their allotted years are nearly spent, and nothing can save them. How could they know that the numinous elixir has the power to extend life, absorbing the primordial qi of the womb to sustain the principle of longevity?\n\nNow, I have compiled the surviving texts of the ancient worthies to enlighten new learners, setting them to verse to share with like-minded seekers, that they may not be misled.\n\n*Song of the Returned Elixir and Golden Liquid, with Annotations*\nHarmonious qi harmonizes the Great Beginning,\nThe primal qi ultimately returns to the One.\n\nHarmonious qi is the primordial harmony of Heaven and Earth, the One qi. It gives birth to the myriad things, and thus Heaven (qian) and Earth (kun) receive the primordial qi. Mother and child are originally born of one another, yet in their mutual generation, they also mutually lose one another. The mother is the foundation of water—she is the mother of mercury. Through the mother, metal is born; metal, in an instant, transforms and returns to the mother, their appearances changing. The ancients called this \"mother and child.\"\n\nRefining the mysterious yin essence in the yin crucible, the moon’s cycle is wed to the sun. \"Wed\" means to go forth. At the initial stirring of fire, the *tun* hexagram arises; with each ten-day cycle, a line is added, until the *jiji* hexagram is complete. The sixty-four hexagrams conclude and begin anew. Once the sun and moon have thus conjoined, the Returned Elixir emerges in crimson splendor. Following the yin-yang lines of the hexagrams, the sun and moon, qian and kun, the primordial qi returns as the Elixir—radiant and manifest.\n\nFrom the north, one takes the \"river chariot\"—the river chariot is the foundation of water, within which dwells the \"maiden,\" mercury. From the south, the Vermilion Bird—this is the fire of bing and ding. When these two qi unite, the Returned Elixir is accomplished. Azure water gives birth to wondrous flowers; white flowers cradle jade-like essence. Azure water is the foundation of water. The white flowers arise as metal flowers, refined through yin and yang, emerging as the metal of the west—flowers like jade blossoms.\n\nThe dragon and rainbow intermingle; the *daogui* must be guarded with utmost care. Here, the dragon represents metal and fire. When first placed in the crucible, their subjugation is not yet settled, and one fears their escape. Thus, one must be vigilant and secretive, allowing no leakage—the *daogui* vessels must be secure. Alone, it plays within qian and kun, yet it nourishes the myriad things. Only the metal flower and mercury can form the Returned Elixir. It gives life to the myriad things, governs their life and death, and endures as long as Heaven and Earth—unlike the eight stones or common gold and silver.\n\nThe folly of people today lies in mixing mercury with various metals and firing them, harming countless lives. The above is but one example. The \"maiden\" is the mysterious yin essence; the two kinds both return to the One. The maiden is mercury; the mysterious yin is the foundation of water. When these two qi unite, they become one body and form the Returned Elixir—hence these words.\n\nThe mercury of the Yellow River is not the mercury found in cinnabar by ordinary men. Rather, it is conjoined with the yin pitch pipes, and the fire timing is fulfilled by the yin pitch. The vast and undulating Crimson Dragon coils—this is the red fire, the dragon medicine. When the two qi unite, they undergo a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, divine and numinous as a dragon, beyond comprehension. Thus, the fire timing observes the appearance and essence, following the waxing and waning of the moon to perceive its form.\n\nIt transforms into \"hoof-wrapped gold\"—a name for the Returned Elixir. The Yellow Sprout has no root or stalk. Yellow is the color of metal; the sprout is the budding flower. It arises from the qi of Heaven and Earth, not from refining mercury in stones or extracting flowers from lead—thus, it is called \"rootless,\" not born of dross or filth.\n\nThe *Fire Records* comprise three hundred chapters; to know them is to never err. To understand mercury, recognize the metal flower, and grasp the fire timing of the Returned Elixir is to never fail. Like a mule conceiving a foal, it bears its own form and essence. The mule’s foal emerges from the mother; when the metal flower unites with mercury, the Returned Elixir is formed, and mercury is transformed.\n\n*Annotations to the Song of the Returned Elixir and Golden Liquid* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**Commentary on the \"Song of the Golden Elixir of Returned Cinnabar\"**\n\n*Composed by Yuanyangzi (Yang Shenwei) of the Tang, annotated by Master Tongxuan (Zhang Jianming, a Daoist of the Five Dynasties). Pertains to External Alchemy. One fascicle. Source text: \"Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era,\" *Dongzhen* section, Methods category.*\n\n**Commentary on the \"Song of the Golden Elixir of Returned Cinnabar\"**\n*Composed by Yuanyangzi, annotated by Master Tongxuan*\n\nTo discuss the Dragon and Tiger is to speak of alternate names for lead and mercury. The *Can Tong Qi* states: \"The Golden Tiger is the root of returned cinnabar.\" The Golden Tiger is not the name of two separate substances but refers to lead. Lead is black in color and belongs to the north. The north corresponds to water, and the number of water is one; thus, one who knows the One completes all matters.\n\nThe *Can Tong Qi* further says: \"One thing bears five hues, eternally serving as the immortal’s bounty.\" Lead contains the five colors and corresponds to the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. As lead embodies the Five Phases, it manifests the five hues.\n\nLaozi said: \"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; spirits attain the One and become numinous; the myriad things attain the One and come into being; lords and kings attain the One and govern the world aright.\" These words illustrate the great Dao, yet they speak of matters directly, beyond the comprehension of vulgar scholars.\n\nIt is also said: \"Embrace the One and guard the center; your body will naturally become harmonious.\" How vast is the One!\n\nThe *Can Tong Qi* states: \"Three yellows and one black—seek death in vain.\" The three yellows and one black are the names of the numinous elixir. In humans, this corresponds to the Three Ones. By cultivating the Three Ones, one is certain to ascend as an immortal.\n\nThe One pertains to water, and water is lead. The Three pertain to wood, and wood is cinnabar. Cinnabar is the essence of the Great Yang of the south, and its essence is mercury. Mercury is the Azure Dragon.\n\nThe *Can Tong Qi* says: \"Cinnabar, the essence of wood, unites with metal to become whole.\" Lead corresponds to metal, while mercury corresponds to wood. Wood is the Azure Dragon, residing in the east as the Middle Son. Lead, corresponding to metal, occupies the west as the White Tiger, the Middle Daughter.\n\nThus, the *Song of the Twenty-Four Sages* states: \"The Middle Son and Middle Daughter dwell at noon; the gates of *mao* and *you* are the sun and moon, clearly marking the beginning of the long cycle.\" Another song says: \"The Middle Son rides the Young Maiden, together forming water and earth.\" These are the great numbers of the Five Phases.\n\nMercury, when refined into cinnabar, becomes the essence of the Great Yang and is called the Azure Dragon. Cinnabar pertains to wood, which is green; wood generates fire, which is red and belongs to the south. The parents reside in the east, hence the name Azure Dragon.\n\nAn ancient song says: \"White Horse’s Teeth, fine cinnabar. Mercury emerges from cinnabar as liquid silver.\" Mercury pertains to yang and is the essence of yang, prone to flight, hence called the \"Young Maiden,\" difficult to subdue.\n\nThus, the *Can Tong Qi* states: \"The maiden by the river is numinous and most divine. When fire is applied, she flies away, leaving no trace of dust. Like a hidden dragon or concealed ghost, none know where she dwells. To subdue her, use Yellow Teeth as the root.\" Yellow Teeth refers to lead, black in color and belonging to the north’s *ren* and *gui* waters, the essence of the Great Yin, capable of restraining yang. Yang is inherently rigid and can be subdued by yin. Mercury pertains to fire, lead to water; water extinguishes fire.\n\nThough wood is upright, it is harmed by metal. Though water is yielding, it is overcome by earth. Though earth is virtuous, it is overcome by wood. Though metal is firm, it is melted by fire. This is the mutual overcoming of the Five Phases, the constant principle of the great Dao.\n\nThe profound roots of lead and mercury are unfathomable to the world. The old man with white hair pores over ancient formulas at his desk, yet in his confusion, dismisses them as unreliable. The meanings of lead and mercury, the floating and sinking of metals and stones—people merely follow conventional lead and mercury to concoct the great elixir, refining it to remove toxins. They treasure it, consume it, and call it the great elixir, yet none who partake live out their natural span; most die young. The world is greatly deluded, bringing ruin upon themselves.\n\nFor instance, in refining and consuming lead, Master Zhang Guo said: \"Lead is highly toxic and readily kills.\" People, unaware of its nature, devote themselves to its refinement, only to suffer in vain.\n\nThe *Can Tong Qi* states: \"Diving into water to hunt pheasants and hares, climbing mountains to seek fish and dragons.\" How far is this from the truth?\n\nThose who refine numinous medicines and various minerals fail to distinguish yin and yang, floating and sinking; they do not understand hardness and softness, nor the roles of ruler and minister, nor the methods of subjugation. How can they know which medicines to refine?\n\nYang medicines are subdued by yin, and yin medicines by yang. One must know the ruler and minister and clearly discern the methods of subjugation. Recognize the Vermilion Bird to regulate the fire times; listen carefully for the cry of the infant. When the nine-nines cycle is complete, the numinous medicine is subdued by fire.\n\nThe path of consuming medicines is arduous, not because the medicines are hard to obtain, but because people’s words and hearts diverge, making transmission difficult.\n\nFormerly, Wang Yang once grasped its methods but suffered from poverty and presented his formula to Emperor Wu, saying: \"Cinnabar subdued by fire can be made into gold.\" He relied on the emperor’s power to complete the alchemical work.\n\nMaster Baiyun of the Right Army longed for this Dao for over twenty years. Yet even the ancient worthies labored diligently for over twenty years. How much more so for worldly people, who value wealth over righteousness, whose words and hearts diverge, who withhold hidden virtue, recklessly scheme, envy the worthy, and indulge in worldly passions all day—how can they seek the perfected ones?\n\nThose who study the Dao must empty their hearts, value righteousness over wealth, take great compassion as their foundation, widely practice hidden virtue, pity the orphaned and aid the widowed, and guard tranquility, existing as if they are and are not. Only such people can succeed in seeking the Dao.\n\nYet people merely refine lead and mercury, subdue them with fire, and claim to secure human life.",

      "translated_text": "Master Zhang Guo stated: Once, two men swore brotherhood and each took a catty of mercury into Yangcheng Mountain to refine. After three years, the mercury subdued by fire turned the color of red glass, radiant and lovely, and they called it the Great Elixir. Each consumed two ounces, yet as they walked, they required support, and within a hundred days, they died—what benefit did it bring to their lives?\n\nNowadays, many take the Golden Lord and merge it with mercury, gathering its golden blossoms to extract its essence and refine it for years. The lead blossoms turn the color of burnished gold, and they call this the Great Elixir. Yet those who consume it do not last a full month before their faces and eyes wither yellow, their bodies afflicted with consumptive illness, their complexions turning green.\n\nMaster Zhang Guo said: Lead is highly toxic, capable of killing a man, seeping into his blood and vessels. Shallow learners, unaware of its true nature, take worldly lead and mercury to refine, believing these substances—possessing only the power to transform the five metals—can extend life. The profound mysteries of lead and mercury are unfathomable; how can worldly men grasp them with mere surface knowledge?\n\nMoreover, mercury has three kinds, yet people today recognize only one—quicksilver. The *Cantong Qi*, the *Five Phases in Mutual Resemblance*, the *Golden and Azure Hidden Correspondences*, and Master Zhang’s five treatises, along with various immortal scriptures, all speak of this \"mercury that pours like mercury.\" Yet people know only this one; the other two kinds of mercury remain unknown to them. Lacking deep study, they rely on hearsay, squandering their youthful years without achievement, only to be harmed by lead and mercury.\n\nThus, those who seek longevity through ingestion are often misled by the very medicines they consume. As it is said: \"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao.\" And again: \"Lead and mercury, the two yins, are the heart of returning elixirs.\" And: \"Among the five metals, yin is the master.\" And: \"All things bear yin and embrace yang.\" And: \"Yin is the ruler; the ruler is the master.\" The *Yinfu Jing* states: \"Though there are a hundred methods of golden elixir refinement, the essence lies in the divine water and flowery pond.\" Is this not clear? Yet people take lead and mercury to be this divine water and flowery pond, revealing their ignorance of its profound mysteries.\n\nThus, the *Cantong Qi* says: \"Those who rely on textual interpretations and impose their own meanings distort the subtle principles, which are not recorded on bamboo and silk.\" And again: \"To inscribe such truths on bamboo and silk risks leaking the celestial tally.\" The *Baopuzi* states: \"If ordinary people knew this medicine, immortals would fill the heavens.\" Laozi said: \"Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.\" Master Zuo the Perfected One said: \"True knowledge arises from the heart’s source; those who attain it have accumulated blessings over past lives, with three generations of grace flowing downward, so that their descendants gain it without study.\"\n\nHow can today’s shallow-minded people seek it? They exhaust themselves in vain, their spirits laboring, yet never grasp the principle. Thus, the Dao of yin and yang is difficult to achieve.\n\nThe ancients urged people to seek the Dao, teaching them to study prescriptions and inquire into scriptures, thoroughly understanding the words of the ancients. If one then applies careful thought, the Great Dao will become clear. Laozi said: \"A tree as wide as a man’s embrace grows from a tiny sprout. A nine-tiered terrace rises from heaped earth. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\" Thus, the learner must first empty the heart, accumulate merit through diligent effort, and only then gradually advance toward spiritual attainment.\n\nYet today’s people are impatient—how can they seek the Dao? They indulge in idle curiosity, never encountering a perfected one to transmit the method, yet they recklessly pass it to the frivolous.\n\nMaster Zhang Guo’s transmission records: Once, two men swore brotherhood but did not record their names. They were butchers who owed official debts and fled into the mountains to die. One, resolute in purpose, suddenly encountered an immortal who had taken the form of a common laborer, carrying grass to sell. The immortal called to the butcher: \"This mountain is secluded, with no human traces—how did you come here?\" The butcher replied: \"I owe an official debt; my father and son are separated, and I am ashamed to face my village. I entered this mountain to end my life. I have heard that immortals dwell here—if I chance upon one and seek the Dao, I will never return to the world of men.\"\n\nThe immortal said: \"You fled into the mountains to seek the Dao because of an official debt. To seek the Dao, one must have resolve. I am an immortal—can you maintain your determination?\" He pointed to a stone seat a *zhang* thick and said: \"If you can command a wooden drill to bore through it, I will transmit the Dao to you.\" The butcher replied: \"This is a test of my resolve.\" He took wood from the mountain and drilled for over twenty years, penetrating seven *chi*, with three *chi* remaining. His resolve never wavered. When the mountain’s wood was exhausted, he appealed to the celestial immortal, who caused the stone to be pierced. Then he bestowed the Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir, and the butcher ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nMany such people exist. Master Zuo Ci practiced rituals in a cave for three years, day and night without rest. Master Yin studied for over twenty years. Yet no one who attained the Dao did so by sitting idly.\n\nToday’s people, however, are greedy for fame and profit, valuing wealth over righteousness, entangled in worldly passions. Though they may think of the Dao all day, how can they seek it when their bones are decayed and their qi depleted? Their allotted years are nearly spent, and nothing can save them. How can they know that the numinous elixir possesses the power to extend life, to absorb the primal qi of the embryo and prolong existence?\n\nNow, I have compiled the surviving texts of the ancient worthies to enlighten new learners, adding songs to share with like-minded seekers, that they may not be misled. For the world’s people are duplicitous, their words and hearts at odds—difficult to transmit the teachings to.\n\nOnce, Wang Yang obtained a method but suffered from poverty. He presented his formula to Emperor Wu, saying: \"Cinnabar subdued by fire can be made into gold.\" Yet even with the emperor’s support, the Dao was only thus accomplished. The Right Army’s Master Baiyun longed for this Dao for over twenty years. Yet even the ancient worthies labored diligently for over twenty years.

It gives birth to the myriad things, and thus Heaven (qian) and Earth (kun) receive the primordial qi.

Following the yin-yang lines of the hexagrams, the sun and moon, qian and kun, the primordial qi returns as the Elixir—radiant and manifest.\n\nFrom the north, one takes the \"river chariot\"—the river chariot is the foundation of water, within which dwells the \"maiden,\" mercury.

Azure water gives birth to wondrous flowers; white flowers cradle jade-like essence. Azure water is the foundation of water. The white flowers arise as metal flowers, refined through yin and yang, emerging as the metal of the west—flowers like jade blossoms.\n\nThe dragon and rainbow intermingle; the *daogui* must be guarded with utmost care. Here, the dragon represents metal and fire. When first placed in the crucible, their subjugation is not yet settled, and one fears their escape. Thus, one must be vigilant and secretive, allowing no leakage—the *daogui* vessels must be secure. Alone, it plays within qian and kun, yet it nourishes the myriad things. Only the metal flower and mercury can form the Returned Elixir. It gives life to the myriad things, governs their life and death, and endures as long as Heaven and Earth—unlike the eight stones or common gold and silver.\n\nThe folly of people today lies in mixing mercury with various metals and firing them, harming countless lives. The above is but one example. The \"maiden\" is the mysterious yin essence; the two kinds both return to the One. The maiden is mercury; the mysterious yin is the foundation of water. When these two qi unite, they become one body and form the Returned Elixir—hence these words.\n\nThe mercury of the Yellow River is not the mercury found in cinnabar by ordinary men. Rather, it is conjoined with the yin pitch pipes, and the fire timing is fulfilled by the yin pitch. The vast and undulating Crimson Dragon coils—this is the red fire, the dragon medicine. When the two qi unite, they undergo a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, divine and numinous as a dragon, beyond comprehension. Thus, the fire timing observes the appearance and essence, following the waxing and waning of the moon to perceive its form.\n\nIt transforms into \"hoof-wrapped gold\"—a name for the Returned Elixir. The Yellow Sprout has no root or stalk. Yellow is the color of metal; the sprout is the budding flower. It arises from the qi of Heaven and Earth, not from refining mercury in stones or extracting flowers from lead—thus, it is called \"rootless,\" not born of dross or filth.\n\nThe *Fire Records* comprise three hundred chapters; to know them is to never err. To understand mercury, recognize the metal flower, and grasp the fire timing of the Returned Elixir is to never fail. Like a mule conceiving a foal, it bears its own form and essence. The mule’s foal emerges from the mother; when the metal flower unites with mercury, the Returned Elixir is formed, and mercury is transformed.\n\n*Annotations to the Song of the Returned Elixir and Golden Liquid* concludes.",
