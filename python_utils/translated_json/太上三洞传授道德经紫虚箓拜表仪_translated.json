  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Three Caverns Transmission Ritual for the *Daoist Canon of the Purple Void* and *Laozi’s Scripture on the Dao and Its Virtue*, with Prostration Memorial Rites**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Three Caverns Transmission Ritual for the *Daoist Canon of the Purple Void* and *Laozi’s Scripture on the Dao and Its Virtue*, with Prostration Memorial Rites*\nCompiled by Du Guangting of the Late Tang. A ritual manual for the transmission of scriptures, precepts, and registers of the Great Mystery Division. One fascicle.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Cavern Spirit Division, *Ritual Propriety* category.\n\n**The Supreme Three Caverns Transmission Ritual for the *Daoist Canon of the Purple Void* and *Laozi’s Scripture on the Dao and Its Virtue*, with Prostration Memorial Rites**\nCompiled by Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting\n\nThe disciple, having heard the master’s precepts and completed the thanksgiving, rises and circumambulates leftward while reciting the *Eight Hymns of Penetrating the Mystery*:\n\nThe supreme Dao is ever void and quiescent,\nIts mysterious transformation responds to the essence of the Perfected.\nDispersing spirit, it pervades all things,\nCongealing radiance within the Three Clarities.\nFrom the dim and indistinct, forms arise;\nIn the empty and boundless, the formless is seen.\nFollowing the course of time, it unfolds the verdant assembly,\nAdapting to conditions, it expounds the wondrous scripture.\nCultivate it, and one ascends the River of Stars;\nNeglect it, and one falls into the dark prison.\nHeavenly maidens scatter golden blossoms,\nDivine youths chant jade-like tones.\nTen blossoms revolve the jeweled canopy,\nNine phoenixes halt the cloudy encampment.\nShould one propagate these supreme traces,\nAll within the realm and state will know peace.\n\nFive hundred million heavens,\nThree thousand realms of the Dao.\nRight and wrong ever await their turn,\nLife and death endlessly cycle.\nDelusion gives rise to the hells of greed and wrath,\nVanity constructs the palaces of killing and harm.\nFalsely asserting self and other as distinct,\nHow can one know their sameness?\nThe six senses are all unreal,\nThe myriad dharmas all return to emptiness.\nWhen afflictions are exhausted, the body dissolves;\nWhen mind and sense-dusts cease, so too does consciousness.\nUnable to seek liberation,\nOne remains ever confined in the dragon’s cage.\nIf one desires perpetual freedom,\nBow to the ancestral teaching of the supreme Dao.\n\nHeaven and hell,\nOrdinary beings and sages—\nAll arise from the square inch of the heart,\nNo other cause remains.\nAwakened, one becomes a companion of wisdom;\nDeluded, one dwells near the blind and foolish.\nSuffering souls still possess awareness,\nSinful spirits too retain their numinous essence.\nWhy sink into the mire of affliction?\nTruly, it stems from disbelief in the Real.\nAbandoning the treasure above this body,\nOne stains oneself with the dust of the mundane world.\nHaving drifted into the sea of transmigration,\nOne drowns again at the ford of death and rebirth.\nIf one wishes to cross this suffering,\nSit in stillness and contemplate this body.\n\nExcellent is the Venerable Primordial Beginning,\nCompassionately delivering all beings.\nVirtue extends beyond the void,\nMerit fills the realms as numerous as motes of dust.\nExpounding the Great Vehicle scriptures,\nIt engenders supreme wisdom.\nReversing the cycles of countless kalpas,\nIts teaching pervades the three times.\nEssence penetrates the realm of form,\nMystery exhausts the boundless immaterial.\nEvery region in every direction,\nThe Dao responds to every celestial sovereign.\nProvisional and absolute, it delivers gods and humans,\nAdapting its mechanism to the great and small.\nIts divine function is unfathomable,\nShaping all without exception.\n\nSin and blessing are like reflections in a mirror,\nLife and death like the turning of a wheel.\nObserve only what departs in the light,\nWho perceives what arrives in the dark?\nUnaspiring for the palaces of the Three Heavens,\nOne grieves only for the terraces of the Five Sufferings.\nWhen the sinful soul is spent by fate,\nThe dark spirit responds to the unfolding of conditions.\nEssence and qi disperse like floating wisps,\nThe bodily frame long since turned to ash.\nContent to become a ghostly form,\nWho remembers entering the immortal’s womb?\nVainly wishing for one’s name in the Azure Register,\nYet sorrowfully hastened by the Black Book.\nThe Dharma-wheel is rarely glimpsed again,\nThe long night is truly lamentable.\nThis body is most pitiable—\nAll should cultivate the Way of life.\n\nWho says the white jade fungus\nShades the golden herb?\nResolve to practice the Six Perfections,\nDevote the heart to the Three Treasures.\nThe White Prime descends to receive,\nThe Red Child is ever embraced.\nThough this withered age is late to learn,\nIn youth one must seize the moment.\nKnowing contentment, one is carefree;\nGreed for glory only brings vexation.\nSitting, one sees the humble hut as vast;\nIn stillness, one perceives heaven and earth as small.\nAbiding in the One without wavering,\nHow can one speak of aging through eternity?\n\nThree thousand worlds divided,\nFive hundred million heavens transformed.\nEach unfolds a pure realm,\nEvery region possesses its excellence.\nNinefold radiance births the courtyard grasses,\nSeven treasures fill the pond’s lotuses.\nTravelers’ lodges array the vermilion sun,\nFlying terraces reflect the purple springs.\nBurning incense are all jade maidens,\nExpounding the Dharma are only divine immortals.\nBrahmā’s chant summons the nine-crying phoenix,\nThe censer wafts five-colored smoke.\nBow to the palace of the Void Sovereign,\nSing praises before the Most High.\n\nBeware of neglecting past lives,\nOne must trust in the field of blessings.\nThe Dao’s transformation spreads through the Three Primes,\nThe divine congeals, dividing the ten thousand images.\nThe Dragon Han unfolds the mysterious register,\nCelestial script descends in the Crimson Nebula.\nResponding to the time, the Dharma-drum resounds,\nFollowing the direction, the wondrous gate opens.\nThe Most High bestows supreme traces,\nMajesty and virtue blanket heaven and earth.\nThe divine scripture attends the Three Ones,\nThe wondrous principle lies in the Five Thousand Characters.\nWords arrayed in the Golden Flower Palace,\nName transmitted by the Jade Emperor.\nWithin the heart, the sun of treasure arises;\nUpon the body, clouds of gauze ascend.\nWhat need for the Ten Immortals as companions?\nThrough kalpas uncounted, one abides forever.\n\nNext, the *Hymn for the Transmission of the Scripture* is sung.\nIf the *Eight Hymns of Penetrating the Mystery* are not recited in full, this hymn follows the second:\n\nSoaring beyond the Great Void’s peaks,\nFlowing radiance abides in the Supreme Mystery.\nBeginningless and endless through the kalpas,\nIt eternally preserves heaven, earth, and humankind.\nThe lord of the realm studies its governance,\nThe Daoist recites it to attain immortality.\nThe worthy now receive and uphold it,\nTransmitting it in accord with the Dharma.\nIn times lacking a child of utmost virtue,\nGuard its secrecy, do not recklessly proclaim it.\nUphold it, and ascend to the Great Clarity;\nAbandon it, and fall into the Nine Springs.\nI expound the Dao of non-action,\nThrough quiescence and emptiness, attain spontaneity.\n\nNext, the master returns to his original position. The disciples face south, kneel toward the north, and invoke the Five Numinous Guardians, each by name, to receive the transmission:\n\nYour servant now, on behalf of disciple [Name], [Official Title], transmits the register of the *Venerable Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue of the Purple Void*. The announcement complete, we pray for the descent of the divine officials and retinue of the Nine Heavens of the Central Heaven of the Eastern Direction, the Nine Yi Elders of the Blue-Green Lord, the Jade Maidens of the Blue Waist, the Jade Lads of Blue Radiance, and all the spirit officials of the Eastern Pole, from the Jia-Yi officials, along with the True Officials of the Year Star, the immortals and divine soldiers of the Eastern Marchmount, numbering ninety thousand, to enter the Purple Tenuity Palace within the body of disciple [Name], to guard and protect the true scripture, that [Name] may eternally ascend to the Dao’s fruit. [Name] receives this.\n\nWe pray for the descent of the divine officials and retinue of the Three Heavens of the Central Heaven of the Southern Direction, the Eight Man Elders of the Crimson Lord, the Jade Maidens of the Crimson Palace, the Jade Lads of Cinnabar Spirit, and all the spirit officials of the Southern Pole, from the Bing-Ding officials, along with the True Officials of Mars, the immortals and divine soldiers of the Southern Marchmount, numbering thirty thousand, to enter the Great One’s Crimson Palace within the body of disciple [Name], to attend and serve the precious scripture, that [Name] may eternally ascend to the Dao’s fruit.

[Name] receives this.\n\nWe pray for the descent of the divine officials and retinue of the Seven Heavens of the Western Direction, the Six Rong Elders and their officers, the Jade Maidens of the Great Simplicity, the Lads of Primordial Simplicity, and all the spirit officials of the Western Pole, from the Geng-Xin officials, along with the True [Officials] of Venus and the immortals and divine soldiers of the Western Marchmount, numbering seven hundred million myriad, to enter the Flowery Canopy Palace within the body of disciple [Name], to attend and guard the true scripture, that [Name] may eternally ascend to the Dao’s fruit. [Name] receives this.\n\nWe pray for the descent of the divine officials and retinue of the Five Heavens of the Northern Direction, the Five Di Qiang Elders and their officers, the Jade Maidens of the Great Mystery, the Lads of the Great Mystery, and all the spirit officials of the Northern Pole, from the Ren-Gui officials, along with the True [Officials] of Mercury and the immortals and divine soldiers of the Northern Marchmount, numbering five hundred million myriad, to enter the Great Granary Palace within the body of disciple [Name], to attend and guard the precious scripture, that [Name] may eternally ascend to the Dao’s fruit. [Name] receives this.\n\nWe pray for the descent of the scripture-attending immortals of the Supreme Ultimate, the attendants of the Great Mystery’s virtue/power, together with the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of Heaven and Earth, and the Three Ones’ scripture-attending officials, to enter the Three Primes Palace within the body of disciple [Name], to attend and serve the venerable scripture, that [Name] may eternally ascend to the Dao’s fruit. [Name] receives this.\n\nThe chant concluded, the disciple bows again.\nNext, chant to the Ten Directions.\n\nWith wholehearted devotion, I prostrate to the Boundless Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue in the East—one bow.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I prostrate to the Boundless Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue in the South—one bow.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I prostrate to the Boundless Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue in the West—one bow.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I prostrate to the Boundless Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue in the North—one bow.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I prostrate to the Boundless Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue in the Northeast—one bow.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I prostrate to the Boundless Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue in the Southeast—one bow.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I prostrate to the Boundless Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue in the Southwest—one bow.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I prostrate to the Boundless Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue in the Northwest—one bow.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I prostrate to the Boundless Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue in the Upper Realm—one bow.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I prostrate to the Boundless Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue in the Lower Realm—one bow.\n\nNext, the confession:\n\nDisciple of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Supreme Clarity and Mystic Capital, who performs the rites of transmission of the Dao and Virtue at [Name] Peak of [Name] Marchmount, the humble Perfected of Minor Fortune, your servant [Name], now reverently invokes the Most High, Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneously Realized Perfect Great Dao, the Supreme Heavenly Worthy; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Boundless Great Dao and the Host of Sages, the Heavenly Worthies of the Utmost Limit; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures and the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Center, the Most High Lord Lao; the Supreme Perfected Master Wen Shi; the Perfected of the Yellow River; the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate; the Left Immortal Duke of the Supreme Ultimate; the Three Perfected of the Mystic Unity; the Heavenly Master, the Lineage Master, and the Precept Master, the Three Masters; and all the host of sages throughout the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, who respond to conditions and proclaim transformation, whose numinous efficacy answers to devotion:\n\nYour servant, though most foolish, has presumptuously received the wondrous transformation, upholding the Great Dharma and transmitting the praise of the Three Worthies. My aspiration lies in establishing merit and broadly bestowing deliverance, that those who dwell in longing and yearning for the teaching may all enter the Dharma gate. Having received the numinous scripture, I dare not withhold or sever it; for all who seek and supplicate, it is difficult to refuse. We disciples [Names], with earnest sincerity and ardent devotion, aspire to cultivate and serve, ever advancing and never retreating, with courage, vigor, and diligence. Heart and spirit unite, cinnabar words and countenance both earnest; thus, in accordance with the regulations, we transmit and confer, pledging before the numinous ones of the Upper Realm and the Three Realms, humbly beseeching their witness and attestation.\n\nWe prostrate before the Perfect and Most True Sagely Heavenly Worthies of Dao and Virtue, the Five Emperors, the Four Offices, the Three Officials, and the host of sages, praying that you bestow the blessing of protection and the compassion of responsive grace. May you absolve your disciples [Names], our nine generations and seven lineages, our myriad ancestors of past kalpas, our Three Masters and their retinues, and ourselves, for the accumulated kalpas since we failed to awaken to the true Dao—our hidden sins and manifest transgressions, our faults in life and death, our karmic debts and former enmities, our long-standing and recent offenses, boundless and immeasurable—all of which we beseech you to dissolve and eradicate.\n\nGrant that our nine ancestors ascend to heaven, that our six relations share in fortune, that those in the Three Wretched Realms of the long night universally receive deliverance along with their enemies, that by this auspicious opportunity all may attain liberation. May the registers of the underworld be expunged, our names inscribed in the immortal records, our Dao practices elevated, our studies swiftly accomplished, our households flourishing, calamities and misfortunes pacified, the nation’s destiny prolonged, and the winds of the Dao spread afar.\n\nWe, who transmit the scriptures and confer the Dao, have acted contrary to the regulations in movement and stillness, accumulating myriad transgressions and faults—all of which we beg to be absolved. May all who hear the Great Dharma, all who possess the will, by the pervading power of your grace, find peace in both the manifest and hidden realms. We bow our heads in reverence and gratitude to the Ten Directions, prostrating to the Orthodox Three Treasures.\n\nNext, arise and circumambulate, reciting the *Hymn of Radiant Light* once, and the *Hymns to the Perfected* six times:\n\nTo establish merit, act early;\nTo study the Dao, do so now.\nDay and night, be diligent and earnest,\nResolve your intent, cast aside doubt.\nBurn incense and bow constantly,\nRecite scriptures and ever honor your master.\nWith courage and vigor, advance with diligence,\nDevoted and sincere, free from distracting thoughts.\nThe Four Immeasurables and the Six Perfections,\nThe Three Releases and the Five Feminine Powers.\nWash away dust and enter emptiness,\nWith an empty heart, maintain self-discipline.\nOnly seek unwavering progress,\nNot to be scorned by others.\nIf one can do thus,\nMorning and evening, one will ascend as an immortal.\n\nThough the Great Dao is without intent,\nIt may be sought with devotion.\nAwaiting the chariot in the empty cavern,\nTurning along the hidden paths of the azure flow.\nBeyond the Three Realms, in purity and brightness,\nRoaming the ethereal Jade Capital.\nWithout the mysterious impetus of fate,\nWho can awaken to the hidden truth?\nThe vast Milky Way, serene,\nGazing up and down, one finds emptiness and softness.\nThe Seven Mysteries scatter the dark night,\nReturning to the womb, following the ebb and flow.\nIf the hidden term is silently congealed,\nThe Yang tribulation holds no fear.\nBeholding these meetings of departure and return,\nWhy linger in delay?\nTranscending the body, yet the body remains—\nTrue immortals meet with worthy companions.\nAlternately tracing the mysteries within,\nThe limpid waves of the clear Han flow.\nChange and decay turn like a wheel,\nYet the tree’s boughs remain unchanged.\nWith a tranquil heart, contemplate the Perfect,\nFollow the course, comply with separation and union.\nResponse and resonance are ever connected,\nThe spirit’s ease reaches back to its origin.\nWandering in stillness, boundless,\nProlific thoughts penetrate the Nine Distances.\nFlying roots scatter the leaves of mystery,\nThe principle returns—there is nothing else.\nEver recite the jade verses,\nThe numinous sound pierces the clouds and rosy dawn.\nWhen the Jia-Shen calamity arrives,\nSoar on wings to the Queen Mother’s abode.\nEternally enjoy without end,\nWho knows the multitude of kalpas?\nIn the Seven Jeweled Grove of the Mystic Capital,\nThe Ten Flowers merge with the Miasma.\nPurple mist crowns the numinous radiance,\nThe cloud capital adorns the jade slopes.\nAbove stands the Hall of Blessings and Virtue,\nPalaces and chambers intermingle.\nAll are the faithful and devout,\nTrue immortals, soaring celestial families.\nThe Three Realms open the path of mystery,\nThe Five Paths are pure and free from deviation.\nGood conditions arise from the root,\nAccumulating merit brings abundant fortune.\nDrawn together, they follow in succession—\nThe Great Dharma is truly not in vain.\nThere are no ten-thousand-year mortals,\nAll share the same origin as the kalpa.\nIn this joyous world, so gentle,\nWords become songs of praise.\nThis world’s joy is boundless—\nWhat will the coming fate bring?\nThe Eight Observations arise from the gate of conditions,\nSin and fortune emerge from within.\nAt times, one sees the devoted,\nReflecting and awakening to the numinous.\nFor this reason, I now\nReveal the true and wondrous scripture.\nAs spoken in the scripture,\nRemembering the kalpas, all receive glory.\nPractice the Dao, uphold exhortations,\nBy the scripture, deliver this form.\nContemplate the roots of past lives,\nWash away and liberate the infant of former selves.\nTranscend and pass beyond the Three Nets,\nThe Eight Difficulties thus obscured.\n\nThe soul returns to its settled essence,\nThe spirit grasps from this its glory.\nExtinction and deliverance are like shedding a husk,\nVast and bright, one beholds the Eight Pures.\nTurning the Wheel, one attains divine transcendence,\nThrough my refinement of the heart’s essence.\nReceiving retribution without limit,\nWith resolve fixed, one enters the Garden of Fortune.\nThe seventy-two marks of excellence\nAll shine forth from within the body.\nThe nape bears the radiance of the Seven Treasures,\nIlluminating the forms of all heavens.\nSwift as the eight-scene chariot’s petals,\nThe wind circles the green-fringed disk.\nAscending into the Gate of the Profound Profound,\nOne awaits joy unending.\nWondrous communion transforms my spirit,\nVast and universal, its boundless merit.\nThe Dao accomplished at heaven and earth’s inception,\nThe Wheel’s transformations unfold through the ninefold.\nExtinction and deliverance traverse life and death,\nEach encounter with conditions has its origin.\nWho awakens to the suffering of going and coming?\nForm and soul have no beginning or end.\nAccumulating goodness exalts the foundation of fortune,\nThe body is delivered from the blade of the Five Difficulties.\nFreed from the Three Evil Paths,\nOne enters the tranquil hall with ease.\nContemplating deliverance across boundless realms,\nResolute thought evokes divine communion.\nThe Dharma conveys threefold revolutions,\nAiding my attainment of lofty transcendence.\nTurning my great pillar-step,\nI soar aloft to the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nUpon the completion of each chapter’s praise, all officials chant the Rite of Goodness and bow once. Then the master returns to his position, gives thanks, and utters the words of merit and gratitude:\n\nThe Most High Cavern of the Three Luminaries of the Mystic Capital, Disciple of the Supreme Three Caverns, Dharma Master of the Unsurpassed Three Caverns, upholding the Dao and its virtue, having received transmission of the Purple Void’s rites, the Master of Such-and-Such Peak and Such-and-Such Emperor, this humble Perfected of the Lesser Luminance, your servant So-and-So, bows twice and respectfully addresses the Most High, Limitless, Perfectly Real, Supreme, Unconditioned Great Dao, the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue; the Highest Lord Lao of the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures and the Great Dharma of the Mystic Center; the Perfected of the River’s Banks; the Master of Primordial Beginning; the host of great sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions; and all the perfected lords of the Three Realms within and beyond:\n\nBy the accumulation of my fortunate goodness, I have encountered this luminous destiny. The Three Caverns have extended their transformation, delivering gods and humans. I have been favored by my teachers and perfected ones, receiving the transmission of secret wonders, saving people and aiding the state, propagating the teachings and establishing merit. Yet I constantly fear that my strength is weak for so heavy a task, and I may fail in my duty. Thus, I wish to transmit this to later learners, broadly continuing the Dharma gate.\n\nYour disciples, So-and-So and others, with sincere devotion and earnest intent, have presented their words in faith, their resolve set on receiving and cultivating the teachings. Their humble sincerity cannot be refused. On such-and-such a day, in accordance with the codes of the Three Caverns, I have prepared the altar, revealed the petition, and entreated the perfected ones to descend and witness. May no obstacles arise, and may all accord with celestial rites. It seems fitting to transmit the teachings, and so, at this hour, the transmission is complete.\n\nFrom beginning to end, the celestial officials, inner and outer officers and soldiers, and all subordinate officials have labored, communicating petitions and providing protection. Each has fulfilled their duties. In accordance with the statutes of the Perfected, their merits shall be assessed and rewarded.\n\nIn my ignorance, the profound principles are difficult to fathom. I have erred in advancing and transgressed in retreating, accumulating a thousand faults and ten thousand sins. I humbly beg for forgiveness and permission to renew myself. May all officials and disciples be granted blessings and protection, their goodness resounding through the Three Realms, their fortune dispelling the Nine Shadows. May the Dao’s qi sustain them, and the perfected spirits assist them. May their cultivation of the Dao be fulfilled, and may they attain divine transcendence. May their seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and may the living and deceased alike receive grace. Should they remain in the world, may their fortune and emolument increase daily. May they become teachers of gods and humans, broadly propagating the Dao and benefiting all beings.\n\nThe Three and Five Perfected Officials within my body and those of your disciples, having completed their duties, now return to their palaces. I pray that the Most High, the Heavenly Worthies of Dao and Virtue, and all the revered ones will deign to accept this. As I now utter this petition, may it swiftly ascend. May you grant broad forgiveness. When the report is due, your servant So-and-So, with awe and reverence, bows twice to make this known.\n\nNext, the officers and soldiers are dismissed.\n\nThe transmission of the scriptures and rites being complete, the celestial officials, officers, soldiers, and functionaries who emerged from within my body, along with the lords of merit and messengers who oversaw and regulated the proceedings, shall return to their palaces. Let none be misplaced, so that when summoned again, they may arrive as before.\n\nThis done, strike the teeth and swallow the saliva three times each.\n\nNext, the incense burner is addressed:\n\nIncense Officials and Messengers, Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all spirit officials attending the incense: May this place of transmission naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the host of perfected spirits gather here before the incense and fire. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the fragrant smoke. May they convey all that I have petitioned directly to the Most High, Limitless, Jade Emperor before the Throne of the Perfected.\n\nEach bows three times.\n\nNext, the Hymn of Offering the Precepts is chanted.\n\nThe Precepts are the treasure of the body,\nThrough endless kalpas they bestow numinous destiny.\nWith empty heart one meets the void and stillness,\nThrough refined devotion and profound reflection.\n\nNine simurghs attend the jade chariot,\nEight phoenixes offer golden mushrooms.\nAzure youths sing wondrous melodies,\nMysterious maidens chant pure verses.\n\nDivine lords manifest radiant signs,\nThe Most High abides in profound tranquility.\nHeavenly blossoms mingle with rising incense,\nDharma rain scatters numinous essence.\n\nThrough diligent toil one cultivates the Dao of life,\nWith ardent longing one lays the foundation for transcendence.\nIf one’s sincerity never falters,\nThe crane-drawn chariot will surely come.\n\nNext, the Twelve Vows.\nNext, the Hymn to the Study of Transcendence.\nNext, exhaling at the door.\nNext, taking leave of the Three Masters.\nNext, with hymns of praise, leading to the Mysterious Master’s presence, dispersing according to the usual rites.\n\nAll spirit officials and disciples bow in gratitude and return to their positions.\n\nThree days after receiving the Dao, disciples shall come together to bow in thanksgiving and present a memorial of gratitude.\n\nFor disciples unaccustomed to ritual procedures, a supervising master shall perform the following on their behalf:\n\nDon the ritual vestments, arrange the incense and fire, and purify with ablutions. With hymns of praise, lead to the Earth Portal.\n\nNext, exhaling at the entrance, face left of the door, strike the teeth three times, and exhale, saying:\n\nThe Four Luminaries’ Merit Officers and Messengers of the Way to Perfection, the Jade Lads who transmit words, and the Jade Maidens who attend in stillness—let them announce to the presiding deities of the Dao chamber: may the Primordial Qi of the Upper Origin enter my body. When this is complete, advance with the left foot, then follow with the right to ascend the altar.\n\nNext, present incense at the imperial desk and exhale, saying:\nThis incense is the scattered radiance of jade blossoms, the congealed mist of the Nine Heavens. Its fragrant clouds weave a dense net, piercing straight through the Nine Heavens. May the true numina look down, may the immortals’ pendants approach the hall. The Golden Lad who attends the incense and the Jade Maiden who transmits words—convey this token incense to the presence of the Emperor on High. Let all that I now petition be granted as spoken.\n\nNext, each returns to their proper position and visualizes the deities. All disciples and officials close their eyes and envision: the Ten Mountains of the Mysterious Capital and the Three Venerables; the Perfected of the Ten Directions and the Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions; the thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures seated to the left of the Celestial Worthies; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center seated to the right; Lord Lao, the Perfected of the River’s Edge, and Master Yin dwelling in the midst of the Void and Nonexistence; the Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right, the Vermilion Bird in front, the Dark Warrior behind, guarding the four directions of the altar; thirty-six lions arrayed before the altar; the seven stars of the headscarf upon one’s own head; the five qi of the five viscera forming a net of luminous patterns covering the body; the Three Ones attending the scriptures, each with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders; the heavens and earth each with eighteen thousand Jade Lads and Jade Maidens guarding the body—all distinctly arrayed in full.\n\nNext, sound the Dharma drum thirty-six times.\nNext, open the incense burner.\n\nO Divine Perfected of the Five Elders of the Supreme Mystery and Primordial Origin, O Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Supreme Mystery who attend the incense to left and right, O Dragon-Tiger hosts of officials—we now report to the Supreme Mysterious Capital of the Great Lofty Heaven, the Jade Metropolis of the Supreme Mystery: having received the *Purple Void Treasure Record of the Venerable Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*, and with the three-day period now complete, we bow in memorial to give thanks. May the spontaneous and perfectly true qi descend and permeate our bodies. Let all that we now petition ascend directly to the presence of the August Emperor of the Jade Capital of the Boundless Dao.\n\nEach bows three times.\n\nNext, kneel upright and sound the Dharma drum thirty-six times, then dismiss the deities according to the proper method.\n\nWith reverence, we now send forth from our bodies the Merit Officers and Clerks of the Five Agents; the Officers of the Three Heavens who enforce the law and transform yin and yang; the twelve Officers who deliver the Dao, dispel calamities, scatter misfortunes, and resolve adversities; the twelve Officers who govern duties, the Great General who establishes standards and supervises merit; the vanguard who effect merit, the rearguard who effect execution; the Commandant and Vice-Commandant of the Post Stations; the Inspectors of Merit of the Four Quarters; the Direct Messengers of the Supreme Immortals and Supreme Numinous Ones, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers; the Left and Right Official Messengers; the Yin-Yang Deities of the Secondary Ranks; the Officers of the Chariot of Regulations; the Officers of the Rigorous Wind and Post Stations; the Officers who present memorials by post horse—two each.\n\nLet those who emerge be clad in solemn attire, their caps and sashes hanging with pendants, their majesty arrayed in full. The Direct Merit Officer wears the cap that reaches to Heaven, a black single-layered robe; the Orthodox Unity Merit Officer wears the accumulated cap of the Vermilion Yang, a crimson single-layered robe; the Messengers wear the Nine Virtues cap, a five-colored robe of longevity, their waists girded with tiger tallies, each holding a jade tablet. The Direct Merit Officer stands at the upper position; the Orthodox Unity Merit Officer stands at the center; the Merit Officer who tends to illnesses guards the body; the Left Official Messenger, bearing the standard, stands in front; the Right Official Messenger, holding the banner, stands behind; the Yang Deity of Decision stands to the left, the Yin Deity of Decision to the right; the Upper Merit Officer stands at the upper position; the Middle Merit Officer stands at the center of the body; the Qi-Urging Merit Officer hastens the ten directions; the Upper Messenger gazes afar to the heavens above; the Middle Messenger surveys the eight directions; the Capital Messenger encircles the body; the Captain of the Gentlemen of the Interior, the Tiger Warriors who detect treachery, the mounted archers, the Chief of the Capital Officials, the Armored Soldiers of Heaven, the Heavenly Ding Warriors, the Officers who gather qi and consume qi, the Officers who gather spirits and consume spirits, the Officers who gather ghosts and consume ghosts, the Officers who gather deviance and consume deviance, the Officers who gather essences and consume essences, the Officers who gather poisons and consume poisons, the Officers who execute talismans and destroy shrines, the Officers of the Chariot of Regulations and the Red Talismans, the Officers of the Rigorous Wind and Post Stations, the Officers who present memorials by post horse, the Officers of the Flying Dragon Cavalry—all take their stations before, behind, to the left, and to the right.\n\nWhen the Merit Officers and Messengers have completed their solemn preparations, they array their regalia and report to the Supreme Mystery.\n\nThe officials of the *Five Thousand Character Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*, the supervisors of the transcendents, the officers who oversee the fasts, the twenty-four districts established by the Heavenly Master, the thirty-six oratories of stillness, the seventy-two blessed lands, the three hundred sixty renowned mountains, the thirty-six thousand deities of the upper palaces of Kunlun and the like, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the Jade Armillary and Jade Balance, the Five Emperors of Heaven and Earth, the officials, generals, officers, and soldiers of the Three Realms, the Two Mysteries, the Three Origins, the Four Beginnings, the Four Quarters, the directional winds, the qi that infuses the stems and branches, the officers who examine and summon, the lords of the Nine Yi to the east, the Eight Man to the south, the Six Rong to the west, the Five Di to the north, the Three Qin in the center, the Hu, Yue, Yi, Qiang, and Cang peoples, the lords of the Five Peaks, the Four Waterways, the hills and marshes, the deities of all shrines, the lords of the high mountains, the mountains and rivers, the streams and valleys, the forests and groves, the Elders of the Mountains, the Twelve Stream Maidens, the original lords of the roots and origins, the officers of the altars of soil and grain—let all now don their solemn attire and, together with the Merit Officers, Messengers, and Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers within our bodies, ascend to report to the Supreme Venerable of the Boundless Dao, the Celestial Worthy of the Dao and Its Virtue; the thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the Most High Lord Lao; the Perfected of the River’s Edge; Master Wen Shi; all the great sages of the Three Realms and Ten Directions who have already attained the Dao; and the boundless numinous deities within and beyond heaven and earth:\n\nWe, though our karmic fortune spans kalpas, have been born to encounter the transformation of the Dao, the imperial transmission of the true scriptures, and the orthodox Dharma that delivers beings. We follow only what is good, never scorning the humble or base. Having now participated in the initial Dharma, we cultivate, uphold, and maintain it. On such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month of this year, we received from Master So-and-So at such-and-such an abbey the *Purple Void Treasure Record* bound with azure silk and golden cords, along with the *True Scripture* in its upper and lower parts, the *Master He’s Chapter and Verse*, the *Essential Precepts of Xiang’er*, the *Visualization Charts*, the *Transmission Secrets*, the *Court Rituals*, and the *Fasting Methods*. With the three-day period now complete, we bow in gratitude and present a vermilion memorial to ascend to the Nine Heavens. May the Merit Officers, Messengers, and Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers swiftly transmit and present it for inspection. We respectfully request that the memorial be reviewed.\n\nUpon opening the case to retrieve the memorial:\n\nNewly initiated disciples of the Most High Dao, the Lofty Mystery, and the Supreme Purple Void—your humble servants [Names]—prostrate ourselves twice and reverently address the Most High Mysterious Primordial Lord, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm, the Perfected of the River’s Shore, the Venerable Master of Literary Beginnings, and the Supreme Perfected beneath the Jade Tablet:\n\nWe, your servants, are of the lowest earth, utterly foolish, dust-like in insignificance, and base in station. Yet across countless kalpas and assemblies, we have still served the Dharma Gate. The wondrous Dao delivers all beings, and the Most High extends transformation—only goodness is bestowed, none are cast aside. In recent years, we have participated in and received the Orthodox Dharma. Now, by the grace of our true master, the Venerable Master of [Sacred Peak], we have been entrusted with the *Azure Silk and Golden Cords*, the *Venerable Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*, the *Secret Record of the Supreme Purple Void Celestial Writ*, the *Master He’s Chapter and Verse*, the *Essential Precepts of Xiang’er*, the *Visualization Charts*, the *Transmission Secrets*, the *Sublime and Wondrous True Scripture of the Western Ascension*, the *Six Jia Visualization Charts*, the *Jade Calendar of the Hidden Treasury*, the *Court Rituals*, and the *Fasting Methods*—all fully transmitted and conferred.\n\nReflecting on our own worthlessness—mere filth and vulgarity—we possess no heaven-endowed talent. Truly, we fear our cultivation and devotion may lack refinement, unworthy of bearing this burden. With trembling hearts, we examine ourselves, sweat mingling with dread, and vow to redouble our sincerity, forever pledging reverent adherence.\n\nWe humbly beseech the Perfected and Sages of the Highest Truth, the exalted and venerable of the Dao and its virtue, the majestic deities of the Three Caverns, and the officials of the Three Treasures: descend with true qi, bestow luminous numen, that our devotion may resonate and our merit be perfected. May demonic forces be subdued, the Dao’s transformation flourish, and our service to the state and salvation of beings be fulfilled. May the true spirits shelter and protect us, our merit and honor be shared, and may the nine generations of ancestors, the seven lineages, and all beings in the three paths and six destinies—wherever the divine power extends—all partake in blessed fortune.\n\nWith the three-day period now complete, we bow in gratitude and present a vermilion memorial to ascend to the Most High’s Court. We await the report with reverence. Your servants [Names], in utmost trepidation, prostrate ourselves twice, acknowledging our transgressions.\n\n---\n\n**Next: Three rounds of tooth-clicking to dispatch the memorial**\n\nYour servants, through the mediation of the Perfected and the Celestial Officials, the Merit Officers, and the Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers, separately submit and announce: having newly received the scriptures and methods, and with the three-day period fulfilled, we have, in accordance with the Dharma, bowed in gratitude and presented a vermilion memorial on yellow silk to ascend to the Heavenly Court. We, who have presumptuously participated in the register of governance, are dull of ear and blind of eye, our scrutiny lacking acuity. The memorial we submit may contain errors—its ranks disordered, its characters misaligned, omissions or inversions, phrases disjointed, front mistaken for back, left for right. May the yin-yang spirit officials and messengers convey our words, the scribal clerks and calligraphic attendants accompany the memorial for verification, the Dragon-Headed Writing Knife correct the text, and the long-bristled, sharp-tipped brush confirm its propriety. Let no overseeing celestial official overlook any detail. Seal the memorial and ascend it directly to the Jade Steps before the Most High’s Golden Gate in the Great Clarity. May the left and right clerks, in orderly succession, transmit it through the ranks of officials. Let our requests be granted, our summons answered, our salvations fulfilled, and our petitions reach their destination. Should any subordinate officials, wayward spirits, or demonic thieves obstruct the memorial’s path in the cloud routes, consign them to the nearest prison and punish them according to the celestial statutes, to uphold the heavenly decree. We, prostrate at the left of the tablet, await the response of the Mysterious Grace.\n\n---\n\n**Copying the memorial and presenting it to the immortal officials**\n\nRecite silently:\n*By the might of the Numinous Treasure Great Emperor,*\n*Descend swiftly from the Nine Heavens.*\n*At the Jade Emperor’s command,*\n*The cosmos trembles and the heavens manifest.*\n*Governing the northern quadrant,*\n*Commanding ghosts and immortals,*\n*Thousands upon thousands,*\n*Processions arrayed before me.*\n*Banners lowered, eyes closed,*\n*Fierce flames surge to the sky.*\n*Dare any obstruct my path,*\n*Or cast their gaze before me?*\n*Seized and executed, sent to the eternal dungeon.*\n*Every minor clerk, every divine immortal,*\n*Follows this memorial straight to the Emperor’s presence.*\n*Those who defy my command*\n*Shall be reported to the Three Heavens.*\n*Demons and drought spirits, bound and exiled,*\n*Driven to the demonic realms.*\n*The Four Numinous Beasts guard and protect,*\n*Never leaving my side.*\n*Sweep away demonic thieves,*\n*Perfect the merit and fruition.*\n*With the fast’s affairs concluded,*\n*Declare the merit resplendent in purple.*\n*Hasten! As the statutes decree!*\n\n*In the chaos of the Primordial Supreme,*\n*The Great Dao is boundless.*\n*The divine soldiers receive their orders,*\n*Soaring to seize and ascend to the Great Void.*\n\n**Conclude the memorial’s incineration, rise, and return the documents to the officials**\n\nThe memorial’s presentation is complete. The Merit Officers and all divine attendants who emerged from your servant’s body shall return through the Gates of Myriad Wonders—those on the left to the left, those on the right to the right. Let the Chief Merit Officer lead and oversee their return to the palace chambers, ensuring no errors. When summoned again, they shall return as before.\n\n---\n\n**The Twelve Vows**\n\nReplenish the incense burner. O Incense Officials, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant spirit officials: may this place of transmission naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred spirits and Perfected gather here before the incense and flame. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions guard the fragrant smoke, conveying all that your servant has petitioned directly to the Most High, the Boundless Jade Emperor.\n\n---\n\n**Exiting the Hall**\n\nThe rite of prostration and memorial presentation for the transmission of the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* and the *Purple Void* is now concluded.\n\n**#1** \"實\" should be an error for \"寶.\"\n**#2** Based on the preceding and following text, the character \"出\" is missing here.\n**#3** The wording of this passage appears to contain omissions or errors.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Three Caverns Transmission Ritual for the *Daoist Canon of the Purple Void* and *Laozi’s Scripture on the Dao and Its Virtue*, with Prostration Memorial Rites**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Three Caverns Transmission Ritual for the *Daoist Canon of the Purple Void* and *Laozi’s Scripture on the Dao and Its Virtue*, with Prostration Memorial Rites*\nCompiled by Du Guangting of the Late Tang. A ritual manual for the transmission of scriptures, precepts, and registers of the Great Mystery Division. One fascicle.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Cavern Spirit Division, *Ritual Propriety* category.\n\n**The Supreme Three Caverns Transmission Ritual for the *Daoist Canon of the Purple Void* and *Laozi’s Scripture on the Dao and Its Virtue*, with Prostration Memorial Rites**\nCompiled by Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting\n\nThe disciple, having heard the master’s precepts and completed the thanksgiving, rises and circumambulates leftward while reciting the *Eight Hymns of Penetrating the Mystery*:\n\nThe supreme Dao is ever void and quiescent,\nIts mysterious transformation responds to the essence of the Perfected.\nDispersing spirit, it pervades all things,\nCongealing radiance within the Three Clarities.\nFrom the dim and indistinct, forms arise;\nIn the empty and boundless, the formless is seen.\nFollowing the course of time, it unfolds the verdant assembly,\nAdapting to conditions, it expounds the wondrous scripture.\nCultivate it, and one ascends the River of Stars;\nNeglect it, and one falls into the dark prison.\nHeavenly maidens scatter golden blossoms,\nDivine youths chant jade-like tones.\nTen blossoms revolve the jeweled canopy,\nNine phoenixes halt the cloudy encampment.\nShould one propagate these supreme traces,\nAll within the realm and state will know peace.\n\nFive hundred million heavens,\nThree thousand realms of the Dao.\nRight and wrong ever await their turn,\nLife and death endlessly cycle.\nDelusion gives rise to the hells of greed and wrath,\nVanity constructs the palaces of killing and harm.\nFalsely asserting self and other as distinct,\nHow can one know their sameness?\nThe six senses are all unreal,\nThe myriad dharmas all return to emptiness.\nWhen afflictions are exhausted, the body dissolves;\nWhen mind and sense-dusts cease, so too does consciousness.\nUnable to seek liberation,\nOne remains ever confined in the dragon’s cage.\nIf one desires perpetual freedom,\nBow to the ancestral teaching of the supreme Dao.\n\nHeaven and hell,\nOrdinary beings and sages—\nAll arise from the square inch of the heart,\nNo other cause remains.\nAwakened, one becomes a companion of wisdom;\nDeluded, one dwells near the blind and foolish.\nSuffering souls still possess awareness,\nSinful spirits too retain their numinous essence.\nWhy sink into the mire of affliction?\nTruly, it stems from disbelief in the Real.\nAbandoning the treasure above this body,\nOne stains oneself with the dust of the mundane world.\nHaving drifted into the sea of transmigration,\nOne drowns again at the ford of death and rebirth.\nIf one wishes to cross this suffering,\nSit in stillness and contemplate this body.\n\nExcellent is the Venerable Primordial Beginning,\nCompassionately delivering all beings.\nVirtue extends beyond the void,\nMerit fills the realms as numerous as motes of dust.\nExpounding the Great Vehicle scriptures,\nIt engenders supreme wisdom.\nReversing the cycles of countless kalpas,\nIts teaching pervades the three times.\nEssence penetrates the realm of form,\nMystery exhausts the boundless immaterial.\nEvery region in every direction,\nThe Dao responds to every celestial sovereign.\nProvisional and absolute, it delivers gods and humans,\nAdapting its mechanism to the great and small.\nIts divine function is unfathomable,\nShaping all without exception.\n\nSin and blessing are like reflections in a mirror,\nLife and death like the turning of a wheel.\nObserve only what departs in the light,\nWho perceives what arrives in the dark?\nUnaspiring for the palaces of the Three Heavens,\nOne grieves only for the terraces of the Five Sufferings.\nWhen the sinful soul is spent by fate,\nThe dark spirit responds to the unfolding of conditions.\nEssence and qi disperse like floating wisps,\nThe bodily frame long since turned to ash.\nContent to become a ghostly form,\nWho remembers entering the immortal’s womb?\nVainly wishing for one’s name in the Azure Register,\nYet sorrowfully hastened by the Black Book.\nThe Dharma-wheel is rarely glimpsed again,\nThe long night is truly lamentable.\nThis body is most pitiable—\nAll should cultivate the Way of life.\n\nWho says the white jade fungus\nShades the golden herb?\nResolve to practice the Six Perfections,\nDevote the heart to the Three Treasures.\nThe White Prime descends to receive,\nThe Red Child is ever embraced.\nThough this withered age is late to learn,\nIn youth one must seize the moment.\nKnowing contentment, one is carefree;\nGreed for glory only brings vexation.\nSitting, one sees the humble hut as vast;\nIn stillness, one perceives heaven and earth as small.\nAbiding in the One without wavering,\nHow can one speak of aging through eternity?\n\nThree thousand worlds divided,\nFive hundred million heavens transformed.\nEach unfolds a pure realm,\nEvery region possesses its excellence.\nNinefold radiance births the courtyard grasses,\nSeven treasures fill the pond’s lotuses.\nTravelers’ lodges array the vermilion sun,\nFlying terraces reflect the purple springs.\nBurning incense are all jade maidens,\nExpounding the Dharma are only divine immortals.\nBrahmā’s chant summons the nine-crying phoenix,\nThe censer wafts five-colored smoke.\nBow to the palace of the Void Sovereign,\nSing praises before the Most High.\n\nBeware of neglecting past lives,\nOne must trust in the field of blessings.\nThe Dao’s transformation spreads through the Three Primes,\nThe divine congeals, dividing the ten thousand images.\nThe Dragon Han unfolds the mysterious register,\nCelestial script descends in the Crimson Nebula.\nResponding to the time, the Dharma-drum resounds,\nFollowing the direction, the wondrous gate opens.\nThe Most High bestows supreme traces,\nMajesty and virtue blanket heaven and earth.\nThe divine scripture attends the Three Ones,\nThe wondrous principle lies in the Five Thousand Characters.\nWords arrayed in the Golden Flower Palace,\nName transmitted by the Jade Emperor.\nWithin the heart, the sun of treasure arises;\nUpon the body, clouds of gauze ascend.\nWhat need for the Ten Immortals as companions?\nThrough kalpas uncounted, one abides forever.\n\nNext, the *Hymn for the Transmission of the Scripture* is sung.\nIf the *Eight Hymns of Penetrating the Mystery* are not recited in full, this hymn follows the second:\n\nSoaring beyond the Great Void’s peaks,\nFlowing radiance abides in the Supreme Mystery.\nBeginningless and endless through the kalpas,\nIt eternally preserves heaven, earth, and humankind.\nThe lord of the realm studies its governance,\nThe Daoist recites it to attain immortality.\nThe worthy now receive and uphold it,\nTransmitting it in accord with the Dharma.\nIn times lacking a child of utmost virtue,\nGuard its secrecy, do not recklessly proclaim it.\nUphold it, and ascend to the Great Clarity;\nAbandon it, and fall into the Nine Springs.\nI expound the Dao of non-action,\nThrough quiescence and emptiness, attain spontaneity.\n\nNext, the master returns to his original position. The disciples face south, kneel toward the north, and invoke the Five Numinous Guardians, each by name, to receive the transmission:\n\nYour servant now, on behalf of disciple [Name], [Official Title], transmits the register of the *Venerable Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue of the Purple Void*.

My aspiration lies in establishing merit and broadly bestowing deliverance, that those who dwell in longing and yearning for the teaching may all enter the Dharma gate. Having received the numinous scripture, I dare not withhold or sever it; for all who seek and supplicate, it is difficult to refuse. We disciples [Names], with earnest sincerity and ardent devotion, aspire to cultivate and serve, ever advancing and never retreating, with courage, vigor, and diligence. Heart and spirit unite, cinnabar words and countenance both earnest; thus, in accordance with the regulations, we transmit and confer, pledging before the numinous ones of the Upper Realm and the Three Realms, humbly beseeching their witness and attestation.\n\nWe prostrate before the Perfect and Most True Sagely Heavenly Worthies of Dao and Virtue, the Five Emperors, the Four Offices, the Three Officials, and the host of sages, praying that you bestow the blessing of protection and the compassion of responsive grace. May you absolve your disciples [Names], our nine generations and seven lineages, our myriad ancestors of past kalpas, our Three Masters and their retinues, and ourselves, for the accumulated kalpas since we failed to awaken to the true Dao—our hidden sins and manifest transgressions, our faults in life and death, our karmic debts and former enmities, our long-standing and recent offenses, boundless and immeasurable—all of which we beseech you to dissolve and eradicate.\n\nGrant that our nine ancestors ascend to heaven, that our six relations share in fortune, that those in the Three Wretched Realms of the long night universally receive deliverance along with their enemies, that by this auspicious opportunity all may attain liberation. May the registers of the underworld be expunged, our names inscribed in the immortal records, our Dao practices elevated, our studies swiftly accomplished, our households flourishing, calamities and misfortunes pacified, the nation’s destiny prolonged, and the winds of the Dao spread afar.\n\nWe, who transmit the scriptures and confer the Dao, have acted contrary to the regulations in movement and stillness, accumulating myriad transgressions and faults—all of which we beg to be absolved. May all who hear the Great Dharma, all who possess the will, by the pervading power of your grace, find peace in both the manifest and hidden realms. We bow our heads in reverence and gratitude to the Ten Directions, prostrating to the Orthodox Three Treasures.\n\nNext, arise and circumambulate, reciting the *Hymn of Radiant Light* once, and the *Hymns to the Perfected* six times:\n\nTo establish merit, act early;\nTo study the Dao, do so now.\nDay and night, be diligent and earnest,\nResolve your intent, cast aside doubt.\nBurn incense and bow constantly,\nRecite scriptures and ever honor your master.\nWith courage and vigor, advance with diligence,\nDevoted and sincere, free from distracting thoughts.\nThe Four Immeasurables and the Six Perfections,\nThe Three Releases and the Five Feminine Powers.\nWash away dust and enter emptiness,\nWith an empty heart, maintain self-discipline.\nOnly seek unwavering progress,\nNot to be scorned by others.\nIf one can do thus,\nMorning and evening, one will ascend as an immortal.\n\nThough the Great Dao is without intent,\nIt may be sought with devotion.\nAwaiting the chariot in the empty cavern,\nTurning along the hidden paths of the azure flow.\nBeyond the Three Realms, in purity and brightness,\nRoaming the ethereal Jade Capital.\nWithout the mysterious impetus of fate,\nWho can awaken to the hidden truth?\nThe vast Milky Way, serene,\nGazing up and down, one finds emptiness and softness.\nThe Seven Mysteries scatter the dark night,\nReturning to the womb, following the ebb and flow.\nIf the hidden term is silently congealed,\nThe Yang tribulation holds no fear.\nBeholding these meetings of departure and return,\nWhy linger in delay?\nTranscending the body, yet the body remains—\nTrue immortals meet with worthy companions.\nAlternately tracing the mysteries within,\nThe limpid waves of the clear Han flow.\nChange and decay turn like a wheel,\nYet the tree’s boughs remain unchanged.\nWith a tranquil heart, contemplate the Perfect,\nFollow the course, comply with separation and union.\nResponse and resonance are ever connected,\nThe spirit’s ease reaches back to its origin.\nWandering in stillness, boundless,\nProlific thoughts penetrate the Nine Distances.\nFlying roots scatter the leaves of mystery,\nThe principle returns—there is nothing else.\nEver recite the jade verses,\nThe numinous sound pierces the clouds and rosy dawn.\nWhen the Jia-Shen calamity arrives,\nSoar on wings to the Queen Mother’s abode.\nEternally enjoy without end,\nWho knows the multitude of kalpas?\nIn the Seven Jeweled Grove of the Mystic Capital,\nThe Ten Flowers merge with the Miasma.\nPurple mist crowns the numinous radiance,\nThe cloud capital adorns the jade slopes.\nAbove stands the Hall of Blessings and Virtue,\nPalaces and chambers intermingle.\nAll are the faithful and devout,\nTrue immortals, soaring celestial families.\nThe Three Realms open the path of mystery,\nThe Five Paths are pure and free from deviation.\nGood conditions arise from the root,\nAccumulating merit brings abundant fortune.\nDrawn together, they follow in succession—\nThe Great Dharma is truly not in vain.\nThere are no ten-thousand-year mortals,\nAll share the same origin as the kalpa.\nIn this joyous world, so gentle,\nWords become songs of praise.\nThis world’s joy is boundless—\nWhat will the coming fate bring?\nThe Eight Observations arise from the gate of conditions,\nSin and fortune emerge from within.\nAt times, one sees the devoted,\nReflecting and awakening to the numinous.\nFor this reason, I now\nReveal the true and wondrous scripture.\nAs spoken in the scripture,\nRemembering the kalpas, all receive glory.\nPractice the Dao, uphold exhortations,\nBy the scripture, deliver this form.\nContemplate the roots of past lives,\nWash away and liberate the infant of former selves.\nTranscend and pass beyond the Three Nets,\nThe Eight Difficulties thus obscured.",

The Three Caverns have extended their transformation, delivering gods and humans. I have been favored by my teachers and perfected ones, receiving the transmission of secret wonders, saving people and aiding the state, propagating the teachings and establishing merit. Yet I constantly fear that my strength is weak for so heavy a task, and I may fail in my duty. Thus, I wish to transmit this to later learners, broadly continuing the Dharma gate.\n\nYour disciples, So-and-So and others, with sincere devotion and earnest intent, have presented their words in faith, their resolve set on receiving and cultivating the teachings.

It seems fitting to transmit the teachings, and so, at this hour, the transmission is complete.\n\nFrom beginning to end, the celestial officials, inner and outer officers and soldiers, and all subordinate officials have labored, communicating petitions and providing protection. Each has fulfilled their duties. In accordance with the statutes of the Perfected, their merits shall be assessed and rewarded.\n\nIn my ignorance, the profound principles are difficult to fathom. I have erred in advancing and transgressed in retreating, accumulating a thousand faults and ten thousand sins. I humbly beg for forgiveness and permission to renew myself. May all officials and disciples be granted blessings and protection, their goodness resounding through the Three Realms, their fortune dispelling the Nine Shadows. May the Dao’s qi sustain them, and the perfected spirits assist them. May their cultivation of the Dao be fulfilled, and may they attain divine transcendence. May their seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and may the living and deceased alike receive grace. Should they remain in the world, may their fortune and emolument increase daily. May they become teachers of gods and humans, broadly propagating the Dao and benefiting all beings.\n\nThe Three and Five Perfected Officials within my body and those of your disciples, having completed their duties, now return to their palaces. I pray that the Most High, the Heavenly Worthies of Dao and Virtue, and all the revered ones will deign to accept this. As I now utter this petition, may it swiftly ascend. May you grant broad forgiveness. When the report is due, your servant So-and-So, with awe and reverence, bows twice to make this known.\n\nNext, the officers and soldiers are dismissed.\n\nThe transmission of the scriptures and rites being complete, the celestial officials, officers, soldiers, and functionaries who emerged from within my body, along with the lords of merit and messengers who oversaw and regulated the proceedings, shall return to their palaces.

When this is complete, advance with the left foot, then follow with the right to ascend the altar.\n\nNext, present incense at the imperial desk and exhale, saying:\nThis incense is the scattered radiance of jade blossoms, the congealed mist of the Nine Heavens. Its fragrant clouds weave a dense net, piercing straight through the Nine Heavens. May the true numina look down, may the immortals’ pendants approach the hall. The Golden Lad who attends the incense and the Jade Maiden who transmits words—convey this token incense to the presence of the Emperor on High. Let all that I now petition be granted as spoken.\n\nNext, each returns to their proper position and visualizes the deities.

      "translated_text": "Upon opening the case to retrieve the memorial:\n\nNewly initiated disciples of the Most High Dao, the Lofty Mystery, and the Supreme Purple Void—your humble servants [Names]—prostrate ourselves twice and reverently address the Most High Mysterious Primordial Lord, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm, the Perfected of the River’s Shore, the Venerable Master of Literary Beginnings, and the Supreme Perfected beneath the Jade Tablet:\n\nWe, your servants, are of the lowest earth, utterly foolish, dust-like in insignificance, and base in station. Yet across countless kalpas and assemblies, we have still served the Dharma Gate. The wondrous Dao delivers all beings, and the Most High extends transformation—only goodness is bestowed, none are cast aside. In recent years, we have participated in and received the Orthodox Dharma. Now, by the grace of our true master, the Venerable Master of [Sacred Peak], we have been entrusted with the *Azure Silk and Golden Cords*, the *Venerable Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*, the *Secret Record of the Supreme Purple Void Celestial Writ*, the *Master He’s Chapter and Verse*, the *Essential Precepts of Xiang’er*, the *Visualization Charts*, the *Transmission Secrets*, the *Sublime and Wondrous True Scripture of the Western Ascension*, the *Six Jia Visualization Charts*, the *Jade Calendar of the Hidden Treasury*, the *Court Rituals*, and the *Fasting Methods*—all fully transmitted and conferred.\n\nReflecting on our own worthlessness—mere filth and vulgarity—we possess no heaven-endowed talent. Truly, we fear our cultivation and devotion may lack refinement, unworthy of bearing this burden. With trembling hearts, we examine ourselves, sweat mingling with dread, and vow to redouble our sincerity, forever pledging reverent adherence.\n\nWe humbly beseech the Perfected and Sages of the Highest Truth, the exalted and venerable of the Dao and its virtue, the majestic deities of the Three Caverns, and the officials of the Three Treasures: descend with true qi, bestow luminous numen, that our devotion may resonate and our merit be perfected. May demonic forces be subdued, the Dao’s transformation flourish, and our service to the state and salvation of beings be fulfilled. May the true spirits shelter and protect us, our merit and honor be shared, and may the nine generations of ancestors, the seven lineages, and all beings in the three paths and six destinies—wherever the divine power extends—all partake in blessed fortune.\n\nWith the three-day period now complete, we bow in gratitude and present a vermilion memorial to ascend to the Most High’s Court. We await the report with reverence. Your servants [Names], in utmost trepidation, prostrate ourselves twice, acknowledging our transgressions.\n\n---\n\n**Next: Three rounds of tooth-clicking to dispatch the memorial**\n\nYour servants, through the mediation of the Perfected and the Celestial Officials, the Merit Officers, and the Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers, separately submit and announce: having newly received the scriptures and methods, and with the three-day period fulfilled, we have, in accordance with the Dharma, bowed in gratitude and presented a vermilion memorial on yellow silk to ascend to the Heavenly Court. We, who have presumptuously participated in the register of governance, are dull of ear and blind of eye, our scrutiny lacking acuity. The memorial we submit may contain errors—its ranks disordered, its characters misaligned, omissions or inversions, phrases disjointed, front mistaken for back, left for right. May the yin-yang spirit officials and messengers convey our words, the scribal clerks and calligraphic attendants accompany the memorial for verification, the Dragon-Headed Writing Knife correct the text, and the long-bristled, sharp-tipped brush confirm its propriety. Let no overseeing celestial official overlook any detail. Seal the memorial and ascend it directly to the Jade Steps before the Most High’s Golden Gate in the Great Clarity. May the left and right clerks, in orderly succession, transmit it through the ranks of officials. Let our requests be granted, our summons answered, our salvations fulfilled, and our petitions reach their destination. Should any subordinate officials, wayward spirits, or demonic thieves obstruct the memorial’s path in the cloud routes, consign them to the nearest prison and punish them according to the celestial statutes, to uphold the heavenly decree. We, prostrate at the left of the tablet, await the response of the Mysterious Grace.\n\n---\n\n**Copying the memorial and presenting it to the immortal officials**\n\nRecite silently:\n*By the might of the Numinous Treasure Great Emperor,*\n*Descend swiftly from the Nine Heavens.*\n*At the Jade Emperor’s command,*\n*The cosmos trembles and the heavens manifest.*\n*Governing the northern quadrant,*\n*Commanding ghosts and immortals,*\n*Thousands upon thousands,*\n*Processions arrayed before me.*\n*Banners lowered, eyes closed,*\n*Fierce flames surge to the sky.*\n*Dare any obstruct my path,*\n*Or cast their gaze before me?*\n*Seized and executed, sent to the eternal dungeon.*\n*Every minor clerk, every divine immortal,*\n*Follows this memorial straight to the Emperor’s presence.*\n*Those who defy my command*\n*Shall be reported to the Three Heavens.*\n*Demons and drought spirits, bound and exiled,*\n*Driven to the demonic realms.*\n*The Four Numinous Beasts guard and protect,*\n*Never leaving my side.*\n*Sweep away demonic thieves,*\n*Perfect the merit and fruition.*\n*With the fast’s affairs concluded,*\n*Declare the merit resplendent in purple.*\n*Hasten! As the statutes decree!*\n\n*In the chaos of the Primordial Supreme,*\n*The Great Dao is boundless.*\n*The divine soldiers receive their orders,*\n*Soaring to seize and ascend to the Great Void.*\n\n**Conclude the memorial’s incineration, rise, and return the documents to the officials**\n\nThe memorial’s presentation is complete. The Merit Officers and all divine attendants who emerged from your servant’s body shall return through the Gates of Myriad Wonders—those on the left to the left, those on the right to the right. Let the Chief Merit Officer lead and oversee their return to the palace chambers, ensuring no errors. When summoned again, they shall return as before.\n\n---\n\n**The Twelve Vows**\n\nReplenish the incense burner. O Incense Officials, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant spirit officials: may this place of transmission naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred spirits and Perfected gather here before the incense and flame. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions guard the fragrant smoke, conveying all that your servant has petitioned directly to the Most High, the Boundless Jade Emperor.\n\n---\n\n**Exiting the Hall**\n\nThe rite of prostration and memorial presentation for the transmission of the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* and the *Purple Void* is now concluded.",
