  "full_translation": "**The Song of Great Victory**\n\n**Text Title:** *The Song of Great Victory*\nAuthored by Liu Kunyong, composed during the Five Dynasties and Northern Song period. One fascicle.\nBase text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section of the Divine Cavern (Dongshenbu)*.\n\n**The Song of Great Victory**\nBy Liu Chongyong, Supreme Clarity Daoist of the Great Cavern, styled Xuanningzi\n\nMaster Tao [Hongjing]’s *Three Treatises* states: \"To transmute mercury into golden elixir is the talk of fools; to claim cinnabar can prolong life is the folly of those ignorant of the Dao. Mercury does not occupy the proper position within the Five Phases, nor does cinnabar embody the union of Dragon and Tiger. To regard mercury as the essence of the Returned Elixir is as absurd as plowing stone to plant rice.\"\n\nThe *Master Embracing Simplicity* clings to the secrets of the Two Mountains and the origins of lead and mercury, expounding them with earnest clarity, yet the deluded persist in their ignorance until death. The *Scripture of the Primordial Origin* invokes the mutual conquest of the Five Phases, which become father and mother—this illuminates the Dao of Heaven and Earth. The *Scripture of the Golden and Azure* states that metal and earth are paired, as does the *Can Tong Qi*, offering irrefutable evidence and guidance free from obscurity.\n\nNow, Dragon and Tiger are the axle and pivot of yin and yang, the hinge of creation. Though called Kan and Li, they are in truth Heaven and Earth. Through hardness subduing softness, from non-being entering being, the Five Phases follow their sequence, each attaining its proper place. In their pairing, east and west unite; once the singular qi divides, the Three Powers stand arrayed, the Six Lines unfold in succession, and the Four Images are fully manifested. Thus may cinnabar be refined—yet this Dao is profound and subtle, rarely fathomed by the world.\n\nAs the *Can Tong Qi* says:\n*\"Use metal as a dike to contain the waters, which then flow with ease.\nFifteen parts of metal, fifteen of water—\nWeigh them precisely at the furnace, with water slightly in excess.\nThree parts remain unabsorbed, two parts merge with it.\"*\n\nThese lines are the guiding principles of the Great Medicine, the pivot of metal and water. Yet people fail to grasp their meaning, instead pursuing cunning artifices, following their own whims, clinging to texts without a teacher, and thus never attaining the truth. How lamentable!\n\nAn ancient song declares:\n*\"Beneath the First Green, moon and sun,\nTwo halves ascend and merge as one.\"*\n\nThe world does not understand this principle. Some refine mercury with cinnabar, or extract mercury from cinnabar, subjecting it to countless cycles of heating and sublimation, reducing it to ash and smoke—how then can it return to its original state? Is this not folly?\n\nThe *Great Simplicity* states: *\"Two maidens dwell together, yet their aspirations differ.\"* This refers to their positions. The north, Kan, is yin, which returns to become yang; the south, Li, is yang, which submits to become yin. Within the sun is the crow; within the moon, the toad. The crow is the essence of yin, wholly returning to yang—thus it is said, *\"It gives birth to boys, not girls,\"* which is self-evident.\n\nAll fruits arise from the tiniest beginnings, growing and ripening until they bear their essence. The tree knows not its own fruit—this is the work of nature. The *Diagram of the Great Simplicity* states: *\"Wherever yin and yang exist, there arise people, beasts, grasses, and trees.\"* If mercury and cinnabar are said to originate in Ba and Shu, then in places where they do not appear, there should be no people, beasts, grasses, or trees. By this comparison, is this not foolish?\n\nMercury and cinnabar possess a natural origin, incomprehensible to ordinary minds, endlessly transforming in ways beyond human reason. The sages often borrow the names of metals and minerals to describe them. Kan (Water) presides over the seventy-two minerals—how could this be? A song says: *\"Without the male, the female arises of itself\"*—does this not convey the truth? If one uses mercury and cinnabar, they vanish at the first touch of fire—how can they be contained? Even if refined into a solid form, their essence is lost, devoid of the path of growth and return—how could they achieve immortality? Like mist scattering in wind and rain, or rivers flowing through a hundred channels, they stray from the Way.\n\nThe scriptures say: *\"Master one, and ten thousand affairs are complete,\"* and *\"Having attained the One, do not cling to it.\"* In the profound and obscure, there is essence; in the indistinct and vague, there is substance. *\"Mysterious and yet more mysterious\"*—this is the foundation of embodying the Dao.\n\nEach is one or two, interwoven with the Five Phases, the work of wu and ji. The beauty of lead is praised, yet its meaning is difficult to fathom. The *Can Tong Qi* says: *\"Like the Milky Way’s stars, a hundred rivers flow to the sea\"*—the world cannot comprehend this. The *Song of the Primordial Lord* declares:\n*\"Five internal measures, patterns hidden in vines,\nRed salt and white snow form male and female—\nThe true return lies here, yet none perceive it.\"*\n\nThus, one need not seek cinnabar or mercury. Know that the myriad things arise from a single qi, and the Three Powers are nurtured by the myriad things.\n\nAnother song says: *\"The loss of the One Black is like shards of tile.\"* This speaks of the affairs within the crucible, not external matters.\n\nIn my youth, I studied the Confucian and Mohist teachings; in maturity, I pursued the mysteries of the Dao. By chance, in seeking remedies for illness, I came near the path of longevity. Though I fulfilled my duties in the vermilion halls and briefly enjoyed the honor of the crimson sash, I abandoned these to devote myself to study and expound upon the Great Medicine. I delved into its essence and explored its profound subtleties. Having encountered an enlightened teacher, I received the transmission of its essential wonders—this is no falsehood. Thus, I composed *The Song of Great Victory* in ten stanzas, which sing of the marvels of lead, mercury, and the Five Phases. May later scholars use it to dispel their delusions.\n\n**I.**\nFrom whence do the Nine Cauldrons arise?\nAll from the One Black’s birth.\nWhen silver and lead find their place,\nDragon and Tiger naturally merge.\nWeigh them in scruples and grains,\nDiscern the River Chariot’s nature.\nFollow the seasons in sequence,\nAnd the Returned Elixir may be achieved.\n\n**II.**\nTortoise and snake differ in form,\nYet lead and mercury share a common ancestor.\nThough the two maidens dwell together,\nA good matchmaker distinguishes mother and child.\nTheir union depends on the Three Flowers—\nThe Azure Dragon and White Tiger in verse.\nOnce the Four Images are established,\nThe Five Spirits find their master.\n\n**III.**\nMajestic and towering, yet lofty,\nDrifting and turning, why glance aside?\nThe world merely refines elixirs,\nUnknowing of the immortal’s path.\n\n**IV.**\nAll stones belong to the Kan Palace,\nYet under borrowed names, none awaken.\nBlack and white unknown,\nThe passing years drift in vain.\n\n**V.**\nAll speak of water, earth, and metal—\nThese three become the great medicine.\nBorrowed qi gives rise in succession,\nRising and fusing in turn.\nThe Yellow Sprout is not lead,\nYet arises within lead itself.\nOnce gathered, it unites with the West,\nWhile Wu and Ji are cast aside as husks.\n\n**VI.**\nTwo eights form two households,\nThe mid-crescent counters the two eights.\nThus we know within Heaven and Earth,\nYin and yang govern the pivot.\nThe child is born of the mother,\nThe mother is slain by the child.\nNurture the essence of the infant,\nTemper its warmth to guard against excess.\nEach full moon takes form,\nYet withdrawal and replenishment must pause.\nWhen Ren and Zi give birth to the mighty Yang,\nFollowing the cycle, it perishes at Hai.\nShould you know the time of transcendence,\nDivine talismans and white snow await.\n\n**VII.**\nTo refine the true and temper the form, hold fast to the One.\nA single misstep, and the furnace is lost.\nFirst use Ren and Zi to restrain the hooves,\nLest you cling instead to the Fusang sun.\nOnly when flavor yields to formlessness\nCan you preserve the primal harmony of Heaven’s nature.\nSeek no matchmaker elsewhere—\nHusband and wife are ever paired.\nFrom this, horse-teeth surpass langgan,\nWaxing and waning, dark and bright—mark their swiftness or slowness.\nThus we know East and West define the round and square,\nYet mortals idly boast of wondrous arts.\n\n**VIII.**\nThe Water Mother and Metal Father are not easily known,\nTransforming into flowing pearls, their radiance shifts to ochre.\nIf borrowed qi reaches the White Snow Palace,\nThe Yellow Sprout from hence becomes hard to fathom.\nGuard firmly against half-submerged perils,\nLest the grieving maiden’s lament linger in vain.\n\n**IX.**\nAncient poems and songs make all plain,\nYet deluded men force their own interpretations.\nThe supreme Dao is not so very complex,\nYet they recklessly entwine cinnabar and mercury.\nUnknowing of crimson blood and azure waist,\nAll day they labor within lead.\nWhat lies within lead is not easily cultivated—\nLose it, and the primal qi severs without end.\n\n**X.**\nThe Yellow Sprout is not lead,\nThe two substances birth the cinnabar field.\nShould you seek the mighty Yang’s method,\nLead and mercury must arise naturally.\nNone of this exists in the world’s domain,\nNor does it distinguish fool from sage.\nSun’s essence and moon’s radiance—\nThose who recognize them are all immortals.\n\n**XI.**\nThe Daoist of Great Origin was once a divine immortal,\nWho shifted his name to the Central Metropolis to study spontaneity.\nWorldly men refine elixirs, deluded by metal and water,\nBurning through the Yellow Sprout yet failing to know lead.\nIn Western Shu, men vie to gather mercury,\nYet with fire, it vanishes in an instant as smoke.\nIf you can grasp the One without clinging to it,\nThe wondrous method is profound, ever more profound.\n\n*The Mighty Yang Song concludes.*",

      "original_text": "巨胜歌 经名：巨胜歌。 柳坤用撰，出矜五代北宋时期。 一卷。 底本出处：《 正统道藏》洞神部。 巨胜歌 玄明子上清大洞道士柳冲用 《陶真君三篇》 云：以水银为金丹者，妄人言也； 朱砂可以驻年者，不知道人也。 且水银非五行正位，朱砂非龙虎配合，若以水银为还丹之要，可以耕石而植稻耳。 死抱朴子以二山之秘，铅汞之源，晓论丁宁，迷者至死不悟。 《混元经》 引五行相克，更为父母，此盖明乾坤之道。 《金碧经》 云金土相配，《参同》 亦然，引验至明，指示不昧。 且龙虎者，阴阳之轴辖，造化之枢机，虽日坎离，实亦天地。 以刚伏柔，从无入有，五行节序，各得其位。 在於配匹，举束合西，一气既分，三才并列，六爻递设，四象具陈。 然可伏炼丹砂，斯道玄微，世人罕测。 只如《参同》 云：以金为堤防，水入乃优游。 金计有十五，水数亦如之。 临炉定铢两，五分水有余。 其三遂不入，水二与之俱。 此数句是大药之纲纪，如金水枢柄。 人皆不晓是道，但穿寻巧谲，自率胸襟，无师执文，终无得理。 诚所哀哉！ ．且古歌云：始青之下月与日，两半同升合为一。 举世不知此义，但伏汞与砂，不然则取朱砂中水银，多门燠伏，变为烟烬，何由还返？ 不亦谬哉！ ．太易云：二女同居，其志不相得。 是即位而居也。 北方坎是阴，返而归阳，南方离是阳，伏而为阴。 日中之有乌，月中之有蟾。 乌者阴精，都归其阳，故曰生男不生女，明矣！ 大凡果实因毫末而生，长而秀，终得其实，实之於树，树亦不知，是为自然。 《太易图》 云：凡有阴阳，即生人民禽兽草木。 若以水银朱砂产於巴蜀，其不出水银朱砂处，即不合有人民禽兽草木也。 以此方之，不亦愚乎！ ．水银朱砂有自然之者，非世人可解，千变万化，难穷乎理。 圣人多借金石以名之，坎居七十二石之长，何由之？ 歌云：不用雄兮自有黄，是此义也？ 若用水银朱砂，见火即飞，何门可住？ 纵伏火以为坚质，本亦不存，无生长还返之道，那肯致焉？ 又以雾散若风雨，川流百脉，即乖矣！ ．经一不．得一万事毕，又云得一莫执一。 杳杳冥冥，其中有精； 恍恍惚惚，其中有物。 玄之又玄，体道之宗。 是各一二，参及五行，戊己之功。 叹铅之美，实难明解。 《 参同》 云：有若汉经星，百川流带海。 举世不可知之。 《 元君歌》 日：五内斤两文藏萝，赤盐白雪成雄雌，真还在此人不知。 即应不用人问朱砂水银，乃知万物因一气而生，三才因万物所育。 又歌云．．一黑所失，犹如瓦砾。 此论鼎内之事，非外旨也。 余少亲儒墨，长学玄风，偶因求痪之余，近得长生之道。 虽尽彤檐之任，有暂朱绶之荣，辄以护学，将论大药。 穷其精实，究以玄微。 曾遇明师，获传要妙，固非谬妄，演道贤良。 为《 巨胜歌》十首，其问歌咏铅汞五行之妙，后来学者，用桔迷惑云尔。 其一 九鼎何所自，都因一黑生。 银铅看得所，龙虎自吞并。 铢两相句制，河车辨性情。 循还依节候，还丹应可成。 其二 龟蛇体殊异，铅汞共宗祖。 二女虽同居，良媒分子母。 配合由三花，青龙句白虎。 四象既可凭，五神当有主。 其三 巍巍尊复高，飘飘何左顾。 世人徒炼丹，不识神仙路。",
