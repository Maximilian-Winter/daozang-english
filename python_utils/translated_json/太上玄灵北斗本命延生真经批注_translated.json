  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Original Destiny Life-Prolonging Perfected Scripture with Commentary**\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the Supreme Mysterious Numinous Original Destiny Life-Prolonging Perfected Scripture*. Originally attributed to the Perfected One of Mystic Origin of Mount Kongtong, likely composed by a Daoist of the Song or Yuan dynasties. Falsely ascribed prefaces by Li Bai and Su Shi. The commentary centers on the cultivation of mind and nature. Three fascicles. Base text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Wondrous Writings* section, *Jade Instructions* category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the Scripture of Prolonging Life through the Northern Dipper**\n\nOf old, before the Great Simplicity divided, there was neither light nor form. The undifferentiated yellow evolved into transformation, having beginning and end. Thus, the pure ascends while the turbid lingers; goodness is aided while evil is suppressed. A hundred and twenty bureaus were established and arrayed in the netherworld. Thirty-six scriptures were composed and concealed in the Jasper Palace, to deliver those of the Dao among heavenly beings and enlighten the unenlightened among sentient beings. I sigh and say: Is this not the guiding principle of the Three Realms and Ten Directions, the order of Heaven, Earth, and humanity?\n\nNow, in this sagely age, we are blessed with abundant years and have encountered the imperial dynasty, which governs the realm with virtue and pacifies the household, achieving illustrious merit and nurturing the common people. Moreover, the world is at peace, and the Supreme Mystery shines forth. Thus, those of Daoist aspiration—such as the disciples of the Feng clan—renew their vows daily, longing for the truth through the years. They pray to Heaven for protection against malevolent forces and seek the teachings of masters to transmit the essentials of the Dao. Thereupon, they encountered the Perfected One of Mystic Origin of Mount Kongtong, who elucidated the mysterious texts of the Dragon Han era and expounded the wondrous subtleties of the Red Brightness. He taught the talismans of the Ten Caves and the Three Vehicles, transforming the myriad mechanisms into a single principle. He composed a commentary on *The Scripture of Prolonging Life through the Northern Dipper*, which, in its highest aspect, enables the spirit to ascend to the Golden Gates; in its middle aspect, protects the state and secures the household; and in its lower aspect, prolongs life and extends longevity. It universally delivers all sentient beings, guiding them together through the barrierless gate. Therefore, I respectfully compose this text to preface the scripture.\n\n*Respectfully composed by Li Bai.*\n\n---\n\n**Commentary and Verses on the Supreme Mysterious Numinous Original Destiny Life-Prolonging Perfected Scripture, Fascicle One**\n*By the Perfected One of Mystic Origin of Mount Kongtong*\n\n\"Supreme\" (*Tai*) signifies the ultimate; \"High\" (*Shang*) signifies loftiness. \"Mysterious\" (*Xuan*) signifies profound remoteness; \"Numinous\" (*Ling*) signifies divine efficacy. The \"Northern Dipper\" (*Beidou*) is the pivotal mechanism of celestial movement. \"Original Destiny\" (*Benming*) is the inherent nature from the origin. \"Prolonging Life\" (*Yansheng*) is enduring existence without decay. \"Perfected Scripture\" (*Zhenjing*) is the path leading to the attainment of true subtlety.\n\n○ The great assembly of sagely and perfected heavenly beings imparts teachings to guide and transform the world. Whether one’s fate is prosperous or adverse, the ultimate goal is non-action. Internally, one harmonizes the central equilibrium; externally, one aligns with the pivotal mechanism. Through transformation, one ascends in flight to wander and feast in the Jade Capital. Yet how is it that worldly people remain deluded by the true Dao, indulging in greed, wrath, and ignorance, giving rise to the three karmic actions and stirring the six sensory faculties?\n\nThe \"three karmic actions\" are greed, wrath, and ignorance. The \"six sensory faculties\" are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. Once the three karmic actions arise, the six faculties generate obstructions. With obstructions, afflictions arise. With afflictions, myriad entanglements ensue, turning one away from the true purpose. The mind-horse runs wild, the heart-ape dashes in frenzy, scattering and losing the numinous source, corrupting and destroying the true *qi*. Sins accumulate like mountains, while good deeds are as fleeting as dust or dew. The Southern Asterism shortens one’s allotted lifespan, the Northern Dipper erases one’s years. Upon death, one enters Fengdu, enduring every torment: sword trees, blade mountains, cauldrons of boiling water, furnaces of burning coals, unceasing torture, endless wailing. Kin and relatives weep in vain, while one alone suffers in desolation. Even if one were a high-ranking noble or a wealthy lord, what benefit is there in the end? How can one discern the turbid from the clear, embrace the true, and return to the One?\n\n**Verse:**\nThe Supreme Perfected Teachings deliver the deluded world,\nBreaking from evil, returning to rectitude, and abstaining from greed, wrath, and ignorance.\n\nFleeting worldly ties bring no true joy,\nYet the primal homeland’s scenes are most wondrous.\nA few wisps of dawn mist drift across distant ridges,\nA sliver of slanting moon illumines the cold pond.\n\nTo know the principle of extending life in one’s original destiny,\nAwaken to the mystery of the primal creative mechanism.\n\nAt that time, the Most High Lord Lao, in the first year of *Yongshou*, on the seventh day of the first month, was in the Supreme Ultimate Palace within the Great Clarity Realm.\nThat time—this very moment.\nThe Most High Lord Lao—ancestor of Heaven and Earth, origin of the myriad dharmas, whose sacred virtue towers beyond measure.\nThe first year of *Yongshou*, the seventh day of the first month—within the boundless void, where kalpas endure without end, cycles defy numbering, yet we force them into calendric names.\nIn the Great Clarity Realm, within the Supreme Ultimate Palace—realm of carefree wandering, land of spontaneous freedom, where jade halls rise in majesty, towers of jasper soar in splendor, gold and jade gleam resplendent, and radiant clouds stream with light.\n\nThus did the Most High Lord Lao dwell in his abode, attended by the myriad spirits. Yet worldly beings know only that the Most High Lord Lao resides above the azure vault, unaware that he abides within the human body itself. Hence it is said: the Three Clarities are within oneself—why seek them without?\n\n**Verse:**\nThe Great Dao’s subtlety defies all probing,\nYet within it lies the profound mystery of wondrous workings.\nWhy search beyond the clouds for true awakening?\nSeek but the ancestral wind within your own body.\nRecognize the path from which you came of old,\nAnd let flowers and trees grow as they will.\nTo cultivate without grasping this principle\nIs like scooping water to summon the toad—utterly in vain.\n\nBeholding sentient beings adrift for kalpas unending,\nTrapped in the cycles of birth and death:\nAll beings are originally of one work with Heaven and Earth,\nOf one substance with sages and worthies.\nAwakened, they become sages;\nDeluded, they are but ordinary mortals.\n\n**O assembly!** Those who awaken awaken to the wondrous function of the true and constant,\nSeizing the transformations of Heaven and Earth.\nThey preserve their true nature and nurture their essence,\nRefine their souls and clarify their spirits,\nEmpty their minds that intent may be at peace,\nCut off their desires that their spirits may be clear.\nUnattached to the myriad things in their single mind,\nTheir flawless practice reaches completion, their work is done.\nThey abide in effortless spontaneity,\nCarefree beyond the realm of things.\n\nThe deluded are deluded in their true awakened nature.\nRelying on the harmonious *qi* of their parents’ union,\nEntrusted to the generative essence of yin and yang,\nThey enter the womb as a borrowed form.\nWhen their *qi* is full and their form complete,\nAfter ten months, they are born as human beings.\nThen, receiving the four elements and five aggregates,\nTheir illusory, impermanent bodies take shape.\nScarcely do they discern east from west,\nGradually distinguishing south from north,\nWhen their eyes already behold perverse sights,\nTheir ears hear perverse sounds,\nTheir tongues savor perverse flavors,\nTheir noses smell perverse fragrances.\nTheir minds crave and cling to desires,\nTheir hearts arise in love and aversion.\nIn action, they spawn right and wrong;\nIn movement, they generate crookedness and obscurity.\nPlanting the roots of all evils,\nThey receive retribution in the three evil destinies,\nAdrift for kalpas unending,\nTrapped in the wheel of birth and death.\n\nThus did the Most High Lord Lao manifest his great divine power,\nHis eyes radiating the light of great spiritual penetration.\nBeholding sentient beings drifting in the cycle of birth and death without end,\nHe was moved by compassion and broadly bestowed the true teachings,\nMaking them the boat and oar to ferry the world,\nThat beings might awaken to the formless form,\nRecognize the formless form,\nAnd thereby attain long life and spontaneous freedom,\nForever ceasing their wanderings in the wheel of rebirth.\n\n**Verse:**\nOur original countenance—how could it be lost?\nOnly through greed and delusion do we enter dreams again and again.\nFortunate that the celestial realm contains chaos,\nYet how can we bear to let the mind-ground sprout dust and defilement?\nWithin being and non-being, seek the illusory and false;\nAmidst emptiness and form, find the true and real.\nReturn to the homeland where the scenery is fine—\nWildflowers, singing birds, and willows in spring.\n\nSome dwell in the human realm,\nSome in the Middle Kingdom,\nSome among the barbarian tribes,\nSome within savage lands.\nSome are rich, some noble,\nSome lowly, some poor.\nFor a time, by karmic conditions,\nThey fall into hell.\n\nFor sentient beings, according to their karmic deeds,\nReceive rebirth in accord with their fruits:\nSome are born in the Middle Kingdom,\nSome among barbarians,\nSome in the households of the wealthy and noble,\nSome in the homes of the poor and lowly.\nHaving briefly attained human form,\nMany follow their desires,\nUnaware and unknowing,\nIndulging their passions and committing transgressions,\nRecklessly acting wrongly.\nThe Three Corpses fully orchestrate their downfall,\nThe Six Bandits freely incite their cunning.\n**O assembly!** Greedy for wealth and lustful for beauty,\nTheir words belie their hearts.\nJealous of the capable, they ruin the worthy;\nThey deceive Heaven and Earth.\nDisloyal and unfilial,\nDishonest and untrustworthy,\nThey harm the good and virtuous,\nOppress the kind and gentle.\nViolating Heaven and Earth’s prohibitions,\nDefying the statutes of true sages,\nThey plunder nests and break eggs,\nSlaying and harming sentient beings.\nCommitting all manner of sins and transgressions,\nThey never reflect upon themselves.\nThe thirty-six thousand spirits within their bodies\nTransform into eighty-four thousand dust-like afflictions and karmic deeds.\nThe fire of calamity burns their bodies, leaving no escape.\nThe four elements and five aggregates scatter with earth, water, fire, and wind,\nLeaving only their lonely, wandering souls—\nFor in their days of fleeting karmic conditions,\nClinging and deluded, they failed to awaken,\nFalling into the Avīci Hell.\nHow could they not know sorrow?\n\nYet humans possess a dignified six-foot frame,\nWashing and adorning it,\nDressing in fine silks and splendid attire,\nCherishing their bodies.\nWho among them is willing to preserve their true nature, nurture their lives,\nRefine their essence, and store their spirits?\nThus does the Heavenly Worthy bestow his scriptures and dharmas,\nGuiding sentient beings,\nSwiftly enabling them to suddenly comprehend,\nAnd awaken to the wondrous mystery of non-action.\n\n**Verse:**\nIn the celestial realm, spring days are longest,\nRain-cleared skies, warm mist, and radiant winds.\n\nAlas, the swallows return to splendid halls,\nYet mock the wandering bees that chase faint fragrance.\nGraceful blossoms brighten the small garden,\nTender willows sway, brushing the winding pond.\n\nHow lamentable—countless scenes of fleeting spring,\nButterflies dance, bees roam, their wings wild with play.\nYet for want of constancy, karmic bonds entangle,\nSouls bound to the nether courts, suffering until their debt is paid.\nWhen human destiny is forsaken,\nThey are reborn among beasts or fowl and insects,\nTurning from the human Way, their human form lost.\nThus sunk in delusion, they know not their plight,\nFor past lives’ delusion of truth brings this cycle of rebirth.\n\nNow, heaven and hell lie in human conduct alone.\nThus it is said: good and evil have no gate—\nOnly humans summon them.\nIf one accumulates goodness in life,\nHeaven and earth shelter them, sun and moon shine upon them,\nGhosts and spirits revere them, true sages guard their door.\nWith such divine protection,\nFortune and blessings gather near, calamity and misfortune flee far,\nAnd they become the wise, their names inscribed in Jade Clarity.\n\nO assembly! Among all things, humans are most noble—\nWhy are humans most noble?\nThey seize the mechanism of heaven and earth,\nFathom the principles of yin and yang,\nPlumb the obscure, probe the profound,\nGuide and realize the true principle.\nOnly humans may attain the Dao and ascend as immortals.\n\nYet humans, unaware of the sage within,\nIndulge in reckless folly,\nLetting the six desires and seven emotions run wild,\nCommitting the ten evils and five rebellions,\nDisrespecting the Three Luminaries,\nDishonoring the nine ancestors.\nDay by day, month by month, sins pile like mountains,\nSouls bound to the nether courts, enduring every torment,\nUnceasing through day and night,\nDying a thousand deaths, reborn a myriad times,\nWith no escape,\nUntil their suffering is complete,\nOnly then briefly released—\nYet they fall into the realm of hungry ghosts,\nOr among beasts: camels, mules, elephants, horses, birds, and insects.\nThus sunk in delusion, they forever lose their human form.\n\nAlas!\nFor delusion brings no benefit, madness serves no purpose,\nThus they cast aside true suchness and cling to mere husks.\n\n**Verse:**\nOnly for aimless folly, wisdom too dull,\nTheir souls are bound to Fengdu’s halls.\nThe nether officials interrogate, leaving them choked with grief,\nJailers torment, forcing sighs and groans.\nThough briefly freed from the underworld,\nThey stray from the old path, taking on new forms.\nPity them, trapped among beasts—\nTo regain a human body would take ten thousand kalpas.\n\nWith a heart of compassion, the Heavenly Worthy divides his form to teach and transform,\nHis emanation descending to the capital of Shu.\nEarth spirits surge forth, raising a jade platform to serve as his lofty seat.\nFor the Heavenly Worthy, sighing over sentient beings adrift in the six destinies,\nReceiving retribution in the three paths,\nDivides his form to teach and transform,\nHis emanation descending to the capital of Shu.\nAt that time, sun and moon ceased their turning,\nStars halted their wheels,\nHeaven and earth grew solemn and still,\nRivers and seas calmed.\nThus did earth spirits surge forth, raising a jade platform to serve as his lofty seat.\n\nO assembly! What is the meaning of this?\nFor there are no faultless sages, nor faultless ordinary beings.\nBy manifesting great divine power,\nHe prevents sentient beings from planting karmic roots,\nAwakening them to the great Dao.\nYet the great Dao is formless and nameless,\nBeyond all comparison, difficult to describe—\nThus he establishes this expedient teaching.\n\nThe Perfected of the Great Ultimate once said in verse:\nThough the great Dao has no heart,\nIt may be sought through compassion.\nThus, with a heart of compassion, he divides his form to teach and transform—\nFor if sentient beings can arouse a heart of compassion, this is it.\n\nO assembly! How can it be said that the Heavenly Worthy is none other than sentient beings?\nThough a nation has laws, transgression brings punishment to the body;\nYet if one is without fault, how could punishment cling to them?\nIf one reflects on wrongs and reforms,\nCeasing to create transgressions,\nThen no calamity will approach—\nIs this not so?\n\nThus the *Scripture of Salvation* says:\nIf you do not delight in the immortal Dao,\nHow can you escape the three realms?\nIf you wish to turn through the five destinies,\nWhat can I do for you?\n\nAs for Shu Capital—if we speak in worldly terms, it was once the dwelling place of emperors, the ancestral root of mountains and rivers, the guiding principle of the cosmos, revolving through the world, transforming like fish and dragons; such was it when it served as the imperial seat.\n\nIf we speak in Daoist terms, Shu Capital is none other than the body and heart. Thus the *Nine Elders’ Treatise on Gathering the Real* says:\n*\"The wind and moon of Great Peace grace the imperial capital,\nAll nations come to pay homage to the Sage’s grace.\"*\n\nThe heart is likened to the emperor, the body to Shu Capital. When the heart is upright, the hundred bones rejoice, the myriad spirits harmonize and flourish. When the heart is perverse, the Three Corpses seize life, the Six Thieves deceive the public, calamity befalls the body, and one drifts endlessly through the wheel of rebirth.\n\nThe earth spirits surging forth represent the arising of intention from the mind-ground. The single jade platform is the precious throne of the celestial perfected. If one can arouse the heart and establish intention, refrain from perverse views, and avoid planting the seeds of transgression, then by seeking the gate of the great Dao and suddenly awakening to the nature of non-action, one will not be deluded by the faults of the six desires, attain the rank of the Ten Flowers, wander freely beyond the mundane, and merge with the Real.\n\nA verse says:\nDo not block the azure heavens’ path, nor deem it impassable;\nThis illusory body—know it turns to emptiness in an instant.\nCease idle talk of grasping profound principles,\nFor without true sincerity, all efforts are in vain.\nStrike boldly open the gate of life and death,\nLet the hero leap free from the dragon of bondage.\nWandering beyond the mundane as a guest of non-action,\nSun and moon are seized and held within your grasp.\n\nThereupon, the Lord Lao ascended the Jade Platform to sit, bestowing upon the Heavenly Master the *Northern Dipper Life-Span Scripture and Oral Instructions*, broadly proclaiming essential methods to universally deliver sentient beings.\n\nAt that time, the Most High Lord Lao ascended the Jade Platform and expounded the teachings of the Three Vehicles, revealing the wondrous principles of the Northern Dipper’s life-prolonging essence. He bestowed these upon the Heavenly Master to transform and enlighten all beings, that all might awaken to the Dao.\n\nO assembly! Sentient beings indulge their seven emotions, incurring transgressions and thus hells; they covet the five desires, lacking wondrous fruits and thus no heavens. Unaware, they wallow in the Three Poisons and Ten Evils, drowning in the river of love, drifting through the cycle of birth and death.\n\nTherefore, the Most High expounded this true scripture to guide the world, that people might not generate perverse views. In the intervals between dawn and dusk, regardless of others’ faults, one should constantly examine one’s own errors, temper sharp words with restraint, and repent accordingly. Using the Dharma-water to wash away worldly toil, polishing the precious mirror to illuminate this self, one purifies body and heart, embodying the function of the Dao. The primordial spirit dwells in the cinnabar palace, the light of wisdom shines upon the Jade Mountain. The Four Great Elements are at peace, the hundred bones naturally ordered. Within and without, emptiness and clarity; above and below, stillness and illumination. Yin and yang unite in intercourse, their movement endless. Merging into a single qi, refining the great elixir, one transforms, ascends in flight—profound beyond all reckoning.\n\nWhen the ordinary form thus embodies the function of the Dao,\nEven sacred works need not be feared as unattainable.\n\nA verse says:\n\nWhen the elixir-body is refined, it becomes naturally so,\nBeyond the round and penetrating, one glimpses the paradise within the pot.\nFame and profit are but affairs of others’ households,\nVirtue and power are all for my own karmic conditions.\n\nWhen the wind stills and rain clears, waves ripple emerald,\nWhen mist disperses and clouds scatter, the moon’s radiance is fair.\nIn stillness, one beholds the adorned realm,\nEach thing, each head—profound, ever more profound.\n\nAt this time, the Elder Lord addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: “The human body is hard to obtain, birth in the Middle Land is hard to attain. Even if one attains birth, the true Dharma is hard to encounter. Reflecting upon the cycles of birth and death, within the wombs of womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born, and transformation-born beings—whether in deep mountains or desolate wilds, whether dwelling among grasses and trees or in rivers and streams—pigs, dogs, oxen, horses, donkeys, mules, and other beasts of burden; venomous insects and fierce beasts, tigers, leopards, jackals, and wolves; shrimp, crabs, fish, turtles, and all aquatic creatures; birds, beasts, and flying fowl; the myriad forms of the six livestock and all feathered kinds; every sort of secondary-born being—boundless and immeasurable, how can their numbers be known? Compared to such creatures, humans are as one in ten thousand.\n\nAlas! The multitude squanders and ruins what is not theirs. Even if one attains a human body, to be born among the barbarians beyond civilization is still a transgression. Dwelling in such lands, have you ever heard of the country called Boye beyond the Northern Sea? In that land, people dwell in mountains in summer and hide in caves in winter. Desolate grasses stretch endlessly, yellow winds sweep the earth, and they clothe themselves in leaves and fur. Hunger is sated with birds and insects, neither benevolence nor righteousness is known, nor is there any understanding of virtue and power. They indulge their desires, commit wrongs, and transgress, making it difficult to ascend the immortal’s ranks and easy to sink into the ghostly realms.\n\nNow that you dwell in a land where the Three Teachings flow and the Five Constants govern, born as humans in the Middle Land—is this not the result of accumulated virtue? Yet even among those born in the Middle Land, many cling to perverse views, fail to encounter the true Dharma, boast of their own cleverness, vaunt their superiority, falsely claim mastery of the mysterious gate, and misinterpret the scriptures and laws. Thus deluded, they cannot perceive the Dao.\n\nFailing to recognize the true principles of the Three Teachings,\nOne comes to this dusty world in vain.\n\nA verse says:\nThe cycles of the Six Paths—alas, how lamentable!\nYet within the square inch of the heart, apply your effort.\nWhen the playful monkey is let loose, a thousand things arise,\nBut when the inferior horse is tamed, not half remains.\nThe mundane scene blends like the autumn night’s moon,\nRoot and dust are entrusted to the jade-green pot.\nThe homeland is but a footstep away, the scenery fair—\nWith a sweep of the sleeve, laugh and stride the level path.\n\nMany are deluded by the true Dao, many enter perverse sects,\nMany plant the roots of sin, many practice cunning deceit,\nMany indulge in lust and killing, many favor worldly attachments,\nMany give rein to greed and wrath, many sink into hell,\nMany lose the human form.\n\nSuch are the conditions of sentient beings who do not awaken, who know not the true Dao, and whose delusions are many. For their good roots are shallow, their wisdom dim and turbid. They refuse loyalty to their lord, filial piety to their parents; the poor do not keep to their station, the rich do not bestow their grace. They seek no good, aid not the distressed, scorn the Three Luminaries, and waste the Five Grains. They plunge into the bitter sea of craving for wealth and lust, toiling endlessly in the cage of strife for fame and gain. They disbelieve in karma, hoard with stinginess, seethe with envy, slaughter creatures, feast on dogs and swine, sever lives to clog their own flesh with pus. Relying on power and might, they bully the lowly, devour flesh and blood, spew filthy words, gossip and slander, stir dualistic views. When they encounter fasts and offerings, they harbor destructive thoughts; when they see true cultivators, they foster disbelief. Countless are their delusions, their wisdom obscured. Many sink into hell, many lose the human form, failing to see the true Dao and entering only perverse sects.\n\nAlas, how may the multitude perceive the true Dao?\nDo not cling to sound, scent, taste, touch, or dharmas;\nDo not give rise to stinginess, greed, killing, theft, or lust.\nAwaken great wisdom, purify body and heart,\nInwardly observe the six roots, the Four Great Elements, the five viscera, and the hundred spirits.\nBy what do these forms move? By what do they speak?\nWhen a single breath does not come, the Four Great Elements suddenly cease.\n\nA verse says:\nWithin the body, the subtle and mysterious lie clearly revealed—\nDo not give rise to stinginess or greed, nor be deluded by phenomena.\nWhen the great Dao is awakened, true joy arises,\nBut when worldly affairs are discerned, only sorrow remains.\nDo not indulge in turbidity and wallow in evils,\nBut purify the heart and transform the Five Decays.\nWhen spirit and nature are free of dust and defilement,\nHeaven and earth expand to reveal the numinous foundation.\n\nNow, moved by pity for these sentient beings,\nI set forth the teachings and expound the good conditions,\nThat they may know the Dao, know the nature and life of the body,\nAll of which depend on the Dao for their arising.\n\nMoreover, the sages established the teachings in myriad ways,\nAdapting their methods to the capacities of beings,\nSetting forth laws to deliver them,\nThat all sentient beings might awaken to the great Dao\nAnd know that heaven, earth, and the myriad things all depend on the Dao for their arising.\n\nFor the great Dao arises from non-being into being,\nAnd from non-nothingness into nothingness—\nTruly, it is hard to speak of!\n\nWhen heaven and earth were formless,\nAt the time when the clear and turbid had not yet separated,\nVast and obscure, dim and silent,\nIt could not be heard, nor could it be seen.\nIn the midst of the indistinct and vague,\nThe Five Ultimates arose.\nWhen the kalpas of the Five Ultimates ended,\nA single qi congealed, transforming into chaos.\nAfter ninety thousand kalpas,\nGradually, the mysterious and the yellow emerged.\nThen, the Primordial Sovereign nurtured essence and cultivated qi to perfection,\nBursting open the chaos.\nThe two qi subtly divided,\nThe Three Powers began to take form.\nThe clear qi congealed and floated upward to become heaven,\nThe turbid qi settled and sank downward to become earth.\nThe sun, moon, stars, and constellations were arrayed,\nMountains, rivers, seas, and peaks were established.\nCold and heat shifted, yin and yang ascended and descended,\nAnd the myriad things were born—\nNone apart from the great Dao.\n\nThus the *Scripture of Purity* says:\n“The great Dao has no name, yet it gives birth to heaven and earth;\nThe great Dao has no form, yet it nurtures the myriad things.”\n\nYet heaven and earth are but the offspring of the Dao,\nThe sun and moon its grandchildren.\nHeaven and earth cannot form without essence and qi,\nThe sun and moon cannot shine without essence and qi.\nGrasses and trees wither when deprived of essence and qi,\nThe human form perishes when essence and qi are exhausted.\n\nThus, humanity is never far from the Dao,\nAnd the Dao never departs from humanity—\nFor the human body embraces the Dao,\nAnd shares the same substance as heaven and earth.\nThose who seek to cultivate the true must wield heaven’s function,\nAnd thereby align with the Dao to achieve perfection.\n\nAs the *Scripture of Yin Conformity* states:\n“Observe heaven’s Dao, grasp heaven’s workings—\nThis is all there is to it.”\n\nFor those who study the Dao,\nSimply observing heaven’s function and grasping its workings is sufficient.\nRefine the yin soul to transform it into yang spirit,\nExchange the mortal frame for an immortal body.\n\nA verse says:\nComprehending the origins of the myriad dharmas,\nOne radiates silent illumination, stirring the profound mystery.\nThe Five Agents emerge blended within the crucible’s scene,\nThe Seven Returns refine a realm beyond all form.\nThe golden crow soars in silence to the crimson palace,\nThe jade hare endlessly plays in the moon’s luminous glow.\nWho knows this true message?\nWithout encountering an extraordinary person, it cannot be transmitted.\n\nAwakening to this cause,\nOne attains long life within the human realm,\nThe seed is never severed,\nAnd generation after generation, one remains human—\nNever born in a land devoid of the Dao,\nNever cut off from the root of humanity.\n\nIf one can arouse the mind of supreme goodness,\nUproot all evil tendencies,\nEradicate the divisions of self and other,\nFill the pit of desire and love,\nInstantly break free from the bonds of confinement,\nDispel the mind of leakage and defilement,\nAnd awaken to the nature of non-action—\nHow joyful indeed!\n\nWhen the assembly awakens to the great Dao,\nWhat wondrous fruits will they attain?\nWithout enduring suffering or entering hell,\nA hundred blessings will silently gather,\nA thousand calamities will vanish.\nAll aspirations will be fulfilled,\nClothing and sustenance will come naturally,\nLongevity will be extended,\nAnd one will dwell in peace within a joyful land.\n\nThus the *Scripture of Purity* says:\n“The superior person, awakening to it, ascends to the celestial offices;\nThe middling person, awakening to it, ranks among the immortals of the Southern Palace;\nThe lesser person, cultivating it, enjoys long life in the world.”\n\nYet if sentient beings plant the seeds of evil,\nThey will not reap blessings;\nIf they cultivate goodness,\nThey will not incur misfortune.\nFor instance, if one attains great insight,\nSuddenly awakens to understanding,\nContemplates the true and invokes the sacred,\nPurifies the defiled and clarifies the mind—\nThe supreme benefit will be obtained,\nAnd none can usurp what you alone enjoy.\nHave you planted the seeds of good deeds?\nFor the accumulation of goodness yields good fruits,\nWhile the practice of evil brings evil retribution.\n\nAs the *Scripture of the Chapter on Generating the Spirit* states:\n“Good and evil deeds, even by a hair’s breadth, are never lost.”\n\nAcross past, present, and future lives—\nThe three times—\nAnd among the four births (womb, egg, moisture, transformation) and six destinies,\nThe realms of wealth and poverty,\nWisdom and foolishness, high and low status,\nHungry ghosts, animals, camels, mules, elephants, horses,\nHell and heaven—\nAll arise from the deeds one has accumulated.\n\nThus the Confucian texts say:\n“The family that accumulates goodness will have abundant blessings,\nWhile the family that accumulates evil will surely face lingering misfortune.”\n\nReflect well: cleanse the heart and turn toward goodness,\nContemplate the causes of sin and fortune,\nThe retribution of good and evil—\nLike a shadow following form,\nLike an echo responding to sound.\n\nAlas! Do not harbor crooked thoughts or perverse views,\nDo not harm others for personal gain,\nDo not slander or envy the worthy and good,\nDo not entangle yourself in grievances and burdens.\nInstead, blend with the world, harmonize with its dust,\nAct in accordance with righteousness and measure your strength,\nBuild merit as opportunities arise,\nPractice the Dao with constant expedience,\nRelieve others and bestow kindness.\nThen, naturally,\nHeaven will cover you,\nEarth will bear you,\nThe sun and moon will illuminate you,\nAnd ghosts and spirits will revere you.\nYou will never be born in a land devoid of the Dao,\nNor will you ever sever the root of humanity.\n\nHah!\nWield wisdom’s hand to seize the dragon,\nShatter the primordial chaos of the heart!\n\nA verse says:\n\nWho can suddenly awaken to the subtle mysteries of the profound,\nYearning for the abstruse to grasp the wondrous mechanism?\nOnly then will you trust that chrysanthemums bloom as wild geese scatter in disarray,\nAnd know that willows darken as dancing bees grow sparse.\nFalling flowers and flowing waters—vanity’s fleeting dream,\nWild birds and solitary clouds—truly dependable.\nThis secluded dwelling urges early enlightenment;\nBeyond the green mountain gate, auspicious clouds take flight.\n\nFurther refine the heart in the upright Dao,\nGradually enter the immortal lineage,\nForever escape the wheel of rebirth,\nAnd ascend to transcendence.\n\nYet all beings must constantly restrain the self,\nAct with impartiality,\nFilial piety toward parents,\nLoyalty to the sovereign,\nReverence for Heaven, Earth, and the Three Luminaries,\nDeference to the sages of past and present,\nTemperance, prudence, humility, and modesty.\nMoreover, purify the heart,\nRefine nature amid the six desires,\nTranscend the five turbidities,\nQuell the mind to nurture wisdom,\nConceal traces and veil radiance,\nExternally cleanse the dust,\nInternally preserve the spirit,\nSeize the golden elixir from the jade spring,\nBattle the dragon and tiger in the alchemical crucible.\nDivine water irrigates the yellow sprout—all passages open,\nThe goat-drawn carriage bears the numinous essence—all spirits rejoice.\nPurify the form,\nCherish the spirit.\n\nThose who can do this\nWill naturally be free of distinctions,\nFree of love and aversion,\nFree of fetters,\nFree of grasping and rejecting,\nFree of coming and going,\nFree of defilement,\nFree of afflictions.\nThe six desires will not arise,\nThe three poisons will vanish,\nForever escaping the wheel of rebirth,\nAscending to transcendence.\n\nO assembly! Reflect: the original state is non-action,\nSerene and empty.\nWhence arise the obstructions of affliction?\nAll stem from the six desires and seven emotions.\nAwakened, they become the ten virtuous deeds;\nDeluded, they transform into the ten evil karmas.\nAwareness brings wisdom, perfect and unobstructed,\nCarefree and unbound.\nDelusion brings affliction, inversion,\nFalse thoughts, and ignorance,\nDrowning in the river of craving,\nDrifting through birth and death.\nWithin the six paths, tossed by waves,\nIn the three realms, suffering alone.\n\nAlas!\nDiligently cultivate the upright Dao,\nGradually enter the immortal lineage,\nRefine nature and preserve spirit,\nEnhance wisdom and still the heart.\nEmpty and quiescent within and without,\nIlluminating the profound and luminous.\nWhen merit and practice are accomplished,\nThe Five Elders will welcome you.\nUndivided in spirit and form,\nMerge with the Dao and ascend.\nThus forever escape the wheel of rebirth,\nAscend to transcendence.\nThose who can do this—profound, indeed, is the mystery!\n\nA verse says:\nTurn the heart to dispel the self, escape the cage of dust,\nReturn to simplicity, awaken to the true lineage.\nMountains’ beauty arises from last night’s rain,\nFlowers fall to the morning’s wind.\nWhere divine light shines, the profound is boundless,\nWhen wisdom transforms, wondrous merit is achieved.\nThe Dharma-eye opens to the true realm—\nA full moon hangs in the sky.\n\nThus I reveal to you this wondrous Dharma,\nTo ferry the people of the world,\nTo return to truth and know destiny.\n\nMoreover, the Most High, pitying beings who commit myriad evil deeds,\nWhose sins bind them to Fengdu,\nWhose retributions cycle endlessly,\nWhose enmities repeat,\nWho wander lost in delusion,\nDrifting through birth and death,\nHas bestowed this wondrous Dharma,\nRevealing it to the people of the world,\nThat they may know nature and destiny,\nReturn to truth and awaken to the Dao.\n\nO assembly! What is *nature*?\nWhat is *destiny*?\nReceiving life from the Dao is called *destiny*,\nMastering the great Dao is called *nature*.\nThus human life is limited,\nBut the original nature is unborn.\nAs the Old Lord said:\n“Where there is birth, there must be death;\nWithout death, there is no birth.”\n\nConsider human life:\nThe great limit is thirty-six thousand days—\nHow many in the world reach seventy springs?\nAll arise from myriad evils,\nKnowledge obscured in the sea of suffering’s ford,\nHastening ceaselessly in the wheel of rebirth,\nStriving amid the four births and six paths,\nRushing into the depths of suffering.\nFor this reason,\nFaces change repeatedly,\nYet the nature of true suchness,\nFrom the beginningless past,\nHas never known birth or death.\nIt is only because beings are deluded,\nLosing their original truth,\nObscuring their original nature,\nThat they rise and fall with karmic force,\nLive and die according to conditions.\nThus, how can they escape birth and death,\nAwaken to true nature, and return to the Dao?\n\nBut look within at the heart,\nClose the gates without,\nTemper desire,\nPurify the body.\nCrookedness can be straightened,\nStillness can be practiced.\nLove resides in qi,\nPreserve it in spirit.\nUnbroken throughout the day,\nAs if absent, as if present.\nWith the Dao’s work unbroken,\nAscend to the Jade Clarity—\nIs this not fortune?\n\nRecall the Most High’s myriad methods and thousand techniques,\nAll expounded and transformed,\nEstablishing scriptures and teachings,\nLeaving behind precepts and rituals,\nAs the pearl that illumines darkness,\nThe key that unlocks Heaven’s gate,\nThe boat that ferries across the world,\nThe ladder that ascends to truth.\nPointing the way for all people,\nAll return to truth and see the Dao.\n\nConsider the sages’ earnest efforts to transform,\nDesiring to ferry all beings—\nHow can one bear to betray their virtue?\n\nAh!\nTurn the light inward to reflect on the realm of true emptiness,\nLaugh!\nGhosts wail and spirits cry without cease.\n\nA verse says:\nAlas for the rugged six paths—\nHow can they compare to turning the heart and awakening to the great void?\nShatter the illusion of “within” and “without,”\nThen know the body contains “without” within.\nThe limpid moon hangs over the river,\nThe profound pearl gleams in the jade vessel.\nIf you seek to transcend worldly affairs,\nYou must apply true effort.\n\nOn the day of your destiny,\nHold a fast and set up an altar,\nInvoke the Northern Dipper, the Three Officials, the Five Emperors,\nThe Nine Bureaus and Four Departments,\nTo offer blessings and dispel calamities,\nPresent memorials and supplicate with sincerity.\nIf, on the day of your destiny,\nYou solemnly purify the chamber,\nDisplay banners, light incense and lamps,\nArrange the ritual in full,\nDevote yourself to prayer,\nPresent memorials and petitions,\nInvoke the deities of your destiny in the Northern Dipper,\nPray for blessings and grace,\nTransform misfortune into fortune,\nTo aid the people of the world.\n\nThus the Most High, pitying beings adrift in the bitter sea,\nDrowning in the ford of delusion,\nBorn and reborn in the three evil paths,\nDying and dying again in the six realms,\nHas specially bestowed this scripture,\nTo guide them back to the right path.\nIf, on the day of your destiny—be it the first *jiazi* or other fast days—\nYou purify the heart and cleanse the self,\nSwear allegiance to the Nine Heavens,\nReflect on past wrongs,\nVow to avoid future transgressions,\nAnd invoke the original spirit of your destiny within,\nThen you may dispel transgressions, scatter misfortune,\nBanish adversity, and welcome good fortune.\n\nHow does one invoke the original spirit of one’s destiny?\nSimply turn inward to the original heart, observe the fast, reform faults, and cultivate goodness—this is the way.\nFasting and offering rites: fasting is to discipline the heart, while offering is to express sincerity. By purifying body and mind, one may repent of past wrongs and thereby attain blessings.\nThus the saying: *\"The sickness of the self must be cured by the self.\"*\n\nWhat is the original spirit within the body?\nJust as heaven has the Northern Dipper, so too does the human body; just as heaven has the Three Officials and Five Emperors, so too does the human form possess its counterparts—nine palaces and four bureaus, all mirrored within.\nThe Northern Dipper within the body is the heart. The Dipper governs the turning of the four seasons and the revolutions of the celestial bodies, just as the heart governs the transformations of the myriad things and commands the hundred spirits. Thus, the Northern Dipper is the heart.\nThe Three Officials are the three *hun*-souls; the Five Emperors are the spirits of the five viscera. The nine palaces are the nine orifices; the four bureaus are the four limbs.\nIf one can nurture the three *hun*, harmonize the five viscera, subdue the nine orifices, and protect the four limbs from worldly defilement, cutting off mundane attachments, awakening to the subtle and profound, attaining clarity and emptiness, and perceiving without obstruction—then one may soar beyond the material realm. At such a stage, to pray for blessings and grace is indeed wondrous.\nThus, the sages established these external practices to guide the inner illumination of non-action.\nAh! Do you grasp this subtle truth? Once revealed, the ten thousand phenomena of the azure heavens become still.\n\n*A verse says:*\nTurn the heart back, reflect, and sever worldly ties;\nAwakening, one sees the natural state as it is.\nThe three realms are but fleeting flowers in the world’s dream,\nWhile the cinnamon of the Nine Heavens veils the profound mystery.\nThe heart of Dao is like the moon upon the waves,\nThe nature of Dharma blooms like a lotus in fire.\nWhen kalpas end and all is seen as void,\nThe green mountains stand tall against the distant sky.\n\nWith utmost reverence, present offerings—various incense and flowers, seasonal fresh fruits—following the rituals of the age. Purify the altar space, modeling heaven and earth.\nWhether in a temple or at home, perform the rites according to your capacity. The merit accrued is profound and beyond full description.\nRecite the names of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords, and your transgressions will dissolve, misfortunes be washed away, blessings and longevity sustain your destiny, and virtuous fruits manifest in your being.\n\nIce and charcoal cannot share the same furnace, nor can the wise and foolish dwell together. Ice and charcoal remain apart because their natures differ; the wise and foolish do not coexist because their perceptions diverge. Ice does not know it freezes, nor charcoal that it burns. The wise need not speak to be clear in wisdom; the foolish need not speak to be clouded in ignorance. The wise ever uphold righteousness and propriety, ever fearful of harming others; the foolish persist in cruelty, ever resentful of self-inflicted harm. Alas for the foolish!\nThus the *Book of Documents* states: *\"The virtuous do good, ever finding the day too short; the wicked do evil, ever finding the day too short.\"*\n\nWorldly beings, deluded and ignorant, fail to recognize their myriad transgressions. Yet the celestial officials record every good and evil deed without the slightest error. Know this: fulfill three thousand virtuous acts, and you may ascend as an immortal; accumulate eight hundred transgressions, and your life will be cut short. Then, in Fengdu, you shall endure bitterness alone, and your descendants will surely face hardship.\nAlas! The Most High laments the emptiness of the Ten Continents and Three Isles, the ceaseless wandering of the six paths and four births. Thus, through this scripture, the law of cause and effect is expounded, and retribution is decreed—guiding the wise toward goodness and warning the foolish against evil.\nBy adapting teachings to the capacities of the deluded, the Most High established these precepts and prohibitions. For those with confused minds seeking repentance, let them purify the altar, solemnize the ritual space, arrange incense and flowers, present seasonal fruits, perform the rites, and contribute according to their means. The merit thus accrued is vast and beyond description.\n\nKnow that the Great Dao arises from emptiness, and the original nature exists within non-existence. Who can truly describe it?\nThus the *Scripture on Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao* states:\n*\"Vast and obscure, the pure and tranquil Dao,\nDim and silent, the trace of the Great Void.\nIts essence is serene, dwelling nowhere,\nForm and mind both stilled in the One True Source.\"*\n\nThus, without the false, the true cannot be revealed; without illusion, how can reality be discerned? This wondrous Dharma is expounded to enlighten beings, that they may understand the causes of good and evil. Do not indulge in wrongdoing; do not yield to unchecked desires. Only then may one gradually enter the wondrous gate, awaken to the function of the Dao, and perceive the subtle mysteries beyond the material world—all within the square inch of the heart.\n\nAh!\nHad you but recognized the original face,\nYou would have untied the knot of true emptiness long ago.\n\n**Verse:**\n\nSever desire to cultivate the true,\nResolve to cultivate—then rise beyond the dust.\nRenounce fame, profit, right and wrong, love and hate;\nLet pine winds and bright moon be your neighbors near.\n\nShatter the illusory shadows of the dream,\nPreserve the body beyond the body, ever pure.\nI ask those who seek the Dao in this world:\nWhy let forms divide you into near and far?\n\nIn times of urgent peril, burn incense and recite the scriptures,\nAnd peace shall come within the appointed time.\n\nThus speaks the *Efficacy of the Great Sage Northern Dipper in Resolving Calamities*:\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Three Disasters.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe six senses—taste, touch, sound, and scent—\nSpawn the Three Disasters, long-enduring woes.\nLaughing at mirages rising on the sea’s edge,\nYet lost in wild geese’s script across the distant sky.\nNot knowing things are false—what makes them so?\nYou must believe the fault lies in your own measure.\nLike a rustic gazing at clouds in the wild,\nLingering speechless as the slanting sun stands still.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Four Slaying Calamities.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe six dusts, uncast aside, breed harm;\nThe Four Slayings clash, stirring dread and woe.\nSince demonic forces have not yet descended,\nGhosts and specters naturally contend and deceive.\nFierce winds snap the chrysanthemums in the courtyard,\nSudden rains batter the reeds by the river’s side.\nVainly resenting such carefree affairs—\nAt the end of one kalpa, at the start of the next, they appear and vanish.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Five Phases’ Calamities.\n\n**Verse:**\nKnow the original lord of the primal beginning,\nWhose spirit and form transcend the Five Phases.\nHow could the dark pines be locked by white clouds?\nWhen have the marshes ever been barred by green waters?\nAll dharmas are but the ancient moon,\nA thousand words but the one ancestral wind.\nWith forms and deeds, distinctions multiply—\nOnly by not obscuring emptiness is emptiness seen.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Six Harms.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe Seven Primal Lords, sages of profound wisdom,\nHow dare the Six Harms raise their heads?\nWind sweeps the evening clouds—mountains stand unmoved;\nMoon sinks in cold waves—waters rush on.\nThrough empty appearances, true appearances are known;\nThrough dust’s greed and sorrow, illusory cares are felt.\nIf only you cultivate vigilance day by day,\nYour light shall naturally fill the Four Divine Continents.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Seven Injuries.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe jeweled terrace and jade palace hold the Dao’s truth,\nYet the Seven Thieves hasten to deplete its cause.\nWind-tossed trees startle sweet dreams,\nBut the River of Stars allows leisurely wandering.\nRefining the elixir needs no gold or jade;\nPreserve your nature—do not be deluded by turbid or clear.\nWhen all leaks in the heart are stilled,\nA blue lotus naturally blooms in the fire.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Eight Difficulties.\n\n**Verse:**\nStubborn natures chase the world’s clamor,\nIllusion births Eight Difficulties, enduring torment.\nNot knowing the body’s limits are set by fate,\nYou must believe the years flee, never to return.\nYielding to one thought, lost in love and desire,\nYou willingly embrace a hundred miseries in their bitter cage.\nWhen sins are formed, what use is repentance?\nPolish the precious mirror—no flaw remains.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Nine Stars’ Calamities.\n\n**Verse:**\nWhen fortune and misfortune intertwine, how can sorrow cease?\nThe Nine Stars refuse to lessen your transgressions.\nAll because a single spark of numinous light dims,\nPermitting hordes of demons to vie for dominance.\nForsaking the old garden, you feel no longing,\nYet lost in illusory pleasures, you crave suffering.\nIf you do not break free from the bonds that bind you,\nWhen will your divine nature know freedom?\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Husband and Wife.\n\n**Verse:**\nWho knows that union conceals the Great Brahma?\nWhen refining, you must restrain the demon hordes.\nYin and yang briefly return to the source’s path,\nThe divine nature must emerge from the river of love.\nAt night, the moon shines fair on emerald peaks;\nAt dawn, the sea winds harmonize by the azure stream.\nAlas for the deluded ones who have not awakened—\nSo many neglect true emptiness, lost in the chase.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Sons and Daughters.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe numinous light, originally undivided,\nTakes form according to causes—thus paths diverge.\nWaters flood, clouds chill—waves freeze of themselves;\nSun rises, mist warms—ice melts away.\nFortunate to abide in constant purity,\nYet wisdom’s nature must not invite peril.\nLosing the true and wondrous principle,\nYou waste your efforts in the cycle of Jambudvīpa.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Childbirth.\n\n**Verse:**\nKnowing the cause, yet lost again in dust,\nPassions open, leaks arise—the Dao does not harmonize.\nYouth departs, age returns—decaying illusions,\nExiting one layer, reentering another—false forms.\nThe wheel of rebirth wears away adorned realms,\nDefilement veils the jeweled mirror’s stand.\nNow I urge the true superior ones of this world:\nCultivate well the state of no going, no coming.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Repeated Afflictions.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe divine nature is non-action, unbound by fetters,\nHow can repeated afflictions be your burden?\nWorldly splendor does not know original sameness,\nTrue principle is buried, its fullness unachieved.\nThe Eight Sufferings contend, creating obstacles,\nThe Ten Bonds converge, stirring fear and sorrow.\nKnowing it is thus, how can you tarry?\nTurn back, renounce—all is resolved at once.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Epidemics.\n\n**Verse:**\nHeat and cold, wind and snow come and go,\nCutting short frail bodies, weaving calamities.\nNot knowing how to nurture and harmonize,\nGreed and delusion willingly harm the form.\nThe Six Thieves steal, depleting the radiant light,\nThe Five Ghosts hasten plagues and disasters.\nOnly by awakening to your true nature and invoking the Great Sage\nCan you be rescued from peril, delivered from the wheel.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Illness.\n\n**Verse:**\nIf common folk wish to rise beyond the dust,\nDo not let illness drive you to seek physicians.\nIf the mind’s ground cannot cast off clinging views,\nWhat use is reciting true teachings?\nBefore the mirror, no trace was ever there;\nBeneath the moon, clouds arise—yet its light remains.\nNeither clinging to the middle nor the extremes,\nLaughing, return to the cold stream by the cliffs.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Demonic Influences.\n\n**Verse:**\nA stubborn heart refuses to extinguish all ties,\nIn the dusty realm, demonic forces contend before you.\nTrue stillness and the Dao’s mystery grow daily fainter,\nWhile infatuation with worldly pleasures turns to pity.\nGradually, the body’s splendor fades like a withering hall,\nThe elixir’s waters are stolen, the Jade Field depleted.\n\nHow much better to awaken to the affairs of mist and moon,\nPreserving the true *qi* to strengthen one’s youthful years.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Tigers and Wolves.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe wondrous Dao of the Mysterious Origin is most subtle,\nYet when simplicity scatters into emptiness, who can know?\nThrough kalpas, it has never known birth or extinction,\nReturning to the Yellow—is this awakening or delusion?\nFortunate is the autumn sky’s moon without clouds,\nYet the winding shore’s tranquility fears the taint of mud.\nTo subdue tigers and seize dragons is the very point—\nYet this must truly rest in the man himself.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Insects and

Bandits and Disasters.\n\n**Verse:**\nWho can foresee and restrain peril and danger?\nOnly by unveiling the profound beyond the clouds is it attained.\nBefore earth and before heaven, the true principle is known,\nFrom the kalpa’s dawn to its dissolution, no fixed term is set.\nIlluminating inner and outer, the round and harmonious work,\nAwakening and illuminating the mechanisms of immortals and mortals.\nWith a single battle, demonic forces suddenly vanish,\nThe traces of plundering bandits fade into nothingness.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Cangues and Cudgels.\n\n**Verse:**\nBind the stubborn heart to prevent disorder,\nAnd the three thousand penal laws lose their power.\nSuddenly, the golden cangue of wondrous awakening falls away,\nThe great jade fetters of the mysterious wind are shattered.\nAt dawn’s shore, the cave’s brightness reveals hidden immortals,\nBy the cold pool, the moon’s radiance lingers in

Calamities of Curses and Oaths.\n\n**Verse:**\nEntangled in the floating life’s net, without refinement,\nSuffering delusion in illusory transformations, indulging in greed.\nThe carefree original form is imprisoned by dust,\nThe unobstructed true spirit is nearly entombed.\nWhen vexation drives one to vow and seek the Dao,\nOnce the affair fades, does the Dao-heart also cease?\nHurrying and bustling, turning the wheel of rebirth,\nAsk yourself: when will you reach the end?\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Heavenly Nets.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe true principle of non-action leaves no trace,\nYet all is the heart’s delusion—paths remain blocked.\nFrom ancient times, only due to craving worldly desires,\nTo this day, it entangles and obscures the mysterious void.\nThe oriole’s song—how can it understand the willow’s green?\nThe butterfly’s dance—how can it know the flower’s red?\nHeaven’s killing and heaven’s giving—matters of grace and harm—\nBetter to seek the profound and break through the darkness.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Earthly Nets.\n\n**Verse:**\nKnow that worldly desires bring many harms to the body,\nBetter to leap with lofty resolve beyond the nets.\nGreed and indulgence leave little level ground,\nWhile ignorance and stinginess, unrestrained, turn to demons.\nTo escape the deep pit requires strenuous effort,\nBefore the trench is dug, do not falter for a moment.\nClouds and water, mist and waves, stretch boundlessly—\nA small boat lightly drifts across the river of delusion.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Blades and Warfare.\n\n**Verse:**\nHow many kinds of blades and warfare exist in the world?\nAmid the thickets of right and wrong, they recklessly contend.\nSlanderous words are sharp as blades,\nYet a heart that embraces tolerance finds ease.\nWith a single thought, reform and pray to transcend the kalpa,\nCalmly, even lamplight seems cold.\nIn the heavens, the Jade Pivot’s Lord presides—\nTurning and sustaining, all is not difficult.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Water and Fire.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe sea of desire surges boundlessly, touching the sky,\nThe blazing fire of karma burns the plains.\nYet in emptiness, clarity, and stillness, waves are stilled,\nIn gentleness, forbearance, and serenity, smoke does not rise.\nForms and appearances both empty, the heart is naturally calm,\nUnstained by right and wrong, one follows conditions.\nWater ascends, fire descends—this is the true Dao,\nA high bridge spans the ford, ferrying the great river.\n\nThus, the Seven Primal Lords, the Great Sages, are profoundly efficacious.\nThey deliver from all calamities and hardships,\nLifting suffering beings beyond distress.\nIf one urgently invokes them, reciting for protection,\nAll may rely on the generation of a hundred blessings,\nHarmonizing with the Five Phases.\nThe three *hun* souls are secure and healthy,\nEvil spirits cannot linger.\nTrue *qi* descends from the five directions,\nMyriad blessings naturally gather.\nLongevity transcends the Eight Difficulties,\nAll through revering the Seven Stars.\nLife after life, the body is at ease,\nExistence after existence, the spirit remains pure.\nGoodness is like a shadow in light,\nResponse is like an echo in a valley.\nThe Three Primal Spirits together guard,\nThe myriad sages share the same clarity.\nWithout disaster or obstruction,\nEternally preserving the tranquility of the Dao-heart.\n\n**Verse:**\nSubduing demonic forces, the heart is naturally tranquil,\nThe Seven Primal Lords, the Great Sages, are profoundly efficacious.\nEver let the nature be like the moon without clouds,\nNever let the emotions be like duckweed on waves.\nExternally, wash the troubled breast to remove stains,\nInternally, polish the mysterious mirror to break through darkness.\nNaturally, the Eight Difficulties and Three Disasters vanish,\nAll through revering the Seven Stars.\n\n*Here ends the first scroll of the Commentary on the Wondrous True Scripture of the Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny for Extending Life.*\n\n**Commentary on the Wondrous True Scripture of the Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny for Extending Life, Scroll the Second**\n\n*Annotated and Versified by the Perfected One of Mystic Origin from Mount Kongtong*\n\nThe Lord Lao declares:\nThe Northern Apex suspends its image, and the host of stars pay homage—\nIt is the pivot of creation’s transformations, the sovereign of human spirits.\nBehold! The Northern Apex hangs resplendent in the azure vault,\nWhile the radiant stars circle the Celestial Throne in luminous array.\nThus, where the Dipper’s bowl turns, the ten thousand forms revolve in silent motion—\nWho can fathom its hidden workings?\n\nYet those who seek the Dao in the world\nOften exhaust themselves climbing mountains and fording streams in vain pursuit,\nWasting years without pause, seeking friends and masters—\nYet how can the primal spirit abide when they remain unaware?\nThey merely amass verses and recite poems,\nBut in the end, what do they truly gain?\nAll proves hollow in the end.\nIf one practices the Great Dao by grasping at fleeting clouds,\nOr seeks the subtle and formless by clutching at shadows,\nHow can attainment ever be achieved?\n\nHow, then, does one observe Heaven and Earth to manifest the Great Dao before one’s eyes,\nOr discern the stars to awaken to the Mystic Void beyond the world?\n\n**○** The assembly asks: *What is meant by observing Heaven and Earth, manifesting the Great Dao, discerning the stars, and awakening to the Mystic Void?*\n\nIt is this:\nHeaven and Earth each hold fast to purity and turbidity,\nThe sun and moon revolve in their courses,\nYin and yang ascend and descend,\nThe four seasons shift in transformation,\nGiving life and death to the myriad beings—\nThe Dao accords with spontaneity, thus:\n*This is observing Heaven and Earth to manifest the Great Dao.*\n\nThe Northern Dipper hangs high in the azure firmament,\nIts revolutions follow the seasons,\nIts cycles respond to all things,\nIt governs the host of stars,\nConceals and nurtures the ten thousand phenomena—\nSuch is the marvelous mystery of creation.\n*This is discerning the Dipper’s stars to awaken to the Mystic Void.*\n\nThus, the sagely virtue pervades Heaven above and Earth below,\nGiving rise to the myriad beings.\nWere the Dipper not to turn, none of the ten thousand kinds could come to be.\nDoes this not inspire profound reflection?\nIf all beings could practice this method,\nTheir Dao-work would be infallible,\nAnd the merit of their practice would surely be perfected.\n\nIt is told that the Mystic Martial Deity of the Northern Culmen, known as Perfected Warrior,\nOnce, in the Dragon-Han kalpa, pledged allegiance to the Northern Dipper as his teacher.\nLater, on Mount Wudang, his Dao-work was accomplished,\nAnd he ascended in broad daylight.\nYet since the age failed to awaken to this method,\nAfter the Perfected Lord’s attainment,\nNone have followed in his footsteps.\n\nAlas!\nThe true and profound principle lies elsewhere—\nNot to be sought in the depths of cloud-wreathed mountains.\n\nA hymn declares:\nThe wellspring of creation lies ever before your eyes,\nThe Dao hides not beyond the seas in recondite mystery.\nWhen awakened, each thing serves its use;\nWhen deluded, every turn becomes transgression.\nThough winds rage and waters run deep, waves must rise,\nThough rains cease and mountains stretch far, mists will linger.\nThe cassia moon hangs high in skies of azure clarity,\nEverywhere the perfect round reveals itself in nature’s course.\n\nProclaiming might across the Three Realms,\nGoverning the ten thousand spirits,\nJudging the appointed times of human good and evil,\nOverseeing the eyes of right and wrong in the nether courts.\n\nNow the Dao is the essence of one’s nature,\nAnd nature is the mechanism of the Dao.\nWhoever seeks to learn the Dao\nMust first perceive their nature.\nThus, stillness of nature is the Way of Heaven,\nWhile stirring of emotion is the response of things.\n\nYet the original nature of all beings,\nMoved by love of things, stirs into emotion,\nAnd through delusion and deviation loses its rectitude.\nNone can walk the Great Dao,\nNor guard against all evils,\nNor pass their days in tranquil detachment,\nNor follow circumstances with indifference,\nNor hold a will cold as dead ashes,\nNor maintain a nature still as rotten wood.\nInstead, they are ensnared by worldly concerns—\nSelf and others, profit and fame,\nRight and wrong, honor and disgrace—\nBy the six desires, the seven passions,\nGreed, wrath, ignorance, and anger.\nHeedless of the roots of sin,\nThey widely deploy their cunning,\nIndulging in harm to others as if it were skill,\nDeceiving their own hearts to seize what they deem gain.\nHow can they reflect that in the River of Love they sink into deep waves,\nOr that within the cycle of death and life they suffer the wheel of rebirth?\n\nO assembly! Strive to grasp the One without confusion in the heart,\nEmbrace the One without departing from the Dao.\nHow then may one guard the Dao?\nThe Great Dao appears formless to the eye,\nSoundless to the ear.\nIt cannot be deemed existent,\nYet the four seasons follow its course,\nAnd the myriad beings receive life from it—\nNor can it be deemed nonexistent.\n\nThus the *Sutra of Disaster Dispelling* states:\n“Nonbeing is not nonbeing; being is not being.”\nIn truth, it is neither being nor nonbeing,\nUtterly firm, utterly vast,\nFiner than the tiniest mote,\nVaster than heaven and earth.\nFrom yin and yang come cold and heat,\nFrom sun and moon comes their revolution,\nFrom the human comes spirit,\nFrom the body comes movement—\nThus all transformations of heaven and earth proceed from the Great Dao.\n\nBut how to take up this single point?\nSimply observe the essential mechanism of yin and yang,\nExamine the adaptability of creation’s changes,\nAnd naturally the body will accord with the principle of the Great Dao.\n\nConfucius also said:\n“Observe what they follow, examine what brings them peace.”\nThe meaning is the same.\n\nIf beings do not cling to deviant views,\nDo not commit transgressions or wrongs,\nBut purify their minds and single-mindedly take refuge in the Northern Dipper,\nThen none will fail to receive response.\n\nThe Northern Dipper governs the office of speech and tongue,\nDirecting the revolutions of the myriad transformations,\nAdministering the host of spirits.\nWithin the Dipper reside the deities who oversee judgment, peril, punishment, and transgression,\nCharged with meting out trials and penalties;\nAnd the deities who extend life, augment destiny, resolve calamities, and elevate rebirth,\nEntrusted with recording meritorious deeds.\nIf but a single thought turns toward cultivation,\nLife is prolonged and blessings inscribed,\nAnd the gods silently protect them.\nThus one attains effortless freedom,\nRoams carefree through the Three Realms,\nTransforms in the Jade Clarity,\nSoars through the Golden Gates,\nIn the great mystery of mysteries—\nIs this not joy?\n\nAh!\nBest to relinquish love and desire to awaken to the Dharma-gate,\nTo renounce greed and wrath and ascend the Great Dao.\n\nThe Hymn says:\nAmid the world’s thickets of profit and fame,\nThey forget their original ancestral clan.\nVainly pursuing connections, their proclamations spread far,\nYet the wondrous workings turn sluggish and dull.\nLimpid green waters obscure the lofty Han,\nVast white clouds veil distant peaks.\nIn the still of night, only the fisherman’s flute is heard,\nAmid the smartweed’s glow, his trace is lost.\n\nThe Five Phases share a common endowment,\nThe Seven Governors follow the same principle.\nThey possess the power to reverse death and inscribe life,\nThe force to dispel calamity and transcend tribulation.\nFrom emperors above to common folk below,\nThough ranks differ, destiny knows no distinction.\nThus the myriad transformations of Heaven and Earth are but one transformation,\nAnd the source of all things cannot arise save through the Dao.\n\nMoreover, the constellations of Heaven and Earth,\nThe sun and moon, wind and clouds,\nThunder and lightning, rain and dew,\nRivers and seas, deep springs,\nHills and mountains, grasses and fragrant flowers,\nCrops and harvests, the Five Phases and Seven Governors,\nThe shifts of yin and yang, the cycles of cold and heat,\nThe myriad forms of humankind,\nAll things and emotions—\nAll rely on the qi of emptiness and spontaneity, harmony and the Great One,\nAnd thus are brought to completion.\n\nO assembly!\nYet people of the world think not of inner truth,\nBut cling to external realms.\nThey forget the real and lose the Dao,\nIndulging in greed and desire.\nHow can they expect a hundred years of light\nWhen they waste their bodies in millennial decay?\nAlas, the deluded!\n\nThey sigh for worldly folk,\nWho adorn their chambers as dwellings for the body,\nUnknowing that the body is the chamber for the spirit.\nWhen the house collapses, the body has no shelter;\nWhen the body leaks, the spirit has no abode.\n\nIt is also said:\nCease your infatuation with illusory realms,\nLest you squander your original truth.\nBetter to curb desire and still thoughts,\nRefine your nature and clarify the mind.\nEver anxious that goodness falls short,\nEver fearful of faults that follow—\nContemplate the Dao, ponder the real,\nAnd no evils arise.\nGather harmonious qi in the cinnabar field,\nEstablish immortal ranks in the Purple Palace.\nThus you gain the power to reverse death and exchange life,\nThe force to dispel calamity and transcend tribulation.\nBreak free from the wheel of suffering,\nAnd roam carefree beyond the world.\n\nAh!\nWhen the moon’s light in the cold sky knows no high or low,\nAnd all obstructions are removed—\nEverywhere is bright.\n\nA Hymn says:\nThe Dao in essence is formless, beyond all words,\nCease seeking causes and conditions in the void.\nBeneath the willow’s shade, one indulges in the orioles’ chatter,\nBy the smartweed’s shore, who knows the egret’s hidden depths?\nHow many reeds and rushes bloom where flowers fall by the bank,\nWhile waves a thousand miles long dazzle the sky with their light.\nAt dusk, no fishing boats pass by,\nOnly the setting sun to face in old age.\n\nOrdinary folk in the world,\nMost are lost in delusion,\nUnknowing that the body belongs to the Northern Dipper,\nThat life is governed by the Celestial Treasury.\nWhen calamity and suffering strike,\nThey know not the gate of dissolution and release;\nWhen praying for blessings and life,\nThey are ignorant of the path of refuge.\n\nConsider how the Two Modes—Heaven and Earth—cover and bear all,\nSilently operating through the mystery’s mechanism,\nHow the Three Powers—Heaven, Earth, and Humanity—merge and transform,\nOpening wide the wondrous workings of the Dao.\nThus, when the Great Ultimate divided,\nIt transformed pure and turbid qi to form Heaven and Earth;\nWhen the Great Dao gave rise to change,\nIt accumulated the essence of yin and yang to create the sun and moon.\nThe myriad forms stand in ordered array,\nAll beings and things receive their mandate,\nNurtured by the breath yet not ruled, yet ruling,\nSustained by the bellows yet acting without acting—\nSuch is the Dao’s natural completeness.\n\nMoreover, in the human body, the four limbs and hundred bones\nMove only by the heart’s command.\nThus we know that Heaven and Earth, endowed with the Dao, take form,\nAnd so have life and death;\nThe human body, moved by the heart,\nAnd so has fortune and misfortune—\nAll lies in what the wise discern,\nFor good and evil summon their own consequences.\n\nThe heart is spirit,\nSpirit is nature.\nWhen nature is settled, spirit is at peace;\nWhen spirit is at peace, the heart moves.\nLet the heart move with harmonious qi,\nAnd the qi of the Orthodox Unity naturally aligns with the Dao—\nIs this not joy?\n\nO assembly!\nBefore the Great Dao formed the image of Heaven and Earth,\nAbove and below were empty and still,\nWithin and without vast and boundless.\nWho could see and grasp it?\nWho could speak of it?\nJust as before human nature entered the physical body,\nIt roamed beyond the world,\nFree and without constraint—\nWhat affairs could entangle it?\nWhat suffering could harm it?\n\nYet through kalpas upon kalpas,\nFrom delusion to delusion,\nIt twists and turns in the wheel of rebirth,\nDrifting through the cycles of life and death.\nIn death, it enters hell;\nIn life, it stumbles into the womb.\nAfter birth and escape from infancy,\nIt gradually awakens to worldly matters,\nEarly drawn to perversity and wrong,\nLosing its true principle.\nUnmindful of its confusion,\nIt imprisons its originally unobstructed nature within the flesh,\nWhere ten thousand kinds of misfortune and vexation assail it,\nYet still it does not awaken.\nTell me, what glory or joy is there in the dusty world?\n\nBut the common masses,\nUnknowing that their nature aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nThat their life shares the fate of the Dipper and stars,\nOften see good yet do not follow it,\nRush headlong into wrongdoing,\nMeet the cycles of waxing and waning,\nYet know not the way of nurturing life.\nThough there are arts to prolong life,\nHow would they know the path of refuge?\n\nAlas! Ah!\nFortunately, there is a path to ascend as an immortal,\nYet how can one avoid being swept away by the waves of greed and delusion?\n\nThe Ode says:\nRely on wisdom to rouse your heroic might,\nReverse the clear waves to surge from raging billows.\nEver let karmic roots give rise to good thoughts,\nLest the immortal’s path be overgrown with brambles and thorns.\nThe limpid lake’s clouds disperse—heaven’s edge lies far,\nThe verdant valley’s toad ascends—the sea’s corner soars high.\nAlone before the cold river’s boundless scenes,\nAll are embraced by the cloud-clinging patchwork robe.\n\nThus the soul and spirit are struck,\nMisfortunes coil and cling.\nSome suffer grave illness unhealed,\nOthers fall prey to demonic harm,\nYear upon year mired in distress,\nAge after age beset by misfortune,\nEntangled in lawsuits and summons,\nEven the departed are drawn into suffering.\n\nNow Heaven aids the good and punishes the unkind,\nThus it metes out retribution of fortune and calamity.\nPeople fear misfortune and welcome fortune,\nSo they should cultivate kindness and goodness as their cause.\nThus Heaven urges goodness with the promise of fortune,\nAnd people, desiring fortune, should guard against wrongdoing.\nYet the common masses, unaware of Heaven’s principle,\nMerely crave fortune without practicing goodness,\nVainly fear misfortune without shunning wrongdoing.\nFor such as these, to hope for peaceful dwelling and fortune\nIs something that has never been.\n\nThose who dwell in peace and enjoy fortune\nAre those who have once practiced kindness, established goodness,\nBeen cautious of transgressions, and guarded against wrongdoing.\nThus it is that fortune and misfortune arise from causes,\nGood and evil reap their due retribution.\nThose who deceive none and harm no other thrive long,\nOnly those who temper their nature and restrain themselves know lasting joy.\nThe clear record lies plain before your eyes,\nYet how can the obstinate heart not decide?\n\nFor example, in this world:\nDiligence brings wealth,\nFrugality brings abundance.\nWithout diligence and frugality,\nHow can one attain sufficiency?\nDesiring fortune, one should accumulate goodness,\nFearing misfortune, one should guard against wrongdoing.\nWithout accumulating goodness and guarding against wrongdoing,\nHow can one dwell in peace?\n\nYet the common masses of sentient beings\nDo not reflect on the retribution of good and evil,\nNor the clarity of rewards and judgments.\nInstead, they harbor jealousy, stinginess, and greed,\nLose their true nature and forsake the Way,\nFocusing only on the present,\nDeceiving their conscience for momentary gain,\nNever considering that myriad calamities will one day descend upon them.\nThus their souls are bound,\nMisfortunes coil and cling,\nIllness remains unhealed as malevolent qi invades,\nFortune does not flow as misfortunes arise,\nIn life, vexation;\nIn death, turmoil.\nHow much better to extinguish the karma of the mind and eliminate the karma of the body,\nTo awaken to the emptiness of form and perceive the emptiness of nature.\n\nThe Ode says:\nOriginally nothing bore a name,\nBut for greed and delusion, changes come unceasing.\nChasing pleasure, unaware it is the root of suffering,\nClinging to life, how can one believe it is the cause of transgression?\nFirst, you must unlock the lock upon your heart,\nWash away the dust upon your nature from times past.\nBest to tread with care upon the icy abyss—\nOnce lost, what day will you emerge from the depths?\n\nShould Heaven’s reproach descend,\nOr ghosts below lodge false accusations,\nWhen such peril and distress arise,\nHow can one seek deliverance?\nHasten to petition the Northern Dipper,\nOffer rites of thanks to the Perfected Lords,\nAnd recite the true scriptures,\nAcknowledge the Perfected Lord of your original destiny,\nOnly then will you attain peace and prosperity,\nAnd even deeper mysteries—\nYet these cannot be fully described.\n\nI humbly observe:\nThe Way of Heaven is impartial,\nIt befriends only the good.\nFortune and misfortune have their retribution,\nWhat they respond to lies in the heart.\nThus those who do good find fortune drawing near,\nThose who do evil find misfortune not far off.\nThe Nine Pure Great Canopy and the Three Wretched Hells\nBoth arise from the one heart, manifesting as two matters.\nThus know that the Way of Heaven does not fail sentient beings,\nRather, sentient beings violate the Way of Heaven.\nTherefore, fortune and misfortune follow like shadow and form,\nTrue retribution turns like a wheel in ceaseless revolution.\n\nO assembly, do you not see how clearly rewards and punishments are meted out?\nWhy then remain utterly deluded and unaware?\nOnly deceiving your conscience for fleeting gain,\nEver seeking your own glory,\nHarboring resentment and enmity,\nEver envying the joy of others.\nHow can you believe that to seek your own fortune,\nYou must first bring fortune to others?\nHarming others to benefit yourself\nOnly harms yourself in the dark.\nIf you doubt this, ask yourself but one question:\nCan deceit and luck outwit Heaven?\n\nWhen sins overflow and transgressions mount,\nProvoking Heaven’s wrath above\nAnd the deceit of ghosts below,\nIn that moment of agony,\nWhat use is regret?\n\nAlas, when such peril and distress arise,\nHow can one seek deliverance?\nOnly by swiftly reflecting on your deeds and turning back,\nCurbing greed and wrath to arouse a mind of expedient means,\nFilling the pits and leveling the trenches to foster a mind of equanimity,\nPerforming purification rites to repent transgressions,\nConcentrating your thoughts to invoke the Perfected,\nAcknowledging the Perfected Lord of your original destiny—\nOnly then will you attain peace and prosperity.\n\nHow can one behold the Perfected Lord of one’s original destiny?\nHark!\nDo not let the hordes of demons steal the mirror of your heart,\nEver let the mirror of your heart gather the hordes of demons.\n\nThe Ode says:\nLet not this one be seized by the hordes of demons,\nBattle the Three Corpses to break free from the net.\nThe waves of the bitter sea run deep—best to climb ashore,\nThe winds of the river of love blow fierce—best to ascend the slope.\nIf only you can grasp the nature of true emptiness,\nLet the myriad realms arise as they may.\nWillow green and peach red are but illusions—\nOnly fit to bow your head and laugh, hehe.\n\nWhenever you behold the true form of the Northern Dipper,\nProstrate and revere it with utmost respect.\n\nNow the Dao is originally formless,\nThus it nurtures all things and thereby takes form.\nThough it has an image,\nIt embraces the Dao and is fundamentally formless.\nThus there is the false because there is the true,\nWithout the true, there is no false.\nThe Dao conceals itself within the myriad things,\nAwakening comes only before your eyes.\nPeople cling to what lies beyond one direction,\nWhen deluded, where can they search for it?\n\nFor those who wish to learn the Dao,\nHow should they act to perceive it?\nOnly by following the good\nAnd retreating from all that is evil.\nAccumulate deeds and amass merit,\nAlign with the principle of Heaven,\nThen you will encounter an enlightened teacher,\nWho will guide you into the gate of non-action,\nAnd you will behold the mysterious and profound Dao.\n\nThus goodness and evil arise from the heart,\nThe profound principle emerges from the teacher.\nWisdom must come from oneself,\nThe Dao is revealed through the teacher’s guidance.\nThough you may meet an enlightened teacher,\nIf your own wisdom is shallow, you will not grasp the profound principle.\nYet even with keen wisdom,\nWithout a teacher, how can you fathom the subtle mysteries?\n\nO assembly, if you wish to learn the Dao,\nFirst follow goodness and retreat from evil,\nEver guard against wrongdoing.\nFrom dawn to dusk, never depart from the Dao,\nFrom moment to moment, never stray from wisdom.\n\nThus practicing in this way, the Dao is complete in all its aspects.\n\nYet common beings often lose the true Dao—why is this? Drawn outward by the ten thousand things, the five desires rage within, chasing pleasure and clinging to life, they stray from truth and lose the Dao. Therefore the Most High said: Do not cling to external appearances, lest the heart be disturbed. It is but the illusory scenes before your eyes that bring calamity in the life to come—how can one not be cautious?\n\nSeeing the false, one awakens the true heart; encountering the true, one discards false intent. Consider those who, upon beholding the true form of the Northern Dipper, bow in reverence—why do they do so? The Northern Dipper is the pivot of Heaven, and its true form is the unchanging image from ancient times. Their bowing in reverence is the sincere devotion of the human heart.\n\nThe Dao is not to be sought afar—every thing is the Dao. Those who are deluded cannot awaken; every thing becomes delusion. Thus the sage transforms beings, recognizing the true within things, so that the great Dao is grasped in the palm of the hand. Therefore the teachings are expounded to prevent the foolish from harboring perverse views, from committing transgressions, to reveal the true through the false, and to deliver those who have not yet awakened.\n\nThe origin of good and evil lies in the heart. When acting, one should weigh carefully; where one should stop, one should reflect thrice before halting. Following this progression is truly wondrous—how could it not be fitting?\n\nAh! When the karma of the heart is eradicated, the three karmas are extinguished; where the demon of the mind arises, a hundred demons are born.\n\n*Verse:*\nThe Dharma-form within the pot is originally still,\nYet it is ruined by the thief of following thoughts.\nAppearing and vanishing in Jambudvīpa, coming and going,\nDrifting and sinking in the sea of suffering, twisting and straightening.\nHow can it compare to frequently awakening to the scenes of the homeland?\nBeyond kalpas, the clouds and mountains of the mysterious reach their utmost.\nIf you wish to know the true meaning therein,\nListen to the flute by the riverbank in the deep of night.\n\nThe First Star of the Northern Dipper: Yang Brightness, Greedy Wolf, Great Star Lord—those born in the *zi* hour belong to it.\nThe Second Star: Yin Essence, Great Gate, Primal Star Lord—those born in the *chou* or *hai* hours belong to it.\nThe Third Star: True Man, Wealth-Store, True Star Lord—those born in the *yin* or *xu* hours belong to it.\nThe Fourth Star: Mysterious Darkness, Literary Curve, Pivot Star Lord—those born in the *mao* or *you* hours belong to it.\nThe Fifth Star: Cinnabar Prime, Upright Integrity, Network Star Lord—those born in the *chen* or *shen* hours belong to it.\nThe Sixth Star: Northern Pole, Martial Brilliance, Discipline Star Lord—those born in the *si* or *wei* hours belong to it.\nThe Seventh Star: Heavenly Pass, Broken Army, Pass Star Lord—those born in the *wu* hour belong to it.\nThe Eighth Star: Cave Brightness, Outer Assistant Star Lord.\nThe Ninth Star: Hidden Light, Inner Counselor Star Lord.\n\n*Verse:*\nWho knows the nine orifices mirror the Celestial Stem?\nThe turning mechanism of the numinous terrace transforms all.\nForgetting intent when it arises brings blessings,\nLightness of heart in death becomes one’s own fault.\nSilently bestow the cinnabar palace to connect with divine power,\nLoftily spread the mysterious mountain to display sacred might.\nTurning to the azure sky where clouds disperse,\nThe precious pearl shines brilliantly with radiant light.\n\nUpper Terrace: Void Essence, Opening Virtue Star Lord.\nMiddle Terrace: Sixfold Purity, Minister of Space Star Lord.\nLower Terrace: Curved Life, Controller of Fortune Star Lord.\n\n*Verse:*\nTo nurture life, one must first sever worldly dust;\nOnly by severing dust can one refine spirit and form.\nWhen the clouds over the winding river grow still, the moon turns white;\nWhen the mist in the secluded valley disperses, the mountains remain green.\nThe cinnabar lightning sleeps where the wind howls,\nThe jade pool plays where the dragon’s waters ripple.\nWhen the sacred law of the Three Terraces is fittingly invoked,\nThe six demons flee in terror, finding no place to rest.\n\nSuch are the names and titles of the True Lords—ordinarily unheard of. Those who hear and uphold them possess profound Dao-heart and deep-rooted good affinity. To hear, recite, and maintain them brings merit and power beyond measure.\n\nMoreover, the Dao of the Most Sagely is impartial, bestowing its blessings upon all beings. Wisdom varies in myriad ways, yet the original face remains without distinction. The causes of good and evil are like rain and dew, nourishing the four kinds of life and the six paths. Yet how difficult it is to ascend to the Nine Pure Heavens, how easy to sink into the Five Dark Realms—all due to the greed, attachment, ignorance, and delusion of beings.\n\nIn this fleeting life, clinging to worldly illusions, they disregard true emptiness. They take cunning and opportunism as skill, deceitful schemes as wisdom, wealth and profit as glory, and sensual pleasures as joy. Thus they lose the true Dao and are bound to eternal rebirth. Their tongues are like three-inch blades, constantly harming others; their minds are like ten-sided ambushes, ever scheming to outwit. Do they not realize that Heaven and Earth observe all, like shadows following form? The retribution of good and evil, fortune and misfortune, will surely come.\n\nO assembly, do not lament the illusory nature of human life, with its seventy years of span. Half is consumed by night, leaving but ten thousand days. Within these, half is spent in worry and rest—how much time remains? How can one bear to commit transgressions?\n\nConsider the human body: the large and small intestines are its rivers and seas, the two eyes its sun and moon, the five viscera its five sacred peaks. The head is round like Heaven, the feet square like Earth. Heaven and Earth are born through the Dao, and the human body grows by the Dao. Since the human body shares the same substance as Heaven and Earth, why do Heaven and Earth endure while the human body perishes? It is because Heaven and Earth embrace the Dao and remain tranquil. Embracing the Dao, yin and yang unite, naturally circulating above and below in ceaseless flow. The Dao harmonizes with the True One, thus they endure forever.\n\nYet the human body betrays the Dao and stirs. It depletes primordial yang, impairs the function of the Dao, and fails to preserve its true nature amid joy, anger, greed, and wrath. Deeply deluded by external realms, the yang soul wanes while the yin spirit waxes. Unaware of the principle of embracing the Dao, the four elements and hundred passages are ravaged by demons—how can it compare to the steadfastness of Heaven and Earth?\n\nTherefore, those of superior wisdom who hear these teachings, awaken to understanding, uphold, recite, and take refuge in them, possess profound Dao-heart and deep-rooted good affinity. They encounter the true teachings of the Most High’s Mysterious Gate, escape the cycle of rebirth, ascend to the ranks of immortals, forever free from the tribulations of the six paths, and transcend to the bliss of the Ten Isles. They emerge into the profoundest mystery.\n\nAlas! Having encountered the Mysterious Gate yet failing to awaken—how long will the cycles of rebirth persist?\n\n**Verse:**\nThe Mysterious Gate finds few true kin,\nNot hidden in clouds or sought in deep waves.\nBut turn back along the fragrant willow path,\nAnd emerald mists and verdant peaks appear.\nWalking, one sees mountain blossoms bloom;\nReclining, one hears wild birds sing before the hills.\nThis secluded dwelling is no distant road—\nAwakened, it is truly never apart from the heart.\n\nIf faithful men and women encounter this true scripture, their wisdom-nature becomes complete, their Dao-heart unfolds. They emerge from the paths of delusion, enter the Gate of the Inaudible and Invisible, return to the true lineage, and attain the realm of flourishing life.\n\nNow, whether one treads the gate of the utmost Dao or strays onto unvirtuous paths depends on the mind’s wisdom. When the mind reflects and corrects its errors, transgressions vanish of themselves; when wisdom awakens to truth, the Dao arises naturally. If wisdom fails to awaken to true emptiness and the mind clings to deluded paths, how can the true Dao of the Mysterious Gate ever be seen?\n\nOne must follow goodness and forsake wrongdoing, abide in stillness and depart from motion. Within stillness, sun and moon reveal another three mountains; within motion, the six paths of existence are never absent. Stillness is the origin of the immortal’s emergence; motion is the root of the mortal’s entry into dreams. Thus the wise transcend.\n\nMoreover, every action may be right or wrong, every thought and念 may be deviant or upright. Right and wrong can be discerned; deviance and uprightness can be distinguished. Between right and wrong, deviance and uprightness, one should act with calm deliberation.\n\nO assembly! Who can abandon crookedness and walk the broad Way? Who can drink deeply of virtue and power, becoming joyfully harmonious? The wise mingle with the world yet guard against wrongdoing; fools encounter true Dao yet lack right faith. If there are those of right faith and good wisdom who encounter this true scripture, their wisdom-nature becomes complete, their Dao-heart unfolds. They emerge from the paths of delusion, enter the Gate of the Inaudible and Invisible, return to the true lineage, and attain the realm of flourishing life.\n\n**Wisdom-nature complete** means:\n*Wisdom*: The eyes see the myriad things, the body dwells amid the dust, yet the nature does not arise in chaos, the mind does not cling—this is wisdom.\n*Insight*: The functioning of the Two Modes, the true emptiness of the Three Mysteries—nothing hidden is not illuminated, no transformation is not penetrated—this is insight.\n*Nature*: The spirit that abides through kalpas’ end and beginning, ever present and enduring.\n*Complete*: Perfectly fused awareness, unimpeded and all-penetrating truth—this is the unfolding of the Dao-heart and sudden awakening to the true Dao. Naturally, one emerges from the paths of delusion, enters the Gate of the Inaudible and Invisible, returns to the lineage of the True One, and attains the realm of eternal life and flourishing joy.\n\nWhen the dust-nature is not eliminated, the three disasters arise together; when the Dao-heart unfolds, the six desires all dissolve.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe Dharma-mirror, radiant, veils the jeweled terrace;\nDo not tarry, lest dust defile it.\nSuddenly the wondrous Dao opens in true purity,\nShedding deluded paths and transforming sorrow into joy.\nRealizing that conditioned existence has its uses,\nOne follows the teaching where there is neither going nor coming.\nIf the message of the Dao is truly awakened,\nIts wondrous form and numinous power surpass the nine heavens.\n\nOn the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, one’s natal day, and the days beneath the Northern Dipper, one should solemnly prepare the altar, recite the scriptures, and perform the fast and rites according to the proper forms. The blessings are boundless, spanning lifetimes without end, never straying from true nature or falling into deviant views.\n\nThough iron ore is stubborn, through smelting it becomes a vessel; though the human heart is desirous, through embracing virtue and power and forsaking wrongdoing, it may be corrected. Ore unrefined never becomes a vessel; a person unrefined never becomes true. Thus, only through the master craftsman does one awaken, and only through virtue and power does one come to know emptiness.\n\nThe Dao is the origin of the myriad things; virtue is the source of the hundred practices. Thus the profound benefits of virtue and power pervade all—how few among the multitudes know their daily use!\n\nThough the Dao is formless, it may be seen by forsaking desire; though virtue has its mirror, it is not perfected without accumulating goodness. Those who aspire to the Dao yet do not see its nature—how can they be true? Those who establish virtue yet do not cultivate its practice—how can they be benevolent?\n\nAll who cultivate Dao and virtue must embrace purity and truth, guard stillness, fill the belly and empty the heart, yield to others, and humble themselves with reverence. Without following these principles, those who study the Dao and cultivate truth will ultimately fail.\n\nBefore attaining the Dao, the mortal’s illusory body and nature arise from unequal good and evil, disparate fortune and misfortune—all governed by the celestial and terrestrial bureaus, officials who oversee life and death, punishing transgressions and rewarding goodness. Thus, on the Eight Festivals, the Three Primes, one’s natal day, and beneath the Northern Dipper, one should solemnly prepare the altar, recite the scriptures, perform the fast and rites, contemplate truth, invoke the Dao, repent transgressions, and pray for blessings. Thus sins will surely be erased, blessings will surely descend, one will not stray from true nature or fall into deviant views, and may preserve one’s heavenly years, attaining the Dao and enduring forever.\n\nIf one is submerged in deviant views, one strays from truth; straying from truth, one corrupts the Dao; corrupting the Dao, sins arise; sins arising, the form perishes.\n\nAlas! Through the madness of the inch-long heart, one falls into the river of delusion; trusting the six thieves’ deceptive clamor, one is ensnared in the net of karma. How much better to refine a single grain of golden elixir, shedding the illusory transformations of the four births, attaining freedom beyond the world, merging with the Dao in truth, at ease in the profoundest mystery, without hindrance or obstruction.\n\n**Verse:**\nWithin the body lies another numinous realm,\nIts perfect fusion named the Profound and Obscure.\nSight and hearing know not its form,\nYet through the mysterious, it ever unites with the spirit.\nThe laurel moon hangs as a bright mirror,\nThe pine-clad mountain leans as an emerald screen.\nHigh and low, the mountain moon is unobstructed—\nAll is forgotten, the two forms dissolved.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture should constantly recite the honorific titles of the Seven True Lords of the Primes. When their merit is complete, auspicious blessings will descend.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThere exists another majestic realm,\nUnobstructed, unconditioned, naturally at ease.\nNot a trace of worldly dust lingers in the heart—\nSeated, one feels the protection and love of the myriad spirits.\n\n**On the Mysteries of the Daoist Gate for All Disciples**\n\nAll within the Daoist gate should attend carefully to these matters. Those who cultivate the Real must focus on the root, for when the root is established, the Dao remains unharmed. Without knowing the root of the Dao, how can one reach the Jasper Pool? Thus the noble person attends to the root, and when the root is established, the Dao arises. To seek the mysteries of the Dao, first secure the root. With the root firm, seeking the Real is easy; seeking the Real while losing the root is difficult. Only when both root and Real are perfected does one arrive at the homeland of the Dao.\n\nMoreover, non-action relies upon action. Thus, knowing the root exists in the manifest, one distinguishes it from the unmanifest. To recognize the root, one must first identify its essence. Once this essence is discerned and broken through, the ears and eyes become keen. The true and wondrous transformation has always resided within one’s own body.\n\nKnow that striking stone produces fire, and digging earth creates a deep abyss. To cultivate blessings, act with goodness; to sever karmic causes, cut off conditions. To quench thirst, one must have water; to resist cold, one must have silk. To advance in the Real and attain the Dao, guard against transgressions and avoid faults.\n\nIf one can diligently recite and uphold the teachings, meditate on the Dao, and contemplate the Real—without regressing in virtuous practice—then when merit is complete and deeds fulfilled, auspicious blessings will gather and descend. The spirit will be bathed in carefree ease, and one shall forever enjoy the Great Mystery.\n\nAh!\nThough the fair scenes of the Three Isles are much praised,\nThe heart filled with wind and moon is yet more serene.\n\n**Verse:**\nLofty towers and splendid halls well forth with numinous springs,\nWithin dwells the Cinnabar Sovereign, named the Natural.\nThe Primordial Chaos unfolds into lush abundance,\nThe Void Cauldron of Gold revolves with true mystery.\nThe yang spirit guards and stabilizes the land of Three Clarities,\nThe yin soul subdues and captures the Six Cavern Heavens.\nDo not be deluded by illusory dreams at your pillow’s edge,\nLest the cold moon fill the fisherman’s boat in solitude.\n\nThen follows the incantation of the Northern Dipper:\n\nNorthern Dipper of the Nine Luminaries, great deities of the central heavens,\nAbove you ascend to the Golden Palace, below you cover Kunlun.\nYou regulate the cosmic order, govern the cosmos.\nGreat Dipper, Greedy Wolf, Gigantic Gate, Store of Emolument,\nLiterary Brilliance, Integrity and Chastity, Martial Brilliance, Breaker of Armies.\nSupreme Jade Emperor, Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord,\nEncompassing the great celestial sphere, entering even the tiniest dust.\nWhat disaster cannot be eradicated? What blessing cannot be attained?\nThe primal qi of the Original Sovereign comes to merge with my body.\nWherever the Celestial Stem points, it revolves day and night without cease.\nThe common folk, petty and unenlightened, seek the Dao and crave numinous power.\nMay they behold your august presence and forever preserve long life.\nThe Three Terraces of Void Essence, the Six Pure Ones of Curved Birth,\nGive birth to me, nurture me, protect my body and form.\n[...] Venerable Emperor, swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!\n\n**Verse:**\nThe Mysterious Female’s pivot and mechanism array the transforming spirits,\nOffering ascent to the Real and bathing in vast grace.\nAuspicious mists block the path of hesitation,\nThe new moon opens the gate of joyous ease.\nThe upright qi gathers life, pacifying Yu and Ji,\nThe numinous source protects and nurtures, revolving Kunlun.\nThe Seven Primes, undimmed, radiate their luminous glow,\nThe myriad sages draw near to guard my honor.\n\nLord Laozi said: The nature, life, and five constituents of all people are entirely governed by the star officials of their original destiny. The spirit-generals of their original destiny and the star officials of their natal constellation constantly bestow their protective shade, sustaining life and preserving one’s allotted years. Yet the common folk, ignorant, pass their lives without awakening.\n\nThe true officials of one’s original destiny descend to the human realm six times each year. The day of descent is called the *limit-period of original destiny*. On that day, three thousand messengers of the Southern Mound and seven thousand spirit-generals of the Northern Dipper, along with the true officials of original destiny, descend in the company of all the perfected to surround and protect.\n\nMoreover, the Dao nurtures the root of heaven and earth, and qi supplements the functions of the Five Phases. Things steal the numinous essence of heaven and earth to flourish, while humans steal the essence of the myriad things to seek stability. Thus the Three Powers and Five Phases, human relationships, destiny, and all things cannot be born without the Dao, nor can they stand without it. All things in the universe do not transcend the Great Dao.\n\nTherefore, the Dao embraces the myriad phenomena. When humans awaken to the One Mind, the myriad phenomena propagate through the scriptures—yet they do not arise from outside the Dao. The One Mind transforms and operates, and nothing is more substantial than the Real. Those who wish to learn the Dao and return to the Real, to cultivate the body and preserve their nature, must attend to what is real and true.\n\nHeaven can indeed be moved by the sun and moon, earth can indeed bear the numinous beings, and humans, among all the worlds, can naturally accomplish the true and perfect Dao, achieving the untainted.\n\nThus, with a true heart and sincere practice, the Dao is never empty in its realization of the Real. But if one’s heart is stubborn and unrepentant, how can sacred merit reach the gate of the Mystery? All practices must be grounded in true effort, for the great Dao of our Mystery Ultimate operates through the Real.\n\nAlas! The floating world deludes people, who regard it as false. Alas! Shallow-rooted beings of meager practice—how could they believe the Daoist gate holds other profound and wondrous principles? They only delight in sensual pleasures, compete for fleeting wealth, and take pride in riches. They speak perversely and vie to hear contentious words. When they hear of true emptiness, they react with arrogance, slandering the Daoist gate as if it were mud and sand. They covet what is not theirs and forget their nature and life. The wondrous principles of the Mysterious Real are veiled by ten thousand layers of mist and water. In the bitter sea of delusion, when will they cross to the shore of the Dao?\n\nBecause the common people are ignorant and do not awaken to themselves, the Most High opens his golden mouth of non-action, spitting forth the mysterious pearl to aid all things. He points out the path to the Three Heavens and blocks the gateless Nine Nights. Benefiting all beings, his grace moistens all ranks. He guides the most excellent to become celestial perfected, leads the middling and lesser to return to the correct Dao, teaches the Three Vehicles, and transmits the scriptures of ten thousand transformations.\n\nThis is because the seed-nature of beings differs, and their faculties vary. To convert those of superior roots, the superior vehicle is taught. But there are those of middling and lesser capacity who cannot grasp this principle. For them, binding the heart and refining the nature, silently and wordlessly applying the Dao, advancing the formless principle, and yearning for the imageless Real—none but those of superior roots can comprehend this.\n\nThus the middle and lesser vehicles use external conditions to reveal the inner Real, expounding the manifest to distinguish the untainted.\n\nAs for the true officials of original destiny descending six times each year to the human realm, this refers to the days corresponding to the sixty-year cycle of one’s birth year—these are the *original destiny days*. Each year, there are six occasions when one’s original destiny aligns, which are the *descent days of original destiny*. On these days, the star officials of one’s natal constellation and the spirit-generals of one’s original destiny descend to the world to observe good and evil. Accompanied by three thousand messengers of the Southern Mound and seven thousand spirit-generals of the Northern Dipper, they all come to surround and protect.\n\nOn these days, one should practice abstinence, recite scriptures, repent, and pray for expiation. Revering the host of perfected and honoring one’s original destiny will dissolve calamities and misfortunes, extending one’s years and destiny.\n\nThe three thousand messengers of the Southern Mound are likened to the image of *li* fire, the three yang of the Cinnabar Yang Palace forming the three hun-souls. When activated, the numinous spirit is born and presides over the heart. The heart can restrain the form and spirit, preventing disorder.\n\nThe seven thousand spirit-generals of the Northern Dipper take the form of *kan* water, the abode of black yin. The seven essences open the seven orifices; when unobstructed, radiance pervades and governs the kidneys. The kidneys can securely guard the essence and qi, preventing their dissipation.\n\nThese are the loci of the original true within the human body. When the true origin resides in the valley, the Three Corpses, Seven Po, Six Desires, and Nine Worms all follow the Dao, and the myriad spirits and host of perfected come to surround and protect. This is the reality of the Dao.\n\nAh! If one comprehends the subtle message of the Great Mystery, Mount Tai transforms into the Jade Capital Mountain.\n\nA hymn says:\nThe shore of the River of Love is vast, waves delude the heavens,\nBest to withdraw and board the Dharma boat.\nRestrain the playful monkey to sleep on the herb-strewn path,\nLet the willful horse roam the fragrant fields.\nPenetrating the profound principle, the Dao is everywhere,\nAwakening to the subtle mechanism, Chan is in all places.\nOn a moonlit night, chanting alone, hoist the oar,\nThe homeland shimmers before the ancient peaks.\n\nThis can dissolve calamities, repent sins, invoke blessings, and extend life. According to one’s capacity, perform rites and offerings, and merit and virtue will increase.\n\nIf the term of one’s original destiny is approaching and one remains unaware, failing to establish abstinence rites or tend incense and fire, this is to trifle with life and be deluded about one’s origin, not cherishing the human form. The celestial offices will revoke one’s emoluments, diminish one’s allotted years, and often lead to premature death.\n\nThose who err in this way, even if they encounter scriptural instructions, harbor disbelief and slander the true texts. After such persons pass away, they sink into the Three Wretched Realms, drift through the various destinies, and forever lose the human form. Deeply pitiable, they bring this suffering upon themselves.\n\nJust as one seeks smoke near wood or quenches thirst near a spring, one shuns wrongdoing to draw near goodness and flees folly to approach wisdom. Wood’s nature is not fiery, yet drilling it produces flame; the human heart pursues desires, yet restraint gives rise to the Dao. Without the worthy, do not debate folly; without a spring, do not slake thirst; without the upright, do not recognize the perverse; without the true, do not know the false. By the false, the true is revealed; by the perverse, the upright is known.\n\nFor instance, the Jade Terrace suspends a precious mirror, its radiance resplendent within. How can you, possessing a bodily form, hold the profound mystery of the Great Dao yet remain devoid of it? The precious mirror is the original true; what appears within it is the illusory bodily form. The true is concealed within the false. One should polish the heart-mirror to remove even the finest speck of dust. When one’s nature harmonizes with the Dao, it pervades the ten thousand realms. The Great Dao encompasses all things; when one’s nature is contained, the mind is never disordered. Once one knows the ten thousand things to be false, the solitary mind alone illumines the true. If one grasps and uses things, there is no way to delight in the Dao; if one departs from things in speech, there is no path to ascend to heaven. This is like gazing toward the sea’s edge and suddenly beholding the osmanthus moon, or strolling a mountain path and instantly sensing the pine wind. Through aversion, one may follow goodness; through the false, one may know the true. Through the ordinary, one knows the sage; through the sprout, one knows the root.\n\nMoreover, the common people in the world, the multitude of beings, do not use false things to point to the true—how then can they discern forms? Without using dharmic appearances to transmit emptiness, how can they recognize the formless? Thus, the sages bestow transformation for the sake of the unenlightened.\n\nTherefore, the Most High said: “Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.”\n\nIf all of us, the multitude of beings, awaken to this Great Dao, know the term of our original destiny, and advance along the immortal’s steps by upholding this profound scripture with unwavering dedication, our merit and virtue will naturally increase.\n\nIf one does not progress in the mysterious work but is instead one who trifles with life and abandons destiny, one’s inherent nature will enter another bodily form, the heart will gather myriad sorrows like ashes, and when will the river of karma become clear? One will be bound and imprisoned in the iron domain—how can one ever rest?\n\nBetter to rely on a single wisdom to ascend the heavenly path; do not follow the Three Corpses to become a prisoner of the earth.\n\nA hymn says:\nPractice the true according to your capacity, and you will see the true;\nArduous cultivation requires diligence from the outset.\nOne must undertake genuine and steadfast practice\nTo enter the gate of non-action and attain freedom.\nThe sea of karma has no thousand-mile shore,\nThe Penglai Mountains are obscured by ten thousand layers of clouds.\nWhere the fisherman’s lamp shines, the cold river is still,\nGulls and egrets take startled flight, losing their former flock.\n\nIf on the days of one’s original destiny one performs abstinence rites and communicates with the celestial offices, within the term of one’s original destiny one may open and transmit the true scripture, widely present offerings, and thereby ensure that for three lifetimes one will always be reborn as a man, wealthy, noble, intelligent, and preeminent among people.\n\nIt is said that emotions arise from things, perceptions from the mind. When desire and emotion arise, the Three Mountains become Fengdu; when desire and emotion cease, the Nine Nights become the Mysterious Mansion. Generally, why do the host of demons and myriad sufferings come? Why do the Eight Difficulties and Ten Entanglements arise? Desires are the root of the host of demons and myriad sufferings; disordered nature is the chief of the Eight Difficulties and Ten Entanglements. Desire has no root—it is the eye that leads desire; demons have no hindrance—it is the heart that gives rise to demons. Thus, the five tones deafen the ears, and the five colors blind the eyes.\n\nThe *Yin Fu Jing* states: “The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in seeing. Cut off the source of profit, and your forces are tenfold; reverse this three times day and night, and your forces are ten thousandfold.”\n\nAll the myriad conditions and thousand practices arise from the single heart.\n\nIt is also said: The green willows and red peaches are illusory transformations before one’s eyes; the clear wind and white moon are the livelihood beyond the kalpa. If one silently illuminates the Great Tenuity, the spirit is born in the Cinnabar Palace; if one is deluded by worldly desires, the po-soul falls into the Cold Pool. The myriad dusts and leaks, the ten thousand kinds and ends—one need only recognize the original within the false and seek the substantial appearance within the formless. Then one may practice the Great Dao.\n\nOh, the assembly! The present circumstances are vast and multifarious, the delusions of worldly states are endless. The seven emotions and six desires, the five ghosts and three corpses, transform into demons to deceive you into the river of delusion, using worldly pleasures to lure you into the sea of karma. All manner of calamities descend—how can one bear them? One must only subdue the heart, and the host of demons will submit; restrain desire, and the myriad sufferings will dissolve. When the heart is extinguished, the ten thousand dharmas are extinguished; when emotions arise, the myriad sufferings arise. Entering the mysterious gate of the Dao, the night palace of the hidden pass, the path is fundamentally one, yet one may walk two ways. The numinous spirit shines, opening the light of the Nine Nights; the po-soul scatters, darkening the Three Mountains. The joys of heaven, the imprisonment of hell, the fruits of wrongdoing, the causes of good acts—all transform according to the spirit-terrace and manifest from wisdom and nature.\n\nIf there are sentient beings who understand the principle of their original destiny, purify themselves through fasting and precepts, and extinguish the leaks of worldly dust, their meritorious deeds will ascend to the heavenly courts, granting them dignified and majestic countenances, attaining the rank of Perfected Ones, and crossing beyond the sea of suffering—all because they subdued the heart and overcame demons, embraced goodness and renounced evil, thus ascending to the carefree immortal realms, avoiding the shackles of dark prisons.\n\nFor those who uphold the scriptures and cultivate the Dao, following the texts of the Most High and transgressing none of the sacred prohibitions, attaining the Dao and becoming immortals, they receive the grace of the ancient sages. How shall they repay this? As the *Song of Realizing the Dao* says: \"To grind one’s bones to powder is still insufficient repayment; a single thought of clarity transcends kalpas beyond count.\"\n\nOne must only yearn for the Dao with clarity, purifying the heart until it is free of defilement—this is to not betray the principle of heaven and earth.\n\nHark!\nChisel open the stone wall, and no barrier remains;\nThe ten thousand images and all phenomena appear within the palm.\n\nA eulogy says:\nThe mysterious and numinous, in great compassion, delivers from the cage;\nBroadly transforming the Three Vehicles to awaken to the Great Void.\nBefore your eyes, you know what to take and use—\nDo not seek traces in the clouds where others speak.\n\nThe peach-laden Han and willow-lined shores are your family’s affairs;\nThe osmanthus moon and pine winds are the legacy of my ancestors.\nHow laughable are those many Dao-seekers\nWho chase after worldly scenes, running east and west.\n\nFor those whose karmic endowment is meager, though born among humans, poor and lowly, even if they understand their original destiny but lack the means to cultivate, if they can pour water or offer flowers, silently turn their minds toward the Northern Culmen, bow in reverence, and invoke the name of their Original Destiny True Lord, they shall not pass their destined lifespan in vain. All will gain extended life and recorded blessings, securing human rebirth in every generation, dispelling calamities, and obtaining boundless fortune.\n\nThe Heavenly Master rejoiced, leapt with joy, and bowed in reverence, praising the rare encounter with this supreme Dharma-bridge.\n\nNow, the nature of water is perfectly level, yet waves arise with the wind; the human heart is originally still, but movement arises from external things. When things do not cling, emotions do not arise; when the heart remains empty, desires naturally fade. Love and desire arise from the heart, while form and spirit are lost to external things. Adrift in the boundless sea of karma without returning to shore, one drifts at will; dimly traversing the paths of Fengdu, one follows perilous routes—only when the time is lost does one awaken, like propping up a shadow at noon to guard against sorrow.\n\nO assembly! Greed, infatuation, delusion, stinginess, and miserliness—how pitiful that foolish people do not awaken! These are the causes of losing one’s nature and life, the roots of straying from the true mystery. Worldly pleasures and blind attachment bring no benefit; the opening of the Dao-heart is our true glory. Clouds and mist in secluded caves idle away the light of sun and moon; ornate pavilions and splendid halls reveal the changes of stars and frost. Beyond the world, apart from dust, there is another realm of carefree wandering—how can the fleeting vanities and worldly pleasures of the mundane realm be free from harm?\n\nThose who cultivate truth and refine their nature must, within the twelve hours and one hundred moments of each day, in all actions whether moving or still, keep body and mind pure, always establishing expedient means. Naturally, merits and deeds will accumulate, goodness will reach the Three Heavens, and one will ascend to Perfection and attain the Dao.\n\nThus, the Most High has said: \"Advancing goodness is like stealing.\" Therefore, in the dusty world, one harmonizes with light and follows the times, establishing goodness according to conditions. If one speaks of goodness but does not practice it, the gate to realizing the Dao remains closed; if one sees wrongdoing and can renounce it, the path to ascending as a Perfected One lies open.\n\nThose who wish to cultivate truth and learn immortality must establish truthful conduct. Though in the world, poverty and nobility, high and low, each have their distinctions, the Great Dao and true emptiness are truly without differentiation. Some advance the Dao through solemn wisdom and a pure heart; some set up banners and arrange images to pray for blessings. Though the methods differ, all lead to the same path. While worldly conditions vary between wealth and poverty, the heart of heaven makes no distinction between high and low. If one can arouse a single thought of advancing the Dao and doing good, externally, the celestial and terrestrial spirits will protect them; internally, their original destiny, form, and spirit will delight. Naturally, calamities will be dispelled, and boundless fortune obtained.\n\nAt this time, the Heavenly Master received this scripture, overflowing with joy.\n\nThe Heavenly Master is one who upholds the Dao and assists rectitude—thus called the Teacher of Heaven. Those who stray from the true and pursue the perverse are called ghosts of the earth. Therefore, those who awaken to the Great Dao of truth may truly be said to have encountered the supreme Dharma-bridge.\n\nHark!\nOne spirit upholds rectitude, free of deceit;\nThe Three Realms’ carefree wandering all lie within.\n\nA Hymn says:\nThe willow-lined shore distinctly spans the Dharma-bridge,\nYet deluded, one finds the path as distant as can be.\nMist drifts o’er riverbanks where mountain hues grow faint,\nSunlight bathes the secluded hamlet, wild hues fade away.\nFortunate indeed—originally free from clinging forms,\nYet forced today to speak of ceaseless woe.\nWho knows how many in the human realm turn back their gaze?\nMoonlit and wind-clear, I alone beckon.\n\n*Taishang Xuanling Beidou Benming Yansheng Zhenjing Zhujie*, Scroll Middle\n1. \"皈依\" (*guīyī*)—same as in the *Jingzhu* edition; the *Zhenjing Zhu* writes \"归真\" (*guīzhēn*).\n2. \"虽还明师\" (*suī huán míngshī*)—should read \"虽遇明师\" (*suī yù míngshī*).\n3. \"而矣\" (*ér yǐ*)—likely should read \"中矣\" (*zhōng yǐ*).\n\n*Taishang Xuanling Beidou Benming Yansheng Zhenjing Zhujie*, Scroll Lower\nCommentary and Hymns by Xuanyuan Zhenren of Kongtong Mountain\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao further addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: The sins and blessings, good and evil of worldly people all fall under the governance of celestial offices. To repent of sins and dispel calamities, nothing surpasses cultivation and reverence. On one’s original destiny’s birthday, at the life-mandate’s mid-cycle, at the Horse of the Year, or during the Three Disasters and Nine Calamities, one may safeguard the present and ensure the well-being of one’s kin.\n\nOriginally, Heaven and Earth bore no form, and the Dao lay hidden in primordial chaos. Before the sun and moon took shape, qi resided within the Great Simplicity. When one qi sufficed, the Yellow Center governed; when the Great Simplicity dispersed, the myriad things began to arise. The Three Powers spread transformation among the host of spirits; the Six Movements breathed through the bellows. Cold and heat shifted in alternation; the pitch-pipes harmonized in resonance. Above, the radiance of sun and moon scattered, arraying the stars; below, the clear and turbid sediments congealed, forming hills and mountains. All things were born and nurtured; all beings flourished and multiplied. Yet when humans plunder the myriad things to attain peace, things deplete humans to attain the Dao. Spring’s luxuriance yields to autumn’s decline; there is birth, and thus there is death. If one remains formless and imageless, there is no death, nor any end.\n\nThe multitude’s eyelashes are not distant from their eyes, yet they fail to see clearly. The Great Dao lies solely within the heart—how could one cultivate it without recognition? Cloud-palace and Brahma-towers, jewel gardens and soaring forests—through form one discerns the formless; by relying on conditioned causes, one knows the unconditioned. Through action one attains non-action; through form one achieves formlessness. The numinous terrace, undimmed, reflects the Dao’s clarity; dust accumulates, obscuring the spirit’s radiance. When the numinous wanes and essence scatters, the body sickens and perishes. The three hun drift into the vast, empty paths of the yin realm—oh, how boundless! The hundred joints and bodily frame lie scattered upon the desolate mounds—how desolate! Though one may rival the wealth of a kingdom, what glory remains today? Though one may bear the empty title of six seals, what benefit does it bring in the end?\n\nThe world’s deluded cling to desire, losing their original destiny; they indulge in greed, exhausting their Horses of the Year. Their eyes follow peach-red and willow-green, unaware of the source of emptiness and form; their minds chase butterflies and blossoms, unable to distinguish the divisions of causes and conditions. In the vast expanse of the sea, within the swirling vortex, how long will they drift? In the deep recesses of mountains, within the cloud-caves of stone, when will their frantic scurrying cease?\n\nYet worldly people abhor dampness and dwell below; they fear death and cling to life. They do not know that life is the root of death, and transgression the head of misfortune. One ought to fear dampness and dwell on high; cling to life yet transcend death; dread misfortune and guard against transgression; prevent calamity and refrain from wrongdoing. Naturally, one becomes a carefree immortal of the earthly realm.\n\nMoreover, when sentient beings commit wrongs and violate prohibitions, their transgressions accumulate—what method can absolve them? What means can avert them? It lies in repenting past wrongs, forever severing future errors, and wholeheartedly contemplating the Great Mystery. Reverently and diligently honoring the mid-cycle of one’s own life-mandate and the Horse of the Year, one may shed the Three Disasters and Nine Calamities, safeguarding the present and ensuring the well-being of one’s kin.\n\nWhat is the life-mandate’s mid-cycle, the Horse of the Year?\nThe *yuan* is the beginning; the *chen* is the true image; the *yi* is the dwelling-valley; the *ma* is the stubborn beast. To invoke blessings, one must pray and supplicate, seeking the original beginning, aligning with the Great Dao, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, moving with the sun and moon, equaling the mountains, penetrating the profound and attaining the mysterious—non-action without hindrance. This *yuanchen* repents of transgressions and turns toward virtue, thereby dispelling calamities and transcending misfortune.\n\nIf one can bind the mind-monkey within the dwelling-valley of the self, restraining the will-horse, naturally the myriad disasters will not encroach, and the host of demons will bow in submission. Then one attains carefree wandering through the Three Realms, realizing the Mystery of Mysteries.\n\nHark!\nOnly when the self’s Horse of the Year is captured and subdued\nMay the original destiny shed the Nine Calamities.\n\nA Hymn says:\nStrike not the original spirit upon the Five Aggregates’ mountain,\nFor within it, illusory affairs abound in difficulty.\nDeluded clouds often cling to the numinous terrace’s companion;\nLove’s waves surge repeatedly within the cinnabar palace.\nThe Nine Calamities gradually arise as the monkey and horse flourish;\nThe Three Disasters turn and stir as ghosts and demons grow stubborn.\nWho knows the true message revealed in illumination?\nWind and moon, serene and untouched, remain undisturbed.\n\nWhenever superior practitioners uphold this true scripture on their original destiny’s birthday, they externally subdue demonic spirits and internally pacify their true nature. Their merit extends to the water and land realms; their goodness reaches both the living and the deceased. Through repentance and reverence, they gradually ascend to wondrous fruition, reestablish mysterious merit, and realize the Dao of Emptiness. Thus they attain sagely wisdom and perfect penetration, becoming unfathomable in concealment or manifestation, moving freely between being and non-being, wandering carefree among the clouds, ascending through the Golden Gate to unite with the sages. Their bodies transcend the Three Realms, forever freed from the wheel of rebirth, their lifespan boundless, their joy and ease self-attained.\n\nMoreover, the distinctions between good and evil all arise from one’s actions; the two paths of fortune and misfortune truly stem from one’s conduct. Generally, when illusory demons run rampant, transgressions inevitably accumulate; when the karma of the heart is extinguished, sins also perish. Though one knows that good and evil, fortune and misfortune follow like shadows after form, they cannot be escaped.\n\nYet the common worldly multitudes do not know what is most intimate or what is greatest. Though they know only the Dao is greatest and only destiny most intimate—now that they recognize the Dao’s greatness and destiny’s intimacy, how should they seek it? How should they protect it? One must know that the hub arises from the wheel, and the net from its cords. With a single mind embracing rectitude, the myriad dharmas remain free from deviation. If one cannot respect what is intimate, how can one respect what is distant? If one cannot delight in what is internal, how can one delight in what is external? Thus, respecting the intimate naturally extends to the distant; delighting in the internal naturally radiates outward. Therefore, one may rectify the self, and all things will naturally follow without command.\n\nWhat is intimate cannot be disrespected; what is external cannot be delighted in without first delighting within. Thus, reverence for the intimate ensures goodness toward the distant; inner joy naturally extends outward. Therefore, one may rectify the self, and all things will naturally follow without coercion.\n\n○ O assembly! Like dragons roaring and tigers howling, ascending and descending within the cinnabar crucible; like ghosts wailing and spirits shrieking, fleeing in terror beyond the Yellow Court—thus may one attain the Dao of emptiness and formlessness, with boundless longevity, joyous freedom, and carefree wandering through the Three Realms. Ascend through the Golden Gate to unite with the sages and merge with the True.\n\nHark! The body arrives at the misty moonlit banks of Qu Brook, where the hues of Mount Chu’s peaks grow ever clearer.\n\n*Verse:*\nBy the Jade Void Terrace, primal unity once reigned,\nUnobstructed, uncontrived—eternally the same.\nYet deluded by passions within birth and death,\nBound to true awakening’s comings and goings.\nAll cling to being, only to grasp at being,\nThough leaning on emptiness, they still fall into void.\nWhen emptiness and being are mirrored in the square inch of the heart,\nNaturally, the divine powers unfold in endless display.\n\nWhenever men or women, on their life-destiny birthdays or during various fast days, purify body and mind, burn incense, and hold this true scripture, recognizing the Star Lord of their life-destiny at the Northern Culmen and praying with sincerity, no good shall go unanswered. Disasters and transgressions will dissolve, and ten thousand sages and thousand perfected ones will all come to guard and protect. Wherever this scripture resides, a thousand perfected pay reverence, ten thousand sages offer protection. Demons and ghosts vanish in silence, spirits and sprites hide in submission. All worldly calamities and misfortunes shall be utterly dispelled.\n\nMoreover, the Great Dao is hard to name; its mysterious workings are unfathomable. Its vast grace spreads over the ten thousand things; its wondrous transformations pervade the eight directions. All ranks partake in its bounty; no being is left unsupported. Yet the Dao bears all without exception, bestowing the grace of utility; things thus come to life and flourish, unfolding the transformation of non-doing.\n\nIt is also said:\nThe emptiness of utility is not utility;\nNon-doing as form—how could it be non-doing?\nTo grasp the principle within use and non-use\nIs to escape the wheel of rebirth and end sighs of sorrow.\nKnow then that heaven and earth cover and bear with boundless grace;\nSun and moon illumine with equal grace.\nThe Dao’s transformed bodies—who would not cherish them?\nYet men know not that the body is the state,\nThat life is the sovereign,\nThat the spirit is the root,\nThat qi is the minister.\nLost in delusion, they are bewildered by the five colors;\nFollowing craving, they are ensnared by the six dusts.\n\nOne must know:\nWhen the sovereign loves and respects the state, it prospers;\nWhen spirit and qi harmonize and surge, the body does not perish.\nWhen ministers are loyal to the sovereign and the sovereign loves the ministers,\nThe household and nation from this turn to flourishing.\nThough barbarians may be fierce and bold,\nNone dare wage war.\nIn general, harmony brings peace;\nRectitude subdues evil.\nWith a single thought stilled, the ten thousand conditions are forgotten.\nIf a single thought of causation arises,\nOne incurs the retribution of the Three Wretched Realms—\nPast, future, and present;\nAbandoning the body, repaying the body, receiving the body.\nDeluded, one knows not the crossing of the abyss;\nGreedy, one knows not the climbing of the steep ridge.\nStolid as if dumb, dazed as if dreaming,\nKindling the fire of ignorance,\nBurning and destroying the splendor of the jeweled tower.\nLeaking through the ford of delusion,\nScattering and dissipating the principle of true origin.\nThus are the multitudes of beings vast indeed.\n\nWhenever men or women, on their life-destiny birthdays or during various fast days, purify body and mind, burn true incense, hold and recite this true scripture, recognizing the Star Lord of their life-destiny at the Northern Culmen and praying with sincerity, no good shall go unanswered. Disasters and transgressions will dissolve; ghosts and demons will hide in submission. May all sentient beings together escape the fruits of karmic action!\n\nHark! The Seven Perfected seek in vain for a place to relieve suffering—\nWhen a single thought is forgotten, another heaven appears.\n\nHymn says:\nTen thousand layered cloud-mountains rise in emerald splendor,\nThe homeward path is clear—how could it ever err?\nYet who knows this foreign land is fair?\nNone heed that in the end it is not their true home.\n\nTo relinquish attachment is true repentance,\nTo forget greed is the great cinnabar elixir.\nSubduing the heart, one enters the subtle path—\nSmiling to see the creek-wind bear fallen blossoms.\n\nThis is called *The Northern Culmen Life-Prolonging Scripture’s Key*,\nThe very path of cultivating truth.\nAll who attain the Dao and roam freely do so through this scripture,\nAll who verify sageliness and achieve perfection do so through this scripture,\nAll who escape birth and death do so through this scripture,\nAll who protect men and women do so through this scripture.\nTo preserve life and extend years is to gain mastery—\nForever a treasure for the body,\nWhere fortune and longevity may be proclaimed.\nGuard and revere it;\nShow it not to the unworthy.\n\nAll who cultivate the Dao rely upon the principle of preserving truth and refining nature.\nThus, those who obscure their nature bring upon themselves manifold misfortunes,\nWhile those who awaken to truth know boundless blessings.\nGood and evil actions arise solely from the heart;\nFortune and misfortune are discerned solely through wisdom.\nFor the common person in the world,\nEvery thought, every deed, every movement and repose,\nFortune and misfortune, good and evil,\nIntermingle and intertwine.\nDiscernment lies in wisdom:\nWhen encountering good, advance and follow it;\nWhen meeting evil, retreat and guard against it.\nTo retreat from evil is to establish merit;\nTo guard against wrongdoing is to preserve virtue.\nThus may one enter the Mystery Gate.\n\nEmpty words of forsaking evil, without establishing true merit,\nIdle talk of advancing good, without practicing true virtue—\nHow can one attain the Gate of the Invisible and Inaudible,\nOr comprehend the principle of nature and appearance?\n\nThe sages bequeathed scriptures like the radiance of sun and moon,\nDispelling darkness, revealing all things,\nIlluminating every direction,\nEnabling all beings to know what they knew not,\nTo see what they had not seen.\nSuch is the virtue of Heaven.\n\nOur Most High expounded this scripture and teaching, like sun and moon,\nEnabling all to know the path of ascending to truth and entering the Dao,\nThe way to escape the wheel of suffering and rebirth.\nSuch is the virtue of the sages.\n\nThe nature of all beings is akin to sun and moon,\nPervading the great void, unstained by the tiniest dust,\nSoaring through empty space without hindrance.\nYet they know not the principle of establishing merit and cultivating virtue.\nObstructions arise like clouds,\nAfflictions and karma stir,\nTheir luminous clarity is obscured,\nAnd they wander into darkness.\nGreed-blinded, they heed not the peril of the pit ahead;\nPursuing pleasure, they forget the sorrows of future calamity.\n\nO assembly! How much better to establish merit and cultivate virtue,\nWhose blessings are beyond measure!\nThey can deliver suffering souls,\nEternally prolong destiny,\nEscape birth and death,\nAttain the Dao and roam freely,\nVerify sageliness and achieve perfection,\nAscend to the Three Clarities’ realm!\n\nHark!\nThe *Life-Prolonging Scripture’s Key* is the path of cultivating truth—\nEssence and function both derive from this one scripture.\n\nHymn says:\nWithin the jade pot lies the profoundest mystery;\nTo know it, one must first bind the restless monkey-mind.\nDiligently perfect merit and conduct in full—\nOnly then may sageliness and truth both be complete.\nAt the kalpa’s end, the flying immortal isle remains unharmed;\nBeyond the world, how could it be confined to a Brahma-garden?\nWhen one awakens to the ever-subtle principle,\nAt the ultimate depth of the mysterious, there are no words.\n\nAs the Elder Lord concluded his discourse,\nDragon-phoenixes and celestial immortals came to welcome him,\nReturning to Jade Capital.\nThen the Heavenly Master, having received the wondrous Dharma, declared:\n“I vow to propagate it widely,\nTo transmit it to the virtuous.\nIf any man or woman receives, upholds, reads, or recites it,\nI and the ten precept-enforcing immortal officials shall protect them wherever they may be.”\n\nFor Heaven is impartial,\nAnd urges all toward goodness.\nWhere the Dao is present, blessings arise unseen;\nWhen people are deluded by desire and follow its dictates,\nFortune aligns with destiny.\nIf one attains the mean,\nBlessings come unbidden—\nWhat need to fear calamity’s extremity?\nIf one loses the mean,\nCalamity’s extremity arrives inescapably—\nWhat hope then for blessings?\n\nGood and evil causes are like a turning wheel’s spokes,\nLike an echo following a sound—\nHow can one avoid their retribution?\n\nHave you not seen:\nFragrant blossoms filling the railing cannot escape the frost of the ninth month;\nGold and jade filling the hall cannot avoid the hundred-year limit.\nThe human body is an illusory form—\nHow can it endure forever in the floating world?\nAs transgressions accumulate,\nOne is surely bound to the underworld’s eternal coils.\nHow much better to open the divine radiance,\nShattering the eight gates’ barriers,\nSweeping away the miasmic qi,\nAscending to the Three Realms’ palace!\n\nAlas! Sentient beings, deluded by the manifold leaks,\nTheir natures burdened with manifold faults,\nRush ceaselessly through the surging waves,\nWander lost in the misty clouds, never awakening.\nThe Three Corpses and Six Ghosts rejoice in triumph,\nWhile the Four Great Elements and hundred spirits grieve in sorrow.\nThe cloud-palace and immortal mansion are barred to them;\nThe desolate wilds must be their destined abode.\nTheir primordial truth scattered by the mournful wind,\nTheir spirit-souls adrift on the ghostly path,\nLifelong karmic debts appear before them—\nIn vain they repent, asking: “Where shall we go?”\n\nThus the Most High said:\n“The highest virtue does not act as virtue;\nThe lesser virtue clings to virtue.\nThose who cling are not called virtuous.”\n\nClinging to perverse views,\nWhen one encounters right vision,\nCan repel all demons,\nGrasp the authority of Heaven and Earth,\nCommand the myriad spirits,\nAnd wield the pivot of the Three Realms.\n\nYet the clamor of the dusty world is vast,\nThe delusions and obstructions towering—\nHow can one soar upon the azure clouds,\nOr guide the mortal frame to the azure vault?\nHow can one, amid the five sufferings and eight difficulties,\nReach beyond the three isles and ten continents?\nBut within the square inch of the heart,\nOne may slay demons and banish them beyond the world’s bounds,\nServe loyal ministers in the imperial court,\nNaturally ascending as a transcendent,\nThe Dao in harmony with spontaneity.\nComing and going, unbound and unhindered,\nOne roams freely and at ease.\n\nThis is the Most High’s method of aiding beings and delivering the deluded,\nPervading all directions,\nCirculating through the Three Realms.\nThus he commanded the Heavenly Master to transmit it to all beings,\nThat all may escape suffering and karma,\nTogether enter the truth of the Dao.\nUpholding and receiving it,\nOne penetrates the mysterious and fathoms the wondrous,\nGains unobstructed insight,\nTranscends and enters the Dharma-gate,\nAnd naturally attains the protection of the ten great immortal officials,\nGuarding the body of the cultivator who embraces the One.\n\nHark! With single-minded resolve, smite and sever all demonic spirits,\nTransforming the host of sufferings into the ten spirits of goodness.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe myriad streams branch forth to nurture all beings,\nAs snow and moon gleam bright, rain clears to fair skies.\nA thousand inlets churn with waves, a thousand moons grow dim,\nYet one stream’s waves stilled, a single orb shines clear.\nIn origin, the true state is the same—what difference lies between them?\nOnly delusion turns what is into what is not.\nThen laugh at the falling blossoms, petals drifting,\nWhile wild birds freely indulge their many passions.\n\nThereupon, bowing again to the Venerable Lord, he spoke this eulogy:\n\nWithin the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* commands the descent of true numinosity.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe jade-text’s profound purport is most earnest,\nLest sentient beings fall into the night’s barred gate.\nThus the Supreme Mystery’s wondrous principle is expounded,\nPointing to open the stubborn mind, discerning form as emptiness.\nAuspicious winds bathe the Yellow Blossom Palace,\nThe moon of wisdom illumines the Crimson Realm Pavilion.\nInvoking sacred merit, neither within nor without,\nThe divine luminaries surely descend in direct response.\n\nWithin the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:\nThe household and dwelling secure peace and tranquility.\n\n*Ode:*\nWho can suddenly comprehend and awaken to the true scripture,\nDispelling mundane attachments to guard this form?\n\nCultivating nature to preserve the spirit, refining essence to nourish the blood,\nFirming the root by forsaking desire, harmonizing qi and numinosity.\nThe Mud-Pill Palace set in motion reveals the bright moon,\nThe Sea of Fluids responds by capturing the mirrored stars.\nShould the six senses be subdued, no ills or evils arise,\nNaturally the dwelling aligns and secures peace.\n\nWithin the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:\nParents are preserved in long life.\n\n*Ode:*\nDiligently cultivate the wondrous form, the body luminously complete,\nLet not the square inch of the heart be stained by dust or grime.\nSilently enact the immortal’s deeds,\nCeaselessly advance the workings of the Dao’s merit.\nThe Ten Flowers surely rise, marking the golden standard,\nThe Five Elders must inscribe the jade names.\nAll stems from the body’s observance of precepts and goodness,\nJoyfully extending to nine generations, preserving long repose.\n\nWithin the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:\nAll aversions dissolve into dust.\n\n*Ode:*\nSimply abide in constant stillness and constant purity,\nHeaven and earth attain tranquility, the ten thousand dharmas become clear.\nThe Spirit Valley endures, unfolding jade blossoms,\nThe elixir spoon yields golden crystals.\nThe treasure vase emits auspiciousness, dragons and serpents play,\nThe cauldron of longevity radiates light, startling ghosts and demons.\nShould one seize the sacred merit and refine it ceaselessly,\nNaturally all aversions dissolve into dust.\n\nWithin the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:\nThe myriad evils spontaneously return to rectitude.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe mind-ape bound, entering the mysterious curtain,\nThe wondrous form adorned, from this its majesty arises.\nTurning the Mysterious Pass, sealing the earth’s cavern,\nDriving back the wondrous norm, seizing heaven’s mechanism.\nThe blade of wisdom slays all demons and devils,\nThe Dharma-seal proclaims might, specters grow scarce.\nVast and boundless, the heart filled with wind and moon,\nThe myriad evils bow their heads, returning to submission.\n\nWithin the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:\nOne’s livelihood attains contentment.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe square inch of the heart cultivated, level and smooth,\nWorldly entanglements wholly vanish, not a thread clings.\n\nThe Three Corpses’ schemes are captured by the mysterious principle,\nThe Six Thieves’ devices dissolve, their monstrous ferocity vanishes.\nThe winding Milky Way emerges, its moon bright,\nThe spring hues of the valley open, its winds pure and clear.\nWho would know this as the livelihood of the Way,\nOr willingly cultivate it to attain contentment?\n\nWithin the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:\nThe whole household naturally enjoys health.\n\n*Ode:*\nNo need to rush through distant passes,\nFor those lost beyond the clouds, the Dao is hard to find.\nThe divine radiance illumines only the path of non-action,\nThe Dharma-eye ceases to gaze upon obstructing mountains.\nThe vermilion gates and jade towers are true creation,\nIn the joy of clear wind and bright moon, one roams free.\nIf one grasps the livelihood of the secluded hermitage,\nEven the hermit’s sparse host finds peace.\n\nWithin the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:\nDescendants preserve prosperity and glory.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe empty, numinous terrace, its auspicious mists pure,\nA boundless harmony pervades the vast expanse.\nCloud-capped peaks stand cold in the divine wind,\nSmoke-wreathed cottages gleam under the bright moon.\nThe rustic flute plays an idle, carefree tune,\nThe shepherd boy sings the voice of Great Peace.\nSince recognizing the joy of the mountain dweller,\nThe alchemical maiden and infant flourish in turn.\n\nWithin the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:\nThe five paths naturally open and connect.\n\n*Ode:*\nWith governance and discipline, undertakings prosper,\nLoyal hearts aid the state and assist the wise.\nNever allow slanderers to consume the ruler’s bounty,\nEver permit meritorious deeds to serve as the emperor’s ministers.\nSince the cosmos can enact true transformation,\nThe rivers and mountains should be solemn and clear.\nTogether we behold the august virtue of the sagely lord,\nEvery road unobstructed, celebrating Great Peace.\n\nWithin the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:\nAll evils are forever extinguished.\n\n*Ode:*\nWho would tame the unruly mind-ape and horse,\nTo prevent their reckless flight from ruining the journey ahead?\nFacing peach and plum blossoms in the sunlit day,\nOne gathers life’s livelihood, retiring to the old capital.\nHow fine the mountain’s clarity after the rain,\nYet one frets when clouds darken the moon’s brilliance.\nIf only one could extinguish worldly passions,\nHow could evils ever arise of their own accord?\n\nWithin the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:\nThe six livestock thrive and multiply.\n\n*Ode:*\nRecognizing the alarm in fleeting vanities,\nOne should promptly turn away and abandon mundane attachments.\nThough present matters may seem endlessly trivial,\nWhen the mind is not set in motion, all is naturally pure.\nLivelihood will not lack abundance if not neglected,\nAchievements will surely come if not abandoned.\nWhat other profit could one seek,\nWhen the six livestock prosper and the master flourishes?\n\nWithin the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:\nIllnesses find healing and recovery.\n\n*Ode:*\nLet not a single thought be bound by karmic ties,\nWith all passages harmonized, life is preserved and prolonged.\nDo not allow true qi to be constantly depleted,\nBut let the numinous source be daily replenished.\nDragon and tiger cannot cease their strife,\nKan and Li do not spontaneously unite.\nNo need for herbs to usurp the spirit’s principle—\nDisasters will surely vanish, and joy will reign.\n\nWithin the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:\nWealth and possessions are not wasted.\n\n*Ode:*\nThis mysterious pearl is beyond price,\nYet all beings possess it and cannot retain it.\nIt is like the bright moon mirrored in the river’s waters,\nOr the pure wind stirring the white autumn.\nIt is best to secure it firmly in advance,\nLest it scatter and become a later sorrow.\nThe golden gate and jade door should always be shut,\nTo prevent the wild ape from conceiving thieving thoughts.\n\nWithin the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:\nMisfortunes never arise.\n\n*Ode:*\nTurning the light inward to extinguish the dust-heart,\nDo not fail the mysterious gate’s resounding Dharma-voice.\nCreation and transformation lie before your eyes,\nDo not wander beyond the clouds in vain search.\nThe cold cliff’s moon shines bright, the mountain ape cries,\nThe valley’s trees bloom fragrant, the wild birds sing.\nIf one truly practices this Dao,\nWhat disaster could ever intrude?\n\nWithin the home, the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*:\nEver preserve smoothness, benefit, and integrity.\n\n*Ode:*\nDo not treat the untainted as trivial,\nBut aspire to true emptiness and advance on the wondrous path.\nOften rely on Red Pine for sustenance,\nEver follow the Azure Vault in its waxing and waning.\nParting the dense veil of yin clouds,\nThe radiant bright moon emerges in splendor.\nDispelling the dust’s clamor without a trace,\nJoyfully one ever preserves smoothness, benefit, and integrity.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: Excellent, excellent! You may propagate the true teaching, bringing boundless blessings and benefits to all beings, that they may forever partake in supreme goodness.\n\n*Explanation:*\nThe autumn sky clears at dusk, clouds absent,\nThe moon’s radiance shines bright upon the waterside.\nYet how fierce the raging wind’s sudden fury,\nChurning waves scatter the jade-like orb.\n\nGuard against the monkey-mind’s frivolous antics—tame it within the jade grotto;\nCurb the horse-intent’s stubbornness—tie it beneath the dark mountain.\nBeyond the wilds, spring grasses flourish;\nBefore the peaks, rare fragrances abound.\nYet if horse and monkey remain untethered,\nThey chase the fleeting scene in reckless flight.\nWhen the realm’s illusions arise unprepared,\nAmid the deep willow mist, one’s trace is surely lost.\n\nBy willow ponds and flowered bowers, spring gleams bright,\nLuring mortals to wander and gaze.\nTrusting their steps, they forget the hour’s late return;\nSwiftly the slanting sun passes the riverside tower.\n\nThis floating life is but illusion—how can one bear the days and months as a tally?\nGlory and disgrace are empty splendor—still more, the sigh for time’s flow like water.\nTo endure the creation of transgressions is to let the soul sink in the cold night;\nTo remain unenlightened is to let the spirit fall into shadowed yin.\n\nConsider the golden bell hung high—if the wood is unstruck, the day ends soundless;\nThe precious moon hangs in the void—if clouds do not veil it, the night remains radiant.\nThus, if the mind does not stir, the nature abides in constancy;\nIf the outer does not intrude, the inner remains at peace.\nWith inner peace, the ten thousand dharmas grow clear;\nWith nature’s constancy, the myriad demons submit of themselves.\nWhat darkness is left unilluminated?\nWhat transformation cannot unfold?\n\nAlas! You common folk, dull to your true nature,\nIndulge in passions and desires,\nRevolving endlessly through the six paths—\nWhat virtue, what cultivation have you?\nWillingly you sink beneath the nine springs.\nBy moonlit pavilions and pine streams, no thought of escape from the prison;\nIn the burning house, you but thrust your head deeper—\nEver in the sea of suffering, craving glory and disgrace,\nYou betray your true origin, swept along by the waves.\nEnsnared by the dust’s leaks,\nBound to the cycles of arising and ceasing as pratyeka and śrāvaka,\nChasing scenes, lost in delusion—\nMeasuring causes by birth and death,\nBewildered, unrepentant,\nYou cling to the throng’s passions,\nSinking yourselves in bitter destinies, losing the human form.\nWhen shall you again ascend the Dao’s shore?\n\nBy the Most High’s profound grace, the true canon is once more expounded,\nUniversally saving all beings,\nThat they may forever partake in supreme goodness.\n\nHark!\n\nO Most High’s true and excellent Dharma words,\nUniversally bestowing boundless blessings upon all beings.\n\nIn verse it is proclaimed:\nThe wondrous, all-pervading form is inherently majestic,\nThe vast and mysterious grace knows no partiality.\nAll things partake in the true work of creation,\nAll spirits abide in the profound and hidden mystery.\nDragons and serpents possess treasures—yet these are not rare;\nHeaven and earth show no favor—truly pitiable indeed.\nDiscern the principle of use within the useless,\nSplit open the chaos to reveal the subtle mechanism.\n\nThe Heavenly Master bows in reverence, giving thanks,\nReceiving and upholding the teachings with faith.\n\nAnnotation:\nThe Dao pervades the ten directions,\nIts blessings suffuse all things.\nIt nurtures and transforms all beings,\nUniting all kinds in perfect harmony.\nSubtle as motes of dust,\nVast as heaven and earth,\nIt governs the warp of sun and moon,\nThe weft of yin and yang.\nEmbrace it, and it shines;\nTurn from it, and it dims.\nHidden or manifest, it follows the moment’s need,\nAdapting to each vessel’s measure.\nOnly the wise align with it—\nIt must not be shown to the unworthy.\nTreat it lightly, and it will not be attained;\nRevere it, and it will surely come.\nThus is the Mystery Gate established,\nTo discern the true and expose the false,\nThat all may ascend,\nAnd none drown in the depths.\nWhen merit is perfected and conduct complete,\nThe spirit soars to the immortal’s rank.\nMay all beings encounter the true teaching,\nTake heed, take heed—\nLet there be no duality, no duality.\n\nIn verse it is proclaimed:\nA thousand scriptures, ten thousand treatises shatter delusion—\nWhy wait any longer to turn back?\n\nLet the karmic sea from this day forth be calmed of its waves,\nLet the mountain of transgressions hence be leveled and held steady.\nBefore the mind has reckoned for others,\nFirst remove from the heart all self-serving gain.\nWhen virtue and power are both perfected and merit complete,\nOne walks alone through mist and clouds, delighting in non-action.\n*Tai Shang Xuan Ling Bei Dou Ben Ming Yan Sheng Zhen Jing Zhu Jie*, Volume the Lower, concludes.\n\n#1 The character \"呆\" in \"贪呆\" appears to be an error.\n#2 \"直灵\" is likely a miswriting of \"真灵.\"\n\n**Postface**\n\nI have heard that the vast and august Heaven is most high and most distant—\nNo ladder can reach its heights, no path can enter its midst.\nThe Great Dao is most profound and most mysterious—\nNo reckoning can fathom its origin, no method can plumb its principles.\nThus, goodness is made the path to ascend to Heaven,\nAnd scriptures the gate to enter the Dao.\nGoodness opens the way to the celestial thoroughfare,\nScriptures reveal their hidden mysteries.\nWithout goodness, Heaven has no path;\nWithout scriptures, the Dao has no gate.\nTherefore, scriptures are established to deliver the dead,\nTeachings are bequeathed to open the way to life.\nYet what grace is greater than scripture?\nWhat blessing is greater than goodness?\n\nThe sages bestow scriptures, giving boundless grace;\nOrdinary beings uphold goodness, receiving boundless fortune.\nAll arises from the heart—\nThis is the source of life.\nBut if one merely encounters the mysterious text,\nFlips through its pages without heed or reverence,\nFails to study it deeply or exhaust its meaning,\nHow is this different from one afflicted who seeks a physician,\nYet only recites the prescription without taking the medicine?\nOr one who, upon the law’s enactment,\nUnderstands its statutes but does not guard against wrongdoing?\nReflect upon this—\nHow can mere reading bring deliverance?\n\nAll who encounter this teaching should uphold and revere it,\nThat the icy prisons of the cold hells may melt,\nThe flames of the fiery mountains be quenched.\nThen may one’s name be inscribed in the registers of Penglai and Langyuan,\nThe ledgers of Youfu and Luofeng’s captive souls be stricken,\nAll awakened spirits be delivered,\nAnd together ascend the shore of the Dao.\n\nMy conduct is meager, my nature flawed—\nI am no better than the deaf and mute.\nYet I have presumptuously composed this eulogy,\nMarking the close of this scripture.\n\nA postface by Su Shi of Meishan.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Original Destiny Life-Prolonging Perfected Scripture with Commentary**\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the Supreme Mysterious Numinous Original Destiny Life-Prolonging Perfected Scripture*. Originally attributed to the Perfected One of Mystic Origin of Mount Kongtong, likely composed by a Daoist of the Song or Yuan dynasties. Falsely ascribed prefaces by Li Bai and Su Shi. The commentary centers on the cultivation of mind and nature. Three fascicles. Base text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Wondrous Writings* section, *Jade Instructions* category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the Scripture of Prolonging Life through the Northern Dipper**\n\nOf old, before the Great Simplicity divided, there was neither light nor form. The undifferentiated yellow evolved into transformation, having beginning and end. Thus, the pure ascends while the turbid lingers; goodness is aided while evil is suppressed. A hundred and twenty bureaus were established and arrayed in the netherworld. Thirty-six scriptures were composed and concealed in the Jasper Palace, to deliver those of the Dao among heavenly beings and enlighten the unenlightened among sentient beings. I sigh and say: Is this not the guiding principle of the Three Realms and Ten Directions, the order of Heaven, Earth, and humanity?\n\nNow, in this sagely age, we are blessed with abundant years and have encountered the imperial dynasty, which governs the realm with virtue and pacifies the household, achieving illustrious merit and nurturing the common people. Moreover, the world is at peace, and the Supreme Mystery shines forth. Thus, those of Daoist aspiration—such as the disciples of the Feng clan—renew their vows daily, longing for the truth through the years. They pray to Heaven for protection against malevolent forces and seek the teachings of masters to transmit the essentials of the Dao. Thereupon, they encountered the Perfected One of Mystic Origin of Mount Kongtong, who elucidated the mysterious texts of the Dragon Han era and expounded the wondrous subtleties of the Red Brightness. He taught the talismans of the Ten Caves and the Three Vehicles, transforming the myriad mechanisms into a single principle. He composed a commentary on *The Scripture of Prolonging Life through the Northern Dipper*, which, in its highest aspect, enables the spirit to ascend to the Golden Gates; in its middle aspect, protects the state and secures the household; and in its lower aspect, prolongs life and extends longevity. It universally delivers all sentient beings, guiding them together through the barrierless gate. Therefore, I respectfully compose this text to preface the scripture.\n\n*Respectfully composed by Li Bai.*\n\n---\n\n**Commentary and Verses on the Supreme Mysterious Numinous Original Destiny Life-Prolonging Perfected Scripture, Fascicle One**\n*By the Perfected One of Mystic Origin of Mount Kongtong*\n\n\"Supreme\" (*Tai*) signifies the ultimate; \"High\" (*Shang*) signifies loftiness. \"Mysterious\" (*Xuan*) signifies profound remoteness; \"Numinous\" (*Ling*) signifies divine efficacy. The \"Northern Dipper\" (*Beidou*) is the pivotal mechanism of celestial movement. \"Original Destiny\" (*Benming*) is the inherent nature from the origin. \"Prolonging Life\" (*Yansheng*) is enduring existence without decay. \"Perfected Scripture\" (*Zhenjing*) is the path leading to the attainment of true subtlety.\n\n○ The great assembly of sagely and perfected heavenly beings imparts teachings to guide and transform the world. Whether one’s fate is prosperous or adverse, the ultimate goal is non-action. Internally, one harmonizes the central equilibrium; externally, one aligns with the pivotal mechanism. Through transformation, one ascends in flight to wander and feast in the Jade Capital. Yet how is it that worldly people remain deluded by the true Dao, indulging in greed, wrath, and ignorance, giving rise to the three karmic actions and stirring the six sensory faculties?\n\nThe \"three karmic actions\" are greed, wrath, and ignorance. The \"six sensory faculties\" are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. Once the three karmic actions arise, the six faculties generate obstructions. With obstructions, afflictions arise. With afflictions, myriad entanglements ensue, turning one away from the true purpose. The mind-horse runs wild, the heart-ape dashes in frenzy, scattering and losing the numinous source, corrupting and destroying the true *qi*. Sins accumulate like mountains, while good deeds are as fleeting as dust or dew. The Southern Asterism shortens one’s allotted lifespan, the Northern Dipper erases one’s years.

      "translated_text": "Fleeting worldly ties bring no true joy,\nYet the primal homeland’s scenes are most wondrous.\nA few wisps of dawn mist drift across distant ridges,\nA sliver of slanting moon illumines the cold pond.\n\nTo know the principle of extending life in one’s original destiny,\nAwaken to the mystery of the primal creative mechanism.\n\nAt that time, the Most High Lord Lao, in the first year of *Yongshou*, on the seventh day of the first month, was in the Supreme Ultimate Palace within the Great Clarity Realm.\nThat time—this very moment.\nThe Most High Lord Lao—ancestor of Heaven and Earth, origin of the myriad dharmas, whose sacred virtue towers beyond measure.\nThe first year of *Yongshou*, the seventh day of the first month—within the boundless void, where kalpas endure without end, cycles defy numbering, yet we force them into calendric names.\nIn the Great Clarity Realm, within the Supreme Ultimate Palace—realm of carefree wandering, land of spontaneous freedom, where jade halls rise in majesty, towers of jasper soar in splendor, gold and jade gleam resplendent, and radiant clouds stream with light.\n\nThus did the Most High Lord Lao dwell in his abode, attended by the myriad spirits. Yet worldly beings know only that the Most High Lord Lao resides above the azure vault, unaware that he abides within the human body itself. Hence it is said: the Three Clarities are within oneself—why seek them without?\n\n**Verse:**\nThe Great Dao’s subtlety defies all probing,\nYet within it lies the profound mystery of wondrous workings.\nWhy search beyond the clouds for true awakening?\nSeek but the ancestral wind within your own body.\nRecognize the path from which you came of old,\nAnd let flowers and trees grow as they will.\nTo cultivate without grasping this principle\nIs like scooping water to summon the toad—utterly in vain.\n\nBeholding sentient beings adrift for kalpas unending,\nTrapped in the cycles of birth and death:\nAll beings are originally of one work with Heaven and Earth,\nOf one substance with sages and worthies.\nAwakened, they become sages;\nDeluded, they are but ordinary mortals.\n\n**O assembly!** Those who awaken awaken to the wondrous function of the true and constant,\nSeizing the transformations of Heaven and Earth.\nThey preserve their true nature and nurture their essence,\nRefine their souls and clarify their spirits,\nEmpty their minds that intent may be at peace,\nCut off their desires that their spirits may be clear.\nUnattached to the myriad things in their single mind,\nTheir flawless practice reaches completion, their work is done.\nThey abide in effortless spontaneity,\nCarefree beyond the realm of things.\n\nThe deluded are deluded in their true awakened nature.\nRelying on the harmonious *qi* of their parents’ union,\nEntrusted to the generative essence of yin and yang,\nThey enter the womb as a borrowed form.\nWhen their *qi* is full and their form complete,\nAfter ten months, they are born as human beings.\nThen, receiving the four elements and five aggregates,\nTheir illusory, impermanent bodies take shape.\nScarcely do they discern east from west,\nGradually distinguishing south from north,\nWhen their eyes already behold perverse sights,\nTheir ears hear perverse sounds,\nTheir tongues savor perverse flavors,\nTheir noses smell perverse fragrances.\nTheir minds crave and cling to desires,\nTheir hearts arise in love and aversion.\nIn action, they spawn right and wrong;\nIn movement, they generate crookedness and obscurity.\nPlanting the roots of all evils,\nThey receive retribution in the three evil destinies,\nAdrift for kalpas unending,\nTrapped in the wheel of birth and death.\n\nThus did the Most High Lord Lao manifest his great divine power,\nHis eyes radiating the light of great spiritual penetration.\nBeholding sentient beings drifting in the cycle of birth and death without end,\nHe was moved by compassion and broadly bestowed the true teachings,\nMaking them the boat and oar to ferry the world,\nThat beings might awaken to the formless form,\nRecognize the formless form,\nAnd thereby attain long life and spontaneous freedom,\nForever ceasing their wanderings in the wheel of rebirth.\n\n**Verse:**\nOur original countenance—how could it be lost?\nOnly through greed and delusion do we enter dreams again and again.\nFortunate that the celestial realm contains chaos,\nYet how can we bear to let the mind-ground sprout dust and defilement?\nWithin being and non-being, seek the illusory and false;\nAmidst emptiness and form, find the true and real.\nReturn to the homeland where the scenery is fine—\nWildflowers, singing birds, and willows in spring.\n\nSome dwell in the human realm,\nSome in the Middle Kingdom,\nSome among the barbarian tribes,\nSome within savage lands.\nSome are rich, some noble,\nSome lowly, some poor.\nFor a time, by karmic conditions,\nThey fall into hell.\n\nFor sentient beings, according to their karmic deeds,\nReceive rebirth in accord with their fruits:\nSome are born in the Middle Kingdom,\nSome among barbarians,\nSome in the households of the wealthy and noble,\nSome in the homes of the poor and lowly.\nHaving briefly attained human form,\nMany follow their desires,\nUnaware and unknowing,\nIndulging their passions and committing transgressions,\nRecklessly acting wrongly.\nThe Three Corpses fully orchestrate their downfall,\nThe Six Bandits freely incite their cunning.\n**O assembly!** Greedy for wealth and lustful for beauty,\nTheir words belie their hearts.\nJealous of the capable, they ruin the worthy;\nThey deceive Heaven and Earth.\nDisloyal and unfilial,\nDishonest and untrustworthy,\nThey harm the good and virtuous,\nOppress the kind and gentle.\nViolating Heaven and Earth’s prohibitions,\nDefying the statutes of true sages,\nThey plunder nests and break eggs,\nSlaying and harming sentient beings.\nCommitting all manner of sins and transgressions,\nThey never reflect upon themselves.\nThe thirty-six thousand spirits within their bodies\nTransform into eighty-four thousand dust-like afflictions and karmic deeds.\nThe fire of calamity burns their bodies, leaving no escape.\nThe four elements and five aggregates scatter with earth, water, fire, and wind,\nLeaving only their lonely, wandering souls—\nFor in their days of fleeting karmic conditions,\nClinging and deluded, they failed to awaken,\nFalling into the Avīci Hell.\nHow could they not know sorrow?\n\nYet humans possess a dignified six-foot frame,\nWashing and adorning it,\nDressing in fine silks and splendid attire,\nCherishing their bodies.\nWho among them is willing to preserve their true nature, nurture their lives,\nRefine their essence, and store their spirits?\nThus does the Heavenly Worthy bestow his scriptures and dharmas,\nGuiding sentient beings,\nSwiftly enabling them to suddenly comprehend,\nAnd awaken to the wondrous mystery of non-action.\n\n**Verse:**\nIn the celestial realm, spring days are longest,\nRain-cleared skies, warm mist, and radiant winds.",

      "translated_text": "As for Shu Capital—if we speak in worldly terms, it was once the dwelling place of emperors, the ancestral root of mountains and rivers, the guiding principle of the cosmos, revolving through the world, transforming like fish and dragons; such was it when it served as the imperial seat.\n\nIf we speak in Daoist terms, Shu Capital is none other than the body and heart. Thus the *Nine Elders’ Treatise on Gathering the Real* says:\n*\"The wind and moon of Great Peace grace the imperial capital,\nAll nations come to pay homage to the Sage’s grace.\"*\n\nThe heart is likened to the emperor, the body to Shu Capital. When the heart is upright, the hundred bones rejoice, the myriad spirits harmonize and flourish. When the heart is perverse, the Three Corpses seize life, the Six Thieves deceive the public, calamity befalls the body, and one drifts endlessly through the wheel of rebirth.\n\nThe earth spirits surging forth represent the arising of intention from the mind-ground. The single jade platform is the precious throne of the celestial perfected. If one can arouse the heart and establish intention, refrain from perverse views, and avoid planting the seeds of transgression, then by seeking the gate of the great Dao and suddenly awakening to the nature of non-action, one will not be deluded by the faults of the six desires, attain the rank of the Ten Flowers, wander freely beyond the mundane, and merge with the Real.\n\nA verse says:\nDo not block the azure heavens’ path, nor deem it impassable;\nThis illusory body—know it turns to emptiness in an instant.\nCease idle talk of grasping profound principles,\nFor without true sincerity, all efforts are in vain.\nStrike boldly open the gate of life and death,\nLet the hero leap free from the dragon of bondage.\nWandering beyond the mundane as a guest of non-action,\nSun and moon are seized and held within your grasp.\n\nThereupon, the Lord Lao ascended the Jade Platform to sit, bestowing upon the Heavenly Master the *Northern Dipper Life-Span Scripture and Oral Instructions*, broadly proclaiming essential methods to universally deliver sentient beings.\n\nAt that time, the Most High Lord Lao ascended the Jade Platform and expounded the teachings of the Three Vehicles, revealing the wondrous principles of the Northern Dipper’s life-prolonging essence. He bestowed these upon the Heavenly Master to transform and enlighten all beings, that all might awaken to the Dao.\n\nO assembly! Sentient beings indulge their seven emotions, incurring transgressions and thus hells; they covet the five desires, lacking wondrous fruits and thus no heavens. Unaware, they wallow in the Three Poisons and Ten Evils, drowning in the river of love, drifting through the cycle of birth and death.\n\nTherefore, the Most High expounded this true scripture to guide the world, that people might not generate perverse views. In the intervals between dawn and dusk, regardless of others’ faults, one should constantly examine one’s own errors, temper sharp words with restraint, and repent accordingly. Using the Dharma-water to wash away worldly toil, polishing the precious mirror to illuminate this self, one purifies body and heart, embodying the function of the Dao. The primordial spirit dwells in the cinnabar palace, the light of wisdom shines upon the Jade Mountain. The Four Great Elements are at peace, the hundred bones naturally ordered. Within and without, emptiness and clarity; above and below, stillness and illumination. Yin and yang unite in intercourse, their movement endless. Merging into a single qi, refining the great elixir, one transforms, ascends in flight—profound beyond all reckoning.\n\nWhen the ordinary form thus embodies the function of the Dao,\nEven sacred works need not be feared as unattainable.\n\nA verse says:",

      "translated_text": "When the elixir-body is refined, it becomes naturally so,\nBeyond the round and penetrating, one glimpses the paradise within the pot.\nFame and profit are but affairs of others’ households,\nVirtue and power are all for my own karmic conditions.\n\nWhen the wind stills and rain clears, waves ripple emerald,\nWhen mist disperses and clouds scatter, the moon’s radiance is fair.\nIn stillness, one beholds the adorned realm,\nEach thing, each head—profound, ever more profound.\n\nAt this time, the Elder Lord addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: “The human body is hard to obtain, birth in the Middle Land is hard to attain. Even if one attains birth, the true Dharma is hard to encounter. Reflecting upon the cycles of birth and death, within the wombs of womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born, and transformation-born beings—whether in deep mountains or desolate wilds, whether dwelling among grasses and trees or in rivers and streams—pigs, dogs, oxen, horses, donkeys, mules, and other beasts of burden; venomous insects and fierce beasts, tigers, leopards, jackals, and wolves; shrimp, crabs, fish, turtles, and all aquatic creatures; birds, beasts, and flying fowl; the myriad forms of the six livestock and all feathered kinds; every sort of secondary-born being—boundless and immeasurable, how can their numbers be known? Compared to such creatures, humans are as one in ten thousand.\n\nAlas! The multitude squanders and ruins what is not theirs. Even if one attains a human body, to be born among the barbarians beyond civilization is still a transgression. Dwelling in such lands, have you ever heard of the country called Boye beyond the Northern Sea? In that land, people dwell in mountains in summer and hide in caves in winter. Desolate grasses stretch endlessly, yellow winds sweep the earth, and they clothe themselves in leaves and fur. Hunger is sated with birds and insects, neither benevolence nor righteousness is known, nor is there any understanding of virtue and power. They indulge their desires, commit wrongs, and transgress, making it difficult to ascend the immortal’s ranks and easy to sink into the ghostly realms.\n\nNow that you dwell in a land where the Three Teachings flow and the Five Constants govern, born as humans in the Middle Land—is this not the result of accumulated virtue? Yet even among those born in the Middle Land, many cling to perverse views, fail to encounter the true Dharma, boast of their own cleverness, vaunt their superiority, falsely claim mastery of the mysterious gate, and misinterpret the scriptures and laws. Thus deluded, they cannot perceive the Dao.\n\nFailing to recognize the true principles of the Three Teachings,\nOne comes to this dusty world in vain.\n\nA verse says:\nThe cycles of the Six Paths—alas, how lamentable!\nYet within the square inch of the heart, apply your effort.\nWhen the playful monkey is let loose, a thousand things arise,\nBut when the inferior horse is tamed, not half remains.\nThe mundane scene blends like the autumn night’s moon,\nRoot and dust are entrusted to the jade-green pot.\nThe homeland is but a footstep away, the scenery fair—\nWith a sweep of the sleeve, laugh and stride the level path.\n\nMany are deluded by the true Dao, many enter perverse sects,\nMany plant the roots of sin, many practice cunning deceit,\nMany indulge in lust and killing, many favor worldly attachments,\nMany give rein to greed and wrath, many sink into hell,\nMany lose the human form.\n\nSuch are the conditions of sentient beings who do not awaken, who know not the true Dao, and whose delusions are many. For their good roots are shallow, their wisdom dim and turbid. They refuse loyalty to their lord, filial piety to their parents; the poor do not keep to their station, the rich do not bestow their grace. They seek no good, aid not the distressed, scorn the Three Luminaries, and waste the Five Grains. They plunge into the bitter sea of craving for wealth and lust, toiling endlessly in the cage of strife for fame and gain. They disbelieve in karma, hoard with stinginess, seethe with envy, slaughter creatures, feast on dogs and swine, sever lives to clog their own flesh with pus. Relying on power and might, they bully the lowly, devour flesh and blood, spew filthy words, gossip and slander, stir dualistic views. When they encounter fasts and offerings, they harbor destructive thoughts; when they see true cultivators, they foster disbelief. Countless are their delusions, their wisdom obscured. Many sink into hell, many lose the human form, failing to see the true Dao and entering only perverse sects.\n\nAlas, how may the multitude perceive the true Dao?\nDo not cling to sound, scent, taste, touch, or dharmas;\nDo not give rise to stinginess, greed, killing, theft, or lust.\nAwaken great wisdom, purify body and heart,\nInwardly observe the six roots, the Four Great Elements, the five viscera, and the hundred spirits.\nBy what do these forms move? By what do they speak?\nWhen a single breath does not come, the Four Great Elements suddenly cease.\n\nA verse says:\nWithin the body, the subtle and mysterious lie clearly revealed—\nDo not give rise to stinginess or greed, nor be deluded by phenomena.\nWhen the great Dao is awakened, true joy arises,\nBut when worldly affairs are discerned, only sorrow remains.\nDo not indulge in turbidity and wallow in evils,\nBut purify the heart and transform the Five Decays.\nWhen spirit and nature are free of dust and defilement,\nHeaven and earth expand to reveal the numinous foundation.\n\nNow, moved by pity for these sentient beings,\nI set forth the teachings and expound the good conditions,\nThat they may know the Dao, know the nature and life of the body,\nAll of which depend on the Dao for their arising.\n\nMoreover, the sages established the teachings in myriad ways,\nAdapting their methods to the capacities of beings,\nSetting forth laws to deliver them,\nThat all sentient beings might awaken to the great Dao\nAnd know that heaven, earth, and the myriad things all depend on the Dao for their arising.\n\nFor the great Dao arises from non-being into being,\nAnd from non-nothingness into nothingness—\nTruly, it is hard to speak of!\n\nWhen heaven and earth were formless,\nAt the time when the clear and turbid had not yet separated,\nVast and obscure, dim and silent,\nIt could not be heard, nor could it be seen.\nIn the midst of the indistinct and vague,\nThe Five Ultimates arose.\nWhen the kalpas of the Five Ultimates ended,\nA single qi congealed, transforming into chaos.\nAfter ninety thousand kalpas,\nGradually, the mysterious and the yellow emerged.\nThen, the Primordial Sovereign nurtured essence and cultivated qi to perfection,\nBursting open the chaos.\nThe two qi subtly divided,\nThe Three Powers began to take form.\nThe clear qi congealed and floated upward to become heaven,\nThe turbid qi settled and sank downward to become earth.\nThe sun, moon, stars, and constellations were arrayed,\nMountains, rivers, seas, and peaks were established.\nCold and heat shifted, yin and yang ascended and descended,\nAnd the myriad things were born—\nNone apart from the great Dao.\n\nThus the *Scripture of Purity* says:\n“The great Dao has no name, yet it gives birth to heaven and earth;\nThe great Dao has no form, yet it nurtures the myriad things.”",

Within and without, emptiness and clarity; above and below, stillness and illumination. Yin and yang unite in intercourse, their movement endless. Merging into a single qi, refining the great elixir, one transforms, ascends in flight—profound beyond all reckoning.\n\nWhen the ordinary form thus embodies the function of the Dao,\nEven sacred works need not be feared as unattainable.\n\nA verse says:",

      "translated_text": "How does one invoke the original spirit of one’s destiny?\nSimply turn inward to the original heart, observe the fast, reform faults, and cultivate goodness—this is the way.\nFasting and offering rites: fasting is to discipline the heart, while offering is to express sincerity. By purifying body and mind, one may repent of past wrongs and thereby attain blessings.\nThus the saying: *\"The sickness of the self must be cured by the self.\"*\n\nWhat is the original spirit within the body?\nJust as heaven has the Northern Dipper, so too does the human body; just as heaven has the Three Officials and Five Emperors, so too does the human form possess its counterparts—nine palaces and four bureaus, all mirrored within.\nThe Northern Dipper within the body is the heart. The Dipper governs the turning of the four seasons and the revolutions of the celestial bodies, just as the heart governs the transformations of the myriad things and commands the hundred spirits. Thus, the Northern Dipper is the heart.\nThe Three Officials are the three *hun*-souls; the Five Emperors are the spirits of the five viscera. The nine palaces are the nine orifices; the four bureaus are the four limbs.\nIf one can nurture the three *hun*, harmonize the five viscera, subdue the nine orifices, and protect the four limbs from worldly defilement, cutting off mundane attachments, awakening to the subtle and profound, attaining clarity and emptiness, and perceiving without obstruction—then one may soar beyond the material realm. At such a stage, to pray for blessings and grace is indeed wondrous.\nThus, the sages established these external practices to guide the inner illumination of non-action.\nAh! Do you grasp this subtle truth? Once revealed, the ten thousand phenomena of the azure heavens become still.\n\n*A verse says:*\nTurn the heart back, reflect, and sever worldly ties;\nAwakening, one sees the natural state as it is.\nThe three realms are but fleeting flowers in the world’s dream,\nWhile the cinnamon of the Nine Heavens veils the profound mystery.\nThe heart of Dao is like the moon upon the waves,\nThe nature of Dharma blooms like a lotus in fire.\nWhen kalpas end and all is seen as void,\nThe green mountains stand tall against the distant sky.\n\nWith utmost reverence, present offerings—various incense and flowers, seasonal fresh fruits—following the rituals of the age. Purify the altar space, modeling heaven and earth.\nWhether in a temple or at home, perform the rites according to your capacity. The merit accrued is profound and beyond full description.\nRecite the names of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords, and your transgressions will dissolve, misfortunes be washed away, blessings and longevity sustain your destiny, and virtuous fruits manifest in your being.\n\nIce and charcoal cannot share the same furnace, nor can the wise and foolish dwell together. Ice and charcoal remain apart because their natures differ; the wise and foolish do not coexist because their perceptions diverge. Ice does not know it freezes, nor charcoal that it burns. The wise need not speak to be clear in wisdom; the foolish need not speak to be clouded in ignorance. The wise ever uphold righteousness and propriety, ever fearful of harming others; the foolish persist in cruelty, ever resentful of self-inflicted harm. Alas for the foolish!\nThus the *Book of Documents* states: *\"The virtuous do good, ever finding the day too short; the wicked do evil, ever finding the day too short.\"*\n\nWorldly beings, deluded and ignorant, fail to recognize their myriad transgressions. Yet the celestial officials record every good and evil deed without the slightest error. Know this: fulfill three thousand virtuous acts, and you may ascend as an immortal; accumulate eight hundred transgressions, and your life will be cut short. Then, in Fengdu, you shall endure bitterness alone, and your descendants will surely face hardship.\nAlas! The Most High laments the emptiness of the Ten Continents and Three Isles, the ceaseless wandering of the six paths and four births. Thus, through this scripture, the law of cause and effect is expounded, and retribution is decreed—guiding the wise toward goodness and warning the foolish against evil.\nBy adapting teachings to the capacities of the deluded, the Most High established these precepts and prohibitions. For those with confused minds seeking repentance, let them purify the altar, solemnize the ritual space, arrange incense and flowers, present seasonal fruits, perform the rites, and contribute according to their means. The merit thus accrued is vast and beyond description.\n\nKnow that the Great Dao arises from emptiness, and the original nature exists within non-existence. Who can truly describe it?\nThus the *Scripture on Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao* states:\n*\"Vast and obscure, the pure and tranquil Dao,\nDim and silent, the trace of the Great Void.\nIts essence is serene, dwelling nowhere,\nForm and mind both stilled in the One True Source.\"*\n\nThus, without the false, the true cannot be revealed; without illusion, how can reality be discerned? This wondrous Dharma is expounded to enlighten beings, that they may understand the causes of good and evil. Do not indulge in wrongdoing; do not yield to unchecked desires. Only then may one gradually enter the wondrous gate, awaken to the function of the Dao, and perceive the subtle mysteries beyond the material world—all within the square inch of the heart.\n\nAh!\nHad you but recognized the original face,\nYou would have untied the knot of true emptiness long ago.",

      "translated_text": "How much better to awaken to the affairs of mist and moon,\nPreserving the true *qi* to strengthen one’s youthful years.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Tigers and Wolves.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe wondrous Dao of the Mysterious Origin is most subtle,\nYet when simplicity scatters into emptiness, who can know?\nThrough kalpas, it has never known birth or extinction,\nReturning to the Yellow—is this awakening or delusion?\nFortunate is the autumn sky’s moon without clouds,\nYet the winding shore’s tranquility fears the taint of mud.\nTo subdue tigers and seize dragons is the very point—\nYet this must truly rest in the man himself.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Insects and Snakes.\n\n**Verse:**\nLet not the primal awareness be replaced or renewed,\nFor when the nature is settled, all dusts naturally cease.\nMonkey and horse find rest in the misty peaks’ slumber,\nWhile insects and snakes, though startled by swift thunder, are freed.\nIn the spring-fragrant valley, orioles sing in the sun,\nBy the secluded creek’s bend, swallows sport in the clear sky.\nFacing the scene, one bears it with one’s own strength—\nThe wind and moon of ten thousand mountains grow ever clearer.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Bandits and Disasters.\n\n**Verse:**\nWho can foresee and restrain peril and danger?\nOnly by unveiling the profound beyond the clouds is it attained.\nBefore earth and before heaven, the true principle is known,\nFrom the kalpa’s dawn to its dissolution, no fixed term is set.\nIlluminating inner and outer, the round and harmonious work,\nAwakening and illuminating the mechanisms of immortals and mortals.\nWith a single battle, demonic forces suddenly vanish,\nThe traces of plundering bandits fade into nothingness.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Cangues and Cudgels.\n\n**Verse:**\nBind the stubborn heart to prevent disorder,\nAnd the three thousand penal laws lose their power.\nSuddenly, the golden cangue of wondrous awakening falls away,\nThe great jade fetters of the mysterious wind are shattered.\nAt dawn’s shore, the cave’s brightness reveals hidden immortals,\nBy the cold pool, the moon’s radiance lingers in clarity.\nTeach you to grasp the high principle of heaven—\nSuffering and joy originally lie only in this.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Unnatural Death.\n\n**Verse:**\nTrue awakening, round and harmonious, preserves the undifferentiated,\nThe mysterious flower above and below expands in clarity.\nThe jewel’s light, though eternal, why is it dim?\nThe jade grotto, though opened a thousand times, reveals the Dao’s brightness.\nIf the six senses indulge in delusion without awakening,\nPassions open the leaks—death and rebirth recur.\nTo seek the path that transcends the wheel of rebirth,\nGuard the spirit’s luminosity within, never taking it lightly.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Curses and Oaths.\n\n**Verse:**\nEntangled in the floating life’s net, without refinement,\nSuffering delusion in illusory transformations, indulging in greed.\nThe carefree original form is imprisoned by dust,\nThe unobstructed true spirit is nearly entombed.\nWhen vexation drives one to vow and seek the Dao,\nOnce the affair fades, does the Dao-heart also cease?\nHurrying and bustling, turning the wheel of rebirth,\nAsk yourself: when will you reach the end?\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Heavenly Nets.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe true principle of non-action leaves no trace,\nYet all is the heart’s delusion—paths remain blocked.\nFrom ancient times, only due to craving worldly desires,\nTo this day, it entangles and obscures the mysterious void.\nThe oriole’s song—how can it understand the willow’s green?\nThe butterfly’s dance—how can it know the flower’s red?\nHeaven’s killing and heaven’s giving—matters of grace and harm—\nBetter to seek the profound and break through the darkness.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Earthly Nets.\n\n**Verse:**\nKnow that worldly desires bring many harms to the body,\nBetter to leap with lofty resolve beyond the nets.\nGreed and indulgence leave little level ground,\nWhile ignorance and stinginess, unrestrained, turn to demons.\nTo escape the deep pit requires strenuous effort,\nBefore the trench is dug, do not falter for a moment.\nClouds and water, mist and waves, stretch boundlessly—\nA small boat lightly drifts across the river of delusion.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Blades and Warfare.\n\n**Verse:**\nHow many kinds of blades and warfare exist in the world?\nAmid the thickets of right and wrong, they recklessly contend.\nSlanderous words are sharp as blades,\nYet a heart that embraces tolerance finds ease.\nWith a single thought, reform and pray to transcend the kalpa,\nCalmly, even lamplight seems cold.\nIn the heavens, the Jade Pivot’s Lord presides—\nTurning and sustaining, all is not difficult.\n\n**The Great Sage Northern Dipper Seven Primal Lords**\nCan resolve the Calamities of Water and Fire.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe sea of desire surges boundlessly, touching the sky,\nThe blazing fire of karma burns the plains.\nYet in emptiness, clarity, and stillness, waves are stilled,\nIn gentleness, forbearance, and serenity, smoke does not rise.\nForms and appearances both empty, the heart is naturally calm,\nUnstained by right and wrong, one follows conditions.\nWater ascends, fire descends—this is the true Dao,\nA high bridge spans the ford, ferrying the great river.\n\nThus, the Seven Primal Lords, the Great Sages, are profoundly efficacious.\nThey deliver from all calamities and hardships,\nLifting suffering beings beyond distress.\nIf one urgently invokes them, reciting for protection,\nAll may rely on the generation of a hundred blessings,\nHarmonizing with the Five Phases.\nThe three *hun* souls are secure and healthy,\nEvil spirits cannot linger.\nTrue *qi* descends from the five directions,\nMyriad blessings naturally gather.\nLongevity transcends the Eight Difficulties,\nAll through revering the Seven Stars.\nLife after life, the body is at ease,\nExistence after existence, the spirit remains pure.\nGoodness is like a shadow in light,\nResponse is like an echo in a valley.\nThe Three Primal Spirits together guard,\nThe myriad sages share the same clarity.\nWithout disaster or obstruction,\nEternally preserving the tranquility of the Dao-heart.\n\n**Verse:**\nSubduing demonic forces, the heart is naturally tranquil,\nThe Seven Primal Lords, the Great Sages, are profoundly efficacious.\nEver let the nature be like the moon without clouds,\nNever let the emotions be like duckweed on waves.\nExternally, wash the troubled breast to remove stains,\nInternally, polish the mysterious mirror to break through darkness.\nNaturally, the Eight Difficulties and Three Disasters vanish,\nAll through revering the Seven Stars.\n\n*Here ends the first scroll of the Commentary on the Wondrous True Scripture of the Northern Dipper’s Original Destiny for Extending Life.*",

immortal’s path be overgrown with brambles and thorns.\nThe limpid lake’s clouds disperse—heaven’s edge lies far,\nThe verdant valley’s toad ascends—the sea’s corner soars high.\nAlone before the cold river’s boundless scenes,\nAll are embraced by the cloud-clinging patchwork robe.\n\nThus the soul and spirit are struck,\nMisfortunes coil and cling.\nSome suffer grave illness unhealed,\nOthers fall prey to demonic harm,\nYear upon year mired in distress,\nAge after age beset by misfortune,\nEntangled in lawsuits and summons,\nEven the departed are drawn into suffering.\n\nNow Heaven aids the good and punishes the unkind,\nThus it metes out retribution of fortune and calamity.\nPeople fear misfortune and welcome fortune,\nSo they should cultivate kindness and goodness as their cause.\nThus Heaven urges goodness with the promise of fortune,\nAnd people, desiring fortune, should guard against wrongdoing.\nYet the common masses, unaware of Heaven’s principle,\nMerely crave fortune without practicing goodness,\nVainly fear misfortune without shunning wrongdoing.\nFor such as these, to hope for peaceful dwelling and fortune\nIs something that has never been.\n\nThose who dwell in peace and enjoy fortune\nAre those who have once practiced kindness, established goodness,\nBeen cautious of transgressions, and guarded against wrongdoing.\nThus it is that fortune and misfortune arise from causes,\nGood and evil reap their due retribution.\nThose who deceive none and harm no other thrive long,\nOnly those who temper their nature and restrain themselves know lasting joy.\nThe clear record lies plain before your eyes,\nYet how can the obstinate heart not decide?\n\nFor example, in this world:\nDiligence brings wealth,\nFrugality brings abundance.\nWithout diligence and frugality,\nHow can one attain sufficiency?\nDesiring fortune, one should accumulate goodness,\nFearing misfortune, one should guard against wrongdoing.\nWithout accumulating goodness and guarding against wrongdoing,\nHow can one dwell in peace?\n\nYet the common masses of sentient beings\nDo not reflect on the retribution of good and evil,\nNor the clarity of rewards and judgments.\nInstead, they harbor jealousy, stinginess, and greed,\nLose their true nature and forsake the Way,\nFocusing only on the present,\nDeceiving their conscience for momentary gain,\nNever considering that myriad calamities will one day descend upon them.\nThus their souls are bound,\nMisfortunes coil and cling,\nIllness remains unhealed as malevolent qi invades,\nFortune does not flow as misfortunes arise,\nIn life, vexation;\nIn death, turmoil.\nHow much better to extinguish the karma of the mind and eliminate the karma of the body,\nTo awaken to the emptiness of form and perceive the emptiness of nature.\n\nThe Ode says:\nOriginally nothing bore a name,\nBut for greed and delusion, changes come unceasing.\nChasing pleasure, unaware it is the root of suffering,\nClinging to life, how can one believe it is the cause of transgression?\nFirst, you must unlock the lock upon your heart,\nWash away the dust upon your nature from times past.\nBest to tread with care upon the icy abyss—\nOnce lost, what day will you emerge from the depths?\n\nShould Heaven’s reproach descend,\nOr ghosts below lodge false accusations,\nWhen such peril and distress arise,\nHow can one seek deliverance?\nHasten to petition the Northern Dipper,\nOffer rites of thanks to the Perfected Lords,\nAnd recite the true scriptures,\nAcknowledge the Perfected Lord of your original destiny,\nOnly then will you attain peace and prosperity,\nAnd even deeper mysteries—\nYet these cannot be fully described.\n\nI humbly observe:\nThe Way of Heaven is impartial,\nIt befriends only the good.\nFortune and misfortune have their retribution,\nWhat they respond to lies in the heart.\nThus those who do good find fortune drawing near,\nThose who do evil find misfortune not far off.\nThe Nine Pure Great Canopy and the Three Wretched Hells\nBoth arise from the one heart, manifesting as two matters.\nThus know that the Way of Heaven does not fail sentient beings,\nRather, sentient beings violate the Way of Heaven.\nTherefore, fortune and misfortune follow like shadow and form,\nTrue retribution turns like a wheel in ceaseless revolution.\n\nO assembly, do you not see how clearly rewards and punishments are meted out?\nWhy then remain utterly deluded and unaware?\nOnly deceiving your conscience for fleeting gain,\nEver seeking your own glory,\nHarboring resentment and enmity,\nEver envying the joy of others.\nHow can you believe that to seek your own fortune,\nYou must first bring fortune to others?\nHarming others to benefit yourself\nOnly harms yourself in the dark.\nIf you doubt this, ask yourself but one question:\nCan deceit and luck outwit Heaven?\n\nWhen sins overflow and transgressions mount,\nProvoking Heaven’s wrath above\nAnd the deceit of ghosts below,\nIn that moment of agony,\nWhat use is regret?\n\nAlas, when such peril and distress arise,\nHow can one seek deliverance?\nOnly by swiftly reflecting on your deeds and turning back,\nCurbing greed and wrath to arouse a mind of expedient means,\nFilling the pits and leveling the trenches to foster a mind of equanimity,\nPerforming purification rites to repent transgressions,\nConcentrating your thoughts to invoke the Perfected,\nAcknowledging the Perfected Lord of your original destiny—\nOnly then will you attain peace and prosperity.\n\nHow can one behold the Perfected Lord of one’s original destiny?\nHark!\nDo not let the hordes of demons steal the mirror of your heart,\nEver let the mirror of your heart gather the hordes of demons.\n\nThe Ode says:\nLet not this one be seized by the hordes of demons,\nBattle the Three Corpses to break free from the net.\nThe waves of the bitter sea run deep—best to climb ashore,\nThe winds of the river of love blow fierce—best to ascend the slope.\nIf only you can grasp the nature of true emptiness,\nLet the myriad realms arise as they may.\nWillow green and peach red are but illusions—\nOnly fit to bow your head and laugh, hehe.\n\nWhenever you behold the true form of the Northern Dipper,\nProstrate and revere it with utmost respect.\n\nNow the Dao is originally formless,\nThus it nurtures all things and thereby takes form.\nThough it has an image,\nIt embraces the Dao and is fundamentally formless.\nThus there is the false because there is the true,\nWithout the true, there is no false.\nThe Dao conceals itself within the myriad things,\nAwakening comes only before your eyes.\nPeople cling to what lies beyond one direction,\nWhen deluded, where can they search for it?\n\nFor those who wish to learn the Dao,\nHow should they act to perceive it?\nOnly by following the good\nAnd retreating from all that is evil.\nAccumulate deeds and amass merit,\nAlign with the principle of Heaven,\nThen you will encounter an enlightened teacher,\nWho will guide you into the gate of non-action,\nAnd you will behold the mysterious and profound Dao.\n\nThus goodness and evil arise from the heart,\nThe profound principle emerges from the teacher.\nWisdom must come from oneself,\nThe Dao is revealed through the teacher’s guidance.\nThough you may meet an enlightened teacher,\nIf your own wisdom is shallow, you will not grasp the profound principle.\nYet even with keen wisdom,\nWithout a teacher, how can you fathom the subtle mysteries?\n\nO assembly, if you wish to learn the Dao,\nFirst follow goodness and retreat from evil,\nEver guard against wrongdoing.\nFrom dawn to dusk, never depart from the Dao,\nFrom moment to moment, never stray from wisdom.",

      "translated_text": "Thus practicing in this way, the Dao is complete in all its aspects.\n\nYet common beings often lose the true Dao—why is this? Drawn outward by the ten thousand things, the five desires rage within, chasing pleasure and clinging to life, they stray from truth and lose the Dao. Therefore the Most High said: Do not cling to external appearances, lest the heart be disturbed. It is but the illusory scenes before your eyes that bring calamity in the life to come—how can one not be cautious?\n\nSeeing the false, one awakens the true heart; encountering the true, one discards false intent. Consider those who, upon beholding the true form of the Northern Dipper, bow in reverence—why do they do so? The Northern Dipper is the pivot of Heaven, and its true form is the unchanging image from ancient times. Their bowing in reverence is the sincere devotion of the human heart.\n\nThe Dao is not to be sought afar—every thing is the Dao. Those who are deluded cannot awaken; every thing becomes delusion. Thus the sage transforms beings, recognizing the true within things, so that the great Dao is grasped in the palm of the hand. Therefore the teachings are expounded to prevent the foolish from harboring perverse views, from committing transgressions, to reveal the true through the false, and to deliver those who have not yet awakened.\n\nThe origin of good and evil lies in the heart. When acting, one should weigh carefully; where one should stop, one should reflect thrice before halting. Following this progression is truly wondrous—how could it not be fitting?\n\nAh! When the karma of the heart is eradicated, the three karmas are extinguished; where the demon of the mind arises, a hundred demons are born.\n\n*Verse:*\nThe Dharma-form within the pot is originally still,\nYet it is ruined by the thief of following thoughts.\nAppearing and vanishing in Jambudvīpa, coming and going,\nDrifting and sinking in the sea of suffering, twisting and straightening.\nHow can it compare to frequently awakening to the scenes of the homeland?\nBeyond kalpas, the clouds and mountains of the mysterious reach their utmost.\nIf you wish to know the true meaning therein,\nListen to the flute by the riverbank in the deep of night.\n\nThe First Star of the Northern Dipper: Yang Brightness, Greedy Wolf, Great Star Lord—those born in the *zi* hour belong to it.\nThe Second Star: Yin Essence, Great Gate, Primal Star Lord—those born in the *chou* or *hai* hours belong to it.\nThe Third Star: True Man, Wealth-Store, True Star Lord—those born in the *yin* or *xu* hours belong to it.\nThe Fourth Star: Mysterious Darkness, Literary Curve, Pivot Star Lord—those born in the *mao* or *you* hours belong to it.\nThe Fifth Star: Cinnabar Prime, Upright Integrity, Network Star Lord—those born in the *chen* or *shen* hours belong to it.\nThe Sixth Star: Northern Pole, Martial Brilliance, Discipline Star Lord—those born in the *si* or *wei* hours belong to it.\nThe Seventh Star: Heavenly Pass, Broken Army, Pass Star Lord—those born in the *wu* hour belong to it.\nThe Eighth Star: Cave Brightness, Outer Assistant Star Lord.\nThe Ninth Star: Hidden Light, Inner Counselor Star Lord.\n\n*Verse:*\nWho knows the nine orifices mirror the Celestial Stem?\nThe turning mechanism of the numinous terrace transforms all.\nForgetting intent when it arises brings blessings,\nLightness of heart in death becomes one’s own fault.\nSilently bestow the cinnabar palace to connect with divine power,\nLoftily spread the mysterious mountain to display sacred might.\nTurning to the azure sky where clouds disperse,\nThe precious pearl shines brilliantly with radiant light.\n\nUpper Terrace: Void Essence, Opening Virtue Star Lord.\nMiddle Terrace: Sixfold Purity, Minister of Space Star Lord.\nLower Terrace: Curved Life, Controller of Fortune Star Lord.\n\n*Verse:*\nTo nurture life, one must first sever worldly dust;\nOnly by severing dust can one refine spirit and form.\nWhen the clouds over the winding river grow still, the moon turns white;\nWhen the mist in the secluded valley disperses, the mountains remain green.\nThe cinnabar lightning sleeps where the wind howls,\nThe jade pool plays where the dragon’s waters ripple.\nWhen the sacred law of the Three Terraces is fittingly invoked,\nThe six demons flee in terror, finding no place to rest.\n\nSuch are the names and titles of the True Lords—ordinarily unheard of. Those who hear and uphold them possess profound Dao-heart and deep-rooted good affinity. To hear, recite, and maintain them brings merit and power beyond measure.\n\nMoreover, the Dao of the Most Sagely is impartial, bestowing its blessings upon all beings. Wisdom varies in myriad ways, yet the original face remains without distinction. The causes of good and evil are like rain and dew, nourishing the four kinds of life and the six paths. Yet how difficult it is to ascend to the Nine Pure Heavens, how easy to sink into the Five Dark Realms—all due to the greed, attachment, ignorance, and delusion of beings.\n\nIn this fleeting life, clinging to worldly illusions, they disregard true emptiness. They take cunning and opportunism as skill, deceitful schemes as wisdom, wealth and profit as glory, and sensual pleasures as joy. Thus they lose the true Dao and are bound to eternal rebirth. Their tongues are like three-inch blades, constantly harming others; their minds are like ten-sided ambushes, ever scheming to outwit. Do they not realize that Heaven and Earth observe all, like shadows following form? The retribution of good and evil, fortune and misfortune, will surely come.\n\nO assembly, do not lament the illusory nature of human life, with its seventy years of span. Half is consumed by night, leaving but ten thousand days. Within these, half is spent in worry and rest—how much time remains? How can one bear to commit transgressions?\n\nConsider the human body: the large and small intestines are its rivers and seas, the two eyes its sun and moon, the five viscera its five sacred peaks. The head is round like Heaven, the feet square like Earth. Heaven and Earth are born through the Dao, and the human body grows by the Dao. Since the human body shares the same substance as Heaven and Earth, why do Heaven and Earth endure while the human body perishes? It is because Heaven and Earth embrace the Dao and remain tranquil. Embracing the Dao, yin and yang unite, naturally circulating above and below in ceaseless flow. The Dao harmonizes with the True One, thus they endure forever.\n\nYet the human body betrays the Dao and stirs. It depletes primordial yang, impairs the function of the Dao, and fails to preserve its true nature amid joy, anger, greed, and wrath. Deeply deluded by external realms, the yang soul wanes while the yin spirit waxes. Unaware of the principle of embracing the Dao, the four elements and hundred passages are ravaged by demons—how can it compare to the steadfastness of Heaven and Earth?\n\nTherefore, those of superior wisdom who hear these teachings, awaken to understanding, uphold, recite, and take refuge in them, possess profound Dao-heart and deep-rooted good affinity. They encounter the true teachings of the Most High’s Mysterious Gate, escape the cycle of rebirth, ascend to the ranks of immortals, forever free from the tribulations of the six paths, and transcend to the bliss of the Ten Isles. They emerge into the profoundest mystery.",

      "translated_text": "Alas! Having encountered the Mysterious Gate yet failing to awaken—how long will the cycles of rebirth persist?\n\n**Verse:**\nThe Mysterious Gate finds few true kin,\nNot hidden in clouds or sought in deep waves.\nBut turn back along the fragrant willow path,\nAnd emerald mists and verdant peaks appear.\nWalking, one sees mountain blossoms bloom;\nReclining, one hears wild birds sing before the hills.\nThis secluded dwelling is no distant road—\nAwakened, it is truly never apart from the heart.\n\nIf faithful men and women encounter this true scripture, their wisdom-nature becomes complete, their Dao-heart unfolds. They emerge from the paths of delusion, enter the Gate of the Inaudible and Invisible, return to the true lineage, and attain the realm of flourishing life.\n\nNow, whether one treads the gate of the utmost Dao or strays onto unvirtuous paths depends on the mind’s wisdom. When the mind reflects and corrects its errors, transgressions vanish of themselves; when wisdom awakens to truth, the Dao arises naturally. If wisdom fails to awaken to true emptiness and the mind clings to deluded paths, how can the true Dao of the Mysterious Gate ever be seen?\n\nOne must follow goodness and forsake wrongdoing, abide in stillness and depart from motion. Within stillness, sun and moon reveal another three mountains; within motion, the six paths of existence are never absent. Stillness is the origin of the immortal’s emergence; motion is the root of the mortal’s entry into dreams. Thus the wise transcend.\n\nMoreover, every action may be right or wrong, every thought and念 may be deviant or upright. Right and wrong can be discerned; deviance and uprightness can be distinguished. Between right and wrong, deviance and uprightness, one should act with calm deliberation.\n\nO assembly! Who can abandon crookedness and walk the broad Way? Who can drink deeply of virtue and power, becoming joyfully harmonious? The wise mingle with the world yet guard against wrongdoing; fools encounter true Dao yet lack right faith. If there are those of right faith and good wisdom who encounter this true scripture, their wisdom-nature becomes complete, their Dao-heart unfolds. They emerge from the paths of delusion, enter the Gate of the Inaudible and Invisible, return to the true lineage, and attain the realm of flourishing life.\n\n**Wisdom-nature complete** means:\n*Wisdom*: The eyes see the myriad things, the body dwells amid the dust, yet the nature does not arise in chaos, the mind does not cling—this is wisdom.\n*Insight*: The functioning of the Two Modes, the true emptiness of the Three Mysteries—nothing hidden is not illuminated, no transformation is not penetrated—this is insight.\n*Nature*: The spirit that abides through kalpas’ end and beginning, ever present and enduring.\n*Complete*: Perfectly fused awareness, unimpeded and all-penetrating truth—this is the unfolding of the Dao-heart and sudden awakening to the true Dao. Naturally, one emerges from the paths of delusion, enters the Gate of the Inaudible and Invisible, returns to the lineage of the True One, and attains the realm of eternal life and flourishing joy.\n\nWhen the dust-nature is not eliminated, the three disasters arise together; when the Dao-heart unfolds, the six desires all dissolve.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe Dharma-mirror, radiant, veils the jeweled terrace;\nDo not tarry, lest dust defile it.\nSuddenly the wondrous Dao opens in true purity,\nShedding deluded paths and transforming sorrow into joy.\nRealizing that conditioned existence has its uses,\nOne follows the teaching where there is neither going nor coming.\nIf the message of the Dao is truly awakened,\nIts wondrous form and numinous power surpass the nine heavens.\n\nOn the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, one’s natal day, and the days beneath the Northern Dipper, one should solemnly prepare the altar, recite the scriptures, and perform the fast and rites according to the proper forms. The blessings are boundless, spanning lifetimes without end, never straying from true nature or falling into deviant views.\n\nThough iron ore is stubborn, through smelting it becomes a vessel; though the human heart is desirous, through embracing virtue and power and forsaking wrongdoing, it may be corrected. Ore unrefined never becomes a vessel; a person unrefined never becomes true. Thus, only through the master craftsman does one awaken, and only through virtue and power does one come to know emptiness.\n\nThe Dao is the origin of the myriad things; virtue is the source of the hundred practices. Thus the profound benefits of virtue and power pervade all—how few among the multitudes know their daily use!\n\nThough the Dao is formless, it may be seen by forsaking desire; though virtue has its mirror, it is not perfected without accumulating goodness. Those who aspire to the Dao yet do not see its nature—how can they be true? Those who establish virtue yet do not cultivate its practice—how can they be benevolent?\n\nAll who cultivate Dao and virtue must embrace purity and truth, guard stillness, fill the belly and empty the heart, yield to others, and humble themselves with reverence. Without following these principles, those who study the Dao and cultivate truth will ultimately fail.\n\nBefore attaining the Dao, the mortal’s illusory body and nature arise from unequal good and evil, disparate fortune and misfortune—all governed by the celestial and terrestrial bureaus, officials who oversee life and death, punishing transgressions and rewarding goodness. Thus, on the Eight Festivals, the Three Primes, one’s natal day, and beneath the Northern Dipper, one should solemnly prepare the altar, recite the scriptures, perform the fast and rites, contemplate truth, invoke the Dao, repent transgressions, and pray for blessings. Thus sins will surely be erased, blessings will surely descend, one will not stray from true nature or fall into deviant views, and may preserve one’s heavenly years, attaining the Dao and enduring forever.\n\nIf one is submerged in deviant views, one strays from truth; straying from truth, one corrupts the Dao; corrupting the Dao, sins arise; sins arising, the form perishes.\n\nAlas! Through the madness of the inch-long heart, one falls into the river of delusion; trusting the six thieves’ deceptive clamor, one is ensnared in the net of karma. How much better to refine a single grain of golden elixir, shedding the illusory transformations of the four births, attaining freedom beyond the world, merging with the Dao in truth, at ease in the profoundest mystery, without hindrance or obstruction.\n\n**Verse:**\nWithin the body lies another numinous realm,\nIts perfect fusion named the Profound and Obscure.\nSight and hearing know not its form,\nYet through the mysterious, it ever unites with the spirit.\nThe laurel moon hangs as a bright mirror,\nThe pine-clad mountain leans as an emerald screen.\nHigh and low, the mountain moon is unobstructed—\nAll is forgotten, the two forms dissolved.\n\nThose who uphold this scripture should constantly recite the honorific titles of the Seven True Lords of the Primes. When their merit is complete, auspicious blessings will descend.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThere exists another majestic realm,\nUnobstructed, unconditioned, naturally at ease.\nNot a trace of worldly dust lingers in the heart—\nSeated, one feels the protection and love of the myriad spirits.",

      "translated_text": "**On the Mysteries of the Daoist Gate for All Disciples**\n\nAll within the Daoist gate should attend carefully to these matters. Those who cultivate the Real must focus on the root, for when the root is established, the Dao remains unharmed. Without knowing the root of the Dao, how can one reach the Jasper Pool? Thus the noble person attends to the root, and when the root is established, the Dao arises. To seek the mysteries of the Dao, first secure the root. With the root firm, seeking the Real is easy; seeking the Real while losing the root is difficult. Only when both root and Real are perfected does one arrive at the homeland of the Dao.\n\nMoreover, non-action relies upon action. Thus, knowing the root exists in the manifest, one distinguishes it from the unmanifest. To recognize the root, one must first identify its essence. Once this essence is discerned and broken through, the ears and eyes become keen. The true and wondrous transformation has always resided within one’s own body.\n\nKnow that striking stone produces fire, and digging earth creates a deep abyss. To cultivate blessings, act with goodness; to sever karmic causes, cut off conditions. To quench thirst, one must have water; to resist cold, one must have silk. To advance in the Real and attain the Dao, guard against transgressions and avoid faults.\n\nIf one can diligently recite and uphold the teachings, meditate on the Dao, and contemplate the Real—without regressing in virtuous practice—then when merit is complete and deeds fulfilled, auspicious blessings will gather and descend. The spirit will be bathed in carefree ease, and one shall forever enjoy the Great Mystery.\n\nAh!\nThough the fair scenes of the Three Isles are much praised,\nThe heart filled with wind and moon is yet more serene.\n\n**Verse:**\nLofty towers and splendid halls well forth with numinous springs,\nWithin dwells the Cinnabar Sovereign, named the Natural.\nThe Primordial Chaos unfolds into lush abundance,\nThe Void Cauldron of Gold revolves with true mystery.\nThe yang spirit guards and stabilizes the land of Three Clarities,\nThe yin soul subdues and captures the Six Cavern Heavens.\nDo not be deluded by illusory dreams at your pillow’s edge,\nLest the cold moon fill the fisherman’s boat in solitude.\n\nThen follows the incantation of the Northern Dipper:\n\nNorthern Dipper of the Nine Luminaries, great deities of the central heavens,\nAbove you ascend to the Golden Palace, below you cover Kunlun.\nYou regulate the cosmic order, govern the cosmos.\nGreat Dipper, Greedy Wolf, Gigantic Gate, Store of Emolument,\nLiterary Brilliance, Integrity and Chastity, Martial Brilliance, Breaker of Armies.\nSupreme Jade Emperor, Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord,\nEncompassing the great celestial sphere, entering even the tiniest dust.\nWhat disaster cannot be eradicated? What blessing cannot be attained?\nThe primal qi of the Original Sovereign comes to merge with my body.\nWherever the Celestial Stem points, it revolves day and night without cease.\nThe common folk, petty and unenlightened, seek the Dao and crave numinous power.\nMay they behold your august presence and forever preserve long life.\nThe Three Terraces of Void Essence, the Six Pure Ones of Curved Birth,\nGive birth to me, nurture me, protect my body and form.\n[...] Venerable Emperor, swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!\n\n**Verse:**\nThe Mysterious Female’s pivot and mechanism array the transforming spirits,\nOffering ascent to the Real and bathing in vast grace.\nAuspicious mists block the path of hesitation,\nThe new moon opens the gate of joyous ease.\nThe upright qi gathers life, pacifying Yu and Ji,\nThe numinous source protects and nurtures, revolving Kunlun.\nThe Seven Primes, undimmed, radiate their luminous glow,\nThe myriad sages draw near to guard my honor.\n\nLord Laozi said: The nature, life, and five constituents of all people are entirely governed by the star officials of their original destiny. The spirit-generals of their original destiny and the star officials of their natal constellation constantly bestow their protective shade, sustaining life and preserving one’s allotted years. Yet the common folk, ignorant, pass their lives without awakening.\n\nThe true officials of one’s original destiny descend to the human realm six times each year. The day of descent is called the *limit-period of original destiny*. On that day, three thousand messengers of the Southern Mound and seven thousand spirit-generals of the Northern Dipper, along with the true officials of original destiny, descend in the company of all the perfected to surround and protect.\n\nMoreover, the Dao nurtures the root of heaven and earth, and qi supplements the functions of the Five Phases. Things steal the numinous essence of heaven and earth to flourish, while humans steal the essence of the myriad things to seek stability. Thus the Three Powers and Five Phases, human relationships, destiny, and all things cannot be born without the Dao, nor can they stand without it. All things in the universe do not transcend the Great Dao.\n\nTherefore, the Dao embraces the myriad phenomena. When humans awaken to the One Mind, the myriad phenomena propagate through the scriptures—yet they do not arise from outside the Dao. The One Mind transforms and operates, and nothing is more substantial than the Real. Those who wish to learn the Dao and return to the Real, to cultivate the body and preserve their nature, must attend to what is real and true.\n\nHeaven can indeed be moved by the sun and moon, earth can indeed bear the numinous beings, and humans, among all the worlds, can naturally accomplish the true and perfect Dao, achieving the untainted.\n\nThus, with a true heart and sincere practice, the Dao is never empty in its realization of the Real. But if one’s heart is stubborn and unrepentant, how can sacred merit reach the gate of the Mystery? All practices must be grounded in true effort, for the great Dao of our Mystery Ultimate operates through the Real.\n\nAlas! The floating world deludes people, who regard it as false. Alas! Shallow-rooted beings of meager practice—how could they believe the Daoist gate holds other profound and wondrous principles? They only delight in sensual pleasures, compete for fleeting wealth, and take pride in riches. They speak perversely and vie to hear contentious words. When they hear of true emptiness, they react with arrogance, slandering the Daoist gate as if it were mud and sand. They covet what is not theirs and forget their nature and life. The wondrous principles of the Mysterious Real are veiled by ten thousand layers of mist and water. In the bitter sea of delusion, when will they cross to the shore of the Dao?\n\nBecause the common people are ignorant and do not awaken to themselves, the Most High opens his golden mouth of non-action, spitting forth the mysterious pearl to aid all things. He points out the path to the Three Heavens and blocks the gateless Nine Nights. Benefiting all beings, his grace moistens all ranks. He guides the most excellent to become celestial perfected, leads the middling and lesser to return to the correct Dao, teaches the Three Vehicles, and transmits the scriptures of ten thousand transformations.\n\nThis is because the seed-nature of beings differs, and their faculties vary. To convert those of superior roots, the superior vehicle is taught. But there are those of middling and lesser capacity who cannot grasp this principle. For them, binding the heart and refining the nature, silently and wordlessly applying the Dao, advancing the formless principle, and yearning for the imageless Real—none but those of superior roots can comprehend this.\n\nThus the middle and lesser vehicles use external conditions to reveal the inner Real, expounding the manifest to distinguish the untainted.\n\nAs for the true officials of original destiny descending six times each year to the human realm, this refers to the days corresponding to the sixty-year cycle of one’s birth year—these are the *original destiny days*. Each year, there are six occasions when one’s original destiny aligns, which are the *descent days of original destiny*. On these days, the star officials of one’s natal constellation and the spirit-generals of one’s original destiny descend to the world to observe good and evil.

      "translated_text": "The three thousand messengers of the Southern Mound are likened to the image of *li* fire, the three yang of the Cinnabar Yang Palace forming the three hun-souls. When activated, the numinous spirit is born and presides over the heart. The heart can restrain the form and spirit, preventing disorder.\n\nThe seven thousand spirit-generals of the Northern Dipper take the form of *kan* water, the abode of black yin. The seven essences open the seven orifices; when unobstructed, radiance pervades and governs the kidneys. The kidneys can securely guard the essence and qi, preventing their dissipation.\n\nThese are the loci of the original true within the human body. When the true origin resides in the valley, the Three Corpses, Seven Po, Six Desires, and Nine Worms all follow the Dao, and the myriad spirits and host of perfected come to surround and protect. This is the reality of the Dao.\n\nAh! If one comprehends the subtle message of the Great Mystery, Mount Tai transforms into the Jade Capital Mountain.\n\nA hymn says:\nThe shore of the River of Love is vast, waves delude the heavens,\nBest to withdraw and board the Dharma boat.\nRestrain the playful monkey to sleep on the herb-strewn path,\nLet the willful horse roam the fragrant fields.\nPenetrating the profound principle, the Dao is everywhere,\nAwakening to the subtle mechanism, Chan is in all places.\nOn a moonlit night, chanting alone, hoist the oar,\nThe homeland shimmers before the ancient peaks.\n\nThis can dissolve calamities, repent sins, invoke blessings, and extend life. According to one’s capacity, perform rites and offerings, and merit and virtue will increase.\n\nIf the term of one’s original destiny is approaching and one remains unaware, failing to establish abstinence rites or tend incense and fire, this is to trifle with life and be deluded about one’s origin, not cherishing the human form. The celestial offices will revoke one’s emoluments, diminish one’s allotted years, and often lead to premature death.\n\nThose who err in this way, even if they encounter scriptural instructions, harbor disbelief and slander the true texts. After such persons pass away, they sink into the Three Wretched Realms, drift through the various destinies, and forever lose the human form. Deeply pitiable, they bring this suffering upon themselves.\n\nJust as one seeks smoke near wood or quenches thirst near a spring, one shuns wrongdoing to draw near goodness and flees folly to approach wisdom. Wood’s nature is not fiery, yet drilling it produces flame; the human heart pursues desires, yet restraint gives rise to the Dao. Without the worthy, do not debate folly; without a spring, do not slake thirst; without the upright, do not recognize the perverse; without the true, do not know the false. By the false, the true is revealed; by the perverse, the upright is known.\n\nFor instance, the Jade Terrace suspends a precious mirror, its radiance resplendent within. How can you, possessing a bodily form, hold the profound mystery of the Great Dao yet remain devoid of it? The precious mirror is the original true; what appears within it is the illusory bodily form. The true is concealed within the false. One should polish the heart-mirror to remove even the finest speck of dust. When one’s nature harmonizes with the Dao, it pervades the ten thousand realms. The Great Dao encompasses all things; when one’s nature is contained, the mind is never disordered. Once one knows the ten thousand things to be false, the solitary mind alone illumines the true. If one grasps and uses things, there is no way to delight in the Dao; if one departs from things in speech, there is no path to ascend to heaven. This is like gazing toward the sea’s edge and suddenly beholding the osmanthus moon, or strolling a mountain path and instantly sensing the pine wind. Through aversion, one may follow goodness; through the false, one may know the true. Through the ordinary, one knows the sage; through the sprout, one knows the root.\n\nMoreover, the common people in the world, the multitude of beings, do not use false things to point to the true—how then can they discern forms? Without using dharmic appearances to transmit emptiness, how can they recognize the formless? Thus, the sages bestow transformation for the sake of the unenlightened.\n\nTherefore, the Most High said: “Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.”\n\nIf all of us, the multitude of beings, awaken to this Great Dao, know the term of our original destiny, and advance along the immortal’s steps by upholding this profound scripture with unwavering dedication, our merit and virtue will naturally increase.\n\nIf one does not progress in the mysterious work but is instead one who trifles with life and abandons destiny, one’s inherent nature will enter another bodily form, the heart will gather myriad sorrows like ashes, and when will the river of karma become clear? One will be bound and imprisoned in the iron domain—how can one ever rest?\n\nBetter to rely on a single wisdom to ascend the heavenly path; do not follow the Three Corpses to become a prisoner of the earth.\n\nA hymn says:\nPractice the true according to your capacity, and you will see the true;\nArduous cultivation requires diligence from the outset.\nOne must undertake genuine and steadfast practice\nTo enter the gate of non-action and attain freedom.\nThe sea of karma has no thousand-mile shore,\nThe Penglai Mountains are obscured by ten thousand layers of clouds.\nWhere the fisherman’s lamp shines, the cold river is still,\nGulls and egrets take startled flight, losing their former flock.\n\nIf on the days of one’s original destiny one performs abstinence rites and communicates with the celestial offices, within the term of one’s original destiny one may open and transmit the true scripture, widely present offerings, and thereby ensure that for three lifetimes one will always be reborn as a man, wealthy, noble, intelligent, and preeminent among people.\n\nIt is said that emotions arise from things, perceptions from the mind. When desire and emotion arise, the Three Mountains become Fengdu; when desire and emotion cease, the Nine Nights become the Mysterious Mansion. Generally, why do the host of demons and myriad sufferings come? Why do the Eight Difficulties and Ten Entanglements arise? Desires are the root of the host of demons and myriad sufferings; disordered nature is the chief of the Eight Difficulties and Ten Entanglements. Desire has no root—it is the eye that leads desire; demons have no hindrance—it is the heart that gives rise to demons. Thus, the five tones deafen the ears, and the five colors blind the eyes.\n\nThe *Yin Fu Jing* states: “The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in seeing. Cut off the source of profit, and your forces are tenfold; reverse this three times day and night, and your forces are ten thousandfold.”\n\nAll the myriad conditions and thousand practices arise from the single heart.\n\nIt is also said: The green willows and red peaches are illusory transformations before one’s eyes; the clear wind and white moon are the livelihood beyond the kalpa. If one silently illuminates the Great Tenuity, the spirit is born in the Cinnabar Palace; if one is deluded by worldly desires, the po-soul falls into the Cold Pool. The myriad dusts and leaks, the ten thousand kinds and ends—one need only recognize the original within the false and seek the substantial appearance within the formless. Then one may practice the Great Dao.\n\nOh, the assembly! The present circumstances are vast and multifarious, the delusions of worldly states are endless. The seven emotions and six desires, the five ghosts and three corpses, transform into demons to deceive you into the river of delusion, using worldly pleasures to lure you into the sea of karma. All manner of calamities descend—how can one bear them? One must only subdue the heart, and the host of demons will submit; restrain desire, and the myriad sufferings will dissolve. When the heart is extinguished, the ten thousand dharmas are extinguished; when emotions arise, the myriad sufferings arise. Entering the mysterious gate of the Dao, the night palace of the hidden pass, the path is fundamentally one, yet one may walk two ways. The numinous spirit shines, opening the light of the Nine Nights; the po-soul scatters, darkening the Three Mountains. The joys of heaven, the imprisonment of hell, the fruits of wrongdoing, the causes of good acts—all transform according to the spirit-terrace and manifest from wisdom and nature.",

      "translated_text": "If there are sentient beings who understand the principle of their original destiny, purify themselves through fasting and precepts, and extinguish the leaks of worldly dust, their meritorious deeds will ascend to the heavenly courts, granting them dignified and majestic countenances, attaining the rank of Perfected Ones, and crossing beyond the sea of suffering—all because they subdued the heart and overcame demons, embraced goodness and renounced evil, thus ascending to the carefree immortal realms, avoiding the shackles of dark prisons.\n\nFor those who uphold the scriptures and cultivate the Dao, following the texts of the Most High and transgressing none of the sacred prohibitions, attaining the Dao and becoming immortals, they receive the grace of the ancient sages. How shall they repay this? As the *Song of Realizing the Dao* says: \"To grind one’s bones to powder is still insufficient repayment; a single thought of clarity transcends kalpas beyond count.\"\n\nOne must only yearn for the Dao with clarity, purifying the heart until it is free of defilement—this is to not betray the principle of heaven and earth.\n\nHark!\nChisel open the stone wall, and no barrier remains;\nThe ten thousand images and all phenomena appear within the palm.\n\nA eulogy says:\nThe mysterious and numinous, in great compassion, delivers from the cage;\nBroadly transforming the Three Vehicles to awaken to the Great Void.\nBefore your eyes, you know what to take and use—\nDo not seek traces in the clouds where others speak.\n\nThe peach-laden Han and willow-lined shores are your family’s affairs;\nThe osmanthus moon and pine winds are the legacy of my ancestors.\nHow laughable are those many Dao-seekers\nWho chase after worldly scenes, running east and west.\n\nFor those whose karmic endowment is meager, though born among humans, poor and lowly, even if they understand their original destiny but lack the means to cultivate, if they can pour water or offer flowers, silently turn their minds toward the Northern Culmen, bow in reverence, and invoke the name of their Original Destiny True Lord, they shall not pass their destined lifespan in vain. All will gain extended life and recorded blessings, securing human rebirth in every generation, dispelling calamities, and obtaining boundless fortune.\n\nThe Heavenly Master rejoiced, leapt with joy, and bowed in reverence, praising the rare encounter with this supreme Dharma-bridge.\n\nNow, the nature of water is perfectly level, yet waves arise with the wind; the human heart is originally still, but movement arises from external things. When things do not cling, emotions do not arise; when the heart remains empty, desires naturally fade. Love and desire arise from the heart, while form and spirit are lost to external things. Adrift in the boundless sea of karma without returning to shore, one drifts at will; dimly traversing the paths of Fengdu, one follows perilous routes—only when the time is lost does one awaken, like propping up a shadow at noon to guard against sorrow.\n\nO assembly! Greed, infatuation, delusion, stinginess, and miserliness—how pitiful that foolish people do not awaken! These are the causes of losing one’s nature and life, the roots of straying from the true mystery. Worldly pleasures and blind attachment bring no benefit; the opening of the Dao-heart is our true glory. Clouds and mist in secluded caves idle away the light of sun and moon; ornate pavilions and splendid halls reveal the changes of stars and frost. Beyond the world, apart from dust, there is another realm of carefree wandering—how can the fleeting vanities and worldly pleasures of the mundane realm be free from harm?\n\nThose who cultivate truth and refine their nature must, within the twelve hours and one hundred moments of each day, in all actions whether moving or still, keep body and mind pure, always establishing expedient means. Naturally, merits and deeds will accumulate, goodness will reach the Three Heavens, and one will ascend to Perfection and attain the Dao.\n\nThus, the Most High has said: \"Advancing goodness is like stealing.\" Therefore, in the dusty world, one harmonizes with light and follows the times, establishing goodness according to conditions. If one speaks of goodness but does not practice it, the gate to realizing the Dao remains closed; if one sees wrongdoing and can renounce it, the path to ascending as a Perfected One lies open.\n\nThose who wish to cultivate truth and learn immortality must establish truthful conduct. Though in the world, poverty and nobility, high and low, each have their distinctions, the Great Dao and true emptiness are truly without differentiation. Some advance the Dao through solemn wisdom and a pure heart; some set up banners and arrange images to pray for blessings. Though the methods differ, all lead to the same path. While worldly conditions vary between wealth and poverty, the heart of heaven makes no distinction between high and low. If one can arouse a single thought of advancing the Dao and doing good, externally, the celestial and terrestrial spirits will protect them; internally, their original destiny, form, and spirit will delight. Naturally, calamities will be dispelled, and boundless fortune obtained.\n\nAt this time, the Heavenly Master received this scripture, overflowing with joy.\n\nThe Heavenly Master is one who upholds the Dao and assists rectitude—thus called the Teacher of Heaven. Those who stray from the true and pursue the perverse are called ghosts of the earth. Therefore, those who awaken to the Great Dao of truth may truly be said to have encountered the supreme Dharma-bridge.\n\nHark!\nOne spirit upholds rectitude, free of deceit;\nThe Three Realms’ carefree wandering all lie within.",

Before the sun and moon took shape, qi resided within the Great Simplicity. When one qi sufficed, the Yellow Center governed; when the Great Simplicity dispersed, the myriad things began to arise. The Three Powers spread transformation among the host of spirits; the Six Movements breathed through the bellows. Cold and heat shifted in alternation; the pitch-pipes harmonized in resonance. Above, the radiance of sun and moon scattered, arraying the stars; below, the clear and turbid sediments congealed, forming hills and mountains. All things were born and nurtured; all beings flourished and multiplied. Yet when humans plunder the myriad things to attain peace, things deplete humans to attain the Dao. Spring’s luxuriance yields to autumn’s decline; there is birth, and thus there is death. If one remains formless and imageless, there is no death, nor any end.\n\nThe multitude’s eyelashes are not distant from their eyes, yet they fail to see clearly. The Great Dao lies solely within the heart—how could one cultivate it without recognition? Cloud-palace and Brahma-towers, jewel gardens and soaring forests—through form one discerns the formless; by relying on conditioned causes, one knows the unconditioned. Through action one attains non-action; through form one achieves formlessness. The numinous terrace, undimmed, reflects the Dao’s clarity; dust accumulates, obscuring the spirit’s radiance. When the numinous wanes and essence scatters, the body sickens and perishes. The three hun drift into the vast, empty paths of the yin realm—oh, how boundless! The hundred joints and bodily frame lie scattered upon the desolate mounds—how desolate! Though one may rival the wealth of a kingdom, what glory remains today? Though one may bear the empty title of six seals, what benefit does it bring in the end?\n\nThe world’s deluded cling to desire, losing their original destiny; they indulge in greed, exhausting their Horses of the Year. Their eyes follow peach-red and willow-green, unaware of the source of emptiness and form; their minds chase butterflies and blossoms, unable to distinguish the divisions of causes and conditions. In the vast expanse of the sea, within the swirling vortex, how long will they drift? In the deep recesses of mountains, within the cloud-caves of stone, when will their frantic scurrying cease?\n\nYet worldly people abhor dampness and dwell below; they fear death and cling to life. They do not know that life is the root of death, and transgression the head of misfortune. One ought to fear dampness and dwell on high; cling to life yet transcend death; dread misfortune and guard against transgression; prevent calamity and refrain from wrongdoing. Naturally, one becomes a carefree immortal of the earthly realm.\n\nMoreover, when sentient beings commit wrongs and violate prohibitions, their transgressions accumulate—what method can absolve them? What means can avert them? It lies in repenting past wrongs, forever severing future errors, and wholeheartedly contemplating the Great Mystery. Reverently and diligently honoring the mid-cycle of one’s own life-mandate and the Horse of the Year, one may shed the Three Disasters and Nine Calamities, safeguarding the present and ensuring the well-being of one’s kin.\n\nWhat is the life-mandate’s mid-cycle, the Horse of the Year?\nThe *yuan* is the beginning; the *chen* is the true image; the *yi* is the dwelling-valley; the *ma* is the stubborn beast. To invoke blessings, one must pray and supplicate, seeking the original beginning, aligning with the Great Dao, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, moving with the sun and moon, equaling the mountains, penetrating the profound and attaining the mysterious—non-action without hindrance. This *yuanchen* repents of transgressions and turns toward virtue, thereby dispelling calamities and transcending misfortune.\n\nIf one can bind the mind-monkey within the dwelling-valley of the self, restraining the will-horse, naturally the myriad disasters will not encroach, and the host of demons will bow in submission. Then one attains carefree wandering through the Three Realms, realizing the Mystery of Mysteries.\n\nHark!\nOnly when the self’s Horse of the Year is captured and subdued\nMay the original destiny shed the Nine Calamities.\n\nA Hymn says:\nStrike not the original spirit upon the Five Aggregates’ mountain,\nFor within it, illusory affairs abound in difficulty.\nDeluded clouds often cling to the numinous terrace’s companion;\nLove’s waves surge repeatedly within the cinnabar palace.\nThe Nine Calamities gradually arise as the monkey and horse flourish;\nThe Three Disasters turn and stir as ghosts and demons grow stubborn.\nWho knows the true message revealed in illumination?\nWind and moon, serene and untouched, remain undisturbed.\n\nWhenever superior practitioners uphold this true scripture on their original destiny’s birthday, they externally subdue demonic spirits and internally pacify their true nature. Their merit extends to the water and land realms; their goodness reaches both the living and the deceased. Through repentance and reverence, they gradually ascend to wondrous fruition, reestablish mysterious merit, and realize the Dao of Emptiness. Thus they attain sagely wisdom and perfect penetration, becoming unfathomable in concealment or manifestation, moving freely between being and non-being, wandering carefree among the clouds, ascending through the Golden Gate to unite with the sages. Their bodies transcend the Three Realms, forever freed from the wheel of rebirth, their lifespan boundless, their joy and ease self-attained.\n\nMoreover, the distinctions between good and evil all arise from one’s actions; the two paths of fortune and misfortune truly stem from one’s conduct. Generally, when illusory demons run rampant, transgressions inevitably accumulate; when the karma of the heart is extinguished, sins also perish. Though one knows that good and evil, fortune and misfortune follow like shadows after form, they cannot be escaped.\n\nYet the common worldly multitudes do not know what is most intimate or what is greatest. Though they know only the Dao is greatest and only destiny most intimate—now that they recognize the Dao’s greatness and destiny’s intimacy, how should they seek it? How should they protect it? One must know that the hub arises from the wheel, and the net from its cords. With a single mind embracing rectitude, the myriad dharmas remain free from deviation. If one cannot respect what is intimate, how can one respect what is distant? If one cannot delight in what is internal, how can one delight in what is external? Thus, respecting the intimate naturally extends to the distant; delighting in the internal naturally radiates outward. Therefore, one may rectify the self, and all things will naturally follow without command.\n\nWhat is intimate cannot be disrespected; what is external cannot be delighted in without first delighting within. Thus, reverence for the intimate ensures goodness toward the distant; inner joy naturally extends outward. Therefore, one may rectify the self, and all things will naturally follow without coercion.",

Therefore, those who awaken to the Great Dao of truth may truly be said to have encountered the supreme Dharma-bridge.\n\nHark!\nOne spirit upholds rectitude, free of deceit;\nThe Three Realms’ carefree wandering all lie within.",
