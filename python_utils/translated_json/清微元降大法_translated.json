Twenty-five scrolls. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Dongzhen Section, Methods Category.)\n\n**Scroll One of *The Pure Subtlety and Primordial Descent of the Great Method***\n\n**The Primordial Beginning’s Pure Subtlety Responds to the Era**\nThe Primordial Beginning (Yuanshi), in the wondrous transformations of the True Origin, descended as the Celestial Emperor’s trace in the state of Qin, residing in the Cavern of Wondrous Preservation and Transformation.

The Supreme Clarity Perfected, Successor Master Zhang Heng, styled Attendant Within. The Supreme Clarity Perfected, Lineage Master Zhang Lu, styled Marquis of Langzhong. The Lady Master Primordial Lady. Their lineage flowed into Shu, its origins unknown; the fourth generation was the Imperial Censor Zhang Zi. Emerging from Shu to inherit the lineage, the Dragon Tiger Mountain in Guixi of Guangxin continued the immortal succession.\n\nOriginally, the lineage was revitalized by the Numinous Brilliance Sage Mother Zhu Xuan, who sat upon a stone by the river in Jiangzhou of Guiyang Prefecture in the Jinghu Southern Circuit and transmitted the teachings to the Golden Portals Radiant Congealment Primordial Lady.\n\n**Essentials of Lineage Transmission and Assembly of Ancestors**\nThe Golden Portals Radiant Congealment Penetrating Transformation Sole Brilliance Primordial Lady, while in the mountains near the Western Capital, encountered the Supreme Clarity Supreme Mystery Primordial Lord by the banks of the Divine Transformation Stream in the Pure Vacuity Cavern. The Lord transformed into a beautiful woman, bathing by the stream. The Lady then attended her with a towel, escorting her to her seat. For several nights, the Lord alternated between male and female forms, testing her resolve, which remained steadfast.\n\nThen summoning the Master, they boarded a wooden raft and floated upon the stream, whereupon the Lord blew upon them and restored their original place. The doctrines of the Four Lineages were all conferred upon the Master, after which the Lord vanished. From this point, Master Benzhen unified the Four Lineages into one.\n\nThe Supreme Clarity Supreme Mystery Primordial Lord Wen Yong resided beneath the halls of the Jinghui Taihe Palace.\n\n**Incense Offerings for Invoking the Master**\n*Incense for Inviting the Master to the Pure Altar*\n*Incense for Purifying Impurities and Summoning the Myriad Spirits*\n*Incense for Invoking the Thunder Spirits at the Pure Altar*\n*Incense for Purifying Impurities, Commanding Generals, and Dispelling Evil*\n*Fierce Incense*\n*Nine Black Incense Talismans* – Nine pieces of incense, inscribed as follows and burned in the censer:\n\n1. 　　2. 　　3.\n4. 　　5. 　　6.\n7. 　　8. 　　9.\n\n*Incense for Swiftly Invoking the Master of Qingwei*\n*Swift Incense*\n*Mighty Incense*\n*Consort Yuan*\n*Swift Incense*\n*Da Dao Yanqing Jiqing* – For prayers and summoning the thunder spirits.\n\nIf the talismans fail to elicit a response in prayers, draft a petition! Alternatively, attach a note to the front of this talisman, seal both ends securely with wax, and inscribe it with sincerity. Present it to the transmission lineage to invoke the Master Jun Zongzhen and summon the thunder spirits.\n\n**Three Primes Dao Supervisor Qingwei Chonghua Seal** – Inscribed above.\n\n**Invoking the Marshal, Dao’s Origin**\n\nDuring the reign of Yu, the Dao Lord had already descended into the world, moving between existence and non-existence, upholding the Way of the Primordial Beginning. In the twenty-fifth year of King Zhao of Zhou, on the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth lunar month at noon, Lao Jun transmitted the *Scripture of the Dao* and *Scripture of Virtue* to Guan Yin, along with the *Nine Elixirs of Great Clarity* and the *Hidden Writings of the Eight Heavens*. The teachings of the *Western Ascension*, admonitions, and other methods were entrusted to the Perfected Du. The Perfected Du was the first to embody the Dao and its virtue.\n\nIn the second year of Guanghe during the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate bestowed the *Corpus of Numinous Treasure Scriptures* upon the Perfected Left Immortal Xi of the Great Ultimate at Mount Tiantai (some say Mount Shangyu). These are the ancestral texts of the *Cavern Mystery* corpus.\n\nLater, on the first day of the fifth month in the first year of Han’an during the reign of Emperor Shun of Han (some say the fifteenth day of the first month), the Heavenly Master Zhang descended upon Mount Heming, where he received the *Twenty-Four Ranks of Secret Registers*, the seal, and the sword, establishing the lineage of Orthodox Unity and the Alliance of Might.\n\nFrom the Zhou to the Qin, Han, and Wei dynasties, though the Three Scriptures were transmitted in the world, their regulations and ranks remained obscure. Until the second year of Anxing in the Jin dynasty, on the day of the First Farmer in the jiazi cycle, the Purple Void Primordial Lady, the Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount, first transmitted the Way of Highest Clarity to the Perfected Yang, Eastern Flower’s Supreme Assistant and Controller of Destinies. At that time, the celestial scriptures and treasured texts—such as the cloud-scripts, dragon-seals, and the eightfold configurations of the *Assembled Writings*—were beyond the comprehension of the mundane world. Our Primordial Lady, the Perfected, distinguished their talismanic scripts and oral instructions, transcribing them into clerical script. From then on, their transmission flourished, becoming the ancestral lineage of Highest Clarity.\n\n**Establishing the Law**\nThe *Scripture of the Primordial Beginning* pertains to the Great Thunder Rites. The Great Purification Rites are called the *Celestial Treasure Thunder Purification* (also known as the *Celestial Treasure Purification*) or the *Jade Clarity Thunder Cavern Perfection Purification*. They comprise:\n1. The Heavenly Scripture\n2. The Cavern Chapters\n3. The Heavenly Chapters\n4. The Jade Chapters\n5. The Jade Writings\n6. The Numinous Talismans\n\nHighest Clarity corresponds to the *Cavern Mystery*; Great Clarity to the *Cavern Divinity*. The Divine Empyrean aligns with the Northern Culmen; the Great Tenuity with the Purple Tenuity. The Eastern Culmen corresponds to the Southern Culmen; the Northern Culmen to the Western Culmen. The Purple Sovereign aligns with the Purple Clarity.\n\n**Commanding the Generals**\nFor a Marshal, Vice Marshal, or High General, use one talismanic messenger. For a Marshal with five messengers, use one talismanic messenger. The same applies to purification and thunder rites.\n\nThe *Divine Pivot Thunder Scripture* states: The Heavenly Worthy transforms into Marshals; the Heavenly Lords serve as Generals. Yang becomes the Thunder Duke; Yin becomes the Lightning Matriarch. The left is the Earl of Wind; the right is the Master of Rain. The five directions’ stars manifest as the Five Thunders. The great deities of the eight directions become the Eight Pursuing Messengers above and the Eight Titled Divine Lords, talismanic messengers, and merit officials below. In accordance with the imperial-approved scriptures, generals are established following the statutes, their names memorialized to the Emperor, and their summons invariably answered.\n\n**Talisman of the Primordial Lady’s Incense of Faith**\nThe Golden Portal’s Illustrious Congealed Dao-Transforming Radiance, the Primordial Lady, Ancestor of the Dao. The Primordial Lady’s transformed appearance: unbound hair, crimson robes with long skirts, holding a thunder casket, riding a blue-gold dragon, accompanied by two Perfected Lords.\n\n1. 　　2. 　　3.\n**Talismanic Messengers**\n\n**Thunderbolt-Soaring Heavenly Wondrous Dao Responsive Transformation Perfected Lord Swift Talismanic Messenger Yang Jie**, wielding a comet-star sword.\n**Grand Unity Evolving Sagely Wind-Thunder Wondrous Dao Vast Transformation Perfected Lord Swift Talismanic Messenger Yang Xian**, holding a fire-tipped halberd.\nBoth appear as mighty warriors: on yang days, the comet-star is employed; on yin days, fire is used.\n\n**Talisman of Lady Xie’s Incense of Faith**\nThe Penetrating Wondrous Primordial Florescence Grand Unity Harmonious Primordial Lady Xie Jingang, upon the Jade Radiance Jade Terrace Harmonious Mansion’s Yang Valley Altar to the left.\n\n**Incantation:** *Rongsu han.*\n\n**Talisman of Hua Perfected’s Incense of Faith**\n**Talisman of Zhu Perfected’s Incense of Faith**\n*Ancestor*　　*Majesty*\n**Talisman of Li Perfected’s Incense of Faith**\n**Talisman of Nan Perfected’s Incense of Faith**\n*Zhou*　　*Zhao*\n**Talisman of Huang Perfected’s Incense of Faith**\n**Talisman of Zhang Pingxin’s Incense of Faith**\n*Kun*\n\n*End of Scroll One of the Great Methods of the Primordial Descent of Qingwei*\n*Scroll Two of the Great Methods of the Primordial Descent of Qingwei*\n\n**Jade Capital Lineage of Qingwei**\nThe Jade Clarity of Qingwei’s Jade Purity.\nThe Primordial Thearch bestowed the *Wondrous Mystery Scripture* in accordance with the Jade Strategy, conferring it upon the Jade Dawn Dao Lord.\nWithin kalpas, it resides in the Great Mystery of the Great Luo; at the kalpa’s origin, the Treasure Terrace of Luminous Primordial Purity.\nIt unfolds and propagates the wondrous Dao, preserving Heaven’s eternal existence.\n\n**Wondrous Mystery Scripture**\nThe aforementioned scripture is housed in the western corridor of the hall’s side chamber, within the Hall of Pure Mystery and Jade Florescence.\n\nThe Primordial Thearch’s Thunder and Lightning descended to teach the Qingwei Jade Strategy in response to the era, totaling one hundred twenty characters.\nIn Heaven, it was the Primordial Heavenly King who conferred it upon the Dao Lord.\nThis strategy elicits a response from the Jade Realm; the three characters transmitted within the strategy must be meticulously preserved and passed down.\n\nThe Jade Dawn Dao Lord bestowed the Jade Model, granting it to the True Primordial Wondrous Transformation Heavenly Thearch.\n\n**Jade Dawn Strategy**\nThe Nine Heavens’ Wondrous Dao True Conveyor Yang Yuanjun employed the Great Dao to transmit the *Mysterious Wondrous Scripture*, conferring it upon the Nine Heavens’ Cavernous Luminosity Xu Yuanjun.\n\n**Great Dao’s Mysterious Wondrous Scripture**\nXu Yuanjun possessed the *Jade Brahma Chapter of the Primordial Capital*, which he conferred upon Zhu Perfected of the Jade Hall Celestial Mountain.\n\n**Jade Brahma Chapter of the Primordial Capital**\nFormed from Brahma qi, it governs the separation of purity and turbidity.\nTo the right, it examines the myriad spirits—all are the Primordial Thearch’s prohibited texts.\nAfter receiving this from Yang Yuanjun, it was left to be inherited through generations.\n\nThe Perfected of Celestial Mountain subsequently bestowed the *Thunder’s Radiance Shaking the Primordial Chapter* upon the Grand Mystery’s Azure Wisdom Illuminating Transformation Fusang Bu Perfected Lord.\n\n**Thunder’s Radiance Shaking the Primordial Chapter**\nBu Perfected Lord employed the *Great Dao’s Immeasurable Primordial Radiance Jade Talisman*, conferring it upon the Illuminating Congealed Spirit Radiance Preserving Heaven’s Dao Transformation Vast Primordial Lord.\n\nThe Dao Transformation Primordial Lord bestowed the *Jade Florescence Treasure Chapter* upon the Luminous Purity Dao Florescence Qiu Yuanjun.\n\nThereafter, Yuanjun conferred this chapter upon the Grand Clarity Pure Wisdom Master Perfected.\n\n**Secret Oral Instructions of Qingwei**\nThe Cavernous Radiance of Qingwei, the Purple Florescence of the Precious Balance, the Primordial Harmony Illuminating the Dao, the Grand Unity’s Divine Splendor—Primordial Lord Wang Zhenghong.\nFull-moon countenance, phoenix eyes, single-stroke brows, unbound hair wielding a sword, vermilion shoes in the comet-star’s form, dwelling beneath the Purple Radiance Palace Tower to the right of the Grand Primordial Chamber of the Primordial Capital.\n\n**Treasure Mystery Scripture**\nPresented to the Three Clarities’ Jade Thearchs, the Queen of Earth, and thereafter used in obeisance.\n\n**Primordial Beginning’s Court-Mandate Incense Talisman**\nThe right talisman is called \"Three Realms’ Court Audience Offering to the Primordial Beginning,\" wherein the Azure Thearch is commanded to bestow the incense character.

within the Dao there is method; within method there is method.\nThe Dao within Dao: a single thought unarisen, the myriad things all quiescent.\nThe method within Dao: in stillness, dragon and tiger intertwine; in motion, thunder and lightning roar.\nThe method within method: pacing the stars, forming mudras, reciting incantations, inscribing talismans.\nAll beyond this is mere numerology.\n\nThe Great Dao is wordless—it may be grasped through spirit.\nThe wondrous method is untransmitted—it may be received through the heart.\nThose adept in practice: they enact the Dao, not merely its methods.\nThose adept in seeking teachers: they follow the heart, not the person.\n\nOne may ask: Does method distinguish between prior-heaven and posterior-heaven?\nIf inquiring of prior-heaven: there is only the One, yet \"Dao\" is but a forced name—what then is \"method\"?\nMoreover, the moment a thought stirs, it already belongs to posterior-heaven.\nTalismans, diagrams, incantations, mudras—these are but the least of it.\n\nPrior-heaven gives birth—birth without form.\nPosterior-heaven responds—response with emotion.\nQuiescence responding, response returning to quiescence—who but the perfected can attain this?\n\nMethod excludes visualization—visualization is not true.\nMethod excludes fabrication—fabrication is demonic.\nMethod excludes shouting—shouting is madness.\nMethod excludes prayers and praises—prayers and praises are shamanism.\nMethod exquisitely harmonizes with yin and yang—square and round, movement and stillness, these are it.\nThe Dao penetrates the Three Powers—heaven, earth, and humanity alone.\nWater, fire, wood, metal, earth—correspond to the Five Phases.\nEast, south, west, north, center—governed by the Five Directions.\nHeaven, earth, water, fire, wind, thunder, mountain, marsh—paired with the Eight Trigrams.\n\nThose mired in numerology: when I inscribe talismans, I apply a specific function to a specific aperture—thus aligning with transformation, thus reckoning generation and conquest, thus commencing the brushstroke, thus activating the charge.\nThe mechanism of spirits and gods—I have grasped it.\nYet they do not know: before the Supreme Ultimate divided, what was yin and yang? What were the Three Powers? What were the Five Phases? What were the Five Directions? What were the Eight Trigrams?\n\nThus, those of the Dao cast aside their hands and practice—no talismans are needed.\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"Inscribing talismans without knowing the aperture—ghosts and gods will laugh.\nInscribing talismans while knowing the aperture—ghosts and gods will cry out in alarm.\"*\n\nPractitioners today, ignorant of the roots of Dao and method, vainly manipulate paper, mistaking it for the talismanic aperture.\nYet this aperture is no ordinary aperture—formed by the union of Qian and Kun, it is called the *Spirit-Qi Cavity*, containing the essence of Kan and Li.\nSeek it within the body—do not seek it elsewhere.\nOne who knows this single aperture may be spoken to of the Dao.\nHow could it be merely about method?\n\n*The Supreme Mind-Method Essential Preface* states:\n*\"Gathered as embryonic breath, employed as the aperture—within Daoist methods, this is the true essential wonder.\"*\nThis is a leaked secret—ponder it well.\n\nTalismans are the true credentials of heaven and earth; all borrow cinnabar, ink, paper, and brush.\nI alone say: a single point of numinous radiance, penetrating heaven and earth, where spirit resides—what is not a talisman?\nIt may be empty space, water, fire, tiles, stones, grass, trees, food and drink—it may be present or absent, communicative or transformative. This is Daoist method.\n\n*The Plain Questions* says:\n*\"Serene emptiness, tranquil indifference—true qi follows. Spirit guarded within—whence comes illness?\"*\nHuman ailments—whether cold or heat, severe or mild—all arise from improper regulation, excessive desires, and lack of moderation. Thus, the six qi’s pernicious influences seize the opportunity to invade.\n\nTo treat illness with talismans: talismans are but cinnabar and ink—how can they be inherently numinous?\nWhat makes them numinous is my true qi.\nThus it is said: Talismans have no fixed form—their numinosity lies in qi.\nOne who understands this may infuse any object with qi—even a grain of millet or a blade of grass can aid others.\n\nTalismans are instruments of yin-yang harmony.\nOnly the utterly sincere in the world can wield them.\nIf sincerity is lacking, they naturally fail to work.\nThus it is said:\n*\"With my essence, unite the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things;\nWith my spirit, unite the spirit of heaven, earth, and the myriad things.\"*\nEssence interlocks with essence, spirit leans upon spirit—thus, a scrap of paper may summon spirits and gods, and they cannot but respond.\n\nMethods may emerge from the same lineage—identical talismans, identical mudras—yet their application often fails. Why? Sincerity is lacking.\nWhere sincerity is lacking, self-trust falters.\nWhere self-trust falters, doubt arises.\nOnce doubt arises, the center loses its anchor.\nWith no anchor at the center, how can resonance occur?\nThus it is said: All methods are mind-methods; when the mind is open, the method is open.\nThis openness is the unity of the Three Powers and one qi.\n\nHeaven operates through qi, earth brings forth through qi, yin and yang contract and expand through qi, wind and thunder stir through qi, the human body breathes through qi, Daoist methods resonate through qi.\nThose adept in practice know: spirit arises from qi, qi governs spirit.\nExternal thoughts do not enter, internal thoughts do not exit—one qi, harmonious and balanced, returns to the root and restores life.\nIn movement and stillness, sitting and lying down, ceaselessly abide—thus nurturing the vast and boundless.\n\nWhen applied to methods, one harmonizes one’s true qi with the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth. Thus, exhaling becomes clouds and rain, inhaling becomes thunder and lightning. When employing generals, the primordial spirit naturally awakens; when subduing evil, spirits and demons naturally submit. Permeating Heaven and penetrating Earth, emerging from darkness and entering the unseen—what transformation is not mine to command? Yet if the center lacks an anchor, qi scatters and spirit dims. In practice, one merely clings to talismans and incantations, hoping for a stroke of luck in ten thousand—such efforts, I see, will not succeed.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the teaching on transforming spirit?\nAt the primordial beginning of the kalpa, the one qi divided into the true. I am the primordial beginning; the primordial beginning is I. This is called transforming spirit. Yet some sit with eyes closed, visualizing a general arriving from some direction. Others massage and contract, circulating inner qi to merge with outer qi. Alas, these are delusions. If one truly attains the numinous general—the teaching of the general’s numinosity—then in ordinary times and leisurely days, one nurtures spirit through stillness, and spirit naturally awakens; one harmonizes qi through equilibrium, and qi naturally becomes true in its function. In practice, spirit naturally unites with spirit, qi naturally unites with qi. With a single glance or a single thought, marshals, generals, officers, and soldiers teem as if at one’s side.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: The cosmos is in the palm of your hand; the myriad transformations arise within your body. Those who know this Way are the great Heaven and Earth, while Heaven and Earth are small to them. Zhuangzi said: The corpse abides, yet the dragon appears; the abyss is silent, yet thunder resounds. Those who know this Way may speak of the subtleties of movement and stillness. Thunder spirits come and go like flashing lightning; the world’s stale vapors cannot long adhere. Summon them swiftly and dismiss them promptly—do not indulge in empty formalities. When they possess a body, they illuminate its radiance; when generals descend, they report their directives. Sealing the arm with a single drop of water or rescuing the lost with a falling banner—if the spirit is not numinous, if the affair does not respond, these are mere techniques. They may be used to establish teachings through the spirit-way, but those who know the Dao do not rely on them.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the way to subdue evil?\nSimply cultivate oneself to rectitude. Have you not heard that the flower and moon spirits dared not appear before Di Liangong? Even ghosts and spirits fear the upright gentleman—how much more so the man of the Dao!\n\nSomeone asked: What is the teaching on refinement and deliverance?\nTo refine the hun-soul, one must first refine the spirit; to deliver others, one must first deliver oneself. This is the teaching of refinement and deliverance. The one nature is numinous and luminous, enduring as long as Heaven. Yet through greed and attachment, there is death and birth; the four great elements disperse, and no form remains to cling to. Still, one clings to the deluded mind, unaware of liberation. Thus one revolves through the six paths, emerging and submerging in the three realms. The Most High, moved by compassion, bequeathed methods and teachings so that those of the Dao might awaken their delusion with their truth, refine their yin with their yang, and quicken their spirit with their spirit.\n\nWith my qi, I return their qi. This lies solely in settling the mind and stabilizing thoughts, focusing the will and maintaining practice—if a single thought strays, perfection is not attained.\n\nAs for talismanic decrees and ritual protocols, these are but the outward forms of the teaching; the texts exist here, yet their essence does not reside here.\n\n**Qingwei Daoist Lineage**\nThe Jade Pure Primordial Beginning

      "translated_text": "**Invoking the Marshal, Dao’s Origin**\n\nDuring the reign of Yu, the Dao Lord had already descended into the world, moving between existence and non-existence, upholding the Way of the Primordial Beginning. In the twenty-fifth year of King Zhao of Zhou, on the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth lunar month at noon, Lao Jun transmitted the *Scripture of the Dao* and *Scripture of Virtue* to Guan Yin, along with the *Nine Elixirs of Great Clarity* and the *Hidden Writings of the Eight Heavens*. The teachings of the *Western Ascension*, admonitions, and other methods were entrusted to the Perfected Du. The Perfected Du was the first to embody the Dao and its virtue.\n\nIn the second year of Guanghe during the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate bestowed the *Corpus of Numinous Treasure Scriptures* upon the Perfected Left Immortal Xi of the Great Ultimate at Mount Tiantai (some say Mount Shangyu). These are the ancestral texts of the *Cavern Mystery* corpus.\n\nLater, on the first day of the fifth month in the first year of Han’an during the reign of Emperor Shun of Han (some say the fifteenth day of the first month), the Heavenly Master Zhang descended upon Mount Heming, where he received the *Twenty-Four Ranks of Secret Registers*, the seal, and the sword, establishing the lineage of Orthodox Unity and the Alliance of Might.\n\nFrom the Zhou to the Qin, Han, and Wei dynasties, though the Three Scriptures were transmitted in the world, their regulations and ranks remained obscure. Until the second year of Anxing in the Jin dynasty, on the day of the First Farmer in the jiazi cycle, the Purple Void Primordial Lady, the Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount, first transmitted the Way of Highest Clarity to the Perfected Yang, Eastern Flower’s Supreme Assistant and Controller of Destinies. At that time, the celestial scriptures and treasured texts—such as the cloud-scripts, dragon-seals, and the eightfold configurations of the *Assembled Writings*—were beyond the comprehension of the mundane world. Our Primordial Lady, the Perfected, distinguished their talismanic scripts and oral instructions, transcribing them into clerical script. From then on, their transmission flourished, becoming the ancestral lineage of Highest Clarity.\n\n**Establishing the Law**\nThe *Scripture of the Primordial Beginning* pertains to the Great Thunder Rites. The Great Purification Rites are called the *Celestial Treasure Thunder Purification* (also known as the *Celestial Treasure Purification*) or the *Jade Clarity Thunder Cavern Perfection Purification*. They comprise:\n1. The Heavenly Scripture\n2. The Cavern Chapters\n3. The Heavenly Chapters\n4. The Jade Chapters\n5. The Jade Writings\n6. The Numinous Talismans\n\nHighest Clarity corresponds to the *Cavern Mystery*; Great Clarity to the *Cavern Divinity*. The Divine Empyrean aligns with the Northern Culmen; the Great Tenuity with the Purple Tenuity. The Eastern Culmen corresponds to the Southern Culmen; the Northern Culmen to the Western Culmen. The Purple Sovereign aligns with the Purple Clarity.\n\n**Commanding the Generals**\nFor a Marshal, Vice Marshal, or High General, use one talismanic messenger. For a Marshal with five messengers, use one talismanic messenger. The same applies to purification and thunder rites.\n\nThe *Divine Pivot Thunder Scripture* states: The Heavenly Worthy transforms into Marshals; the Heavenly Lords serve as Generals. Yang becomes the Thunder Duke; Yin becomes the Lightning Matriarch. The left is the Earl of Wind; the right is the Master of Rain. The five directions’ stars manifest as the Five Thunders. The great deities of the eight directions become the Eight Pursuing Messengers above and the Eight Titled Divine Lords, talismanic messengers, and merit officials below. In accordance with the imperial-approved scriptures, generals are established following the statutes, their names memorialized to the Emperor, and their summons invariably answered.\n\n**Talisman of the Primordial Lady’s Incense of Faith**\nThe Golden Portal’s Illustrious Congealed Dao-Transforming Radiance, the Primordial Lady, Ancestor of the Dao.

What were the Three Powers? What were the Five Phases? What were the Five Directions? What were the Eight Trigrams?\n\nThus, those of the Dao cast aside their hands and practice—no talismans are needed.\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"Inscribing talismans without knowing the aperture—ghosts and gods will laugh.\nInscribing talismans while knowing the aperture—ghosts and gods will cry out in alarm.\"*\n\nPractitioners today, ignorant of the roots of Dao and method, vainly manipulate paper, mistaking it for the talismanic aperture.\nYet this aperture is no ordinary aperture—formed by the union of Qian and Kun, it is called the *Spirit-Qi Cavity*, containing the essence of Kan and Li.\nSeek it within the body—do not seek it elsewhere.\nOne who knows this single aperture may be spoken to of the Dao.\nHow could it be merely about method?\n\n*The Supreme Mind-Method Essential Preface* states:\n*\"Gathered as embryonic breath, employed as the aperture—within Daoist methods, this is the true essential wonder.\"*\nThis is a leaked secret—ponder it well.\n\nTalismans are the true credentials of heaven and earth; all borrow cinnabar, ink, paper, and brush.\nI alone say: a single point of numinous radiance, penetrating heaven and earth, where spirit resides—what is not a talisman?\nIt may be empty space, water, fire, tiles, stones, grass, trees, food and drink—it may be present or absent, communicative or transformative. This is Daoist method.\n\n*The Plain Questions* says:\n*\"Serene emptiness, tranquil indifference—true qi follows. Spirit guarded within—whence comes illness?\"*\nHuman ailments—whether cold or heat, severe or mild—all arise from improper regulation, excessive desires, and lack of moderation. Thus, the six qi’s pernicious influences seize the opportunity to invade.\n\nTo treat illness with talismans: talismans are but cinnabar and ink—how can they be inherently numinous?\nWhat makes them numinous is my true qi.\nThus it is said: Talismans have no fixed form—their numinosity lies in qi.\nOne who understands this may infuse any object with qi—even a grain of millet or a blade of grass can aid others.\n\nTalismans are instruments of yin-yang harmony.\nOnly the utterly sincere in the world can wield them.\nIf sincerity is lacking, they naturally fail to work.\nThus it is said:\n*\"With my essence, unite the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things;\nWith my spirit, unite the spirit of heaven, earth, and the myriad things.\"*\nEssence interlocks with essence, spirit leans upon spirit—thus, a scrap of paper may summon spirits and gods, and they cannot but respond.\n\nMethods may emerge from the same lineage—identical talismans, identical mudras—yet their application often fails. Why? Sincerity is lacking.\nWhere sincerity is lacking, self-trust falters.\nWhere self-trust falters, doubt arises.\nOnce doubt arises, the center loses its anchor.\nWith no anchor at the center, how can resonance occur?\nThus it is said: All methods are mind-methods; when the mind is open, the method is open.\nThis openness is the unity of the Three Powers and one qi.\n\nHeaven operates through qi, earth brings forth through qi, yin and yang contract and expand through qi, wind and thunder stir through qi, the human body breathes through qi, Daoist methods resonate through qi.\nThose adept in practice know: spirit arises from qi, qi governs spirit.\nExternal thoughts do not enter, internal thoughts do not exit—one qi, harmonious and balanced, returns to the root and restores life.\nIn movement and stillness, sitting and lying down, ceaselessly abide—thus nurturing the vast and boundless.",

I am the primordial beginning; the primordial beginning is I. This is called transforming spirit. Yet some sit with eyes closed, visualizing a general arriving from some direction. Others massage and contract, circulating inner qi to merge with outer qi. Alas, these are delusions. If one truly attains the numinous general—the teaching of the general’s numinosity—then in ordinary times and leisurely days, one nurtures spirit through stillness, and spirit naturally awakens; one harmonizes qi through equilibrium, and qi naturally becomes true in its function. In practice, spirit naturally unites with spirit, qi naturally unites with qi. With a single glance or a single thought, marshals, generals, officers, and soldiers teem as if at one’s side.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: The cosmos is in the palm of your hand; the myriad transformations arise within your body. Those who know this Way are the great Heaven and Earth, while Heaven and Earth are small to them. Zhuangzi said: The corpse abides, yet the dragon appears; the abyss is silent, yet thunder resounds. Those who know this Way may speak of the subtleties of movement and stillness. Thunder spirits come and go like flashing lightning; the world’s stale vapors cannot long adhere. Summon them swiftly and dismiss them promptly—do not indulge in empty formalities. When they possess a body, they illuminate its radiance; when generals descend, they report their directives. Sealing the arm with a single drop of water or rescuing the lost with a falling banner—if the spirit is not numinous, if the affair does not respond, these are mere techniques. They may be used to establish teachings through the spirit-way, but those who know the Dao do not rely on them.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the way to subdue evil?\nSimply cultivate oneself to rectitude. Have you not heard that the flower and moon spirits dared not appear before Di Liangong? Even ghosts and spirits fear the upright gentleman—how much more so the man of the Dao!\n\nSomeone asked: What is the teaching on refinement and deliverance?\nTo refine the hun-soul, one must first refine the spirit; to deliver others, one must first deliver oneself. This is the teaching of refinement and deliverance. The one nature is numinous and luminous, enduring as long as Heaven. Yet through greed and attachment, there is death and birth; the four great elements disperse, and no form remains to cling to. Still, one clings to the deluded mind, unaware of liberation. Thus one revolves through the six paths, emerging and submerging in the three realms. The Most High, moved by compassion, bequeathed methods and teachings so that those of the Dao might awaken their delusion with their truth, refine their yin with their yang, and quicken their spirit with their spirit.",
