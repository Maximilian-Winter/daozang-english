  "full_translation": "**Essential Principles of Cultivating Perfection from the Writings of the Orthodox Unity Teachings**\n\n*Title:* *Essential Principles of Cultivating Perfection from the Writings of the Orthodox Unity Teachings*\n*Author:* Unknown, approximately dated to the Northern and Southern Dynasties period. One of the surviving fragments of the early Celestial Masters’ classic *Writings of the Orthodox Unity Teachings*. One scroll.\n*Source text:* *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity Tradition*, Zhengyi Section.\n\n---\n\n**Essential Principles of Cultivating Perfection from the Writings of the Orthodox Unity Teachings**\n\n**Method of Absorbing the Radiance of the Sun and Moon**\n\nThe Great Fangzhu Palace is the constant abode of the Azure Lad, where those above are all lofty immortals and transcendents—Perfected Ones of the Great Ultimate, the dwelling of the High Ministers and Directors of Destinies. There exists a method for absorbing the radiance of the sun and moon. Even those who have already attained the Dao and become Perfected still practice it, simply by visualizing within the heart.\n\nVisualize the sun’s image, large as a coin, crimson in color within the heart. Nine rays emanate upward from the heart, passing through the throat to the teeth, then returning to the stomach. After sustaining this for a long while, with eyes closed, clearly perceive the heart and stomach. Then exhale, completing the breath, and rinse the mouth with saliva thirty-nine times before stopping. Perform this thrice daily—at sunrise, mealtime, and noon.\n\nAfter one year, illnesses will be dispelled. After five years, the body will radiate light. After eighteen years, one will attain the Dao and achieve Perfection, casting no shadow at midday. This practice repels the qi of all malevolent spirits and myriad calamities. Constantly visualize the sun within the heart and the moon within the Niwan Palace. By day, absorb the sun’s rays; by night, absorb the moon’s rays.\n\nThe method for absorbing the moon’s rays is the same as for the sun. Visualize the moon with ten rays, white in color, descending from the brain into the throat. The rays also reach the teeth before being swallowed into the stomach. Some say that for the sun’s rays, one should constantly absorb the moon’s rays from the first to the fifteenth day of the lunar month, but cease after the fifteenth, for after this day, the moon’s radiance wanes and harms the celestial qi—hence the instruction to stop. Others say to absorb the sun’s rays from the first to the fifteenth day, and the moon’s rays from the sixteenth to the month’s end.\n\nThis method was transmitted by the Perfected Ones of Fangzhu. The technique originates from the *Sutra of Great Wisdom*, Middle Chapter. Those who practice it diligently will witness the Great Peace.\n\nAs the Lady of the Southern Culmen instructed: \"The Way of visualizing the sun in the heart and the moon in the Niwan Palace is simple and easily attained. One must practice it assiduously, never allowing neglect. It eliminates the Three Corpses, a hundred illnesses, and a thousand evils—myriad malevolent forces. This is the Way of refining the hun-soul and restraining the po-soul. When the sun and moon constantly illuminate the body, malevolent spirits cannot conceal themselves.\"\n\nFormerly, the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea transmitted this teaching, and I now practice it—I am that very person. Today, I impart it to you. You may practice it, but reveal it only to those of sincere intent. Practicing this Way does not hinder the study of sacred scriptures. Thus, absorbing the radiance of the sun and moon complements other practices, yielding great benefit. The immortals perform a thousand tasks day and night without fatigue, for their devotion to the Dao is utmost. Cherish life—do not let this opportunity slip away.\n\nLord Wang of Xicheng imparted this to Lord Yang, who now reveals it to all the Xu. The above is excerpted from the *Declarations of the Perfected*, Scroll Three.\n\nMaster Meng’s Evening Repose Method\n\nShan Shiyuan received Master Meng’s Evening Repose Method: before sleeping, first recite the *Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court* once, then retire. This naturally refines and restrains the hun and po souls. Practicing this method continuously for twenty-eight years will lead to transcendence—equivalent to reciting the scripture ten thousand times. Reciting it three or four times each evening is optimal.\n\nLady Jiang of the Northern Marchmount said: even if the prescribed years of recitation are not yet fulfilled, this practice will still keep one free from illness. It is the Way of undying.\n\nExcerpted from the *Declarations of the Perfected*, Scroll Five.\n\n**Incantation for Inauspicious and Auspicious Dreams**\n\nThe Perfected of Great Simplicity taught beginners in the Dao a method to dispel inauspicious dreams. Those who frequently encounter such dreams are afflicted by three causes: first, the po soul’s malevolence; second, the heart’s trials; third, the corpse-demons’ predations. This is the method to dissolve and dispel them.\n\nUpon awakening from a dream, press the left hand to the philtrum, tap the teeth twice seven times, then open the mouth twice seven times, gently clacking the teeth while softly reciting:\n\n*\"By the Great Cavern’s true mystery, may the Three Hun be eternally refined:\nThe First Hun swiftly guards the Seven Po,\nThe Second Hun swiftly guards the Mud-Pill Palace,\nThe Third Hun guards the heart’s regulation.\nSwiftly invoke the Three Origins of Great Simplicity,\n[Name] has just encountered an inauspicious dream—\nthe Seven Po and roaming corpse-demons have conspired with the source of myriad evils.\nHasten to summon Peach Vitality to protect life,\nreport above to the Imperial Lords, the Five Elders, and the Nine Perfected.\nLet each guard the body’s gates, the Yellow Gates’ divine marshals,\nthe Generals of the Purple Portals, wielding cymbals and grasping bells.\nDissolve and dispel the malign influx,\ntransform misfortune into fortune,\nsever all ties with life and death.\nMoreover, may external auspicious signs manifest,\nwhile the qi of this inauspicious dream\nbe sealed beneath the Three Passes.\nAfter three years, only then shall divine resonance respond,\nand dreams henceforth reveal the clarity of things to come.\"*\n\nThen shall there be no more inauspicious dreams or ominous thoughts. Should one encounter auspicious signs or propitious dreams, and the heart deem them good, this is a response to virtue. Upon waking, rub the eyes twice seven times—swiftly close the eyes and with both palms stroke outward from within, then knock the teeth twice seven times and softly intone:\n\n\"Supreme High Essence of the Three Emperors,\nCinnabar Spirit of the Crimson Palace,\nIllumine and penetrate the auspicious resonance,\nReport to the Three Origins.\nGentle the Po souls,\nHeavenly Sovereign bestows the scripture—\nall endeavors harmonize,\nsoaring immortals ascend to the Upper Clarity,\never to assemble with the Jade Perfected in the Purple Court.\"\n\nThis is the secret formula of the Great Cavern, transmitted to the world for those who first cross its currents.\n\n—Excerpted from *The Hidden Book of Great Elixir*\n\nThe \"Mountain Source\" refers to the left side of the philtrum beneath the nose, within the pointed valley below. At dawn, noon, and dusk, swallow saliva thrice nine times, then swiftly press with the second and third fingers of the left hand thrice nine times—press firmly until it aches, not merely in haste. Upon pressing, silently intone:\n\n\"Open the Heavenly Court,\ngrant me long life,\npierce vision for ten thousand leagues,\nlet hun and po return to infancy,\nvanquish demons and repel evil,\nsummon a thousand spirits,\nascend to the Supreme,\nmerge with the sun,\nattain the rank of Perfected,\ninscribe my name in the Mystery.\nThrice daily, practice this method,\nand it shall render one spiritually perceptive,\na path to bar all malign influences.\"\n\n**Method for Clarifying Ears and Eyes**\n*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: The essentials of seeking the Dao begin with sharpening the ears and brightening the eyes, for these are the masters of all affairs. Moreover, ears and eyes are the ladder to seeking the Perfected and the gateway to gathering the numinous. Gain or loss hinges on them, and life or death is discerned through them. Now, the scripture is transcribed for practical use.\n\nThe Dao says: Regularly press the small cavities behind both brows thrice nine times. With the palms and fingers, rub the area above both eyes, then rotate the ears thirty times—let the count be without fixed time. Upon completion, stroke the forehead counterflow thrice nine times, beginning at the midpoint of the brows and moving into the hairline. Swallow saliva, without limit to the amount. Practicing this constantly will sharpen ears and eyes; after two years, one may write by night. The small cavities behind the brows are the Mansion of the Upper Prime and Six Harmonies, governing the generation of eye radiance, harmonizing and refining essence and light, nurturing the pupils to clarity, and preserving the spirit of the eyes. This is the supreme method for the Perfected in sitting and rising, also called the \"Perfected of the Sun,\" ever abiding in the inner scripture. A true adage says: \"If you wish to write by night, constantly refine your daily practice.\" The reason the Perfected can observe all four directions and illuminate the eight distant realms is truly due to the clarity cultivated through this practice.\n\n**Method of the Green Ox Daoist for Visualizing Sun and Moon**\nThe oral formula of the Green Ox Daoist states: At dusk and dawn, visualize the sun above the forehead and the moon above the navel. This repels a thousand ghosts and ten thousand evils, summoning jade boys and jade maidens to descend and dispel myriad calamities—a profoundly efficacious secret.\n\nThe Green Ox Daoist was Feng Junyi.\n\n—Excerpted from *Records of Divine Immortals* and *Preface to the Five Peaks*\n\n**Oral Formula of Shen Yi**\nShen Yi’s oral formula states: When ingesting divine medicines, do not face north—this is a great taboo. On *hai* and *zi* days, one must not spit toward the north, lest essence be lost, qi depleted, and years of life diminished. The potency of medicine becomes as earth—deeply to be avoided.\n\n**Oral Formula of Le Ba**\nWhen traveling through mountains, wilderness, or passing by numinous shrines and malevolent spirit temples, visualize within the mouth a Perfected One named Red Numinous Venerable, attended by two jade maidens. One maiden is named Hua Zheng, the other She Jing. The Venerable wears a red silk robe, while the two maidens are clad in yellow above and below. Upon completing the visualization, sharply command: \"Ghosts and spirits of the shrine, hasten here! Let all malign forces report to the Red Numinous Venerable to be beheaded.\" The host of evils will flee a thousand leagues. This is the method of the Three Heavens’ vanguard for capturing ghosts.\n\n**Taboos and Methods for Ingesting Medicines and Treating Illness**\nThe oral formula of the wife of the female immortal Cheng Wei states: Do not consume bloody foods, for they prevent the expulsion of the Three Corpses and Two Drynesses—even dried meat is barely permissible.\n\n**Oral Formula of Feng Gang**\nFeng Gang’s oral formula states: When a Daoist falls ill, they should close their eyes and inwardly visualize, using the heart to generate fire to burn the body and the afflicted area. Visualize with precision, and like a topknot or beard, the illness will be cured. Focus on the painful area and intensify the fire—this is profoundly efficacious.\n\n—Excerpted from *Records of Divine Immortals*\n\n**Preface to Primordial Qi**\n\nThe Perfected One states: Ingesting embryonic breathing and internal qi is the art of longevity. The *Yin Fu Jing* says, \"Without defense, life is not long.\" It also states: \"Winter grasses, when covered, remain unharmed.\" Thus, we know that the Way of nurturing life is none other than preserving primordial qi. This is why creatures that hibernate and burrow survive without eating—their breathing harmonizes with qi. Heaven generates the myriad things, yet humans are the most spiritually endowed. The hundred grains nourish them, and primordial qi sustains them. If one aligns their true nature with primordial qi, reduces thoughts and desires, relinquishes cunning, and detaches from the body, only then may they be shown the practices of bear-hanging and bird-stretching, tortoise-breathing and crane-dancing. These methods are not to be lightly shared, so I set forth their principles below.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Qi**\nWhen ingesting qi, first lie supine, close the mouth, and puff out the cheeks to fill the abdomen. When the mouth is full of qi, swallow it, contracting the throat to send it downward as if swallowing food. The throat has three passages: one for qi, which rises from the viscera to the mouth and slightly exits through the nose. When exhaling, contract to cut off the breath, then swallow. The swallow divides into two paths: the fluid enters the two kidneys, while the qi enters the intestines and stomach. If there is heat above and cold below, first ingest warm qi. If there is heat below and cold above, first ingest cool qi.\n\nWarm qi is drawn from the five viscera, held in the mouth until it becomes extremely hot, then swallowed. If the mouth is full of fluid and qi, contract and swallow—this is cool qi. It is also said that in autumn and winter, one should ingest warm qi, while in spring and summer, cool qi. Alternatively, one may assess the body’s own viscera and ingest qi accordingly.\n\nAt first, practice while lying supine; later, it may be done while walking, standing, sitting, or reclining. When puffing the cheeks, the teeth should be slightly parted; when swallowing, the teeth should be closed and touching. If they do not touch, the fluid and qi will not descend. After prolonged practice, the mouth may close naturally, and qi will effortlessly enter the intestines and stomach without strain. If the method is incorrect, primordial qi will not descend, and what feels like swallowing will only be a small amount of fluid.\n\nWhen contracting the qi, the teeth must touch without parting. If the mouth opens, the qi will escape through the nose, rendering the swallow ineffective. Precision is essential.\n\n**Timing for Ingesting Qi**\nIngest qi at the fifth watch, when food is fully digested, and continue until mealtime to forget hunger. Once proficient, if hunger arises, ingest qi. The abdomen may gurgle; if qi flows continuously, it will not. If the abdomen is empty when qi enters, gurgling is harmless. Once proficient, one may choose to abstain from food entirely or eat as desired.\n\n**Ingesting the Essence of Sun and Moon**\nTo ingest the essence of the sun and moon, do so at dawn or midnight, when vital qi is born, and only when the sky is clear. For internal qi, ingest whenever the abdomen feels empty, regardless of time or posture, and without limit on frequency.\n\nDuring the first seven days of ingesting qi, one may experience two or three bouts of diarrhea, with or without mucus, and reddish urine—this is not cause for alarm. Initially, one may feel stifling discomfort below the navel, which should not be doubted. At such times, light a lamp and incense in a quiet room, avoid distractions, loosen clothing, and lie supine with the limbs relaxed. Briefly hold the breath and visualize qi emerging from the five viscera, descending to the two kidneys, and pressing against the spine, where two white qi pathways rise along either side of the spine to the head. Visualize the qi reaching the hair, lingering brightly for a long while, then descending to the face, entering the five viscera, and continuing down to the Three Stars (the pubic region). From there, guide it to the Yongquan points in the soles of the feet. Then, rub the abdomen with both palms twenty to thirty times, and below the navel a hundred times. Relax the four limbs for a moment, and natural comfort will dispel all prior discomfort.\n\nIn my youth, Master Dongwei transmitted these secrets to me. Through diligent practice and self-regulation, I found them invariably effective. Using the hands is less effective than using the mind, for when mind and qi unite, the mind’s intent is met with qi’s response. In my early years, I suffered from various ailments—dripping sickness, emaciation, and consumptive symptoms—but through qi techniques, I recovered entirely. In the first seven days, minor changes may occur, as described earlier. After ten days of diligent practice, natural circulation is restored, and stability follows. One should occasionally ingest qi once or twice to maintain continuity; if a lapse occurs, resume practice. Excessive ingestion may cause belching or flatulence, which is not unusual.\n\nAfter seven or fourteen days of ingesting qi, one may eat food or drink wine without harm, though wine should not be consumed to excess, lest it disrupt true qi. Do not ingest qi on a full stomach; wait until digestion is complete. Those who do not understand qi ingestion but only practice visualization or use herbs to abstain from grains cannot sustain it for long. After hunger and thirst, sudden eating may lead to death, for the intestines and stomach become dry and brittle, and the nine orifices block, resulting in fatality. For those who ingest qi, eating is not harmful because their intestines and stomach remain open and receptive. When thirsty, drink broth or water, using fluids to moisten the body. Collect fluids by pressing the tongue against the upper palate and rolling it beneath and to the sides, gathering saliva.\n\nThose who ingest qi must first relinquish worldly attachments, aligning the heart with the Dao, and only then practice. Illnesses will then be easily cured. If the four limbs feel unbalanced, visualize the afflicted area and attack it with qi to heal. After attaining the Dao, one will be forever free of illness, feeling daily more light and vigorous, capable of long journeys. Even when passing through foul or pungent places, though uncomfortable, no harm will come. Sitting in seclusion, burning incense, and maintaining purity while avoiding external impurities is especially beneficial.\n\nIf one uses qi to abstain from grains but still craves food, this indicates a divided mind and hesitation. If one resolutely relies solely on primordial qi, over time, even the sight of food will not arouse desire.\n\nWhen the Dao of qi-ingestion is mastered, it surpasses both medicinal treatment and grain abstention. Though the body may initially feel weak, the practice of qi-ingestion is most wondrous. Over time, even wine and broths become unnecessary, and both urination and defecation cease entirely. If a dedicated practitioner has official duties and cannot focus solely on the Dao, they may ingest the harmonious primordial qi during spare moments—thirty to fifty swallows every one or two hours—ensuring that the qi-sea in the abdomen always contains primordial qi. Should illness arise, use daoyin techniques to guide the qi outward and attack the affliction, yielding immediate and verifiable results.\n\nThough one ingests internal qi, external qi is also essential. External qi refers to the essence of the sun and moon. At dawn, within one’s chamber, one ingests the blue-green qi. As the *Huangting Jing* states, \"The light of the sun and moon rescues the aged and infirm\"—this is its meaning. For those ingesting primordial qi, there is no fixed time; one may practice at any moment, ingesting whenever possible. As for the essence of the sun and moon, wait for clear and mild weather, when the sun has risen a *zhang* or more above the horizon, and then ingest. Face the sun, cup the hands in four bows, close the eyes, and visualize a beam of purple radiance from the sun entering the nose and mouth. Imagine the mouth filled with crimson light, then swallow twenty-seven times before stopping. Bow four more times. Relying solely on internal qi is inadequate; one must also ingest *shengqi* (vital qi), which is this very essence. Once *shengqi* is ingested, it unites with primordial qi, hastening the cure of illnesses. If only internal qi is used, healing will be slower. With prolonged ingestion of the sun and moon’s essence, the body becomes spiritually attuned and radiant.\n\nTo attack illness with breath-holding, the method is swift and effective. In a quiet chamber, lie down properly. If fragrant incense is available, burn it; if not, it is still acceptable. Loosen clothing and belts, relax the body, make fists, and slowly exhale fully two or three times. Inhale through the nose, then seal the mouth tightly. Focus the mind on the afflicted area, continuously directing qi to it until ten breaths are completed. Begin again from one, repeating this ten times for a total of one hundred. If the body feels stiff or weak, close the eyes, exhale gently, and rest for five breaths before rising. When attacking illness with breath-holding, the body should grow intensely hot, with sweat flowing freely—this indicates full recovery. Then, release the qi to circulate freely, opening the joints, limbs, and pores, allowing the qi to escape like mist or steam rising from rice. With time, this will become apparent. If the head is afflicted, pinch the nostrils shut and attack with qi to heal. Many know of ingesting internal primordial qi but are unaware of *shengqi*—the essence of the sun and moon and the blue-green qi of dawn. Primordial qi resides in the spleen, relying on *shengqi* to sustain it.\n\n**Daoyin Method**\nWhen the body feels sluggish or obstructed, perform the nineteen daoyin techniques:\n\n1. Rub the hands together as if washing them.\n2. Interlace the fingers loosely, then turn and press them toward the chest.\n3. Clasp the hands and press them together against the abdomen, alternating left and right.\n4. Interlace the fingers tightly, press them against the abdomen, and slowly stretch the body, alternating left and right.\n5. Mimic drawing a heavy bow, alternating left and right.\n6. Make fists and thrust them forward, alternating left and right.\n7. Mimic lifting a thousand-pound stone, alternating left and right.\n8. Withdraw the fists sharply—this is called \"opening the chest,\" alternating left and right.\n9. Sit upright, lean to one side as if pushing a mountain, alternating left and right.\n10. Clasp the head and rotate it over the top—this is called \"opening the ribs,\" alternating left and right.\n11. Place the hands on the ground, arch the back, and lift the body three times.\n12. Strike the back with the hands, alternating left and right.\n13. Sit upright, extend the legs, interlace the fingers, and pull backward.\n14. Place the hands on the ground and turn the head to gaze left and right—this is called \"tiger gaze.\"\n15. Stand and bend backward, lifting the body three times.\n16. Clasp the hands tightly, place a foot on them, and sway left and right, alternating feet.\n17. Stand and step forward and backward, alternating left and right.\n18. Sit upright, extend the legs toward the heart, hook the feet with the hands, place them on the knees, and press left and right.\n19. Raise the hands straight up to point at the sky, then lower them straight down to point at the earth, alternating left and right.\n\nPracticing these nineteen postures daily strengthens and prolongs life, preventing illness. If unable to perform all, choose one or two preferred techniques and practice them regularly to ensure smooth circulation of blood and qi. When performing daoyin, avoid drafts and hold the breath. After each session, exhale the stale qi without letting the ears hear it.\n\n**Observing the Four Great Elements**\nThe Four Great Elements, when harmonized, sustain life; when disharmonized, they cause illness. Observe the lips and mouth to assess their state: cold indicates an excess of wind, heat an excess of fire, dryness an excess of earth, and slipperiness an excess of water. Sound indicates wind excess, movement indicates panting excess, itching indicates qi excess, while silence and absence of panting indicate harmony. Illness may arise externally or internally. External causes include cold, heat, fatigue, idleness, satiety, hunger, and deficiency; internal causes include fame, profit, joy, anger, sound, color, thought, and scheming. Exhale through the mouth and inhale through the nose, neither hurried nor slow, naturally and gently. There are six types of exhalation, each treating different conditions:\n\n- For cold, exhale with *chui*.\n- For heat, exhale with *he*.\n- For wind pain, exhale with *xi*.\n- For rising qi, exhale with *hu*.\n- For phlegm and fullness, exhale with *xu*.\n- For heat, fatigue, and weariness, exhale with *si*.\n\nWhen the heart’s storehouse is afflicted, if cold, exhale with *chui*; if hot, exhale with *hu*. At night, if one dreams of a red-clad figure wielding a blade, staff, or fire to frighten, this signals disharmony.\n\nWhen the lung’s storehouse is afflicted, with generalized pain in the chest, breast, and limbs, exhale with *xu*. At night, if one dreams of handsome men or beautiful women falsely seeking intimacy, or claiming to be siblings, spouse, or children, this signals disharmony.\n\nWhen the liver’s storehouse is afflicted, with melancholy, sorrow, excessive joy, or pain in the head and eyes, exhale with *hu*. At night, if one dreams of a blue-clad figure wielding a blue blade or staff to frighten, or of lions, tigers, wolves, or other terrifying forms, this signals disharmony.\n\nWhen the spleen’s storehouse is afflicted, with wandering wind across the face, itching, oppression, and pain throughout the body, exhale with *xi*. At night, if one dreams of children striking pebbles to annoy, or hurling objects, or of whirlwinds swirling around, this signals disharmony.\n\nWhen the kidney’s storehouse is afflicted, with throat obstruction, abdominal fullness, and deafness, exhale with *si*. At night, if one dreams of a dark, headless figure riding an object, choking or overwhelming one, this signals disharmony.\n\nIn all such nurturing practices, one must regulate and harmonize the breath. At the hour when people settle into stillness, loosen the garments and sit upright, leaning the back against something soft. Loosen the belt, relax the body, and align the mind and nature. Regard life and death as equal, without dualistic desires, so the heart becomes calm. When the heart is calm, the qi is harmonized, and no harm arises. Thus, one who does not take life as life alone truly knows the art of nurturing life.\n\n**Observing Signs in Complexion**\nA mirror is placed to reflect one’s form and color. If the complexion changes, withdraw to a quiet chamber, cultivate the *Huangting Jing*, gather the spirits of the body, restrain the three hun, govern the seven po, pace the seven origins, and ingest primordial qi.\n\nThe form is sustained by qi, and qi depends on the form. When qi is whole, the form is whole; when qi is exhausted, the form perishes. Refining the form and preserving qi can safeguard life. There has never been form without qi, nor qi without form. Form and qi rely on each other to take shape—is this not the natural Way?\n\nIn complexion, red should resemble cinnabar wrapped in silk, not ochre. White should resemble goose feathers, not salt. Yellow should resemble realgar wrapped in gauze, not yellow earth. Black should resemble layered lacquer, not soil. Greenish-blue should resemble the luster of azure jade, not indigo.\n\nIf the complexion is green like overgrown grass, black like soot, yellow like rotten fruit, red like coagulated blood, or white like dry bones, these five signs portend death. If green resembles kingfisher feathers, black like raven feathers, red like a rooster’s comb, yellow like a crab’s belly, or white like lard, these five signs indicate vitality.\n\nA patient likely to recover can be treated. If a patient’s eyes turn yellow, rising indicates imminent recovery. If both face and eyes are red, the patient will recover. If the face is red and the eyes green, the patient will die. If the face is black and the eyes green, the patient will not die. If the face is black and the eyes red, the patient will not die. If the patient’s cheeks are flushed in round patches that do not disperse, the patient will die. If a patient or healthy person’s complexion changes like horse liver—appearing green from afar and black up close—they will die.\n\nIf a patient’s mouth cannot open and breath escapes, they will die. If a patient’s feet swell and the knees grow as large as buckets, they will die. If a patient raves incoherently, they will die, unless it is from heat illness. If a patient’s back turns green and the philtrum inverts, they will die. If a patient’s face is yellow and eyes green, they will die. If a patient’s face is green, eyes lack luster, and teeth turn black, they will die. If the hair dries like hemp and the ears go deaf, they will die. If a patient falls silent but the throat makes sounds, they will die. If the tongue curls and retracts, they will die. If the hair stands on end and the patient is prone to anger, they will die. If the brows and beard bristle upward, they will die. If the face and eyes are both white, they will die. If the face is green and the lips black, they will die. If the scrotum swells, they will die. If the eye sockets sink, they will die.\n\nA patient may exhibit five critical signs:\n- **Liver exhaustion**: eyes stare blankly, losing light and sight.\n- **Heart exhaustion**: aversion to seeing people, incoherent speech, curled tongue unable to speak.\n- **Spleen exhaustion**: craving meat and fat, nose collapsing, lips sagging.\n- **Lung exhaustion**: pale face, hoarse voice, tight skin, scorched hair, nostrils flaring.\n- **Kidney exhaustion**: hair standing on end, ears scorched, hearing lost.\n\n**Five Viscera Overcoming One Another**\n- **Liver disease** with black skin and white eyes: the lungs overcoming the liver, death at autumn dusk.\n- **Heart disease** with black eyes and black tongue: the kidneys overcoming the heart, death at winter midnight.\n- **Spleen disease** with blue lips: the liver overcoming the spleen, death at spring dawn.\n- **Lung disease** with flushed cheeks and swollen eyes: the heart overcoming the lungs, death at summer noon.\n- **Kidney disease** with swollen face and yellow lips: the spleen overcoming the kidneys, death at the midday hour of the four seasonal months.\n\n**Observing Critical Signs by Day**\n- **Liver exhaustion**: eyes lose light and sight, death in eight days.\n- **Heart exhaustion**: death in one day. If sweat beads and does not flow, death in one day.\n- **Spleen exhaustion**: craving meat and fat, lips sagging, death in eleven days.\n- **Lung exhaustion**: loss of voice, death in three days.\n- **Kidney exhaustion**: ears scorched, hair standing on end, hearing lost, death in four days.\n\n**Prohibitions in Treating Illness**\nThe Daoist methods save people from suffering and distress. In observing signs, one must not be ignorant.\n\nTo perform healing with prohibitions, first ensure the patient’s household selects a day of clear and harmonious weather, thoroughly cleanses the chamber, and maintains absolute quietude. When the Daoist arrives at the patient’s side, they must burn incense and carefully observe the patient’s spirit and qi. If the physical signs are dire and beyond treatment, one must still perform the method of preserving spirit and circulating qi, applying the seal thrice. At midday, return to observe whether the spirit and qi have subtly shifted toward improvement. If not, apply the prohibition once more. Inquire again at night to see if any change has occurred; if none, apply the prohibition once more. At dawn the following day, if the patient’s spirit and complexion remain unchanged, their life is exhausted, and they cannot be cured.\n\nIn treating illness, one must first value restraint in material gain. The Dao possesses a heart of deliverance, and the divine spirits will surely protect; the true qi will assuredly respond. If one’s actions are motivated by desire for wealth, lacking a heart of deliverance, all efforts will be ineffectual, and misfortune will instead afflict the practitioner. The Daoist methods of talismanic prohibitions are meant to relieve human suffering. It is essential to frequently invite Daoists to expound upon the thirty-six revered scriptures, elucidating the mysterious and sagely techniques of talismans and prohibitions. One should also, according to their capacity, study and practice the subtle arts. Now, in strict accordance with the secret methods of the *Zhengyi Divine Immortals’ Three-Five*, the techniques of talismanic prohibitions are set forth as follows:\n\nThe grand assemblies of the twelve celestial stems and the Three-Five reveal the hidden and the unseen. The methods of prohibition are among the Daoist arts of warding and defense, profound and manifold, with myriad streams flowing from a deep wellspring—difficult to master in their entirety. Yet when saving lives in peril, nothing precedes the seal. In ancient times, Fan Li employed it to cause mountains to crumble and rivers to halt their flow; the awe of its divine power stilled the thunder’s roar. It can melt metal and polish jade, restore qi, and revive the soul—how much more so for healing illness?\n\nYet ordinary people, shallow and obscured in the mysteries of defense, find it hard to attain mastery. Many practitioners today achieve no effect, largely due to insufficient study or a lack of single-minded devotion. As Li Daohua said: “I do not claim ignorance, for I have practiced this method since youth. The seal’s obscurity lies in the art of visualization. If one can refine their breath and clarify its measures, then visualization becomes lucid, and the divine spirits are fully present.”\n\nThus, don the cap and sash of the Five Spirits, and step the *Qianyuan* hexagram’s *heng li zhen*. Those who can achieve this will rarely fail to cure. Here, I briefly sketch the sequence with my limited understanding to share with fellow learners, though I have not yet fully grasped its essential subtleties.\n\nThe Sevenfold Qi-Mobilizing Method begins with purifying through water-spraying. Hold the water bowl in the left hand and the sword in the right, directing sword and water toward one another. Stand with your back to *jian* (建) and face *po* (破), visualizing before you a true official in vermilion robes, nineteen feet tall, wearing a nine-phoenix crown from the Registers. Take the water into your mouth and spray it toward the patient, the chamber ablaze as if with morning radiance. Then, with sword and water still aligned, envision the Dipper’s seven stars above your head, mirrored in the water bowl. Solemnly invoke the essence of the Northern Dipper’s seven stars to descend into this water, commanding: “All ghosts of the hundred infestations, flee ten thousand leagues! Those who disobey shall be slain and delivered to the White Youth of the West. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!”\n\nSpray in each of the five directions, then spray the patient. Step one *zhang* away from the patient, form the *dūjiān* mudra with the left hand, and hold the seal in the right, standing upright before the sovereign. First, visualize your own spirit: head crowned by heaven, feet planted on earth, your body enveloped in five-colored cloud-qi. Second, envision the Five Stars above your head, each in its proper quadrant, one *chi* from your crown. Third, visualize before your face the sun to the left and the moon to the right, nine *cun* distant. Fourth, envision above your head the Vermilion Bird, the Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right, and beneath your feet the Eight Trigrams, with the divine tortoise moving the seal, jade lads and jade maidens attending at your sides. Fifth, visualize five-colored true qi, thick as silk threads, issuing from the five viscera through your mouth, rising one *zhang* and eight *chi* above your head, then coiling threefold around it.\n\nNext, visualize three figures in green robes with green sashes emerging from the liver to stand at the left; three in red robes with red sashes emerging from the heart to stand before you; three in white robes with white sashes emerging from the lungs to stand at the right; three in black robes with black sashes emerging from the kidneys to stand behind; and three in yellow robes with yellow sashes emerging from the spleen to stand in the *bǐng* direction, each holding a sword in the left hand and an iron axe in the right. Then envision the seven stars of the Dipper crowning your head, their rays pointing to the patient’s afflicted area. Next, recall the true official in the nine-phoenix crown, riding the red qi of the sun, performing the *Yǔ* step while wielding the seal. Seal the patient’s heart once, the abdomen once, and the afflicted area once, imagining the poisonous qi scattering and dispersing.\n\nThen, holding your breath to the utmost, perform the *Yǔ* step along the nine paths to where the patient stands. Before sealing, inhale from the patient’s mouth three times, swallowing thrice and shouting thrice. Strike the celestial bell six times, sound the celestial chime six times—bells for summoning, chimes for subduing. Then recite the seal’s incantation:\n\n“The divine seal of the Heavenly Thearch:\nSeals mountains into lakes,\nSeals stones into roads,\nSeals trees to wither,\nSeals earth to split,\nSeals wood to break,\nSeals fire to extinguish,\nSeals water to cease,\nSeals above to penetrate below,\nSeals exterior to penetrate interior,\nSeals front to penetrate rear,\nSeals left to penetrate right,\nSeals evil to vanish,\nSeals pain to cease,\nSeals illness to disperse,\nSeals ghosts to flee.\nBreak and remove obstructions,\nDissolve misfortune and calamity.\nHasten, depart of your own accord!\nLet the proper spirits settle in their places.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Most High Lord Lao’s statutes and ordinances.”\n\nPress the seal while holding your breath for a long moment, then lift it and step back. Recite further:\n\n“[Name], male/female, born in the year [X], on the [day] of the [month] at the [hour], now suffers from [illness]. I humbly invoke the Three Departments’ Great Generals—the Seal-Wielding General, the Illness-Treating General, the Evil-Destroying General, and the Demon-Quelling General—to accompany the seal in curing the affliction within [Name]’s body. Hasten, depart with a shout!”\n\nThen, with the Yellow Spirit’s *Yuèzhāng* seal, seal the heart so the illness issues from the heart, seal the abdomen so it issues from the abdomen, seal the liver so it issues from the liver, seal the lungs so it issues from the lungs, seal the kidneys so it issues from the kidneys, seal the spleen so it issues from the spleen, seal the head so it issues from the head, seal the back so it issues from the back, seal the chest so it issues from the chest, seal the waist so it issues from the waist, seal the hands so it issues from the hands, seal the feet so it issues from the feet. “Depart swiftly, depart swiftly! Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by ordinance!”\n\nAfter pressing the seal, recite the incantation once more, then lift it. Hold the seal before your heart and recite:\n\n“Ghosts of the south, ghosts of the north, ghosts of the east, ghosts of the west, ghosts of the center, celestial ghosts, terrestrial ghosts, divine ghosts, male ghosts, female ghosts, ghosts of sunken corpses and poisonous infestations—those sealed shall die, those encountered shall perish! Depart swiftly, depart swiftly!”\n\nPress the seal and recite the incantation twice more, then lift it. Have the patient swallow two or three talismans—three for men, two for women.\n\nIn performing these prohibitions and treatments, one must visualize the true qi of the ten directions. Before enacting the prohibition, instruct the patient to abstain for three days from the five pungent foods, the twelve zodiacal meats, and all crab, fish, wine, and other foul or raw substances, permitting only a small amount of dried venison. Only then may the seal be applied; otherwise, it will harm rather than benefit. After using the seal, bathe it in fragrant water, dry it with new silk, and store it in its case.\n\nThis seal must not be brought into houses of mourning, households with postpartum women, or places tainted by blood, the six livestock, afterbirth, or filth. If, in the night, one is startled from sleep by strange sounds or disturbances, rise at once and cry aloud: “The seven spirits of the household and the Controller of Destiny, honored lords, why do these unruly ghosts dare offend the descendants of the Yellow Thearch? Seize and imprison them, delivering them to the wardens for punishment!” Then hang the seal on the door and step outside briefly—you will soon hear the sound of flogging.\n\nIf a person suddenly falls prey to malign corpse-ghost afflictions or faints without cease, seal the heart to halt it immediately. If a person cannot stop speaking with ghosts, seal them according to the method, and it will cease. If, while traveling on roads, entering mountains or wilds, or crossing rivers and lakes, one encounters wolves, tigers, bears, or other creatures harming people or livestock, seal their tracks—the tiger will flee thirty *li* and stop. If the seal is inverted, the creature will rush toward the person. For water-dwelling creatures like dragons, fish, turtles, insects, or venomous snakes harming people, mix yellow earth into mud, seal it, and cast it into the water—they will die. If servants or maids flee, seal their tracks, and they will return. If a person is suddenly struck by malign qi, or falls dead without apparent cause, or feels as if stabbed by awls or knives in the limbs or body, hold your breath, press the seal on the painful spot or the heart, and recite: “Evil qi depart, proper qi remain!”\n\nThe *Zhengyi* Ritual Texts: Essential Instructions on Cultivating Perfection—Concluded",

      "translated_text": "**Essential Principles of Cultivating Perfection from the Writings of the Orthodox Unity Teachings**\n\n*Title:* *Essential Principles of Cultivating Perfection from the Writings of the Orthodox Unity Teachings*\n*Author:* Unknown, approximately dated to the Northern and Southern Dynasties period. One of the surviving fragments of the early Celestial Masters’ classic *Writings of the Orthodox Unity Teachings*. One scroll.\n*Source text:* *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity Tradition*, Zhengyi Section.\n\n---\n\n**Essential Principles of Cultivating Perfection from the Writings of the Orthodox Unity Teachings**\n\n**Method of Absorbing the Radiance of the Sun and Moon**\n\nThe Great Fangzhu Palace is the constant abode of the Azure Lad, where those above are all lofty immortals and transcendents—Perfected Ones of the Great Ultimate, the dwelling of the High Ministers and Directors of Destinies. There exists a method for absorbing the radiance of the sun and moon. Even those who have already attained the Dao and become Perfected still practice it, simply by visualizing within the heart.\n\nVisualize the sun’s image, large as a coin, crimson in color within the heart. Nine rays emanate upward from the heart, passing through the throat to the teeth, then returning to the stomach. After sustaining this for a long while, with eyes closed, clearly perceive the heart and stomach. Then exhale, completing the breath, and rinse the mouth with saliva thirty-nine times before stopping. Perform this thrice daily—at sunrise, mealtime, and noon.\n\nAfter one year, illnesses will be dispelled. After five years, the body will radiate light. After eighteen years, one will attain the Dao and achieve Perfection, casting no shadow at midday. This practice repels the qi of all malevolent spirits and myriad calamities. Constantly visualize the sun within the heart and the moon within the Niwan Palace. By day, absorb the sun’s rays; by night, absorb the moon’s rays.\n\nThe method for absorbing the moon’s rays is the same as for the sun. Visualize the moon with ten rays, white in color, descending from the brain into the throat. The rays also reach the teeth before being swallowed into the stomach. Some say that for the sun’s rays, one should constantly absorb the moon’s rays from the first to the fifteenth day of the lunar month, but cease after the fifteenth, for after this day, the moon’s radiance wanes and harms the celestial qi—hence the instruction to stop. Others say to absorb the sun’s rays from the first to the fifteenth day, and the moon’s rays from the sixteenth to the month’s end.\n\nThis method was transmitted by the Perfected Ones of Fangzhu. The technique originates from the *Sutra of Great Wisdom*, Middle Chapter. Those who practice it diligently will witness the Great Peace.\n\nAs the Lady of the Southern Culmen instructed: \"The Way of visualizing the sun in the heart and the moon in the Niwan Palace is simple and easily attained. One must practice it assiduously, never allowing neglect. It eliminates the Three Corpses, a hundred illnesses, and a thousand evils—myriad malevolent forces. This is the Way of refining the hun-soul and restraining the po-soul. When the sun and moon constantly illuminate the body, malevolent spirits cannot conceal themselves.\"\n\nFormerly, the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea transmitted this teaching, and I now practice it—I am that very person. Today, I impart it to you. You may practice it, but reveal it only to those of sincere intent. Practicing this Way does not hinder the study of sacred scriptures. Thus, absorbing the radiance of the sun and moon complements other practices, yielding great benefit. The immortals perform a thousand tasks day and night without fatigue, for their devotion to the Dao is utmost. Cherish life—do not let this opportunity slip away.\n\nLord Wang of Xicheng imparted this to Lord Yang, who now reveals it to all the Xu. The above is excerpted from the *Declarations of the Perfected*, Scroll Three.",

Practicing this method continuously for twenty-eight years will lead to transcendence—equivalent to reciting the scripture ten thousand times. Reciting it three or four times each evening is optimal.\n\nLady Jiang of the Northern Marchmount said: even if the prescribed years of recitation are not yet fulfilled, this practice will still keep one free from illness.

      "translated_text": "Then shall there be no more inauspicious dreams or ominous thoughts. Should one encounter auspicious signs or propitious dreams, and the heart deem them good, this is a response to virtue. Upon waking, rub the eyes twice seven times—swiftly close the eyes and with both palms stroke outward from within, then knock the teeth twice seven times and softly intone:\n\n\"Supreme High Essence of the Three Emperors,\nCinnabar Spirit of the Crimson Palace,\nIllumine and penetrate the auspicious resonance,\nReport to the Three Origins.\nGentle the Po souls,\nHeavenly Sovereign bestows the scripture—\nall endeavors harmonize,\nsoaring immortals ascend to the Upper Clarity,\never to assemble with the Jade Perfected in the Purple Court.\"\n\nThis is the secret formula of the Great Cavern, transmitted to the world for those who first cross its currents.\n\n—Excerpted from *The Hidden Book of Great Elixir*\n\nThe \"Mountain Source\" refers to the left side of the philtrum beneath the nose, within the pointed valley below. At dawn, noon, and dusk, swallow saliva thrice nine times, then swiftly press with the second and third fingers of the left hand thrice nine times—press firmly until it aches, not merely in haste. Upon pressing, silently intone:\n\n\"Open the Heavenly Court,\ngrant me long life,\npierce vision for ten thousand leagues,\nlet hun and po return to infancy,\nvanquish demons and repel evil,\nsummon a thousand spirits,\nascend to the Supreme,\nmerge with the sun,\nattain the rank of Perfected,\ninscribe my name in the Mystery.\nThrice daily, practice this method,\nand it shall render one spiritually perceptive,\na path to bar all malign influences.\"\n\n**Method for Clarifying Ears and Eyes**\n*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: The essentials of seeking the Dao begin with sharpening the ears and brightening the eyes, for these are the masters of all affairs. Moreover, ears and eyes are the ladder to seeking the Perfected and the gateway to gathering the numinous. Gain or loss hinges on them, and life or death is discerned through them. Now, the scripture is transcribed for practical use.\n\nThe Dao says: Regularly press the small cavities behind both brows thrice nine times. With the palms and fingers, rub the area above both eyes, then rotate the ears thirty times—let the count be without fixed time. Upon completion, stroke the forehead counterflow thrice nine times, beginning at the midpoint of the brows and moving into the hairline. Swallow saliva, without limit to the amount. Practicing this constantly will sharpen ears and eyes; after two years, one may write by night. The small cavities behind the brows are the Mansion of the Upper Prime and Six Harmonies, governing the generation of eye radiance, harmonizing and refining essence and light, nurturing the pupils to clarity, and preserving the spirit of the eyes. This is the supreme method for the Perfected in sitting and rising, also called the \"Perfected of the Sun,\" ever abiding in the inner scripture. A true adage says: \"If you wish to write by night, constantly refine your daily practice.\" The reason the Perfected can observe all four directions and illuminate the eight distant realms is truly due to the clarity cultivated through this practice.\n\n**Method of the Green Ox Daoist for Visualizing Sun and Moon**\nThe oral formula of the Green Ox Daoist states: At dusk and dawn, visualize the sun above the forehead and the moon above the navel. This repels a thousand ghosts and ten thousand evils, summoning jade boys and jade maidens to descend and dispel myriad calamities—a profoundly efficacious secret.\n\nThe Green Ox Daoist was Feng Junyi.\n\n—Excerpted from *Records of Divine Immortals* and *Preface to the Five Peaks*\n\n**Oral Formula of Shen Yi**\nShen Yi’s oral formula states: When ingesting divine medicines, do not face north—this is a great taboo. On *hai* and *zi* days, one must not spit toward the north, lest essence be lost, qi depleted, and years of life diminished. The potency of medicine becomes as earth—deeply to be avoided.\n\n**Oral Formula of Le Ba**\nWhen traveling through mountains, wilderness, or passing by numinous shrines and malevolent spirit temples, visualize within the mouth a Perfected One named Red Numinous Venerable, attended by two jade maidens. One maiden is named Hua Zheng, the other She Jing. The Venerable wears a red silk robe, while the two maidens are clad in yellow above and below. Upon completing the visualization, sharply command: \"Ghosts and spirits of the shrine, hasten here! Let all malign forces report to the Red Numinous Venerable to be beheaded.\" The host of evils will flee a thousand leagues. This is the method of the Three Heavens’ vanguard for capturing ghosts.\n\n**Taboos and Methods for Ingesting Medicines and Treating Illness**\nThe oral formula of the wife of the female immortal Cheng Wei states: Do not consume bloody foods, for they prevent the expulsion of the Three Corpses and Two Drynesses—even dried meat is barely permissible.\n\n**Oral Formula of Feng Gang**\nFeng Gang’s oral formula states: When a Daoist falls ill, they should close their eyes and inwardly visualize, using the heart to generate fire to burn the body and the afflicted area. Visualize with precision, and like a topknot or beard, the illness will be cured. Focus on the painful area and intensify the fire—this is profoundly efficacious.\n\n—Excerpted from *Records of Divine Immortals*\n\n**Preface to Primordial Qi**",

      "translated_text": "The Perfected One states: Ingesting embryonic breathing and internal qi is the art of longevity. The *Yin Fu Jing* says, \"Without defense, life is not long.\" It also states: \"Winter grasses, when covered, remain unharmed.\" Thus, we know that the Way of nurturing life is none other than preserving primordial qi. This is why creatures that hibernate and burrow survive without eating—their breathing harmonizes with qi. Heaven generates the myriad things, yet humans are the most spiritually endowed. The hundred grains nourish them, and primordial qi sustains them. If one aligns their true nature with primordial qi, reduces thoughts and desires, relinquishes cunning, and detaches from the body, only then may they be shown the practices of bear-hanging and bird-stretching, tortoise-breathing and crane-dancing. These methods are not to be lightly shared, so I set forth their principles below.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Qi**\nWhen ingesting qi, first lie supine, close the mouth, and puff out the cheeks to fill the abdomen. When the mouth is full of qi, swallow it, contracting the throat to send it downward as if swallowing food. The throat has three passages: one for qi, which rises from the viscera to the mouth and slightly exits through the nose. When exhaling, contract to cut off the breath, then swallow. The swallow divides into two paths: the fluid enters the two kidneys, while the qi enters the intestines and stomach. If there is heat above and cold below, first ingest warm qi. If there is heat below and cold above, first ingest cool qi.\n\nWarm qi is drawn from the five viscera, held in the mouth until it becomes extremely hot, then swallowed. If the mouth is full of fluid and qi, contract and swallow—this is cool qi. It is also said that in autumn and winter, one should ingest warm qi, while in spring and summer, cool qi. Alternatively, one may assess the body’s own viscera and ingest qi accordingly.\n\nAt first, practice while lying supine; later, it may be done while walking, standing, sitting, or reclining. When puffing the cheeks, the teeth should be slightly parted; when swallowing, the teeth should be closed and touching. If they do not touch, the fluid and qi will not descend. After prolonged practice, the mouth may close naturally, and qi will effortlessly enter the intestines and stomach without strain. If the method is incorrect, primordial qi will not descend, and what feels like swallowing will only be a small amount of fluid.\n\nWhen contracting the qi, the teeth must touch without parting. If the mouth opens, the qi will escape through the nose, rendering the swallow ineffective. Precision is essential.\n\n**Timing for Ingesting Qi**\nIngest qi at the fifth watch, when food is fully digested, and continue until mealtime to forget hunger. Once proficient, if hunger arises, ingest qi. The abdomen may gurgle; if qi flows continuously, it will not. If the abdomen is empty when qi enters, gurgling is harmless. Once proficient, one may choose to abstain from food entirely or eat as desired.\n\n**Ingesting the Essence of Sun and Moon**\nTo ingest the essence of the sun and moon, do so at dawn or midnight, when vital qi is born, and only when the sky is clear. For internal qi, ingest whenever the abdomen feels empty, regardless of time or posture, and without limit on frequency.\n\nDuring the first seven days of ingesting qi, one may experience two or three bouts of diarrhea, with or without mucus, and reddish urine—this is not cause for alarm. Initially, one may feel stifling discomfort below the navel, which should not be doubted. At such times, light a lamp and incense in a quiet room, avoid distractions, loosen clothing, and lie supine with the limbs relaxed. Briefly hold the breath and visualize qi emerging from the five viscera, descending to the two kidneys, and pressing against the spine, where two white qi pathways rise along either side of the spine to the head. Visualize the qi reaching the hair, lingering brightly for a long while, then descending to the face, entering the five viscera, and continuing down to the Three Stars (the pubic region). From there, guide it to the Yongquan points in the soles of the feet. Then, rub the abdomen with both palms twenty to thirty times, and below the navel a hundred times. Relax the four limbs for a moment, and natural comfort will dispel all prior discomfort.\n\nIn my youth, Master Dongwei transmitted these secrets to me. Through diligent practice and self-regulation, I found them invariably effective. Using the hands is less effective than using the mind, for when mind and qi unite, the mind’s intent is met with qi’s response. In my early years, I suffered from various ailments—dripping sickness, emaciation, and consumptive symptoms—but through qi techniques, I recovered entirely. In the first seven days, minor changes may occur, as described earlier. After ten days of diligent practice, natural circulation is restored, and stability follows. One should occasionally ingest qi once or twice to maintain continuity; if a lapse occurs, resume practice. Excessive ingestion may cause belching or flatulence, which is not unusual.\n\nAfter seven or fourteen days of ingesting qi, one may eat food or drink wine without harm, though wine should not be consumed to excess, lest it disrupt true qi. Do not ingest qi on a full stomach; wait until digestion is complete. Those who do not understand qi ingestion but only practice visualization or use herbs to abstain from grains cannot sustain it for long. After hunger and thirst, sudden eating may lead to death, for the intestines and stomach become dry and brittle, and the nine orifices block, resulting in fatality. For those who ingest qi, eating is not harmful because their intestines and stomach remain open and receptive. When thirsty, drink broth or water, using fluids to moisten the body. Collect fluids by pressing the tongue against the upper palate and rolling it beneath and to the sides, gathering saliva.\n\nThose who ingest qi must first relinquish worldly attachments, aligning the heart with the Dao, and only then practice. Illnesses will then be easily cured. If the four limbs feel unbalanced, visualize the afflicted area and attack it with qi to heal. After attaining the Dao, one will be forever free of illness, feeling daily more light and vigorous, capable of long journeys. Even when passing through foul or pungent places, though uncomfortable, no harm will come. Sitting in seclusion, burning incense, and maintaining purity while avoiding external impurities is especially beneficial.\n\nIf one uses qi to abstain from grains but still craves food, this indicates a divided mind and hesitation. If one resolutely relies solely on primordial qi, over time, even the sight of food will not arouse desire.",
      "overlap_context": "esses—even dried meat is barely permissible.\n\n**Oral Formula of Feng Gang**\nFeng Gang’s oral formula states: When a Daoist falls ill, they should close their eyes and inwardly visualize, using the heart to generate fire to burn the body and the afflicted area. Visualize with precision, and like a topknot or beard, the illness will be cured. Focus on the painful area and intensify the fire—this is profoundly efficacious.\n\n—Excerpted from *Records of Divine Immortals*\n\n**Preface to Primordial Qi**",

      "translated_text": "When the Dao of qi-ingestion is mastered, it surpasses both medicinal treatment and grain abstention. Though the body may initially feel weak, the practice of qi-ingestion is most wondrous. Over time, even wine and broths become unnecessary, and both urination and defecation cease entirely. If a dedicated practitioner has official duties and cannot focus solely on the Dao, they may ingest the harmonious primordial qi during spare moments—thirty to fifty swallows every one or two hours—ensuring that the qi-sea in the abdomen always contains primordial qi. Should illness arise, use daoyin techniques to guide the qi outward and attack the affliction, yielding immediate and verifiable results.\n\nThough one ingests internal qi, external qi is also essential. External qi refers to the essence of the sun and moon. At dawn, within one’s chamber, one ingests the blue-green qi. As the *Huangting Jing* states, \"The light of the sun and moon rescues the aged and infirm\"—this is its meaning. For those ingesting primordial qi, there is no fixed time; one may practice at any moment, ingesting whenever possible. As for the essence of the sun and moon, wait for clear and mild weather, when the sun has risen a *zhang* or more above the horizon, and then ingest. Face the sun, cup the hands in four bows, close the eyes, and visualize a beam of purple radiance from the sun entering the nose and mouth. Imagine the mouth filled with crimson light, then swallow twenty-seven times before stopping. Bow four more times. Relying solely on internal qi is inadequate; one must also ingest *shengqi* (vital qi), which is this very essence. Once *shengqi* is ingested, it unites with primordial qi, hastening the cure of illnesses. If only internal qi is used, healing will be slower. With prolonged ingestion of the sun and moon’s essence, the body becomes spiritually attuned and radiant.\n\nTo attack illness with breath-holding, the method is swift and effective. In a quiet chamber, lie down properly. If fragrant incense is available, burn it; if not, it is still acceptable. Loosen clothing and belts, relax the body, make fists, and slowly exhale fully two or three times. Inhale through the nose, then seal the mouth tightly. Focus the mind on the afflicted area, continuously directing qi to it until ten breaths are completed. Begin again from one, repeating this ten times for a total of one hundred. If the body feels stiff or weak, close the eyes, exhale gently, and rest for five breaths before rising. When attacking illness with breath-holding, the body should grow intensely hot, with sweat flowing freely—this indicates full recovery. Then, release the qi to circulate freely, opening the joints, limbs, and pores, allowing the qi to escape like mist or steam rising from rice. With time, this will become apparent. If the head is afflicted, pinch the nostrils shut and attack with qi to heal. Many know of ingesting internal primordial qi but are unaware of *shengqi*—the essence of the sun and moon and the blue-green qi of dawn. Primordial qi resides in the spleen, relying on *shengqi* to sustain it.\n\n**Daoyin Method**\nWhen the body feels sluggish or obstructed, perform the nineteen daoyin techniques:\n\n1. Rub the hands together as if washing them.\n2. Interlace the fingers loosely, then turn and press them toward the chest.\n3. Clasp the hands and press them together against the abdomen, alternating left and right.\n4. Interlace the fingers tightly, press them against the abdomen, and slowly stretch the body, alternating left and right.\n5. Mimic drawing a heavy bow, alternating left and right.\n6. Make fists and thrust them forward, alternating left and right.\n7. Mimic lifting a thousand-pound stone, alternating left and right.\n8. Withdraw the fists sharply—this is called \"opening the chest,\" alternating left and right.\n9. Sit upright, lean to one side as if pushing a mountain, alternating left and right.\n10. Clasp the head and rotate it over the top—this is called \"opening the ribs,\" alternating left and right.\n11. Place the hands on the ground, arch the back, and lift the body three times.\n12. Strike the back with the hands, alternating left and right.\n13. Sit upright, extend the legs, interlace the fingers, and pull backward.\n14. Place the hands on the ground and turn the head to gaze left and right—this is called \"tiger gaze.\"\n15. Stand and bend backward, lifting the body three times.\n16. Clasp the hands tightly, place a foot on them, and sway left and right, alternating feet.\n17. Stand and step forward and backward, alternating left and right.\n18. Sit upright, extend the legs toward the heart, hook the feet with the hands, place them on the knees, and press left and right.\n19. Raise the hands straight up to point at the sky, then lower them straight down to point at the earth, alternating left and right.\n\nPracticing these nineteen postures daily strengthens and prolongs life, preventing illness. If unable to perform all, choose one or two preferred techniques and practice them regularly to ensure smooth circulation of blood and qi. When performing daoyin, avoid drafts and hold the breath. After each session, exhale the stale qi without letting the ears hear it.\n\n**Observing the Four Great Elements**\nThe Four Great Elements, when harmonized, sustain life; when disharmonized, they cause illness. Observe the lips and mouth to assess their state: cold indicates an excess of wind, heat an excess of fire, dryness an excess of earth, and slipperiness an excess of water. Sound indicates wind excess, movement indicates panting excess, itching indicates qi excess, while silence and absence of panting indicate harmony. Illness may arise externally or internally. External causes include cold, heat, fatigue, idleness, satiety, hunger, and deficiency; internal causes include fame, profit, joy, anger, sound, color, thought, and scheming. Exhale through the mouth and inhale through the nose, neither hurried nor slow, naturally and gently. There are six types of exhalation, each treating different conditions:\n\n- For cold, exhale with *chui*.\n- For heat, exhale with *he*.\n- For wind pain, exhale with *xi*.\n- For rising qi, exhale with *hu*.\n- For phlegm and fullness, exhale with *xu*.\n- For heat, fatigue, and weariness, exhale with *si*.\n\nWhen the heart’s storehouse is afflicted, if cold, exhale with *chui*; if hot, exhale with *hu*. At night, if one dreams of a red-clad figure wielding a blade, staff, or fire to frighten, this signals disharmony.",

      "translated_text": "To perform healing with prohibitions, first ensure the patient’s household selects a day of clear and harmonious weather, thoroughly cleanses the chamber, and maintains absolute quietude. When the Daoist arrives at the patient’s side, they must burn incense and carefully observe the patient’s spirit and qi. If the physical signs are dire and beyond treatment, one must still perform the method of preserving spirit and circulating qi, applying the seal thrice. At midday, return to observe whether the spirit and qi have subtly shifted toward improvement. If not, apply the prohibition once more. Inquire again at night to see if any change has occurred; if none, apply the prohibition once more. At dawn the following day, if the patient’s spirit and complexion remain unchanged, their life is exhausted, and they cannot be cured.\n\nIn treating illness, one must first value restraint in material gain. The Dao possesses a heart of deliverance, and the divine spirits will surely protect; the true qi will assuredly respond. If one’s actions are motivated by desire for wealth, lacking a heart of deliverance, all efforts will be ineffectual, and misfortune will instead afflict the practitioner. The Daoist methods of talismanic prohibitions are meant to relieve human suffering. It is essential to frequently invite Daoists to expound upon the thirty-six revered scriptures, elucidating the mysterious and sagely techniques of talismans and prohibitions. One should also, according to their capacity, study and practice the subtle arts. Now, in strict accordance with the secret methods of the *Zhengyi Divine Immortals’ Three-Five*, the techniques of talismanic prohibitions are set forth as follows:\n\nThe grand assemblies of the twelve celestial stems and the Three-Five reveal the hidden and the unseen. The methods of prohibition are among the Daoist arts of warding and defense, profound and manifold, with myriad streams flowing from a deep wellspring—difficult to master in their entirety. Yet when saving lives in peril, nothing precedes the seal. In ancient times, Fan Li employed it to cause mountains to crumble and rivers to halt their flow; the awe of its divine power stilled the thunder’s roar. It can melt metal and polish jade, restore qi, and revive the soul—how much more so for healing illness?\n\nYet ordinary people, shallow and obscured in the mysteries of defense, find it hard to attain mastery. Many practitioners today achieve no effect, largely due to insufficient study or a lack of single-minded devotion. As Li Daohua said: “I do not claim ignorance, for I have practiced this method since youth. The seal’s obscurity lies in the art of visualization. If one can refine their breath and clarify its measures, then visualization becomes lucid, and the divine spirits are fully present.”\n\nThus, don the cap and sash of the Five Spirits, and step the *Qianyuan* hexagram’s *heng li zhen*. Those who can achieve this will rarely fail to cure. Here, I briefly sketch the sequence with my limited understanding to share with fellow learners, though I have not yet fully grasped its essential subtleties.",

      "translated_text": "The Sevenfold Qi-Mobilizing Method begins with purifying through water-spraying. Hold the water bowl in the left hand and the sword in the right, directing sword and water toward one another. Stand with your back to *jian* (建) and face *po* (破), visualizing before you a true official in vermilion robes, nineteen feet tall, wearing a nine-phoenix crown from the Registers. Take the water into your mouth and spray it toward the patient, the chamber ablaze as if with morning radiance. Then, with sword and water still aligned, envision the Dipper’s seven stars above your head, mirrored in the water bowl. Solemnly invoke the essence of the Northern Dipper’s seven stars to descend into this water, commanding: “All ghosts of the hundred infestations, flee ten thousand leagues! Those who disobey shall be slain and delivered to the White Youth of the West. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!”\n\nSpray in each of the five directions, then spray the patient. Step one *zhang* away from the patient, form the *dūjiān* mudra with the left hand, and hold the seal in the right, standing upright before the sovereign. First, visualize your own spirit: head crowned by heaven, feet planted on earth, your body enveloped in five-colored cloud-qi. Second, envision the Five Stars above your head, each in its proper quadrant, one *chi* from your crown. Third, visualize before your face the sun to the left and the moon to the right, nine *cun* distant. Fourth, envision above your head the Vermilion Bird, the Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right, and beneath your feet the Eight Trigrams, with the divine tortoise moving the seal, jade lads and jade maidens attending at your sides. Fifth, visualize five-colored true qi, thick as silk threads, issuing from the five viscera through your mouth, rising one *zhang* and eight *chi* above your head, then coiling threefold around it.\n\nNext, visualize three figures in green robes with green sashes emerging from the liver to stand at the left; three in red robes with red sashes emerging from the heart to stand before you; three in white robes with white sashes emerging from the lungs to stand at the right; three in black robes with black sashes emerging from the kidneys to stand behind; and three in yellow robes with yellow sashes emerging from the spleen to stand in the *bǐng* direction, each holding a sword in the left hand and an iron axe in the right. Then envision the seven stars of the Dipper crowning your head, their rays pointing to the patient’s afflicted area. Next, recall the true official in the nine-phoenix crown, riding the red qi of the sun, performing the *Yǔ* step while wielding the seal. Seal the patient’s heart once, the abdomen once, and the afflicted area once, imagining the poisonous qi scattering and dispersing.\n\nThen, holding your breath to the utmost, perform the *Yǔ* step along the nine paths to where the patient stands. Before sealing, inhale from the patient’s mouth three times, swallowing thrice and shouting thrice. Strike the celestial bell six times, sound the celestial chime six times—bells for summoning, chimes for subduing. Then recite the seal’s incantation:\n\n“The divine seal of the Heavenly Thearch:\nSeals mountains into lakes,\nSeals stones into roads,\nSeals trees to wither,\nSeals earth to split,\nSeals wood to break,\nSeals fire to extinguish,\nSeals water to cease,\nSeals above to penetrate below,\nSeals exterior to penetrate interior,\nSeals front to penetrate rear,\nSeals left to penetrate right,\nSeals evil to vanish,\nSeals pain to cease,\nSeals illness to disperse,\nSeals ghosts to flee.\nBreak and remove obstructions,\nDissolve misfortune and calamity.\nHasten, depart of your own accord!\nLet the proper spirits settle in their places.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Most High Lord Lao’s statutes and ordinances.”\n\nPress the seal while holding your breath for a long moment, then lift it and step back. Recite further:\n\n“[Name], male/female, born in the year [X], on the [day] of the [month] at the [hour], now suffers from [illness]. I humbly invoke the Three Departments’ Great Generals—the Seal-Wielding General, the Illness-Treating General, the Evil-Destroying General, and the Demon-Quelling General—to accompany the seal in curing the affliction within [Name]’s body. Hasten, depart with a shout!”\n\nThen, with the Yellow Spirit’s *Yuèzhāng* seal, seal the heart so the illness issues from the heart, seal the abdomen so it issues from the abdomen, seal the liver so it issues from the liver, seal the lungs so it issues from the lungs, seal the kidneys so it issues from the kidneys, seal the spleen so it issues from the spleen, seal the head so it issues from the head, seal the back so it issues from the back, seal the chest so it issues from the chest, seal the waist so it issues from the waist, seal the hands so it issues from the hands, seal the feet so it issues from the feet. “Depart swiftly, depart swiftly! Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by ordinance!”\n\nAfter pressing the seal, recite the incantation once more, then lift it. Hold the seal before your heart and recite:\n\n“Ghosts of the south, ghosts of the north, ghosts of the east, ghosts of the west, ghosts of the center, celestial ghosts, terrestrial ghosts, divine ghosts, male ghosts, female ghosts, ghosts of sunken corpses and poisonous infestations—those sealed shall die, those encountered shall perish! Depart swiftly, depart swiftly!”\n\nPress the seal and recite the incantation twice more, then lift it. Have the patient swallow two or three talismans—three for men, two for women.\n\nIn performing these prohibitions and treatments, one must visualize the true qi of the ten directions. Before enacting the prohibition, instruct the patient to abstain for three days from the five pungent foods, the twelve zodiacal meats, and all crab, fish, wine, and other foul or raw substances, permitting only a small amount of dried venison. Only then may the seal be applied; otherwise, it will harm rather than benefit. After using the seal, bathe it in fragrant water, dry it with new silk, and store it in its case.\n\nThis seal must not be brought into houses of mourning, households with postpartum women, or places tainted by blood, the six livestock, afterbirth, or filth. If, in the night, one is startled from sleep by strange sounds or disturbances, rise at once and cry aloud: “The seven spirits of the household and the Controller of Destiny, honored lords, why do these unruly ghosts dare offend the descendants of the Yellow Thearch? Seize and imprison them, delivering them to the wardens for punishment!” Then hang the seal on the door and step outside briefly—you will soon hear the sound of flogging.\n\nIf a person suddenly falls prey to malign corpse-ghost afflictions or faints without cease, seal the heart to halt it immediately. If a person cannot stop speaking with ghosts, seal them according to the method, and it will cease. If, while traveling on roads, entering mountains or wilds, or crossing rivers and lakes, one encounters wolves, tigers, bears, or other creatures harming people or livestock, seal their tracks—the tiger will flee thirty *li* and stop. If the seal is inverted, the creature will rush toward the person. For water-dwelling creatures like dragons, fish, turtles, insects, or venomous snakes harming people, mix yellow earth into mud, seal it, and cast it into the water—they will die. If servants or maids flee, seal their tracks, and they will return. If a person is suddenly struck by malign qi, or falls dead without apparent cause, or feels as if stabbed by awls or knives in the limbs or body, hold your breath, press the seal on the painful spot or the heart, and recite: “Evil qi depart, proper qi remain!”",
