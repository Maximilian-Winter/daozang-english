They are constantly afflicted by disasters of flood, fire, blades, weapons, and illness. When they come to enter the Dharma-gate, what merits should they cultivate to attain peace and happiness, long and distant years, and natural abundance of clothing and food? I humbly beseech your compassion to broadly bestow deliverance.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy replied: \"Excellent! Divine King, you are able to reveal the essentials of the Dao for the sake of sentient beings. From this day forward, if there are sentient beings who take refuge in and believe in the Supreme Great Dao, moved by the grace of transformation to enter the Dharma-gate, first let them practice equality, blunt their sharpness, and resolve their conflicts. They should cultivate the Threefold Purity: first, purity of body; second, purity of mind; and third, purity of speech.\n\nWhen the Three Karmas are pure, then they may be entrusted with the supreme methods of the Three Caverns, which will endure without cease for eternal kalpas. They will constantly dwell in the heavens, the Five Blessings will long gather, and the hundred spirits will protect them.\n\nIf they encounter the Three Primes, the Five La Festivals, the Eight Nodal Days, the Four Seasons, or their own birthdays, let them burn the finest incense in a pure hall, kneel facing east, make obeisance, click their teeth, swallow their saliva, and recite the Incantation for Prolonging Life and Extending Longevity:\n\n*Mysterious, wondrous, the True One’s body,*\n*Expounding the scriptures of the Nine Heavens’ texts.*\n*Soaring through the Great Luo’s realm,*\n*At the Golden Terrace, they pay homage to the August One.*\n*Longevity has no root of suffering,*\n*Years and ages depend on the flourishing camphor.*\n*The hundred bones radiate jade-like light,*\n*Reverently thanking the White Prime Lord.*\n\nAfter reciting, let them click their teeth three times, swallow their saliva three times, close their eyes to visualize their body, and sit upright within the five-colored light. Then let them recite the Incantation for Gathering Blessings:\n\n*Inscribed by the Jade Terrace youths,*\n*The numinous immortals guard their gate.*\n*Blessings and virtue renew with the sun,*\n*Their body’s light shines through the Three Heavens.*\n*Purple canopies spread over a thousand palaces,*\n*Their minds return to the Supreme Worthy.*\n*The Five Blessings stretch endlessly,*\n*Secretly protecting those within the Mystery.*\n\nThe Celestial Worthy said: \"If there are those who practice and uphold this scripture with resolve and mindfulness, their spirit and soul will be thoroughly illuminated, external demons and devils will disperse, blessings and virtue will accumulate daily, their bodies will merge with spontaneity, and they will radiate light. They will forever return to the true Dao and enjoy peace and happiness in life after life.\"\n\nAt that time, the Divine King of Blessing Protection, having heard the Celestial Worthy expound these vast and great blessings, concentrated his mind in sincere faith.
