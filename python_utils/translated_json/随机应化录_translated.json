  "full_translation": "**Record of Spontaneous Transformation in Accordance with Circumstances**\n\n**Title:** *Record of Spontaneous Transformation in Accordance with Circumstances*\nComposed by **Master He Daoquan** (the Pure One), compiled by his disciple **Jia Daoxuan**. Two volumes.\nSource text: *Canonical Daoist Canon (Zhengtong Daozang)*, **Taixuan (Great Mystery) Section**.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Record of Spontaneous Transformation in Accordance with Circumstances* by the Pure One**\nThere was a **Quanzhen Daoist** of the Shaanxi region, whose ancestral home was in **Zhejiang’s Simin** (Four Mings). His father resided in **Qiantang**, where **Master He Daoquan** was born. From his youth, the Master cultivated the Dao, taking the name **Wugouzi** (the Unstained One), and wandered the lands by the **East Sea**. Few took note of him at the time. Later, he journeyed westward to **Zhongnan Mountain**, dwelling in the ruins of **Guifeng Peak**, where his cultivation reached fulfillment. The people marveled at this, and it is recorded in inscriptions.\n\nIn the **Mengcheng** month of the **Jisi year of Hongwu** (1379), the Master passed away in a **Long’an medical hall**. Noble officials bestowed upon him the rites of **ascension**, and he was interred in the **graveyard of the Immortals**.\n\nTwo years later, **Sun Shoutongzi** (Master Sun, the Longevity Communicator) arrived, speaking thus: *\"I had long known Master He, but now he has departed—there is no longer any hope of seeing him again.\"* Alas, how lofty was Master He’s spirit! He bowed respectfully and entreated me, *\"I beg you to compose a preface for this work.\"*\n\nI sighed and replied: *\"The Dao cannot be made manifest through mere description; one must record its true practice. Though my learning is meager, I shall strive to express it in words.\"* Indeed, in both past and present, those who aspire to the Dao often fail to grasp its ultimate essence. Yet Master He penetrated the principles of **nature and fate**, embodying the teaching of **non-action**, so that even common folk revered his transformation. How could this be, unless his innate purity was profound?\n\n**Jia Daoxuan** was Master He’s disciple. Carrying medicine, he traveled a thousand miles without fatigue, determined to complete this record. Without Master Sun’s request, I would not have undertaken this work. Yet Master Sun’s Dao is now manifest, and Master He’s Dao is also manifest—like matching seals. Since Master He’s passing, without Master Sun, the **orthodox teaching** would have no one to transmit it. Though Master Sun was younger, he revered Master He, and now, after his departure, he further illuminates his legacy. This alone reveals Master He’s **virtue**.\n\nTheir bond was profound. The compilation of this **language record** was Master He’s own work, completed before his death, and it holds great significance for the teaching. This was written on the **sixth day of the sixth month, Xinyi year of Hongwu** (1381), by **Kunqiu Lingtongzi** (the Responsive Sage of Kunqiu).\n\n---\n**Volume One of the *Record of Spontaneous Transformation in Accordance with Circumstances***\nNarrated by **Master He Daoquan, the Pure One of Songxi**\nCompiled by his disciple **Jia Daoxuan**.\n\n**The Way Manifests**\n\nMaster [He Daoquan] journeyed away from Zhe, wandering through Huai and Chu, arriving at the True Martial Hall by the Red Lotus Lake in Muyang. There, he encountered an old Daoist friend reclining in high spirits, who exclaimed, *\"The Pure One of Songxi has come to visit—let us mix the clay with the disciples!\"*\n\nThe old friend, Gao, laughed, *\"These past few years, the Pure One has been dragging himself through mud and water.\"*\n\nMaster replied, *\"He knows only that lotus roots grow in the mud, but does not see that lotus flowers bloom when they rise above the water.\"*\n\nGao asked, *\"What relation does the lotus root bear to the lotus flower? How can their forms be compared?\"*\n\nMaster answered, *\"The lotus root symbolizes the human body. The lotus flower represents the true nature of the heart. A Daoist and a common person may respond to affairs in the same way, but it is in the mind’s essence that they differ. Thus, I composed a verse:*\n\n*'The void itself sets no dust in motion,\nOuter forms are false, yet the core is true.\nOnly the lotus root knows how to thrive in stagnant mud,\nNever has it seen the lotus flower’s fresh emergence from the water.'*\n\nMaster then traveled westward, crossing the Yellow River, and reached the humble hermitage of Master Zhan. While conversing with an aged monk, a novice arrived to listen to the teachings.\n\nThe aged monk said, *\"There is no law to expound.\"*\n\nMaster replied, *\"This is the true expounding of the Way! Have you not heard the *Diamond Sutra* say: ‘Without law to expound, this is called expounding the law’?\"*\n\nThe Confucian scholar remarked, *\"Though the Way transcends the senses of hearing and sight, one cannot truly escape their use.\"*\n\nLong ago, when **Subhuti** reclined in meditation among the cliffs, the heavenly hosts showered him with flowers, saying, *\"We see the Honorable One skillfully expounding Prajna [Wisdom].\"*\n\nThe Honorable One replied, *\"I have never uttered a single word about Prajna.\"*\n\nThe heavenly hosts said, *\"If the Honorable One does not speak, then we have not heard either. Without speech and without hearing, this is the true Prajna.\"*\n\nThe *Thunder Ancestor Sutra* states: *\"If you wish to hear the supreme Way, the supreme Way is profound and distant—it lies not in other things. Since you desire to hear it, then ‘without hearing’ is the Way itself.\"*\n\nThose who study the Way must be sincere and gentle, keeping silent and guarding themselves, only then can they enter the Way.\n\nThe novice further inquired about the meaning of *‘middle.’*\n\nMaster said, *\"Wherever thoughts arise, that is the middle—this is the Daoist understanding of ‘middle.’\"*\n\nThe Buddhist [monk] explained, *\"Neither clinging to good nor to evil—when the mind is just and clear, that is your original face, this is the Buddhist understanding of ‘middle.’\"*\n\nThe Confucian scholar said, *\"The state before the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight manifest is called ‘middle’—this is the Confucian understanding of ‘middle.’ You should ponder this.\"*\n\nMaster arrived at the Ning An hermitage in **Pingning**, where **Zhang An** was the primary attendant seeking his guidance.\n\nThe novice asked, *\"Between the peach pit and the peach tree, which came first?\"*\n\nMaster replied, *\"You only see gardens with flowers blooming in full array,\nyet do not know all owe their growth to the **yang and** force of **the sun’s qi (阳和力)**.\nIt is but a single **true qi (一炁分真)**,\ntransformed and manifesting as such.\"*\n\nAt the **beginning of the Great Ultimate (太极初判)**,\nthe formless can generate the myriad forms,\nthe shapeless can govern the shaped—\nthis is what is called the **Emperor of Forms (象帝)** before their appearance.\n\nThe hermitage attendant further asked, *\"Between the chicken egg and the hen, which came first?\"*\n\nMaster said, *\"These are all of one principle (一理).\"*\n\nThe attendant asked, *\"Yet some eggs do not hatch into birds—why is that?\"*\n\nMaster replied, *\"Consider the peach pit,\nhanging in empty space without rooting in earth—\nhow could it sprout and grow into a tree?\"*\n\nThe *Sutra of the Beginning of Writing (文始经)* states:\n*\"All seeds within the soil,\nby the transformative power of heaven and earth, sprout into life.\nThe sprouts grow into trees,\nthe trees then blossom with flowers,\nthe flowers wither into fruit,\nthe fruit ripens into seeds,\nthe seeds return to sprouts,\nthe sprouts return to trees—\nseeds and sprouts mutually generating,\ntheir changes extending countless billions of trees,\nendless without end.*\n\n*If a seed hangs suspended in the void,\nuntouched by any boundary or side,\nnot dwelling within the earth,\nthough heaven and earth be vast,\nthey cannot transform the seed in emptiness\nto sprout and grow into a tree.*\n\n*Moreover, when yin and yang unite,\nthe transformative power of heaven and earth produces birds,\nthe birds then lay eggs,\nthe eggs and birds mutually generating—\ntheir changes extending countless billions of birds,\nendless without end.*\n\n*If an egg lacks the yang (雄),\nthough yin and yang be wondrous,\nthey cannot transform it—\nthis is pure yin without yang.*\n\n*As the ancients said:\nPure yang unmixed becomes a **xian (仙)**,\nyin and yang harmonized create all things,\npure yin without yang becomes a **gui (鬼)**.*\n\n*Emperor Yin (尹真君)* declared:\n*\"Those who have not yet harmed me,\nI subdue with a single breath—\nthen they transform into all things.\nAmong the Five Phases (五行),\nwho can resist my transformation?\"*\n\n*For those who cultivate the Way,\nwhen encountering phenomena,\nthey must pass through lightly and swiftly—\nall afflictions must not be clung to or suppressed.\nIf they are bound by myriad things,\nand cling to objects, they will be transformed by them,\nensnared by yin and yang,\ntheir thoughts shifting with each circumstance—\nthus they fall into the cycle of rebirth and wanderings in samsara.*\n\n*If even a thread of thought arises,\nthey must immediately subdue it.\nIf they can extinguish thoughts and forget emotions,\nall afflictions will cease,\nand yin and yang will no longer forge them.*\n\n*Like a seed suspended in the void,\nan egg without yang,\noutside the Six Coalescences (六合之内),\nreturning to the primordial origin—\nthis is no small matter.*\n\nMaster then arrived at the **Youde Temple (佑德观)** in **Nazhou (那州)**,\nwhere **Master Xiuju (秀聚峰)** sought his guidance.\n\nThe monk asked about the phrase *\"reciting the Buddha (念佛).\"*\n\nMaster said, *\"Why seek so far?\nHow could you not recognize your own Buddha?\"*\n\n*\"If you were to invite the Western Buddha to come,\nwhere would you place your own family’s Buddha?\"*\n\n*\"Have you not heard the Old One of the River say:\nIf you claim he is the Buddha,\nyou yourself become a demon (魔).\"*\n\n*The Daoists say:\nWithin your body lies the true **Primordial Origin (真元始)**,\nwhy seek the **Celestial Sovereign (天尊)** outside your mind?\"*\n\n*The Confucians say:\nMy body itself contains a **Great Ultimate (太极).\"***\n\nThe monk further asked, *\"Please, Master, reveal the swift path of reciting the Buddha—\nhow can one attain the Buddha’s true face?\"*\n\nMaster laughed and said, *\"I tell you:\nThe ancients said,\n‘Recite the Buddha once, respond once—\nthe original face is made utterly clear.\nWithout the mind, a staff strikes the peach pit—\nit startles even the encased spirit within.’*\n\n*This is breaking open the Buddha’s true face.*\n\n*Moreover, the path of reciting the Buddha has three levels:\nFirst, subduing demons;\nsecond, visualization;\nthird, inquiry and investigation.*\n\n*None of these three stages depend on counting the beads of recitation.*\n\n*For those who first begin reciting the Buddha,\nthey must first recite the Buddha to subdue demons.\nWhen the demons are suppressed and thoughts extinguished,\nonly then do they enter the path.*\n\n*If not so,\nthey waste their **spirit and qi (神气)**,\nand will never succeed.*\n\n*What is crucial is subduing demons and extinguishing thoughts—\nwhen reciting the Buddha,\ndo not let even a thread of thought arise.\nTreat all stray thoughts as the true object,\nand strive to replace your dull heart with the Buddha’s heart.*\n\n*If your foundation is shallow,\nand you cannot swiftly replace it,\nthen reflect within yourself:\n‘I am one who recites the Buddha—\nwhy do these thoughts arise?\nThey are the roots of my past karma.’*\n\n*Thus, holding yourself in restraint,\ngradually raise the Buddha’s name,\nfrom one to ten voices,\nor even to a hundred.\nDo not let stray thoughts interrupt—\nif thoughts arise, sweep them away;\nif no thoughts arise, raise the recitation.*\n\n*The former Master said:\n‘Thoughts within no-thoughts,\nno-thoughts within thoughts—\nthis is the way.’*\n\n*With time and practice,\na natural understanding will emerge.\nSimply recite the Buddha in all your movements and stillness,\nnever ceasing.*\n\n*If your thoughts do not stray,\nand you never forget the recitation,\nuntil it reaches the point where you do not raise it yet it is raised,\nno-thoughts yet thoughts arise—\nthen you have attained its power.*\n\n*Thus, reciting the Buddha,\nyou will later bear good fruit.*\n*If evil thoughts are many,\nand your mouth recites while your heart does not—\nthis is creating karma,\nknown as the **‘Buddha’s mouth, serpent’s heart (佛口蛇心).’***\n\n*For those who practice reciting the Buddha through visualization,*\n*in all your movements and stillness,\nspeech and silence,*\n*visualize the Buddha at every moment—\nthis is not done aloud.*\n\n*The Buddha does not leave your heart,\nyour heart does not leave the Buddha—\nlike mother and child remembering each other.*\n\n*If even a fleeting thought of phenomena arises,\nimmediately gather the scene into your heart\nand use it as your visualization.*\n\n*Within your own heart is a single true Buddha,\nwith a purple flame and golden form,\nseated in majesty—\ntowering and unmoving.*\n\n*Never abandon this moment,\nvisualize and recite at every thought—\nwhether in thousands or hundreds of recitations,*\n*the Buddha appears before you.*\n\n*When facing adverse or favorable circumstances,\nor demonic obstacles,*\n*sweep them all away with one mind,\nvisualizing and reciting the Buddha:*\n*Amitābha Buddha (阿弥陀佛) is the sovereign master—\nlike leaning on Mount Sumeru,*\n*or clutching a pillar in a rushing torrent,*\n*never letting go.*\n*The demons will scatter,\nthe evils will turn right.*\n\n*Even at the time of your hundred-year lifespan’s end,*\n*do thus—*\n*with one mind, take the Buddha as your master,*\n*your thoughts never straying,*\n*you will naturally not follow the evil path.*\n\n*If you recite the Buddha while alive,*\n*and never forget it for an instant,*\n*you will eventually find your way in.\"*\n\nAt once, grasp and press tightly—\nrealize your own Amitābha,\naccomplishing tenfold what a hundred would.\n\nThis manner of reciting the Buddha—\none voice surpasses a thousand or hundred.\nGuilt vanishes, the Dao grows long—\nthen your original nature awakens of itself.\n\nFor those who delve into reciting the Buddha,\nchoose a quiet place,\nregulate food and drink,\nthicken your mat and cushions,\nwear loose robes and sit in the lotus posture,\nstraighten your spine and adjust your *qi*,\nbanish all stray thoughts,\nthen gently raise the Buddha’s name.\n\nNot aloud—\nsilently recite from one to a hundred voices.\nIf stray thoughts arise, restart from the beginning,\nuntil a hundred voices flow without interruption.\n\nVoice by voice, ponder its meaning:\nWho is it that recites the Buddha?\nAt the dissolution of the four elements,\nwhere does the one who recites the Buddha take refuge—\nwhere does he stand firm and find his home?\nPonder and recite, never letting go.\nIn all actions—walking, standing, sitting, lying—\npractice and recite without forgetting,\nexhausting the branches, probing the roots,\nseeking absolute clarity.\n\nUntil pondering becomes self-pondering,\nraising the name becomes self-raising.\nWith time and depth,\nsuddenly feeling your own nostrils,\nrecognizing Amitābha Buddha.\n\nAt that moment, one voice\ncrosses to the other shore—\nbetter than reciting a thousand million billion Buddha names,\nbetter than counting beads until your *qi* is exhausted.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Do not seek the Buddha far off on Spirit Mountain—\nSpirit Mountain is within your own heart.\nEach person has a Spirit Mountain stupa—\ngo and cultivate beneath it.\"*\n\nThus composed a verse:\n*\"In the West, a Buddha named Amitābha,\nHidden in the heart, unknown to all.\nIf you recite without other thoughts,\nHellfire turns to a lotus pool.\"*\n\nThe Master arrived in Pizhou.\nA virtuous layman, Su Deshan, sought the Master,\nasking about the phrase *\"nurturing the heart.\"*\nThe Master said:\n*\"To nurture the heart,\nyou must remove defilement and still the thoughts.\nWhen thoughts cease, defilement is removed—\nthe heart becomes naturally pure.\"*\n\nHe asked again about *\"nurturing qi.\"*\nThe Master said:\n*\"Sparse speech nurtures *qi*.\"*\n\nHe asked again about *\"uniting the head.\"*\nThe Master said:\n*\"Uniting is gathering—\nto urge all beings to do good and accumulate merit,\nand in that assembly, you are the honored one.\nSpeaking inwardly,\nnurturing spirit and refining *qi*,\nharmonizing yin and yang,\nbalancing the four seasons,\nconcentrating the five phases,\npiercing the three passports to ascend to the Celestial Valley,\ngathering the three treasures at the crown,\ndirecting the five *qi* to the Primordial Source,\nconverging at the *ciliary palace*—\nthus it is called *uniting the head*.\"*\n\nThus composed a gatha:\n*\"Do not speak of faults as trivial—\neven a drop of water can become an endless river.\"*\n\nThe Master said:\n*\"Do not say that merit is abundant—\nprevent the roadside [merit] from being lost or diminished.\nWhen merit is already great,\nstill further add virtue—\nwhen evil thoughts are extinguished,\nmake sure they never arise again.\nOnly when both virtue and vice are forgotten,\nthen all things are thoroughly penetrated.\"*\n\nWhen the Master arrived at the **Hosting Pass** (*Sùjiāng Xiàn*) **County’s Cave Valley Mountain** (*Dòngyù Shān*), a good friend named **Liu Bótōng** asked about *\"movement and stillness\"* (*dòngjìng*).\nThe Master composed a gatha:\n*\"Stillness is natural ease,\nmovement brings distinctions.\nOne thought returns to its origin,\nall ties are utterly severed.\nClouds disperse into the azure void,\na single wheel radiant and pure.\nIlluminating the original nature,\nneither arising nor ceasing.\nJust this is true—\ndo not create convoluted branches.\nLay down, lay down,\nresolute yet gradual.\nSudden and direct—\nwhat more can be said?\nIf you can hold this in reverence,\nact upon it without hesitation.\"*\n\nA monk named **Xīn Chán** came to seek the Master and asked,\n*\"What is the original nature and face?\"*\nThe Master composed a hymn in response:\n*\"Formless, shadowless—how can it be sought?\nThe enlightened see it clearly,\nthe dim-witted sink into obscurity.\nOnly when skin and flesh are utterly shed away,\ndoes it shine round and bright—\na single mass of gold.\"*\n\nThe monk gave the Master a fan,\nand the Master composed two poems in return:\n*\"This fan has never endured autumn’s chill,\nthe golden wind stirs and cannot be held.\nI urge you now to let it go,\nlest the wild wind toss it in vain and cause distress.\"*\n\n*\"The handle’s strength comes from the palm’s grasp,\nreleasing and taking—endless ease.\nWhen you can lift it, you must let it go,\nthen the cool breeze comes—\ndo not summon the wind.\"*\n\nThe monk also gave the Master a pair of shoes,\nand the Master composed a poem in return:\n*\"Gold needles and jade threads crafted with care,\neach step they guide you without fail.\nNot a speck of dust or mud clings to them,\npure and clear they lead to the lotus pool.\"*\n\nWhen the Master reached the **Yù State** (*Yù Zhōu*) **Immortal Elder’s Hall** (*Xiān Wēng Guàn*), hearing cicadas’ clamor,\nhe spontaneously composed a poem:\n*\"The ciliary palace (*ní wán*) turns a hundred times with great effort,\nunaware it flips itself out of the filth of former habits.\nDiscarding the old, foul, encrusted shell,\nit alone ascends the highest bough,\ngreen and resplendent.\"*\n\nWhile staying at the **Immortal Elder’s Hall** (*Xiān Wēng Guàn*), a **Su** official (*Su Tídìan*) came to seek the Master\nand asked about *\"pure stillness and Daoist virtue\"* (*qīngjìng dàodé*).\nThe Master said:\n*\"The soul’s chamber (*líng fǔ*) empty of affairs is *pure stillness*,\na single thought unarisen is *stillness*—\nserene and unmoving is the *Dao*,\nwhen touched, it naturally flows—*this is virtue*.\nFor those beginning their practice,\nstillness means guarding the will and lowering the heart,\nmovement means resting the people and benefiting all things.\"*\n\nThe **Yang** official (*Yáng Tídìan*) asked:\n*\"The practice of the Dao has four matters:\nstanding like a pine, walking like the wind,\nsleeping like a bow, speaking like a bell.\nWhat does this mean?\"*\nThe Master then composed a poem:\n\nThe resolve stands firm as pine enduring winter’s cold,\nlike wind it moves—no barrier can block its path.\nGrasp the spirit’s essence as one strings a bow,\nlest a slip undo all effort, lost beyond recall.\n\nToo many words may bring harm or woe,\nyet silence too is hard to hold.\nFrom now on, act like bell and drum—\nwhen struck, the sound rings clear; when still, it rests in peace.\n\nIf you follow these four matters in the Dao,\nwhat troubles or joys will you still know?\nSwiftly tread the path you came—\nunaware, the dream of coarse grains fades away.\n\nThese four matters divide into inner and outer;\nfor those just beginning, first the outer, then the inner—\nnever separate them.\n\nIn the season of early summer, the Master, in a moment of inspiration, composed a *Màn Tíng Fāng* poem:\n\n*\"The sun and moon like shuttles fly,\ntime flees swift as arrows—unaware, age steals my face.\nOnce, I heard the high willows hum with cicadas’ first cries,\ntoday again I meet the summer’s start—\nsuddenly, another year has passed.\nReflecting, I think: a life is brief—how few moments endure.\nThe word ‘emptiness’—if you hear it early, awaken quickly,\nyet still you linger, delay.\nHurry, cast it all aside, purify the Three Fields.\nRefine the yin, nurture the yang—\nthe clouds of delusion scatter, the radiant sun ascends.\nBrilliant light fills all ten directions,\nilluminating the unborn before its rise.\"*\n\nThe Master said:\nFor those just beginning, practice these four methods of nurturing life:\none, strike the teeth often,\ntwo, swallow the saliva often,\nthree, comb the hair often,\nfour, refine the breath often.\nThese are the lesser vehicle’s ways.\nPractice them diligently, and you will ward off illness, extend life,\nand lighten the body, smooth the skin.\n\nFor those cultivating inwardly:\nfewer thoughts arise in the heart,\nfewer words pass the lips,\nless food fills the belly,\nless sleep claims the night.\n\nThe Holy Mother said:\n*\"These four reductions—\nthe Daoist Immortal’s path is complete.\"*\n\nThe Master arrived at the Temple of Guangwu in Sanxiang. A virtuous man, Qin Weijing, came to pay respects and asked: *\"What is the 'having within nothing'?\"*\n\nThe Master replied:\n*\"Though practitioners possess the Four Great Aggregates*—\ntheir bodies formed by the six elements*—*\nwithin the realm of love and desire,\ntheir minds are free of even the faintest trace of dusty thoughts—\nthis is the 'having within nothing.'\n\nIt is also the 'having-form body without form,'*\na wondrous essence.\n\nThe Ancestral Master said:\n*'Having form is illusion,\nhaving no form is truth.'*\n\nThe man asked again: *\"What is 'nothing within having'?\"*\n\nThe Master replied:\n*\"Though the mind is without passion,\nthe heart is without thought,\nnot clinging to coarse emptiness,\none true nature remains luminous and unobscured—\nit must be 'not-empty within emptiness,'\nwherefrom the unencumbered arises from the void.\nAs the ancients said:\n*'From emptiness comes white snow,\nfrom stillness emerges the yellow sprout.'*\n\nThe man asked further about the two words, *dynamic* and *static*.\n\nThe Master replied:\n*\"The dynamic is the mind,\nthe static is the nature—*\nwhen the mind stirs, nature vanishes;\nwhen the mind ceases, nature manifests.\"*\n\nThe Daoist said: *\"How is nature extinguished?\"*\n\nThe Master replied:\n*\"When the guest grows strong and the host weak,\nthe original truth is obscured.\"*\n\nThe Daoist said: *\"How is the mind extinguished?\"*\n\nThe Master replied:\n*\"When the host stands upright and the guest flees,\nthoughts vanish and emotions are forgotten.\"*\n\nThe Master arrived in Fuchang County, where a man sat in meditation. The Master approached and asked: *\"When will the gentleman leave the garden?\"*\n\nThe man answered: *\"When the garden is overturned, I shall depart.\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"If the garden is overturned,\nwhere will one find a place to rest?\"*\n\nThe gentleman replied: *\"The overturned garden is but a metaphor.\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"Why wait for decay\nbefore knowing emptiness?\"*\n\nIndeed, those who sit in meditation are not frivolous—\nit is the arena for testing the Immortal’s ascent,\nknown as the *Three Static Gates*.\n\nThus the scripture says:\n*\"Small Static, a hundred days;\nMedium Static, two hundred days;\nGreat Static, three hundred days.*\nOne must discern right from wrong,\nnot cling to forms.\n\nAs the ancients said:\n*'All forms are mere illusion.'*\n\nWithin the hundred days,\nrefine and temper the mind—\nno trace of dust or defilement remains.\nRegulate food and flavor,\nresist the demons of sleep,\nadjust the breath to softness,\nguard the spirit within,\nentering the realm of the *Himless*,\nthe land of the *Non-existent*.\nIf one attains clarity like water,\nor stillness like ice,\nover time, a luminous, empty essence will naturally form—\nthis can be preserved.\n\nIf the essence is nurtured into its utmost treasure,\nthen the spirit may be adjusted to emerge from its shell,\nmoving near and far with ease,\ncoming and going with familiarity—\nwhen one wishes to dwell, it follows circumstances;\nwhen one wishes to depart, it sheds the shell.\n\nDo not within the garden\ntwist and strain in myriad ways,\ntaking apparitions as true—\nthis leads to clinging to spirits and demons.\nAs the ancients said:\n*'The Dao has no ghosts or gods,\nit comes alone and goes alone.'*\n\nThe Former Master said:\n*'Reside in the garden, guard the static,\nfrom stillness arises the yang—*\nover time, with refinement,\none attains the core,\nand naturally achieves the Way.'*\n\nThe Master arrived at Lao Degou’s Hermitage in Lushan, where Master Shen came to inquire about where to begin cultivation. The Master said: *\"The starting point requires no hands—\nnurture, and it will naturally arise.\nWhen the practice reaches the *Leakless Abode*,\none attains eternal longevity.\"*\n\nFor beginners, the eight methods must not be abandoned:\nnurture the *body*,\nnurture the *stomach*,\nnurture the *heart*,\nnurture the *spirit*,\nnurture the *qi*,\nnurture the *essence*,\nnurture the *nature*,\nnurture the *wisdom*.\n\nThose who nurture the *body*\nmust reduce weight and seek lightness;\nthose who nurture the *stomach*\nmust regulate food and diminish flavor;\nthose who nurture the *heart*\nmust think little and desire less;\nthose who nurture the *spirit*\nmust be frugal in affairs and avoid prying;\nthose who nurture the *qi*\nmust restrain speech and seal the mouth;\nthose who nurture the *essence*\nmust curb lust and listen to few sounds;\nthose who nurture the *nature*\nmust settle knowledge and not ponder;\nthose who nurture the *wisdom*\nmust be deeply still and silent.\n\nThese eight methods must not be forsaken.\n\nThen the Master composed a poem:\n\nThe Master said:\n*\"Practice does not require seeking elsewhere—\nthe Seven Treasures Forest lies within the mind.\nPerceiving the Mystery Pass’s true unity,\nthen you will see the Heavenly Heart.*\n\nWhen the Master arrived at An East State,\na Daoist friend, Gao Ming, came from afar to visit the Master and asked:\n‘What is the meaning of *returning light* and *reverting illumination*?’\n\nThe Master replied:\n‘*Returning light* is when a single thought returns to its origin.\n*Reverting illumination* is when one realizes the past has already passed.\nDo not let *returning light* wander outward—\nexamine *reverting illumination* within yourself.\nThe Confucianists speak of *earlier enlightenment* and *later enlightenment*.\nThe Daoists say *self-enlightenment* surpasses enlightening others.\n*Self-enlightenment* means no mistakes occur,\nwhile enlightening others leads to confusion of the true nature.\nOne must constantly examine and reflect,\nrestraining thoughts and calming the mind,\nuntil no thought remains to be restrained,\nno awareness remains to be examined—\nwhen all worldly dust does not cling,\nthen one is truly a Daoist.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*Amid a thousand flowers, I pass—\nno petal touches my body.*\nThis is it.\n\nAgain, the friend asked:\n‘How can one remain unmixed yet untouched by all dust?’\n\nThe Master replied:\n‘Water moves itself while mountains stand still,\nthe sky remains at ease while clouds are ever-busy.\nIf you follow the world’s chaotic affairs,\nI remain as I am—\nthe mind must rule supreme,\nnot swayed by things,\nnot deceived by circumstances.\nHow else can one fully attain one’s true *Suchness*?’\n\nWhen the Master arrived at the Great Yi Mountain’s ancient Buddha Erta Temple,\nhe conversed with Master Liang. Then, Iron Ox Master came to visit the Master,\nbowing and asking for guidance on the *path of life and death*\nand instruction on *the place of origin*.\nThe Master said:\n‘Success and failure—\nthis is the *path of life and death*;\nNo coming, no going—\nthis is the *place of origin*.’\n\nIron Ox bowed and said:\n‘All day I only turn the wheel and staff,\nyet I do not recognize the *reed flowers facing the sorrel red*.’\n\nThe Master replied:\n‘Just this moment of *returning light*—\nthis is the *place of origin*.\nLaying down the wheel and staff in surrender—\nthis is how one leaves the *path of life and death*.’\nAnd again said:\n‘Without the east wind, flowers do not bloom,\nyet when they bloom, the wind blows them away.\nThis is the *path of life and death*.\nNo clouds rise over the misty peaks,\nthe moon’s reflection rests in the heart of the river—\nthis is the *place of origin*.\nNow I speak plainly to you:\nIf emotions fade and thoughts vanish,\nthis is the *gate of life*;\nIf intentions stray and the heart raves,\nthis is the *path of death*.\nWhen the heart does not consort with the myriad *dharmas*,\none nature stands alone and luminous,\ndeeply still yet uniquely self-illuminating—\nthis is the *place of origin*.’\n\nThe Master composed another poem:\n---\n*The unborn, unmade nature shines serene,\nNo coming, no going—emerging from the Three Thousand Worlds.\nTo know this turning point of true origin,\nOne must tread through the void and pierce the Mysterious Dao.*\n\nWhen the Master arrived at the Ilu Mountain’s Chongyang Cave,\na nun, Zhou Daolong, came to visit the Master and asked about *sitting in the bowl*.\nThe Master replied:\n‘The *bowl* is the *origin*—\nit is formed from the *golden origin*.\nThe *golden origin* refers to *golden emotions* and *wooden nature*.\nWhen emotions and nature align,\nthis is likened to the *bowl*.\nEmotions are like *waves*,\nnature is like *water*.\n*Sitting in the bowl* means abandoning emotions and stabilizing nature.\nThe small hole in the *bowl* signifies *ascending and descending*.\nWhen there is ascending, there is descending;\nwhen there is fullness, there is depletion.\nAt the time of stabilizing the *bowl*,\none must seal the mouth and remain silent,\nupright the body and sit properly,\ncutting off all thoughts and forgetting speech.\nThis is the teaching of emotions and nature aligning,\nembracing the *One Spirit*.’\n\nThen, a respectful scholar, Chen Hongdao, bowed before the Master and asked:\n‘What is the *original face*?’\n\nThe Master replied:\n‘Neither approaching nor departing from this.\nIf *original face* means departing from this,\nhow can the *Four Great Elements* and *Six Sense Gates* move and rest,\napply throughout the body and interchange in use?\nIf *original face* means approaching this,\neven the dead possess *Four Great Elements* and *Six Roots*—\nhow can they move?’\n\nConsider this: before your parents gave birth to you,\nthere were no *Four Great Elements* or *Six Roots*.\nWhat is movement and rest?\nWhat do you perceive?\nThe Daoist Canon says:\n*Seeing does not see Me,\nhearing does not hear Me.*\n*Detached from all boundaries,*\n*this is called the Wondrous Dao.*\n\nThe Buddha said:\n*If one seeks Me through form,*\n*or through sound to find Me,*\n*that person follows the wrong path*\n*and cannot see the Tathagata.*\n\nThe formless can generate the formed,\nthe shapeless can control the shaped.\nThe *original face* is not something to be observed through the five colors,\nnor heard through the five sounds.\nWithout eyes, one can see;\nwithout ears, one can hear;\nwithout a nose, one can smell;\nwithout a tongue, one can taste;\nwithout a mouth, one can speak;\nwithout hands, one can strike;\nwithout feet, one can walk.\nThe *original nature* and *Dharmakaya*—\nthe moment they move, they are constrained.\nWhen the *Six Roots* are still and settled,\nthe *original face* naturally reveals itself.\nNow, when one moves,\nit is the *Master* commanding the *slave*;\nwhen one is still and settled,\nthe *slave* returns to its *Master’s* place.\nConfusion and distraction are *ghosts*;\ndeep clarity and insight are *spirits*.\nThose who practice to see the *original face*\nmust screen out all entanglements,\npurify the *Six Roots*,\nhold the mind in singularity,\nallow not even a hair’s breadth of distinction,\nlet no thread of attachment remain—\nthen the clouds of delusion will naturally disperse,\nand the *nature-moon* will shine brightly.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*When the mist clears, the sun’s radiance gleams;\ndust struggles to reflect its brilliance.*\nThe Master composed a verse:\n---\n*Seeing the formless yet perceiving the formed,\nFrom the start, I never stirred a speck of dust.\nAbandoning all myriad dharmas,\nI reveal the unbroken original body.*\n\nWhen the Master arrived at the Tai Bai Mountain’s Anle Nest,\na lecturer, Chen Hongdao, came to visit the Master and asked:\n‘In *The Zhuangzi’s* *Qixia* Chapter, it says:\n*The great knowing is leisurely and spacious,\nthe small knowing is partial and narrow;\nthe great speech is ardent and vast,\nthe small speech is verbose and petty.*\nWhat does this mean?’\n\nThe Master replied:\n‘The *great knowing* is leisurely and spacious—\nit accepts all without exclusion.\nThe *small knowing* is partial and narrow—\nit distinguishes between things.\nThis is the same *knowing*, yet different in scope.\n\nThe *great speech* is ardent and vast—\nit unifies *right and wrong*.\nThe *small speech* is verbose and petty—\nit mimics the appearance of chattering.\n\nThis passage speaks of differences,\nyet all four arise from the same source.\nThe myriad things and myriad emotions\nvary in their taking and discarding—\nif there is a true *Master* guiding them naturally.\n\nDo you wish to see the true *Master*?\nAh—\nthough it has no trace of entering or exiting,\nall things are fully revealed, are they not?’\n\nA Daoist disciple, Master Liu Zonghai, asked the Teacher: *\"What does it mean to cultivate and refine?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"To cultivate is to refine one’s outward conduct; to refine is to temper one’s body and mind. Cultivating outward conduct means caring for orphans and widows, respecting the elderly and pitying the poor, building bridges and roads, aiding the afflicted and resolving difficulties—these amount to eight hundred practices. Refining body and mind means dwelling in stillness, guarding the environment, tempering the body and refining the mind, conserving essence and nurturing *qi*, refining the spirit and returning to emptiness—these amount to three thousand practices. Cultivating outward conduct generates *virtue*; refining inwardly generates *wisdom*. When both *virtue* and *wisdom* are complete, one transcends birth and death.\"*\n\nAgain, [the disciple asked]: *\"Why is it that a man of sixty-four cannot cultivate his life?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"Humans are the most refined of all things, with a natural lifespan of forty-three thousand two hundred days. Their spirit comprises thirty-six thousand units, their original *yang* and true *qi* weigh three hundred eighty-four *liǎng*. This corresponds internally to *Qián* [乾]. If one fails to preserve and nurture it, allowing it to dissipate, then one perishes prematurely in midlife. *Qián* is the fullness of six *yang* energies, yet one does not yet know how to act or apply them. To know this and practice refinement is to become an immortal.\n\nFrom fifteen to twenty-five years old, if one’s emissions and expenditures do not cease, the true *qi* diminishes by forty-eight *liǎng*, leaving what corresponds to *Jiǔ* [姤]. If one’s desires grow excessive, another ten years pass, and the *qi* diminishes another forty-eight *liǎng*, leaving what corresponds to *Dùn* [遁]. If one still fails to preserve and nurture it, another ten years pass, and the *qi* diminishes another forty-eight *liǎng*, leaving what corresponds to *Pǐ* [否]. At this point, one reaches the central *qi* of heaven and earth. If one still does not practice cultivation, another ten years pass, and the *qi* diminishes by seventy-two *liǎng*, corresponding to *Guān* [观]. If one still fails to supplement and nourish it, another five years pass, and the *qi* diminishes by ninety-six *liǎng*, leaving what corresponds to *Bō* [剥]. If one still does not preserve and nurture it, at sixty-four—the completion of the sixty-four *guà*—the original *qi* is exhausted, corresponding internally to *Kūn* [坤]. *Kūn* is pure *yin*; one survives only by relying on the *qi* of grains, hence the name *gǒushòu* [苟寿, \"barely alive\"]. At this stage, death is near, and one can no longer refine the elixir. Those whose decline is even more severe may perish before this point, like an old tree struck by great winds or fire—its withering and death are inevitable.\n\nAll who practice must understand the measure of *liǎng* and adjust their efforts accordingly. The Ancestral Teacher said: *‘One gourd contains three hundred eighty-four liǎng*—this is what is meant.’*\n\nA disciple named Chen asked about the *shījiě* [尸解, \"corpse resolution\"] method.\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"There are five types of *shījiě*: those resolved by sword, text, water, fire, and *tài-yīn* [太阴]. Sword-resolution is like Guo Pu being executed in the marketplace, Zhou Pu being sawn apart. Text-resolution is like Zhang Lang’s form appearing on a staff, Bodhidharma departing with a single sandal. Water-resolution is like Feng Yi drowning in the great river, Tai Bai sinking into the depths. Fire-resolution is like Feng Zhi burning beneath a fire tree, Lu Xian ascending from a thatched hut. *Tài-yīn* resolution is when the corpse’s color does not change, the flesh does not turn green, the skin does not wrinkle, the eyes retain their luster, and the limbs remain supple—this too is *shījiě*. The flesh does not decay for a hundred years, and the body can rise again as a living person. Though such is the case, one still does not attain the Dao of the Heavenly Immortal—only non-death is achieved.\"*\n\nThat year, in the ninth month of the *bǐngyín* [丙寅] year, the Teacher arrived at the East Peak of Huayang and stayed at the Xiexian Temple. Catching rain leaking through the roof, he composed a poem:\n\n---\n*The roof leaks, yet I do not leak;\nOthers are busy, yet I am not.\nI shift to where my body rests secure,\nAnd all worldly thoughts dissolve.*\n\nOn the fifteenth of that month, the Full Truth Daoists Dong Gūyún, Wang Yíshān, and Hé Lǎnyún departed for the Wànshòu Palace in Dānyáng to perform the *zhǔbō* [主钵, \"main alms ceremony\"], composing a poem as they took leave:\n\n---\n*Deep mountains and secluded valleys are my home,\nA life of simplicity I hold in pride.\nMy clay bowl ever holds honeyed wine,\nMy porcelain pot brews tea from *gòuyá* leaves.\nAt leisure, I point to the moon beyond the sky,\nIn boredom, I gaze upon flowers by the stream.\nToday I bid farewell to friends and depart—\nGazing afar at forests and valleys, sighing in vain.*\n\nAt that time, on the twenty-second of the ninth month, they arrived at the Wànshòu Palace in Dānyáng. A military commander named Deng paid his respects to the Teacher, saying: *\"I have long heard of your Dao, Master.\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"I merely dwell in the mountains, nurturing my simplicity.\"*\n\nThe commander said: *\"If one could truly grasp this ‘simplicity,’ one would have cultivated the Dao to its fullest.\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"To conceal one’s light and hide one’s brilliance, to reveal one’s true nature and embrace simplicity—though eloquent, one speaks not; though skilled, one appears clumsy. The eyes do not perceive colors, the ears do not hear sounds, though the mouth responds to affairs, the heart harbors no desires. The heart has no heart; within thought, there is no thought. This is how I nurture my simplicity.\"*\n\nThe commander asked: *\"What are the meanings of *xìng* [性, nature] and *mìng* [命, fate/life]?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"Nature is the substance of life; life is the function of nature. Without substance, function lacks clarity; without function, substance lacks completeness. Root and branch are inherently connected—yet for convenience, we divide them into two.\"*\n\nThe commander asked: *\"If nature and life are inherently unified, why divide them?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"Nature and life are originally one, but desires separate them. The ancients said: *‘Wood and metal divide the hare and rabbit’*—this is so.\"*\n\nThe commander asked: *\"How does nature relate to the Dao?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"It is like the analogy of the Golden Elixir. True nature endures through kalpas, unobstructed in entering or exiting, hence it is compared to gold in firmness, steel in sharpness, and the elixir in perfection. Zhongyang Di Jun said:\n*‘True nature is called the Golden Elixir;\nFour false forms are the furnace to refine it into a sphere.\nUnstained, unthinking, free of delusion—\nNaturally it rolls forth to the Immortal Platform.’*\nThis is it.\"*\n\nThe next day, the assembly completed their inquiries.\n\nThe Teacher said:\n*\"Rotten wood needs no carving, and the clumsy man requires no effort to quiet his mind. Eloquence is not as good as silence, cleverness is not as good as clumsiness. A stone may contain jade but is harmed by its presence, and a clam may hold a pearl but loses its life because of it. This is indeed the truth without deceit.\"*\n\nThen he recited a poem:\n*\"A hundred-foot green pine in the village,\nUnmoved by the spring wind’s passing.\nIts branches sway freely, tossed about—\nYet its roots remain deep, unmoving.\"*\n\nThe *Record of Adaptation to Circumstances* (Volume One and Volume Two) was completed.\n**Song Han Dao Ren Wu Hou Zi** recounted the full teaching of **He Dao Quan**.\nThe disciple **Jia Dao Xuan** compiled and gathered it.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"What is the principle behind Master Dong’s sitting in the encircled space?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"The Master said: The encircled space is one principle, but transmission differs. The encircled space is the meaning of returning to the origin and restoring the root—nothing more than cultivating stillness.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"There are three thousand six hundred teachings; which one do you follow?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"I have received the Master’s oral instructions, which lie beyond the count of three thousand six hundred.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Do you mean an esoteric path?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"The Master said: ‘Four walls without openings, eight directions without gates—\nThe Great Dao is boundless, and void cannot measure it.\nBecause disciples vary in wisdom and folly,\nGreat and small vehicles arise.\nThis is the heart’s own deviation; the Great Dao knows no contrary or conforming.’\nSince disciples differ in virtue and wisdom, and in depth of roots,\nthe sages established these three teachings to accommodate their capacities.\nThe term *vehicle* means a means of conveyance—\nlike a large cart carrying heavy goods,\na medium cart carrying medium goods,\nand a small cart carrying light goods.\nThey raise disciples according to their sharpness or dullness of understanding—\nthis is the sages’ teaching adapted to each circumstance.\nThe *use* may vary in three ways, but the *Dao* remains one.\nThe ancients said: ‘Waters flow in different streams,\nyet all return to the same source—\nhow could there be any division?’\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Master Dong’s principle of sitting in the encircled space—\nyou must know it?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"The Master once spoke of the principles of dead encircled space and living encircled space.\nThe dead encircled space is when four walls surround you,\nand the sitter remains inside, sealing the door to prevent exit or entry,\nreceiving meals at set times.\nOne must settle the body, extinguish thoughts,\ncalm the *qi*, and harmonize the spirit.\nAfter a hundred days, they emerge—\nthose with resolve make progress,\nwhile those without may fall ill instead.\nThe living encircled space is when the four great elements are falsely formed into walls,\nand jade seals and golden locks serve as barriers.\nA single spark of luminous consciousness remains within,\nnever dimmed, moment by moment.\nThe spirit does not leave the *qi*, nor does the *qi* leave the spirit.\nInternal thoughts do not escape, external thoughts do not intrude.\nAmidst chaos, one finds stillness;\nstillness contains clarity.\nThe spirit guards internally, undisturbed by the outside.\nThus, a hundred days here surpass a thousand days in dead encircled space.\nThe dead encircled space restrains the form but fails to nourish the spirit—\neven if it controls the mind, it is forced and artificial,\nlike caging a monkey or tethering a horse.\nRemoving the cage or rope, they remain as wild and flawed as before—\nthis is not natural.\nIf one can instead refine the heart through interaction with all things,\nit is better than external artificial restraint.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"How does one refine the heart through interaction with all things?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"When one sees all kinds of beings,\nnot loving them means not being attached to things;\nwhen one encounters all kinds of circumstances,\nremaining unmoved means not being swayed by them.\nThrough such prolonged refinement,\none attains the three *dhyānas* of no-mind—\nin stillness, one does not move;\nin motion, one does not move—\nthis is the true stillness, the true *dhyāna*.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"From ancient times, even immortals have practiced sitting in the encircled space—\nwhy is that?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"The early sages sat in the encircled space,\nnot because they had not attained enlightenment,\nbut because later disciples, seeing forms and stirred by emotions,\nhearing sounds and moved by thoughts,\nneeded a hundred days of seclusion to keep their minds from chaos.\nThus, they set an example for later generations,\na convenient method to teach disciples how to cultivate and achieve success,\nreturning to the origin and restoring the root.\nEven as Bodhidharma came from the West,\nsat facing the wall at Shaolin for nine years,\nand received the transmission of *shen guang* (神光),\nthe Master was not yet unenlightened—\nall was done to establish a model for later disciples.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Today, there are still those who sit facing the wall—\nwhy do they not attain enlightenment?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"They only know how to adorn the external forms,\nnot recognizing the true essence within.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"What is the meaning of ‘covering the head to create transformation’?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"Covering the head teaches one to contain their thoughts,\nfacing the wall means seeing without seeing—\nit is also turning away from external circumstances and focusing inward.\nThe *Observing the Dao Sutra* says: ‘Do not see what is desirable,\nso the heart does not become disordered.’\nThe cultivator must not let the eyes perceive colors,\nnor the ears listen to sounds.\nSeeing without seeing, hearing without hearing—\ncutting off sounds and colors, eliminating thoughts and worries.\nOnly adorning the external form brings no lasting benefit.\"*\n\n**Master Lü** said:\n*\"To shatter the illusion of void perception,\nthen the fists come and go—\nthe best way to live.\nThose who do not know the joy of containing thoughts beneath the covered head\nmock the ancient Western Masters who came before.\"*\n\nAfter finishing his words,\nsomeone asked: *\"Earlier, you said it lies beyond the three thousand six hundred teachings—\nhow exactly does one cultivate and refine?\nWhere does one establish the furnace and tripod?\nWhat are the alchemical ingredients?\nHow does one use water and fire to temper them?\nHow does one complete the elixir?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"The heavens and earth are the furnace and tripod,\n*jing*, *qi*, and *shen* are the alchemical ingredients.\nStillness and *dhyāna* are the water,\ninsight and illumination are the fire.\nWith single-minded intent, harmonize the three treasures,\ncompact them into a pill,\nblend them into one,\nand let them not disperse over time—\nthen the elixir is complete.\nBut even this is adding dust to the eyes—\ndiscard the ‘one’ and merge with the Dao.\n**Master Li Qing’an** wrote:\n*'Propping up heaven and supporting earth are too vague—\nonly the original spirit may dwell within.\nIf one leaves anything behind in this,\nhow could they verify the Dao and attain emptiness?'*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Does this not risk falling into emptiness?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"If there is awareness and illumination,\nhow could emptiness be attained?\"\n\nSomeone asked: *\"If there is awareness and illumination, does it not inevitably cling to phenomena as they arise?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"Even though the lamp’s light illuminates narrowly,\nits flame never strays from the stand.\nHe then composed a poem:*\n*The myriad sounds of wind are void of sentiment,\nthe thousand rivers reflect the moon’s equal light.\nPhenomena, from the start, bear no stain or attachment—\nmountains stand majestic, waters flow freely.*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"What then is the Dao?\"*\n\nThe Teacher said: *\"Where the Five Phases do not reach,\nand before the single *qi* arises—there it is.\"*\n\nAgain, someone asked: *\"Where does the Dao reside for those who cultivate?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"Where good and evil are both forgotten,\nand before a single thought takes form—\nin the depths of stillness and silence,\none attains the Dao.\"*\n\nAgain, someone asked: *\"How does one cultivate and nourish oneself to reach this state?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"One must integrate the essence and function.\"*\n\nAgain, someone asked: *\"What is the essence and function?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"The function of the Dao is to bring peace to people and benefit all things;\nthe essence of the Dao must be in non-action and tranquility.\nIf one can subdue their thoughts and not let them arise,\nnaturally, they will be tranquil and without action.\nAll who do not stir their thoughts—\nneither praise nor blame takes root,\nanger nor joy oversteps—\nthese are the ones who guard the Dao.\"*\n\nAgain, someone asked: *\"Are there matters of Heavenly Rewards and Hellish Punishments?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"If there is no Heavenly Reward, then there is none;\nif there is, it is for the virtuous to ascend.\nIf there is no Hellish Punishment, then there is none;\nif there is, it is for the wicked to descend.\nThe Dao scriptures say:\n‘No fear of imprisonment in life,\nno suffering of annihilation after death.’\nUnder the current sacred governance,\nrewarding virtue and punishing evil—\nthis is Heavenly Reward and Hellish Punishment.\nThe ancient sages spoke of countless teachings and doctrines,\nwith loyalty and filial piety as foremost.\nIn both heaven and earth,\nconvenience is the first principle.\"*\n\nA disciple presented a poem to the Teacher, who then composed a reply:\n*\"A pair of fire-sinews, all of steel throughout.\nPiercing straight through, they guide both action and retreat.\nNever leaving the furnace and stove,\nthey come and go, ever in attendance.\nWithdrawing and adding, clustered and refined,\nflames blaze bright in a thousand hues.\nDispelling all hidden darkness,\nforging pure yang.\nCast into fire, they do not burn,\nthrown into water, they face no hindrance.\nDrawn from the ashes, whole and revealed,\nsuddenly, they radiate light across the earth.*\n\nAgain, the Teacher wrote:\n*\"Within the furnace and stove, one stands best,\ndo not let dust settle on the walls.\nSwiftly stir the buried flames of the Dao—\nlet warmth spread across heaven and earth like spring.*\n\nThe Teacher sat in a quiet chamber,\nwhen a monk named Cōngdū came to inquire,\nasking: *\"If a woman approaches you face-to-face,\ndo you see her as a woman or as a man?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"This is an ancient case for public discussion—\nyou must ponder and awaken to it yourself.\nIf I were to explain, it would hinder your practice.\"*\n\nThe monk repeatedly begged for an explanation,\nso the Teacher scolded him: *\"Seeing her as a woman is clinging to forms;\nseeing her as a man is blindness to sight.\nTrue nature is inherently undivided—\nattachment to forms creates distinctions.\nTurn away from the form and observe the mind—\nall things will then be thoroughly understood.\"*\n\nThe Teacher again scolded: *\"Learn to go like falling flowers and flowing water.\"*\n\nThe monk remained silent.\n\nThe Teacher said: *\"Seeing as not seeing—\nyou know of men and women;\nthe heart without a heart—\nthere are still merits and faults.\nThe Great Dao knows no division of men and women—\nwhy must you distinguish them?\nThe scriptures say: ‘Observe all as one’,\nyet still, you cling to forms.\nVigorously pass beyond them—\nresponding to affairs like the wind’s myriad sounds,\nperceiving things like the moon’s reflection on a thousand rivers—\nsuch a one is a true sage.\"*\n\nThe monk bowed and departed.\n\nThe Teacher, still in the quiet chamber,\nwas visited by a magistrate named Hé,\nwho asked: *\"Teacher, how do you practice sitting still?\nWhat is your method?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"I merely cultivate simplicity.\"*\n\nThe magistrate said: *\"To have no skill in a hundred matters is to be simple—\nhow then do you attain the Dao of immortality?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"My simplicity is the simplicity of the ancients—\nit is sincere resolve and adherence to one’s proper place,\nwithout contrivance, naturally so.\nThe *Thunder Classic* says:\n‘Use sincerity as if it were stupidity,\nuse silence as if it were dullness,\nuse gentleness as if it were clumsiness—\nthis is it.’\nIf one returns to simplicity, roots in origin, and reclaims their true nature,\nknows to preserve white while guarding black,\ncan generate wisdom,\ntranscend birth and death,\nthey may become an immortal or a Buddha.\nHow could this be compared to the simplicity of having no skill in a hundred matters?\"*\n\nThe magistrate again asked: *\"If the heart is still, it surpasses even a quiet chamber;\nforgetting phenomena is not the same as forgetting the heart—\nthen, what use is stillness?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"The autumn night sky, clear and blue,\nthe moon shines brighter when the clouds are absent.\nMoreover, a quiet chamber keeps external demons out,\na still heart prevents internal demons from arising.\nWhen both inner and outer are tranquil,\nthe body and mind are luminous—\nthis is the Daoist’s true livelihood.\nThe *Laozi* says: ‘Do not see what is desirable, so the heart does not become disturbed.’\nThe *Scriptures of the Immortal and True* say: ‘When external phenomena do not intrude, the inner spirit naturally settles.’\nThis is what I mean.\"*\n\nThe magistrate again asked: *\"The Dao scriptures say: ‘Those who do not lose their place endure long.’\nWhat is this principle?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"This principle applies in three ways—\nto ministers, commoners, and cultivators—\neach has their own place where they find fulfillment.\nIf one does not lose their place,\nthey attain enduring longevity.\n\nFor ministers,\nit is loyalty to the ruler and benefit to the nation,\nconcern for the army and love for the people,\njustice without bias,\nbalancing strength and flexibility—\nnot losing their place means they attain lasting honor and wealth.\n\nFor commoners,\nit is fear of the law,\nunderstanding human relationships,\nindustry and frugality—\nnot losing their place means they attain lasting prosperity in their household.\n\nFor cultivators,\nit is avoiding defilement by worldly dust,\nremaining untouched by secular affairs,\na single heart in tranquility,\nthe Three Treasures blended into one—\nnot losing their place means they attain enduring life and vitality.\n\nMoreover, within each person’s body,\nthere are the Golden Hall and Jade Chamber,\nthe Soul Stand and Vermilion Palace,\nthe Hidden Door and Life Gate,\nthe Mystic Pass and Elixir Barrier.\nIf one does not cultivate themselves,\nthese gradually decay,\nand the master has nowhere to dwell—\nthis is losing one’s place.\"*\n\nThe magistrate again asked: *\"The scriptures say: ‘Those who do not perish after death are long-lived.’\nWhat does this mean?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"For cultivators at the moment of departure,\nwhen their vital *qi* is exhausted but the Dao *qi* remains,\nwhen their body dies but their true nature does not perish—\nthey stand firm and unshaken,\nstill and clear as if congealed,\nphenomena cannot lure them,\ncreation cannot bind them,\nthey do not turn or return,\nfree and at ease,\nenduring through all ages—\nthis is the boundless longevity.\"*\n\nThe common man is otherwise,\nhis physical form is limited,\nhis lifespan fixed by Heaven’s decree.\nThe four great elements disperse,\nthe one true essence scatters in chaos,\nensnared by the affections of past lives,\ndriven by the forces of creation,\nno longer their own master,\nled into the womb to take rebirth,\nsuffering according to their karma,\nendlessly cycling through transmigration—\nthus they cannot attain enduring longevity.\n\nThe Sage of old said:\n*\"The physical form has numbered limits,\nthe Dharma-body is boundless and eternal.\nRecognize the face of life before you,\nstill like the moon, clear as wind.\"*\n\nThe Master Ji said:\n*\"The form may be forgotten,\nbut Heaven’s true essence shall not.\nThose who do not forget it,\nattain the longevity of neither death nor birth.\"*\n\nThe Buddhist teachings say:\n*\"When mundane forms perish, the true nature does not—\nthe Awakened *Dharma*-body, untainted by dust.\nUnderstanding the distinction of transient and eternal roots,\nthis is the Buddha’s eye seeing the Thus-Come One.\nSuch longevity knows no end,\nyet only those who cultivate may reach this state.\"*\n\nThe magistrate bowed and took his leave.\n\nThere was Deng the Military Commander,\nwho sent Li the Cavalry Officer\nto deliver a jade-bamboo staff to the Teacher.\nThe Teacher then composed a verse in reply:\n\n*\"Golden sprouts rise from the earth,\nemerald leaves grow cold beneath the sky.\nSkin smooth as lacquer,\nheart sharp as frost.\nIts nodes pierce the void’s realm,\nits roots entwine with ancient Daoic halls.\nWise indeed is he who plucked it—\nonly the enlightened dare wield it.\nIn water, it knows depth and shallows,\non mountains, it stands firm.\nIt shatters the path of birth and death,\nsuddenly entering the realm of the Immortals.\"*\n\nLi the Cavalry Officer received the verse,\nbowed, and asked:\n*\"In days past, Master Zhi Gong,\nwhy did he hang a whisk, scissors, and a ruler\non his staff? What was its meaning?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"This is the silent Zen of non-speech,\na metaphor pointing to self-examination and awakening.\nI now speak to you instead.\"*\n\nThe staff is not merely the staff in one’s hand,\nbut the sovereign master within the body.\n\nThe scissors and ruler are but tools\nto urge the practitioner to examine and measure\nthe uneven lengths of his mind’s thoughts and worries,\ncutting them swiftly away.\n\nThe whisk is to sweep away\nthe mental afflictions that cling.\n\nThis practice lies entirely within the staff—\ndo not seek it externally.\nIf it is spoken of externally, it is not the true Dao.\n\nWithout thoughts to sweep aside,\nwithout flaws to trim,\nthe scissors, ruler, and whisk are useless—\nonly the staff remains constant.\n\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"When the sky’s clouds and mist disperse,\na lone wheel stands revealed.\"*\n\nThe Teacher composed a *Zhìgū Tiān* poem:\n\n*\"Master Zhi Gong was no ordinary monk.\nScissors, ruler, and whisk hung on his staff.\nA holy monk does not measure others—\neach must weigh his own heart’s depths.\nThis wisdom can lean on the staff,\nfreed from worldly ties, returned to the home of truth.\nIf the mind’s measure is uneven, cut it away,\nswept clean of dust, its nature bright as a pearl.\"*\n\nIn the year *Wùchén* (戊辰), the eighth month,\nafter the full moon’s day,\nthe Teacher returned to Huáyáng Yù (華陽嶺) and gazed upon the *Wàngxiāng Tái* (望鄉台).\nAfter a hundred days of seclusion, he emerged,\nand composed this poem:\n\n*\"A hundred days of practice—\nits subtlety now profound.\nWooden Dragon aids in rising from the mortal palace,\nGolden Tiger comes to chase the northern springs of the *Kǎn* (坎).\nThe Four Great Elements serve as crucible and furnace,\nThe Three Vermin (三尸) skillfully stir the cauldron’s brew.\nRefined, a priceless treasure emerges—\nits radiance piercing the ninefold heavens.\"*\n\nWhen the Teacher arrived at the *Yuánjūn Ci* (元君祠) in Cháng’ān’s northern gate,\nsome mocked him, saying his crucible and cauldron were worn with age.\n\nThe Teacher smiled and composed this poem:\n\n*\"Do not say the crucible and cauldron are new or old—\nonly seek their truth within yourself.\nFrom emptiness, plucked the Purple Lingzhi (紫靈芝),\nit is the treasure of eternal life.\"*\n\nUpon emerging from seclusion, the Teacher composed two *Wúmèng Lìng* (無夢令) poems:\n\n*\"A hundred days like polishing a priceless mirror,\ndust gone, its light now pure and clear.\nSeeing the original truth,\na path opens to the Dao’s holy saints.\nTrue stillness, true stillness—\nthe divine mind itself reveals the right way.\"*\n\n*\"Again\"*\n\n*\"A hundred days’ practice now complete,\nunlocking the bonds already formed.\nA thunderous cry in the cold—\nflaming red light from the ocean’s depths.\nParting, parting—\njade halls and crystal towers grow whiter with snow.\n\nThe Teacher was at the Yuánjūn Temple,\nwhen a Zen monk from Hǎifú in Xīshǔ came to pay homage,\nasking: 'In days past, a monk asked Dongmen,\nwho replied in three turns: *When the World-Honored One held the flower assembly at Spirit Mountain\nand raised the flower before the assembly, what did Kāśyapa’s smile signify?*\nDongmen said: *The one who sells gold meets the one who buys gold.*\nThe monk asked: *If everyone laughed, what then?*\nDongmen said: *Then it would be a universal offering of merit.*\nThe monk asked: *If everyone did not laugh, what then?*\nDongmen said: *If the transaction’s goods remain, there must be someone to pay for them.*\nI beg you, how should this be understood?'\n\nThe Teacher said: 'Dongmen’s old answer was rooted in compassion,\nyet you remain lost in confusion.\nThe World-Honored One’s flower-raising was a direct transmission,\nKāśyapa’s smile was a face-to-face acceptance.\nIf everyone laughed, it would mean the Dharma is universally equal,\nwith no distinctions of high or low.\nHe also said: *All plants and trees reveal the nature of perfect enlightenment,\nmountains and rivers manifest the body of the Dharma King.*\nIf everyone did not laugh, then rivers and streams would freeze solid,\ntheir waters unable to flow or drain.\nHe also said: *White clouds return to their caves,\nthe boundless sky blends into one hue.*\nThe monk bowed in understanding, thanked, and departed.\"\n\n「When the Teacher arrived at the Huayang Mountain Temple, a virtuous layman named Zhang Bingyi came to pay respects. He presented a *verse* titled *Western River Moon* and recited:\n\n*The love of parents is a single point of true essence,\nTheir bodies formed by the interplay of yin and yang.\nThey were manipulated by others for years upon end—\nStill unable to return my whole body to its source.\nToday I meet the Teacher’s guidance,\nAll past efforts were in vain.\n\nAt these words, he suddenly awakened—his mouth fell open in realization.\nAll thanks to the divine’s unseen grace.\n\nThe Teacher then continued:\n\n*\"The true essence is never obscured by a single point,\nYet it flows from mortal bones to immortal form.\nWho was it that manipulated me for years?\nWhy did I not recognize the power of speech and departure?\nI sought the Teacher’s guidance without true awakening—\nHow could my labor ever suffice?\nCease your idle chatter, do not open your mouth in vain—\nYour own divine essence silently protects you.*\n\nWhile staying in the quiet chamber of Huayang, a visitor asked: *\"How does one drink without becoming intoxicated?\"*\nThe Teacher replied: *\"One’s nature has its sovereign master—\nAlcohol cannot disrupt it.\"*\n\nThe visitor asked again: *\"What of feasts where music stirs the heart?\"*\nThe Teacher said: *\"Music is indeed joy—\nIt expands the five *zàng*-organs, easing their tension.*\nMaster Sun’s *Essay on Nourishing Life* states:\n*The spleen loves music; when it hears it, the spleen grinds away.*\n\nThe visitor pressed further: *\"Is worldly music the same as Daoist music?\"*\nThe Teacher replied: *\"Worldly music is the clash of *gōng*-scale, *shāng*-scale, *jué*-scale, *zhǐ*-scale, and *yǔ*-scale—\nThe sounds of Zheng and Wei, disrupting the ears and stirring the passions.\nDaoist music is the pure, external harmony,\nRighting the heart and calming the spirit.\n\nTo hear worldly music is to indulge in licentiousness,\nTo hear Daoist music is to harmonize *qi* and preserve true essence.\"*\n\nThe visitor asked: *\"What is Daoist music?\"*\nThe Teacher said: *\"It is the flute with no holes, the zither with no strings—\nThis music hums without striking, sounds without blowing.\nThe *Way*-Honored One says:\n*Five colors blind the eyes,\nFive tones deaf the ears.\nWith eyes blind, how can one gaze upon the Great Void?\nWith ears deaf, how can one hear Daoist music?*\n\nThe visitor rejoiced and bowed, then asked: *\"Do ordinary people make music, or do Daoists?\"*\nThe Teacher said: *\"Ordinary people indulge in licentious music,\nDaoists cultivate true joy and true music—\nNot reckless abandon.\nThe Daoist Master says:\n*True joy and true music come from drinking the essence of wisdom,\nNo need to buy—\nSinging the soundless melody of the heavens.*\n\nThe Teacher composed a poem:\n\n*\"Worldly music is not true music,\nDaoist harmony holds wondrous tones.\nOrdinary people favor worldly music,\nThe spirit reveres Daoist harmony most.\nWorldly music has limits,\nDaoist music knows no past or future.\nThe virtuous listen to Daoist music—\nIt must accord with Heaven’s will.\"*\n\nSomeone else asked: *\"What of the elixir of Inner Alchemy,\nThe refining process?\"*\nThe Teacher said: *\"Use the three *sān bān* substances—*jīng* (essence), *qì* (qi), and *shén* (spirit)—\nLet the *wén* (civil) and *wǔ* (martial) fires refine them,\nNot too much, not too little—\nBalance must be maintained.\nChild and mother must guard each other,\nReturning to the Yellow Palace.\nThen the Teacher composed a poem:\n\n*\"The elixir uses three refined substances,\nCollected within the cauldron to brew.\nRefined into priceless treasure,\nBright as the heavens, suspended in view.\"*\n\nWherever the Teacher wandered, he composed poems and songs to admonish the world—\n*Poems Against the World.*»\n\nThe world’s path is thick with mud and water—\nA slip will bring sure harm.\nDo not lightly set aside your staff,\nNor neglect to guard your steps.\n\nWalk ever the even Way,\nAvoid the steep and rugged heights.\nDo not sit beneath shade trees,\nFor cooling comes without fan.\n\n**To the Assembly:**\nThe Four Great Elements are like a house,\nThe Six Gates must stand firm.\nThe beams and foundations must be true,\nThe walls unbroken, complete.\nNo wild wind shall topple it,\nThe wisdom-lamp burns steadfastly.\n\nWhen the Master opens the true eye,\nHe sees the Heaven within the cave.\n\n**On the Brocade Screen Mountain:**\nThe Brocade Screen ever knows four seasons’ spring,\nUnstained by the world’s least speck of dust.\nThe Sage’s rinse drives back the waters of Heaven,\nThe Divine Wind rises—its chill invades.\nThe green pines know each other as friends,\nThe bright moon and pure wind as neighbors near.\nIn leisure’s quiet, sitting without artifice,\nUnwittingly, the spirit wanders to the Purple Court.\n\n**The Three Teachings Share One Source:**\nDao wears the scholar’s cap, Confucius the monk’s robe—\nThe Three Teachings have ever been one family.\nThe red lotus, white lotus roots, green leaves,\nGreen bamboo, yellow reeds, purple shoots.\nThough forms and garments differ in appearance,\nTheir roots and origins are not divided.\nThe Great Dao is true emptiness, undivided—\nHow could one tree bear two kinds of blossoms?\n\n**Exhortation:**\nDo not boast of fine craftsmanship like the *lou-luo*—\nEven when perfected, what good does it bring?\nThe sun at noon still bows low,\nThe moon past mid-autumn wanes.\nNow is the time to seek the path’s heights,\nLest you stumble into the winds and waves.\n\nWhat use are the Jade Hall or Golden Valley?\nIn the end, all is but a fleeting stain.\n\n**Self-Composed:**\nAn old rustic of the mountains, bowing to the village folk,\nMy coarse speech and trifles are unworthy mention.\nThough my vision dims, my heart remains clear,\nThough noise assails my ears, my nature stays undisturbed.\nThe simplicity of my home has its own flavor,\nThe realm of purity leaves no trace.\nIt is only because I have drained the marrow of emptiness\nThat I now see the Original Sage of Beginnings.\n\n**The Way of Walking:**\nA staff of cold iron drags in my hand,\nMy feet wander freely, without constraint.\n\n---\n\n**White Clouds:**\nWhite clouds are originally heartless things,\nTheir coming and going fear no distant peaks.\n\n**Residence:**\nGood and evil are both forgotten,\nAffairs are left unattended.\nWithout coming or going, serene and tranquil,\nOne rests in boundless peace.\n\nWithin this, a single spark of *Zhēnru* [真如] radiance,\nBrilliant and luminous, never concealed.\n**Sitting:**\nStable and unmoving, naturally pure and free,\nPreserving the time to cultivate the inner *Yán* [颜].\n\nNot like dead ashes or withered wood,\nA full moon shines upon my ancestral mountain.\n\n**Lying Down:**\nLetting go of the Four Great [大], attaining tranquil ease,\nLegs stretched long, sleeping soundly without tossing.\n\nOf late, I’ve learned the *Xīyí* [希夷] method,\nAt three in the morning, the sun ascends.\n\n**Pointing the Way:**\nThe ox calf stumbles across mountains and rivers,\nIts wisdom softened, gently led by the reins.\nWhen it turns back, bowing in submission,\nIt rests peacefully, nurturing its seed in the *Dāntián* [丹田].\n\n**Again:**\nThe monkey sleeps deeply, needing no pull,\nA fine horse returns, truly deserving the whip.\nGuarding the golden barrier to refine its nature,\nIt naturally transforms into a *Zǐjīnlián* [紫金莲].\n\n**Again:**\nThis spark of *Língguāng* [灵光] does not stray,\nOnly when clinging to memory does it sink into muddy plows.\nIf you can let go of dust and filth,\nThe *Xìngyuè* [性月] hangs high, illuminating the *Zǔjī* [祖基].\n\n**Again:**\nIf you still grasp at *Tàixū* [太虚] void,\nEvery head and object you’ll meet again.\nBeyond that hand, none can reach,\nAlone, one strides the *Miàogāofēng* [妙高峰].\n\n**Pills:**\nStrip away the skin, white as silver,\nRefine *Yīnyáng* [阴阳] forces evenly.\nWhen you meet me, don’t pass me by,\nLest you remain an ordinary hungry man.\n\n**Chestnuts:**\nLike thorns, their leaves like indigo,\nNot to be carelessly eaten by the common folk.\nWait until the *Tàixū* [太虚] Void smiles with an opening,\nAnd naturally, the *Zǐjīn Dān* [紫金丹] rolls out.\n\n**Net Basket:**\nNo drop stored, no wind invited,\nLifted clear—every pore open and bright.\nBy the teacher’s guidance, my whole body becomes eyes,\nThread by thread, piercing the *Tàixū* [太虚] Void.\n\n**Lantern Light:**\nA paper shield and bamboo frame surround,\nWithin, a flame burns crystal-clear.\nEight winds blow from all sides, yet none enter,\nIt reveals the people on the *Cháng’ān Dào* [长安道] below.\n\n**Black Soybeans:**\nSilently turn, leap out,\nNo lingering in the embers, buried long.\nStrip off the *Hēiqī* [黑漆] robe,\nA golden body manifests in its form.\n\n**Fan:**\nThe *Zhuāngshǒu* [匠手]’s palm lightly waves,\nFlames surge red within the furnace without effort.\n\n**Fly on the Window:**\nSeeking light, it flies and touches the paper,\nUnable to pass through, it hesitates in doubt.\nIf it turns back to its former path,\nSuddenly, it finds a way to escape.\n\n**Moth at the Lamp:**\nFor love of the red light, it deliberately flings itself,\nBurning its body, ruining its wings, yet never ceasing.\nRetreat a step, and there’s a cool, refreshing place—\nYet how can it stop its frantic circling?\n\n**Broom:**\nAlways close to its owner’s hand,\nMoment by moment, held firmly in grasp.\nA single sweep—clearly gone,\nThe *□Wáng* [□王] sits steady in the *Tàixū* [太虚] Void.\n\n**Cool Bamboo Umbrella:**\nA single green cloud raised overhead,\nNever leaving the hand that holds it aloft.\nSee how it shields those summer travelers,\nDust-choked and weary—\nThose who have it find their bodies and minds refreshed.\n\n**Shoes:**\nStep by step, they follow the Great Dao,\nNever sinking into mud or deep pits.\nSuddenly, they tread upon the ancestral path,\nAnd are cast off—this life’s end is tranquil.\n\n**Self-Composed (Chóngchāng) [中昌]:**\nWelcome the *Wèngxiān Kè* [迎仙客], #1\nA *Chūjiā* [出家] child, let your heart be firm.\nVisit the Dao, meditate early, and press forward.\nDo not be lazy, do not stray—\nA hundred years of life pass in a flash, changing your face.\nOnce you’ve left the home,\nSeek the *Xuán* [玄] early.\nDo not cling to the superficial, bound by karma.\nTame the *Mǎ* [马] of desire,\nLock the *Yuán* [猿] of mind.\nIn purity and stillness, you’ll see the face of the Original.\nYou who seek the Dao, hear my words:\nDo not delay year after year.\nAct swiftly, refine *Gǒng* [汞] and *Qiān* [铅].\nWhen the *Jīndān* [金丹] is complete,\nYou’ll ascend to the *Chángshēng Diàn* [长生殿].\n\nThe *Hùnyuán Zhū* [混元珠] is in everyone,\nBut without a clear teacher, you cannot act.\nDust obscures it—how can you discern?\nObtain it, and you’ll escape the suffering of countless kalpas.\nThe *Hùnyuán Zhū* [混元珠] is rarely recognized,\nOnly because you grow thorns of your own.\nKarma’s depths are thick—\nHard to exert effort.\nSeek a teacher early, and find the way to dissolve it.\nThis pearl does not stain with dust,\nWithin the twelve hours, it never leaves you.\nThrough merit, you move—\nNurturing *qì* [气] and spirit.\nSuddenly emerging,\nIt illuminates the Three Realms with radiance.\n\n**Full Court Joy (Mǎn Tíng Fāng):**\nThis little lamp of the heart,\nWind cannot extinguish—\nEverlasting through time and eternity.\nFools cannot see it,\nAnd in darkness, they cannot walk.\nNo need for clear oil or yellow wax,\nIt can brighten and illuminate all.\nDo you know?\nAll because of clinging to phenomena,\nYou’ve lost the original path.\nNow I speak it plain—\nDo not seek it outside,\nRefine it within, and balance it evenly.\nWhere the *Huìfēng* [慧风] arises,\nClouds scatter, and the sky clears.\nThe sun’s brilliance spreads everywhere,\nDemons of darkness are extinguished—\nThe Great Dao is complete.\nEver shining and radiant,\nIt breaks through darkness,\nAnd saves all beings universally.\n\n**The Happy Relocation of the Oriole (Xǐqiān Yīng):**\nPerfect clarity is inherently complete.\n\n**The Song of Nurturing the True and Preserving Life:**\n\n*Ah, how the foolish fail to awaken!*\n*Lost in their own delusion, they wander blind.*\n*Clinging to dusty passions,*\n*They spin through upside-down rebirth—*\n*When will they dare to withdraw and turn back?*\n*This spark of original luminosity,*\n*Each one knows not whence it came.*\n*Lost in the true delight—*\n*They mistake thorns for the sacred *língchūn* [灵椿],*\n*The immortal path obscured.*\n*Rolling through depths of despair,*\n*When will the heart open to truth?*\n*Today’s youthful bloom,*\n*By tomorrow may vanish—*\n*Do not squander life in idle dreams.*\n*Swiftly seek the true now,*\n*Lest fleeting dust defile it.*\n\n*The body must stand firm,*\n*Then the Great Dao’s path is steady and sure.*\n*To cultivate the true and nourish life,*\n*I speak to those who study the *Xuánmén* [玄门]:*\n*With urgency, turn back and save yourselves!*\n*One hundred years pass like a blink of the eye—*\n*What then of this fragile flesh, where to rely?*\n*To lose the *yángshén* [阳神],*\n*Becomes a *yīngguǐ* [阴鬼]—*\n*No end to the trade of bones in endless cycles.*\n*This life is no trifle—*\n*Do not cast it lightly to death!*\n*What is *shén* [神], what is *mìng* [命]?*\n*The two—*qi* and spirit—are the root of all.*\n*Gather them home as one,*\n*Soon you’ll silently commune with sages.*\n\n*The way of cultivation is simple,*\n*Only forget the world and subdue the *shuìmó* [睡魔].*\n*When the mind is still and clear,*\n*The spirit knows no dimness—*\n*Nurture the true body to emerge from *suōpó* [娑婆].*\n*Do not extinguish the inner flame,*\n*Gradually enter the gate of endless life.*\n\n*The essence is like oil,*\n*The light like spirit,*\n*The *qi* like a lamp’s flame,*\n*The body like its burner.*\n*When oil is full and flame brightens,*\n*The heart stands pure and clear—*\n*Then you’ll see the truth, the lamp’s true owner.*\n*If one is lost, the other falters,*\n*In endless darkness you’ll waste your years.*\n*Coming to this treasure mountain empty-handed,*\n*You’ve lost the coins once spent to buy your life.*\n\n*Awake, listen to me:*\n*When *héhé* [和合] is one, no lack remains.*\n*Refine the *jīndān* [金丹] with a thousand days’ labor,*\n*And death’s cycles will all be pierced.*\n*Cast off the mortal frame,*\n*Exchange for the *xiān gǔ* [仙骨],*\n*The golden-maned lion emerges from its cave.*\n*One radiance shines through the boundless void,*\n*Not consorting with foxes in their schemes.*\n*The *Fǎwáng* [法王]’s seed is no hard task,*\n*But foxes remain worlds apart.*\n*Respect and trust the worthy masters,*\n*Test their teachings now—*\n*In time, you’ll surely join the ranks of immortals.*\n\n**The Song of Self-Lament:**\n\n*Since leaving the world’s dust,*\n*My heart has ever been as one.*\n*I vowed to awaken in the *Xuánmén* [玄门],*\n*To rescue the drowned in the ocean of desire.*\n*At first, it was hard to begin,*\n*Yet I wandered reckless, in and out.*\n*Just to have a free body is called the Dao—*\n*How could I know that such folly invites rebirth’s woe?*\n*Suddenly still, then insight breaks,*\n*The monastery’s gruel now tastes like nectar.*\n*Though I’ve left the world, my heart remains—*\n*If the heart does not leave, all is the same.*\n*With resolve firm and thoughts sharp,*\n*I sought teachers and paths without rest.*\n*On a mid-autumn night, deep and still,*\n*The Master warned me with tender words:*\n*Thank the Master for his guidance,*\n*Now act with lightness and truth.*\n*Though I’ve drifted through the years,*\n*Still I’ve not found the art of endless life.*\n*Crossing mountains and rivers,*\n*Always anxious, always longing—*\n*Till I reached *Xiāoshān* [萧山] by chance,*\n*Where the White Cloud Master recognized me.*\n*His words struck like thunder,*\n*Yet in my darkness, I found their power.*\n*All past deeds were overturned,*\n*No longer did I seek elsewhere.*\n*Walking, sitting—no matter,*\n*Moving or resting, free from care.*\n*Twenty years as a poor man,*\n*Now I hold the treasure within my body.*\n*The paper screen is shattered,*\n*In boundless ease, I follow *yuán* [缘] as it flows.*\n*Others cling to countless bonds,*\n*Eating when hungry, sleeping when weary.*\n*Reflecting now on past words,*\n*I sought to use the *miàodiǎn* [妙典] as my boat.*\n*Yet how many drowned souls*\n*Chase waves in sorrow—*\n*No turning back, no guiding hand,*\n*Shallow fate, no *yīnyuán* [因缘] to pierce the depths.*\n*This boat passed—no more shall come,*\n*Another day, the winds and tides will part.*\n*Wasted paper, wasted tongue,*\n*No man will dare to act with resolve.*\n*Only to beg for idle words,*\n*While eyes bleed in vain thought.*\n*What filth, what filth—*\n*Better return and seal the lips.*\n*When fate and chance align,*\n*From emptiness, I’ll lift the *yúnshǒu* [云手].*\n*Cease, cease, cease—*\n*Draw a line to all good and ill.*\n*Better guard this life’s pearl,*\n*Let its light deter even *shén guǐ* [神鬼].*\n*Silence now, silence—*\n*Lest idle chatter waste your breath.*\n*Few in this world know true harmony,*\n*So I’ll keep my folly in the lonely cliffs.*\n\n*After years of wandering,*\n*Now I’ve cast off the fishing boat.*\n*Let the great waves rise as they will,*\n*In the depths of reeds, I’ll hide my head.*\n\n**The Song of Lethargy:**\n\n*All worldly affairs, past and present,*\n*I’ve seen through—*\n*Yet still I teach the heart to be lazy.*\n*Let others chase fame and fortune,*\n*I’ll not lift my gaze to see.*\n*You rush, I sit—*\n*As they come and go, like turning a millstone.*\n*Who will let the busy rest?*\n*In stillness lies the true labor.*\n*Not lazy, but I love simplicity,*\n*Though men mock me for my plainness.*\n*Just for this plainness I find peace,*\n*And pierce the *xiàngmén* [项门] to open the true eye.*\n*Laziness hides labor,*\n*Labor hides laziness—*\n*Though both dwell in this world, they’re not the same.*\n*Each day the *héchē* [河车] moves,*\n*Three gates struck—*qi* swirls thick.*\n*The true path walks, the crooked stops,*\n*Where others delight, I find no joy.*\n*If you’ll walk where I now tread,*\n*You’ll align with the *tiānlǐ* [天理].*\n*No need to cultivate without,*\n*Only seek within—*\n*Like the pearl hidden in the oyster’s shell.*\n*When the shell cracks, dust scatters,*\n*Its light shines clear, unobstructed.*\n*Stillness in motion, motion in stillness,*\n*Suddenly—wide open, the white jade cave.*\n*Clouds of illusion drift away,*\n*The moon stands clear in the sky—*\n*Seizing the void, turning it inside out.*\n*Moving or resting—both are ease,*\n*Yet in motion and stillness, joy is found.*\n\nThe world mocks me for my foolish laziness,\nYet through laziness, I leap beyond the gates of strife.\nThe Dao is wordless, originally unsaid—\nThus I conceal my light, feigning clumsy ignorance.\n\nSkillful craft is not as good as hiding its brilliance,\nPreserving the luminous so it never fades.\nOuter brightness pales to the light wrapped within—\nNurture it whole, and the Way itself takes form.\n\nAwait the thunderous crack of spring’s bolt,\nPiercing through Penglai’s ten thousand leagues.\n\n---\n**Praise to the *Zhēndé Zhēnjīng* (True Scripture of the Dao and Virtue)**\nFive thousand characters, each line and phrase\nResonates with profound mystery.\nIf a student grasps this truth,\nNo need to ride the *luán* [鸾] to the Ninth Heaven.\n\n---\n**Praise to the *Fǎhuá Miàndiǎn* (Sutra of the Lotus Flower of the Fine Dharma)**\nOver sixty thousand words, each crystal-clear,\nPiercing the Three Realms, shattering the dark.\nIf a student seeks to transcend birth and death,\nIt lies entirely within the Lotus’s seven scrolls.\n\n---\n**Further Praise**\nThis true scripture, the *Mìfǎhuá* (Mysterious Lotus Sutra),\nIllustrates the three chariots of the fire-house—\nSweeping away filth, the pearl reveals itself,\nAnd turning over, one arrives at the Law-King’s realm.\n\n---\n**Praise to the *Qīngjìng Jīng* (Scripture of Serenity and Stillness)**\nThe Most High’s golden mouth speaks profound truth,\nIlluminating the Way, banishing all dust.\nIf a student follows its teaching and forgets self,\nThey become a being of Penglai’s cave.\n\n---\n**Praise to the *Bōrě Xīnjīng* (Heart Sutra of Perfect Wisdom)**\nThis Heart Sutra dwells within the heart itself—\nThe lost seek it vainly beyond.\nIf one sets it down with total ease,\nInstantly, the earth turns to gold.\n\n---\n**Farewell to the Assembly**\nEight decades of illusion, a transformed body—\nToday I depart, shedding mortal dust.\nI bow to all Daoist friends of the Mysterious Gate,\nEach must endure, preserving the True.\n\n---\n**Departure from the World**\nThe Four Great Elements are borrowed, not enduring,\nTemporarily gathered in the dust-world to form ties.\nNow my ties exhausted, I return to emptiness—\nWhen next will I pass on the ancient teachings?\n\nIce melts, snow thaws—still water remains,\nForm perishes, spirit departs—returning to the Mysterious.\nIf asked where my home lies,\nI still return to the *Xiàngdì* [象帝] first.\n\n---\n*Suímáiyìnghuà Lù* (Record of Spontaneous Transformation) Volume Lower ends

Two volumes.\nSource text: *Canonical Daoist Canon (Zhengtong Daozang)*, **Taixuan (Great Mystery) Section**.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Record of Spontaneous Transformation in Accordance with Circumstances* by the Pure One**\nThere was a **Quanzhen Daoist** of the Shaanxi region, whose ancestral home was in **Zhejiang’s Simin** (Four Mings). His father resided in **Qiantang**, where **Master He Daoquan** was born. From his youth, the Master cultivated the Dao, taking the name **Wugouzi** (the Unstained One), and wandered the lands by the **East Sea**. Few took note of him at the time. Later, he journeyed westward to **Zhongnan Mountain**, dwelling in the ruins of **Guifeng Peak**, where his cultivation reached fulfillment. The people marveled at this, and it is recorded in inscriptions.\n\nIn the **Mengcheng** month of the **Jisi year of Hongwu** (1379), the Master passed away in a **Long’an medical hall**. Noble officials bestowed upon him the rites of **ascension**, and he was interred in the **graveyard of the Immortals**.\n\nTwo years later, **Sun Shoutongzi** (Master Sun, the Longevity Communicator) arrived, speaking thus: *\"I had long known Master He, but now he has departed—there is no longer any hope of seeing him again.\"* Alas, how lofty was Master He’s spirit! He bowed respectfully and entreated me, *\"I beg you to compose a preface for this work.\"*\n\nI sighed and replied: *\"The Dao cannot be made manifest through mere description; one must record its true practice. Though my learning is meager, I shall strive to express it in words.\"* Indeed, in both past and present, those who aspire to the Dao often fail to grasp its ultimate essence. Yet Master He penetrated the principles of **nature and fate**, embodying the teaching of **non-action**, so that even common folk revered his transformation. How could this be, unless his innate purity was profound?\n\n**Jia Daoxuan** was Master He’s disciple. Carrying medicine, he traveled a thousand miles without fatigue, determined to complete this record. Without Master Sun’s request, I would not have undertaken this work. Yet Master Sun’s Dao is now manifest, and Master He’s Dao is also manifest—like matching seals. Since Master He’s passing, without Master Sun, the **orthodox teaching** would have no one to transmit it. Though Master Sun was younger, he revered Master He, and now, after his departure, he further illuminates his legacy. This alone reveals Master He’s **virtue**.\n\nTheir bond was profound. The compilation of this **language record** was Master He’s own work, completed before his death, and it holds great significance for the teaching. This was written on the **sixth day of the sixth month, Xinyi year of Hongwu** (1381), by **Kunqiu Lingtongzi** (the Responsive Sage of Kunqiu).\n\n---\n**Volume One of the *Record of Spontaneous Transformation in Accordance with Circumstances***\nNarrated by **Master He Daoquan, the Pure One of Songxi**\nCompiled by his disciple **Jia Daoxuan**.",

      "translated_text": "**The Way Manifests**\n\nMaster [He Daoquan] journeyed away from Zhe, wandering through Huai and Chu, arriving at the True Martial Hall by the Red Lotus Lake in Muyang. There, he encountered an old Daoist friend reclining in high spirits, who exclaimed, *\"The Pure One of Songxi has come to visit—let us mix the clay with the disciples!\"*\n\nThe old friend, Gao, laughed, *\"These past few years, the Pure One has been dragging himself through mud and water.\"*\n\nMaster replied, *\"He knows only that lotus roots grow in the mud, but does not see that lotus flowers bloom when they rise above the water.\"*\n\nGao asked, *\"What relation does the lotus root bear to the lotus flower? How can their forms be compared?\"*\n\nMaster answered, *\"The lotus root symbolizes the human body. The lotus flower represents the true nature of the heart. A Daoist and a common person may respond to affairs in the same way, but it is in the mind’s essence that they differ. Thus, I composed a verse:*\n\n*'The void itself sets no dust in motion,\nOuter forms are false, yet the core is true.\nOnly the lotus root knows how to thrive in stagnant mud,\nNever has it seen the lotus flower’s fresh emergence from the water.'*\n\nMaster then traveled westward, crossing the Yellow River, and reached the humble hermitage of Master Zhan. While conversing with an aged monk, a novice arrived to listen to the teachings.\n\nThe aged monk said, *\"There is no law to expound.\"*\n\nMaster replied, *\"This is the true expounding of the Way! Have you not heard the *Diamond Sutra* say: ‘Without law to expound, this is called expounding the law’?\"*\n\nThe Confucian scholar remarked, *\"Though the Way transcends the senses of hearing and sight, one cannot truly escape their use.\"*\n\nLong ago, when **Subhuti** reclined in meditation among the cliffs, the heavenly hosts showered him with flowers, saying, *\"We see the Honorable One skillfully expounding Prajna [Wisdom].\"*\n\nThe Honorable One replied, *\"I have never uttered a single word about Prajna.\"*\n\nThe heavenly hosts said, *\"If the Honorable One does not speak, then we have not heard either. Without speech and without hearing, this is the true Prajna.\"*\n\nThe *Thunder Ancestor Sutra* states: *\"If you wish to hear the supreme Way, the supreme Way is profound and distant—it lies not in other things. Since you desire to hear it, then ‘without hearing’ is the Way itself.\"*\n\nThose who study the Way must be sincere and gentle, keeping silent and guarding themselves, only then can they enter the Way.\n\nThe novice further inquired about the meaning of *‘middle.’*\n\nMaster said, *\"Wherever thoughts arise, that is the middle—this is the Daoist understanding of ‘middle.’\"*\n\nThe Buddhist [monk] explained, *\"Neither clinging to good nor to evil—when the mind is just and clear, that is your original face, this is the Buddhist understanding of ‘middle.’\"*\n\nThe Confucian scholar said, *\"The state before the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight manifest is called ‘middle’—this is the Confucian understanding of ‘middle.’ You should ponder this.\"*\n\nMaster arrived at the Ning An hermitage in **Pingning**, where **Zhang An** was the primary attendant seeking his guidance.",

into birds—why is that?\"*\n\nMaster replied, *\"Consider the peach pit,\nhanging in empty space without rooting in earth—\nhow could it sprout and grow into a tree?\"*\n\nThe *Sutra of the Beginning of Writing (文始经)* states:\n*\"All seeds within the soil,\nby the transformative power of heaven and earth, sprout into life.\nThe sprouts grow into trees,\nthe trees then blossom with flowers,\nthe flowers wither into fruit,\nthe fruit ripens into seeds,\nthe seeds return to sprouts,\nthe sprouts return to trees—\nseeds and sprouts mutually generating,\ntheir changes extending countless billions of trees,\nendless without end.*\n\n*If a seed hangs suspended in the void,\nuntouched by any boundary or side,\nnot dwelling within the earth,\nthough heaven and earth be vast,\nthey cannot transform the seed in emptiness\nto sprout and grow into a tree.*\n\n*Moreover, when yin and yang unite,\nthe transformative power of heaven and earth produces birds,\nthe birds then lay eggs,\nthe eggs and birds mutually generating—\ntheir changes extending countless billions of birds,\nendless without end.*\n\n*If an egg lacks the yang (雄),\nthough yin and yang be wondrous,\nthey cannot transform it—\nthis is pure yin without yang.*\n\n*As the ancients said:\nPure yang unmixed becomes a **xian (仙)**,\nyin and yang harmonized create all things,\npure yin without yang becomes a **gui (鬼)**.*\n\n*Emperor Yin (尹真君)* declared:\n*\"Those who have not yet harmed me,\nI subdue with a single breath—\nthen they transform into all things.\nAmong the Five Phases (五行),\nwho can resist my transformation?\"*\n\n*For those who cultivate the Way,\nwhen encountering phenomena,\nthey must pass through lightly and swiftly—\nall afflictions must not be clung to or suppressed.\nIf they are bound by myriad things,\nand cling to objects, they will be transformed by them,\nensnared by yin and yang,\ntheir thoughts shifting with each circumstance—\nthus they fall into the cycle of rebirth and wanderings in samsara.*\n\n*If even a thread of thought arises,\nthey must immediately subdue it.\nIf they can extinguish thoughts and forget emotions,\nall afflictions will cease,\nand yin and yang will no longer forge them.*\n\n*Like a seed suspended in the void,\nan egg without yang,\noutside the Six Coalescences (六合之内),\nreturning to the primordial origin—\nthis is no small matter.*\n\nMaster then arrived at the **Youde Temple (佑德观)** in **Nazhou (那州)**,\nwhere **Master Xiuju (秀聚峰)** sought his guidance.\n\nThe monk asked about the phrase *\"reciting the Buddha (念佛).\"*\n\nMaster said, *\"Why seek so far?\nHow could you not recognize your own Buddha?\"*\n\n*\"If you were to invite the Western Buddha to come,\nwhere would you place your own family’s Buddha?\"*\n\n*\"Have you not heard the Old One of the River say:\nIf you claim he is the Buddha,\nyou yourself become a demon (魔).\"*\n\n*The Daoists say:\nWithin your body lies the true **Primordial Origin (真元始)**,\nwhy seek the **Celestial Sovereign (天尊)** outside your mind?\"*\n\n*The Confucians say:\nMy body itself contains a **Great Ultimate (太极).\"***\n\nThe monk further asked, *\"Please, Master, reveal the swift path of reciting the Buddha—\nhow can one attain the Buddha’s true face?\"*\n\nMaster laughed and said, *\"I tell you:\nThe ancients said,\n‘Recite the Buddha once, respond once—\nthe original face is made utterly clear.\nWithout the mind, a staff strikes the peach pit—\nit startles even the encased spirit within.’*\n\n*This is breaking open the Buddha’s true face.*\n\n*Moreover, the path of reciting the Buddha has three levels:\nFirst, subduing demons;\nsecond, visualization;\nthird, inquiry and investigation.*\n\n*None of these three stages depend on counting the beads of recitation.*\n\n*For those who first begin reciting the Buddha,\nthey must first recite the Buddha to subdue demons.\nWhen the demons are suppressed and thoughts extinguished,\nonly then do they enter the path.*\n\n*If not so,\nthey waste their **spirit and qi (神气)**,\nand will never succeed.*\n\n*What is crucial is subduing demons and extinguishing thoughts—\nwhen reciting the Buddha,\ndo not let even a thread of thought arise.\nTreat all stray thoughts as the true object,\nand strive to replace your dull heart with the Buddha’s heart.*\n\n*If your foundation is shallow,\nand you cannot swiftly replace it,\nthen reflect within yourself:\n‘I am one who recites the Buddha—\nwhy do these thoughts arise?\nThey are the roots of my past karma.’*\n\n*Thus, holding yourself in restraint,\ngradually raise the Buddha’s name,\nfrom one to ten voices,\nor even to a hundred.\nDo not let stray thoughts interrupt—\nif thoughts arise, sweep them away;\nif no thoughts arise, raise the recitation.*\n\n*The former Master said:\n‘Thoughts within no-thoughts,\nno-thoughts within thoughts—\nthis is the way.’*\n\n*With time and practice,\na natural understanding will emerge.\nSimply recite the Buddha in all your movements and stillness,\nnever ceasing.*\n\n*If your thoughts do not stray,\nand you never forget the recitation,\nuntil it reaches the point where you do not raise it yet it is raised,\nno-thoughts yet thoughts arise—\nthen you have attained its power.*\n\n*Thus, reciting the Buddha,\nyou will later bear good fruit.*\n*If evil thoughts are many,\nand your mouth recites while your heart does not—\nthis is creating karma,\nknown as the **‘Buddha’s mouth, serpent’s heart (佛口蛇心).’***\n\n*For those who practice reciting the Buddha through visualization,*\n*in all your movements and stillness,\nspeech and silence,*\n*visualize the Buddha at every moment—\nthis is not done aloud.*\n\n*The Buddha does not leave your heart,\nyour heart does not leave the Buddha—\nlike mother and child remembering each other.*\n\n*If even a fleeting thought of phenomena arises,\nimmediately gather the scene into your heart\nand use it as your visualization.*\n\n*Within your own heart is a single true Buddha,\nwith a purple flame and golden form,\nseated in majesty—\ntowering and unmoving.*\n\n*Never abandon this moment,\nvisualize and recite at every thought—\nwhether in thousands or hundreds of recitations,*\n*the Buddha appears before you.*\n\n*When facing adverse or favorable circumstances,\nor demonic obstacles,*\n*sweep them all away with one mind,\nvisualizing and reciting the Buddha:*\n*Amitābha Buddha (阿弥陀佛) is the sovereign master—\nlike leaning on Mount Sumeru,*\n*or clutching a pillar in a

      "translated_text": "A Daoist disciple, Master Liu Zonghai, asked the Teacher: *\"What does it mean to cultivate and refine?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"To cultivate is to refine one’s outward conduct; to refine is to temper one’s body and mind. Cultivating outward conduct means caring for orphans and widows, respecting the elderly and pitying the poor, building bridges and roads, aiding the afflicted and resolving difficulties—these amount to eight hundred practices. Refining body and mind means dwelling in stillness, guarding the environment, tempering the body and refining the mind, conserving essence and nurturing *qi*, refining the spirit and returning to emptiness—these amount to three thousand practices. Cultivating outward conduct generates *virtue*; refining inwardly generates *wisdom*. When both *virtue* and *wisdom* are complete, one transcends birth and death.\"*\n\nAgain, [the disciple asked]: *\"Why is it that a man of sixty-four cannot cultivate his life?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"Humans are the most refined of all things, with a natural lifespan of forty-three thousand two hundred days. Their spirit comprises thirty-six thousand units, their original *yang* and true *qi* weigh three hundred eighty-four *liǎng*. This corresponds internally to *Qián* [乾]. If one fails to preserve and nurture it, allowing it to dissipate, then one perishes prematurely in midlife. *Qián* is the fullness of six *yang* energies, yet one does not yet know how to act or apply them. To know this and practice refinement is to become an immortal.\n\nFrom fifteen to twenty-five years old, if one’s emissions and expenditures do not cease, the true *qi* diminishes by forty-eight *liǎng*, leaving what corresponds to *Jiǔ* [姤]. If one’s desires grow excessive, another ten years pass, and the *qi* diminishes another forty-eight *liǎng*, leaving what corresponds to *Dùn* [遁]. If one still fails to preserve and nurture it, another ten years pass, and the *qi* diminishes another forty-eight *liǎng*, leaving what corresponds to *Pǐ* [否]. At this point, one reaches the central *qi* of heaven and earth. If one still does not practice cultivation, another ten years pass, and the *qi* diminishes by seventy-two *liǎng*, corresponding to *Guān* [观]. If one still fails to supplement and nourish it, another five years pass, and the *qi* diminishes by ninety-six *liǎng*, leaving what corresponds to *Bō* [剥]. If one still does not preserve and nurture it, at sixty-four—the completion of the sixty-four *guà*—the original *qi* is exhausted, corresponding internally to *Kūn* [坤]. *Kūn* is pure *yin*; one survives only by relying on the *qi* of grains, hence the name *gǒushòu* [苟寿, \"barely alive\"]. At this stage, death is near, and one can no longer refine the elixir. Those whose decline is even more severe may perish before this point, like an old tree struck by great winds or fire—its withering and death are inevitable.\n\nAll who practice must understand the measure of *liǎng* and adjust their efforts accordingly. The Ancestral Teacher said: *‘One gourd contains three hundred eighty-four liǎng*—this is what is meant.’*\n\nA disciple named Chen asked about the *shījiě* [尸解, \"corpse resolution\"] method.\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"There are five types of *shījiě*: those resolved by sword, text, water, fire, and *tài-yīn* [太阴]. Sword-resolution is like Guo Pu being executed in the marketplace, Zhou Pu being sawn apart. Text-resolution is like Zhang Lang’s form appearing on a staff, Bodhidharma departing with a single sandal. Water-resolution is like Feng Yi drowning in the great river, Tai Bai sinking into the depths. Fire-resolution is like Feng Zhi burning beneath a fire tree, Lu Xian ascending from a thatched hut. *Tài-yīn* resolution is when the corpse’s color does not change, the flesh does not turn green, the skin does not wrinkle, the eyes retain their luster, and the limbs remain supple—this too is *shījiě*. The flesh does not decay for a hundred years, and the body can rise again as a living person. Though such is the case, one still does not attain the Dao of the Heavenly Immortal—only non-death is achieved.\"*\n\nThat year, in the ninth month of the *bǐngyín* [丙寅] year, the Teacher arrived at the East Peak of Huayang and stayed at the Xiexian Temple. Catching rain leaking through the roof, he composed a poem:\n\n---\n*The roof leaks, yet I do not leak;\nOthers are busy, yet I am not.\nI shift to where my body rests secure,\nAnd all worldly thoughts dissolve.*\n\nOn the fifteenth of that month, the Full Truth Daoists Dong Gūyún, Wang Yíshān, and Hé Lǎnyún departed for the Wànshòu Palace in Dānyáng to perform the *zhǔbō* [主钵, \"main alms ceremony\"], composing a poem as they took leave:\n\n---\n*Deep mountains and secluded valleys are my home,\nA life of simplicity I hold in pride.\nMy clay bowl ever holds honeyed wine,\nMy porcelain pot brews tea from *gòuyá* leaves.\nAt leisure, I point to the moon beyond the sky,\nIn boredom, I gaze upon flowers by the stream.\nToday I bid farewell to friends and depart—\nGazing afar at forests and valleys, sighing in vain.*\n\nAt that time, on the twenty-second of the ninth month, they arrived at the Wànshòu Palace in Dānyáng. A military commander named Deng paid his respects to the Teacher, saying: *\"I have long heard of your Dao, Master.\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"I merely dwell in the mountains, nurturing my simplicity.\"*\n\nThe commander said: *\"If one could truly grasp this ‘simplicity,’ one would have cultivated the Dao to its fullest.\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"To conceal one’s light and hide one’s brilliance, to reveal one’s true nature and embrace simplicity—though eloquent, one speaks not; though skilled, one appears clumsy. The eyes do not perceive colors, the ears do not hear sounds, though the mouth responds to affairs, the heart harbors no desires. The heart has no heart; within thought, there is no thought. This is how I nurture my simplicity.\"*\n\nThe commander asked: *\"What are the meanings of *xìng* [性, nature] and *mìng* [命, fate/life]?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"Nature is the substance of life; life is the function of nature. Without substance, function lacks clarity; without function, substance lacks completeness. Root and branch are inherently connected—yet for convenience, we divide them into two.\"*\n\nThe commander asked: *\"If nature and life are inherently unified, why divide them?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"Nature and life are originally one, but desires separate them. The ancients said: *‘Wood and metal divide the hare and rabbit’*—this is so.\"*\n\nThe commander asked: *\"How does nature relate to the Dao?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"It is like the analogy of the Golden Elixir. True nature endures through kalpas, unobstructed in entering or exiting, hence it is compared to gold in firmness, steel in sharpness, and the elixir in perfection. Zhongyang Di Jun said:\n*‘True nature is called the Golden Elixir;\nFour false forms are the furnace to refine it into a sphere.\nUnstained, unthinking, free of delusion—\nNaturally it rolls forth to the Immortal Platform.’*\nThis is it.\"*\n\nThe next day, the assembly completed their inquiries.",

The encircled space is the meaning of returning to the origin and restoring the root—nothing more than cultivating stillness.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"There are three thousand six hundred teachings; which one do you follow?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"I have received the Master’s oral instructions, which lie beyond the count of three thousand six hundred.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Do you mean an esoteric path?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"The Master said: ‘Four walls without openings, eight directions without gates—\nThe Great Dao is boundless, and void cannot measure it.\nBecause disciples vary in wisdom and folly,\nGreat and small vehicles arise.\nThis is the heart’s own deviation; the Great Dao knows no contrary or conforming.’\nSince disciples differ in virtue and wisdom, and in depth of roots,\nthe sages established these three teachings to accommodate their capacities.\nThe term *vehicle* means a means of conveyance—\nlike a large cart carrying heavy goods,\na medium cart carrying medium goods,\nand a small cart carrying light goods.\nThey raise disciples according to their sharpness or dullness of understanding—\nthis is the sages’ teaching adapted to each circumstance.\nThe *use* may vary in three ways, but the *Dao* remains one.\nThe ancients said: ‘Waters flow in different streams,\nyet all return to the same source—\nhow could there be any division?’\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Master Dong’s principle of sitting in the encircled space—\nyou must know it?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"The Master once spoke of the principles of dead encircled space and living encircled space.\nThe dead encircled space is when four walls surround you,\nand the sitter remains inside, sealing the door to prevent exit or entry,\nreceiving meals at set times.\nOne must settle the body, extinguish thoughts,\ncalm the *qi*, and harmonize the spirit.\nAfter a hundred days, they emerge—\nthose with resolve make progress,\nwhile those without may fall ill instead.\nThe living encircled space is when the four great elements are falsely formed into walls,\nand jade seals and golden locks serve as barriers.\nA single spark of luminous consciousness remains within,\nnever dimmed, moment by moment.\nThe spirit does not leave the *qi*, nor does the *qi* leave the spirit.\nInternal thoughts do not escape, external thoughts do not intrude.\nAmidst chaos, one finds stillness;\nstillness contains clarity.\nThe spirit guards internally, undisturbed by the outside.\nThus, a hundred days here surpass a thousand days in dead encircled space.\nThe dead encircled space restrains the form but fails to nourish the spirit—\neven if it controls the mind, it is forced and artificial,\nlike caging a monkey or tethering a horse.\nRemoving the cage or rope, they remain as wild and flawed as before—\nthis is not natural.\nIf one can instead refine the heart through interaction with all things,\nit is better than external artificial restraint.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"How does one refine the heart through interaction with all things?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"When one sees all kinds of beings,\nnot loving them means not being attached to things;\nwhen one encounters all kinds of circumstances,\nremaining unmoved means not being swayed by them.\nThrough such prolonged refinement,\none attains the three *dhyānas* of no-mind—\nin stillness, one does not move;\nin motion, one does not move—\nthis is the true stillness, the true *dhyāna*.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"From ancient times, even immortals have practiced sitting in the encircled space—\nwhy is that?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"The early sages sat in the encircled space,\nnot because they had not attained enlightenment,\nbut because later disciples, seeing forms and stirred by emotions,\nhearing sounds and moved by thoughts,\nneeded a hundred days of seclusion to keep their minds from chaos.\nThus, they set an example for later generations,\na convenient method to teach disciples how to cultivate and achieve success,\nreturning to the origin and restoring the root.\nEven as Bodhidharma came from the West,\nsat facing the wall at Shaolin for nine years,\nand received the transmission of *shen guang* (神光),\nthe Master was not yet unenlightened—\nall was done to establish a model for later disciples.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Today, there are still those who sit facing the wall—\nwhy do they not attain enlightenment?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"They only know how to adorn the external forms,\nnot recognizing the true essence within.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"What is the meaning of ‘covering the head to create transformation’?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"Covering the head teaches one to contain their thoughts,\nfacing the wall means seeing without seeing—\nit is also turning away from external circumstances and focusing inward.\nThe *Observing the Dao Sutra* says: ‘Do not see what is desirable,\nso the heart does not become disordered.’\nThe cultivator must not let the eyes perceive colors,\nnor the ears listen to sounds.\nSeeing without seeing, hearing without hearing—\ncutting off sounds and colors, eliminating thoughts and worries.\nOnly adorning the external form brings no lasting benefit.\"*\n\n**Master Lü** said:\n*\"To shatter the illusion of void perception,\nthen the

      "translated_text": "Someone asked: *\"If there is awareness and illumination, does it not inevitably cling to phenomena as they arise?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied:\n*\"Even though the lamp’s light illuminates narrowly,\nits flame never strays from the stand.\nHe then composed a poem:*\n*The myriad sounds of wind are void of sentiment,\nthe thousand rivers reflect the moon’s equal light.\nPhenomena, from the start, bear no stain or attachment—\nmountains stand majestic, waters flow freely.*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"What then is the Dao?\"*\n\nThe Teacher said: *\"Where the Five Phases do not reach,\nand before the single *qi* arises—there it is.\"*\n\nAgain, someone asked: *\"Where does the Dao reside for those who cultivate?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"Where good and evil are both forgotten,\nand before a single thought takes form—\nin the depths of stillness and silence,\none attains the Dao.\"*\n\nAgain, someone asked: *\"How does one cultivate and nourish oneself to reach this state?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"One must integrate the essence and function.\"*\n\nAgain, someone asked: *\"What is the essence and function?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"The function of the Dao is to bring peace to people and benefit all things;\nthe essence of the Dao must be in non-action and tranquility.\nIf one can subdue their thoughts and not let them arise,\nnaturally, they will be tranquil and without action.\nAll who do not stir their thoughts—\nneither praise nor blame takes root,\nanger nor joy oversteps—\nthese are the ones who guard the Dao.\"*\n\nAgain, someone asked: *\"Are there matters of Heavenly Rewards and Hellish Punishments?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"If there is no Heavenly Reward, then there is none;\nif there is, it is for the virtuous to ascend.\nIf there is no Hellish Punishment, then there is none;\nif there is, it is for the wicked to descend.\nThe Dao scriptures say:\n‘No fear of imprisonment in life,\nno suffering of annihilation after death.’\nUnder the current sacred governance,\nrewarding virtue and punishing evil—\nthis is Heavenly Reward and Hellish Punishment.\nThe ancient sages spoke of countless teachings and doctrines,\nwith loyalty and filial piety as foremost.\nIn both heaven and earth,\nconvenience is the first principle.\"*\n\nA disciple presented a poem to the Teacher, who then composed a reply:\n*\"A pair of fire-sinews, all of steel throughout.\nPiercing straight through, they guide both action and retreat.\nNever leaving the furnace and stove,\nthey come and go, ever in attendance.\nWithdrawing and adding, clustered and refined,\nflames blaze bright in a thousand hues.\nDispelling all hidden darkness,\nforging pure yang.\nCast into fire, they do not burn,\nthrown into water, they face no hindrance.\nDrawn from the ashes, whole and revealed,\nsuddenly, they radiate light across the earth.*\n\nAgain, the Teacher wrote:\n*\"Within the furnace and stove, one stands best,\ndo not let dust settle on the walls.\nSwiftly stir the buried flames of the Dao—\nlet warmth spread across heaven and earth like spring.*\n\nThe Teacher sat in a quiet chamber,\nwhen a monk named Cōngdū came to inquire,\nasking: *\"If a woman approaches you face-to-face,\ndo you see her as a woman or as a man?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"This is an ancient case for public discussion—\nyou must ponder and awaken to it yourself.\nIf I were to explain, it would hinder your practice.\"*\n\nThe monk repeatedly begged for an explanation,\nso the Teacher scolded him: *\"Seeing her as a woman is clinging to forms;\nseeing her as a man is blindness to sight.\nTrue nature is inherently undivided—\nattachment to forms creates distinctions.\nTurn away from the form and observe the mind—\nall things will then be thoroughly understood.\"*\n\nThe Teacher again scolded: *\"Learn to go like falling flowers and flowing water.\"*\n\nThe monk remained silent.\n\nThe Teacher said: *\"Seeing as not seeing—\nyou know of men and women;\nthe heart without a heart—\nthere are still merits and faults.\nThe Great Dao knows no division of men and women—\nwhy must you distinguish them?\nThe scriptures say: ‘Observe all as one’,\nyet still, you cling to forms.\nVigorously pass beyond them—\nresponding to affairs like the wind’s myriad sounds,\nperceiving things like the moon’s reflection on a thousand rivers—\nsuch a one is a true sage.\"*\n\nThe monk bowed and departed.\n\nThe Teacher, still in the quiet chamber,\nwas visited by a magistrate named Hé,\nwho asked: *\"Teacher, how do you practice sitting still?\nWhat is your method?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"I merely cultivate simplicity.\"*\n\nThe magistrate said: *\"To have no skill in a hundred matters is to be simple—\nhow then do you attain the Dao of immortality?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"My simplicity is the simplicity of the ancients—\nit is sincere resolve and adherence to one’s proper place,\nwithout contrivance, naturally so.\nThe *Thunder Classic* says:\n‘Use sincerity as if it were stupidity,\nuse silence as if it were dullness,\nuse gentleness as if it were clumsiness—\nthis is it.’\nIf one returns to simplicity, roots in origin, and reclaims their true nature,\nknows to preserve white while guarding black,\ncan generate wisdom,\ntranscend birth and death,\nthey may become an immortal or a Buddha.\nHow could this be compared to the simplicity of having no skill in a hundred matters?\"*\n\nThe magistrate again asked: *\"If the heart is still, it surpasses even a quiet chamber;\nforgetting phenomena is not the same as forgetting the heart—\nthen, what use is stillness?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"The autumn night sky, clear and blue,\nthe moon shines brighter when the clouds are absent.\nMoreover, a quiet chamber keeps external demons out,\na still heart prevents internal demons from arising.\nWhen both inner and outer are tranquil,\nthe body and mind are luminous—\nthis is the Daoist’s true livelihood.\nThe *Laozi* says: ‘Do not see what is desirable, so the heart does not become disturbed.’\nThe *Scriptures of the Immortal and True* say: ‘When external phenomena do not intrude, the inner spirit naturally settles.’\nThis is what I mean.\"*\n\nThe magistrate again asked: *\"The Dao scriptures say: ‘Those who do not lose their place endure long.’\nWhat is this principle?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"This principle applies in three ways—\nto ministers, commoners, and cultivators—\neach has their own place where they find fulfillment.\nIf one does not lose their place,\nthey attain enduring longevity.\n\nFor ministers,\nit is loyalty to the ruler and benefit to the nation,\nconcern for the army and love for the people,\njustice without bias,\nbalancing strength and flexibility—\nnot losing their place means they attain lasting honor and wealth.\n\nFor commoners,\nit is fear of the law,\nunderstanding human relationships,\nindustry and frugality—\nnot losing their place means they attain lasting prosperity in their household.\n\nFor cultivators,\nit is avoiding defilement by worldly dust,\nremaining untouched by secular affairs,\na single heart in tranquility,\nthe Three Treasures blended into one—\nnot losing their place means they attain enduring life and vitality.\n\nMoreover, within each person’s body,\nthere are the Golden Hall and Jade Chamber,\nthe Soul Stand and Vermilion Palace,\nthe Hidden Door and Life Gate,\nthe Mystic Pass and Elixir Barrier.\nIf one does not cultivate themselves,\nthese gradually decay,\nand the master has nowhere to dwell—\nthis is losing one’s place.\"*\n\nThe magistrate again asked: *\"The scriptures say: ‘Those who do not perish after death are long-lived.’\nWhat does this mean?\"*\n\nThe Teacher replied: *\"For cultivators at the moment of departure,\nwhen their vital *qi* is exhausted but the Dao *qi* remains,\nwhen their body dies but their true nature does not perish—\nthey stand firm and unshaken,\nstill and clear as if congealed,\nphenomena cannot lure them,\ncreation cannot bind them,\nthey do not turn or return,\nfree and at ease,\nenduring through all ages—\nthis is the boundless longevity.\"*",

luminous, never concealed.\n**Sitting:**\nStable and unmoving, naturally pure and free,\nPreserving the time to cultivate the inner *Yán* [颜].\n\nNot like dead ashes or withered wood,\nA full moon

emerge from *suōpó* [娑婆].*\n*Do not extinguish the inner flame,*\n*Gradually enter the gate of endless life.*\n\n*The essence is like oil,*\n*The light like spirit,*\n*The *qi* like a lamp’s flame,*\n*The body like its burner.*\n*When oil is full and flame brightens,*\n*The heart stands pure and clear—*\n*Then you’ll see the truth, the lamp’s true owner.*\n*If one is lost, the other falters,*\n*In endless darkness you’ll waste your years.*\n*Coming to this treasure mountain empty-handed,*\n*You’ve lost the coins once spent to buy your life.*\n\n*Awake, listen to me:*\n*When *héhé* [和合] is one, no lack remains.*\n*Refine the *jīndān* [金丹] with a thousand days’ labor,*\n*And death’s cycles will all be pierced.*\n*Cast off the mortal frame,*\n*Exchange for the *xiān gǔ* [仙骨],*\n*The golden-maned lion emerges from its cave.*\n*One radiance shines through the boundless void,*\n*Not consorting with foxes in their schemes.*\n*The *Fǎwáng* [法王]’s seed is no hard task,*\n*But foxes remain worlds apart.*\n*Respect and trust the worthy masters,*\n*Test their teachings now—*\n*In time, you’ll surely join the ranks of immortals.*\n\n**The Song of Self-Lament:**\n\n*Since leaving the world’s dust,*\n*My heart has ever been as one.*\n*I vowed to awaken in the *Xuánmén* [玄门],*\n*To rescue the drowned in the ocean of desire.*\n*At first, it was hard to begin,*\n*Yet I wandered reckless, in and out.*\n*Just to have a free body is called the Dao—*\n*How could I know that such folly invites rebirth’s woe?*\n*Suddenly still, then insight breaks,*\n*The monastery’s gruel now tastes like nectar.*\n*Though I’ve left the world, my heart remains—*\n*If the heart does not leave, all is the same.*\n*With resolve firm and thoughts sharp,*\n*I sought teachers and paths without rest.*\n*On a mid-autumn night, deep and still,*\n*The Master warned me with tender words:*\n*Thank the Master for his guidance,*\n*Now act with lightness and truth.*\n*Though I’ve drifted through the years,*\n*Still I’ve not found the art of endless life.*\n*Crossing mountains and rivers,*\n*Always anxious, always longing—*\n*Till I reached *Xiāoshān* [萧山] by chance,*\n*Where the White Cloud Master recognized me.*\n*His words struck like thunder,*\n*Yet in my darkness, I found their power.*\n*All past deeds were overturned,*\n*No longer did I seek elsewhere.*\n*Walking, sitting—no matter,*\n*Moving or resting, free from care.*\n*Twenty years as a poor man,*\n*Now I hold the treasure within my body.*\n*The paper screen is shattered,*\n*In boundless ease, I follow *yuán* [缘] as it flows.*\n*Others cling to countless bonds,*\n*Eating when hungry, sleeping when weary.*\n*Reflecting now on past words,*\n*I sought to use the *miàodiǎn* [妙典] as my boat.*\n*Yet how many drowned souls*\n*Chase waves in sorrow—*\n*No turning back, no guiding hand,*\n*Shallow fate, no *yīnyuán* [因缘] to pierce the depths.*\n*This boat passed—no more shall come,*\n*Another day, the winds and tides will part.*\n*Wasted paper, wasted tongue,*\n*No man will dare to act with resolve.*\n*Only to beg for idle words,*\n*While eyes bleed in vain thought.*\n*What filth, what filth—*\n*Better return and seal the lips.*\n*When fate and chance align,*\n*From emptiness, I’ll lift the *yúnshǒu* [云手].*\n*Cease, cease, cease—*\n*Draw a line to all good and ill.*\n*Better guard this life’s pearl,*\n*Let its light deter even *shén guǐ* [神鬼].*\n*Silence now, silence—*\n*Lest idle chatter waste your breath.*\n*Few in this world know true harmony,*\n*So I’ll keep my folly in the lonely cliffs.*\n\n*After years of wandering,*\n*Now I’ve cast off the fishing boat.*\n*Let the great waves rise as they will,*\n*In the depths of reeds, I’ll hide my head.*\n\n**The Song of Lethargy:**\n\n*All worldly affairs, past and present,*\n*I’ve seen through—*\n*Yet still I teach the heart to be lazy.*\n*Let others chase fame and fortune,*\n*I’ll not lift my gaze to see.*\n*You rush, I sit—*\n*As they come and go, like turning a millstone.*\n*Who will let the busy rest?*\n*In stillness lies the true labor.*\n*Not lazy, but I love simplicity,*\n*Though men mock me for my plainness.*\n*Just for this plainness I find peace,*\n*And pierce the *xiàngmén* [项门] to open the true eye.*\n*Laziness hides labor,*\n*Labor hides laziness—*\n*Though both dwell in this world, they’re not the same.*\n*Each day the *héchē* [河车] moves,*\n*Three gates struck—*qi* swirls thick.*\n*The true path walks, the crooked stops,*\n*Where others delight, I find no joy.*\n*If you’ll walk where I now tread,*\n*You’ll align with the *tiānlǐ* [天理].*\n*No need to cultivate without,*\n*Only seek within—*\n*Like the pearl hidden in the oyster’s shell.*\n*When the shell cracks, dust scatters,*\n*Its light shines clear, unobstructed.*\n*Stillness in motion, motion in stillness,*\n*Suddenly—wide open, the white jade cave.*\n*Clouds of illusion drift away,*\n*The moon stands clear in the sky—*\n*Seizing the void, turning it inside out.*\n*Moving or resting—both are ease,*\n*Yet in motion and stillness, joy is found.*",
