  "full_translation": "**Title:**\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing with Collective Commentaries*\n(Original title: *Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing with Commentaries by Yi Yin and Six Others*)\nApproximately compiled in the Tang Dynasty. One scroll.\nSource of the base text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Canon of Orthodox Daoism), *Dongzhen* (Verdant Perfection) section, *Yujue* (Jade Precepts) category.\nOther editions include the *Siku Quanshu* (Complete Library of the Four Treasuries) and *Han-Wei Congshu* (Han-Wei Miscellany).\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing**\nComposed by Shu Chancellor Zhuge Liang\n\nWhat is called *ming* (命) is *xing* (性).\nSince *xing* can communicate with *ming*, the Sage reveres it—\nwith Heaven’s decree, the common man is made foolish,\nwhile the Sage is made wise.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When the Heavenly mechanism is taut, there is no death;\nwhen the Earthly mechanism relaxes, there is no birth.\"*\n\nObserving the *Yinshu*,\none sees that creation lies in the hands of mortals,\nwhile life and death lie in the hands of mortals.\n\nThus the Sage conceals it in the heart,\nusing it to mold Heaven and Earth,\nto gather and disperse the world without leaving a trace—\nthis is the Heavenly mechanism.\n\nHence, the Yellow Emperor attained it and ascended to the Cloudy Sky,\nTang and Wu attained it and ruled the world,\nand the Five Hegemons attained it and unified the feudal lords.\n\nThough it is easy for a subject to wield it,\nit is difficult for a ruler to employ it lightly.\nTai Gong at ninety was not unmet—\nhe simply discerned his master’s worth.\n\nIf a wise man were to grasp and apply it,\nsetting stone as sovereign and carving wood as king,\nhe could still enjoy the world.\n\nYet when a subject exhausts his loyalty\nand the ruler recoils in fear—\nis this not difficult indeed?\n\nAlas! Without a virtuous ruler,\nthe righteous man dies rather than serve,\npreferring to scatter his resolve among the rocks\nand nurture his life in seclusion,\nawaiting rebirth in the lofty stages of existence.\n\nThe world deems Confucius as unmet,\nand Qin Yi as fortunate in his time—\nyet how could one who seeks to establish the cosmos\nstoop to chase after petty gains?\n\nThis is what the *Yinshu* condemns.\n\nAlas! Later sages who discern and apply it—\nFan Li was heavy and enduring,\nwhile Wen Zhong was light and perished.\nWas this not a betrayal of Heaven’s mechanism?\n\nHe who betrays Heaven’s mechanism\nshall sink for three kalpas—\nthis is inevitable.\n\nThus the Sage concealed it in sacred mountains,\ntransmitted it to kindred spirits,\nand hid it in golden repositories,\nfearing that the petty would steal and misuse it.\n\n---\n\n**Collective Commentaries on the Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing**\nCommentaries by Yi Yin, Tai Gong, Fan Li, Guiguzi, Zhuge Liang, Zhang Liang, and Li Qun.\n\n*\"To observe the Dao of Heaven,\nto grasp Heaven’s actions—\nthis is exhaustive.\"*\n\n**Introduction:**\nThe *Yinshu* first speaks of Heaven’s Five Thieves—\nthose who perceive them prosper.\n\nTai Gong says:\nThe first thief is *ming* (命),\nthe next thief is *wu* (物),\nthe next thief is *shi* (时),\nthe next thief is *gong* (功),\nthe last thief is *shen* (神).\n\nTo steal *ming* with a single act,\nthe world uses it for *wei* (味).\nTo steal *wu* with urgency,\nthe world uses it for *li* (利).\nTo steal *shi* with trust,\nthe world uses it for *fan* (反).\nTo steal *gong* with favor,\nthe world uses it for *yuan* (怨).\nTo steal *shen* with verification,\nthe world uses it for *xiao* (小) and *da* (大).\n\nGuiguzi says:\nOf Heaven’s Five Thieves,\nnone is greater than stealing *shen*—\nfor the small can take the great,\nand Heaven and Earth cannot conceal it,\nyet it sinks into the hands of mortals.\n\nLi Qun says:\nThe Yellow Emperor stole the mechanism of *ming*,\nand ascended in broad daylight.\nThe Yin and Zhou dynasties stole the verification of *shen*,\nand used the small to extinguish the great.\nGuan Zhong stole the trust of *shi*,\nand united the feudal lords nine times.\nFan Li stole the urgency of *wu*,\nand became hegemon of the southern Yue.\nZhang Liang stole the favor of *gong*,\nand defeated the mighty Chu.\n\nThe Five Thieves reside in the heart,\nyet their effects manifest in Heaven.\nThe cosmos lies in the hands of mortals,\nand all transformations arise from the body.\n\nTai Gong says:\nThe Sage calls them Five Thieves,\nwhile the world calls them Five Virtues.\nMan eats the Five Flavors and lives,\neats the Five Flavors and dies—\nyet no one abandons them in resentment.\nThe heart’s inclinations are the same.\n\nGuiguzi says:\nStealing *ming* can lead to immortality—\nthe Yellow Emperor was inspired by a maiden’s *jing* and *qi*,\nand the same applies to all things.\nEven winter grass, if covered, does not die,\nbut exposed, it withers—\nplants and trees, with their rooted nature,\nare still thus;\nhow much more so for humans,\nthe most refined of all things,\nwhose mechanisms depend on the maiden’s timely essence.\n\nGuangchengzi says:\nTo accumulate fire and burn the Five Poisons—\nthe Five Poisons are the Five Flavors.\nWhen the Five Flavors are exhausted,\nimmortality is attained.\n\nLi Qun says:\nMan lives by the Five Flavors,\ndies by the Five Flavors—\neach flavor governs its own domain:\nharmonizing them brings life,\ndefying them brings destruction.\nProlonged indulgence accumulates *qi* and fumes,\nrotting the five viscera,\nuntil annihilation is near.\nThus, those who do not complete their natural span\nare weighed down by their own excess.\n\nHence, the Supreme Dao is insipid,\nand embryonic breathing is flavorless.\n\nThere are a hundred methods of Daoist cultivation,\nyet their essence lies in *bao yi shou zhong* (embracing unity, guarding the center).\nThere are a hundred methods of maidenly arts,\nyet their essence lies in *huan jing cai qi* (returning essence and refining *qi*).\nThere are a hundred methods of Golden Elixir alchemy,\nyet their essence lies in *shen shui hua chi* (divine water, flowered pool).\nThere are a hundred methods of statecraft,\nyet their essence lies in *qing jing zi hua* (clarity, purity, self-transformation).\nThere are a hundred methods of warfare,\nyet their essence lies in *qi zheng quan mou* (strategic odd-even, power and deception).\n\nThese five matters—\nwhen rolled up, concealed in the heart, hidden in the spirit;\nwhen applied, they permeate Heaven and bind Earth.\n\nThe cosmos can be grasped in an instant,\nlife and death can be wielded in the body.\nThe Yellow Emperor attained it,\nfirst securing the Three Palaces,\nthen governing the myriad lands,\nand when the tripod was complete,\nhe rode the dragon and ascended to Heaven.\n\nHeaven’s nature is *ren* (人).\nMan’s heart is the mechanism.\nTo establish Heaven’s Dao is to define humanity.\n\nZhuge Liang says:\nTo establish Heaven and define humanity—\nthis lies in the Five Thieves.\n\nWhen Heaven’s killing mechanism is unleashed,\ndragons and serpents rise from the land.\nWhen man’s killing mechanism is unleashed,\nHeaven and Earth are overturned.\n\nFan Li says:\nIn ancient times, Yi Yin served the Yin,\nand when he unleashed Heaven’s killing mechanism,\nthe command of Xia was exhausted,\nand the deed was fulfilled.\nThus there were grievances from the eastern conquest of the western barbarians,\nand the southern conquest of the northern nomads.\n\nTai Gong says:\nIf one does not till the fields,\nthree years of great drought follow.\nIf one does not inspect the people,\nten years of land collapse follow.\nWhen one slays over ten thousand,\ngreat winds and storms arise.\n\nZhuge Liang says:\nWhen Chu unleashed its killing mechanism against the Han army of tens of thousands,\ngreat winds obscured the skies, darkening the day as though Heaven and Earth were overturned.\nThis is when Heaven’s and humanity’s killing mechanisms align—\nthe foundation for all transformations is set.\n\nLiang says:\nFrom this single act of trust arises all trust—\nthus it becomes the foundation for all transformations.\n\nQian says:\nIn times of great chaos and disorder,\nwars, floods, droughts, and locust plagues—\nthese are Heaven’s killing mechanisms.\n\nYu Shun refined the clay to make vessels,\nXia Yu rescued the drowned,\nYin imprisoned the Xia sovereign,\nZhou held the Zhou king captive in Youli,\nHan Zu became a market overseer,\nWei Wu begged for alms—\nall were not born to royal station,\nyet they seized Heaven’s killing mechanisms.\n\nRising from obscurity to rule,\nvirtuous men in exile while knaves hold power,\ntyrants wielding authority,\nthe people yearning for rebellion—\nthese are humanity’s killing mechanisms.\n\nTang of Shang exiled Jie,\nWu of Zhou overthrew Zhou,\nXiang Yu beheaded the infant heir of Chu,\nWei deposed Liu Xie—\nthese were seizing humanity’s killing mechanisms.\n\nWhen the noble falls to ignominy,\nand the lowly ascends to nobility,\nit is as though Heaven and Earth were overturned—\nHeaven’s and humanity’s mechanisms align,\nand the logic of success and failure is manifest.\n\nAmid myriad transformations and changes,\nthe Sage acts in accordance to establish the foundation of affairs.\n\nNature has its clever and clumsy—\nthese can be concealed or revealed.\n\nLiang says:\nWhen the Sage perceives cleverness or clumsiness,\nwhere one’s advantage lies in another’s disadvantage,\nhis strategy is formed in mind;\nwhere one’s advantage aligns with another’s,\nthen the Dao of the Sage, the wise, and the heroic unfolds.\nHow much more so in the art of war?\n\nQian says:\nWhen inner desires do not manifest, it is called *opening* (启);\nwhen external evils do not penetrate, it is called *closing* (闭).\nExternal closing and inner opening—\nthis is the mechanism.\n\nHard to discern as darkness,\nimmovable as mountains—\nthe clever and clumsy of nature\nmake one unable to detect gaps,\nyet allow glimpses.\n\nThe nine orifices’ evils\nlie in the three critical points,\nwhich can be moved or stilled.\n\nTai Gong says:\nThe three critical points are the ears, eyes, and mouth.\nEars can be pierced to dull hearing,\neyes can be blinded to disrupt vision,\nthe mouth can be sharpened to stammer.\nWhen raising an army and stirring the masses,\nno ten thousand men can fathom its subtlety.\nAmong these three, some can be moved, some can be stilled.\n\nQian says:\n\nThe two leaves covering the eyes—\nthe great Tai Shan cannot be seen;\nthe two beans plugging the ears—\nthe thunder cannot be heard;\na single berry brushing the tongue—\none cannot speak with ease.\nWhen the nine orifices are all filled with evils,\nthey cannot perceive the subtleties of change.\n\nYet among these three, there are *spirit* (神), *mind* (心), and *will* (志).\nWhen the mechanism moves but has not yet taken form,\n*spirit* follows it;\nwhen the mechanism’s signs are about to manifest,\n*mind* plans for it;\nwhen the mechanism is triggered and action begins,\n*will* decides upon it.\n\nWhen the mechanism moves,\nits force aligns with *yang* (陽),\nand the Five Great Mountains cannot suppress its corner,\nnor the Four Great Seas contain its span.\nWhen the mechanism stirs,\nits virtue harmonizes with *yin* (陰),\nand wise men cannot manipulate its glory,\nnor deep scholars discern its schemes.\nHeaven and Earth cannot alter its timing—\nhow much less can men?\n\nFire arises from wood,\nand disaster strikes when it erupts.\nDeceit arises from the state,\nand collapse follows when it moves.\nTo know this and refine one’s conduct—\nthis is the way of the *sage* (聖人).\nQian says:\nFire arises from wood,\nyet when it first appears, it is formless.\nDeceit arises from the state,\nyet when it first appears, it is without sign.\nOnly the *Supreme Sage* (至聖) can cultivate the self and refine actions,\npreventing the fire of deceit from igniting.\nThus, a state may have soldiers without war,\nand disasters without calamity.\n\nJi Zi fled yet was bound in a leather apron,\nShang Rong was imprisoned while Shěn Shù wept.\nHeaven’s birth and death—\nthe Dao’s natural order.\nLiang says:\nThe mechanism emerges from the mind,\nlike Heaven’s giving life or taking it,\nso that those born say they gained their birth,\nand the dead say they met their fate.\n\nHeaven and Earth are thieves of all things;\nall things are thieves of man;\nman is a thief of all things.\nWhen these three thieves are in harmony,\nthe Three Talents are at peace.\n\nGhost Valley Master says:\nThe three thieves are mutual ignorance—\nthis is called *spirit*.\nTo understand these three,\nhow much more can one abandon wealth and treasure,\neven if it could empty rivers and seas,\nor shift mountains to cover the earth?\nIf one acts without *fate* (命),\nthen success follows.\n\nQian says:\nHeaven and Earth, along with all things, are born of *qi* (精氣),\nand they decline and age through theft.\nAll things, as man’s tools and adornments,\nsteal from him through arrogance and excess.\nMan, as the sovereign of all things,\nsteals from them through ruin and destruction—\nall proceed naturally,\nand the three thieves each fulfill their role,\nwhile the Three Talents sequentially uphold their duty.\n\nThus it is said:\nTo eat in season, the hundred bones are in order.\nTo move the mechanism, all transformations are at peace.\nGhost Valley Master says:\nI do not wish for future generations of rulers\nto hoard treasures and amass gold and silk,\nfor if one can abandon them,\neven emptying rivers and seas would not be enough to challenge it.\nTo eat is to nourish the hundred bones,\nyet losing one’s season brings a hundred ailments.\nTo move is to harmonize all things,\nyet losing the mechanism harms all things.\nThus the most opportune moment\nadmits no pause—\nto act before it is to overreach,\nto act after is to miss it entirely.\nHence, the virtuous guard the moment,\nwhile the unworthy cling to fate.\n\nMen know their *spirit* yet remain *spirit*,\nbut they do not know how *spirit* comes to be.\nQian says:\nAll men possess the *sage’s* virtue,\nyet they do not value the *sage’s* folly.\nHaving seen their virtue,\nthey must also observe their folly.\nHaving seen their folly,\nthey must again see their virtue—\nhence the *Book of Documents* says:\nTo rely solely on cleverness and insight,\naffairs will not succeed.\nTo rely solely on obscurity and dullness,\naffairs will all falter.\nOne moment of clarity, one moment of obscurity—\nthe multitude depends upon them.\n\nYi Yin kept taverns,\nTai Gong butchered cattle,\nGuan Zhong made leather,\nBai Li Xi sold porridge,\nyet when the time of decline and chaos came,\nmen said they were not *spirit*-guided—\nuntil they met Tang the Victorious,\nencountered Wen Wang,\nserved Qi Huan,\nor met Qin Mu,\nwhen the Dao flowed through their lives,\nand their achievements reached the cosmos,\nand men called them *Supreme Spirit*.\n\nThe sun and moon have their numbers,\nthe great and small have their limits.\nFrom these, *sage*ly achievements arise,\nand *spirit* and clarity emerge.\n\nGhost Valley Master says:\nFuture generations pondering this will realize\nthat Heaven and Earth are not to be prized—\nhow much less so men?\n\nQian says:\nA year contains three hundred sixty-five days,\nand days have their numbers,\nmonths cycle eleven or twelve times,\nwith accumulated *intercalary months* (闰) defining great and small—\nthe remaining fractions are set,\nall receiving *qi* (精氣) naturally,\nnot created by *sage*ly achievements or *spirit*.\n*Sage*ly achievements and *spirit* also arise from *qi*,\nnot from the sun and moon.\n\nThus, success is not prized from Heaven and Earth,\nnor defeat blamed upon *yin* and *yang*.\nIts theft of the mechanism—\nnone under Heaven can know it.\n\nThe *gentleman* (君子) who gains it secures his life;\nthe *petty man* (小人) who gains it risks his fate.\nZhuge Liang says:\nWas the Duke of Zhou not more virtuous than Sun, Wu, Han, and Bai?\nYet this is why the *gentleman* and *petty man* differ.\n\nThe Four Sons’ courage reached the point of self-sacrifice,\nyet they were slain because they did not grasp their master’s intent.\n\nQian says:\nWhen the master’s intent is slighted,\nnone under Heaven can perceive the mechanism of humiliation,\nnor can they know the source of it.\nWhen the *tyrant-king* (霸王) moves to expand his realm,\nnone can perceive the mechanism of founding a state,\nnor can they know its source.\n\nThe *gentleman* who gains the mechanism\nresponds to Heaven and aligns with men,\nthus securing his life.\nThe *petty man* who gains the mechanism\ndisturbs the military and indulges in violence,\nthus risking his fate.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\nThe *gentleman* acts upon seeing the mechanism,\nrequiring no delay until day’s end.\nIt also says:\nDoes one know the mechanism’s *spirit*?\n\nThe mechanism is easy to see yet hard to know—\nto see the near and know the far.\nThe blind excel in hearing,\nthe deaf excel in sight.\nTo sever one source of advantage,\none can multiply the army tenfold;\nto reverse day and night three times,\none can multiply the army ten thousandfold.\n\nYin says:\nTo ponder with precision,\nis to exhaust its subtleties.\nLiang says:\nFuture generations pondering this—\nthe sharpness of ears and eyes,\nto sever one source of advantage.\n\nQian says:\nThe ears and eyes of men\nare all divided by the mind,\nand culminate in *spirit*.\nWhen the mind is divided,\nthe mechanism is not precise;\nwhen *spirit* is exhausted,\nthe mechanism is not subtle—\nthus, Shi Kuang blinded his eyes yet sharpened his ears,\nLi Zhu coated his ears yet brightened his sight,\nyet relying on one source of advantage alone\nwould reverse the army’s strength in the mind.\nTo undertake actions and trigger the mechanism,\nall will be fully achieved.\n\nThe retreat of thought through three reversals,\nto traverse the day and endure the night—\nto think, then act.\n\nWhen undertaking actions and triggering the mechanism,\nall will be accomplished with absolute certainty.\n\n**Taigong** says:\nWhen the eyes move, the heart responds.\nIf what is seen is favorable, act;\nif what is seen is not, halt.\n\nThe heart arises from things, perishes from things—\nthe mechanism lies in the eyes.\n\n**Qian** says:\nNone surpass the heart and eyes\nin being the mechanism of the world.\n\nThe heart can activate the eyes,\nthe eyes can perceive the mechanism.\n\nWhen Qin Shi Huang toured the east at Kuaiji,\nXiang Yu saw its mechanism—\nhis heart arose from things—\nand told Xiang Liang:\n*\"He can be taken and replaced.\"*\n\nWhen the Jin army fully assembled at Huaihe,\nFu Jian saw its mechanism—\nhis heart perished from things—\nand told Fu Rong:\n*\"They are a formidable enemy—\nwhy are they so few?\"*\n\nThus, one knows that the heart’s life and death lie in things,\nwhile the mechanisms of success and failure appear in the eyes.\n\nHeaven, though without favor, gives rise to great favor.\nSwift thunder and fierce winds—\nnone fail to tremble in awe.\n\n**Liang** says:\nHow resplendent!\n\n**Taigong** says:\nCaution and reverence bring fortune.\n\n**Qian** says:\nHeaven’s heart has no favor,\nyet all things have hearts,\nreturning favor to Heaven.\n\n**Laozi** says:\nHeaven and Earth are not kind,\ntreating all things as straw dogs.\nThe Sage is not kind,\ntreating the people as straw dogs.\n\nThus, they bestow without expecting repayment,\ngive birth without claiming credit.\n\nYet when swift thunder and fierce winds strike—\ntheir might is distant, their terror near—\nall things tremble in fear,\nHeaven holds no threat, yet all things fear it,\nand all things, fearing, return threat to Heaven.\n\nThe Sage, in bestowing rewards,\nhas no favor toward those who merit them.\nIn punishing crimes,\nhas no threat toward the guilty.\n\nThus, rewards and punishments are established by the ruler,\nwhile awe and favor operate below.\n\nSupreme joy leaves excess,\nsupreme stillness leaves purity.\n\n**Liang** says:\nThe mechanism lies here.\n\n**Qian** says:\nJoy leads to extravagance,\nstillness to integrity.\nExcess dulls the spirit,\npurity clears the spirit.\n\nThe spirit is the source of wisdom—\nwhen clear, wisdom is bright.\nWisdom is the repository of the heart—\nwhen balanced, the heart is even.\n\nNo one mirrors themselves in flowing water,\nbut in still water—\nfor its clarity and evenness.\n\nWhen the spirit is clear and intent is balanced,\none can discern the true nature of things.\n\nThe Sage does not indulge in supreme joy,\nnor rest in supreme stillness,\nbut dwells between pure spirit and measured delight—\nthis is called *guarding the Middle*.\n\nThus, advantages cannot seduce,\nsounds and colors cannot disrupt,\npersuasive speakers cannot deceive,\nwise men cannot sway,\nbrave men cannot intimidate.\n\nThey foresee calamity beyond the heavy gates,\nanticipate disaster in the deepest darkness—\nHeaven itself cannot defy them,\nlet alone the deceptive ways of war.\n\nHeaven’s utmost partiality—\n**Yin** says:\n*Refining the subtlest extremes.*\n\nIts use is utterly impartial.\n**Liang** says:\n*Its mechanism is flawless—\neven without commanding the world, it acts.*\n\nThe world cannot know it,\nthe world cannot defy it.\n\n**Qian** says:\nHeaven’s Dao curves to complete all things without omission.\nThe *chun* mushroom, the *jun* fungus, the *peng* bird, the *yuan* wildfowl—\nministers of varying refinement and stature,\neach attaining its place—\nthis is utmost partiality.\n\nClouds march, rain descends,\nthunder crashes, lightning strikes,\nfrost and rainbows—\nlife and death balanced—\nthis is utmost impartiality.\n\nThe Sage follows Heaven, models Earth,\nnourishes the people,\ndiscerns their labor and suffering—\nthis is utmost partiality.\n\nIssues just decrees,\napplies laws with precision—\nthis is utmost impartiality.\n\n**Sun Wu** says:\nView your soldiers as beloved children—\nyou can die with them.\nView your soldiers as infants—\nyou can lead them into deep ravines.\n\nLove without command is like a spoiled child—\nthus, govern them with ritual,\nalign them with force.\n\nThe principle of *qi* determines prey.\n**Taigong** says:\n*Does it not lie in greatness and smallness?*\n\n**Yin** says:\n*Qi is Heaven’s mechanism.*\n\n**Qian** says:\nThe tortoise devours the python,\nthe falcon strikes the crane.\nThe *huangyao* (yellow-bellied beast) preys on tigers,\nthe flying squirrel severs the monkey,\nthe toad and leech consume fish,\nthe wolf and *yi* (wild dog) gnaw at cranes.\n\nGold melts in sweetness,\nthe *heche* (river turtle) absorbs it to endlessly transform into jade,\nrealgar alters iron,\nthere are woods that do not burn,\nstones that float—\nwhen birds, beasts, trees, and stones attain their *qi*,\neven the small can overcome the great—\nhow much more so when heroes attain their *qi*,\nand cannot purify the world or master the cosmos?\n\nLife is the root of death;\ndeath is the root of life.\nFavor arises from harm,\nharm arises from favor.\n\n**Taigong** says:\nThose who diminish themselves are loved by things,\nthose who enrich themselves are slighted by things.\n\n**Qian** says:\nTo plot for life,\none must first die, then live.\nTo accustom oneself to death,\none must first live, then die.\n\n**Huguanzi** says:\nNot dying, not living,\nnot severing, not completing.\n\n**Sun Wu** says:\nCast them into death’s ground and they will live,\ndrive them to ruin’s edge and they will survive.\n\n**Wu Qi** says:\nOn the battlefield, where corpses stand,\nthose who must die will live,\nthose who hope to live will die.\n\nFavor is the source of harm,\nharm is the source of favor.\nWu bestowed favor on Yue and gave rise to harm,\nZhou established harm against Shang and gave rise to favor.\n\nLife and death, favor and harm—\nopposing yet intertwined.\n\nThe foolish take Heaven and Earth’s patterns as sagely,\nI take the patterns of things as wise.\n\n**Taigong** says:\nObserve the timing of birds and beasts,\nscrutinize the changes of all things.\n\n**Qian** says:\nWhen the *jing* star appears,\nwhen the yellow dragon descends,\nwhen the soaring phoenix arrives,\nwhen the *li* spring gushes forth,\nwhen fine grains grow,\nwhen the river does not overflow,\nwhen the sea does not surge,\nwhen the sun and moon are eclipsed,\nwhen the five stars stray,\nwhen the four seasons disorder,\nwhen day darkens and night shines,\nwhen mountains collapse and rivers dry,\nwhen winter thunder or summer frost strikes—\nthe foolish take these as Heaven and Earth’s patterns,\nas the mechanisms of order and chaos.\n\nWith tranquil thought, light shines to the four quarters,\nvirtue is perfected, and the nine clans are cherished.\n\nThe six ministries and three affairs\ndo not encroach upon their ranks,\nall grains are cultivated,\nthe myriad people prosper—\n\nWhile the foolish ruler and corrupt ministers\nissue conflicting laws,\nimpose heavy taxes and harsh governance,\ndeceive above and below,\nwhile noble relatives and favored ministers\nindulge in arrogance, excess, and licentiousness,\ndrunk on wine, obsessed with music,\nbuilding towering halls and ornate walls—\nthe people flee and resent the ruler.\n\n「At this moment, the patterns of things are the mechanisms of order and chaos.\nThe common folk regard it as a time of doubt and foolishness,\nbut I do not regard it as such.\nThe common folk hope for a sage, but I do not wait for one.\n\nThe *Yǔ* says:\n*\"The hearts of the wise and virtuous are profound and subtle, beyond measure.\nThe traces of *Yóuchuāng*’s actions may be glimpsed by some.\nBut when it comes to responding to change without fixed methods,\nto the boundless intelligence that shifts with every circumstance—\nhow could the common folk foresee it?\nTo judge the heart by its traces is the folly of the ignorant.\"*\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"To sink into water or plunge into fire is to court one’s own destruction.\nTo govern men without wisdom leads to their ruin,\nto lead armies without strategy results in the loss of soldiers.\nWithout death, there is no escape from death;\nwithout life, there is no escape from life—\nthus, one who understands death and life\nbrings peace to the state.*\n\nThe Dao of Nature is tranquil,\nand so Heaven and Earth, along with the myriad things, flourish.\nThe *Yǐn* says:\n*\"When tranquility reaches its utmost, one does not know how things come to be.*\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual,\nand so *Yīnyáng* prevails in its transformations.\"\n\nThe *Liáng* says:\n*\"The Dao of Heaven and Earth is subtle yet relentless in its unfolding triumph.\nWhen *Yīnyáng* push against each other, their changes proceed in perfect harmony.\"*\n\nThe *Liáng* says:\n*\"When *Yīnyáng* clash and interact, their transformations appear even in the flicker of an eye.\nThus, the Sage knows that the Dao of Nature cannot be defied,\nand acts accordingly to regulate it.\"*\n\nThe *Liáng* says:\n*\"The great person sees it as the natural way,\nthe wise and virtuous see it as regulation,\nthe foolish see it as mere transformation.\"*\n\nThe *Yǐn* says:\n*\"To know the Dao of Nature is to realize that all things cannot defy it.\nTherefore, one acts in accordance with it for advantage.\"*\n\nThe Dao of utmost purity\ncannot be fully captured by laws and calendars.\nThe *Liáng* says:\n*\"Observing the timing of birds and beasts,\nand noting the changes of all things—\nwhen birds and beasts reach their purest state,\nlaws and calendars cannot fully grasp them.\nYet, from this, one discerns their hidden patterns.\"*\n\nHere lies a wondrous instrument,\nthe source of all phenomena.\nThe eight *guà* and sixty *jiǎzǐ* cycles\ndecipher but one ten-thousandth of its workings.\nIts principles are divine, its secrets concealed.\n\nThe *Liáng* says:\n*\"The six *yǐng* cycles are the hidden Dao of Heaven,\ncapable of concealment and suppression.\"*\n\nThe techniques of *Yīnyáng*’s mutual triumph\nare made manifest through their symbols.\nThe *Liàng* says:\n*\"This wondrous instrument is the Sage’s wisdom.\nHeaven displays its symbols,\nand the Sage follows them in action.\nBy tracing the *jiǎzǐ* cycles,\ndrawing the eight *guà* patterns,\ninterpreting the *shī* stalks and *guī* shells,\nand consulting laws and calendars—\nthe emotions of ghosts and gods,\nthe principles of *Yīnyáng*,\nare revealed in their symbols,\nand nothing remains concealed.\"*\n\nThe *Liàng* says:\n*\"The symbols of the eight *guà* are applied and put to use;\nthe sixty *jiǎzǐ* cycles are turned and utilized.\nWhen divine principles emerge and spirits move,\nall is illuminated in a single moment.\"*\n\nThe *Liáng* says:\n*\"The origin of all things and their transformations\nis the mind itself.\nTo master the techniques of concealing and revealing *Yīnyáng*,\nand to align with the cycles of sun and moon—\nthese are made clear in the human heart.\"*\n\nThe *Guǎngchéngzǐ* says:\n*\"The *jiǎzǐ* cycles correspond to the number nine of *Yīnyáng*.\nThe patterns of the *guà* reveal the methods of deploying armies.\nTo deploy armies is to use the *Lǜ* [music/ritual],\nto move in accordance with ghosts and gods,\nto follow Heaven’s will and adapt to the times—\nthus, one applies the Dao of ghosts and gods.\"*\n\nThe *Yǐnhújīng* of the Yellow Emperor concludes here.",

      "translated_text": "**Title:**\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing with Collective Commentaries*\n(Original title: *Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing with Commentaries by Yi Yin and Six Others*)\nApproximately compiled in the Tang Dynasty. One scroll.\nSource of the base text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Canon of Orthodox Daoism), *Dongzhen* (Verdant Perfection) section, *Yujue* (Jade Precepts) category.\nOther editions include the *Siku Quanshu* (Complete Library of the Four Treasuries) and *Han-Wei Congshu* (Han-Wei Miscellany).\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing**\nComposed by Shu Chancellor Zhuge Liang\n\nWhat is called *ming* (命) is *xing* (性).\nSince *xing* can communicate with *ming*, the Sage reveres it—\nwith Heaven’s decree, the common man is made foolish,\nwhile the Sage is made wise.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When the Heavenly mechanism is taut, there is no death;\nwhen the Earthly mechanism relaxes, there is no birth.\"*\n\nObserving the *Yinshu*,\none sees that creation lies in the hands of mortals,\nwhile life and death lie in the hands of mortals.\n\nThus the Sage conceals it in the heart,\nusing it to mold Heaven and Earth,\nto gather and disperse the world without leaving a trace—\nthis is the Heavenly mechanism.\n\nHence, the Yellow Emperor attained it and ascended to the Cloudy Sky,\nTang and Wu attained it and ruled the world,\nand the Five Hegemons attained it and unified the feudal lords.\n\nThough it is easy for a subject to wield it,\nit is difficult for a ruler to employ it lightly.\nTai Gong at ninety was not unmet—\nhe simply discerned his master’s worth.\n\nIf a wise man were to grasp and apply it,\nsetting stone as sovereign and carving wood as king,\nhe could still enjoy the world.\n\nYet when a subject exhausts his loyalty\nand the ruler recoils in fear—\nis this not difficult indeed?\n\nAlas! Without a virtuous ruler,\nthe righteous man dies rather than serve,\npreferring to scatter his resolve among the rocks\nand nurture his life in seclusion,\nawaiting rebirth in the lofty stages of existence.\n\nThe world deems Confucius as unmet,\nand Qin Yi as fortunate in his time—\nyet how could one who seeks to establish the cosmos\nstoop to chase after petty gains?\n\nThis is what the *Yinshu* condemns.\n\nAlas! Later sages who discern and apply it—\nFan Li was heavy and enduring,\nwhile Wen Zhong was light and perished.\nWas this not a betrayal of Heaven’s mechanism?\n\nHe who betrays Heaven’s mechanism\nshall sink for three kalpas—\nthis is inevitable.\n\nThus the Sage concealed it in sacred mountains,\ntransmitted it to kindred spirits,\nand hid it in golden repositories,\nfearing that the petty would steal and misuse it.\n\n---\n\n**Collective Commentaries on the Yellow Emperor’s Yinshu Jing**\nCommentaries by Yi Yin, Tai Gong, Fan Li, Guiguzi, Zhuge Liang, Zhang Liang, and Li Qun.\n\n*\"To observe the Dao of Heaven,\nto grasp Heaven’s actions—\nthis is exhaustive.\"*\n\n**Introduction:**\nThe *Yinshu* first speaks of Heaven’s Five Thieves—\nthose who perceive them prosper.\n\nTai Gong says:\nThe first thief is *ming* (命),\nthe next thief is *wu* (物),\nthe next thief is *shi* (时),\nthe next thief is *gong* (功),\nthe last thief is *shen* (神).\n\nTo steal *ming* with a single act,\nthe world uses it for *wei* (味).\nTo steal *wu* with urgency,\nthe world uses it for *li* (利).\nTo steal *shi* with trust,\nthe world uses it for *fan* (反).\nTo steal *gong* with favor,\nthe world uses it for *yuan* (怨).\nTo steal *shen* with verification,\nthe world uses it for *xiao* (小) and *da* (大).\n\nGuiguzi says:\nOf Heaven’s Five Thieves,\nnone is greater than stealing *shen*—\nfor the small can take the great,\nand Heaven and Earth cannot conceal it,\nyet it sinks into the hands of mortals.\n\nLi Qun says:\nThe Yellow Emperor stole the mechanism of *ming*,\nand ascended in broad daylight.\nThe Yin and Zhou dynasties stole the verification of *shen*,\nand used the small to extinguish the great.\nGuan Zhong stole the trust of *shi*,\nand united the feudal lords nine times.\nFan Li stole the urgency of *wu*,\nand became hegemon of the southern Yue.\nZhang Liang stole the favor of *gong*,\nand defeated the mighty Chu.\n\nThe Five Thieves reside in the heart,\nyet their effects manifest in Heaven.\nThe cosmos lies in the hands of mortals,\nand all transformations arise from the body.\n\nTai Gong says:\nThe Sage calls them Five Thieves,\nwhile the world calls them Five Virtues.\nMan eats the Five Flavors and lives,\neats the Five Flavors and dies—\nyet no one abandons them in resentment.\nThe heart’s inclinations are the same.\n\nGuiguzi says:\nStealing *ming* can lead to immortality—\nthe Yellow Emperor was inspired by a maiden’s *jing* and *qi*,\nand the same applies to all things.\nEven winter grass, if covered, does not die,\nbut exposed, it withers—\nplants and trees, with their rooted nature,\nare still thus;\nhow much more so for humans,\nthe most refined of all things,\nwhose mechanisms depend on the maiden’s timely essence.\n\nGuangchengzi says:\nTo accumulate fire and burn the Five Poisons—\nthe Five Poisons are the Five Flavors.\nWhen the Five Flavors are exhausted,\nimmortality is attained.\n\nLi Qun says:\nMan lives by the Five Flavors,\ndies by the Five Flavors—\neach flavor governs its own domain:\nharmonizing them brings life,\ndefying them brings destruction.\nProlonged indulgence accumulates *qi* and fumes,\nrotting the five viscera,\nuntil annihilation is near.\nThus, those who do not complete their natural span\nare weighed down by their own excess.\n\nHence, the Supreme Dao is insipid,\nand embryonic breathing is flavorless.\n\nThere are a hundred methods of Daoist cultivation,\nyet their essence lies in *bao yi shou zhong* (embracing unity, guarding the center).\nThere are a hundred methods of maidenly arts,\nyet their essence lies in *huan jing cai qi* (returning essence and refining *qi*).\nThere are a hundred methods of Golden Elixir alchemy,\nyet their essence lies in *shen shui hua chi* (divine water, flowered pool).\nThere are a hundred methods of statecraft,\nyet their essence lies in *qing jing zi hua* (clarity, purity, self-transformation).\nThere are a hundred methods of warfare,\nyet their essence lies in *qi zheng quan mou* (strategic odd-even, power and deception).\n\nThese five matters—\nwhen rolled up, concealed in the heart, hidden in the spirit;\nwhen applied, they permeate Heaven and bind Earth.\n\nThe cosmos can be grasped in an instant,\nlife and death can be wielded in the body.\nThe Yellow Emperor attained it,\nfirst securing the Three Palaces,\nthen governing the myriad lands,\nand when the tripod was complete,\nhe rode the dragon and ascended to Heaven.\n\nHeaven’s nature is *ren* (人).\nMan’s heart is the mechanism.\nTo establish Heaven’s Dao is to define humanity.\n\nZhuge Liang says:\nTo establish Heaven and define humanity—\nthis lies in the Five Thieves.\n\nWhen Heaven’s killing mechanism is unleashed,\ndragons and serpents rise from the land.\nWhen man’s killing mechanism is unleashed,\nHeaven and Earth are overturned.\n\nFan Li says:\nIn ancient times, Yi Yin served the Yin,\nand when he unleashed Heaven’s killing mechanism,\nthe command of Xia was exhausted,\nand the deed was fulfilled.\nThus there were grievances from the eastern conquest of the western barbarians,\nand the southern conquest of the northern nomads.\n\nTai Gong says:\nIf one does not till the fields,\nthree years of great drought follow.\nIf one does not inspect the people,\nten years of land collapse follow.\nWhen one slays over ten thousand,\ngreat winds and storms arise.",
