The Orthodox Unity transmitted its lineage, elucidating awe-inspiring majesty to reveal the hidden and the bound. Thus, divine scriptures and wondrous canons, though timely in their emergence, must align with the moment. The primordial statutes and true regulations truly serve as warnings against reckless transmission.\n\nWith reverence, I acknowledge the benevolent sagacity of the sovereign above, who has received the Heavenly Mandate, propagated the supreme Dao, and achieved perfection. Recently, a Palace of Precious Registers was established in the capital, and an ordination altar was set near the imperial precincts. Through talismanic remedies and healing elixirs, the well-being of the common people is safeguarded. Those who receive profound blessings number in the thousands daily, while those who turn toward the true wind account for eight or nine out of ten.\n\nI have gathered and sought out immortal scriptures, mending omissions and completing lacunae. From all corners of the realm, nothing has been left uncollected. Now, I have compiled and collated these secret treasures, intending to engrave and transmit them for eternity, that the world may be steeped in primordial purity and the people may cultivate their nature and destiny. This may indeed be called an era of pure and complete *Dao*-*qi*, an age of ten thousand generations of Great Peace.\n\nYour servant, by early fortune, has been graced with this opportunity, humbly dwelling among the feathered ranks. I have traversed the renowned mountains and sacred peaks of the four directions, seeking out masters and their teachings. For over thirty years, I have roughly grasped the essentials, preparing them for practical application. How could I not be stirred to action in such a time?\n\nFormerly, while residing in Nanyang, I once used talismanic waters to relieve the suffering of the afflicted. Within a few years, the number of officials and commoners who benefited was beyond counting. One day, I was unexpectedly honored with an imperial decree...\n\nHaving been summoned to the palace gates, I was further honored with imperial titles and bestowed with gracious favors—how could my meager merits ever repay such celestial benevolence?\n\nIn the seventh month of the previous year, I was commissioned by decree to join the Scriptural Bureau, where I was tasked with collating lost texts and examining the *Qiongwen* Daoist Canon, as well as overseeing the carving of talismanic script. Through this, I was privileged to peruse the catalogues of scriptures. Among the vast array of divine chapters and precious talismans, nothing was lacking—yet I found the methods of healing the world and curing ailments, those arts timely and applicable for the present age, to be notably obscure and incomplete, without any comprehensive and readily usable texts.\n\nUnwilling to hoard what I have learned, and undeterred by my own inadequacies, I have compiled the talismanic methods and secret oral instructions I received into ten scrolls, entitled *The Supreme Essential Secrets for Assisting the Nation and Saving the People*. Having transcribed this work in full, I now humbly present it, hoping it may modestly aid the sagely intent, uncover even a fraction of the Dao’s manifold teachings, and serve future disciples by broadening their knowledge. This is the deepest aspiration of this unworthy servant in the Way.\n\nComposed with reverence on the fifteenth day of the intercalary first month of the sixth year of the Zhenghe era.\n\nBy *Dongyou* Master Yuan Miaozong.\n\n*Scroll One of The Supreme Essential Secrets for Assisting the Nation and Saving the People*\nCompiled by Yuan Miaozong, Master of Mysteries.\n\n*Preface to the Supreme Clarity Northern Culmen Heavenly Heart Orthodox Methods, with the Petition and Protocol for the Bureau of Expelling Malevolence*\n\nI have heard that the Heavenly Heart Methods are the methods of the Northern Culmen and Central Dipper. The Northern Culmen is the central pole of Heaven, where all phenomena converge. The Northern Dipper is the central Dipper of Heaven, from which all qi is bestowed. Thus, as the heart of Heaven, these methods originate therefrom, sharing their lineage with the Orthodox Unity tradition and serving as the pivotal mechanism for exorcism and governance.\n\nSince ancient times, Master Rao Jun’s *Register of Hidden Merits* has been revered in celestial intent, with divine talismans conferred and secret oral instructions received upon the Purple Empyrean. The transmission of these methods has been passed down through successive lineages, thereby illuminating them for the world. Whether for summoning blessings, dispelling malevolence, discerning the principles of yin and yang, or distinguishing the affairs of the unseen and manifest realms, no matter is left unaddressed. The methods are concise in application, and none surpass these in efficacy.\n\nIn recent times, scholars of lofty conduct, aiding Heaven’s transformative work and assisting the nation to save the people, have particularly esteemed these methods. Yet in their application, some have found their efficacy lacking. This is due to transmissions that fail in profound erudition, studies that do not delve deeply into the ultimate techniques, Dao-powers that remain incomplete, and divine marvels that are scarcely prepared. Merely entangled in names and forms, how can such efforts yield benefit?\n\nI have therefore meticulously compiled the foundational methods along with their secret oral instructions, gathering talismans and seals, outlining the steps for pacing the Dipper’s network, and exhaustively elucidating the essentials of its peripheral connections and hidden mysteries. Obscure principles are clarified, and extant texts are briefly expounded, valuing practice and conveying the subtleties of the primordial and wondrous. May this work, in its dissemination, serve as an inexhaustible ford for those who traverse it.\n\nAccording to the statutes, the Heavenly Heart Orthodox Methods and the Supreme Clarity secret instructions require, for all transmissions, adherence to the prescribed time limits, declaration of the ritual protocols, and verification of the responses from the true and numinous. Only then may they be applied; unauthorized transmission is strictly forbidden. Violations of these prohibitions will not only render the divine qi ineffectual but also incur penalties from both the unseen and manifest realms, with calamities that are by no means light.\n\nThe protocols for transmission and ordination are set forth in the subsequent scrolls. Scholars should examine these with care.\n\n*Prayers, Supplications, and Exorcisms*\n\nWhen a nation prays for rain, whether enduring prolonged drought or suffering from locusts and pestilence that harm the people, or when baleful stars align with its astrological regions, or when border raiders invade its territory and enemy forces press near, or when flood dragons and water spirits capsize boats and sweep away lives—such matters, great or small, all require urgent memorials to Heaven, petitioning the Heavenly Hosts for extermination, and submitting writs to the celestial star palaces, the Five Peaks, the Four Watercourses, the Four Seas, the Nine Rivers, and the dragon deities. Dispatches must also be sent to the local city gods, the spirits of mountains, rivers, and roads governing the affected regions, as well as to the Six Dings, Six Jias, and the Cloud and Thunder Departments. The presiding spirit-officials must be duly appointed, or if commoners submit petitions, they shall declare that within such-and-such a domain, for such-and-such a matter, a ritual platform has been established at such-and-such a place, with the altar prepared in reverent anticipation. Once the response is manifest, a grand jiao offering shall be conducted to express gratitude for Heaven’s grace. The memorial shall record the dispatched officers and soldiers, who upon their return shall be rewarded with promotions and ranks as proof of efficacy. The rituals must be performed with utmost sincerity to ensure a clear and potent response; negligence or laxity will result in impeachment by the Four Offices, scrutiny by the Three Officials, and punishment for violating Heaven’s statutes—a crime that admits no pardon.\n\n**Treating Madness and Malevolent Spirits**\nTo treat afflictions caused by madness or malevolent spirits, first obtain a sworn statement from the afflicted detailing the circumstances. Based on the nature of the case, determine the appropriate authorities to petition. Begin by issuing a writ to the afflicted’s household Controller of Destiny and the Five Paths Earth God, then dispatch a memorial to the local prefectural or county city god. Alternatively, petition the relevant celestial battalion to capture the spirit, or memorialize Heaven to establish a celestial prison for its confinement. All official documents and dispatched troops must first be accompanied by offerings; only then shall writs, passes, and summons be issued for execution. Next, provide the afflicted with talismanic water for ingestion and wearing. After the grace is received, reward the soldiers again and conduct a vegetarian feast or jiao offering to thank Heaven for its divine favor. The scale of the jiao offering should be commensurate with the family’s wealth—modest for the poor, lavish for the rich. If the family is truly impoverished and unable to prepare the offerings, the master shall provide them on their behalf. Should the wealthy, after receiving grace, begrudge their wealth and fail to offer thanks, thus dishonoring the soldiers’ merit, they shall incur misfortune that cannot be exorcised or resolved.\n\n**Mountain Imps and Spectral Beings**\nMountain imps are unorthodox spirits of the Five Phases, falsely claiming to be sages, seducing women, stirring waters, setting fires, hurling bricks and stones, tormenting livestock, manifesting eerie lights, assuming living forms, roaming day and night, and terrifying people—all manner of strange phenomena. First, examine the petition to assess the severity of the harm. For cases of grave concern, follow the above procedures: urgently memorialize Heaven and petition the relevant sacred peak for troops, or dispatch a writ to the local city god. The methods employed—including rewards—shall adhere to the preceding examples.\n\n**Transmission of Corpse Qi and Recurring Afflictions**\n\nTo sever the transmission of corpse qi and recurring afflictions, and to dissolve curses and maledictions, first obtain a written statement from the afflicted. It should state: the illness suffered by the person, the names of family members who previously died of the same illness on such-and-such a year, month, and day, or how many others later perished from it—all deceased must be listed by name. If the family has performed any meritorious deeds or held memorial rites that have not yet yielded results, immediately submit an urgent memorial to Heaven and petition the Eastern Peak, requesting a writ be sent to the Earth Prison to grant leave for messengers to escort the deceased to the Terrace of Heavenly Ascent, where their traces may be revealed and they may receive the scriptures and methods.\n\nConduct a Yellow Register Daoist ritual for several days and nights. Bathe, prepare paper garments, set out offerings, and receive the precepts. Burn the talismans of the Dragon Youth and transmit the True Talisman of the Most High for Salvation from Suffering. Present memorials and petitions, listing the names of the deceased for deliverance. Upon completion of the fast, dispatch the Four Upright Messengers with the fast’s certificate and the altar’s writ to escort the deceased to the Earth Prison, where they shall meet with the Merit Bureau and the officials of the Heavenly Ascent Case to receive rebirth according to the established rites.\n\nAfter rewarding the troops, perform the *Xiagai* Rite to permanently sever future afflictions, and provide the afflicted with talismanic water to swallow and wear. If the deceased frequently appear in dreams to cause harm, possessing the living and explaining matters, and if they are not external ghosts, then meritorious deeds must be performed to assist their ascent to the realm of the living.\n\nFor cases where the haunting is caused by deceased senior relatives or close kin, perform memorial rites to ensure mutual deliverance for the living and the dead, preventing further harm. Upon resolution, reward the troops as in the preceding examples.\n\nFor curses and maledictions that have caused death, perform meritorious deeds commensurate with the family’s wealth. After redemption is complete, submit a memorial to halt the curses permanently. Do not invoke the talismanic shrines; ensure the curses are severed for all time.\n\n**Dispelling Epidemics**\n\nTo expel the ghostly legions of pestilence—afflictions such as febrile illnesses, heat diseases, smallpox, red eyes, mouth sores, the five types of malaria, alternating chills and fever, madness, diarrhea, and dysentery—where medicine has failed and prayers have gone unanswered: first obtain a truthful statement from the afflicted and submit it to the relevant authorities, or urgently memorialize Heaven. Command the performance of a jiao offering to repent and expiate transgressions before providing talismanic water to swallow and wear.\n\nIssue a writ to the Twelve Year-Kings to restrain the advance of the epidemic, preventing the spread of poisonous drugs and toxic qi. Seal the household with a protective talisman and perform the *Xiagai* Rite to ensure the family is forever free from pestilence. Reward the troops and send off the ghostly legions of pestilence to distant lands. On the day the crisis is resolved, hold a jiao offering to thank Heaven for its grace and protection.\n\n**Praying for Offspring**\n\n**Praying for Offspring**\n\nWhen a couple has been married for many years without bearing sons or daughters, or when children die in infancy, or when only daughters are born and no sons, or when young children perish prematurely—this may be due to the mutual affliction of the Six Harms, encountering solitary stars or barren constellations, or the accumulation of past misdeeds making it difficult to continue the lineage. In such cases, the birth years, months, days, and hours of the husband and wife must be recorded and urgently memorialized to Heaven, while also submitting a petition to the Register of Births and the Eastern Peak. A special request shall be made to bestow a son upon the petitioner. Talismans shall be issued for swallowing and wearing, and the couple must be instructed to perform meritorious deeds in advance, such as commissioning sacred images, and await the response of divine grace. Once the blessing is received, a vegetarian feast and jiao offering shall be held to thank the Perfected Ones for their benevolence.\n\n**Expiating Disasters and Illnesses**\n\nTo expiate disasters and repent of transgressions: when years of calamity and suffering confine one to bed, when medicine and food fail to cure, when prayers go unanswered—this may be due to the influence of stars and planets, the harm of vengeful spirits, violations of earthly taboos, or the karmic retribution of past deeds in this life, provoking Heaven’s censure and the false accusations of ghosts below. For those seeking expiation, repentance must come first. Hold a vegetarian feast, perform a jiao offering, present memorials, and submit petitions, hoping that the sagely Dao will take pity and absolve their faults. Only then may the crisis be resolved.\n\n**Destroying Unorthodox Shrines**\n\nTo destroy unorthodox shrines: these refer to deities not recognized in the state’s sacrificial canon, those who cling to trees and grass or lurk in springs and pools—wild specters and mountain spirits that harm people and things, demanding bloody sacrifices, spreading illness, and bringing every kind of misfortune. If complaints are filed, a petition shall be submitted to the Eastern Peak and urgently memorialized to Heaven, dispatching heavenly soldiers to capture and punish these deceitful and disorderly spirits. Their shrines shall be burned, and they shall be tried according to the law. If a private shrine, sustained by incense offerings, brings blessings to the local people, a petition with the testimony of community elders and neighbors shall be submitted to Heaven, requesting permission to rebuild the shrine and allow the people to continue their worship.\n\nAccording to the statutes on governing ghosts, official temples dedicated to deities in the state’s sacrificial canon must not be used to solicit private offerings, secretly accept bloody sacrifices, or permit curses that wrongfully seize living souls, imprisoning them and driving people to drown themselves, leap into fires, or inflict self-harm, abandoning their livelihoods and stirring up lawsuits. For all illnesses, misfortunes, and losses of family wealth, complaints may be filed with detailed accounts, and once verified, petitions shall be submitted to await divine response and enforcement. If living people have inadvertently offended the principles of the gods, bringing misfortune upon themselves, they may confess and make amends, but the gods must not harm the lives of the people. Even if offenses are grave, repentance shall still be permitted.\n\n**Miscellaneous Malevolent Qi and Other Matters**\n\nWhen ghosts and various malevolent entities spread pernicious qi, spoiling wine and vinegar, or when taboos are violated, causing household unrest; when ancient tombs are excavated and buried corpses cause harm; when livestock behave strangely, devouring their own young; when insects and rats cry out unnaturally, hens crow at night, or snakes and ants release venom into homes; when knives, spears, rods, and swords make phantom noises; when ghosts appear at night, filling the heart with terror; when spirits open and close doors, strike objects, arrange cups and utensils for feasts, or drive people to throw themselves into wells or hang themselves; when they make people weep or sing, or fill them with sorrow and discontent; when they dissipate family wealth, borrow others’ clothes, or set fires to burn homes; when they call out people’s names, or malevolent qi enters their hearts and bellies, causing nightmares, ghostly apparitions, and sleep disturbances; when they provoke lawsuits and disputes, discord between husband and wife, or difficult childbirth; when they ruin fields and silkworms, prevent crops from flourishing, cause merchants to suffer losses, or obstruct all endeavors; when ghosts and spirits gather in new homes, whirlwinds enter dwellings, foxes cry out in confusion, or large trees fall without wind; when cauldrons wail and overflow, household objects move on their own, or infants cry at night, disrupting the harmony of men and women; when servants flee, livestock die of plague, or ghosts appear in broad daylight, manifesting in eerie sounds, lights, and illusions—these myriad demonic harms and destructive forces are too numerous to recount in full.\n\nHere, a few examples are given so that it may be known that the law contains statutes to subdue them. No matter how great or small the matter, there are regulations to address it. However, if the handling of such cases lacks evidence and verges on deception, they shall not fall within the scope of enforcement. After receiving divine grace, the rites of rewarding the troops and offering thanks must be performed according to one’s means, and the rituals must not be entirely neglected.\n\nThe gods are not distant; they are before our very eyes and ears. If one fails to believe and instead mocks or profanes them, the sins will extend to past generations, the calamities will befall descendants, and disasters will arise swiftly—by then, regret will be too late.\n\nThe above excerpts from the statutes of the law are compiled into these several sections, clearly categorized and explained, easy to understand. They are illustrated and made known to the people. Those who suffer and seek remedy shall follow them without doubt. Those who disbelieve and profane them shall study and reflect, that they may come to repent.\n\nHere the Dao acts as Heaven’s deputy to succor all beings—demands for wealth or property must not be made lightly. Should any petition for life or submit in sincerity, the statutes and ordinances must never be slighted or delayed. All who come to this court to file petitions or request talismanic water shall thoroughly study and understand these instructions.\n\n*Tai Shang Zhu Guo Jiu Min Zong Zhen Mi Yao*, Scroll One (end)\n[Note: The character *ze* 責 was originally written as *gui* 貴; emended here according to context.]\n\n*Tai Shang Zhu Guo Jiu Min Zong Zhen Mi Yao*, Scroll Two\nCompiled by Dongyou Master Yuan Miaozong of the Supreme Purity Northern Culmen Heavenly Heart Orthodox Rites, under the Dipper’s Numinous Writs and Incantations\n\n**Essential Methods for Preserving Stability and Dispensing Cures**\nFor averting epidemics, treating critical illnesses, severing consumptive *qi* transmission, subduing frenzied or demonic spirits, and dismantling improper talismanic shrines: first purify oneself, light incense, complete the pacing of the stellar net, transform into the divine form, and silently offer reverent invocation to the Supreme Purity Northern Culmen Great Emperor. Then pace the Dipper’s net, recite the Dipper incantation, and upon reaching *Po Jun* (Breaking Army), recite the *Celestial Net Great Sage Incantation*. After releasing the Dipper mudra, proceed with the *Heavenly Marshal Mudra*.\n\nNext, face the Four Seasonal Palaces to pay homage to the Jade Emperor. Record the circumstances and abridge the details, then submit the memorial according to protocol and await the Jade Emperor’s decree. Proceed to the afflicted household, dispatching two divine generals to follow. At the household’s gate, invoke the divine transformation phrase to summon the generals, employing both the *Celestial Emperor Mudra* and *Heavenly Marshal Mudra*. Envision the petitioner as the *Four Upright Merit Officers* and the *Generals of the Six Ding and Six Jia*, accompanied by the local earth deity. Then select and activate the necessary mudras for the task at hand.\n\n**Dipper’s Seven Stars Method for Dispelling Malevolence**\nEnvision the Northern Dipper’s stars overarching and pressing down upon one’s head, the net’s handle pointing forward. Imagine the arms, elbows, and chest forming a Dipper constellation. Then pace the Northern Dipper’s Seven Kings into the household, beginning with *Tan Lang* (Greedy Wolf), the net’s handle pointing ahead. Proceed to the main hall and take a seat.\n\nEnvision oneself as the Envoy of the Northern Culmen Demon-Quelling Court, the left hand holding the *Seal of the Great Dharma Master of All Heavens*, the right hand wielding the *Samadhi Fire Bell Sword*, clad in the regalia of the *Three Heavens Orthodox Unity Perfected*: the *Jiaotai* crown, fish-scale robe, and vermilion shoes with raven talons. To the left and right, envision the *Four Heavenly Kings*, the *Eight Great Vajras*, the *Twelve Great Spirits* of the twelve earthly branches, the *Generals of the Six Ding and Six Jia*, the *Two Merit Officers* of the current day and hour, and the *Earth Deity* of the locale.

The two divine generals and the day-and-hour merit officers stand to the left and right. Then employ the *Celestial Emperor Mudra*.\n\nNext, perform the *Divine Transformation Mudra* and recite the incantation. For dispatch, press the *Celestial Emperor Mudra* with both hands, clicking the teeth thirty-six times. Then pace the stellar net as usual, softly intoning:\n\n*\"The disciple of the Tai Shang’s register of rites, [Name and Rank], respectfully summons the Year Spirit, the Monthly General, and the officers and soldiers of the Six Jia. At this day and hour, the divine generals of the register’s direct talisman, the thousand-strong army of Dharma-assisting generals, and the cavalry of the Six Ding officers of the day—all descend together. The marching spirits deploy their *qi*.\"*\n\nClick the teeth seven times, then recite:\n*\"Seal the Divine Transformation Mudra and intone the Divine Transformation Incantation:*\n*I am no mortal form—*\n*My head resembles dark clouds,*\n*My hair like scattered stars.*\n*My left eye is the sun,*\n*My right eye the moon.*\n*My nose is a fire bell,*\n*My ears golden chimes.*\n*My upper lip is the Rain Master,*\n*My lower lip the Wind Earl.*\n*My teeth are a forest of swords,*\n*My ten fingers like merit officers.*\n*I command the Lord of Min Mountain to my left flank,*\n*The Lord of Lu Mountain to my right flank.*\n*I command the Thunder General of the Left to my left foot,*\n*The Lightning General of the Right to my right foot.*\n*I command the Lord of Mount Tai to my spine.*\n*The Thirty-Six Beasts and Twenty-Eight Constellations—*\n*All respond to my body.*\n*Hasten, hasten, as the statutes command!\"*\n\n**Recognizing the Sacred Images of the Rites**\n*The Northern Culmen Five Numinous Elder Lord*: Radiant in a dark crown and feathered robes, resembling the full moon’s orb, within which appears an emperor, faintly flanked by jade maidens.

Upon receiving commands, he acts immediately and reports back upon completion.\n\nThe Assistant Divine Generals: Holding yellow battle-axes, riding white horses, bearing yellow embroidered banners, clad in armor and robes like the Commanding General. United in purpose, they lead officials and soldiers to protect the ritual master. In rescue, capture, or punitive actions, they collaborate in strategy, transmit orders, discipline the troops, and ensure victory. Upon receiving commands, they act and report back.\n\nTwo Commanding Generals, ten Deputy Generals, twenty Company Commanders, five Dragon Spirits, five Sacred Peak Lords, and a thousand elite soldiers.\n\nOne Master of Ceremonies, two Registrars, twelve Bureau Officers, four Day Functionaries, and one Earth Deity.\n\nThe ten Deputy Generals: Of varying appearances, each ten feet tall, wearing helmets, golden armor, and holding bows, arrows, spears, and swords, each with five-colored banners, riding horses.\n\nThe two Commanding Generals lead their troops, surrounding and capturing enemies, executing punishments, and obeying the orders of the Commanding General to rally the ranks, ensuring might and valor.\n\nTwenty Company Commanders, clad in silver helmets and interlocking armor, wielding sharp weapons. Each stands nine feet and five inches tall, sometimes mounted, sometimes on foot. They constantly assist the ten Deputy Generals in driving and commanding their units, shaking the earth with their might, responding swiftly to duties, and striving to achieve merit and accomplish tasks.\n\nFive Dragon Spirits, corresponding to the five, are ever tasked with restraining and commanding the dragon deities to safeguard the Daoist arts. Should this court perform rites to pray for rain, aiding the state and benefiting the people, they lead and summon the dragons to ensure timely rainfall. If this court captures and executes malevolent spirits, they demolish lairs and temples, level mountains and marshes, sweep away evil spirits, and spread flourishing qi to subdue monsters and banish demons.\n\nTwo Valiant Guardsmen of the Left and Right, responsible for establishing the penal dungeons and personally providing protection. Nine Wardens of the Nine Prisons: when this court imprisons and interrogates spirits and deities, each leads their divine soldiers to ensure strict confinement, allowing no escape, manifestation of form, or revelation of sound or appearance. They promptly report and transfer the released prisoners to the appropriate authorities. Each must hold implements such as staffs, cangues, fetters, and whips for binding and punishment.\n\nOne thousand elite soldiers, each nine feet tall, dressed in multicolored garments, wearing bronze helmets and iron armor, each bearing weapons, bows, and swords. They are organized in units of five, with five units forming a squad, four squads under a Deputy General, and two squads under a Company Commander. All are heroic, brave, fierce, and agile, capturing demonic thieves and subduing malevolent spirits. Should evil ghosts or fiends dare to resist, they ready their weapons and exert all efforts to execute and slay them, striving to establish merit. The Deputy Generals and Company Commanders clearly instruct their units, ensuring no negligence or slackness.\n\nOne Master of Ceremonies at the Altar, wearing the ancient *dafu* cap, the ancient *dafu* robes, a sword, and holding a tablet, with ceremonial shoes. They inspect and discipline the generals, officers, and soldiers, ensuring strict order. They maintain constant vigilance in ceremonial propriety.\n\nShould rescue or capture be required, the generals, officers, and soldiers are to be promptly assembled. Those with merit shall be rewarded, while offenders shall face no pardon.\n\nOne Registrar of the Military Bureau attends, with four Executive Officers, to maintain the rosters and numbers of the troops. For all generals, officers, and soldiers engaged in punitive expeditions, rescues, or healings, they record merits and transgressions, standardize reports, and submit them for strategic consideration. A Co-adjutant may be appointed to assist in deliberation and execution.\n\nEight Attendant Officers follow the commanding general, managing miscellaneous affairs. Some hold designated duties, while others serve without fixed posts, dispatched as needed to transmit orders. Four Timekeepers on duty, assigned by year, month, day, and hour, assist with elite troops. They ensure strict confidentiality in strategic matters, summon spirits, relay commands, receive and present documents, submit memorials, and handle official correspondence. They facilitate clear communication and responses without delay.\n\nOne Altar Earth Deity attends, overseeing the land wherever the Bureau travels, governing the spirits within its jurisdiction. Upon receiving directives from the Institute, they transmit orders, summon spirits to search for and apprehend malevolent entities, and relay official documents. The Bureau’s authority extends to isolating and suppressing evil persons, tigers, wolves, venomous snakes, defilements, inauspicious omens, lingering corpses, and pernicious *qi*, meticulously inspecting and eradicating them without fail.\n\nOne Supervisor of the Military Kitchen oversees the Institute’s food and provisions. For all banquets and meals, utmost care is taken to ensure purity and cleanliness, driving away rats, ants, flies, insects, cats, dogs, and all impurities. Should demonic thieves conceal themselves or commit defilement, they are to manifest divine might to instill fear and awe.\n\nEach role bears its own responsibility, and thus none may be absent.\n\n**Incantation for Dispatching the *Gongcao* Spirits**\n\nSummon the *Gongcao* Attendant on duty this day, heed my words.\nBy decree of the Supreme Heaven, I assist in the Dao’s transformation, aid the state and save the people, cure illness and expel demons, sever evil and establish rectitude.\nWhen I dispatch you to Heaven, go swiftly to the Celestial Bureau.\nWhen I dispatch you to Earth, proceed directly to the Underworld.\nWhen I dispatch you to Water, enter at once the Water Palace.\nWithin the Three Realms, all malevolent spirits and ghosts—regardless of rank—must be swiftly seized wherever they lurk.\nI now cure illness and expel demons; delay not.\nReceive this written command, dare not disobey, and carry it out with reverence.\n*Hasten, hasten!* I await you before the altar, sword planted firm.\n\n**Incantation for Dispatching the Local Earth Spirit**\n\nSpirits of Heaven, spirits of Earth, where Heaven and Earth converge.\nReceive this missive, Earth Spirit—tarry not.\nGo swiftly, return swiftly; I await you before the altar, sword planted firm.\n\n**Method for Inscribing Talismans**\n\nBefore inscribing a talisman, first notify the Attendant Spirits of the Three Realms, declaring the purpose of this summons.\nMay all the Great Saints within the talisman descend in majesty, infusing the brush with their radiance.\nWhen inscribing talismans for others or practicing self-cultivation—whether pacing the stars or treading the Dipper—observe the yin-yang days.

Scrape away the charred bark where burned, face south to transform into spirit, and make the mudra of your original master. Draw in the true qi of the Southern Fire Star, inhale one breath into your mouth, and blow it onto the tip of the stick. Inhale again and hold the breath, then inscribe the following twenty characters upon it. Place it beneath the bed, driving it into the moon’s broken phase. Take care to avoid disturbance.\n\n*I possess a fire-stirring rod,\nWhich I appoint as gatekeeper.\nSeizing the night-crying ghost,\nI shall not release it till dawn.*\n\nThere is a talisman—transmitted orally and imprinted upon the heart.\n\n**Method to Halt Headaches**\nUse the Three Lights Talisman and affix it to the temples. Then draw in the qi of Heavenly Rigor, exhaling upon it three times. The pain will immediately cease.\n\n**Method to Dispel Swelling Toxins**\nMake the Dipper Mudra and silently recite the Three Lights Incantation seven times. Draw in the qi of the Three Lights and exhale upon it three times. The swelling will naturally disperse. The same applies to injuries from poisonous snakes or creatures.\n\n**Method to Treat Red Eyes**\nFirst transform into spirit and make the mudra of your original master. Draw in the qi of the Two Lights and infuse it into water. Then shout once, make the Dipper Mudra, and recite the incantation:\n\n*Oṃ vajra riyaye □ḍa,\nYou are Li Gongzhong,\nWhy have you come to my home?\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\n\nRecite it three times, shout three times, and use the water to rinse the eyes.\n\n**Method to Suppress Malaria**\nFirst transform into the Star Officials Zhang and Yi—each a hundred feet tall, clad in green cloud-scarves, wielding jade tablets, dwelling in the south, and governing malaria ghosts. The ancestral name of the malaria ghost resembles that of the Black Grief ghost. Use the Dipper Mudra to write these six characters on paper money, then brush the patient three times before burning it outside the door. Visualize the petitioner as the Day Officer of Divine Merit for that day, face north to burn incense, and rewrite the names of the seven stars of the Dipper, having the patient swallow them. The illness will immediately cease. Also write the character \"general\" and bind it to the patient’s left middle finger for males or right for females. The master should press the character \"flower\" onto the talisman. Once the malaria ceases, burn the talisman with paper money outside the door. Boiling peach branches into a decoction and adding the Three Lights Talisman is especially effective. Visualize the Star Officials Zhang and Yi capturing and severing the ancestral name of the malaria ghost, which resembles the Black Grief ghost. Recite the incantation fourteen times.\n\n**Childbirth-Hastening Talisman (Also Effective Against Rats)**\nTake a cypress stick four inches long and three fingers wide. Place a brush at the Heavenly Gate, burn incense toward the broken phase, then stand with both feet together, first opening the front (called \"Opening the Heavenly Gate\") and then the back (called \"Closing the Earthly Door\"). Sit at the Xun position, facing Qian, and make the Mudras of the Pleiades and the Sun. Visualize yourself within the mouth of the Northern Dipper, drawing the true purple qi of the Star Giant Gate and channeling it down to infuse the brush. With one breath, inscribe the talisman. Hang it within the birthing chamber, but ensure the pregnant woman does not see it before labor, lest it disturb the fetus.\n\n**Talisman Design:**\nFor hastening childbirth, inscribe the talisman on a three-inch square of paper. Visualize the Four Commanders of the Four Directions—clenched fists, heads bound with black cloth, wearing crimson robes with wide sleeves—arraying demon-quelling thunder, lightning, and fire chariots. Bite down on the talisman, silently recite the incantation seven times:\n\n*Heaven and Earth unite,\nSun and Moon unite,\nHuman and ghost unite.*\n\nRecite this once with a single breath. Then visualize the talisman’s soldiers—thunder, lightning, and fire chariots—entering the abdomen with the talisman. Swallow it with freshly drawn water. For males, hold it in the left hand; for females, the right, and expel it from the hand.\n\n**Master Xu’s Incantation for Water to Treat Illness**\n*Southern Celestial Pivot,\nNorthern Dark Warrior,\nEastern Old Lord,\nWestern White Tiger,\nHeavenly Elder,\nEarthly Matriarch.\nDivine water of the Five Directions,\nDescend and manifest your register!*\n\nFirst recite the incantation ten thousand times; thereafter, seven times suffice. For all incantations, first make the Thunder Duke’s Mudra and recite it twenty-one times in one breath. Draw in the qi of the Five Directions and Heavenly Rigor, infusing it into the water. This method may be applied to all illnesses, yielding great merit. Using it alongside the Three Lights Talisman is especially efficacious.\n\n**Thunder Duke’s Mudra**\nRaise the left hand, clasp the right. Hook the left hand’s fourth finger around the right hand’s third finger. Press the right hand’s second finger onto the left hand’s fourth finger. Hook the left hand’s third finger around the right hand’s fourth finger. Press the back of the left hand’s fifth finger against the back of the right hand’s fourth finger at the middle joint. Hook the right hand’s fifth finger around the left hand’s fifth finger. The left thumb presses the middle joint of the left hand’s second finger, while the right thumb presses the Zi character.\n\n*Thus concludes the second scroll of* The Supreme Essential Secrets for Assisting the State and Saving the People.\n*Here begins the third scroll of* The Supreme Essential Secrets for Assisting the State and Saving the People.\n\nMaster Dongyou’s Yuanmiao Zong Compilation:\n*Talismanic Methods for Dispelling Consumptive Wasting and All Diseases, Together with the Authentic Rites of Tianpeng for Beheading Demons*\n\n**On the Treatment of Consumptive Wasting**\n\nThe affliction of corpse-worms and transmitted ailments arises from the treatment of illness yet originates in indulgent desires. When indulgent desires remain unchecked, they lead to untimely demise. Though death may come early, if the celestial allotment of years has not yet expired, such deaths are deemed unjustly premature. Since the underworld has not yet summoned or constrained them, nor have they undergone karmic retribution, their ethereal souls linger in stagnation, unable to attain liberation. Thus, they transform into yin-demonic qi, infecting their kin through the bones. In most cases, they seek nothing more than to depend upon and draw from the qi of the living.\n\nThese worms consume a person’s essence and blood until emaciation sets in, spreading through the five viscera and causing unceasing convulsions. Often, entire clans are brought to ruin by this, a grievous sorrow indeed. In severe cases, neither medicinal remedies nor acupuncture can cure it. Even if Sangong were alive today or Hua Tuo reborn, how could they restore such patients?\n\nAlas, the people suffer innocently, unjustly drowned in calamity. Moved by compassion, Heaven has revealed the Daoist methods. As the scriptures state: *\"If the illness has not yet advanced deeply, and the joints remain unbreached, it may still be treated. But if the joints have already been passed, attempts at healing will prove futile. However, by applying this method, future afflictions may be averted.\"*\n\nFor those seeking deliverance, the afflicted household must provide a detailed written account, describing the patient’s initial onset of illness—its time, place, and cause—as well as any encounters with the deceased appearing in dreams, or connections to malevolent ghosts and demonic entities.\n\nIn performing these rites, sincerity and reverence are paramount. All ritual offerings, sacred gifts, and invocations of qi should be prepared according to one’s means, whether modest or generous. For impoverished households, the officiating master may provide the necessary items. Wealthier families should adhere to the prescribed rites and prepare the proper jiao offerings to repay Heaven’s grace.\n\nThe officiating master must guard against greed, never diverting ritual offerings for personal use. All received items should be dedicated to incense, scripture recitations, and the maintenance of sacred fires. Secondly, they should aid reclusive ascetics in the mountains and the destitute in the world. While adhering to proper protocols, one must not begrudge wealth or treat sacred arts with contempt, lest one profane the august sages and incur divine censure. The statutes are clear—this is a matter to be approached with utmost caution.\n\nBelow are the proven talismans, recorded in full:\n\n**Talisman for Severing Corpse-Infestation (to be ingested daily, with all forms of the talisman gathered in one scroll, written in cinnabar)**\n\n**Talisman for Slaying Transmitted-Wasting Worms and Annihilating Corpse-Demons**\nOnce the talisman is drawn, place it in a clean, plain vessel filled with pure water, setting it before the patient. Have another person hold the talisman and drop it into the water without disturbing it. If the talisman sinks within seven days, the wasting demons and corpse-worms will perish, and the illness will be instantly cured. If the talisman floats, recovery from the wasting disease will be delayed. This method is divinely efficacious and must not be transmitted to unworthy recipients.\n\n**Supreme Purple Court Talisman**\n\nWhenever inscribing the Supreme Purple Court Talisman, first burn incense and pace the Dipper’s steps. Clearly articulate the affliction at hand, then visualize the Five True Lords of the Five Directions—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—standing before the writing surface, each emanating radiance that transforms *qi* into the inkstone. The inkstone becomes a Black Dragon Pool, the ink a forest of halberds, the brush a divine sword. Then grind the ink forty-nine turns to the left while silently reciting the Heavenly Penetrating Spirit Incantation, exhaling *qi* into the inkstone. Next, grind forty-nine turns to the right, silently invoking the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Twelve Monthly Generals, the names of the Seven Stars, and the Spirit Lords of the Eight Trigrams, exhaling *qi* into the inkstone. Then envision the inkstone’s brilliance outshining the sun.\n\nThereafter, form the Jade Emperor’s mudra and recite the brush incantation:\n*\"Heaven is round, earth is square,\nSix pitch-pipes, nine chapters.\nWith one stroke of this divine brush,\nTen thousand demons vanish.*\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"*\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, tap the brush three times or draw three strokes upon the writing surface. When inscribing the talisman, if the day is yin, do so by daylight; if yang, by night. Disperse the form.\n\nA single *qi* blends into oneness, the Two Modes harmonize in peace.\nOne: Earth. Two: Water. Three: Fire. Four: Metal. Five: Wood.\nThe heavens are round—begin the stroke at the Gate of Heaven.\nThe earth is square—begin the stroke at the Earthly Portal.\n*Leihuo, Leihuo.*\nThe Six *Ding* spirits dwell on the left; the White Tiger’s might stands beside.\nThe Heavenly *Ding* warriors sever demons and inauspiciousness.\nMountain spirits, revenants, and transmitted afflictions vanish.\n\nTurn the *Leihuo* twice—Heaven and Earth brighten.\nThree turns—the Three Generals assist.\nFour turns—the Four Sages aid.\nFive turns—the Five Prisons lend strength.\nSix turns—ten thousand illnesses perish.\nSeven turns—the Seven Stars support.\nEight turns—the Eight Directions are subdued.\nBy the decree of the Jade Emperor, the Highest Lord of Heaven—*Gather the form.*\n\nWrite this talisman on a separate sheet of paper as before.\n**First, to sever transmitted afflictions:** Swallow the talisman after burning it in one place.\nIf desiring to ingest it, first sweep and purify a clean chamber. Place a lamp to the left for men, to the right for women, with half a cup of oil prepared. At the still of night, thread the talisman onto a needle, burn it to ash, and in a clean bowl, burn incense. Invoke the patient’s surname, birth month, age, the cause of their suffering, and the true sages of the talisman. Then mix the talisman ash with ritual water and consume it. Have the patient sit facing their life-direction, silent. One or two attendants should remain. Soon, the sufferer may seem to dream of ghosts departing—ask their names. Or if they see insects emerging from their body, swiftly seize the insects, fry them in the oil, and cast them into flowing water to forever sever transmission.\n\n**Incantation for Water to Treat Consumptive Illnesses and Miscellaneous Ailments (Universally Applicable):**\n*\"Water of the Great One, primordial and fine,\nRaise it to the mouth, divine radiance flows.\nFrom the large intestine, trickling to the bladder,\nIt scours the five viscera, entering the womb.\nA hundred illnesses heal, evil spirits flee,\nAligning with Heaven and Earth, the body light and strong.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"*\n\nFace the sun when reciting the incantation over the water by day, or gaze toward the Morning Star by night, silently repeating it seven times. Draw in qi and blow it into the water, then use it to harmonize talismans for expelling worms. After the patient’s worms emerge, they must consume the Talismans of the Three Lights and Five Thunders each morning and evening to purge accumulated malign matter from the five viscera. After a month, full recovery will follow—provided they perpetually abstain from anger, excessive desires, and all raw, oily, or greasy foods. This method is especially efficacious.\n\n**Five-Thunder Spirit Talismans**\nIn former years, your servant Miaozong received these Five-Thunder Talismans from a master and has employed them for over twenty years. They have cured critical illnesses, women’s ghostly pregnancies and ghostly qi, abdominal masses, transverse or stillborn fetuses, and all manner of demonic afflictions, saving countless sufferers from distress. Now, by the grace of the Sagely Emperor and the esoteric methods of the Dao, I dare not conceal them. I have meticulously compiled them here for transmission to later disciples—guard them well.\n\n**Dispersing Form**\nOpen the Gate of Heaven\nClose the Door of Earth\nLeave the Gate of Man\nSeal the Path of Ghosts\nPierce the Ghost’s Heart\nRupture the Ghost’s Belly\nAt the first revolution, thunder stirs\nAt the second, lightning strikes\nAt the third, Heaven and Earth move\nAt the fourth, the Four Sages appear\nAt the fifth, the Five Prisons assist\nAt the sixth, ten thousand illnesses vanish\nAt the seventh, the Seven Stars aid\nAt the eighth, the Eight Directions are subdued\nVisualize the thunder and fire of the southern direction, draw in the qi, and blow it onto the talisman. Envision the Flame Emperor of the South riding his ten-thousand-li fire chariot, gather the fire qi, and blow it into the talisman. Then recite the Six Stars to seal it.\n\nWhen ingesting the talisman, decoct seven peach leaves or seven peach kernels, face south, and swallow five pellets. All malign matter from the five viscera will be purged.\n\n**Dispersing Form**\nIf the illness is **above the heart**, direct the brush **upward** when drawing\nIf the illness is **below the heart**, direct the brush **downward** when drawing\n\n**Talisman for Seeing Ghosts and Spirits**\n\nFor the talisman on the right: before conducting the ritual, inscribe these three strips. When performing the ritual or offering sacrifice, swallow one strip. After completing the ritual or sacrifice, swallow two strips. First recite the incantation seven times, then swallow them. Even if their forms are not seen, the voices of ghosts and spirits may still be heard.\n\nIncantation:\nThe sun is my father,\nThe moon is my mother,\nThe Five Stars are my brothers.\nI wield the spirit talisman to subdue and gather ghosts and spirits.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances.*\n\n**Additional Talisman**\nAfter concluding the sacrifice, inscribe this talisman with cinnabar on paper beneath a lamp, burn it to ash, and place it in a bowl of water. Use it to wash the eyes, standing in stillness to see ghosts and spirits. Wash the ears with the water to hear the speech of ghosts and spirits. If harmed by ghosts or spirits, first employ this talisman—its efficacy is most potent. The incantation is the same as above.\n\nFor the **Yin Talisman** and **Yang Talisman**, inscribe them below the responsive talisman: on a yang day, write the Yang Talisman; on a yin day, write the Yin Talisman.\n\n**Concentrated Form**\nCentral Palace Great Sage\nFlying Immortals, swift and fleet\nYang Prison, prison ghosts, earthly realm, human realm—gather and subdue\nSever heads, break limbs—unrighteous ghosts and thieves, swiftly pass through and expel\n\nUpper Prime: General Tang\nMiddle Prime: General Ge\nLower Prime: General Zhou\n\n**Dispersed Form**\nYang Talisman\n\n**Dispersed Form**\nCentral Palace Great Sage\nFlying Immortals, swift and fleet\nYang Prison, prison ghosts, earthly realm, human realm—gather and subdue\nFive Directions sever heads, break limbs—unrighteous ghosts and thieves, swiftly pass through and expel\nUpper Prime: General Tang\nMiddle Prime: General Ge\nLower Prime: General Zhou\nPerfected Warrior Great Sage, Zhuoli Xiang\n\n**Concentrated Form**\nHeavenly One Spirit Talisman\n\n**Dispersed Form**\nHeavenly One Noble Spirit\nThree Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water\nMost High Lord Lao\nCentral Yellow Lord Lao\nI command a great army of one hundred thousand—\nSun, moon, and stars slay corpse-ghosts\nTwenty-Eight Constellations slay corpse-ghosts\nNine Bureaus’ Ghost Officials slay corpse-ghosts\nNine Luminaries and Void Conjunctions slay corpse-ghosts\nNine Palaces and Eight Trigrams slay corpse-ghosts\nFrom Horn to Chariot of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, lift the brush\nLeft: Azure Dragon\nRight: White Tiger\nFront: Vermilion Bird\nRear: Dark Warrior\nFour turns of the brush—each retains its true qi, blown into the talisman\n\n**Concentrated Form**\nFire Bell Talisman (all below pertain to miscellaneous healing talismans)\n\n**Dispersed Form**\nNuminous Treasure Heavenly Worthy\nMost High Lord Lao\nOne Million Spirits\nLeft: Azure Dragon\nRight: White Tiger\nFront: Vermilion Bird\nRear: Dark Warrior\nUpper Prime: General Tang\nMiddle Prime: General Ge\nLower Prime: General Zhou\nEighteen Constellations—\n\nWhen inscribing the Fire Bell Talisman, visualize transforming into fire until the chamber is filled. If bestowing it upon another, likewise envision flames preceding you.\n\n**Method of Burning to Ashes**\nMix with water and ingest, or wear the talisman to dispel all perverse afflictions. When employing it to inscribe talismans, recite the incantation:\n\nMost High Fire Bell, essence of the Flame Emperor\nLight and radiance flash like lightning, illuminating the Three Clarities\nFlowing fire for ten thousand miles—ghosts and thieves obliterated in form\nDivine seal once applied—perverse spirits reduced to ashes\nThree and Five Generals, Hakla Officers and Soldiers\nPacify heaven, relieve earth—unceasingly execute ghosts\nFlying talismans, swift seals—crowned with the Five Stars\nHurl fire to slay—ten thousand ghosts, one thousand spirits\nOld qi of the Six Heavens, entrusted to the Heavenly Ding\nFive Numinous Perfected Elders—my original masters\nUnobstructed divine penetration—ten thousand spirits return as one\nEvil ghosts annihilated, inauspicious ones pursued\nCentral August Nine Paths—might spreads to the Four Directions\nSubdue and conceal old qi—no trace, however minute, escapes\nFive Pestilences, Seven Afflictions—I decisively eradicate them\nWhat spirit dares oppose?

Consecrate the brush and inscribe the talisman, reciting the incantation:\n\nHeaven is round, Earth is square,\nSix Pitches, Nine Chapters.\nWith one stroke of the divine brush,\nTen thousand ghosts perish.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\n\n**Dispersed Form**\n\nOpen the Gate of Heaven, Seal the Door of Earth, Secure the Human Gate, Block the Ghostly Path, Pierce the Ghost’s Heart, Rupture the Ghost’s Belly.\n\n**First Revolution:** Gather the City Gods\n**Second Revolution:** Gather the Earth Gods\n**Third Revolution:** Gather the Three Generations of Ancestors\n**Fourth Revolution:** Gather the Four Directs of Year, Month, Day, and Hour\n**Fifth Revolution:** Gather the Five Voids and Six Wastages\n**Sixth Revolution:** Gather the Six *Ding* and Six *Jia*\n**Seventh Revolution:** Gather the Seven Ranks and Eight Seats\n**Eighth Revolution:** Gather the Wayless Ghosts and Spirits of the Eight Directions\n**Ninth Revolution:** Gather the Ghosts of the Nine Provinces and Their Corresponding Regions\n\nUpper Prime Tang General, swiftly seize the ghosts!\nMiddle Prime Ge General, swiftly bind the ghosts!\nLower Prime Zhou General, swiftly behead the ghosts!\n\n**Assembled Form**\n\nRecite again the incantation:\n\nThe Supreme Divine Blade slays,\nShaking the Three Thousand Realms.\nDharma-water flows into the heart,\nMyriad illnesses naturally disperse.\n\nTao Bin Nu is your father,\nBi Yang Nu is your mother.\nAct swiftly, act swiftly!\nIf you do not act,\nI shall dispatch the Heavenly Soldiers to come,\nStrike down your ancestors,\nAnd subject them to the Six Dusts.\n□□□□□□□.\nSwiftly, swiftly, by the Emperor’s decree.\n\nExecute the mudra and emit qi.\n\n**Summoning Soul Talisman**\n**Dispersed Form**\n\nOpen the Gate of Heaven,\nClose the Door of Earth,\nPreserve the Gate of Man,\nBlock the Path of Ghosts.\n□□□□□□□\nGreat Yin and Great Yang,\nThe Twenty-Eight Constellations,\nGreedy, Gigantic, Wondrous, Literary, Upright, Martial, Broken—\nThe Five Qi Spirit Turtle devours demons,\nDrawing each true qi to infuse the talisman.\n\n**Assembled Form**\n\n**Qi-Slaying Spirit Talisman**\nExecute the Mudra of the Northern Emperor.\n\n**Dispersed Form**\n\n*Tai* character: Heavenly Rigid Great Sage, Seven Qi.\n*Ye* character.\n*Sha* character.\n*Gui* character.\n*Yin Ri* character.\n*Yang Ri* character.\n*Ri Chi* character.\n*Yang Ri Chi* character.\nInscribe the above according to the Year-Mudra of the Divided Forms,\nDrawing each from its original qi.\n\n**Assembled Form**\n\nRecite the incantation:\nQi-Slaying Spirit Talisman,\nPacifies the dwelling and stabilizes the dragon.\nExpels the ghosts of the Five Pestilences and Seven Convulsions,\nNewly dead and long departed,\nMale and female transmission of corpse contagion,\nMountain specters and spring stones,\nThose clinging to grass or trees—\nAll manner of Wayless ghosts and spirits,\nIdle calamities and empty wastages,\nBy the Supreme Talisman’s arrival,\nSwiftly depart to another realm!\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command.\n\nDraw the true qi of the Northern Dipper and blow upon it.\n\n**Hastening Birth Talisman**\n**North**\n**Decree**\n**Swift**\n**Emit**\n\nFor each talisman, gather the Great Yang qi of the East and blow it in,\nExecute the Dragon Mudra,\nStarting from *yin*, dot to *shen*,\nDescend to *xu*,\nFlick *shen*—this is the method.\n\nRecite the incantation:\nSun’s emergent numinous light,\nIlluminates the ten directions.\nNurturing the tassel brings wealth,\nAligning with the Great Yang above.\nTransforming female to male,\nThe woman becomes strong.\nAll spirits are at peace,\nLifespan is prolonged.\nThe Birth Overseer stands before,\nThe Life Controller follows behind.\nHolding the talisman forth,\nHasten the birth, hasten the birth!\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Lord Emperor’s statute and command.\n\nDraw the qi of the Three Lights and blow upon the talisman.\n\n**Hastening Birth and Bone-Splintering Talisman**\nUse the Dipper Mudra.\nFor hastening birth, transform the spirit into the Great Spirit Overseer of Birth.\nFor dislodging bone splinters and all ailments within the abdomen,\nTransform the spirit into the Expeller of Evil, Court Enforcer.\n\n**Dispersed Form**\n\nOpen the Gate of Heaven,\nClose the Door of Earth,\nPreserve the Gate of Man,\nBlock the Path of Ghosts,\nPierce the ghost’s heart,\nRupture the ghost’s belly.\n□□□□□□□\nLeft Seven Assistants.\n\n**Assembled Form**\n\nUpon completing the talisman’s inscription, recite the incantation:\n\nI now command your body to instantly become the Child Overseer of Birth. For me, transmit the talisman forth—swiftly part mother and child. Swiftly, swiftly, as the Supreme Emperor decrees.\n\nWhen inscribing the talisman with the incantation, envision the recipient as the Child Hastening Birth. As you dispatch the talisman, observe the person receiving it, using left or right hand to discern the child’s sex. If the talisman is to be swallowed, use flowing water while facing north. When dispatching the talisman, employ the Thunder Duke Mudra.\n\n**Fire Wheel Talisman**\nInscribe on a Fire Day at noon; if a Fire Day cannot be awaited, any yang day will suffice. Transform the spirit into the Heavenly Master. With the left hand, form the Golden Spear Mudra, face the sun, and intone the Perfected Sovereign of Boundless and Unfixed Limit. Toward the sun, inscribe one fire character with the Golden Spear, reciting the True Sovereign of Fiery Virtue and Blazing Deluder of the Southern Direction. Inscribe another fire character, reciting the All-Responsive True Sovereign of the Red Emperor. Inscribe yet another fire character, then recite the Three True Sovereigns once more. Draw three streams of solar fire qi through the nose into the heart.\n\n**Dispersed Form**\nQian, Kan,\nGen, Zhen,\nXun, Li,\nKun, Dui.\nOne True Sovereign,\nRecite Two True Sovereigns.\nWith each stroke, intone *Fire Wheel General of a Hundred*.\n\n**Assembled Form**\nInscribe in cinnabar on paper strips. When dispatching the talisman, recite the Three True Sovereigns, envisioning the sun and the fiery qi of the southern direction blazing intensely, pouring into the talisman.\n\n**Heavenly Penetrator Salvation Method**\nThe Heavenly Penetrator is a general under the Northern Emperor. The scripture states: The Heavenly Penetrator’s original form is the ninth star of the Northern Dipper, the transformed body of the Golden-Browed Lord, who subdues demons and rescues living beings without distinction of sex. All may venerate him. Always on the fifth and twenty-fifth days of the month—days when the Heavenly Penetrator Great Sage descends—prepare a bowl of pure water, a sword, an incense burner, and a table. Burn incense according to the method. White glue or a decoction of cypress may also be used. Offer cakes, fruits, and flowers as one wishes. On the Three Primordial Days, light the Seven Stars Lamp and present an altar array of flowers and fruits. When performing prohibitions, first clench the fists, close the eyes to visualize the spirit, knock the teeth together, and sound the Heavenly Drum three times. While visualizing with eyes closed, transform the five viscera and five qi into the Five Spirits: Green Dragon on the left, White Tiger on the right, Vermilion Bird in front, Dark Warrior behind, the Seven Stars within the head, and the Qilin beneath the feet. The Three Terraces take form, the Celestial Rigidity faces forward, the three demonic paths are traversed, the Subduing Demon Mudra is formed, and evil ghosts are vanquished. When invoking, first visualize the sun on the left and the moon on the right, the Northern Ultimate Great Emperor in a dark crown and feathered robes, and the Seven Stars True Sovereigns in vermilion garments with crimson sashes. Next, visualize within the Northern Dipper the Perfected Ones and Jade Maidens, the Three Primordial Generals and officers, descending from the void in response to their corporeal forms. Then visualize the Heavenly Penetrator, Great Sage of the Golden Head, eight-faced and eight-armed, fifty *zhang* in height, clad in golden armor, wielding a sword, halberd, imperial bell, and spirit seal, leading thirty thousand cavalry. Thunder Masters and Lightning Masters, immortal youths and jade maidens, their feathered banners resplendent, each brandishing a golden sword, descend from the void to stand before and behind. Only then burn incense and make the invocation. To recite the Heavenly Penetrator’s divine spell, first knock the teeth together thirty-six times, then press the Heavenly Penetrator’s Ghost-Subduing Eye, located on the second joint of the left middle finger. Having pressed it, recite the incantation:\n\nHeavenly Penetrator, Heavenly Penetrator,\nNine Primes’ Slaying Youth.\nFive Ding Commanders, Tall Blade Northern Elder.\nSeven Governances, Eight Numinous Ones,\nSupreme Lord’s Vast Ferocity.\nLong-Fanged Giant Beast,\nGrasping the Imperial Bell.\nWhite Owl of the Three Vehicles,\nMounting the Mighty Kui Dragon.\nMighty Sword Spirit King,\nSlaying evil, eradicating traces.\nPurple qi rides the sky,\nCinnabar radiance blazes forth.\nDevouring demons, consuming ghosts,\nBody transverse, drinking the wind.\nBlue tongue, green teeth,\nFour-eyed Elder Nie.\nHeavenly Ding Force-Soldiers,\nMight of the South repelling ferocity.\nHeavenly Couriers, fierce and wrathful,\nMight of the North bearing blades.\nThirty thousand troops,\nGuard my ninefold layers.\nExpel corpses a thousand *li*,\nDispel misfortune and avert calamity.\nShould any petty ghost\nDare approach to witness this,\nHeavenly Great Axe,\nSevering the five forms of ghosts.\nFiery Emperor’s scorching blood,\nNorthern Dipper’s burning bones.\nFour Luminaries shatter the skeleton,\nHeavenly Strategy annihilates the kind.\nOne stroke of the divine blade—\nTen thousand ghosts scatter in rout.\n\nWhen uttering the word “slay,” recite it habitually. If one fears harming ghosts and spirits, omit the word “slay.” After ten thousand recitations, merit is accomplished. Whenever reciting this incantation, tap the teeth once for every four words as a regular rhythm—this is the discipline of cultivating the true. If reciting day and night, one need not tap the teeth for every four words. In cases of ghostly affliction, sit upright according to the method, tap the teeth once for every four words, or first tap seven times, recite three times, then tap seven more times, and earnestly state one’s heartfelt vow. The haunting ghost will then suffer darkened, rotting eyes and perish. This incantation is the Northern Emperor’s secret. If a person of this world obtains this incantation and method and practices it regularly, they may control all evils, augment spirit and qi, prolong life, avert misfortune, cross tribulations, exorcise calamities, rescue and protect living beings, and prevent unjust harm. Men and women, young and old, may all practice it. Those who cultivate and recite must wholeheartedly focus, without mixing in other methods or heterodox defenses, nor sharing the same chamber—these are all the malign spirits of the Six Heavens. To profane the numinous and upright, or to mock and deride the divine spells as mere common text, will incur the Heavenly Penetrator’s resentment, causing one to go mad, throw oneself into water or fire, suffer prolonged torment in the grave, or bring cascading misfortune upon one’s family, extending calamity to seven generations. One cannot be too cautious—do not treat true secrets lightly.\n\n**Heavenly Penetrator’s Ghost-Pursuing Method and Talisman**\nWhen someone comes to request a ritual master, first draw three breaths of the person’s qi, step the Dipper, and ascend to the Dipper’s mouth. Then point to the *chou* earthly branch of the Dipper, and from *wei* dispatch the command. Visualize the Dipper’s mouth covering the head, the Dipper’s handle pointing forward. Upon exiting the door, visualize a Heavenly Official! Issue the command to go forth first, then from *chen* dispatch the Heavenly Troops, and from *wu* dispatch the Earthly Troops.\n\nProceed thirty-six steps, then dispatch one Dipper, and summon the troops and generals of the Five Marchmounts and the Three Luminaries. Concurrently, dispatch the city gods, earth gods, bridge gods, and the deities of the five roads. Upon reaching the afflicted household’s gate, employ one Small Functionary Bureau, then use the Standing Tusk and Venom-Sealing Seal to mark the *zi-wu* Dipper.\n\nIf the ghost or spirit remains unresponsive, silently visualize the Black Sea, use the Iron Drum Seal, and envision the Terrace Press as a divine dragon. First visualize the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, then the city gods and earth gods, and afterward dispatch the troops and generals of the Five Marchmount Lords to search and reinforce.\n\nWhen inscribing the talisman, first draw the Heavenly Rigorous *qi* and hold it over the heart, transforming the body into the majestic presence of the Heavenly Penetrator Marshal, with the *kuilong* on the left and the Six *Jia* and Six *Ding* spirits on the right, accompanied by the six great duty-attending talisman messengers. Envision the brush as a sword, the paper as an iron tablet, grind the ink, and recite the Heavenly Penetrator Mantra five times. After each recitation, draw one breath of Heavenly Rigorous *qi* and blow it into the ink. Only when the brush is exhausted is the talisman complete.\n\n**Dispersed Form:**\nUpper Prime: General Tang\nMiddle Prime: General Ge\nLower Prime: General Zhou\nMajestic Presence: *Kuilong*\nPenetrator Marshal: Iron Pillar Lock\nHeavenly Penetrator Marshal: Glare of Wrath at Ghosts\nHeavenly Penetrator Marshal: Long Nail Piercing Ghost Eyes\nMarshal of Heavenly Troops and Horses\nThousand-Foot Venomous Dragon\nThousand-Foot Venomous Serpent\nMarshal’s Crossed Sword Severing Ghost Feet\n*Qian, Kan, Zhen, Gen, Xun, Li, Kun, Dui*—if you are a ghost or spirit causing misfortune and do not depart swiftly, you shall be delivered beneath my *Kuigang* to die by decree.\n\n**Assembled Form:**\nHeavenly Penetrator’s Thirty-Six Generals Talisman, Oral Formula, and Preface\n\nDuring the Great Tang, on Mount Magu—so named because the immortal Magu attained Dao there—there lived a man surnamed Zheng, styled Ziyang, who burned incense and studied the Daoist canon. On this mountain, he practiced the arts of Fengdu, dwelling in its grottoes for five years. Day and night he cultivated without the slightest slackening, reciting the Heavenly Penetrator’s divine incantations without pause. One night of the Upper Prime, the sky was serene, the moon bright as day. Ziyang burned incense and made his petition, praying for the descent of true numina. As he recited as before, suddenly a book descended from heaven—white silk inscribed in black characters, radiant with several beams of light—flying into his chamber before vanishing in an instant. Ziyang sighed in wonder, unable to fathom its depths. Resolving his intent, he sat upon a flat stone, closed his eyes, and as if in slumber, beheld a divine figure clad in armor, bearing a sword, who addressed him: “I am the Messenger of the Six *Ding* of the Northern Heaven. By the Celestial Emperor’s decree, I bestow upon you thirty-six talismans of the Black Script, two characters within them forbidden for use, all recorded herein.”\n\nThe Heavenly Penetrator’s Thirty-Six Talismans are now rarely practiced. Though the texts exist in the world, most appear as thirty-six isolated characters, lacking the secret art of their assembled forms. I once received these texts along with their composite forms, distinct from those in common circulation. When applied, they manifest extraordinary efficacy, and I have thus recorded them with care.\n\n**Heavenly Canopy**\nThis is the true talisman of the Heavenly Penetrator, Great Marshal of the Primordial.

Its efficacy and numinous wonders defy estimation. Formerly, nine talismans were customarily employed in transmission, while the remainder remained concealed, unseen and unheard.\n\nIn addition to the nine talismans, your servant has since obtained ten more. Reverently appending them to the present text, I have compiled a middle volume to further elucidate the fundamental principles and expand their wondrous applications. As for the regulations and statutes, they remain as in the original, and are recorded below.\n\n**Talisman of the Fiery Bell and Valiant General**\nWithin this scroll, the *Gathering Form Talismans*—except for the *Yin Talisman* written in black—are all to be inscribed in vermilion.\n\n**Dispersed Form**\nThe Jade Clarity Lord of the Highest Dao cleaves open the Gate of Heaven.\nSquare is the earth, round the heavens; follow my brush’s course:\nEnter directly into the *Kui Gang* of the left *Yin*, the *Kui* of the right *Yang*, the *Kui* of the left—seven revolutions.\nTang Hong, Ge Yong, Zhou Wu.\nMetal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—\nthe Perfected Lords of the Circumpolar Stars and the Constellations of the Celestial Circuit.\nThe Three-Foot Dragon King of the Thunderbolt, the Swift Thunder of the Great Unity,\nthe Flying Talisman Envoys—\nhurl heaven, cast earth, mount the fiery clouds.\nMount the heavens, wield the sword, swift and fierce—\nthe winds and thunders above.\nSpread the Heavenly Net above, lay the Earthly Snare below.\nToday’s Direct Talisman:\nThe Heavenly Officers of the Great Clarity, the Envoys of the Three Officials,\nproceed to [such-and-such] place to seize and capture the demonic ghosts.\n\n**Gathering Form**\nThe Talisman of the Great Unity’s Rushing Star for Seizing Demons.\n\n**Dispersed Form**\nMetal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—[...] the numinous, numinous follows my brush’s course.\nThe Six *Jia*, the Six *Ding*, the Officers of the Three Bureaus, the Four Generals—enter.\nHarness the solemn chariot of *Kui* dragons, bind them into iron pillars to stir their traces.\nThe Green Dragon on the left draws the *hun*-soul’s qi from [so-and-so],\nThe White Tiger on the right draws the *po*-soul’s qi from [so-and-so].\nThe Three Terraces bear me—*tsu-tsu!*\n\n**Gathering Form**\nFor these two talismans to be inscribed, first observe where the Celestial Rigidity resides in the heavens, and use yellow silk. On *yang* days, write in ink; on *yang* days, write in cinnabar. Pace the stars of the heavens to gather the qi of Celestial Rigidity. With the left hand form the Seal of the Purple Tenuity, and with the right hand raise the talisman.\n\n**Incantation:**\nCelestial Rigidity of the Seven Stars, divine soldiers of the Three Heavens—\nthe soldiers that overturn heaven and shake earth.\nGreat Demon Kings of the Three Heavens, Jade Clarity’s attendants,\nFlying Talisman Envoys—descend from heaven,\nfollow my talisman of the Supreme Perfected,\ntoday, at this hour,\naccompany this divine talisman to [so-and-so]’s household for [such-and-such] matter,\nto pursue and seize demonic ghosts.\nToday’s Duty Officer of the Merit Clerk, the Demon-Slaying Soldiers of the Northern Emperor,\nattend me on left and right.\nUse one guiding talisman to go together.\n\nHold the talisman and pace the Dipper from the Gate of Heaven to the Celestial *Kui*, then pace from the Earthly Door to Celestial Rigidity. Turn the body and re-enter [8A40], face [8A41], burn the talisman to ash, and knock the teeth seven times. Recite the previous incantation again. With the left hand grasp the talisman ash, and with the right hand wield the sword. Retreat three steps to stand upon the Net, then shout to the Talisman Envoys and Merit Clerks to proceed to [so-and-so]’s place without delay. Blow qi onto the sword and point it toward the desired direction, then spray water from the mouth.\n\nThis method can reach the Gate of Heaven, the Five Peaks, the Four Marshes, the Yangzi, the Yellow, the Huai, and the Ji—nowhere is it not efficacious. It may be inscribed on twelve feet of yellow silk, though this is not necessary for regular use. Whenever employed, it must be done according to the proper method. Its efficacy is great, and no other technique surpasses it—thus these two talismans are foremost.\n\n**Mountain-Shaking Talisman**\n**Dispersed Form**\n\nThis Heaven is my father,\nThis Earth is my mother,\nSun, Moon, and the Five Stars are my envoys.\nHeavenly Officials, Earthly Officials, Water Officials—\nSpring Thunder, Summer Thunder, Autumn Thunder, Winter Thunder,\nFlying Winds and Rushing Stones, Great Divine Kings,\nLegions of soldiers who overturn heaven and shake earth—\nTo the left, fire chariots rumble and crack,\nTo the right, fire chariots fly like swift lightning.\nOne stroke of the brush and mountains tremble,\nTwo strokes and poisonous dragons churn the sea.\nMountains quake, trees sway, the hundred valleys boil—\nWhat dares resist or disobey? □□□□□□□\n\n**Concentrated Form**\n**Great Dragon-Locking Talisman**\n**Dispersed Form**\n\nBy the decree of the Heavenly Honored One, the Supreme Emperor,\nBy the decree of the Jade Emperor, the Supreme Emperor,\nBy the flying riders of the Five Thunders,\nBy the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water,\nBy the Lord of the Sun and the Lord of the Moon,\nBy the soldiers of the Three Heavens and the steps of the celestial scribes,\nBy the Fire Generals of the Five Heavens—\nA single iron pillar, a thousand feet long,\nBlazing fire, Heavenly Ding spirits guard and protect.\nShould any water demon encounter this, it shall perish.\nIron platforms interlock, fierce thunder and fire chariots bind the dragon,\nCommand the dragon to spew water, then command it again.\nIron riders charge forth, cutting off the sea’s source—\nWhoever opposes this talisman shall be rendered formless.\nBy the decree of the Supreme Emperor, flowing gold and fire bells,\nMighty Heavenly Ding spirits, deliver this to the Water Emperor.\nHow dare you not comply? Today, I emit nine streams of qi to seal all.\n\n**Concentrated Form**\n\nWhen inscribing these two talismans, stand upon the Dipper’s Net during the moon’s established phase. Then observe where the celestial yang resides, draw in qi, hold the breath, reverse the qi’s flow, press the tongue against the upper palate, and clasp the middle joint of the left hand’s middle finger without releasing. Inscribe the talisman at the Dipper’s mouth while forming the mudra with the eyes.\n\nThe incantation reads:\n*Proceeding along the Supreme Clarity’s boundless Great Dao, I, the master of this method, reverently summon the Water Official, the Earth Official, the local Earth God, the Envoys of the Dao, the River Lords, and the Mountain Spirits. For [such-and-such] matter in [such-and-such] place, I solemnly command this talisman to seal the Three Rivers, to flow through the Five Seas and the boundaries of the earthly and watery realms. Should any demonic beings or portents from the water palaces arise untimely to harm the people below, I dispatch the divine generals of Dinghai, Dingchou, Jiaxu, and Jiashen, leading the soldiers who overturn heaven and shake earth, to follow this divine talisman. With a single strike, all shall be pacified, obeying my commands without fail.*\n\nKnock the teeth twenty-four times, then inscribe the **Mountain-Shaking Talisman** with the brush.\n\nOn twelve feet of crimson silk, when inscribing this talisman, shout loudly toward the mountain—it shall tremble, and spirits and gods shall flee in haste. To suppress dragon spirits and strange anomalies, inscribe the **Dragon-Locking Talisman** in seal script on an iron plaque twelve inches long and place it upon the riverbank’s wall—nothing shall pass. If cast into a lake or deep pool, any dragon or strange being that charges against the talisman shall die.\n\n**Supreme Clarity’s Flying Storm Seizing Spirit Talisman**\n**Dispersed Form**\n\nInvoke the **Three Terraces Mantra** as recorded in the second scroll. On a yin day of the lunar month, first inscribe the right eye; on a yang day, first inscribe the left.\n\n**Taiqing Wangdi Decree:**\nSummon the true qi of the Great Sun, the Celestial Pacifier, and the Great Demon King—let their qi enter the true qi. By the command of the Nine Heavens’ Great Marshal, Flying Immortals, Celestial Scribes, Heavenly Ding, and Mighty Warriors, seize them swiftly.\n\n**Left Origin, Great Unity, Sun, Moon, Stars, Three Officials, Lone Guardian General:**\nWith one qi, tally the sword; with two qi, mark the stars. The Seven Origins of the Northern Dipper—swift as lightning, fierce as gale and thunder—charge into heaven, arraying the battle formation. The Six Jia draw their bows, the myriad stars align, capturing and binding malevolent spirits. **Well**, **Ghost**, and **Willow** follow my brush’s course; those who resist are bound, those who oppose the Dao are beheaded. The Dipper’s Rampart, vast qi, governs my body and speech—swiftly, by command!\n\n**Concentrated Form**\n\nWhen inscribing this talisman, first trace the Dipper from your own life-star, transforming into an **Upper Clarity** Dharma Master. Then, within the Dipper’s mouth, step backward to the **Gang** position. Use twelve feet of white silk, inscribed in cinnabar. Draw the **Gang qi**, visualize it entering the cinnabar brush, and pinch the first joint of the middle finger. Burn incense with blazing fire and recite the invocation:\n\n*\"I humbly invoke the Three Masters at the Three Heavenly Gates, the martial officers and the Nine Heavens’ Great Marshal, the Great Unity True Officials, the Sun and Moon’s True Realm, the Celestial Pacifier and Great Demon King, the Heavenly Ding Warriors, the Six Jia arraying their formations. Command the Five Thunder Lords to dispatch flying talismans from the clouds, swift messengers—hasten, hasten! Descend from the Heavenly Gate, surge forth from the earth, spread the celestial net above, lay the earthly snare below. Chariots of blazing thunder, winds that scour the land—follow this divine talisman to swiftly proceed to [location], to seize and capture the malevolent ghosts or demonic entities causing harm. Present them before me without delay or obstruction. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by command!\"*\n\nRecite the mantra thrice before inscribing the talisman. Recite it once when dispatching the talisman. This talisman is employed in the same manner as the **Fire Bell Flying Swift Talisman**.\n\n**Yang Talisman**\n**Dispersed Form**\n\n**Taiyang Lord’s Talisman for the Day’s Directing Spirit**\n*For the designated day of the Taiyang Lord*\n\nOn a yang day, rotate left seven times while reciting [seven-character mantra].

On a yin day, rotate right seven times. Clench the *Moon Lord’s Mudra*. [Invoke:]\n**Yin-directing Prison Envoy—**\nOnce to rouse the thunderclap; twice to rouse starlight; thrice to rouse the generals; four times to drive ghosts and spirits to die beneath my brush.\n\n**Concentrated Form**\n\nThis talisman is divided by yin and yang days. For example, on a *jiǎzǐ* day (yang), use the Yang Talisman. On a *yǐchǒu* day (yin), use the Yin Talisman. It can annihilate ten thousand anomalies. Follow the method of pacing the Dipper and donning the *刚* [crown]: write in cinnabar on yang days, in ink on yin days. When grinding cinnabar or ink, on yin days draw the moon’s *qi*; on yang days, the sun’s *qi*.\n\n**Mantra:**\n*\"The Heavenly Way unfurls its net,\nDriving yin to expel yang.\nYin and yang’s true qi\nRush to my *Kuigang*.\nWith one touch of my talisman,\nTen thousand ghosts hide in concealment.\"*\n\nWhen dispatching the talisman on a yang day, clench the *Day Lord’s Mudra* and recite the Day Lord’s name seven times. On a yin day, clench the *Moon Lord’s Mudra* and recite the Moon Lord’s name seven times. Visualize true *qi* pouring into the talisman to expel ghostly *qi* and demonic essences. Affix the talisman to the forehead, and all ghosts and spirits will be obliterated.\n\n---\n\n**Shangqing Inverted Sea Rain-Inducing Talisman**\n*Source Lord’s Corpse traverses the Nine Rivers and Nine Streams*—[these eight characters are inscribed at the talisman’s base].\n\nTo inscribe this talisman for inducing rain, first submit a memorial to the Nine Rivers’ Water Emperors and the nearest river sources or spring caves. If the weather is naturally rainy, the yin spirits will respond of their own accord. If the weather is rainless, point toward river pools, deep ponds, or lakes, and separately state the circumstances in a petition to the Ancestral Master, the *Shangqing Great Emperor*, and the *Jade Sovereign of the Vast Heaven*, humbly beseeching a special decree to command the officials of the designated river source to await the talisman’s arrival and immediately provide relief by bestowing rain, dispersing it across the specified area with a fixed depth of [X] *chi*. *\"Humbly beseech your assent to this minister’s petition for implementation.\"*\n\nAdditionally, file a report to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water; address a writ to the *Thunder, Rain, and Lightning Department*, the *Tianding* warriors, the *Rain-Dragon Kings*, the *Wind Earl*, and the *Rain Masters*. Clearly describe the circumstances in the memorial and attach an official note to the designated area, instructing all water-bearing locations to await the talisman’s arrival for verification and immediate action. Conduct a Daoist ritual for three days, or five days.\n\nAfter concluding the memorials, when others have withdrawn, take one *liang* of cinnabar, grind it finely according to the day, and prepare a clean brush and an iron plate one *chi* two *cun* long and four *cun* wide. Follow the method of pacing the Dipper’s net to gather *qi*, then reverse the Dipper’s steps and stand facing the lunar station. Write in cinnabar without additions or omissions. Seal the completed talisman in yellow silk and stamp it with the *Dutian Fazu* seal, including the full official title and signature without revealing the name.\n\nWrite a separate directive, clench the *Tianding Mudra*, and recite the *Transformation Spirit Mantra*. Then summon the *Tianding* warriors: *\"For [location], long deprived of rain, I have submitted a memorial. Now I designate [specific lake or pond; if others, point as needed]. Rain must descend. I hereby dispatch you to accompany this talisman to [location] and urgently coordinate with the Rain-Dragon Department to deliver rain at [specific day and hour], without delay.\"* After inscribing the talisman, read it aloud, issue the command, and cast it into the water. Without fail, thunder and rain will promptly spread.\n\nNo errors are permitted in the dispatch. All documents must be stamped with the *Dutian Fazu* seal.\n\n---\n\n**Shangqing Great Power Dragon-Binding Talisman**\n**Dispersed Form**\n\n**Shangqing Great Power Dragon-Binding Talisman**\n**Dispersed Form**\n\nThe vast sky’s great cauldron seals the iron mountains of earth;\nThe primal root of these iron mountains submits to my stride.\nLeft, the *Tianding* warriors wield molten-gold fire bells to suppress and bind,\nStriking down the surging chaos as the *Taiyi Yuanjun*’s sun-clarifying fire and iron chains reinforce my power.\nLeft, the *Wuhe Jun* of *Yuyu Heaven*; the *Laojun* strides with the *Tianding*;\nRight, the *Qi Shi* rides forth.\n*Qian, Kan, Gen, Zhen, Xun, Li, Kun, Dui*—inscribe the character \"bind\" as you recite:\n*\"The Celestial Officials are my envoys,\nThe Terrestrial Officials are my envoys,\nThe Aquatic Officials are my envoys,\nThe Nine Rivers and Nine Jiang are my envoys.\nBy decree, I command the primal mark of the waterways:\n[Name of port or river], though a minor stream, must not defy heaven’s timing to harm living beings.\nThe Six Ding bind your hands; the Six Jia shackle your feet.\nIf you refuse this binding, the *Tianding* will sever your belly!\"*\n\n**Concentrated Form**\nFor this talisman, use cypress wood or an iron plaque, one foot and two inches in length. First perform the *Transformation of Spirit*, then summon the talisman’s *Guanjun* and the *Zhifu* of the Three Officials. Clearly state the matter at hand. Prepare cinnabar and a purified brush, stand at the Gate of Heaven, face the Dipper, and perform the *Step of the Net* twice in reverse. Enter the Dipper’s mouth, then begin writing the talisman while holding your breath. Once inscribed, deliver it to the *Tianding* warriors.\n\nClench the *Tianding Mudra* and state the matter:\n*\"For [specific task], I dispatch you to [location: river, lake, or pond].\nExecute [task: drive away or bind] as commanded.\"*\nAfter issuing the talisman, memorialize the *Zu Shi Shangqing Great Emperor* and the *Jade Sovereign of the Luminous Heaven*, affirming your actions. Submit a formal petition, clearly stating the details without error, and dispatch it to the officials of rivers and seas, as well as the *Nine Jiang Water Emperors*. Once the matter is fully explained, step the Dipper again, summon the *Tianding*, and have them carry the document to launch the talisman. Flick the mudra with your gaze.\n\nWhen casting the talisman, swiftly send someone to depart, lest the thunder’s roar or the sea’s waves startle the people.\n\n**Methods for Recognizing the Talisman’s Envoys**\n\n**Swift-Flight Talisman Envoy**\nCrowned, riding a dragon, wielding a sword in golden armor, clad in crimson robes.\nUsed to enter households afflicted by illness, drive away ghostly malevolence, and expel lingering corpses.\n\n**Subduing Malevolence Talisman Envoy**\nDisheveled hair, wielding a sword, clad in black armor.\nEmployed to enter water palaces and springs, dispel misfortune, and banish ghosts.\n\nIf affixed to a person’s *benming*, it will rouse their spirit at night.\n\n**Dragon-Shackling Talisman Envoy**\nThree-eyed, disheveled hair, silver armor, riding the *qi* of the Golden-Winged Scarlet Phoenix.\nUsed to shackle and sever water demons and monsters, subdue and restrain flood dragons and fish spirits.\nWherever this talisman is placed, water monsters dare not trespass.\n\n**Mountain-Shaking Talisman Envoy**\nFour-eyed, eight-armed, riding a fire dragon, borne on black clouds, accompanied by three thousand officers, generals, and soldiers.\nCapable of piercing the earth and shaking mountains; even the Five Peaks may be shattered by wind and rain.\nThis talisman must not be used recklessly.\n\n**Spirit-Seizing Talisman Envoy**\nDisheveled hair, clad in golden armor, eyes blazing with fire, wielding a demon-slaying sword, riding fire clouds, moving swift as thunder.\nUsed to seize ghosts, spirits, and the essences of stone and bronze mountains, shattering them without fail.\n\n**Yin Talisman Envoy**\nWrapped head, wielding a sword, clad in black embroidered robes.\nRiding the talisman’s *po* with accompanying soldiers, it severs and banishes ghosts and monsters, annihilating them completely.\n\n**Yang Talisman Envoy**\nWrapped head, wielding a sword, clad in purple embroidered robes.\nRiding the talisman’s *hun* with accompanying soldiers, it severs all terrifying specters and nightmares, dissolving them instantly.\n\nThese two talismanic scripts are the celestial decrees, the true pledges of heaven, the numinous texts of the Three Luminaries.\n\n**Dragon-Binding Talisman Envoy**\nThis talisman is the secret script of the *Taiyi Yuanjun*’s iron chains for shackling monsters.\nRefer to the instructions below; this talisman must not be recklessly transmitted.\n\n*Tai Shang Zhuguo Jiumin Zongzhen Miyao, Scroll Four Concludes*\n*Tai Shang Zhuguo Jiumin Zongzhen Miyao, Scroll Five*\n\n**Five Prisons Talismans**\nFrom the *Esoteric Writings of the Marrow of the Hidden Book of Supreme Clarity*, compiled by Master Dongyou of the Yuanmiao Tradition\n\nThe **Five Prisons Talismans** employ the *qi* of the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—to construct prisons, restraining and seizing evil spirits, malevolent ghosts, and wicked specters. Each talisman is inscribed and the prison established according to the dominant phase of the season, enabling interrogation, expulsion, and verification of responses.\n\n**Earth Prison Talisman**\nInscribe in cinnabar on yellow paper, first affixing it within the prison with a nail, then spreading ash.\nWhen creating the Earth Prison Talisman, first visualize the talisman envoy: his forehead smeared with crimson, head wrapped in a black cloth, clad in vermilion robes, wielding an iron rod, descending from the void. Next, envision the brush as a yellow dragon, its mouth emitting luminous *qi* to form the talisman.\nBefore setting brush to paper, recite the incantation seven times, then recite the name of the Earth Star seven times.\nUpon completing the talisman, recite the Earth Star’s name thrice and the \"Three Bindings\" seven times.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*Om □ ra bō sǒng nà yě yě dà tuó ā niè dì líng tí dì hǔ luō ěr yā tí ōm yī hǎi lóu hǎi shā shā pó hē.* Draw *qi*.\n\n**Earth Star’s Name:** *Junzhali.*\nThis is the secret name of the Earth Star.\n\n**Three Bindings.**\nRecite these two characters when completing the talisman.\n\n**Wood Prison Talisman**\nInscribe in cinnabar on blue-green paper, place within the prison, then spread ash.\nWhen creating the Wood Prison Talisman, visualize the Year Star arriving from the east, descending and transforming into blue-green *qi*, which pours into the crown of the head. Envision yourself wearing a star-crowned headdress, clad in blue-green robes and vermilion shoes, holding a blue-green jade tablet in the left hand while inscribing the talisman with the right. Imagine the brush as a blue-green dragon, its mouth emitting luminous *qi* to form the talisman.\nBefore setting brush to paper, recite the incantation seven times:\n- For the character \"太上治书,\" recite: *\"By the decree of the Most High Lord Lao,\"* draw *qi* and blow.\n- For the character \"七统,\" recite: *\"By the decree of the Seven Stars,\"* draw *qi* and blow.\n- For the character \"煞鬼,\" recite: *\"Heavenly Slayer, Earthly Slayer, Year Slayer, Month Slayer, Day Slayer, Hour Slayer.\"* Draw the *qi* of celestial rigidity and blow, each seven times.\n- For \"急召,\" recite: *\"Hasten!

By the blue-green numinous *qi* of the East, seize them!\"* Draw *qi* and blow.\n\n**Fire Prison Talisman**\nInscribe in ink on red paper, place within the prison, then spread ash.\nWhen creating the Fire Prison Talisman, first visualize the true *qi* of fire from the south arriving like a silk ribbon, entering the eyes and suffusing the body, igniting flames of radiant light. Next, envision yourself as a three-headed, four-armed figure. Then, imagine the brush as a fire dragon, its mouth emitting luminous *qi* to form the talisman.\nBefore setting brush to paper, recite the incantation seven times, then inscribe the talisman.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*Om dīng luó tán nǎng dá luó yě yě wěi bō zhà hōng pó hē.* Draw *qi*.\nUpon completing the talisman, recite: *\"By the cinnabar numinous *qi* of the South, seize them!\"* Seven times, draw *qi*.\n\n**Water Prison Talisman**\nInscribe in cinnabar on black paper, place within the prison, and proceed according to the method.\nWhen creating the Water Prison Talisman, first visualize the dark true *qi* of the north arriving like a silk ribbon, entering the ears and suffusing the body. The *qi* of mysterious light, misty and vast, suddenly transforms you into a Heavenly Soldier: left hand wielding a sword, right hand inscribing the talisman. Envision the brush as a black dragon, its mouth emitting luminous *qi* to form the talisman.\nBefore setting brush to paper, recite the incantation:\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"When the Morning Star appears, all ghosts hide in fear.\nThe Heavenly Thearch summons you—who dares conceal?\nAll malevolent specters, hasten to the prison and manifest!\"*\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\n\nUpon completing the talisman, recite: *\"By the mysterious numinous *qi* of the North, seize them!\"* Seven times, draw *qi*.\n\n**Metal Prison Talisman**\nInscribe in cinnabar on white silk, place within the prison, then proceed.\nWhen creating the Metal Prison Talisman, first visualize the *qi* of white light arriving from the west like a silk ribbon, entering the nose and suffusing the body, radiant as moonlight.

When raising such a prison, also inscribe this talisman, burn it, and have the afflicted person ingest it, adhering to the Five Phases’ numerical sequence: one for Water, two for Fire.\n\n**Method for Establishing the Five Prisons**\nWhen constructing the Five Prisons, submit memorials and documents in accordance with the *Celestial Heart* method and the *Celestial Prison* protocol, employing the same directional alignments as before.\nEach prison should be circular, thirty-six inches in diameter. Place the talisman at the prison’s center, then spread fine ash atop it to a depth of two *fen*.\nFor the **Water Prison**, use a new, unblemished basin of three *dou* capacity, free from leaks, filled seven-tenths with pure water. Place a bright mirror above it. Inscribe a talisman for mountain spirits and wild specters in cinnabar, positioning it behind the basin’s mouth at the center. Light a long-burning lamp and float it upon the water’s surface.\n\nThe oil exhausted, replenish it. Place a ritual sword horizontally atop the basin, using a bolt of black silk—black silk gauze will also suffice. Prepare one bundle of paper money for the Five Directions, and five paper horses, suspended in midair forty-nine inches above the basin’s surface.\n\nFor the **Wood, Metal, Earth, and Fire Prisons**, simply position the mirror upon the ash, place a lamp beside it, and suspend the mirror above. Set the sword upright beside the lamp, with colored silks matching the directional hues; the rest follows the same protocol.\n\n**Proclamation Format for Establishing the Five Prisons**\n**Notice from the Northern Dipper Bureau for Expelling Evil:**\nTo all marshaled divine generals, chief magistrates, and attending officers:\nThis bureau, on the [day] of [month] at [hour], has submitted a memorial to the Celestial Court and petitioned the Eastern Peak, filing a writ with the Metropolitan City God, requesting the dispatch of divine generals, magistrates, officers, and soldiers to apprehend the malevolent spirits, ghosts, and demonic thieves plaguing the household of [name], bringing them to this prison to manifest their traces and render clear retribution. All relevant divine officers are hereby notified and charged with this duty, to facilitate their subsequent transfer.\n\nThis notice is hereby issued to all marshaled divine generals, chief magistrates, officers, and soldiers for their information and compliance.\nIn the year of [Tai Sui], [month], [day], [hour]\nProclamation.\nSealed by the Ritual Master [half of the name withheld].\n\n**Diagram of the Prison Layout**\nAfter constructing the prison, burn the talisman for summoning ghosts (as per the *Celestial Prison* protocol).\n\n**Invocation upon Completing the Prison**\nOnce the prison is established, burn incense, transform into the divine form, and pace the Seven Stars of the Dipper, as previously instructed. State the purpose of the prison’s construction, execute the *Duhjian* mudra, silently summon the City God, and entreat the household’s Controller of Destiny, the Five Paths Earth Deities, and the neighboring altar and temple spirits. Clearly command the divine generals, officers, and soldiers to enforce the deadline, ensuring the malevolent ghosts are apprehended within the allotted time, brought to the prison to manifest their traces, and render clear retribution. This will facilitate their transfer; any negligence or disobedience will result in all relevant deities being reported to Mount Tai for investigation, with those complicit subjected to judgment. This decree is hereby issued for implementation.\n\nThe prison’s invocation is identical to the *Celestial Prison* incantation. The method for verifying ghostly traces within the prison follows the same protocol. If no retribution is observed after two days, resubmit the writ and urge compliance.\n\n**Talisman for Summoning Mountain Spirits and Wild Specters**\nInscribe this talisman in cinnabar. Execute the *Xuanwu* mudra, visualizing oneself as the True Warrior, hair unbound, wielding a fire bell of samādhi and a divine sword, treading upon the tortoise and serpent. Execute the *Tianding* mudra, summoning the Celestial Ding Warriors, the Four Duty Gods, and the divine generals, visualizing them at one’s side.\n\nFirst, execute the mudra, cast the Dipper, and with the Dipper’s handle pointing ahead, direct it toward the location of the spirits. Then approach the altar and recite the incantation:\n*\"I bear the seal of the Most High; hasten to this place. Deploy the divine qi, sever ghosts, and expel demons. Four Duty Messengers, Six Ding and Six Jia, I urgently summon you—speed to this altar. Here I stand, sword planted, awaiting you. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"*\n\nUpon completing the incantation, visualize the Six Jia, Six Ding, Four Duty Gods, talismanic envoys, and divine soldiers fanning out to search and drive the spirits beneath the altar.\n\nInscribe the talisman in cinnabar.\n*Disperse the forms.*\n\n**Gold, Fire, Earth, Water, Wood—**\n**Yin Dipper, the Twenty-Eight Constellations,**\n**Devour demons, consume ghosts, seize all perverse ways.**\n**Gather the forms.**\nThis talisman pursues and summons mountain spirits and wild specters.\nTo establish the Five Prisons, inscribe it as shown above.\n\n**Wind-Pursuit Method**\nWhen one encounters an ill wind on the road—an act of malevolent spirits—if it brings harm to people, execute the Dipper mudra, visualize oneself as a Heavenly Ding Warrior, and form the *Heavenly Steel Ghost-Slaying Seal*. Envision the Four Duty Gods driving and restraining the pernicious specters. Cast the Yin Dipper to ensnare them, then strike with the *Golden Blade Mudra Seal*. The wind will split in two. Cast the Yin Dipper again to cover it, and strike once more with the *Golden Blade Seal*—the wind will plummet or scatter downward, leaving traces of blood.\n\n**Rain-Summoning Method and Talisman**\nIn times of drought, first perform the Offering Rite on a *ren-gui, zi-chou* day. Pace fifty-six steps with the Dipper’s handle, wielding the sword, and visualize oneself as a Heavenly Ding Warrior clad in crimson robes and vermilion shoes. Facing the current celestial stem-branch, summon the *Gongcao* spirits, then cast this talisman into a nearby river or stream—the rain will arise of itself.\nInscribe this talisman in cinnabar on an iron plaque.\n\n**Memorial-Presentation Method**\nWhen employing talismans to treat illness or dispel violent afflictions, one must first purify body and mind, don solemn and immaculate robes, set up the altar, and present the memorial.\nBegin by swallowing the *Purification Talisman*:\nWhen inscribing the talisman, calm the mind, face the *wang* direction, hold the breath, and tap the teeth three times. With cinnabar, draw two talismanic scripts. After completing one talisman, burn it and cast it into the bathing water to cleanse the body. Then dissolve cinnabar in a vessel of pure water, swallow it, and wash the five viscera, purging both inner and outer perverse *qi*.\n\nNext, execute the *Three Terraces Mudra* and recite the incantation. Inscribe the *Master Builder Talisman*, following the mudra while intoning the names of the Three Terraces: *Xujing, Liuchun, Qusheng*. Then recite the incantation:\n*\"Heaven and Earth in motion, essence of sun and moon,\nRadiance piercing the Four Seas, slaying perverse spirits.\nSevering demons, dispelling illness, the body shines with light.\nThe divine water now made, ten thousand calamities vanish in form.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"*\n\nUpon completing the incantation, take up the brush and inscribe the talisman.\n**Two *Master Builder Talismans* for Yin and Yang Days**\nInscribe in cinnabar on *gang* days.\n\nOn *rou* days, inscribe with ink.\n\n**For the Two Talismans:**\nOn *yang* days, inscribe the *yang*-day talisman with cinnabar.\nOn *yin* days, inscribe the *yin*-day talisman with ink.\nFor each inscription, prepare two talismans of the corresponding day: burn one to ash, mix with pure water, and swallow; place the other on the altar for the memorial petition.\nWhen inscribing, ensure no unauthorized persons witness the process.\n\n**Method for Prostrating the Memorial Petition**\nWhen presenting a memorial to Heaven, the ritual master dons the proper vestments and steps within the *Dipper’s Net* upon the altar, positioning himself at the *Dipper’s Mouth* with the memorial case before him.\nFirst, visualize himself as the Envoy of the Demon-Quelling Court, prostrating in profound stillness. He envisions two youths wielding swords and holding seals, with the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior stationed before, behind, left, and right. The radiance of the sun and moon illumines his eyes, the Five Stars crown his head, and the *qi* of blue, yellow, and white swirls about his body. A nine-colored halo emanates from behind his neck, penetrating both within and without, until he beholds the Supreme Lord Tang of the Upper Primordial standing before him, holding a talisman. To his left, Lord Ge of the Middle Primordial stands with a halberd; to his right, Lord Zhou of the Lower Primordial holds a staff. At the center, the Directing Attendant and Merit Clerk, with messengers to left and right, and Golden Lads and Jade Maidens attend. The officials, divine generals, and spirit marshals of the memorial’s retinue, the deities and officers of the register and ritual, and the Vajra-Powered Warriors array themselves in encircling ranks.\n\nNext, he visualizes himself ascending in a cinnabar-jade chariot, borne upon crimson clouds from the northwest. First, he enters the realm of the *Gang* Wind, where sun and moon intertwine in brilliance, the Yellow Path stretches smooth and straight, and he passes through five-colored clouds to reach the Heavenly Gate. Traversing the Desire Realm and the Formless Realm, he crosses the Heaven of the Seed People, where seven-jeweled jade groves line the path, their branches stirred by numinous winds to produce celestial harmonies. Beyond the Yellow Path, a purple cloud forms a canopy, and in the distance, the gates of the Golden Palace appear, inscribed with *Taiqing* and *Taiji*. One hundred paces from the gates, he dismounts, leaving his guardian officers and generals behind. Only the Jade Maiden of the Decade and the Jade Lad bearing the memorial, carrying the memorial case, accompany him as he hastens forward into the palace gates.\n\nHe enters the second enclosure of the Golden Palace, inscribed *Gate of the Three Heavens of the Supreme Lord*, but does not proceed through this gate. Instead, he turns west and descends to the *Taiyuan* Capital Gate. North of the gate lies the Heavenly Pivot Court, where he beholds the Great Hall. There, he pays homage to Celestial Master Zhang of the Orthodox Unity and prostrates to present the cause of his memorial. The Celestial Master approves, then exits the hall’s eastern gate, turns north, and proceeds to the Phoenix Tower. After a brief interval, a Jade Lad in vermilion robes and black cap emerges from the gate, takes the memorial case from the hands of the memorial-bearing Jade Lad, and enters to present it before the Supreme Lord.\n\nNext, a Leading Immortal Attendant guides the audience. The Supreme Lord wears a crown of Nine Virtues and a robe of nine-colored cloud and mist, seated upon the central dais. Two Perfected Ones stand in attendance to his left and right, with hosts of immortals in escort. The Grand Unity, clad in vermilion, stands before the Supreme Lord to review the memorial’s text, then privately conveys its intent. The Supreme Lord commands the Grand Unity to inscribe the response beneath the Jade Stairs of the *Taiqing* Palace. Upon the right steps of the Jade Hall, the memorial is entrusted to the duty officers of the day, and the ritual concludes with obeisance.\n\nThe Supreme Lord then dismisses the Celestial Master, who rejoins the officials and officers at the gate, exulting as they return to the chariot. Retracing the path of their initial procession, they arrive before the altar. The master announces the completion, rises, and bows twice.\n\n*Tai Shang’s Secret Essentials for Assisting the State and Rescuing the People, Volume Five* concludes.\n*Tai Shang’s Secret Essentials for Assisting the State and Rescuing the People, Volume Six* begins.\n\n**Master of the Cavernous Mysteries Yuan Miaozong’s Compilation**\n*Ritual Forms and Jade Regulations of the Hidden Writ’s Marrow and Numinous Texts on Ghostly Statutes, Volume Three*\n**Comprising Ten Sections, Totaling One Hundred Fifteen Articles**\n\n**Daoist Methods Section: Twenty-Seven Articles**\n\nAll ritual officers of the various practices shall conduct yang actions with yin reciprocation, their merits and demerits assessed annually in accordance with these forms.

After bestowal, their masters shall instruct them in strict discipline. Secret incantations and sacred texts of the ritual tradition shall be transmitted orally and memorized; omission is forbidden. Violators shall be investigated by the Three Officials.\n\nRitual officers who skillfully transmit orthodox teachings to Daoist practitioners, aiding and saving the people with efficacious results, may annually submit memorials for consideration and exceptional rewards.\n\nThose who recommend unworthy candidates or fail to recommend worthy ones shall be sentenced to one year of penal servitude.

If the circumstances are particularly harmful, the master shall report the facts in full; first, the offender’s life shall be forfeit, and afterward, their nine clans shall be punished.\n\nFor Daoist practitioners who report the transmission of orthodox teachings to save the people, if their master obstructs them out of greed for wealth, they shall receive one hundred strokes of the rod.

The same punishment applies if no payment is received. Those who falsely present other methods as orthodox teachings shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.\n\nThose who show orthodox demon statutes to unworthy persons, or who lend or entrust them to others for transcription, thereby treating them with disrespect, or who debate them with unqualified practitioners and reveal their secrets, shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.

Those who deliberately cause others to use the teachings to entrap ghosts and spirits shall be sentenced to two years; if death results, they shall be exiled three thousand *li*.

The institute’s divine generals and officers shall be dispatched to report the matter and carry out the appropriate punishments according to severity. Those who submit memorials when they should not, or fail to submit when they should, shall receive one hundred strokes of the rod.\n\nWhen transmitting orthodox celestial writings, secret records, talismans, and registers to others, copies may be made, but the originals shall be stored in stone caskets within famous mountains, great rivers, grottoes, or cliffs. After ritual officers receive new edicts, talismans, or promotions, all previously bestowed documents shall be burned and cast into rivers or lakes; only the documents of their current office may be retained. If the documents are not burned, they shall be wrapped in old ritual robes and cast into rivers. Used talismans, brushes, ink, cinnabar, paper, inkstones, water, Daoist crowns, ritual robes, and all other replaced items shall be burned and cast into water, or buried in grottoes or stone chambers, with their secrets preserved by incantations; violators shall be sentenced to one year of penal servitude.\n\nFor the transmission of orthodox teachings, on the days of *jiazi*, *gengshen*, the Three Origins, the Eight Festivals, the Five Lax Days, or one’s own life-day, the recipient shall kneel to receive the sword, seal, incantations, brushes, ink, cinnabar, and ritual implements, all of which shall be consecrated and offered. Pledges, contracts, and instruments of trust, such as gold and silver, shall be melted down and sold, the proceeds used for offerings and to aid the poor; they shall not be appropriated for personal use, or the offender shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.\n\nFor ritual officers who pass away suddenly, if they have foretold their departure with extraordinary signs, this is a mandate from heaven, and they shall depart abruptly. If no such signs appear, the authorities shall investigate, and if the circumstances are unclear, the heir to their teachings or their kin shall promptly burn the talismans, edicts, ordination certificates, and ritual robes of their master, as well as the documents and robes of their own rank, casting the ashes into the Yangtze River for the Water Officials to convey to the underworld; violators shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude.\n\nFor ritual officers whose merit and conduct are complete and who are summoned by heaven, their bodies shall move twice upward and thrice downward, like the motion of serpents or insects, accompanied by a sound like the wind. Their eyes shall lack divine radiance, the Celestial Pillar shall not rise, the Heavenly Drum shall not sound, and their Kidney Hall shall ache. Their spirit and *qi* shall surge from the Bubbling Spring point to the Crown Gate. They shall then gather their edicts, registers, talismans, seals, and containers in one place, don fresh ritual robes, sit upright, and leave final instructions to their heirs. Before their transformation, auspicious clouds and immortal retinues shall arrive to escort them directly to their grotto-heaven, where they shall receive immortal office and assume their duties. If their body shows signs of failing but they are unable to sustain themselves, the local earth deity shall assist their heirs in sealing the documents as described above; violators shall be exiled three thousand *li*. For grave offenses, the punishment shall be death.\n\n**Articles 35–39:**\nAll orthodox demon statutes, talismans, and registers shall be stored in fragrant boxes, embroidered bags, or bamboo containers. When inspecting them, one shall enter stillness with eyes closed, establish a ritual boundary, and only then open the scrolls, reading no more than five lines at a time. They shall be kept secret and never allowed to be stolen or seen by ghosts and spirits.\n\nFor virtuous commoners who truly drive away evil and assist the upright, demonstrating merit in aiding others, their names shall be recorded and submitted, and they shall be transmitted orthodox teachings, appointed to office, and granted rank.\n\nAll ritual implements of the institute—such as swords, seals, brushes, ink, cinnabar, inkstones, crowns, shoes, and ritual water—shall not be privately used without prior submission and consecration.\n\nFor disciples seeking transmission, they shall approach their master with measured steps.\n\nThe master ascends the altar to expound the precepts, performs the rites of blood-oath and cinnabar-drinking, divides the ring and breaks the contract, swearing solemn vows. Next, he imparts the esoteric hand seals and talismanic texts, declares the true instructions, and kneeling, the disciple receives the official rank, seals, swords, and the like. The master petitions the Perfected Ones above, expelling the Three Worms from the four limbs, absolving the myriad sins of the Nine Mysteries, and reports the disciple’s conduct to the appropriate authorities, aligning with the celestial will.\n\nAll divine generals, officers, and soldiers—those dispatched by the Eastern Peak—shall, upon arriving at the institute, be received with wine, food, spirit money, and paper horses as offerings. They shall remain steadfast in their duties, prepared for summoning and use, and must not be privately employed.\n\nWhen ritual officers pass by places with spirit shrines, they shall form the *Tian Ding* hand seal, sound the celestial drum, and summon the divine officials and guardian generals within their bodies to accompany them, thus displaying their majesty, so that spirits naturally submit in awe.\n\nRitual officers shall don their robes at dawn, harnessing the vital *qi* for their work. When submitting memorials or conducting jiao rites, they must not burn sandalwood or frankincense.\n\nAll human lifespans are ordained by Heaven, with destiny and longevity fixed. If, after the institute’s efforts to save them, the afflicted still do not recover, it is because their allotted span has ended and their karmic cycle is complete; in such cases, no further talismanic texts may be employed, for it would be in vain.\n\nWhen aiding the world’s people, the documents dispatched must not be overly elaborate; only sincere and direct matters may be stated. Moreover, one must explicitly declare that the person’s life is under celestial jurisdiction, that their fate and lifespan are being contested, and that the petition does not fall within the scope of the current appeal, thus seeking a clear response.\n\nWhen receiving complaints about maddened demons or malevolent spirits, the ritual officer transforms into a divine form, accepts the petition, seals it, and dispatches the spirits accordingly.\n\nFor jiao rites, memorials to the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor may be submitted, but these must not be offered frivolously at improper times. When burning memorials, they shall first be consecrated with a pledge token and sent by the dispatched *Gong Cao* and *Zhi Fu* spirits.\n\nWhen conducting jiao rites before the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor, a single *Cai Fang* emissary may be positioned beside them; no other deities may approach the imperial seat.\n\nWhen entering stillness to burn incense, perform rituals, or transcribe texts from the esoteric tradition, one must first cover the Dipper, and must not allow one’s gaze to wander.\n\nFor those who have been wronged unto death and return to cry for vengeance, they shall be suppressed with the Dipper’s cover.\n\nWhen treating cattle, horses, and other livestock afflicted by pestilence, inquire after the number of losses and submit a document to the Year-Star deity to drive away the plague.\n\nWhen accepting offerings of faith, assess the sincerity of the giver; the monetary value shall be divided into three parts: one for use, one for offerings, and one for alms to the poor, thus sustaining the Dao.\n\nWhen establishing a prison to treat illnesses or dispatching talismanic texts, those who resist shall be seized and tried as prisoners.\n\nFor those possessed or tormented by nightmares, with depleted heart and kidney *qi*, talismans shall be swallowed or worn to suppress the affliction.\n\nWhen treating children suffering from night terrors or nocturnal crying, entrust the case to the Household Deity, the Eaves Spirit, the Four Heavenly Kings, the Flying Celestials, and the Swift Spirits, using the Three Lights talisman for healing.\n\nRitual officers who daily save the world’s people shall use the funds for sustaining the Dao, accepting no bribes from the people. Heaven will naturally bestow blessings; if resources are lacking, memorials may be submitted, for sincerity will be met with unseen aid, and no want shall remain. If one accepts bribes, worldly support will not endure.\n\nFor households whose hearths or businesses are afflicted by malevolent hexes, employ the Three Lights talisman to dispatch spirits for treatment.\n\nWhen undertaking construction or repairs, submit a document to the Year-Star deity to pacify the local Earth God and other spirits, preventing them from causing harm.\n\nFor strange anomalies residing in ponds, embankments, or dikes that cause frequent damage or untimely destruction, entrust the local Earth God to drive them away, and suppress them with the Three Lights talisman. Those who refuse to leave shall be punished and expelled according to the law.\n\nWhen epidemics spread and people suffer from illness, in addition to submitting documents to the local Earth God, a petition shall be sent to the Year-Star deity to withdraw the toxic *qi*. If a memorial must be flown to Heaven, the institute’s officer shall perform the *Yu Bu* step, transform into a divine form, and silently recite the oral memorial to make it known.\n\nFor childless commoners, whether due to barrenness or poverty, first use ritual methods to repel the Three Punishments and Six Harms stars, then have them wear the register.\n\nFor those whose dwellings are inauspicious, with disharmony between yin and yang, mutual clashes, and years of hardship, bestow upon them the Orthodox Register.\n\nWhen performing rituals, gauge the severity of the matter and act accordingly; do not recklessly mobilize divine generals, officers, or soldiers. When receiving and sealing petitions, dispatch them promptly, and do not implicate the spirits in wrongdoing.\n\nWhen transmitting orthodox teachings, conduct a jiao rite on an auspicious day within the esoteric tradition, called the Transmission Jiao. Offer 120 portions of spirit money and paper horses as ceremonial gifts. For the Middle Sage’s position, the offerings shall be half the number. The memorialist shall comply, reporting to Heaven and Earth. After the officiating officer submits a letter of guarantee, the esoteric hand seals, talismans, official decrees, and true registers shall be conferred, and a report shall be sent to the Eastern Peak to transfer the name from the underworld’s ledgers to the celestial records. Thus, the nine generations shall be pardoned, liberated from the dark realms, and ascend to the realm of the living. The sequence of rites upon the altar shall follow the prescribed method.\n\nWhen ritual officers of the Demon-Quelling Institute perform their duties, they shall be titled *Du Da*, overseeing all demonic matters across the Three Realms. The initial appointment is as Right Vice Magistrate, followed by Right Magistrate, then Left Vice Magistrate, then Left Magistrate—all of whom jointly administer the institute’s affairs. Those with exceptional merit shall ascend to the immortal ranks and be appointed as *Du Tian Da Fa Zhu*, jointly administering the institute’s affairs. Next, they may be promoted to *Jiu Tian Jin Que Da Fu* for saving twenty people within a year, or for swiftly answering prayers during famines, droughts, or floods. Further ranks include Minister of the Water Department, Minister of the Wood Department, Minister of the Earth Department, Minister of the Metal Department, and Minister of the Fire Department—each awarded based on the number of people saved annually, exceeding twenty. Those who perform exceptionally in averting great disasters shall be promoted accordingly. Finally, they may be appointed as *Zi Wei Gong Shi Ri Zhi Yuan Jun*.\n\nThose who, by year’s end, assist the state in averting disasters and secure the peace of the realm, dispatching ghostly soldiers to secretly aid the imperial throne in achieving great tranquility, shall be promoted. Further, those who within a year drive away or eradicate locust plagues and monstrous calamities from the designated celestial regions, employing ritual methods to remove them, shall be elevated to *Jiu Tian Jin Que Yu Shi*. In the following year, should they vow to establish altars upon renowned mountains, submit petitions, and present memorials to pray for the sovereign’s longevity—with verifiable efficacy—they shall be advanced to *Jin Que Shang Xian Shi Zhong*. In another year, if they attain self-realization of their nature and essence, transcending the mundane, and guide the deluded masses to escape the Five Sufferings, personally journeying to the Southern Bureau to register their merits—ensuring sagely rulers, virtuous ministers, the salvation of their nine clans, and the benefaction of all beings—they shall be promoted to *Zi Fu Shang Xiang*, followed by *Xuan Du Da Xiang*, *Tai Xuan Shang Xiang*, *Tai Ji Shang Xiang*, and *Jin Que Shang Xiang*. In yet another year, if they fully comprehend the boundless Dao, free from attachment to written words, and through direct instruction achieve tangible results—such as quelling the harm caused by dragons in rivers, lakes, and seas, or averting landslides and floods—demonstrating true merit in benefiting the state and relieving the people while eradicating great malevolence, they shall be elevated to *Wu Ji Shang Xiang*.\n\nFrom *Ri Zhi Yuan Jun* to *Wu Ji Shang Xiang*, encompassing nine ranks of promotion, one shall be conferred the *Shang Qing Jiu Deng Da Lu* before being permitted to enter this system of advancement. Other positions follow the hierarchy of the immortal officials, with the Three Primes as the foremost. For those of the *Dong Shen* rank and below, progression begins with the *Chu Xia Yuan Yi Pin Xian Guan*. Next is the *Zhi Bei Ji Qu Xie Yuan Shi Zhong Yuan Yi Pin Xian Guan*, who oversees the Northern Pole Exorcism Institute. Following is the *Shang Yuan Yi Pin Xian Guan*, who governs the Fengdu Bureau. Those who fulfill their merit and karmic fruition shall ascend in sequence, attaining the Golden Gates and standing in attendance beside the Three Pure Ones.\n\nAll officials tasked with issuing the talismans of the Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor, the Northern Dipper, and the Three Luminaries shall transform their spirits and submit memorials, stating their requests and declaring themselves as subjects. In accordance with the prescribed formula, the petition shall be dispatched with the prayer: \"May it be as this subject has declared.\" Upon concluding the invocation, the talisman-bearing messenger shall be immediately dispatched, and upon its arrival, the decree shall be executed.\n\nAll ritual officers, when entering or exiting, shall constantly visualize the Six Ding, the Four Straight-Land Deities, and the Guardian Warriors following them. They shall command these spirits by ritual, ensuring no mishaps occur. When ritual officers ascend to the presence of the Supreme Emperor, exorcise pestilential spirits, or sever demonic influences, they must first don the Northern Dipper’s Three Terraces and transform into the Exorcism Institute’s Envoys. When paying homage to the Supreme Emperor, they shall ascend the Golden Hall on the first day of the new year, the Lapis Lazuli Hall in spring, the Precious Pearl Hall in summer, the Silver Hall in autumn, and the Crystal Hall in winter.\n\nAfter completing their memorials to the Supreme Emperor, they shall proceed to the Celestial Pivot Institute to command the Four Heavenly Kings, the Twelve Great Deities, the Eight Vajras, the Six Ding and Six Jia, the Marshals Tian Peng and Tian You, the Fire Bell Generals, the Five Thunder and Wind-Rain Gods, and exit through the Celestial Gate. When establishing prisons, they must memorialize and report to Mount Tai, detailing the circumstances and stating: \"On such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month, a celestial prison was established in such-and-such a direction.\" They shall memorialize the Supreme Emperor, designating it as the Five Dipper Prison.\n\n**Eight Regulations**\n\nAll celestial talismans and registers shall be inscribed with the brush of the Six Jia and Six Ding, using the ink of the Black Emperor, the cinnabar of the Solar Numinosity, and the inkstone of the Five Dragons, strictly adhering to the transmission and empowerment methods before use. When subduing fierce ghosts and spirits, it is essential to deploy the divine generals with meticulous care, employing the left and right exorcism incantations of the Dipper’s canopy. The practitioner shall then proclaim: \"I record your transgressions and pardon you, for my heart is set on saving the people.\"\n\nWhen conducting rites to beseech blessings and avert disasters for the people, one shall first memorialize the Star Host True Lords, then sit and declare: \"Disciple [Name] performs this rite to avert calamity, accumulate blessings, prolong life, and dispel misfortune, ensuring prosperity and longevity. With utmost sincerity, I prepare these offerings, humbly beseeching your divine perception and response to my devotion.\"\n\nWhen reciting the *Shang Qing* Dipper-Stepping Incantation, upon reaching the \"Celestial Rigidity\" step, one shall flick the seal mudra and then point with the Celestial Rigidity Seal. If reciting incantations within talismans, one shall step the Dipper beginning with the Star of Greed and Wolf.\n\nWhen offering sacrifices to the gods, one shall do so on the seasonal days of the Six Jia and other designated dates. In spring, the Six Jia days; in summer, the Six Bing days; in autumn, the Six Geng days; and in winter, the Six Gui days. Outside the gates, one shall present three portions of vegetarian fruits, dates, and fragrant tea to honor the Three Realms. The Straight Talisman and Four Straight Merit Officers shall first transform the spirit money for the local earth god, then state: \"By the decree of the Jade Emperor, I assist in the transformation of heaven, aid the state, and save the people. In all talismanic rituals to sever demonic influences, cure illnesses, rescue the perilous, bestow blessings, and invoke auspiciousness, I rely on you, the messengers, to communicate with the myriad sagely hosts above and below. Today, I have prepared wine, fruits, spirit money, and horses as offerings for this rite. I humbly beseech your benevolence, manifest your majestic radiance, and bestow your divine protection.\"\n\nNext, one shall pour three libations of wine, burn the spirit money, and recite the incantation.\n\n**Oath to the Merit Officers**\n\n\"I have heard that those who cultivate the great Dao in former lives now become supreme spirits, with merit and conduct as their foremost priority and the salvation of the people as their urgent task. Thus, they manifest in the unseen and respond in the netherworld, emerging from water and entering fire, assuming myriad forms with boundless efficacy. Clad in armor, bearing drums and bells, they traverse freely without obstruction. At their presence, evil demons tremble in fear, and the afflicted find peace. I wield the orthodox Dharma to subdue demons, relying on your divine might to assist in capturing and subduing malevolent spirits, severing the roots of calamity, bestowing blessings upon the virtuous, and ensuring merit returns to the path of goodness. Today, with this sacrificial offering, I modestly repay your divine merit, slightly expressing gratitude for your toils, and reciprocating your numinous power. I deeply appreciate your strenuous efforts and humbly invite you all to feast to your fill.\"\n\n**Oath to the Divine Generals**\n\n\"You shall all feast to your fill on wine and food, then compose yourselves with solemn dignity, uphold the celestial precepts, reverently execute the Emperor’s commands, wield the authority of martial prowess, and achieve the merit of pacification. With your illustrious achievements, may your resounding response be clear. I now invoke the divine generals and soldiers dispatched by the Eastern Peak, who possess hidden martial prowess, innate strategic acumen, awe-inspiring reputations, and majestic virtue. Hear my call!\"\n\n\"Responding to the Eastern Peak’s command to pacify the realm, you wield the exclusive authority of punitive expeditions, striking terror—where malevolent spirits vanish in an instant, the winds and clouds shift hue, and wherever your divine halberd points, no great evil dares stand before you. You aid the state and succor the people, benefiting the times and sustaining all beings. With wholehearted devotion to the Dao, none surpass your merit. Having early received the immortal’s decree and long been sheltered by the Dao’s grace, I have presumptuously assumed the authority of a celestial officer, relying solely on the protection of the supreme deities. Above, I guard my person and preserve my life, cultivating the Dao and serving Heaven, drawing upon my innate truth to aspire to celestial rank. In the middle, I propagate the sagely transformation and manifest hidden merits, extending this numinous power to fulfill my aspirations. Below, I rescue people and benefit beings, curing illnesses and expelling evil, exterminating malevolent spirits and fostering prosperity, striving to accumulate good effects and resonant responses, making subtle virtues manifest. You shall share in these benefits; when merit is achieved, you shall together enjoy its glory. Together, we shall advance the conveniences of this world and collectively uphold the supremacy of the true Dharma. Benefit without harm, awe with just punishment. For all matters that deviate from the mean or violate harmony, harm beings or defy Heaven, execute punitive measures and carry out executions, eradicating evil and aiding the upright, thereby completing merit and overcoming malevolent power, triumphing through divine transformation over treacherous schemes. How could I, a mere mortal, withstand such trials? Who could resist? Only with your divine assistance can I uphold the great Dao. *Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\nTo all divine generals, officers, and soldiers: by this Dharma decree, I entrust and charge you to constantly guard and uphold the true Dharma, as proclaimed in this notice to the Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute.\n\nThe divine generals, officers, and soldiers currently under the jurisdiction of the Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute have been dispatched by the Jade Emperor’s edict to this institute to protect the Dharma, propagate transformation, assist the state, succor the people, and guide all beings toward the true Dao. It is feared that you may not be aware: this institute possesses the Heavenly Seal, measuring either one inch and eight fen, two inches and one fen, three inches, or five inches square. It commands hundreds of thousands of billions of celestial soldiers. Every stroke and line of the seal’s script conceals thirty-six myriad beings. The seal’s soldiers and generals turn at my command; evil demons hear of it and their gall shatters, the sick see it and find peace. Bestowed by the Supreme Emperor, borne by mighty warriors, the seal’s soldiers—hundreds of thousands of billions—come and go like the wind, formless and traceless, infinitely transformative, hidden within the seal. Summoned, they arrive; some appear as colossal figures filling the void, heads bearing Mount Sumeru, shoulders supporting the sun and moon, hands grasping the Emperor’s bell, feet treading *kui* dragons. Others manifest as minute forms entering a speck of dust, revealing vast numinous power within a hair’s breadth, upholding the true Dharma, endlessly transforming to rescue sentient beings, never boasting of their merit. Their wondrous power and the Dao’s methods are boundless.\n\nIt is feared that the divine generals, officers, and soldiers under your command may, in ignorance of these decrees, willfully disobey and incur punishment. Do not slight this institute. Now, the celestial soldiers and generals, as well as the Eastern Peak’s soldiers and generals, are to be divided into rotating shifts, prepared for urgent summons. Upon hearing this institute’s call, you must hasten to arrive. If not on duty or unsummoned, you are to remain concealed within the Six Directions, hidden and lying low.\n\n**Detailed Roster:**\n\n1. Celestial soldiers, generals, and officers must always be prepared for summons. If unsummoned, they may not leave the celestial realm without authorization.\n   - Southern Dipper celestial soldiers: 3,600\n   - Black *Sha* divine soldiers: 50,000\n   - Soldiers and generals of the Four Wheels, Orthodox First Division\n   - Soldiers and generals of the Radiant Light Division\n   - Celestial *Ding* deities\n   - Mighty warriors\n   - *Vajra* deities\n   - Radiant deities\n   - Flying Dragon cavalry officers: 1,000\n   - Dragon-Slaying cavalry officers: 1,000\n   - Dragon-Severing cavalry officers: 1,000\n   - Generals assisting the Dharma: 2\n\n2. Soldiers and generals dispatched by Mount Tai are to be divided into two shifts, alternating daily. They shall accompany the institute’s ritual officers in their comings and goings; in urgent matters, this does not apply. They may only station at this institute and must not act with negligence. The generals assisting the Dharma are to be constantly supervised.\n   - Commanding general: 1\n   - General assisting the Dharma: 1\n   - Infantry and cavalry: unspecified number\n   - Personnel arriving from the Eastern Peak Pass\n\nThe above-listed soldiers, generals, and divine officers are hereby notified. You are to carefully follow the preceding directives and comply accordingly. Any violation will not be lightly forgiven. For those who render merit, rewards and commendations shall be given, with petitions submitted to the celestial realm to bestow blessings. This is no empty declaration; let all take heed.\n\n*Dated: [Year] [Month] [Day]*\n*Sealed by [Dharma Title]*\n\n*End of Scroll Six of the* Supreme Pervasive Essentials for Assisting the State and Rescuing the People\n*Scroll Seven of the* Supreme Pervasive Essentials for Assisting the State and Rescuing the People\n*Compiled by Master Dongyou of the Mysterious Dao, Yuan Miaozong*\n*Preface to the Methods for Aiding the Upright and Exorcising Evil through Summoning*\n\nThe Methods of Aiding the Upright and Exorcising Evil through Summoning originate from the Orthodox Unity Dao, hence there are registers for the Three and Five Summoning Methods. The officers, generals, clerks, and soldiers are all recorded in the original texts. According to the *Golden Lock Flowing Pearls*, those who practice the summoning arts must receive the root scriptures and registers from an enlightened master. These include the Generals of the Three Origins and Five Phases, the Six Jia and Seven Stars, and the Jade Maidens’ scriptures and diagrams.\n\nSummoning, in essence, involves the examination of ghosts and the calling of spirits. One must resolve to assist the state and pacify the realm, healing and delivering the common people. Those who receive the true methods of summoning are akin to celestial officials, comparable to the governors of great commanderies. Their sacred duties are not to be taken lightly: every hundred days, they must perform a thought-patrol, inspecting the world for malevolent spirits, ghosts, and demonic influences, ensuring they do not cause harm. Every ten days, they must engage in thought-application, visualizing the world to guard against wicked essences, demonic spirits, dragons, and ghostly entities that might bring calamity, as well as the toxic qi and turbid chaos that disrupt humanity. They must also prevent untimely winds and rains.\n\nBeyond these duties, they must tend to their own being, ensuring their hun and po souls remain upright, their true qi constantly flowing, and their spirit luminous and vigorous—thus attaining longevity. It is further said that those who perform summoning thought-patrols traverse the ten directions of the world, delivering beings with impartiality. Whether serving the state, governing the household, or aiding individuals, their meritorious deeds resonate between Heaven and Earth, and their virtuous deeds are heard in the Jade Capital above. When their merit is complete, the Celestial Emperor dispatches immortal envoys to welcome them, elevating them to the rank of Great Immortal Perfected. Since the time of the Human Sovereign and extending to the era of Luan Ba, those who attained the Dao and practiced these methods were too numerous to record.\n\nYet, in this age, scholars lack true masters, and the original essence of the practice is lost. Unable to uphold the grand principles of the authentic and true, they cling to minor, fragmented techniques, often misapplying them under false names. Such superficial and incomplete practices are hardly worthy of the Dao. If one does not trace the roots and distinguish the branches, the profound mysteries of the original mechanism will remain obscured. Trivial details and peripheral knowledge, when mistaken for the core discipline, prevent scholars from delving into the profound and mastering the ultimate truths.\n\nThus, I have meticulously compiled the essential principles of the ancient summoning methods, placing them at the forefront, while supplementary techniques are arranged thereafter. This is to distinguish their origins and clarify their hierarchy, illuminating the fundamental and the peripheral.\n\n**The Six Meritorious Virtues of Summoning**\nThe Later Sage Lord addressed the Celestial Master, saying: \"These summoning methods, when applied by people, yield six kinds of merit and virtue.\n\nFirst, they can heal illnesses caused by malevolent influences, capture, execute, and eradicate demonic afflictions.\n\nSecond, they can assess the celestial and earthly bureaus to determine the lifespan, wealth, and destiny of individuals.\n\nThird, they can restrain and sever public and private grievances that cause harm.\n\nFourth, they can resolve life-threatening conflicts between husbands and wives, parents and children, ensuring harmony and averting disasters of metal, wood, water, and fire, allowing all to proceed without obstruction.\n\nFifth, they can dissolve public and private curses, vengeful ghosts, and harmful spirits, whether from the living or the dead, as well as schemes and slander, ensuring mutual safety.\n\nSixth, they can eliminate natural disasters—untimely winds and rains, imbalanced four qi, venomous dragons, ferocious spirits, excessive floods and droughts, and pestilential qi. Only those who practice the true celestial methods can eradicate these.\"\n\nThe Celestial Master was further told: \"These six methods were established by the Supreme Great Dao Lord, who wove the true qi of Heaven and Earth into talismans. Comprising one thousand three hundred eighty-one ranks, they constitute the Great Summoning Method. This is the most sublime and wondrous of the Dao’s methods for delivering people and aiding beings. Those who practice it must do so without deceit or reckless application.\n\nWhen a Perfected One completes three thousand merits through this method, they ascend in broad daylight, their entire household—including chickens and dogs—rising to Heaven together.\"\n\n**Establishing the Altar and Visualizing the Master’s Instructions**\nAccording to the *Orthodox Unity Summoning Ritual*: \"The summoning method involves examining ghosts and calling spirits. One must set up an altar, establish the register, construct a prison, and open its gates. A rope is used to encircle the altar and prison, with four gates opened. Prohibited steps and boundary formations are then established. A fragrant offering table and bright lamps are prepared, and during the middle of the night, the Yu step is performed at the center, circling outward in a T-shape to seal the boundary and consecrate the water. Facing west, one visualizes the Three Origins Summoning Orthodox Unity Master, the Venerable Li, and the Grand Preceptor of the Register, the Venerable Li Huiju. At times, their names may be softly invoked. They appear in fluttering purple robes, adorned with crowns and swords, riding nine-colored lions. Purple clouds descend from the northwest, encircling the altar three times. One visualizes bowing three times in reverence, then declares: 'I hereby consecrate this altar.'\n\nThe master then commands the yang soldiers to join the celestial and human realms, uniting with the register soldiers within one’s body to act in concert for a specific household—whether to expel malevolent ghosts or address a particular matter. The master further commands the yin soldiers to assist the register soldiers within one’s body, entering hells, waters, or tombs to capture harmful spirits. The malevolent ghosts and thieves of the household are brought to the altar, interrogated, and their cases reported.\"\n\n**Oral Petition Formula**\n\"I, your subordinate [Name], humbly follow the celestial statutes to perform this method. May the yang and yin masters—if the yang master is absent, visualize the original master in their stead—assist me. I form the Celestial Master’s mudra, invoking the descent of true qi into my body. Aid me in deploying soldiers and spreading qi, releasing water and igniting fire. Dispatch the Three Origins Great Generals, lions, and fierce beasts to unite with me in heart and strength, crushing the mountain, temple, or lair of the malevolent bandits, demons, or evil ghosts. Let their strongholds be shattered, burned, or washed away. Capture the demonic spirits, execute them by waist severance, and cure the illnesses, ensuring the matter is resolved. Additional details may be appended as needed.\"\n\n**Summoning and Interrogation Mudra for Officials and Soldiers**\n\nFor all summoning and interrogation rites, first visualize the master before you, radiating great luminosity. From this light, soldiers emerge in countless numbers, led by the Three Origins and Three Generals, along with the Five Virtue Generals and their armies of hundreds of thousands. Alternatively, visualize the Six Jia and Twelve Divine Generals, the mighty Heavenly Soldiers, arrayed in formation around the person’s dwelling, while also stationing them to guard and defend your own gates. At each gate, deploy sixteen soldiers—eight on each side—wielding blades and spears, as in a military encampment. Once the strict commands are issued, then visualize the master and yourself leading the troops to patrol the aforementioned gates above and below. Only then seal the boundary, recite the prohibitions, and proceed with talismans and documents to summon and apprehend.\n\n**Visualization Mudra for Healing Illness**\n\nWhen visualizing the master to heal illness, from the radiant light, soldiers surge forth to encircle the seas, block the earth, traverse the heavens, and scour the prisons. Together with [the patient], they extract the three *hun* and seven *po* (or fourteen *po* for women), freeing them from the demonic realm and restoring them to the original body, so that the illness is instantly cured.\n\n**Mudras of the Three Masters**\n- The mudra of the *Third Master* is on the first joint of the left hand’s fifth finger.\n- The mudra of the *Original Master* is on the third joint of the second finger.\n- The mudra of the *Celestial Master* is on the second joint.\n\n**Visualization for Summoning and Interrogation**\n\nFor all summoning and interrogation, visualize the master dispatching soldiers precisely as prescribed. Then imagine the Twenty-Eight Constellations arrayed above you. Next, the Three Generals and their officials and soldiers, along with the Three Origins, are fully prepared—the Three Origins’ soldiers and generals are complete. Then form the mudra of the Three Generals, located on the first joint of the left thumb’s center.\n\nOnce done, sit beside the altar, recite the text according to the ritual, summon the spirits and gods, interrogate the malevolent entity’s name, and issue a judgment for its capture and confinement. If the spirit is stubbornly evil, later submit a *Red Memorial* to request heavenly troops to execute the demonic entity. Thus, the illness will swiftly be cured, and the matter promptly resolved. Then express gratitude and repay the favor, offering thanks to the venerated master.\n\n**Summoning, Visualization, Incantation, and Protective Mudra for Healing**\n\nFor the summoning ritual master, always enter a quiet chamber at dawn, wear the talismans, clasp the mudras, pace the Dipper’s steps, and exhale *qi* to form a purple cloud, first covering your own body so that ghosts and spirits cannot harm you in return. Next, when treating illness, visualize the cloud covering the patient’s dwelling on all sides, as well as the afflicted person’s body. Surround them with the Five Directions’ military formations, encircling their body and home, ensuring swift efficacy. Then form the *Capital Supervisor’s* mudra, visualize the Northern Dipper’s seven stars above the head, the Three Terraces covering the back, and the [missing character] star pointing in the appropriate direction.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"The Supreme transmits the teachings,\nThe later sages propagate their flow.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Master personally transmits this,\nWith ninety million soldiers in array.\nPatrolling the ten directions,\nDeploying *qi* across the Three Clarities.\nNo evil factions among the spirits,\nNo demonic essences among the ghosts.\nHumans and ghosts each dwell in their place,\nNo strife permitted between them.\nThose who bring calamity shall die,\nThose who bring blessings shall live.\nI know fortune and misfortune,\nDiscerning them clearly with a gesture.\nPoint left to extinguish three,\nPoint right to topple four.\nDo not violate my Dao,\nFor my Dao is most serene.\nThose with guilt shall not be pardoned,\nThose without guilt shall find peace.\nHeaven bestows this method upon me,\nCommanding me to enforce its decree.\nDo not defy my might,\nFor my might is the Seven Stars’ ferocity.\nI drink your blood,\nI consume your essence.\nAll shall be level and smooth,\nMy Dao does not punish.\nAll poisons and harms,\nMy Dao commands to take effect.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees!\n\nThe incantation complete, again close the *qi* and pace the Yu Steps. The left hand holds the *Dao Father*—*Father* being yang. Men hold it with the left hand. Suddenly, it rises from the hand, like a human head wearing a lotus crown, clad in purple robes, gradually ascending from the hand to the front of the heart, matching one’s own height. Then visualize the body as nine feet tall, with the Four Symbols’ soldiers and generals arrayed clearly on all sides. The right hand forms the *Ghost Eye* and *Spirit Eye* mudras, marking them with cinnabar. The left and right hands face each other before the heart. Either visualize oneself as the *Examination and Summoning* Ritual Master or as the *Examination and Summoning* Envoy. Then click the teeth thirty-six times and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Heaven shines bright,\nEarth spirits stir.\nI am the master of Examination and Summoning,\nExisting before heaven and earth’s beginning.\nI patrol as heaven and earth’s envoy,\nI stand as heaven and earth’s soldier.\nCalamity and evil meet their end,\nFortune and virtue arise of themselves.\nNot only do I restrain tigers and wolves,\nI also command the Five Weapons.\nDivine dragons dare not act divinely,\nEvil ghosts dare not act demonically.\nPoint at mountains, and they crumble,\nPoint at waters, and they dry up.\nPoint at stones, and they roll away,\nPoint at sun and moon, and they shine.\nWherever I walk or sit,\nA hundred thousand soldiers guard me.\nWhere my hand points,\nWind, fire, lightning, and radiance arise.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees!\"*\n\n**True Names of the Three Yuan Generals:**\nUpper Yuan General Tang, personal name Hong.\nMiddle Yuan General Ge, personal name Yong.\nLower Yuan General Zhou, personal name Wu.\n\n**True Names of the Five Virtue Generals:**\nEast: Green Dragon General, personal name Mengzhang.\nWest: White Tiger General, personal name Jianbing.\nSouth: Vermilion Bird General, personal name Lingguang.\nNorth: Dark Warrior General, personal name Zhiming.\nCenter: Curved Array General, personal name Huangting.\n\nWhenever performing the Examination and Summoning method to save and heal living beings, purify body and mind, uphold the precepts, and accumulate virtuous deeds. Receive and wear the talismans as previously described.\n\nWhen treating illnesses, have the afflicted household provide a detailed account, stating the cause of the disease, the reason for the malevolent influence, and even the patient’s age—each detail must be recounted in full. Then proceed with the ritual method to examine, treat, and heal. If the matter is of considerable gravity, construct an altar and recite the Divine Incantation of the Northern Emperor of the Purified Heaven and Earth thirty-seven times. Dispel impurity, expel miasma, and command the spirits. Invoke the Celestial Perfected, presenting the circumstances with reverence. Success hinges on sincerity, and merit is thereby accomplished.\n\nShould ghosts, malevolent spirits, demons, or spectral apparitions be present, first employ the Northern Emperor’s Universal Heaven-Covering Method to restrain and enclose the spirits, preventing their escape. Next, establish the altar and arrange the ritual implements. Then, clasp the mudra, knock the teeth, and summon the divine generals and spirit soldiers to drive and seize the spirits. Next, use incantations to reveal the forms of the malevolent entities. Then, apply talismanic methods to expel and disperse the pernicious *qi*. Next, dispatch spirit officials to investigate the root cause of the affliction. If wicked or rebellious ghosts remain unsubdued, immediately establish a prison to confine them. Then, following the Celestial Heart method, submit memorials and petitions. Next, perform the Dipper-Raising Rite to shield and conceal the afflicted household. Finally, admonish the household deities to encamp and protect.\n\n**Northern Emperor’s Universal Heaven-Covering Method:**\nThe method is numinous, moving heaven and earth, shifting stars and constellations, unlocking celestial gates, turning the earth’s axis, driving mountains and peaks, and covering spirits. My method is no ordinary method—it is the Orthodox Dao of the Three Clarities, reaching upward to the Eight Extremities and descending into the Nine Springs. To the east, it connects with Fusang; to the west, it extends to Yanni.\n\nTo the south, it reaches the Sea Gate; to the north, it extends to Fengdu. The Great Mystery’s killing qi disrupts heaven and throws earth into chaos. Ghosts above cannot descend; ghosts below cannot ascend. Above, I unfurl the Celestial Net; below, I spread the Earthly Web. Heavenly ghosts are forbidden from descending to the mortal realm; earthly ghosts are forbidden from revealing their forms. Patrolling the four worlds, all wicked ghosts lie within my covering. I reverently summon the Three-Five Generals, the Five Lakes Generals, the Three Origins Generals, the Huoluo Generals, the officers and soldiers under the Three Masters, the officers and soldiers within the Northern Dipper’s *Kui*, the river officials’ officers and soldiers, the thunder and lightning officers and soldiers, the Southern Dipper’s Ghost-Slaying Envoys, the Northern Dipper’s Blazing Furnace Envoys, the Celestial Couriers’ armored troops, and the ten-thousand-zhang-high striking might of the awe-inspiring sword. The great drum’s mighty warriors, five-eyed and three-eyed, the six-armed Celestial *Ding*, with bronze fangs and iron claws, lightning eyes and six pupils, nine heads and eight horns, crimson hair and indigo bodies, clad in golden spears and silver armor, fill the empty void. Azure Dragon and White Tiger, Vermilion Bird and Victorious Serpent, fierce and colossal beasts, flying owls and hooked ropes. Heavenly Peng and Huoluo, the mighty Flying Heavenly Demon Kings, the Five Directions’ Vajras, the Five Directions’ Warriors, the Five Directions’ officers and soldiers, the Five Directions’ *yakṣas*, the Five Dippers’ encampments, and the clouds converging from the eight directions. The Five Lakes and Seven Marshes, the Five Peaks and Seven Temples, the twenty-four *zhi*’s pits, hollows, caves, and grottoes—all array their ranks, deploying troops step by step. The mountains, forests, and trees are searched meticulously. What spirit does not submit beneath my covering? What ghost does not lie within my net? Those who comply with me will prosper; those who defy me will perish. The merciful shall live; the malevolent shall die. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the law of the Great Yin and the Northern Emperor’s decree!\n\nWhen practicing this method, first visualize the fire of the heart blazing around the body, refining form and spirit. Then imagine oneself as the Summoning Envoy, with awe-inspiring divine majesty, roaring like thunder. Stand facing south, form the Celestial Net and Earthly Web mudra with both hands, and exhale qi like a thunderclap. Immediately recite the preceding incantation, then inhale qi and blow it into the mudra, casting it toward the place where the ritual is performed. Pray thus:\n*Qi transforms into iron; the net is like black clouds. Dark mist envelops heaven and earth, covering the direction of the wicked ghosts.*\n\nFor the Celestial Net and Earthly Web mudra: with the left hand, join the third, fourth, and fifth fingers; with the right hand, join the third, fourth, and fifth fingers. The right thumb presses into the left thumbnail’s base, while the left and right index fingers extend. After reciting the incantation, interlock the index fingers and cast the mudra toward the afflicted household. Then proceed with all ritual methods and prohibitions.\n\n**Method for Revealing Ghosts’ Forms:**\nFirst, have the afflicted person stand at the threshold, eyes closed for a moment. Then, the ritual master takes a mirror in the right hand and, with the left eye, visualizes inscribing a talisman within it. Once done, place the mirror on the table, form the Lion Seal with both hands, and press it over the talisman on the mirror’s surface. The ritual master then holds the mirror before their heart, aligning it properly. Recite the incantation:\n*Heavenly spirits and earthly deities, all numinous beings converge. By the decree of the United Brightness Celestial Emperor, I reverently summon the swift envoys from the eight directions to pursue and capture the malevolent ghost, forcing it to reveal its form.*\n\nThen call the names of the spirits:\n*Om, judge the malevolent! Om, judge the malevolent! Judge and seize! Judge and seize! Take and judge! Take and judge! Śrī! Śrī! Hūrū! Hūrū!*\n*Seize the ghost! Seize the ghost! Seize swiftly! Seize swiftly! Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the law!*\n\nReverently summon the local Day-Patrolling Envoy to pursue and capture the ghost. Reverently summon the local Earth God to pursue and capture the ghost. Reverently summon the local Five Paths Envoy to pursue and capture the ghost.\n\nAfter reciting, face north and shine the mirror once, then recite the incantation again, shining it a second time. Repeat this three times. Once the incantation is complete, have the afflicted person blow qi into the mirror and open their eyes to see within it: whether the affliction is a ghost, spirit, or demon; a deceased family member; or an external ghost—all will be clearly revealed.\n\n**Visualize the talisman and incantation within the mirror:**\n*Celestial August, Earthly August, Human August, Celestial-Human August, Earthly-Human August, Human-Human August. Om, Emperor Sovereign, summon the local Earth God and warrior to capture!*\n*Heaven is yang; earth is yin—ghosts and spirits have nowhere to hide.

Hold the bright mirror in the right hand, press the first joint of the left index finger with the left hand, and visualize the mirror emitting a five-colored radiance, illuminating every direction without exception. Proceed step by step to summon and capture the malevolent ghosts and spirits, allowing none to escape, all appearing before the ritual mirror.\n\n**Water Reflection Method:**\n*Water Official slays ghosts; Earth Official slays ghosts; Heaven Official slays ghosts. Encounter water, water subdues; encounter earth, earth subdues; encounter heaven, heaven subdues. All waters cease flowing; slay the lawless ghosts and send them beneath the Southern Mountain’s foothills to receive death. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the law!*\n\nFor this method, write the characters for \"mountain\" and \"water\" in the air with the right middle finger, then recite the preceding incantation, transforming the words into a spell. With the right hand, scoop from the air into a basin of pure water. Have the afflicted person blow qi into the water. Recite the incantation:\n*By the duty officer, the Day Clerk Envoy, and the Twelve Hour Spirits, swiftly summon the local Earth God and the domain’s proper deities to pursue and capture the malevolent ghost afflicting this person, forcing it to reveal its form swiftly!*\n\nSummon and command.\n\nUpon reciting the incantation, have the afflicted person blow qi into the water once more. Whatever ghost or specter appears must be clearly and truthfully described, with no concealment allowed. I enact the Great Highest’s method, duty-bound to subdue ghosts and save the afflicted. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the law!\n\n**Method for Revealing Ghosts in Darkness**\nReverently invoke the celestial perfected, the celestial cavern’s Six Jia Yang spirits, the Six Jia Yin spirits, the Four Duty Envoys, and the Soul-Driving Envoys. Urgently compel the vengeful ghost’s qi to manifest its form. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the law, summon and command.\n\nFirst, have the afflicted person lower their head and close their eyes. Recite the preceding incantation once and blow onto the crown of their head. Then guide qi to a dark place, blowing three breaths into it. Have the afflicted person gaze into the darkness to identify the possessing spirit. If the spirit attempts to enter the afflicted’s body, recite the incantation again, omitting the phrase \"manifest in darkness\" and instead saying, \"Urgently drive the vengeful ghost to swiftly enter the patient, borrowing their mouth to communicate.\" The possessing spirit will immediately enter the body and speak.\n\n**Method for Binding Ghosts**\nReverently invoke the Upper Clarity’s Three Heavenly Valiants and the Eight Slayer Generals. Urgently assist me in binding the malevolent ghost to prevent its escape. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the law.\n\nFor this method, face north and center the mind. With the left hand, press the second finger onto the *yin* position of the *dou* diagram. Recite the incantation, inhale qi three times, and blow onto the afflicted’s body—the ghost will be bound of its own accord.\n\n**Method for the Twelve Spirit Generals to Capture, Shackle, and Interrogate Ghosts**\nReverently invoke the Divine Generals Dengming, Hekui, Congkui, Chuansong, Xiaoji, Shengxian, Taiyi, Tiangang, Taichong, Gongcao, Daji, and Houshen.\n\nFor this method, transform into the Celestial One, the Noble Spirit, donning the Northern Dipper’s three-tiered crown. Stand facing west, feet aligned with the *ding* trigram. With the left hand, begin at the *hai* position, encircle to *zi* to form the mudra. Summon the spirit generals, commanding: \"Urgently pursue and capture the ghost afflicting this person’s body, whether it be a temple spirit, earth god, kitchen deity, household spirit, violently deceased specter, malevolent wraith, or demonic entity—any that have harmed the patient. Gather them all without exception and attach them to the afflicted’s body to receive my true method. Interrogate them to reveal their origins, names, and deeds. Whether distant in the six directions and eight wilds or near at hand within the household, they must be pursued and brought forth without fail.\" Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the law.\n\nThis method is performed on a *liu jia* day at the *hai* hour. Hold a ritual offering beneath the stars, using a bolt of blue cloth sewn into a square purification cloth. Place it atop a clean mat, with offerings of seasonal flowers, pure fruits, jujube broth, clear wine, and thirteen sets of lamps and incense. Present the written petition and make the offering. From the *hai* hour through the *xu* hour—one full day and night—read the petition aloud, praying and expressing the intent to commune with spirits to heal the afflicted. Around the ritual space, sprinkle water boiled with *mao* incense for purification, ensuring no outsiders or animals disturb it. After the ritual, consume the offerings yourself; discard the remainder in flowing water, sharing with no one. In cases of urgent illness or peril, pray to the Noble One and summon the generals—they will respond immediately. Each spirit general commands troops to relieve suffering. Sincerity and adherence to the method are paramount; never attempt this lightly.\n\n**Method for the Mighty Celestial Ding to Pursue and Capture Malevolent Ghosts**\nFirst establish an altar. Choose a day when the Perfected Warrior descends for the ritual offering. Lay out a clean mat, spread purified yellow earth half an inch thick, and level it. Unfurl the mat atop the earth, placing four incense burners at the center. Arrange seasonal fruits, dried venison, and clear wine in four portions at the cardinal directions, then light the lamps and burn incense. The officiant, dressed in proper attire, approaches the altar, plants a sword upon it, and faces north to bow to the Most High Lord Lao, the Northern Culmen Great Emperor, the Four Sage Perfected Lords, and all spirit generals and troops. Next, visualize the Northern Emperor above the officiant’s head, suspended in the void, clad in a dark dragon robe, wearing a level-heaven crown, black shoes, and a sword, his solemn countenance vividly painted, guarded by the Four Sages. Then summon the four Mighty Celestial Ding spirit generals, each leading troops, to descend from heaven to the altar and partake of the offerings. Read the petition aloud, offering detailed prayers, presenting incense and wine three times without bowing. After the ritual, gather the spirit tablets and enshrine them in the spirit generals’ hall. For subsequent summonings, follow the procedures below, observing the proper decorum.\n\n**Eastern Mighty Celestial Ding Pursuing Ghost General Wen Yu**\nClad in a green robe with wide sleeves, wearing a green headscarf, his face red, he wields twin blades.\n\n**Southern Mighty Celestial Ding Capturing Ghost General Li Gongda**\nDraped in a red-patterned wide-sleeved robe, wearing a red headscarf, his face reddish-yellow, he brandishes an iron staff.\n\n**Western Mighty Celestial Ding Binding Ghost General Wu Tian’an**\nDressed in golden armor, wearing a plain headscarf, his face yellow-white, he holds an iron chain.\n\n**Northern Mighty Celestial Ding Interrogating Ghost General Liu Wuzhen**\nClad in a black wide-sleeved robe, wearing a black headscarf, his face dark and ashen, he wields a halberd.\n\nAfter invoking and offering to each according to their direction, if malevolent spirits or ghosts employ sorcery, summon the generals to pursue, capture, and interrogate them—they will respond with immediate efficacy.\n\n**Northern Dipper Qi-Directing Method for Curing All Illnesses**\nTo treat illness, the officiant faces north with the patient before them. The officiant visualizes the Star Lord Tanlang, ten *zhang* tall, clad in plain silk robes, hair unbound, exhaling blue qi. Upon completing the visualization, inquire about the cause of the illness, then inhale the patient’s qi. Next, recite *Om* to Tanlang, draw in his blue qi, and blow it onto the patient’s afflicted area. With the right hand, gather the qi and recite the incantation:\n\n\"Subtly profound, profoundly obscure,\nFirst Celestial Stem, Second Celestial Stem, Third Celestial Stem, Fourth Celestial Stem—\nborn of Heaven and Earth.\nSpirits fail to return to nurture, ghosts fail to return to life.\nSwiftly respond to my mouth, swiftly respond to my voice.\nHasten as the law commands!\"\n\nUpon completing the recitation, form the mudra again to gather the qi, and the illness will be cured immediately.\n\n**Method of the Northern Thearch for Splitting Ghostly Fetuses, Ghostly Masses, and Malevolent Qi**\n\nFirst face north and visualize oneself as the Six Ding spirits. Hold an iron axe in the right hand while the left hand forms the Six Ding mudra at the second joint of the third finger—do not move carelessly, for movement will render it inefficacious.\n\nNext, visualize the earth as the Black Prison of Fengdu and burn incense to the left and right.\n\nThen, bend the left leg and kneel on the right, placing a purified axe before the face.\n\nNext, have the patient stand or sit facing south before the officiant. With the right hand, trace the character \"田\" (field) on the ground.\n\n**Pattern of the \"田\" Character**\nOpen the Gate of Heaven,\nClose the Door of Earth,\nLeave the Gate of Man,\nBlock the Path of Ghosts,\nPierce the Heart of Ghosts,\nRupture the Belly of Ghosts.\n\nThen recite the incantation again while tracing the \"田\" character:\n\n\"Reverently invoke the Great Black Deity of Heaven,\nwith sixfold penetration, swiftly sever and seize!\"\n\nOnce the incantation is complete and the character formed, have the patient cough once, drawing in qi and blowing it onto the center of the \"田\" character. Immediately grasp the purified axe in the right hand and split it along the qi—whereupon the ghostly fetus, ghostly mass, and malevolent qi will dissipate at once.\n\n**Talisman of the Three Officials for Searching Out Malevolence**\n\"Dispersed Form\"\n\n**Upper Prime: Heavenly Official of Bestowed Blessings**\n**Middle Prime: Earthly Official of Pardoned Transgressions**\n**Lower Prime: Water Official of Released Calamities**\nLeft: Azure Dragon\nRight: White Tiger\nAbove: Vermilion Bird\nBelow: Dark Warrior\nGenerals of the Three and Five—\nin hand they grasp the coiling serpent, ten thousand *zhang* in length,\nfrom whose mouth fire spews ten thousand *li*, burning and slaying all wayless and malevolent ghosts.\n\n**Concentrated Form**\nThis talisman, when worn upon the body, serves as the *kao-zhao* method for the ritual master.

Drawing in *qi*, he blows it onto the paper, then instructs the afflicted to twist two paper legs—one left, one right—and dip them in oil. Recite the incantation once more and blow upon the paper legs. Have a family member light a lamp and support the afflicted in the room to illuminate them. The ritual master conceals the Iron Rod Seal within his sleeve.

Command the divine generals to drive the Earth God into the afflicted’s body for a clear response. The Earth God shall report the details. Once verified, order the divine generals to escort the Earth God back to his post, where he shall constantly patrol and protect, and drive the malevolent spirit forth for further interrogation.

Secure them with a needle, burn them in a paper lantern to ash, and mix with ritual water.\n\nIf the afflicted is severely ill, unconscious, with clenched jaw and rigid limbs, yet the heat in the heart has not ceased, swiftly pour the talisman water into the ears.

Urgently summon the Flying Hun-Soul Messenger to swiftly arrive and transfer the hun-soul.\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!\n\nThis method is used when the afflicted is emaciated and weak, unable to endure the driving and interrogation. Summon another person to stand facing the patient. First, have the afflicted blow qi, then have the standing person inhale it. Both close their eyes. The ritual master faces north, recites the incantation three times, draws qi, and blows it upon the afflicted’s head. Recite the incantation once more, draw the afflicted’s qi, and blow it upon the substitute’s body, commanding: \"Swiftly enter the body!\"\n\n**Another Method**\nReverently invoke the Heavenly Deities of the Black Path to come to my body, as I act by the Northern Emperor’s decree.\n\nThis method is used when a child is afflicted and unable to speak. The ritual master first has the mother hold the child, stand facing him, and inhale the child’s qi once with eyes closed. The ritual master forms the Golden Spear mudra with both hands, faces north, recites the incantation three times, draws three mouthfuls of qi, and blows them toward the child’s face. Command the divine generals to swiftly drive the spirit into the body. The child’s spirit, once transferred, will differ from its usual state.\n\n**Erasing the Blockage Method**\nReverently invoke the Great Sage of Six Penetrations, the Mighty Heavenly Ding, assist me in attaining numinous communion, and together search for and seize the malevolent qi. Let it enter the brush without movement.\n\nBy the Emperor’s decree!\n\nFirst, inquire about the size of the patient’s blockage, then have them firmly grasp it with their hand. Place a sheet of thick paper on the table. With the left hand, form the Golden Spear mudra, and with the right hand, hold the brush. Visualize the brush as a golden spear and the paper as the blockage. Facing the Heavenly Gate, recite the incantation three times, inhale qi, and blow it into the brush. Next, with the left hand, press the *mao* trigram, and on the paper, write a single \"field\" character (田). Recite:\n\nOpen the Heavenly Gate,\nSeal the Earthly Door.\nPreserve the Human Portal,\nBlock the Demon Path.\nPierce the demon’s heart;\nRend the demon’s belly.\n\nUse this incantation to write the \"field\" character. Have the patient cough once, then with the sound, inhale qi and blow it onto the *mao* trigram. Press firmly, and with the brush, erase the \"field\" character, starting from the Heavenly Gate and moving toward the southeast. Ask how much the blockage has diminished, then take black ink and erase it again. Each stroke must be accompanied by reciting the incantation and inhaling qi to erase it.\n\n**Method for Treating Childhood Fright and Convulsions**\nSever the waist, sever the hands,\nSplit the belly, gouge the heart—\nThe Six Ding wield the blade.\n\nThe ritual master takes a brush dipped in ink, recites the incantation once, draws the Heavenly Rigid Qi, and blows it into the brush.

Recite the first line of the incantation and write the character \"moon\" (月) on the child’s palm. Recite the second line and write the character \"blade\" (刀). Then draw the Solar Qi and exhale it onto the crown of the head. If the eyes begin to droop, immediately wash away the characters.\n\n**Character Placement in the Hand:**\nFor boys, first write on the left hand; for girls, first write on the right hand.\n\n**Method for Treating Childhood Milk-Retention**\nBy decree! I summon the Earth Spirit of the Central Palace, the obedient *mie* soul, to sever and seize.\n\nFirst inquire about the size of the retention, then take a thick piece of paper. Have someone firmly grasp the retention mass, ensuring the child cries out once. Inhale qi, recite the incantation three times, and blow onto the paper and brush. According to the size of the retention, draw its shape on the paper. With the left hand, form the Golden Blade mudra, recite the incantation once, inhale qi, and blow onto the paper, then swiftly tear it into two or three pieces. Recite the incantation again, inhale qi, and tear it into finer shreds—immediate efficacy.\n\n**Method for Treating Blown Retention**\nLeft Green Dragon, swiftly vanish.\nRight White Tiger, swiftly vanish.\n\nHave the patient face west and stand before the ritual master, regardless of distance. If the retention is on the left, instruct the patient to grasp it firmly, cough three times, and with each cough, inhale qi, recite the incantation, and blow onto the ritual master’s hand. The master then locates the left retention and performs the seizure thrice. If the retention is on the right, repeat seven times.\n\n**Nine Heavens Mysterious Maiden’s Flying Needle Method**\nDivine needle, numinous and bright,\nAligns with the Great Clarity above.\nThe three paths’ bitter afflictions,\nDisease appears, startling the self.\nThe needle meets the Heavenly Bureau,\nThe Heavenly Bureau takes heed.\nAgain, it meets the Earthly Prison,\nThe Earthly Prison must hear.\nBy decree of the Most High Lord Lao,\nThe needle shall not strike again,\nThe disease shall not recur.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances.\n\nFor this method, first select a fire-day to gather the first straight branch from the southeast side of a peach tree, one foot and two inches in length. Immediately face north, recite the incantation seven times, draw the Heavenly Rigid Qi, blow upon it, and store it in a red silk pouch. When treating a patient, have them stand facing the ritual master at a distance of about ten feet. Ask where the pain is, and instruct them to grasp the spot firmly. The ritual master then forms the Golden Spear mudra with the left hand, holds the needle in the right, and presses it against the *mao* trigram. The left hand rests on the waist, the right hand at the chest. Recite the incantation seven times, draw the Heavenly Rigid Qi, and blow onto the needle. Instruct the patient to cough once, inhale qi, recite the incantation once, and blow onto the *mao* trigram on the right hand. Rotate the needle three turns to the left, seven turns to the right, recite the incantation, and visualize the needle entering the afflicted area.\n\n**Four Saints’ Qi-Dispersing Method**\nReverently invoke Heavenly Peng, Heavenly You, Black Killer, and True Martial—restrain the martial, sever and kill: *hūm*.\n\nFirst, have the patient stand facing southwest. The ritual master then burns incense and transforms into the Envoy of the Demon-Quelling Court. With both hands forming the *zi* trigram, step backward along the Seven Stars’ Net. For a male patient, use the left foot to tread the net and point at him. For a female patient, use the right foot to tread the *ding* trigram and point at her. The ritual master steadies their body, closes their eyes, and silently recites the incantation once, visualizing the Four Saints descending from the sky. Swiftly inhale qi and blow toward the patient, instructing them to inhale the qi through their nose and swallow it, then exhale the pathogenic qi from their mouth. The breathing must not be audible to the ritual master’s own ears. After the treatment, have four people present money and horses in four portions, seal the petition, and detail the circumstances of the treatment and the patient’s condition—expressing gratitude must not be omitted.\n\n**Record of Breaking Malevolent Spirits**\n[Text missing]\n\nThe sacred talismans and the divine decree of True Warrior are invoked. We respectfully summon the Heavenly General Guangming, Ghost King of the Vast Net. Record the patient’s native place, birth year, month, day, and hour. The ritual master states their partial title.\n\nReveal the register and issue the command: Marshal Zhao Gongming, coercively summon the demonic form. Step *lin-lin*, step *lin-lin*, *lin* step *lin*, *lin* step *lin*—command and seize. Record the patient’s birth year, month, day, and hour. The ritual master states their partial title.\n\nFor these two registers, first have the patient’s family prepare a detailed petition before inscribing them. When writing, first burn incense and present the petition’s contents in prayer. Then, using the Mudra of the Five Peaks and Three Paths, inscribe the talismans. Draw *qi* from the Ghost Gate, combine it with the mudra, and blow it into the *Breaking Malevolent Spirits* register. Have the family take it home and burn one thousand strings of paper money. Reveal the register and place it by the patient’s head, beneath their bedding. After a short while, the malevolent spirit will manifest its form and shadow, or enter the body and declare its name.\n\n**Mudra of the Five Prisons and Three Paths**\nWith the left hand, press the *mao* trigram and say: *\"Grind the needle.\"*\nNext, shake the upper joint of the middle finger and say: *\"Vajra.\"*\nThen, press the middle joint of the four fingers and say: *\"Red apricot.\"*\nPress the *mao* trigram near the palm and say: *\"Ink-black.\"*\nNext, press the middle joint of the middle finger and say: *\"Numinous Treasure.\"*\nPress the *mao* trigram and say: *\"All merits accomplished, the horn is subdued and the corner is suppressed.\"*\nPress the *chen* trigram and say: *\"Rise and live, alone and bound, gather the souls of Han, gather the souls of the public.\"*\nDraw *qi* and flick it into the talisman.\n\n**Methods for Invoking Divine Generals in Sacrificial Offerings**\nThis is a separate technique among miscellaneous methods, often used with great efficacy. It is appended here.\n\nFor all divine generals invoked in sacrificial rites, on the third, seventh, or thirtieth day, or on *jiazi* or *gengshen* nights, prepare money, horses, wine, fruit, incense, and lamps. Offer one steamed bun, a black silk banner, two bamboo knives, three staffs, two *qian* of cinnabar, and half a cup of pure vinegar, arranging them in a purified chamber. After the attendants have settled, present the invocation and prayers. Thrice offer incense and wine. At the third watch, burn all the money, horses, banners, and staffs. The ritual master consumes the steamed bun, cinnabar, and vinegar. Then, at the place of offering, calm the mind, close the eyes, and sit upright—or lie down if necessary. After a short while, a figure wearing a hat, robe, and sash will appear and converse with the ritual master. If anything is forgotten, perform the summoning and subduing method, and memory will naturally return.\n\nWhen offering money and horses, prepare a petition for each, inscribe the spirit tablets, and present them:\n*Seizing General Cui Shuxuan.*\n*Binding General Lu Jiquan.*\n*Shackling General Dou Yang, Beating General Yang Guang.*\n*Yellow-Headed General Chen Zhen.*\n*Disheveled General Liu Zhong.*\n*Prison-Head General Yang Zheng.*\n*Five Directions’ Pursuing Ghost General Zhao Gongming.*\n*Left and Right Urgent Seizing Generals Yao Duan.*\n*Fire Wheel General Song Wuji.*\n*Torturing Ghost General Deng Xingwen.*\n*Beheading and Draining Blood General Liu Yan.*\n*Yaksha General Chen Shouzhong.*\n*Divine Officer Wu Lang Ma Sheng.*\n\n**Method for Suppressing Scorpion Stings**\nIf a scorpion’s venom stings a person, swiftly press the second joint of the left hand’s second finger, recite the incantation, and blow on the painful area to suppress it—the pain will cease immediately.\nIncantation:\n*\"Eight Mights spew poison—hasten as the law commands!\"*\n\n**Alternative Method (Mudra as Above)**\nHeavenly Scorpion, beseech the water to extinguish the poison. By day, face the sun; by night, face the Dipper’s net. Draw a breath of *qi*, blow it onto the talisman, then inhale a breath from the talisman and swallow it—the pain will cease immediately.\n\nRecite the above incantation, write the talisman, and affix it—the cure will be immediate.\n\n*Tai Shang’s Secret Essentials for Assisting the State and Saving the People, Volume Seven—Concluded*\n*Tai Shang’s Secret Essentials for Assisting the State and Saving the People, Volume Eight*\n\nMaster Yuanmiao Zong of the Cavernous Mystery, Compiler of *Tai Shang’s Orthodox Methods: Diagrams and Texts of Yu’s Steps, Dipper-Net Hand Seals, and Gaze Techniques*\n\nThe methods of Yu’s steps, Dipper-net hand seals, and gaze techniques constitute the great essentials of the Dao and the primordial discipline of its methods. The step-net rides upon the upright *qi* to govern beings; the seal-gaze operates through the divine mechanism to enact transformation. Whether cultivating immortality and refining the true, or summoning, commanding, and subduing, none can do without these.\n\nThough earlier versions of the method texts recorded their outlines, omissions in practical application were not few. Here, I have compiled what has been transmitted to make them complete. May this modest effort encompass the vast, so that the marvels of the method families may be fully realized in their application.\n\n**Method of Yu’s Steps and Dipper-Net Seals**\n\nYu’s steps emulate the images of creation and the movements of the sun and moon’s measured cycles. One month has three conjunctions; each conjunction spans three decades. These three decades are the three full numbers. One season has three conjunctions; these three conjunctions make nine decades. Thus, one step is one conjunction; one conjunction has three traces. Three steps yield nine traces, symbolizing one season. Bringing the feet together represents the celestial conjunction.\n\nRaising the left foot first is the step of spring and autumn; raising the right foot first is the step of winter and summer. The first months of spring and autumn are yang phases; the first months of winter and summer are yin phases.\n\nThus, life and death, control and command employ spring and autumn; storage and accumulation employ winter and summer. It is also said: men should use spring and autumn, while women should use winter and summer.\n\nMoreover, the three steps and nine traces emulate the three origins and nine qi. The twelve traces emulate the twelve pitch-pipes. The fifteen traces emulate the numbers of three and five.\n\nThe art of adapting to circumstances lies in the subtleties of the method’s weight and measure. Yet it is called \"Yu’s Steps\" because Great Yu, in regulating the waters, accomplished a work that covered the heavens. He was truly bestowed this step-method to control spirits and summon numinous beings, hence it was named \"Yu’s Steps.\"\n\nIn all step-treading methods, visualize the body as the Envoy of the Demon-Quelling Court, the Orthodox Unity Dharma Master, the Three Origins and Five Virtues General, the Clerk and Merit Officers, the Lion and White Crane, with an array of attendants standing guard.\n\nFirst recite the Purification Mantra. According to the scriptural method, stepping with the mind focused on the spirit is especially efficacious; one need not rely solely on physical traces.\n\nThe scripture states: \"Yu’s Steps were received by Yu from the Most High, unfolding the celestial net and earthly principles. Externally, they are Yu’s Steps, seeking the true and restraining the hundred things—humans, spirits, dragons, ghosts, evil beasts, venomous insects—subduing them without killing. Those who resist and do not submit are executed.\"\n\nIts principles include combining the five dipper-stars into three steps and nine traces, or twelve traces, or thirty-five traces, or fifteen traces. There are also methods for reversing and circling three times, which are listed below.\n\nWhen stepping the seven stars, proceed from the first to the seventh, called \"forward progression.\" Then reverse from the seventh back. Return again from the first to the seventh, called \"reverse progression.\" The \"earthly gate\" signifies ascending from the earthly gate to heaven.\n\n**Method of Three Steps and Nine Traces**\nThe scripture states: \"First, as the Flying Celestial Net treading the Earthly Principles, Yu’s Steps transform into nine traces, also corresponding to the Dipper’s numbers, circling forward, backward, and reverse three times. Stepping three times is not as effective as performing the Three Nets three times. If one seeks swift efficacy, simply step the old net three times, once on the left and once on the right—men emphasize the left, women the right. After completing left and right, repeat once more, totaling three presses.\"\n\n**Method of Twelve-Trace Yu’s Steps**\n**Method of Three-Five-Trace Yu’s Steps**\n**Method of Treading Earthly Principles and Flying Celestial Net**\nFor Yu’s Steps of the Flying Celestial Net treading Earthly Principles, all must be performed in reverse three times.\n\nThe scripture states: \"For those who perform hidden merits to aid the state, protect the body, and save others, first tread the Earthly Principles three times, then fly the Celestial Net three times, then disperse into the three-step, nine-trace Yu’s Steps, turning the Celestial Pivot to strike and halt. If fearing it will not stop, perform the twelve-step Yu’s Steps once, or step fifteen steps. Visualize the upper, middle, and lower Three Generals, their troops, and the Six Jia spirits, turning the Celestial Pivot to point at them. Doing this three times will dissolve all matters without harming the lives of yin spirits or creatures. If performed six times, what is controlled can be destroyed, restraining its reckless actions and diminishing one’s merit and virtue.\"\n\nThe scripture states: \"When stepping to control or destroy, simultaneously form the Knife-Finger Seal with the left and right hands, on the third joint of the fifth finger. When dealing with violent people, form the Knife-Finger Seal for evil persons on the right side of the third joint of the right hand’s fifth finger. The right governs killing, the left governs life; do not act recklessly, and carefully examine the principles. To subdue evil ghosts, form the Ghost-Knife Seal on the underside of the third joint of the left hand’s fifth finger.\"\n\nThe scripture states: \"For malevolent spirits, poisonous dragons, demonic ghosts causing reckless storms and violent rains that harm people and things, whether on water or land, step the Celestial Net and Earthly Principles each three times, dispersing into nine, twelve, or fifteen traces of Yu’s Steps, or perform three reversals. First nine steps, then reverse to the net’s head, then perform twelve steps, then reverse to fifteen steps. Align left and right with clothing, grasp the Dipper-Star with the left hand and point. Turn the Celestial Pivot, raising the hand to point three, six, or nine times, three rounds, and the poisonous demons will cease. Six rounds will cause harm and illness; nine rounds will result in death. Though this is a method of restraint and killing not of the Dao, one must not fail to be cautious in its principles. Assess the demonic affliction; if it ceases, release it, and do not kill immediately. If people and things are unsettled, or there are droughts, floods, or baleful stars, all can be restrained and governed.\"\n\nThe various diagrams of the Celestial Net, Earthly Principles, and Three-Five Yu’s Steps are of great importance, each with its own scriptural methods. Here, only the essentials are briefly outlined, so that practitioners of the method may know the ladder to its profound mysteries and recognize the threshold of the Original True.\n\n**Purification Mantra for Ascending Steps**\n\"I purify my body with the sun, refine my true nature with the moon. Immortals assist me; sun and moon aid my form. The twenty-eight constellations unite with me; a thousand evils and ten thousand impurities are swept away by water and made clear.

He is under the governance of the Star Lord of the [Specific] Star of the Northern Dipper and awaits the celestial response.\n\n**Recommending Master:** Your servant [Name and Title]\n**Supervising Master:** Your servant [Name and Title]\n**Transmitting Master:** Your servant [Name and Title]\n\nThe orthodox arts of the Three Heavens share a single source with the myriad Daoist teachings. How much more so when my words are easy to follow—how could your heart find them difficult to uphold? You are hereby appointed as Right Judge of the Northern Culmen Bureau for Expelling Demonic Influences, concurrently managing its affairs. This decree is enacted in accordance with the established protocols.\n\n**Right Decree** issued by command of the **Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor**; upon receipt of the talisman, comply and act accordingly. Dated the [Day] day of the [Month] month of the [Year].\n\n**Transmitting Master:** Your servant [Name and Title]\n**Proclamation issued.**\n\n**Petition of Gratitude for Appointment and Celestial Response (Template)**\n\nYour servant [Name] humbly states: I have heard that the Great Dao is formless, nurturing and embracing the myriad transformations; the supreme virtue does not dominate, yet it revolves and governs the Three Origins. All things flourish and manifest, with the most numinous at their head. The unitive Dao is not apart from its root; the essence of guarding the One arises from sincerity.\n\nLooking upon my own humble talents, I have been granted participation among the ranks of immortals. With awe and reverence, I bow my head again and again. I reverently consider the **Great Clarity Supreme Emperor**, the **Ancestral Master Supreme Clarity Supreme Emperor**, and the **Jade Clarity Supreme Emperor**, who holds the tally and governs the celestial mandate as the **Dao Lord of Nine Hundred Ninety-Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Million**; who opened the earth in the Red Brightness and Dragon Han eras as the **Scriptural Treasure of Ten Titles, Ten Perfected, and Hundred Spirits’ Source**.\n\nThe orthodox arts of the Three Heavens and the true talismans of the Five Emperors spread transformation, bestow auspiciousness, and extend their radiance in response to all things. Though I dwell in lowliness and baseness, I have presumptuously received the profound teachings, escaped the dusty world, and rejoiced in being ranked among the registers of immortals. How dare I not uphold the celestial precepts above and fulfill human sentiments below, taking the relief of suffering as my heart and the repayment of kindness as my duty?\n\nI respectfully present this petition in gratitude, daring to intrude upon Your Celestial Majesty. My humble feelings are overwhelmed with longing for the sagely response, trembling with awe.\n\nYour servant [Name], with awe and reverence, bows his head again and again, respectfully states.\n\nPetition presented on the [Day] day of the [Month] month of the [Year of the Great Era], by your servant [Full Title and Name].\n\n---\n\n**Method for Establishing the Celestial Prison**\n\nWhen establishing the Celestial Prison, first select a location according to the directional guidelines and prepare a pure chamber, ensuring it is secure and tightly sealed. Sweep and purify it thoroughly before constructing the prison.\n\n**Directional Formula**\nIn the first month, [build] at *zi*; the fifth and ninth months share the same [direction].\nIn the second month, the sixteenth [day] is in the Rabbit Garden.\nThe third and seventh [months], the eleventh [day], are within the Horse Pen.\nThe fourth and eighth [months], the twelfth [day], enter the Chicken Coop.\n\nWhen establishing the prison, first transform the spirit. Then take three steps in the *ding* register, visualizing two blue-clad youths holding sword seals standing to the left and right. Assume the role of the **Expelling Demonic Influences Bureau Envoy**, wearing the **Interlocking Harmony Crown** and the **Fish-Scale Robe**. Hold the **Samādhi Fire Bell Sword** in the right hand and the **Lord of the Celestial Law Seal** in the left.\n\nWithin the prison chamber, step through the **Seven Stars Register**, having an assistant follow each step to insert bamboo stakes. Then take a left-twisted hemp rope and strike each star in sequence.\n\nFirst, write two **Summoning Ghost Talismans**, one in cinnabar and one in ink. Attach five paper coins to the front of the prison. Burn the talismans while visualizing the **Summoning Ghost Talisman Envoy** in the form of a swift runner. Then form the **Summoning Ghost Mudra** (the mudra is found in the eighth scroll) and recite the incantation:\n\n> *\"Celestial Prison, numinous and bright,*\n> *By the Emperor’s command, act with might.*\n> *The Celestial Law’s decree is stern,*\n> *Seize and bind the demonic, show no concern.*\n> *Swiftly, swiftly, as the law ordains!\"*\n\nTake a strip of paper and write in cinnabar:\n*\"By order of Mount Tai, the attending divine generals are to apprehend all malevolent ghosts and spirits causing harm and bring them to this prison.\"*\n\nAbove this text, write the title and rank of the ritual master in one line, followed by a decorative flourish. Above the flourish, write *\"By the Emperor’s Decree.\"*\n\nRecite the previous **Celestial Prison Incantation**, then form the **Supreme Emperor Mudra** and the **Celestial Soldier Mudra**, and affix the paper to the bamboo stake of the Celestial Prison.\n\nVisualize black silk transforming into dark clouds, and the **Northern Dipper** manifesting as the **Dark Celestial Prison**. On yang days, use lime; on yin days, use charcoal ash, each seven inches wide.\n\nEstablish the prison beneath the **Military Brilliance Star**, making it round and twelve inches in diameter. Use nine green bamboo stalks, each four feet and nine inches long. The stars and prison are delineated with fine ash, and bamboo stakes mark each position. The bamboo serves as the upright prison officers.\n\nUse nine strips of black silk, each nine inches long and one inch two-tenths wide, tied seven inches below the top of the bamboo stakes. Write the names of the Eight Stars in cinnabar on the black silk.\n\nThe prison is closed by day and opened by night. Take care to avoid disturbance, and do not use lamps or candles.\n\nWhen treating illness, point the register toward the patient’s bedchamber. For other matters, point the register toward the monthly branch.\n\nIf after two nights no traces appear in the Celestial Prison, repeat the previous written instructions to urge the attending divine generals. Affix a large inscription of *\"Celestial Prison\"* to the door of the prison chamber.\n\nWhether there is a response or not, proceed according to the circumstances, following the **Yang Dao Public Law** without yielding to human sentiment.\n\nThe establishment of the prison must not be witnessed by others; only the ritual master should enter and exit regularly.\n\nThe **Five Prison Masters of the Expelling Demonic Influences Bureau** and the **Direct Altar Earth Deity** must first be offered paper money and horses.\n\n---\n\n**Summoning Ghost Talisman Formula**\n\nWhen writing the talisman, face the monthly branch. When burning it, recite the prayer:\n*\"All malevolent spirits causing harm, swiftly return to your origin and be seized!\"*\n\n---\n\n**Method for Verifying Ghost Traces in the Prison**\n\nIf the ghost is fierce and violent, it will manifest in its true form. If it is a yin and subtle ghost, only traces will appear.\n\nIf the patient’s life is fated to end, a double trace will appear beneath their natal star in the prison, indicating the arrival of the **Soul-Summoning Envoy**. Examine this carefully and promptly dissolve the prison.\n\n- **Chicken traces** indicate a visiting death.\n- **Human traces**, large or small, indicate the **Five Penetrations**.\n- **Cat, rat, or fox traces** indicate mountain spirits.\n- **Human hands or feet** indicate fierce and violent mountain deities.\n- **Snake or earthworm traces** indicate kitchen gods, Buddhist statues, earth deities, altar mats, or ancestral ghosts.\n- **Goose or duck traces** with bloodstains indicate ghosts of violent death.\n- **Raised mounds** indicate temple or monastic spirits causing harm.\n- **Small traces like knife cuts** indicate disturbances from construction in the household.\n- **Mule, donkey, ox, or horse traces**, large, indicate household **gu** poison; small, indicate neighboring **gu** poison.\n- **Rope-drag marks** indicate hanging ghosts.\n- **Chaotic ant-like traces** indicate **consumptive corpse ghosts**.\n- **Traces like a small finger, uniform at both ends**, indicate **tomb-curse ghosts**; smaller ones indicate disturbances from mountains, forests, slopes, or ponds.\n- **Traces resembling a small finger with one end larger** indicate **water ghosts**.\n\n---\n\n**Method for Dissolving the Celestial Prison**\n\n**Method for Dissolving the Celestial Prison**\n\nTransform the deity into the **Director of the Demon-Quelling Court**, commanding the ghosts and spirits to first appear at the **Star Altar**, then submit their case in accordance with the law, petitioning **Mount Tai** for resolution. Issue a writ to the divine generals to take them into custody and escort them beneath the mountain, where each shall be sealed with an official document. Once completed, offer **paper money and spirit horses**, then instruct the two divine generals to order the generals dispatched from **Mount Tai** and those under the **City God** to swiftly take charge of the malevolent ghosts and spirits afflicting the household, bringing them before the court to await further command. Upon their arrival, issue the following instructions:\n\nFirst, bestow upon them **wine, food, paper money, and spirit horses** according to their rank. Then, hand over the writs for their custody and escort, and have an attendant dismantle the prison and burn it, scattering the ashes into the river. The format for the petition is detailed in **Scroll Ten**.\n\n**Method for Erecting the Terrace of Ascension to Heaven**\n\nExamine the petition carefully, ensuring the grievances are clearly stated, and proceed accordingly. If the cause is not precisely identified, send an official document to **Mount Tai**, requesting that divine generals, along with the local **City God**, the **Household Deities**, the **Five Paths**, the village and community temple spirits, and all other relevant deities—both within and beyond the household—thoroughly investigate: What manner of person is this? Which sorcerer or shaman aided them? At which ghostly shrine did they make their vows? What offerings did they pledge? Who was wrongfully killed, and why has their grievance not been resolved?\n\nThe court shall then construct a **Terrace of Ascension to Heaven** at the afflicted person’s home. The divine generals are to escort the responsible spirits to the terrace. Upon arrival, proceed with the rite, addressing the aggrieved soul thus:\n\n*\"Disciple [Name]—you and I once shared enmity. Why do you persist in clinging to the netherworld, bringing harm to this extent? Now, [Name] lies stricken with illness. For your sake, I have prepared grand offerings—**vegetarian feasts, rituals, scriptures, paper money, and spirit horses**—to aid your ascent to heaven from this terrace. Henceforth, you must reform your heart and amend your ways. Cease your former obstinacy. Should you defy this command, your grievances shall persist through kalpas, and you will be unable to attain rebirth. If you refuse my words, I shall bind you in the **Dipper Prison**, shatter your form and shadow, and reduce you to dust. Swiftly obey this decree!\"*\n\nOnce the ritual transformation is complete, issue a writ to the divine generals, entrusting them to escort the spirits to **Mount Tai**. Enlist the **local earth deities** along the route to ensure their safe passage, delivering them before the **Prefect of the Underworld**. There, petition the Prefect to swiftly report the case, annul the grievance, retrieve the written complaint, and permit the soul’s ascent to heaven.\n\nThe **Terrace of Ascension to Heaven** shall be constructed in the **direction of vital qi**, using **sweet flag, sandalwood, and aloeswood** mixed with wine and water to form three layers of sand:\n- The base: **two feet wide, three inches high**.\n- The middle: **one foot five inches wide, two inches high**.\n- The top: **one foot wide, seven inches high**.\n\nAtop the upper layer, place a mirror centered over the heart. At the four corners of the middle layer, set four lamps. Before the terrace, light the Seven Star Lamps, their stems pointing toward the sick person’s chamber. On the terrace, inscribe a placard with the words: *Terrace of Ascension to Heaven*. Additionally, arrange a small table bearing seasonal fruits, incense, lamps, tea, and wine as offerings. Behind the table, place a plaque three fingers wide and six inches tall, inscribed: *Reverent bows to the Supreme Emperor of Highest Clarity, Ancestral Master*. The plaque shall be crafted from *fuyan* wood. Then, recite the petition three times, stating the matter’s intent. Humbly implore the Supreme Emperor of Highest Clarity, Ancestral Master, to issue a special decree and act in accordance with this petition.\n\n**Design of the Terrace of Ascension to Heaven**\n**Method for the Protective Canopy (Huagai)**\nFirst, submit a memorial to the Celestial Emperor, petitioning the Seven Kings of the Northern Dipper and Mount Tai to dispatch orders to the local City God, who shall assign divine generals alongside the household’s Controller of Destiny and local earth deities to vigilantly guard the persons under the protective canopy, ensuring no misfortunes befall them within the year. Once the ritual dispatch is complete, the memorial’s format is provided in the subsequent scroll.\n\nNext, take an iron pillar as thick as a thumb, twelve inches long, symbolizing the twelve months. Engrave seven segments upon it, representing the seven palaces of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Kings, visualized as a jeweled hall of golden steps and jade chambers. Prepare a small, purified vase to hold a talisman, and an iron plate seven inches long and two inches wide, inscribed with the *Three Luminaries Talisman* to consecrate it.\n\n**Design of the Iron Pillar**\n**Design of the Iron Plate Talisman**\nThe talisman shall be inscribed on a piece of yellow silk twelve inches long. At the top, inscribe the Three Terraces; at the bottom, the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, symbolizing the Seven Kings’ palaces. Beneath each corresponding star, write the disciple’s name, along with the year, month, day, and hour.\n\n**Design of the Silk Talisman**\nPlace the silk talisman into the vase, along with the protective canopy fee corresponding to the number of persons covered. Bury a large vase beneath the canopy’s location, and position the small vase in the *Hua Gai* direction for the current month, digging a hole twelve inches deep to inter it. The *Hua Gai* directions are provided in the subsequent scroll.\n\nThereafter, perform the divine transformation, pacing the Seven Star Net, employing the *Heavenly Ding* mudra. Begin at *Greedy Wolf* and conclude at *Breaking Army* to enact the prohibition. While pacing the net, recite the incantation:\n\n*Mighty Northern Dipper, radiant Dipper’s handle star.\nGreedy Wolf wields malice, devouring ghosts and consuming essence.\nMajestic Gate shines resplendent, illuminating with brilliance.\nWealth Star races through mist, commanding talismanic soldiers.\nRosy clouds surge through Literary Star, light piercing Integrity Star.\nMighty Martial Star, true person’s auxiliary star.\nGreat Sage of the Celestial Net, swiftly, swiftly, as the law decrees!*\n\nDeposit the fee and talisman into the vase. When placing the protective canopy, recite the incantation:\n\n*Heaven is my canopy, Earth my support.\nThe Northern Dipper’s suspended stars are my raiment.\nI shelter my disciple, [Name], and [number] persons,\nwithin the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper,\nin the courtyard of flowing fire.\nNeither stems nor branches shall harm them.\nThose who aid me are the Great Yang.\nThose who oppose me shall perish.*\n\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the law decrees!\nBury the vase with the prohibition charm, plant the iron talisman at the front, and set the iron pillar at the rear.\nThen visualize the Four Heavenly Gate Kings stationed at the four corners, and imagine the person sheltered by the canopy residing in the Palace of the Seven Kings.\nNext, envision the City God dispatching soldiers to encircle and patrol in protection.\nWhen done, click the teeth and withdraw. At year’s end, open the canopy and prepare wine, food, paper money, and horses to offer to the sacred assembly within the talisman, the Three Terraces of the Northern Dipper, and the stars of one’s natal destiny. According to one’s means, hold a thanksgiving jiao ritual to repay their grace and protection.\nAlso reward the patrolling divine generals and their troops, as well as the local earth god. Submit a formal document to each, dispatching them back to their respective peaks to report completion.\nOnce the generals have received and acknowledged the troops, request a confirming response.\n\n**Decree-Character Longevity Lamp Formula**\nForty-nine lamps for the *Decree* character, thirty-six for the *Extend* character, and twenty-four for the *Life* character.\nFor treating pestilence, madness, and demonic afflictions, or for thanksgiving rituals, light these lamps. They may also be lit regularly to repel plague and extend life.\nUse lime to mark the positions, then place and light the lamps.\nFirst, pace the Seven Stars’ Net and recite the incantation:\n\n*Northern Dipper’s seven stars, jade perfected immortals divine.\nGreedy Wolf and Majestic Gate, guard me with eternal glory.\nWealth Star and Literary Star, grant me wisdom and clarity.\nIntegrity Star and Martial Star, preserve my peace and tranquility.\nBreaking Army and Auxiliary Stars, shield my body and form.\nEver dwell in fortune’s embrace, forever secure in blessed years.\nInscribe me in the register of life, erase my name from death’s scroll.\nSpirit pure, qi pristine, penetrating the hidden and obscure.\nCommand demons, seize ghosts, all malevolent spirits crushed and overthrown.\nCultivating Dao, refining truth, may my wish be fulfilled.\nThe Seven Primes lend their protection, ascending to the Purple Court on high.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the law decrees!*\n\nEmploy the Five Thunder Hand Seal, flash the eyes three times to fill the room with lightning, then form the Triggering Seal and recite the Lamp-Lighting Incantation:\n\n*By the Emperor’s decree, the Dipper’s lamps are lit.\nThe Seven Kings descend to illuminate and guard all beings.\nLeft and right, the Auxiliary Stars manifest their mighty power.\nHeavenly Marshal Tianpeng commands the celestial troops.\nEnvoys of the Five Thunders, the Six Jia and Six Ding spirits,\nGreat Sage of the Dark Warrior, the Three Stars of the Terrace.\nBanish illness, dispel misfortune, execute and slay demonic spirits.\nThe three hun souls fortify the body, the seven po souls rest in peace.\nThose who defy this decree shall perish; those who uphold it shall prosper.\nA single point of Longevity’s light illumines body and home.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the law decrees!*\n\nThen light the lamps. If a person’s illness lingers and resists medical treatment, these lamps should be lit.\nFirst, use sixty-four ounces of pure oil, one ounce of wood, one ounce of licorice, one fen of borneol, one ounce of peach twigs (each nine inches long), half an ounce of realgar, and half an ounce of cinnabar. Except for the cinnabar, steep all ingredients in the oil for seven days, facing the direction of Longevity. Guard it with the Great Black Destruction Talisman, and seal the bottle’s mouth with the Three Lights Talisman. When the days are complete, remove the herbs, pour the oil into a clean lamp, and coat the lamp’s green rim thickly with cinnabar.\nFrom the patient’s natal star, hold the breath, pace the Net, and light the lamp as before, directing the Dipper’s handle toward the patient’s bedroom.\nDo not use paper wicks; ignite the lamp with pine resin. Do not leak qi.\nIf, on that night, the lamp corresponding to the patient’s natal star extinguishes first, inform the household: the case is beyond saving.\nIf the lamp burns brightly and moths fly into it, the person will recover and the ghost will be subdued.\nIf moths live but the lamp dies, the ghost thrives and the person weakens.\nCarefully observe these signs at the time. If the lamp dims but does not extinguish, the person’s life is not in danger—only the illness remains unresolved.\n\n**Lamp Divination for Household Fortune and Misfortune**\nOn the six assembly nights, arrange the ritual as before to divine outcomes. Bright lamps signify good fortune; dim lamps, misfortune.\n- **Blue light**: Hidden corpse qi.\n- **Red light**: Bloodshed or calamity.\n- **White light**: Mourning or external bereavement.\n- **Black light**: Illness or legal troubles.\n- **Yellow light**: Pestilential qi.\n- **Long, steady flame**: Auspicious.\n- **Flame forming a wheel**: Inauspicious.\n- **Dims then brightens**: Impending misfortune.\n\n**Canopy of Flowers Method**\n- **First month**: Zi direction.\n- **Second month**: Chou direction.\n- **Third month**: Yin direction.\n- **Fourth month**: Mao direction.\n- **Fifth month**: Chen direction.\n- **Sixth month**: Si direction.\n- **Seventh month**: Wu direction.\n- **Eighth month**: Wei direction.\n- **Ninth month**: Shen direction.\n- **Tenth month**: You direction.\n- **Eleventh month**: Xu direction.\n- **Twelfth month**: Hai direction.\n\nEach month, in its designated direction, erect the canopy and the Platform of Heavenly Birth, and light the Longevity Lamp—this is called the *Canopy of Flowers*.\n\n**Purple Tenuity’s Seven Governors: Method of the Living Celestial Luminaries and Heavenly Rigidity**\nWhere Heavenly Rigidity descends, all malevolent spirits and baleful stars flee in terror, daring not to confront it.\nThe Seven Stars revolve day and night across the azure sky,\nWith the Dipper’s bowl at the head and Rigidity at the tail’s edge.\nOne day contains twelve hours; within twelve hours, Rigidity begins at Xu.\n*Formula*:\nEvery night at the Xu hour, place Rigidity at Xu.\nAlign it with the month’s branch, shifting one position per hour.\nRepeat this cycle without end; the method remains unchanged for ten thousand years.\n\n**Ancient Heavenly Rigidity Method**\nEach month, Rigidity is always added to Xu; each hour, it begins at Breaking Army.\nBefore the Sun passes its palace, start at Hai.\nAfter the Sun passes its palace, start at Xu.\nAlways begin with the month’s branch, starting from Hai or Xu, and at the correct hour, Heavenly Rigidity’s movement becomes apparent.\n\n**Determining the Sun’s Direction**\nIn the first and ninth months, exit Yi and enter Geng.\nIn the second and eighth months, seek the Rabbit and enter You’s rigidity.\nIn the third and seventh months, ascend Jia and enter Xin’s position.\nIn the fourth and sixth months, emerge from Yin and arrive at Xu’s land.\nIn the fifth month, enter Qian from Gen.\nIn the tenth month, the body enters Kun from Xun.\nIn the eleventh and twelfth months, reside at Chen—\nThis is the Celestial Heart harmonizing with the Sun.\n\n**Determining the Moon’s Direction**\nIn the first and ninth months, begin at Chou’s position.\nIn the second and eighth months, return to the Water Palace of Zi.\nIn the third and seventh months, Hai’s direction; in the fourth and sixth, Xu.\nIn the fifth month, the Western Heaven’s true return to the East.\nIn the eleventh and twelfth months, reside at Chen.\nCount forward by hours, retreat one palace.\n\nWhen the Moon’s radiance descends to illuminate,\nThis is where moonlight and qi converge in union.\n\n**Method for Entering the Divination Stance**\nThe art of entering the divination stance is wondrous and profound:\nAlign the Moon’s General with the hour at the position’s apex.\nObserve which spirit shares the same place,\nThen invoke the person’s origin from the day’s stem.\nThe subduer becomes the origin, judged by its vigor;\nExamine closely within the Five Phases.\nDiscern the spirits and generals to detail fortune or misfortune,\nThen scrutinize the visitor to perceive the truth.\nThe moving is the guest, the unmoving the host;\nThe generals represent wealth—observe their clashes.\nIf the host subdues wealth, wealth remains inert;\nIf wealth subdues the host, they contend for office.\nIf the guest subdues the host, they come to demand goods;\nIf the host subdues the guest, the guest departs displeased.\nWhen aligned with one’s native place, wealth remains inert;\nIf they harmonize, listen for joy and reunion.\nTwo Woods as lines make wealth hard to obtain;\nTwo Earths together bring delay.\nTwo Metals clashing bring no harmony;\nTwo Fires bring disaster, all affairs ruined.\nTwo Waters are most auspicious;\nWater entering Fire unsettles the wife.\nMetal entering Wood’s domain stirs quarrels;\nFire entering Metal’s domain brings hardship.\nWood entering Earth leads to imprisonment;\nEarth entering Water sparks disputes over fields.\nWhen the above subdues the below, it comes from without;\nWhen the below subdues the above, it turns outward.\nCommonly take *yin* and *shen* as noble guests;\n*zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* for feasts of wine and food.\n*si* and *hai* must come to demand goods;\n*chen* and *xu* bring lawsuits and lingering strife.\n*chou* pertains to copper, iron, gold, and silver;\n*xiaoji* concerns women and wasted wine and food.\nWhen the four positions harmonize, all affairs are auspicious—\nNo need to speak of clashes within.\nThis is Sun Bin’s true *jiazi* method,\nBrought from heaven and earth into the palm’s transmission.\n\n**Method for Determining Illness**\nTo inquire about a person’s age and the root of their illness,\nAlign the Moon’s General with the hour and transmit to their fate.\nEncountering Wood indicates wind and qi disorders;\n*you* Metal’s fullness connects to the lungs.\nMeeting Fire generates heat both inside and out;\nSeeing Water brings cold illness to the waist.\nEncountering Earth with clashes causes sores and swelling;\nHarmony eases the body’s afflictions.\nTo see an eagle’s circling, seek the auspicious *chou*;\nObserve alongside the noble spirit’s position.\n\n**Alternative Method**\nThe method for divining illness requires discussion:\nAlign the Moon’s General with the hour at the position’s apex.\nThe four cardinal points (*zi*, *wu*, *mao*, *you*) speak of severe suffering;\nThe four seasonal beginnings (*yin*, *shen*, *si*, *hai*) are celestial afflictions.\nThe four transitions (*chen*, *xu*, *chou*, *wei*) define chronic illness;\nOnly by observing clashes can one judge its depth.\nSubduing Metal causes wheezing; subduing Earth brings bloating;\nSubduing Water brings many hardships.\nSubduing Wood harms the liver;\nSubduing Fire affects the heart.\nThis is the immortals’ true esoteric formula—\nSun Bin’s ten methods, not to be transmitted lightly.\n\n**Method for Determining Life and Death in Illness**\nDiscern life and death from the visitor’s direction;\nThe noble spirit and Moon’s General are used together.\nIf the noble spirit and general clash,\nKnow the illness is grave and difficult to halt.\nIf the person’s origin and position are further harmed,\nStupor and sinking indicate it is hard to cure.\nFate and wealth injured by Wood or Metal qi—\nThis text’s secrets align with the immortals’ intent.\n\n**Method for Determining Life and Death by Ghostly Limits**\n*Jiazi* and *jiawu* transmit through the Nine Palaces;\n*Yigeng* and *bingen* follow the Eight Paths of the year.\n*Bingsin* and *gengxin* occupy the Seven Positions of *yin* and *shen*;\n*Dingren* and *renren* speak of the Six Paths of *mao* and *you*.\n*Wugui* and *guikui* hold the Five Positions of *chen* and *xu*;\n*Jihai*’s Four Killers trace to the root.\nThe year and fate align with the day’s branch and stem—\nSee which palace and constellation they connect to.\nOne is *kan*, two is Earth, three resides in Thunder;\nFour is Wind, five is unspeakable.\nSix seeks *ding*’s companionship, passing through seven dwellings;\nNine Fire Immortals traverse eight mountains.\nAt *Lichun*, *gen* flourishes on the mountain’s peak;\nThe eight nodes follow the hexagrams’ flowing sequence.\nFlourishing, resting, conceived, or waning—no other matters;\nImprisoned or dead in *fei*—midnight brings sorrow.\nIf within this there is decline or encountering ghosts,\nPrepare the coffin and head to the barren hills.\n\n**Removal Method**\nWater one, Fire two, Wood three,\nMetal four, Earth five, six seven eight nine ten—\nBlack, red, green, white, yellow.\nHeaven removes one, Earth removes two,\nHumans remove three and four, hours remove four and five,\nMovement removes five and six, *jia* removes six and seven,\nStars remove seven and eight, hexagrams remove eight and nine,\nLuminaries remove nine—what remains is the lifespan.\nCombine with the ghost’s number, discerning by position\nThe color of their garments and eyes.\n\n**Method for Locating Hidden Corpses**\nFinding hidden corpses is not difficult—\nThis method originally holds wondrous subtlety.\nAlign the Moon’s General with the hour to know the place;\nBeneath *Ludu*, the hidden corpse lies.\n*Yigeng* and *bingsin* seek the direction;\n*Dingren* and *renren* lie beside *qian* at *hai*.\nOn *jiaji* days, beneath *xiaoji*,\nBeneath *Ludu* is the dry spring.\n*Ludu*’s *wuji* hides the corpse;\nWhere it subdues *Lu*, the response is hard to obtain.\n\n**Method for Divining the Spirit Behind Afflictions**\nWhen someone comes to divine the spirit’s intent,\nAlign the Moon’s General with the hour and seek the direction.\n*hai* is for parents, the Northern *Tai* Mountain spirit;\n*si* is the hearth’s household spirit causing affliction.\n*zi* is the ditch dragon, the Dark Warrior spirit;\n*wu* is scalding harm, vexation in the heart.\n*chou* is the hidden corpse, the River Earl’s spirit;\n*wei* is the inner palace or self-hanging.\n*yin* is for blades and weapons, the Tree Dragon spirit;\n*shen* is for vows and merits causing affliction.\n*mao* is for those who died away from home;\n*you* is for Buddhist statues and birth-death ghosts.\n*chen* is the Celestial Heart, the household spirit;\n*xu* is for offending the household earth deity.\n\n**Diagram for Divining the Spirit in Illness**\nWhenever examining illness, simply ask the visitor:\nIn which direction does the afflicted person lie?\nFor example, if in *dui*, know it is the household spirit of the youngest girl.\nThe rest follow this pattern—\nAt the time, write talismans, draft petitions,\nOr use charms to expel and drive away.\n\n**Method for Auspicious and Inauspicious Hours for Talismans**\nOn *jiayi* days, in *yin* and *mao*.\nOn *bingding* days, in *chen* and *si*.\nOn *wuji* days, in *wu* and *wei*.\nOn *gengxin* days, in *shen* and *you*.\nOn *renkui* days, in *xu* and *hai*.\nOn the above days, performing talismans to treat illness is forbidden—greatly inauspicious.\n\n**Method for Using Talismans to Treat Illness**\nWhen

owls for good fortune.\n\nWhen visiting a patient’s home, avoid entering from the direction of the Earthly Prison. Neither should the patient face the direction of the Prison when the master treats them.\n\nIf a person’s fate aligns with the Celestial Soul or Earthly Corpse, talismans must not be written nor sent on that day—violation brings death.\n\nDuring the month when the Celestial Soul or Earthly Corpse direction is active, do not drive talismans into the earth—transgression causes crop and silkworm failure, and all affairs turn inauspicious.\n\nFor example, those born under *ding*, *gui*, *jia*, or *geng* must not write talismans for others in the first or fourth month, nor provide talismans to those born under *ding* or *gui*—this is the principle.\n\nWhen the Monthly Virtue direction is active, move the patient to that position for treatment—auspicious.\n\n**Seasonal Position of the Celestial Unity**\nSpring: *mao*\n\nSummer: *wu*.\nAutumn: *you*.\nWinter: *zi*.\n\nWhenever writing talismans, if the downward illumination falls upon the Noble One’s direction, it is most auspicious. Alternatively, arrange a Celestial Unity seat, placing talismans upon it according to the direction’s color and qi number, and perform rites. Spring: nine; summer: three; autumn: seven; winter: five.

The Orthodox Unity transmitted its lineage, elucidating awe-inspiring majesty to reveal the hidden and the bound. Thus, divine scriptures and wondrous canons, though timely in their emergence, must align with the moment. The primordial statutes and true regulations truly serve as warnings against reckless transmission.\n\nWith reverence, I acknowledge the benevolent sagacity of the sovereign above, who has received the Heavenly Mandate, propagated the supreme Dao, and achieved perfection. Recently, a Palace of Precious Registers was established in the capital, and an ordination altar was set near the imperial precincts. Through talismanic remedies and healing elixirs, the well-being of the common people is safeguarded. Those who receive profound blessings number in the thousands daily, while those who turn toward the true wind account for eight or nine out of ten.\n\nI have gathered and sought out immortal scriptures, mending omissions and completing lacunae. From all corners of the realm, nothing has been left uncollected. Now, I have compiled and collated these secret treasures, intending to engrave and transmit them for eternity, that the world may be steeped in primordial purity and the people may cultivate their nature and destiny. This may indeed be called an era of pure and complete *Dao*-*qi*, an age of ten thousand generations of Great Peace.\n\nYour servant, by early fortune, has been graced with this opportunity, humbly dwelling among the feathered ranks. I have traversed the renowned mountains and sacred peaks of the four directions, seeking out masters and their teachings. For over thirty years, I have roughly grasped the essentials, preparing them for practical application.

      "translated_text": "*Preface to the Supreme Clarity Northern Culmen Heavenly Heart Orthodox Methods, with the Petition and Protocol for the Bureau of Expelling Malevolence*\n\nI have heard that the Heavenly Heart Methods are the methods of the Northern Culmen and Central Dipper. The Northern Culmen is the central pole of Heaven, where all phenomena converge. The Northern Dipper is the central Dipper of Heaven, from which all qi is bestowed. Thus, as the heart of Heaven, these methods originate therefrom, sharing their lineage with the Orthodox Unity tradition and serving as the pivotal mechanism for exorcism and governance.\n\nSince ancient times, Master Rao Jun’s *Register of Hidden Merits* has been revered in celestial intent, with divine talismans conferred and secret oral instructions received upon the Purple Empyrean. The transmission of these methods has been passed down through successive lineages, thereby illuminating them for the world. Whether for summoning blessings, dispelling malevolence, discerning the principles of yin and yang, or distinguishing the affairs of the unseen and manifest realms, no matter is left unaddressed. The methods are concise in application, and none surpass these in efficacy.\n\nIn recent times, scholars of lofty conduct, aiding Heaven’s transformative work and assisting the nation to save the people, have particularly esteemed these methods. Yet in their application, some have found their efficacy lacking. This is due to transmissions that fail in profound erudition, studies that do not delve deeply into the ultimate techniques, Dao-powers that remain incomplete, and divine marvels that are scarcely prepared. Merely entangled in names and forms, how can such efforts yield benefit?\n\nI have therefore meticulously compiled the foundational methods along with their secret oral instructions, gathering talismans and seals, outlining the steps for pacing the Dipper’s network, and exhaustively elucidating the essentials of its peripheral connections and hidden mysteries. Obscure principles are clarified, and extant texts are briefly expounded, valuing practice and conveying the subtleties of the primordial and wondrous. May this work, in its dissemination, serve as an inexhaustible ford for those who traverse it.\n\nAccording to the statutes, the Heavenly Heart Orthodox Methods and the Supreme Clarity secret instructions require, for all transmissions, adherence to the prescribed time limits, declaration of the ritual protocols, and verification of the responses from the true and numinous. Only then may they be applied; unauthorized transmission is strictly forbidden. Violations of these prohibitions will not only render the divine qi ineffectual but also incur penalties from both the unseen and manifest realms, with calamities that are by no means light.\n\nThe protocols for transmission and ordination are set forth in the subsequent scrolls. Scholars should examine these with care.\n\n*Prayers, Supplications, and Exorcisms*",

      "translated_text": "When a nation prays for rain, whether enduring prolonged drought or suffering from locusts and pestilence that harm the people, or when baleful stars align with its astrological regions, or when border raiders invade its territory and enemy forces press near, or when flood dragons and water spirits capsize boats and sweep away lives—such matters, great or small, all require urgent memorials to Heaven, petitioning the Heavenly Hosts for extermination, and submitting writs to the celestial star palaces, the Five Peaks, the Four Watercourses, the Four Seas, the Nine Rivers, and the dragon deities. Dispatches must also be sent to the local city gods, the spirits of mountains, rivers, and roads governing the affected regions, as well as to the Six Dings, Six Jias, and the Cloud and Thunder Departments. The presiding spirit-officials must be duly appointed, or if commoners submit petitions, they shall declare that within such-and-such a domain, for such-and-such a matter, a ritual platform has been established at such-and-such a place, with the altar prepared in reverent anticipation. Once the response is manifest, a grand jiao offering shall be conducted to express gratitude for Heaven’s grace. The memorial shall record the dispatched officers and soldiers, who upon their return shall be rewarded with promotions and ranks as proof of efficacy. The rituals must be performed with utmost sincerity to ensure a clear and potent response; negligence or laxity will result in impeachment by the Four Offices, scrutiny by the Three Officials, and punishment for violating Heaven’s statutes—a crime that admits no pardon.\n\n**Treating Madness and Malevolent Spirits**\nTo treat afflictions caused by madness or malevolent spirits, first obtain a sworn statement from the afflicted detailing the circumstances. Based on the nature of the case, determine the appropriate authorities to petition. Begin by issuing a writ to the afflicted’s household Controller of Destiny and the Five Paths Earth God, then dispatch a memorial to the local prefectural or county city god. Alternatively, petition the relevant celestial battalion to capture the spirit, or memorialize Heaven to establish a celestial prison for its confinement. All official documents and dispatched troops must first be accompanied by offerings; only then shall writs, passes, and summons be issued for execution. Next, provide the afflicted with talismanic water for ingestion and wearing. After the grace is received, reward the soldiers again and conduct a vegetarian feast or jiao offering to thank Heaven for its divine favor. The scale of the jiao offering should be commensurate with the family’s wealth—modest for the poor, lavish for the rich. If the family is truly impoverished and unable to prepare the offerings, the master shall provide them on their behalf.

      "translated_text": "**Praying for Offspring**\n\nWhen a couple has been married for many years without bearing sons or daughters, or when children die in infancy, or when only daughters are born and no sons, or when young children perish prematurely—this may be due to the mutual affliction of the Six Harms, encountering solitary stars or barren constellations, or the accumulation of past misdeeds making it difficult to continue the lineage. In such cases, the birth years, months, days, and hours of the husband and wife must be recorded and urgently memorialized to Heaven, while also submitting a petition to the Register of Births and the Eastern Peak. A special request shall be made to bestow a son upon the petitioner. Talismans shall be issued for swallowing and wearing, and the couple must be instructed to perform meritorious deeds in advance, such as commissioning sacred images, and await the response of divine grace. Once the blessing is received, a vegetarian feast and jiao offering shall be held to thank the Perfected Ones for their benevolence.\n\n**Expiating Disasters and Illnesses**\n\nTo expiate disasters and repent of transgressions: when years of calamity and suffering confine one to bed, when medicine and food fail to cure, when prayers go unanswered—this may be due to the influence of stars and planets, the harm of vengeful spirits, violations of earthly taboos, or the karmic retribution of past deeds in this life, provoking Heaven’s censure and the false accusations of ghosts below. For those seeking expiation, repentance must come first. Hold a vegetarian feast, perform a jiao offering, present memorials, and submit petitions, hoping that the sagely Dao will take pity and absolve their faults. Only then may the crisis be resolved.\n\n**Destroying Unorthodox Shrines**\n\nTo destroy unorthodox shrines: these refer to deities not recognized in the state’s sacrificial canon, those who cling to trees and grass or lurk in springs and pools—wild specters and mountain spirits that harm people and things, demanding bloody sacrifices, spreading illness, and bringing every kind of misfortune. If complaints are filed, a petition shall be submitted to the Eastern Peak and urgently memorialized to Heaven, dispatching heavenly soldiers to capture and punish these deceitful and disorderly spirits. Their shrines shall be burned, and they shall be tried according to the law. If a private shrine, sustained by incense offerings, brings blessings to the local people, a petition with the testimony of community elders and neighbors shall be submitted to Heaven, requesting permission to rebuild the shrine and allow the people to continue their worship.\n\nAccording to the statutes on governing ghosts, official temples dedicated to deities in the state’s sacrificial canon must not be used to solicit private offerings, secretly accept bloody sacrifices, or permit curses that wrongfully seize living souls, imprisoning them and driving people to drown themselves, leap into fires, or inflict self-harm, abandoning their livelihoods and stirring up lawsuits. For all illnesses, misfortunes, and losses of family wealth, complaints may be filed with detailed accounts, and once verified, petitions shall be submitted to await divine response and enforcement. If living people have inadvertently offended the principles of the gods, bringing misfortune upon themselves, they may confess and make amends, but the gods must not harm the lives of the people. Even if offenses are grave, repentance shall still be permitted.\n\n**Miscellaneous Malevolent Qi and Other Matters**\n\nWhen ghosts and various malevolent entities spread pernicious qi, spoiling wine and vinegar, or when taboos are violated, causing household unrest; when ancient tombs are excavated and buried corpses cause harm; when livestock behave strangely, devouring their own young; when insects and rats cry out unnaturally, hens crow at night, or snakes and ants release venom into homes; when knives, spears, rods, and swords make phantom noises; when ghosts appear at night, filling the heart with terror; when spirits open and close doors, strike objects, arrange cups and utensils for feasts, or drive people to throw themselves into wells or hang themselves; when they make people weep or sing, or fill them with sorrow and discontent; when they dissipate family wealth, borrow others’ clothes, or set fires to burn homes; when they call out people’s names, or malevolent qi enters their hearts and bellies, causing nightmares, ghostly apparitions, and sleep disturbances; when they provoke lawsuits and disputes, discord between husband and wife, or difficult childbirth; when they ruin fields and silkworms, prevent crops from flourishing, cause merchants to suffer losses, or obstruct all endeavors; when ghosts and spirits gather in new homes, whirlwinds enter dwellings, foxes cry out in confusion, or large trees fall without wind; when cauldrons wail and overflow, household objects move on their own, or infants cry at night, disrupting the harmony of men and women; when servants flee, livestock die of plague, or ghosts appear in broad daylight, manifesting in eerie sounds, lights, and illusions—these myriad demonic harms and destructive forces are too numerous to recount in full.\n\nHere, a few examples are given so that it may be known that the law contains statutes to subdue them. No matter how great or small the matter, there are regulations to address it. However, if the handling of such cases lacks evidence and verges on deception, they shall not fall within the scope of enforcement. After receiving divine grace, the rites of rewarding the troops and offering thanks must be performed according to one’s means, and the rituals must not be entirely neglected.\n\nThe gods are not distant; they are before our very eyes and ears. If one fails to believe and instead mocks or profanes them, the sins will extend to past generations, the calamities will befall descendants, and disasters will arise swiftly—by then, regret will be too late.\n\nThe above excerpts from the statutes of the law are compiled into these several sections, clearly categorized and explained, easy to understand. They are illustrated and made known to the people. Those who suffer and seek remedy shall follow them without doubt. Those who disbelieve and profane them shall study and reflect, that they may come to repent.",

      "translated_text": "Take a small fire and burn the end of a stick of firewood, six inches in length, sharpening its tip. Scrape away the charred bark where burned, face south to transform into spirit, and make the mudra of your original master. Draw in the true qi of the Southern Fire Star, inhale one breath into your mouth, and blow it onto the tip of the stick. Inhale again and hold the breath, then inscribe the following twenty characters upon it. Place it beneath the bed, driving it into the moon’s broken phase. Take care to avoid disturbance.\n\n*I possess a fire-stirring rod,\nWhich I appoint as gatekeeper.\nSeizing the night-crying ghost,\nI shall not release it till dawn.*\n\nThere is a talisman—transmitted orally and imprinted upon the heart.\n\n**Method to Halt Headaches**\nUse the Three Lights Talisman and affix it to the temples. Then draw in the qi of Heavenly Rigor, exhaling upon it three times. The pain will immediately cease.\n\n**Method to Dispel Swelling Toxins**\nMake the Dipper Mudra and silently recite the Three Lights Incantation seven times. Draw in the qi of the Three Lights and exhale upon it three times. The swelling will naturally disperse. The same applies to injuries from poisonous snakes or creatures.\n\n**Method to Treat Red Eyes**\nFirst transform into spirit and make the mudra of your original master. Draw in the qi of the Two Lights and infuse it into water. Then shout once, make the Dipper Mudra, and recite the incantation:\n\n*Oṃ vajra riyaye □ḍa,\nYou are Li Gongzhong,\nWhy have you come to my home?\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\n\nRecite it three times, shout three times, and use the water to rinse the eyes.\n\n**Method to Suppress Malaria**\nFirst transform into the Star Officials Zhang and Yi—each a hundred feet tall, clad in green cloud-scarves, wielding jade tablets, dwelling in the south, and governing malaria ghosts. The ancestral name of the malaria ghost resembles that of the Black Grief ghost. Use the Dipper Mudra to write these six characters on paper money, then brush the patient three times before burning it outside the door. Visualize the petitioner as the Day Officer of Divine Merit for that day, face north to burn incense, and rewrite the names of the seven stars of the Dipper, having the patient swallow them. The illness will immediately cease. Also write the character \"general\" and bind it to the patient’s left middle finger for males or right for females. The master should press the character \"flower\" onto the talisman. Once the malaria ceases, burn the talisman with paper money outside the door. Boiling peach branches into a decoction and adding the Three Lights Talisman is especially effective. Visualize the Star Officials Zhang and Yi capturing and severing the ancestral name of the malaria ghost, which resembles the Black Grief ghost. Recite the incantation fourteen times.\n\n**Childbirth-Hastening Talisman (Also Effective Against Rats)**\nTake a cypress stick four inches long and three fingers wide. Place a brush at the Heavenly Gate, burn incense toward the broken phase, then stand with both feet together, first opening the front (called \"Opening the Heavenly Gate\") and then the back (called \"Closing the Earthly Door\"). Sit at the Xun position, facing Qian, and make the Mudras of the Pleiades and the Sun. Visualize yourself within the mouth of the Northern Dipper, drawing the true purple qi of the Star Giant Gate and channeling it down to infuse the brush. With one breath, inscribe the talisman. Hang it within the birthing chamber, but ensure the pregnant woman does not see it before labor, lest it disturb the fetus.\n\n**Talisman Design:**\nFor hastening childbirth, inscribe the talisman on a three-inch square of paper. Visualize the Four Commanders of the Four Directions—clenched fists, heads bound with black cloth, wearing crimson robes with wide sleeves—arraying demon-quelling thunder, lightning, and fire chariots. Bite down on the talisman, silently recite the incantation seven times:\n\n*Heaven and Earth unite,\nSun and Moon unite,\nHuman and ghost unite.*\n\nRecite this once with a single breath. Then visualize the talisman’s soldiers—thunder, lightning, and fire chariots—entering the abdomen with the talisman. Swallow it with freshly drawn water. For males, hold it in the left hand; for females, the right, and expel it from the hand.\n\n**Master Xu’s Incantation for Water to Treat Illness**\n*Southern Celestial Pivot,\nNorthern Dark Warrior,\nEastern Old Lord,\nWestern White Tiger,\nHeavenly Elder,\nEarthly Matriarch.\nDivine water of the Five Directions,\nDescend and manifest your register!*\n\nFirst recite the incantation ten thousand times; thereafter, seven times suffice. For all incantations, first make the Thunder Duke’s Mudra and recite it twenty-one times in one breath. Draw in the qi of the Five Directions and Heavenly Rigor, infusing it into the water. This method may be applied to all illnesses, yielding great merit. Using it alongside the Three Lights Talisman is especially efficacious.\n\n**Thunder Duke’s Mudra**\nRaise the left hand, clasp the right. Hook the left hand’s fourth finger around the right hand’s third finger. Press the right hand’s second finger onto the left hand’s fourth finger. Hook the left hand’s third finger around the right hand’s fourth finger. Press the back of the left hand’s fifth finger against the back of the right hand’s fourth finger at the middle joint. Hook the right hand’s fifth finger around the left hand’s fifth finger. The left thumb presses the middle joint of the left hand’s second finger, while the right thumb presses the Zi character.\n\n*Thus concludes the second scroll of* The Supreme Essential Secrets for Assisting the State and Saving the People.\n*Here begins the third scroll of* The Supreme Essential Secrets for Assisting the State and Saving the People.",

      "translated_text": "Master Dongyou’s Yuanmiao Zong Compilation:\n*Talismanic Methods for Dispelling Consumptive Wasting and All Diseases, Together with the Authentic Rites of Tianpeng for Beheading Demons*\n\n**On the Treatment of Consumptive Wasting**\n\nThe affliction of corpse-worms and transmitted ailments arises from the treatment of illness yet originates in indulgent desires. When indulgent desires remain unchecked, they lead to untimely demise. Though death may come early, if the celestial allotment of years has not yet expired, such deaths are deemed unjustly premature. Since the underworld has not yet summoned or constrained them, nor have they undergone karmic retribution, their ethereal souls linger in stagnation, unable to attain liberation. Thus, they transform into yin-demonic qi, infecting their kin through the bones. In most cases, they seek nothing more than to depend upon and draw from the qi of the living.\n\nThese worms consume a person’s essence and blood until emaciation sets in, spreading through the five viscera and causing unceasing convulsions. Often, entire clans are brought to ruin by this, a grievous sorrow indeed. In severe cases, neither medicinal remedies nor acupuncture can cure it. Even if Sangong were alive today or Hua Tuo reborn, how could they restore such patients?\n\nAlas, the people suffer innocently, unjustly drowned in calamity. Moved by compassion, Heaven has revealed the Daoist methods. As the scriptures state: *\"If the illness has not yet advanced deeply, and the joints remain unbreached, it may still be treated. But if the joints have already been passed, attempts at healing will prove futile. However, by applying this method, future afflictions may be averted.\"*\n\nFor those seeking deliverance, the afflicted household must provide a detailed written account, describing the patient’s initial onset of illness—its time, place, and cause—as well as any encounters with the deceased appearing in dreams, or connections to malevolent ghosts and demonic entities.\n\nIn performing these rites, sincerity and reverence are paramount. All ritual offerings, sacred gifts, and invocations of qi should be prepared according to one’s means, whether modest or generous. For impoverished households, the officiating master may provide the necessary items. Wealthier families should adhere to the prescribed rites and prepare the proper jiao offerings to repay Heaven’s grace.\n\nThe officiating master must guard against greed, never diverting ritual offerings for personal use. All received items should be dedicated to incense, scripture recitations, and the maintenance of sacred fires. Secondly, they should aid reclusive ascetics in the mountains and the destitute in the world. While adhering to proper protocols, one must not begrudge wealth or treat sacred arts with contempt, lest one profane the august sages and incur divine censure. The statutes are clear—this is a matter to be approached with utmost caution.\n\nBelow are the proven talismans, recorded in full:\n\n**Talisman for Severing Corpse-Infestation (to be ingested daily, with all forms of the talisman gathered in one scroll, written in cinnabar)**\n\n**Talisman for Slaying Transmitted-Wasting Worms and Annihilating Corpse-Demons**\nOnce the talisman is drawn, place it in a clean, plain vessel filled with pure water, setting it before the patient. Have another person hold the talisman and drop it into the water without disturbing it. If the talisman sinks within seven days, the wasting demons and corpse-worms will perish, and the illness will be instantly cured. If the talisman floats, recovery from the wasting disease will be delayed. This method is divinely efficacious and must not be transmitted to unworthy recipients.",

      "translated_text": "I now command your body to instantly become the Child Overseer of Birth. For me, transmit the talisman forth—swiftly part mother and child. Swiftly, swiftly, as the Supreme Emperor decrees.\n\nWhen inscribing the talisman with the incantation, envision the recipient as the Child Hastening Birth. As you dispatch the talisman, observe the person receiving it, using left or right hand to discern the child’s sex. If the talisman is to be swallowed, use flowing water while facing north. When dispatching the talisman, employ the Thunder Duke Mudra.\n\n**Fire Wheel Talisman**\nInscribe on a Fire Day at noon; if a Fire Day cannot be awaited, any yang day will suffice. Transform the spirit into the Heavenly Master. With the left hand, form the Golden Spear Mudra, face the sun, and intone the Perfected Sovereign of Boundless and Unfixed Limit. Toward the sun, inscribe one fire character with the Golden Spear, reciting the True Sovereign of Fiery Virtue and Blazing Deluder of the Southern Direction. Inscribe another fire character, reciting the All-Responsive True Sovereign of the Red Emperor. Inscribe yet another fire character, then recite the Three True Sovereigns once more. Draw three streams of solar fire qi through the nose into the heart.\n\n**Dispersed Form**\nQian, Kan,\nGen, Zhen,\nXun, Li,\nKun, Dui.\nOne True Sovereign,\nRecite Two True Sovereigns.\nWith each stroke, intone *Fire Wheel General of a Hundred*.\n\n**Assembled Form**\nInscribe in cinnabar on paper strips. When dispatching the talisman, recite the Three True Sovereigns, envisioning the sun and the fiery qi of the southern direction blazing intensely, pouring into the talisman.\n\n**Heavenly Penetrator Salvation Method**\nThe Heavenly Penetrator is a general under the Northern Emperor. The scripture states: The Heavenly Penetrator’s original form is the ninth star of the Northern Dipper, the transformed body of the Golden-Browed Lord, who subdues demons and rescues living beings without distinction of sex. All may venerate him. Always on the fifth and twenty-fifth days of the month—days when the Heavenly Penetrator Great Sage descends—prepare a bowl of pure water, a sword, an incense burner, and a table. Burn incense according to the method. White glue or a decoction of cypress may also be used. Offer cakes, fruits, and flowers as one wishes. On the Three Primordial Days, light the Seven Stars Lamp and present an altar array of flowers and fruits. When performing prohibitions, first clench the fists, close the eyes to visualize the spirit, knock the teeth together, and sound the Heavenly Drum three times. While visualizing with eyes closed, transform the five viscera and five qi into the Five Spirits: Green Dragon on the left, White Tiger on the right, Vermilion Bird in front, Dark Warrior behind, the Seven Stars within the head, and the Qilin beneath the feet. The Three Terraces take form, the Celestial Rigidity faces forward, the three demonic paths are traversed, the Subduing Demon Mudra is formed, and evil ghosts are vanquished. When invoking, first visualize the sun on the left and the moon on the right, the Northern Ultimate Great Emperor in a dark crown and feathered robes, and the Seven Stars True Sovereigns in vermilion garments with crimson sashes. Next, visualize within the Northern Dipper the Perfected Ones and Jade Maidens, the Three Primordial Generals and officers, descending from the void in response to their corporeal forms. Then visualize the Heavenly Penetrator, Great Sage of the Golden Head, eight-faced and eight-armed, fifty *zhang* in height, clad in golden armor, wielding a sword, halberd, imperial bell, and spirit seal, leading thirty thousand cavalry. Thunder Masters and Lightning Masters, immortal youths and jade maidens, their feathered banners resplendent, each brandishing a golden sword, descend from the void to stand before and behind. Only then burn incense and make the invocation. To recite the Heavenly Penetrator’s divine spell, first knock the teeth together thirty-six times, then press the Heavenly Penetrator’s Ghost-Subduing Eye, located on the second joint of the left middle finger. Having pressed it, recite the incantation:\n\nHeavenly Penetrator, Heavenly Penetrator,\nNine Primes’ Slaying Youth.\nFive Ding Commanders, Tall Blade Northern Elder.\nSeven Governances, Eight Numinous Ones,\nSupreme Lord’s Vast Ferocity.\nLong-Fanged Giant Beast,\nGrasping the Imperial Bell.\nWhite Owl of the Three Vehicles,\nMounting the Mighty Kui Dragon.\nMighty Sword Spirit King,\nSlaying evil, eradicating traces.\nPurple qi rides the sky,\nCinnabar radiance blazes forth.\nDevouring demons, consuming ghosts,\nBody transverse, drinking the wind.\nBlue tongue, green teeth,\nFour-eyed Elder Nie.\nHeavenly Ding Force-Soldiers,\nMight of the South repelling ferocity.\nHeavenly Couriers, fierce and wrathful,\nMight of the North bearing blades.\nThirty thousand troops,\nGuard my ninefold layers.\nExpel corpses a thousand *li*,\nDispel misfortune and avert calamity.\nShould any petty ghost\nDare approach to witness this,\nHeavenly Great Axe,\nSevering the five forms of ghosts.\nFiery Emperor’s scorching blood,\nNorthern Dipper’s burning bones.\nFour Luminaries shatter the skeleton,\nHeavenly Strategy annihilates the kind.\nOne stroke of the divine blade—\nTen thousand ghosts scatter in rout.\n\nWhen uttering the word “slay,” recite it habitually. If one fears harming ghosts and spirits, omit the word “slay.” After ten thousand recitations, merit is accomplished. Whenever reciting this incantation, tap the teeth once for every four words as a regular rhythm—this is the discipline of cultivating the true. If reciting day and night, one need not tap the teeth for every four words. In cases of ghostly affliction, sit upright according to the method, tap the teeth once for every four words, or first tap seven times, recite three times, then tap seven more times, and earnestly state one’s heartfelt vow. The haunting ghost will then suffer darkened, rotting eyes and perish. This incantation is the Northern Emperor’s secret. If a person of this world obtains this incantation and method and practices it regularly, they may control all evils, augment spirit and qi, prolong life, avert misfortune, cross tribulations, exorcise calamities, rescue and protect living beings, and prevent unjust harm. Men and women, young and old, may all practice it. Those who cultivate and recite must wholeheartedly focus, without mixing in other methods or heterodox defenses, nor sharing the same chamber—these are all the malign spirits of the Six Heavens. To profane the numinous and upright, or to mock and deride the divine spells as mere common text, will incur the Heavenly Penetrator’s resentment, causing one to go mad, throw oneself into water or fire, suffer prolonged torment in the grave, or bring cascading misfortune upon one’s family, extending calamity to seven generations. One cannot be too cautious—do not treat true secrets lightly.\n\n**Heavenly Penetrator’s Ghost-Pursuing Method and Talisman**\nWhen someone comes to request a ritual master, first draw three breaths of the person’s qi, step the Dipper, and ascend to the Dipper’s mouth. Then point to the *chou* earthly branch of the Dipper, and from *wei* dispatch the command. Visualize the Dipper’s mouth covering the head, the Dipper’s handle pointing forward. Upon exiting the door, visualize a Heavenly Official! Issue the command to go forth first, then from *chen* dispatch the Heavenly Troops, and from *wu* dispatch the Earthly Troops.",

      "translated_text": "During the Great Tang, on Mount Magu—so named because the immortal Magu attained Dao there—there lived a man surnamed Zheng, styled Ziyang, who burned incense and studied the Daoist canon. On this mountain, he practiced the arts of Fengdu, dwelling in its grottoes for five years. Day and night he cultivated without the slightest slackening, reciting the Heavenly Penetrator’s divine incantations without pause. One night of the Upper Prime, the sky was serene, the moon bright as day. Ziyang burned incense and made his petition, praying for the descent of true numina. As he recited as before, suddenly a book descended from heaven—white silk inscribed in black characters, radiant with several beams of light—flying into his chamber before vanishing in an instant. Ziyang sighed in wonder, unable to fathom its depths. Resolving his intent, he sat upon a flat stone, closed his eyes, and as if in slumber, beheld a divine figure clad in armor, bearing a sword, who addressed him: “I am the Messenger of the Six *Ding* of the Northern Heaven. By the Celestial Emperor’s decree, I bestow upon you thirty-six talismans of the Black Script, two characters within them forbidden for use, all recorded herein.”\n\nThe Heavenly Penetrator’s Thirty-Six Talismans are now rarely practiced. Though the texts exist in the world, most appear as thirty-six isolated characters, lacking the secret art of their assembled forms. I once received these texts along with their composite forms, distinct from those in common circulation. When applied, they manifest extraordinary efficacy, and I have thus recorded them with care.\n\n**Heavenly Canopy**\nThis is the true talisman of the Heavenly Penetrator, Great Marshal of the Primordial. Envision the Five Stars descending azure *qi* to infuse the brush. Conjure the first star of the Northern Dipper to inscribe the talisman, shattering demonic shrines and restraining all fierce and violent ghosts and spirits. It subdues lingering corpse-qi, malevolent essences, and the ailments of yin-yang perversion. If inscribed with utmost sincerity, swallowed, or worn, a thousand ghosts and ten thousand specters shall be obliterated upon sight.\n\n**Ninefold Prime Slays the Youth**\nThis is the talisman of the Great General of Heavenly Slaughter. Envision the sixth star of the Northern Dipper descending black *qi* to infuse the brush and form the talisman. It dispels demonic afflictions, illnesses, madness, and wandering winds.

Envision the fifth star of the Northern Dipper descending purple-black *qi* to infuse the brush and form the talisman. It can subdue malaria ghosts and the five types of epilepsy. Simply inscribe, swallow, or wear the talisman, and the ailment shall vanish at once.\n\n**Tall Blade, Northern Elder**\nThis is the talisman of the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper. Envision the seventh star of the Northern Dipper descending yellow *qi* to infuse the brush and form the talisman.

Envision the third star of the Northern Dipper descending yellow *qi* to infuse the brush and form the talisman. The wearer shall not be harassed by evil demons; those with malicious intent shall all submit and be unable to cause harm. Instead, they shall incur misfortune, grievances shall be forever dispelled, and no trials shall befall.\n\n**Majestic Presence: *Kuilong***\nThis spirit constantly serves in the presence of the Jade Emperor; it cannot be commanded in the mortal realm.

If the weather is rainless, point toward river pools, deep ponds, or lakes, and separately state the circumstances in a petition to the Ancestral Master, the *Shangqing Great Emperor*, and the *Jade Sovereign of the Vast Heaven*, humbly beseeching a special decree to command the officials of the designated river source to await the talisman’s arrival and immediately provide relief by bestowing rain, dispersing it across the specified area with a fixed depth of [X] *chi*. *\"Humbly beseech your assent to this minister’s petition for implementation.\"*\n\nAdditionally, file a report to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water; address a writ to the *Thunder, Rain, and Lightning Department*, the *Tianding* warriors, the *Rain-Dragon Kings*, the *Wind Earl*, and the *Rain Masters*. Clearly describe the circumstances in the memorial and attach an official note to the designated area, instructing all water-bearing locations to await the talisman’s arrival for verification and immediate action. Conduct a Daoist ritual for three days, or five days.\n\nAfter concluding the memorials, when others have withdrawn, take one *liang* of cinnabar, grind it finely according to the day, and prepare a clean brush and an iron plate one *chi* two *cun* long and four *cun* wide. Follow the method of pacing the Dipper’s net to gather *qi*, then reverse the Dipper’s steps and stand facing the lunar station. Write in cinnabar without additions or omissions. Seal the completed talisman in yellow silk and stamp it with the *Dutian Fazu* seal, including the full official title and signature without revealing the name.\n\nWrite a separate directive, clench the *Tianding Mudra*, and recite the *Transformation Spirit Mantra*. Then summon the *Tianding* warriors: *\"For [location], long deprived of rain, I have submitted a memorial. Now I designate [specific lake or pond; if others, point as needed]. Rain must descend. I hereby dispatch you to accompany this talisman to [location] and urgently coordinate with the Rain-Dragon Department to deliver rain at [specific day and hour], without delay.\"* After inscribing the talisman, read it aloud, issue the command, and cast it into the water.

Each talisman is inscribed and the prison established according to the dominant phase of the season, enabling interrogation, expulsion, and verification of responses.\n\n**Earth Prison Talisman**\nInscribe in cinnabar on yellow paper, first affixing it within the prison with a nail, then spreading ash.\nWhen creating the Earth Prison Talisman, first visualize the talisman envoy: his forehead smeared with crimson, head wrapped in a black cloth, clad in vermilion robes, wielding an iron rod, descending from the void. Next, envision the brush as a yellow dragon, its mouth emitting luminous *qi* to form the talisman.\nBefore setting brush to paper, recite the incantation seven times, then recite the name of the Earth Star seven times.\nUpon completing the talisman, recite the Earth Star’s name thrice and the \"Three Bindings\" seven times.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*Om □ ra bō sǒng nà yě yě dà tuó ā niè dì líng tí dì hǔ luō ěr yā tí ōm yī hǎi lóu hǎi shā shā pó hē.* Draw *qi*.\n\n**Earth Star’s Name:** *Junzhali.*\nThis is the secret name of the Earth Star.\n\n**Three Bindings.**\nRecite these two characters when completing the talisman.\n\n**Wood Prison Talisman**\nInscribe in cinnabar on blue-green paper, place within the prison, then spread ash.\nWhen creating the Wood Prison Talisman, visualize the Year Star arriving from the east, descending and transforming into blue-green *qi*, which pours into the crown of the head. Envision yourself wearing a star-crowned headdress, clad in blue-green robes and vermilion shoes, holding a blue-green jade tablet in the left hand while inscribing the talisman with the right. Imagine the brush as a blue-green dragon, its mouth emitting luminous *qi* to form the talisman.\nBefore setting brush to paper, recite the incantation seven times:\n- For the character \"太上治书,\" recite: *\"By the decree of the Most High Lord Lao,\"* draw *qi* and blow.\n- For the character \"七统,\" recite: *\"By the decree of the Seven Stars,\"* draw *qi* and blow.\n- For the character \"煞鬼,\" recite: *\"Heavenly Slayer, Earthly Slayer, Year Slayer, Month Slayer, Day Slayer, Hour Slayer.\"* Draw the *qi* of celestial rigidity and blow, each seven times.\n- For \"急召,\" recite: *\"Hasten!

Suddenly, your form transforms into the Great White Star, crowned and clad in white. Left hand forms the \"Pursuing Ghost\" mudra, right hand inscribes the talisman. Envision the brush as a white dragon, its mouth emitting luminous *qi* to form the talisman.\nBefore setting brush to paper, recite the incantation seven times.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"Great White, luminous and pure, captures and seizes the iniquitous.\nGhosts of improper alignment—heaven and earth reject them.\nThe Metal Tiger displays its might, crushing the demonic vanguard.\nAll hidden evils—divine officers pursue them to the end!\"*\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\n\nUpon completing the talisman, recite: *\"By the white numinous *qi* of the West, seize them!\"* Seven times, draw *qi*.\n\nTo establish these five prisons, first place the talisman at the center, then pace the Twenty-Eight Constellations in reverse, following the *Ding* guideline as you encircle it. When raising such a prison, also inscribe this talisman, burn it, and have the afflicted person ingest it, adhering to the Five Phases’ numerical sequence: one for Water, two for Fire.\n\n**Method for Establishing the Five Prisons**\nWhen constructing the Five Prisons, submit memorials and documents in accordance with the *Celestial Heart* method and the *Celestial Prison* protocol, employing the same directional alignments as before.\nEach prison should be circular, thirty-six inches in diameter. Place the talisman at the prison’s center, then spread fine ash atop it to a depth of two *fen*.\nFor the **Water Prison**, use a new, unblemished basin of three *dou* capacity, free from leaks, filled seven-tenths with pure water.

All relevant divine officers are hereby notified and charged with this duty, to facilitate their subsequent transfer.\n\nThis notice is hereby issued to all marshaled divine generals, chief magistrates, officers, and soldiers for their information and compliance.\nIn the year of [Tai Sui], [month], [day], [hour]\nProclamation.\nSealed by the Ritual Master [half of the name withheld].\n\n**Diagram of the Prison Layout**\nAfter constructing the prison, burn the talisman for summoning ghosts (as per the *Celestial Prison* protocol).\n\n**Invocation upon Completing the Prison**\nOnce the prison is established, burn incense, transform into the divine form, and pace the Seven Stars of the Dipper, as previously instructed. State the purpose of the prison’s construction, execute the *Duhjian* mudra, silently summon the City God, and entreat the household’s Controller of Destiny, the Five Paths Earth Deities, and the neighboring altar and temple spirits. Clearly command the divine generals, officers, and soldiers to enforce the deadline, ensuring the malevolent ghosts are apprehended within the allotted time, brought to the prison to manifest their traces, and render clear retribution. This will facilitate their transfer; any negligence or disobedience will result in all relevant deities being reported to Mount Tai for investigation, with those complicit subjected to judgment. This decree is hereby issued for implementation.\n\nThe prison’s invocation is identical to the *Celestial Prison* incantation. The method for verifying ghostly traces within the prison follows the same protocol. If no retribution is observed after two days, resubmit the writ and urge compliance.\n\n**Talisman for Summoning Mountain Spirits and Wild Specters**\nInscribe this talisman in cinnabar. Execute the *Xuanwu* mudra, visualizing oneself as the True Warrior, hair unbound, wielding a fire bell of samādhi and a divine sword, treading upon the tortoise and serpent. Execute the *Tianding* mudra, summoning the Celestial Ding Warriors, the Four Duty Gods, and the divine generals, visualizing them at one’s side.\n\nFirst, execute the mudra, cast the Dipper, and with the Dipper’s handle pointing ahead, direct it toward the location of the spirits. Then approach the altar and recite the incantation:\n*\"I bear the seal of the Most High; hasten to this place. Deploy the divine qi, sever ghosts, and expel demons. Four Duty Messengers, Six Ding and Six Jia, I urgently summon you—speed to this altar. Here I stand, sword planted, awaiting you. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"*\n\nUpon completing the incantation, visualize the Six Jia, Six Ding, Four Duty Gods, talismanic envoys, and divine soldiers fanning out to search and drive the spirits beneath the altar.\n\nInscribe the talisman in cinnabar.\n*Disperse the forms.*",

He envisions two youths wielding swords and holding seals, with the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior stationed before, behind, left, and right. The radiance of the sun and moon illumines his eyes, the Five Stars crown his head, and the *qi* of blue, yellow, and white swirls about his body. A nine-colored halo emanates from behind his neck, penetrating both within and without, until he beholds the Supreme Lord Tang of the Upper Primordial standing before him, holding a talisman. To his left, Lord Ge of the Middle Primordial stands with a halberd; to his right, Lord Zhou of the Lower Primordial holds a staff. At the center, the Directing Attendant and Merit Clerk, with messengers to left and right, and Golden Lads and Jade Maidens attend. The officials, divine generals, and spirit marshals of the memorial’s retinue, the deities and officers of the register and ritual, and the Vajra-Powered Warriors array themselves in encircling ranks.\n\nNext, he visualizes himself ascending in a cinnabar-jade chariot, borne upon crimson clouds from the northwest. First, he enters the realm of the *Gang* Wind, where sun and moon intertwine in brilliance, the Yellow Path stretches smooth and straight, and he passes through five-colored clouds to reach the Heavenly Gate. Traversing the Desire Realm and the Formless Realm, he crosses the Heaven of the Seed People, where seven-jeweled jade groves line the path, their branches stirred by numinous winds to produce celestial harmonies. Beyond the Yellow Path, a purple cloud forms a canopy, and in the distance, the gates of the Golden Palace appear, inscribed with *Taiqing* and *Taiji*. One hundred paces from the gates, he dismounts, leaving his guardian officers and generals behind. Only the Jade Maiden of the Decade and the Jade Lad bearing the memorial, carrying the memorial case, accompany him as he hastens forward into the palace gates.\n\nHe enters the second enclosure of the Golden Palace, inscribed *Gate of the Three Heavens of the Supreme Lord*, but does not proceed through this gate. Instead, he turns west and descends to the *Taiyuan* Capital Gate. North of the gate lies the Heavenly Pivot Court, where he beholds the Great Hall. There, he pays homage to Celestial Master Zhang of the Orthodox Unity and prostrates to present the cause of his memorial. The Celestial Master approves, then exits the hall’s eastern gate, turns north, and proceeds to the Phoenix Tower. After a brief interval, a Jade Lad in vermilion robes and black cap emerges from the gate, takes the memorial case from the hands of the memorial-bearing Jade Lad, and enters to present it before the Supreme Lord.\n\nNext, a Leading Immortal Attendant guides the audience. The Supreme Lord wears a crown of Nine Virtues and a robe of nine-colored cloud and mist, seated upon the central dais. Two Perfected Ones stand in attendance to his left and right, with hosts of immortals in escort. The Grand Unity, clad in vermilion, stands before the Supreme Lord to review the memorial’s text, then privately conveys its intent. The Supreme Lord commands the Grand Unity to inscribe the response beneath the Jade Stairs of the *Taiqing* Palace. Upon the right steps of the Jade Hall, the memorial is entrusted to the duty officers of the day, and the ritual concludes with obeisance.\n\nThe Supreme Lord then dismisses the Celestial Master, who rejoins the officials and officers at the gate, exulting as they return to the chariot. Retracing the path of their initial procession, they arrive before the altar.

Pledges, contracts, and instruments of trust, such as gold and silver, shall be melted down and sold, the proceeds used for offerings and to aid the poor; they shall not be appropriated for personal use, or the offender shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.\n\nFor ritual officers who pass away suddenly, if they have foretold their departure with extraordinary signs, this is a mandate from heaven, and they shall depart abruptly. If no such signs appear, the authorities shall investigate, and if the circumstances are unclear, the heir to their teachings or their kin shall promptly burn the talismans, edicts, ordination certificates, and ritual robes of their master, as well as the documents and robes of their own rank, casting the ashes into the Yangtze River for the Water Officials to convey to the underworld; violators shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude.\n\nFor ritual officers whose merit and conduct are complete and who are summoned by heaven, their bodies shall move twice upward and thrice downward, like the motion of serpents or insects, accompanied by a sound like the wind. Their eyes shall lack divine radiance, the Celestial Pillar shall not rise, the Heavenly Drum shall not sound, and their Kidney Hall shall ache. Their spirit and *qi* shall surge from the Bubbling Spring point to the Crown Gate. They shall then gather their edicts, registers, talismans, seals, and containers in one place, don fresh ritual robes, sit upright, and leave final instructions to their heirs. Before their transformation, auspicious clouds and immortal retinues shall arrive to escort them directly to their grotto-heaven, where they shall receive immortal office and assume their duties. If their body shows signs of failing but they are unable to sustain themselves, the local earth deity shall assist their heirs in sealing the documents as described above; violators shall be exiled three thousand *li*. For grave offenses, the punishment shall be death.\n\n**Articles 35–39:**\nAll orthodox demon statutes, talismans, and registers shall be stored in fragrant boxes, embroidered bags, or bamboo containers. When inspecting them, one shall enter stillness with eyes closed, establish a ritual boundary, and only then open the scrolls, reading no more than five lines at a time. They shall be kept secret and never allowed to be stolen or seen by ghosts and spirits.\n\nFor virtuous commoners who truly drive away evil and assist the upright, demonstrating merit in aiding others, their names shall be recorded and submitted, and they shall be transmitted orthodox teachings, appointed to office, and granted rank.\n\nAll ritual implements of the institute—such as swords, seals, brushes, ink, cinnabar, inkstones, crowns, shoes, and ritual water—shall not be privately used without prior submission and consecration.\n\nFor disciples seeking transmission, they shall approach their master with measured steps.",

      "translated_text": "The master ascends the altar to expound the precepts, performs the rites of blood-oath and cinnabar-drinking, divides the ring and breaks the contract, swearing solemn vows. Next, he imparts the esoteric hand seals and talismanic texts, declares the true instructions, and kneeling, the disciple receives the official rank, seals, swords, and the like. The master petitions the Perfected Ones above, expelling the Three Worms from the four limbs, absolving the myriad sins of the Nine Mysteries, and reports the disciple’s conduct to the appropriate authorities, aligning with the celestial will.\n\nAll divine generals, officers, and soldiers—those dispatched by the Eastern Peak—shall, upon arriving at the institute, be received with wine, food, spirit money, and paper horses as offerings. They shall remain steadfast in their duties, prepared for summoning and use, and must not be privately employed.\n\nWhen ritual officers pass by places with spirit shrines, they shall form the *Tian Ding* hand seal, sound the celestial drum, and summon the divine officials and guardian generals within their bodies to accompany them, thus displaying their majesty, so that spirits naturally submit in awe.\n\nRitual officers shall don their robes at dawn, harnessing the vital *qi* for their work. When submitting memorials or conducting jiao rites, they must not burn sandalwood or frankincense.\n\nAll human lifespans are ordained by Heaven, with destiny and longevity fixed. If, after the institute’s efforts to save them, the afflicted still do not recover, it is because their allotted span has ended and their karmic cycle is complete; in such cases, no further talismanic texts may be employed, for it would be in vain.\n\nWhen aiding the world’s people, the documents dispatched must not be overly elaborate; only sincere and direct matters may be stated. Moreover, one must explicitly declare that the person’s life is under celestial jurisdiction, that their fate and lifespan are being contested, and that the petition does not fall within the scope of the current appeal, thus seeking a clear response.\n\nWhen receiving complaints about maddened demons or malevolent spirits, the ritual officer transforms into a divine form, accepts the petition, seals it, and dispatches the spirits accordingly.\n\nFor jiao rites, memorials to the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor may be submitted, but these must not be offered frivolously at improper times. When burning memorials, they shall first be consecrated with a pledge token and sent by the dispatched *Gong Cao* and *Zhi Fu* spirits.\n\nWhen conducting jiao rites before the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor, a single *Cai Fang* emissary may be positioned beside them; no other deities may approach the imperial seat.\n\nWhen entering stillness to burn incense, perform rituals, or transcribe texts from the esoteric tradition, one must first cover the Dipper, and must not allow one’s gaze to wander.\n\nFor those who have been wronged unto death and return to cry for vengeance, they shall be suppressed with the Dipper’s cover.\n\nWhen treating cattle, horses, and other livestock afflicted by pestilence, inquire after the number of losses and submit a document to the Year-Star deity to drive away the plague.\n\nWhen accepting offerings of faith, assess the sincerity of the giver; the monetary value shall be divided into three parts: one for use, one for offerings, and one for alms to the poor, thus sustaining the Dao.\n\nWhen establishing a prison to treat illnesses or dispatching talismanic texts, those who resist shall be seized and tried as prisoners.\n\nFor those possessed or tormented by nightmares, with depleted heart and kidney *qi*, talismans shall be swallowed or worn to suppress the affliction.\n\nWhen treating children suffering from night terrors or nocturnal crying, entrust the case to the Household Deity, the Eaves Spirit, the Four Heavenly Kings, the Flying Celestials, and the Swift Spirits, using the Three Lights talisman for healing.\n\nRitual officers who daily save the world’s people shall use the funds for sustaining the Dao, accepting no bribes from the people. Heaven will naturally bestow blessings; if resources are lacking, memorials may be submitted, for sincerity will be met with unseen aid, and no want shall remain. If one accepts bribes, worldly support will not endure.\n\nFor households whose hearths or businesses are afflicted by malevolent hexes, employ the Three Lights talisman to dispatch spirits for treatment.\n\nWhen undertaking construction or repairs, submit a document to the Year-Star deity to pacify the local Earth God and other spirits, preventing them from causing harm.\n\nFor strange anomalies residing in ponds, embankments, or dikes that cause frequent damage or untimely destruction, entrust the local Earth God to drive them away, and suppress them with the Three Lights talisman. Those who refuse to leave shall be punished and expelled according to the law.\n\nWhen epidemics spread and people suffer from illness, in addition to submitting documents to the local Earth God, a petition shall be sent to the Year-Star deity to withdraw the toxic *qi*. If a memorial must be flown to Heaven, the institute’s officer shall perform the *Yu Bu* step, transform into a divine form, and silently recite the oral memorial to make it known.\n\nFor childless commoners, whether due to barrenness or poverty, first use ritual methods to repel the Three Punishments and Six Harms stars, then have them wear the register.\n\nFor those whose dwellings are inauspicious, with disharmony between yin and yang, mutual clashes, and years of hardship, bestow upon them the Orthodox Register.\n\nWhen performing rituals, gauge the severity of the matter and act accordingly; do not recklessly mobilize divine generals, officers, or soldiers. When receiving and sealing petitions, dispatch them promptly, and do not implicate the spirits in wrongdoing.\n\nWhen transmitting orthodox teachings, conduct a jiao rite on an auspicious day within the esoteric tradition, called the Transmission Jiao. Offer 120 portions of spirit money and paper horses as ceremonial gifts. For the Middle Sage’s position, the offerings shall be half the number. The memorialist shall comply, reporting to Heaven and Earth. After the officiating officer submits a letter of guarantee, the esoteric hand seals, talismans, official decrees, and true registers shall be conferred, and a report shall be sent to the Eastern Peak to transfer the name from the underworld’s ledgers to the celestial records. Thus, the nine generations shall be pardoned, liberated from the dark realms, and ascend to the realm of the living. The sequence of rites upon the altar shall follow the prescribed method.\n\nWhen ritual officers of the Demon-Quelling Institute perform their duties, they shall be titled *Du Da*, overseeing all demonic matters across the Three Realms. The initial appointment is as Right Vice Magistrate, followed by Right Magistrate, then Left Vice Magistrate, then Left Magistrate—all of whom jointly administer the institute’s affairs. Those with exceptional merit shall ascend to the immortal ranks and be appointed as *Du Tian Da Fa Zhu*, jointly administering the institute’s affairs. Next, they may be promoted to *Jiu Tian Jin Que Da Fu* for saving twenty people within a year, or for swiftly answering prayers during famines, droughts, or floods. Further ranks include Minister of the Water Department, Minister of the Wood Department, Minister of the Earth Department, Minister of the Metal Department, and Minister of the Fire Department—each awarded based on the number of people saved annually, exceeding twenty. Those who perform exceptionally in averting great disasters shall be promoted accordingly. Finally, they may be appointed as *Zi Wei Gong Shi Ri Zhi Yuan Jun*.",

Further, those who within a year drive away or eradicate locust plagues and monstrous calamities from the designated celestial regions, employing ritual methods to remove them, shall be elevated to *Jiu Tian Jin Que Yu Shi*. In the following year, should they vow to establish altars upon renowned mountains, submit petitions, and present memorials to pray for the sovereign’s longevity—with verifiable efficacy—they shall be advanced to *Jin Que Shang Xian Shi Zhong*. In another year, if they attain self-realization of their nature and essence, transcending the mundane, and guide the deluded masses to escape the Five Sufferings, personally journeying to the Southern Bureau to register their merits—ensuring sagely rulers, virtuous ministers, the salvation of their nine clans, and the benefaction of all beings—they shall be promoted to *Zi Fu Shang Xiang*, followed by *Xuan Du Da Xiang*, *Tai Xuan Shang Xiang*, *Tai Ji Shang Xiang*, and *Jin Que Shang Xiang*. In yet another year, if they fully comprehend the boundless Dao, free from attachment to written words, and through direct instruction achieve tangible results—such as quelling the harm caused by dragons in rivers, lakes, and seas, or averting landslides and floods—demonstrating true merit in benefiting the state and relieving the people while eradicating great malevolence, they shall be elevated to *Wu Ji Shang Xiang*.\n\nFrom *Ri Zhi Yuan Jun* to *Wu Ji Shang Xiang*, encompassing nine ranks of promotion, one shall be conferred the *Shang Qing Jiu Deng Da Lu* before being permitted to enter this system of advancement. Other positions follow the hierarchy of the immortal officials, with the Three Primes as the foremost. For those of the *Dong Shen* rank and below, progression begins with the *Chu Xia Yuan Yi Pin Xian Guan*. Next is the *Zhi Bei Ji Qu Xie Yuan Shi Zhong Yuan Yi Pin Xian Guan*, who oversees the Northern Pole Exorcism Institute. Following is the *Shang Yuan Yi Pin Xian Guan*, who governs the Fengdu Bureau. Those who fulfill their merit and karmic fruition shall ascend in sequence, attaining the Golden Gates and standing in attendance beside the Three Pure Ones.\n\nAll officials tasked with issuing the talismans of the Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor, the Northern Dipper, and the Three Luminaries shall transform their spirits and submit memorials, stating their requests and declaring themselves as subjects. In accordance with the prescribed formula, the petition shall be dispatched with the prayer: \"May it be as this subject has declared.\" Upon concluding the invocation, the talisman-bearing messenger shall be immediately dispatched, and upon its arrival, the decree shall be executed.\n\nAll ritual officers, when entering or exiting, shall constantly visualize the Six Ding, the Four Straight-Land Deities, and the Guardian Warriors following them. They shall command these spirits by ritual, ensuring no mishaps occur. When ritual officers ascend to the presence of the Supreme Emperor, exorcise pestilential spirits, or sever demonic influences, they must first don the Northern Dipper’s Three Terraces and transform into the Exorcism Institute’s Envoys. When paying homage to the Supreme Emperor, they shall ascend the Golden Hall on the first day of the new year, the Lapis Lazuli Hall in spring, the Precious Pearl Hall in summer, the Silver Hall in autumn, and the Crystal Hall in winter.\n\nAfter completing their memorials to the Supreme Emperor, they shall proceed to the Celestial Pivot Institute to command the Four Heavenly Kings, the Twelve Great Deities, the Eight Vajras, the Six Ding and Six Jia, the Marshals Tian Peng and Tian You, the Fire Bell Generals, the Five Thunder and Wind-Rain Gods, and exit through the Celestial Gate. When establishing prisons, they must memorialize and report to Mount Tai, detailing the circumstances and stating: \"On such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month, a celestial prison was established in such-and-such a direction.\" They shall memorialize the Supreme Emperor, designating it as the Five Dipper Prison.\n\n**Eight Regulations**\n\nAll celestial talismans and registers shall be inscribed with the brush of the Six Jia and Six Ding, using the ink of the Black Emperor, the cinnabar of the Solar Numinosity, and the inkstone of the Five Dragons, strictly adhering to the transmission and empowerment methods before use. When subduing fierce ghosts and spirits, it is essential to deploy the divine generals with meticulous care, employing the left and right exorcism incantations of the Dipper’s canopy. The practitioner shall then proclaim: \"I record your transgressions and pardon you, for my heart is set on saving the people.\"\n\nWhen conducting rites to beseech blessings and avert disasters for the people, one shall first memorialize the Star Host True Lords, then sit and declare: \"Disciple [Name] performs this rite to avert calamity, accumulate blessings, prolong life, and dispel misfortune, ensuring prosperity and longevity. With utmost sincerity, I prepare these offerings, humbly beseeching your divine perception and response to my devotion.\"\n\nWhen reciting the *Shang Qing* Dipper-Stepping Incantation, upon reaching the \"Celestial Rigidity\" step, one shall flick the seal mudra and then point with the Celestial Rigidity Seal. If reciting incantations within talismans, one shall step the Dipper beginning with the Star of Greed and Wolf.\n\nWhen offering sacrifices to the gods, one shall do so on the seasonal days of the Six Jia and other designated dates. In spring, the Six Jia days; in summer, the Six Bing days; in autumn, the Six Geng days; and in winter, the Six Gui days. Outside the gates, one shall present three portions of vegetarian fruits, dates, and fragrant tea to honor the Three Realms. The Straight Talisman and Four Straight Merit Officers shall first transform the spirit money for the local earth god, then state: \"By the decree of the Jade Emperor, I assist in the transformation of heaven, aid the state, and save the people. In all talismanic rituals to sever demonic influences, cure illnesses, rescue the perilous, bestow blessings, and invoke auspiciousness, I rely on you, the messengers, to communicate with the myriad sagely hosts above and below. Today, I have prepared wine, fruits, spirit money, and horses as offerings for this rite. I humbly beseech your benevolence, manifest your majestic radiance, and bestow your divine protection.\"\n\nNext, one shall pour three libations of wine, burn the spirit money, and recite the incantation.\n\n**Oath to the Merit Officers**\n\n\"I have heard that those who cultivate the great Dao in former lives now become supreme spirits, with merit and conduct as their foremost priority and the salvation of the people as their urgent task. Thus, they manifest in the unseen and respond in the netherworld, emerging from water and entering fire, assuming myriad forms with boundless efficacy. Clad in armor, bearing drums and bells, they traverse freely without obstruction. At their presence, evil demons tremble in fear, and the afflicted find peace. I wield the orthodox Dharma to subdue demons, relying on your divine might to assist in capturing and subduing malevolent spirits, severing the roots of calamity, bestowing blessings upon the virtuous, and ensuring merit returns to the path of goodness. Today, with this sacrificial offering, I modestly repay your divine merit, slightly expressing gratitude for your toils, and reciprocating your numinous power. I deeply appreciate your strenuous efforts and humbly invite you all to feast to your fill.\"\n\n**Oath to the Divine Generals**\n\n\"You shall all feast to your fill on wine and food, then compose yourselves with solemn dignity, uphold the celestial precepts, reverently execute the Emperor’s commands, wield the authority of martial prowess, and achieve the merit of pacification. With your illustrious achievements, may your resounding response be clear. I now invoke the divine generals and soldiers dispatched by the Eastern Peak, who possess hidden martial prowess, innate strategic acumen, awe-inspiring reputations, and majestic virtue. Hear my call!\"",

You aid the state and succor the people, benefiting the times and sustaining all beings. With wholehearted devotion to the Dao, none surpass your merit. Having early received the immortal’s decree and long been sheltered by the Dao’s grace, I have presumptuously assumed the authority of a celestial officer, relying solely on the protection of the supreme deities. Above, I guard my person and preserve my life, cultivating the Dao and serving Heaven, drawing upon my innate truth to aspire to celestial rank. In the middle, I propagate the sagely transformation and manifest hidden merits, extending this numinous power to fulfill my aspirations. Below, I rescue people and benefit beings, curing illnesses and expelling evil, exterminating malevolent spirits and fostering prosperity, striving to accumulate good effects and resonant responses, making subtle virtues manifest. You shall share in these benefits; when merit is achieved, you shall together enjoy its glory. Together, we shall advance the conveniences of this world and collectively uphold the supremacy of the true Dharma. Benefit without harm, awe with just punishment. For all matters that deviate from the mean or violate harmony, harm beings or defy Heaven, execute punitive measures and carry out executions, eradicating evil and aiding the upright, thereby completing merit and overcoming malevolent power, triumphing through divine transformation over treacherous schemes. How could I, a mere mortal, withstand such trials? Who could resist? Only with your divine assistance can I uphold the great Dao. *Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\nTo all divine generals, officers, and soldiers: by this Dharma decree, I entrust and charge you to constantly guard and uphold the true Dharma, as proclaimed in this notice to the Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute.\n\nThe divine generals, officers, and soldiers currently under the jurisdiction of the Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute have been dispatched by the Jade Emperor’s edict to this institute to protect the Dharma, propagate transformation, assist the state, succor the people, and guide all beings toward the true Dao. It is feared that you may not be aware: this institute possesses the Heavenly Seal, measuring either one inch and eight fen, two inches and one fen, three inches, or five inches square. It commands hundreds of thousands of billions of celestial soldiers. Every stroke and line of the seal’s script conceals thirty-six myriad beings. The seal’s soldiers and generals turn at my command; evil demons hear of it and their gall shatters, the sick see it and find peace. Bestowed by the Supreme Emperor, borne by mighty warriors, the seal’s soldiers—hundreds of thousands of billions—come and go like the wind, formless and traceless, infinitely transformative, hidden within the seal. Summoned, they arrive; some appear as colossal figures filling the void, heads bearing Mount Sumeru, shoulders supporting the sun and moon, hands grasping the Emperor’s bell, feet treading *kui* dragons. Others manifest as minute forms entering a speck of dust, revealing vast numinous power within a hair’s breadth, upholding the true Dharma, endlessly transforming to rescue sentient beings, never boasting of their merit. Their wondrous power and the Dao’s methods are boundless.\n\nIt is feared that the divine generals, officers, and soldiers under your command may, in ignorance of these decrees, willfully disobey and incur punishment. Do not slight this institute. Now, the celestial soldiers and generals, as well as the Eastern Peak’s soldiers and generals, are to be divided into rotating shifts, prepared for urgent summons. Upon hearing this institute’s call, you must hasten to arrive. If not on duty or unsummoned, you are to remain concealed within the Six Directions, hidden and lying low.\n\n**Detailed Roster:**\n\n1. Celestial soldiers, generals, and officers must always be prepared for summons. If unsummoned, they may not leave the celestial realm without authorization.\n   - Southern Dipper celestial soldiers: 3,600\n   - Black *Sha* divine soldiers: 50,000\n   - Soldiers and generals of the Four Wheels, Orthodox First Division\n   - Soldiers and generals of the Radiant Light Division\n   - Celestial *Ding* deities\n   - Mighty warriors\n   - *Vajra* deities\n   - Radiant deities\n   - Flying Dragon cavalry officers: 1,000\n   - Dragon-Slaying cavalry officers: 1,000\n   - Dragon-Severing cavalry officers: 1,000\n   - Generals assisting the Dharma: 2\n\n2. Soldiers and generals dispatched by Mount Tai are to be divided into two shifts, alternating daily. They shall accompany the institute’s ritual officers in their comings and goings; in urgent matters, this does not apply. They may only station at this institute and must not act with negligence. The generals assisting the Dharma are to be constantly supervised.\n   - Commanding general: 1\n   - General assisting the Dharma: 1\n   - Infantry and cavalry: unspecified number\n   - Personnel arriving from the Eastern Peak Pass\n\nThe above-listed soldiers, generals, and divine officers are hereby notified. You are to carefully follow the preceding directives and comply accordingly. Any violation will not be lightly forgiven. For those who render merit, rewards and commendations shall be given, with petitions submitted to the celestial realm to bestow blessings.

      "translated_text": "The Methods of Aiding the Upright and Exorcising Evil through Summoning originate from the Orthodox Unity Dao, hence there are registers for the Three and Five Summoning Methods. The officers, generals, clerks, and soldiers are all recorded in the original texts. According to the *Golden Lock Flowing Pearls*, those who practice the summoning arts must receive the root scriptures and registers from an enlightened master. These include the Generals of the Three Origins and Five Phases, the Six Jia and Seven Stars, and the Jade Maidens’ scriptures and diagrams.\n\nSummoning, in essence, involves the examination of ghosts and the calling of spirits. One must resolve to assist the state and pacify the realm, healing and delivering the common people. Those who receive the true methods of summoning are akin to celestial officials, comparable to the governors of great commanderies. Their sacred duties are not to be taken lightly: every hundred days, they must perform a thought-patrol, inspecting the world for malevolent spirits, ghosts, and demonic influences, ensuring they do not cause harm. Every ten days, they must engage in thought-application, visualizing the world to guard against wicked essences, demonic spirits, dragons, and ghostly entities that might bring calamity, as well as the toxic qi and turbid chaos that disrupt humanity. They must also prevent untimely winds and rains.\n\nBeyond these duties, they must tend to their own being, ensuring their hun and po souls remain upright, their true qi constantly flowing, and their spirit luminous and vigorous—thus attaining longevity. It is further said that those who perform summoning thought-patrols traverse the ten directions of the world, delivering beings with impartiality. Whether serving the state, governing the household, or aiding individuals, their meritorious deeds resonate between Heaven and Earth, and their virtuous deeds are heard in the Jade Capital above. When their merit is complete, the Celestial Emperor dispatches immortal envoys to welcome them, elevating them to the rank of Great Immortal Perfected. Since the time of the Human Sovereign and extending to the era of Luan Ba, those who attained the Dao and practiced these methods were too numerous to record.\n\nYet, in this age, scholars lack true masters, and the original essence of the practice is lost. Unable to uphold the grand principles of the authentic and true, they cling to minor, fragmented techniques, often misapplying them under false names. Such superficial and incomplete practices are hardly worthy of the Dao. If one does not trace the roots and distinguish the branches, the profound mysteries of the original mechanism will remain obscured. Trivial details and peripheral knowledge, when mistaken for the core discipline, prevent scholars from delving into the profound and mastering the ultimate truths.\n\nThus, I have meticulously compiled the essential principles of the ancient summoning methods, placing them at the forefront, while supplementary techniques are arranged thereafter. This is to distinguish their origins and clarify their hierarchy, illuminating the fundamental and the peripheral.\n\n**The Six Meritorious Virtues of Summoning**\nThe Later Sage Lord addressed the Celestial Master, saying: \"These summoning methods, when applied by people, yield six kinds of merit and virtue.\n\nFirst, they can heal illnesses caused by malevolent influences, capture, execute, and eradicate demonic afflictions.\n\nSecond, they can assess the celestial and earthly bureaus to determine the lifespan, wealth, and destiny of individuals.\n\nThird, they can restrain and sever public and private grievances that cause harm.\n\nFourth, they can resolve life-threatening conflicts between husbands and wives, parents and children, ensuring harmony and averting disasters of metal, wood, water, and fire, allowing all to proceed without obstruction.\n\nFifth, they can dissolve public and private curses, vengeful ghosts, and harmful spirits, whether from the living or the dead, as well as schemes and slander, ensuring mutual safety.\n\nSixth, they can eliminate natural disasters—untimely winds and rains, imbalanced four qi, venomous dragons, ferocious spirits, excessive floods and droughts, and pestilential qi. Only those who practice the true celestial methods can eradicate these.\"\n\nThe Celestial Master was further told: \"These six methods were established by the Supreme Great Dao Lord, who wove the true qi of Heaven and Earth into talismans. Comprising one thousand three hundred eighty-one ranks, they constitute the Great Summoning Method. This is the most sublime and wondrous of the Dao’s methods for delivering people and aiding beings. Those who practice it must do so without deceit or reckless application.\n\nWhen a Perfected One completes three thousand merits through this method, they ascend in broad daylight, their entire household—including chickens and dogs—rising to Heaven together.\"\n\n**Establishing the Altar and Visualizing the Master’s Instructions**\nAccording to the *Orthodox Unity Summoning Ritual*: \"The summoning method involves examining ghosts and calling spirits. One must set up an altar, establish the register, construct a prison, and open its gates. A rope is used to encircle the altar and prison, with four gates opened. Prohibited steps and boundary formations are then established. A fragrant offering table and bright lamps are prepared, and during the middle of the night, the Yu step is performed at the center, circling outward in a T-shape to seal the boundary and consecrate the water. Facing west, one visualizes the Three Origins Summoning Orthodox Unity Master, the Venerable Li, and the Grand Preceptor of the Register, the Venerable Li Huiju. At times, their names may be softly invoked. They appear in fluttering purple robes, adorned with crowns and swords, riding nine-colored lions. Purple clouds descend from the northwest, encircling the altar three times. One visualizes bowing three times in reverence, then declares: 'I hereby consecrate this altar.'\n\nThe master then commands the yang soldiers to join the celestial and human realms, uniting with the register soldiers within one’s body to act in concert for a specific household—whether to expel malevolent ghosts or address a particular matter. The master further commands the yin soldiers to assist the register soldiers within one’s body, entering hells, waters, or tombs to capture harmful spirits. The malevolent ghosts and thieves of the household are brought to the altar, interrogated, and their cases reported.\"\n\n**Oral Petition Formula**\n\"I, your subordinate [Name], humbly follow the celestial statutes to perform this method. May the yang and yin masters—if the yang master is absent, visualize the original master in their stead—assist me. I form the Celestial Master’s mudra, invoking the descent of true qi into my body. Aid me in deploying soldiers and spreading qi, releasing water and igniting fire. Dispatch the Three Origins Great Generals, lions, and fierce beasts to unite with me in heart and strength, crushing the mountain, temple, or lair of the malevolent bandits, demons, or evil ghosts. Let their strongholds be shattered, burned, or washed away. Capture the demonic spirits, execute them by waist severance, and cure the illnesses, ensuring the matter is resolved. Additional details may be appended as needed.\"",

      "translated_text": "**Summoning and Interrogation Mudra for Officials and Soldiers**\n\nFor all summoning and interrogation rites, first visualize the master before you, radiating great luminosity. From this light, soldiers emerge in countless numbers, led by the Three Origins and Three Generals, along with the Five Virtue Generals and their armies of hundreds of thousands. Alternatively, visualize the Six Jia and Twelve Divine Generals, the mighty Heavenly Soldiers, arrayed in formation around the person’s dwelling, while also stationing them to guard and defend your own gates. At each gate, deploy sixteen soldiers—eight on each side—wielding blades and spears, as in a military encampment. Once the strict commands are issued, then visualize the master and yourself leading the troops to patrol the aforementioned gates above and below. Only then seal the boundary, recite the prohibitions, and proceed with talismans and documents to summon and apprehend.\n\n**Visualization Mudra for Healing Illness**\n\nWhen visualizing the master to heal illness, from the radiant light, soldiers surge forth to encircle the seas, block the earth, traverse the heavens, and scour the prisons. Together with [the patient], they extract the three *hun* and seven *po* (or fourteen *po* for women), freeing them from the demonic realm and restoring them to the original body, so that the illness is instantly cured.\n\n**Mudras of the Three Masters**\n- The mudra of the *Third Master* is on the first joint of the left hand’s fifth finger.\n- The mudra of the *Original Master* is on the third joint of the second finger.\n- The mudra of the *Celestial Master* is on the second joint.\n\n**Visualization for Summoning and Interrogation**\n\nFor all summoning and interrogation, visualize the master dispatching soldiers precisely as prescribed. Then imagine the Twenty-Eight Constellations arrayed above you. Next, the Three Generals and their officials and soldiers, along with the Three Origins, are fully prepared—the Three Origins’ soldiers and generals are complete. Then form the mudra of the Three Generals, located on the first joint of the left thumb’s center.\n\nOnce done, sit beside the altar, recite the text according to the ritual, summon the spirits and gods, interrogate the malevolent entity’s name, and issue a judgment for its capture and confinement. If the spirit is stubbornly evil, later submit a *Red Memorial* to request heavenly troops to execute the demonic entity. Thus, the illness will swiftly be cured, and the matter promptly resolved. Then express gratitude and repay the favor, offering thanks to the venerated master.\n\n**Summoning, Visualization, Incantation, and Protective Mudra for Healing**\n\nFor the summoning ritual master, always enter a quiet chamber at dawn, wear the talismans, clasp the mudras, pace the Dipper’s steps, and exhale *qi* to form a purple cloud, first covering your own body so that ghosts and spirits cannot harm you in return. Next, when treating illness, visualize the cloud covering the patient’s dwelling on all sides, as well as the afflicted person’s body. Surround them with the Five Directions’ military formations, encircling their body and home, ensuring swift efficacy. Then form the *Capital Supervisor’s* mudra, visualize the Northern Dipper’s seven stars above the head, the Three Terraces covering the back, and the [missing character] star pointing in the appropriate direction.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"The Supreme transmits the teachings,\nThe later sages propagate their flow.\"*",

Next, establish the altar and arrange the ritual implements. Then, clasp the mudra, knock the teeth, and summon the divine generals and spirit soldiers to drive and seize the spirits. Next, use incantations to reveal the forms of the malevolent entities. Then, apply talismanic methods to expel and disperse the pernicious *qi*. Next, dispatch spirit officials to investigate the root cause of the affliction. If wicked or rebellious ghosts remain unsubdued, immediately establish a prison to confine them. Then, following the Celestial Heart method, submit memorials and petitions. Next, perform the Dipper-Raising Rite to shield and conceal the afflicted household. Finally, admonish the household deities to encamp and protect.\n\n**Northern Emperor’s Universal Heaven-Covering Method:**\nThe method is numinous, moving heaven and earth, shifting stars and constellations, unlocking celestial gates, turning the earth’s axis, driving mountains and peaks, and covering spirits.

Ghosts above cannot descend; ghosts below cannot ascend. Above, I unfurl the Celestial Net; below, I spread the Earthly Web. Heavenly ghosts are forbidden from descending to the mortal realm; earthly ghosts are forbidden from revealing their forms. Patrolling the four worlds, all wicked ghosts lie within my covering. I reverently summon the Three-Five Generals, the Five Lakes Generals, the Three Origins Generals, the Huoluo Generals, the officers and soldiers under the Three Masters, the officers and soldiers within the Northern Dipper’s *Kui*, the river officials’ officers and soldiers, the thunder and lightning officers and soldiers, the Southern Dipper’s Ghost-Slaying Envoys, the Northern Dipper’s Blazing Furnace Envoys, the Celestial Couriers’ armored troops, and the ten-thousand-zhang-high striking might of the awe-inspiring sword. The great drum’s mighty warriors, five-eyed and three-eyed, the six-armed Celestial *Ding*, with bronze fangs and iron claws, lightning eyes and six pupils, nine heads and eight horns, crimson hair and indigo bodies, clad in golden spears and silver armor, fill the empty void. Azure Dragon and White Tiger, Vermilion Bird and Victorious Serpent, fierce and colossal beasts, flying owls and hooked ropes. Heavenly Peng and Huoluo, the mighty Flying Heavenly Demon Kings, the Five Directions’ Vajras, the Five Directions’ Warriors, the Five Directions’ officers and soldiers, the Five Directions’ *yakṣas*, the Five Dippers’ encampments, and the clouds converging from the eight directions. The Five Lakes and Seven Marshes, the Five Peaks and Seven Temples, the twenty-four *zhi*’s pits, hollows, caves, and grottoes—all array their ranks, deploying troops step by step. The mountains, forests, and trees are searched meticulously. What spirit does not submit beneath my covering? What ghost does not lie within my net? Those who comply with me will prosper; those who defy me will perish. The merciful shall live; the malevolent shall die. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the law of the Great Yin and the Northern Emperor’s decree!\n\nWhen practicing this method, first visualize the fire of the heart blazing around the body, refining form and spirit. Then imagine oneself as the Summoning Envoy, with awe-inspiring divine majesty, roaring like thunder. Stand facing south, form the Celestial Net and Earthly Web mudra with both hands, and exhale qi like a thunderclap. Immediately recite the preceding incantation, then inhale qi and blow it into the mudra, casting it toward the place where the ritual is performed. Pray thus:\n*Qi transforms into iron; the net is like black clouds. Dark mist envelops heaven and earth, covering the direction of the wicked ghosts.*\n\nFor the Celestial Net and Earthly Web mudra: with the left hand, join the third, fourth, and fifth fingers; with the right hand, join the third, fourth, and fifth fingers. The right thumb presses into the left thumbnail’s base, while the left and right index fingers extend. After reciting the incantation, interlock the index fingers and cast the mudra toward the afflicted household. Then proceed with all ritual methods and prohibitions.\n\n**Method for Revealing Ghosts’ Forms:**\nFirst, have the afflicted person stand at the threshold, eyes closed for a moment. Then, the ritual master takes a mirror in the right hand and, with the left eye, visualizes inscribing a talisman within it. Once done, place the mirror on the table, form the Lion Seal with both hands, and press it over the talisman on the mirror’s surface. The ritual master then holds the mirror before their heart, aligning it properly. Recite the incantation:\n*Heavenly spirits and earthly deities, all numinous beings converge. By the decree of the United Brightness Celestial Emperor, I reverently summon the swift envoys from the eight directions to pursue and capture the malevolent ghost, forcing it to reveal its form.*\n\nThen call the names of the spirits:\n*Om, judge the malevolent! Om, judge the malevolent! Judge and seize! Judge and seize! Take and judge! Take and judge! Śrī! Śrī! Hūrū! Hūrū!*\n*Seize the ghost! Seize the ghost! Seize swiftly! Seize swiftly! Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the law!*\n\nReverently summon the local Day-Patrolling Envoy to pursue and capture the ghost. Reverently summon the local Earth God to pursue and capture the ghost. Reverently summon the local Five Paths Envoy to pursue and capture the ghost.\n\nAfter reciting, face north and shine the mirror once, then recite the incantation again, shining it a second time. Repeat this three times. Once the incantation is complete, have the afflicted person blow qi into the mirror and open their eyes to see within it: whether the affliction is a ghost, spirit, or demon; a deceased family member; or an external ghost—all will be clearly revealed.\n\n**Visualize the talisman and incantation within the mirror:**\n*Celestial August, Earthly August, Human August, Celestial-Human August, Earthly-Human August, Human-Human August. Om, Emperor Sovereign, summon the local Earth God and warrior to capture!*\n*Heaven is yang; earth is yin—ghosts and spirits have nowhere to hide.

Hold the bright mirror in the right hand, press the first joint of the left index finger with the left hand, and visualize the mirror emitting a five-colored radiance, illuminating every direction without exception. Proceed step by step to summon and capture the malevolent ghosts and spirits, allowing none to escape, all appearing before the ritual mirror.\n\n**Water Reflection Method:**\n*Water Official slays ghosts; Earth Official slays ghosts; Heaven Official slays ghosts. Encounter water, water subdues; encounter earth, earth subdues; encounter heaven, heaven subdues. All waters cease flowing; slay the lawless ghosts and send them beneath the Southern Mountain’s foothills to receive death. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the law!*\n\nFor this method, write the characters for \"mountain\" and \"water\" in the air with the right middle finger, then recite the preceding incantation, transforming the words into a spell. With the right hand, scoop from the air into a basin of pure water. Have the afflicted person blow qi into the water. Recite the incantation:\n*By the duty officer, the Day Clerk Envoy, and the Twelve Hour Spirits, swiftly summon the local Earth God and the domain’s proper deities to pursue and capture the malevolent ghost afflicting this person, forcing it to reveal its form swiftly!*",

After the ritual, consume the offerings yourself; discard the remainder in flowing water, sharing with no one. In cases of urgent illness or peril, pray to the Noble One and summon the generals—they will respond immediately. Each spirit general commands troops to relieve suffering. Sincerity and adherence to the method are paramount; never attempt this lightly.\n\n**Method for the Mighty Celestial Ding to Pursue and Capture Malevolent Ghosts**\nFirst establish an altar. Choose a day when the Perfected Warrior descends for the ritual offering. Lay out a clean mat, spread purified yellow earth half an inch thick, and level it. Unfurl the mat atop the earth, placing four incense burners at the center. Arrange seasonal fruits, dried venison, and clear wine in four portions at the cardinal directions, then light the lamps and burn incense. The officiant, dressed in proper attire, approaches the altar, plants a sword upon it, and faces north to bow to the Most High Lord Lao, the Northern Culmen Great Emperor, the Four Sage Perfected Lords, and all spirit generals and troops. Next, visualize the Northern Emperor above the officiant’s head, suspended in the void, clad in a dark dragon robe, wearing a level-heaven crown, black shoes, and a sword, his solemn countenance vividly painted, guarded by the Four Sages. Then summon the four Mighty Celestial Ding spirit generals, each leading troops, to descend from heaven to the altar and partake of the offerings. Read the petition aloud, offering detailed prayers, presenting incense and wine three times without bowing. After the ritual, gather the spirit tablets and enshrine them in the spirit generals’ hall. For subsequent summonings, follow the procedures below, observing the proper decorum.\n\n**Eastern Mighty Celestial Ding Pursuing Ghost General Wen Yu**\nClad in a green robe with wide sleeves, wearing a green headscarf, his face red, he wields twin blades.\n\n**Southern Mighty Celestial Ding Capturing Ghost General Li Gongda**\nDraped in a red-patterned wide-sleeved robe, wearing a red headscarf, his face reddish-yellow, he brandishes an iron staff.\n\n**Western Mighty Celestial Ding Binding Ghost General Wu Tian’an**\nDressed in golden armor, wearing a plain headscarf, his face yellow-white, he holds an iron chain.\n\n**Northern Mighty Celestial Ding Interrogating Ghost General Liu Wuzhen**\nClad in a black wide-sleeved robe, wearing a black headscarf, his face dark and ashen, he wields a halberd.\n\nAfter invoking and offering to each according to their direction, if malevolent spirits or ghosts employ sorcery, summon the generals to pursue, capture, and interrogate them—they will respond with immediate efficacy.\n\n**Northern Dipper Qi-Directing Method for Curing All Illnesses**\nTo treat illness, the officiant faces north with the patient before them. The officiant visualizes the Star Lord Tanlang, ten *zhang* tall, clad in plain silk robes, hair unbound, exhaling blue qi. Upon completing the visualization, inquire about the cause of the illness, then inhale the patient’s qi. Next, recite *Om* to Tanlang, draw in his blue qi, and blow it onto the patient’s afflicted area. With the right hand, gather the qi and recite the incantation:",

      "translated_text": "Upon completing the ritual, when employing the method, thread the cord through the coin’s hole and tap it behind the elbow. For suppressing pain and the like, draw in a breath of *qi*, tightly bind it with the hand, and the effect will manifest immediately.\n\nTo restrain ghosts and spirits, dispel malevolent entities, or suppress inauspicious dwellings, hang the cord on the main hall’s beam or along the path where ghosts and spirits manifest—they will depart at once. Do not wear it when entering sacred temples, and avoid contact with women, chickens, dogs, or miscellaneous objects.\n\n**Heavenly Master’s Method for Interrogating the Stove and Binding Ghosts**\nUse a piece of wood, one foot and two inches in length, fashioned into a three-tiered altar, representing the Three Terraces stars. Visualize yourself as the Interrogating Summoner, stepping upon the Seven Primes’ Net before the stove. When binding the ghost, first have the head of the household hold the binding cord while the master writes the character for \"ghost\" on the ground, reciting:\n*Open the Gate of Heaven, close the Door of Earth,*\n*leave the Human Gate, block the Ghostly Path.*\nCircle the \"ghost\" character three times, then recite:\n*Generals Tang, Ge, and Zhou, hasten forth!*\nImmediately have the head of the household strike the stove three times with the cord, then take it back. Envision the two messengers striking the Stove Lord, forcing him to bind the ghost beneath the character. Strike seven times, reciting [missing characters], then tie the Prison Seal at the cord’s end, followed by the Secure Head and Ghost-Binding Seals. Visualize the Stove Lord bound in prison, then apply the Ghost-Binding Seal again to secure him. Admonish the Stove Lord thus:\n*Ho! Ho! Ho! You are a descendant of Zhang Nuo,*\n*sealed by the Celestial Emperor as the Stove Lord,*\n*charged with protecting this household.*\n*How dare you allow foreign ghosts to enter,*\n*bringing misfortune and disturbance to this dwelling?*\n*Depart at once! Should you disobey,*\n*I shall report you to the Celestial Emperor and the Northern Emperor,*\n*file a petition to the Heavenly Bureau.*\n*Do not say you were not warned!*\n*Swiftly expel the foreign ghosts—*\n*go at once, do not linger, or the blame shall be yours!*\n\nAfter three days, lift the binding cord and burn spirit money for the two messengers, Ābōluó. When using the Ghost-Binding Seal, first recite the Sun and Moon Lords’ incantation, then step upon the Celestial Net.\n\n*Great Sage Sun, Great Sage Moon,*\n*descend with your radiant light,*\n*your true *qi* of original form,*\n*enter my Ghost-Binding Seal.*\n\n**Ghost-Binding Seal**\n*Chén*: raise the stroke upward from the second horizontal.\n*Gèn*: press the middle joint of the middle finger.\n*Yín*: on yin days, use the right hand; on yang days, the left, crossing them in application.\n\n**Method for Imprisoning Ghosts in the Fire Prison**\nOn the southeastern *dìhù* (Earth Door), first spread a layer of fine ash to form a level circle three feet and six inches in diameter, leaving the southern gate open. Add another layer of ash, leaving the northern gate open. Drive the ghost in through the northern gate, then write the character for \"fire\" at the southern gate’s entrance with ash. When closing the prison gate, again write \"fire\" to seal it.\n\n**Diagram of the Fire Prison**\n**Incantation for Erecting the Fire Prison**\n*Humbly invoke the Fire Bell Generals and Fire Bell Officers of the southern quarter,*\n*descend from heaven to close my prison gate,*\n*drive and bind malevolent ghosts,*\n*subject them to interrogation and punishment.*\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*\n\nUpon reciting, draw in *qi* and blow it into the prison. When the master establishes the prison, first visualize himself as the Great Emperor of Zhūlíng, pressing the nail of the left hand’s third finger, stepping upon the *Dīng* Net while reciting the incantation. If the ghost is particularly fierce, or if many ghosts are to be interrogated that day, or if unresolved malevolent matters persist, drive them into the Fire Prison to be incinerated.\n\n**Method for Locking the Gate**\n*The might of Heaven slays, the power of Earth seizes the true direction.*\n*A thousand evils, ten thousand ghosts—who dares remain hidden?*\n*With a single step and a breath drawn, all ghosts perish.*\n*Left Kuí, right [missing character], the divine powers seize.*\n*Lock them so none escape—*\n*the divine generals swiftly bind them.*\n*I act by the Northern Emperor’s decree.*\n\nIf someone petitions claiming harm from malevolent forces, the master first transforms into a deity to receive and restrain them, then proceeds with the dispatch. As the petitioner exits, the master forms the Locking Seal with his hand, takes three steps upon the *Dīng* Net, summons the divine generals, and draws the *qi* of the Celestial Net, reciting three times toward the northwest. Then, drawing the *qi* of the sun’s rays, he blows it onto the seal and directs it toward the afflicted person’s dwelling, silently commanding:\n*Divine generals, swiftly lock them—*\n*let none escape the slightest gap.*\nEnvision the Four Upright and Six *Jiǎ* warriors surrounding the place, locking down the malevolent ghosts.\n\n**Northern Dipper’s Method for Entering a House to Protect the Body**\n*Northern Dipper’s seven stars, I call you by name.*\n*Malevolent spirits and lingering corpses, earthbound ghosts—hide your forms!*\n*The Eight Kings’ soldiers, wherever I go,*\n*guard my body for a thousand miles.*\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*\n\nWhen the master arrives at the afflicted household, after entering and taking several steps, he visualizes himself as True Warrior, hair unbound and sword in hand, with the Four Upright Messengers, the Celestial Pivot, the Earthly Axis, and their retinue following. Forming the Dipper Seal with his left hand, he silently recites the incantation three times. Upon reaching the main hall, he sits and commands the afflicted person to be brought forth for questioning and treatment.\n\n**Four Numinous Powers’ Method for Seizing Ghosts**\n*Zhōng the True, Zǐ the Scenic, descend with the wronged and the sagely hosts.*\n*Swiftly, Four Numinous Powers, in samādhi descend with truth!*\n*Four divine generals, seize the wronged souls at once!*\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*\n\nHave the afflicted person stand facing the master with eyes closed. The master then faces north, presses the *mǎo* trigram with his left hand, recites the incantation three times, draws a breath of *qi* from each of the four directions, takes a sip of water, and together with the *qi*, sprays it onto the afflicted person’s face, shouting:\n*Divine generals, swiftly seize the ghost and deliver it into this body!*\nIf the body trembles, it is a sign of efficacy.\n\n**Another Seizing Method**\n*Humbly invoke the True Lord of the South, present in the bǐng direction,*\n*swiftly descend with true fire into my water.*\n*Heavenly Strategist, Heavenly Slayer,*\n*aid my incantation’s power, aid my Daoist method,*\n*seize the ghosts and spirits at once!*\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!*\n\nFace south, press the Dipper Seal with the left hand and the *zǐ* trigram with the right. Hold a bowl of pure water, draw in a breath of true *qi* from the sun, recite the incantation three times, and draw a breath of *qi* from each of the four directions, blowing them into the water. Then, envision the southern fire blazing across the sky, draw in a breath, and blow it into the water. Perform this method three times.",

The step-net rides upon the upright *qi* to govern beings; the seal-gaze operates through the divine mechanism to enact transformation. Whether cultivating immortality and refining the true, or summoning, commanding, and subduing, none can do without these.\n\nThough earlier versions of the method texts recorded their outlines, omissions in practical application were not few. Here, I have compiled what has been transmitted to make them complete. May this modest effort encompass the vast, so that the marvels of the method families may be fully realized in their application.\n\n**Method of Yu’s Steps and Dipper-Net Seals**\n\nYu’s steps emulate the images of creation and the movements of the sun and moon’s measured cycles. One month has three conjunctions; each conjunction spans three decades. These three decades are the three full numbers. One season has three conjunctions; these three conjunctions make nine decades. Thus, one step is one conjunction; one conjunction has three traces. Three steps yield nine traces, symbolizing one season. Bringing the feet together represents the celestial conjunction.\n\nRaising the left foot first is the step of spring and autumn; raising the right foot first is the step of winter and summer.

      "translated_text": "Thus, life and death, control and command employ spring and autumn; storage and accumulation employ winter and summer. It is also said: men should use spring and autumn, while women should use winter and summer.\n\nMoreover, the three steps and nine traces emulate the three origins and nine qi. The twelve traces emulate the twelve pitch-pipes. The fifteen traces emulate the numbers of three and five.\n\nThe art of adapting to circumstances lies in the subtleties of the method’s weight and measure. Yet it is called \"Yu’s Steps\" because Great Yu, in regulating the waters, accomplished a work that covered the heavens. He was truly bestowed this step-method to control spirits and summon numinous beings, hence it was named \"Yu’s Steps.\"\n\nIn all step-treading methods, visualize the body as the Envoy of the Demon-Quelling Court, the Orthodox Unity Dharma Master, the Three Origins and Five Virtues General, the Clerk and Merit Officers, the Lion and White Crane, with an array of attendants standing guard.\n\nFirst recite the Purification Mantra. According to the scriptural method, stepping with the mind focused on the spirit is especially efficacious; one need not rely solely on physical traces.\n\nThe scripture states: \"Yu’s Steps were received by Yu from the Most High, unfolding the celestial net and earthly principles. Externally, they are Yu’s Steps, seeking the true and restraining the hundred things—humans, spirits, dragons, ghosts, evil beasts, venomous insects—subduing them without killing. Those who resist and do not submit are executed.\"\n\nIts principles include combining the five dipper-stars into three steps and nine traces, or twelve traces, or thirty-five traces, or fifteen traces. There are also methods for reversing and circling three times, which are listed below.\n\nWhen stepping the seven stars, proceed from the first to the seventh, called \"forward progression.\" Then reverse from the seventh back. Return again from the first to the seventh, called \"reverse progression.\" The \"earthly gate\" signifies ascending from the earthly gate to heaven.\n\n**Method of Three Steps and Nine Traces**\nThe scripture states: \"First, as the Flying Celestial Net treading the Earthly Principles, Yu’s Steps transform into nine traces, also corresponding to the Dipper’s numbers, circling forward, backward, and reverse three times. Stepping three times is not as effective as performing the Three Nets three times. If one seeks swift efficacy, simply step the old net three times, once on the left and once on the right—men emphasize the left, women the right. After completing left and right, repeat once more, totaling three presses.\"\n\n**Method of Twelve-Trace Yu’s Steps**\n**Method of Three-Five-Trace Yu’s Steps**\n**Method of Treading Earthly Principles and Flying Celestial Net**\nFor Yu’s Steps of the Flying Celestial Net treading Earthly Principles, all must be performed in reverse three times.\n\nThe scripture states: \"For those who perform hidden merits to aid the state, protect the body, and save others, first tread the Earthly Principles three times, then fly the Celestial Net three times, then disperse into the three-step, nine-trace Yu’s Steps, turning the Celestial Pivot to strike and halt. If fearing it will not stop, perform the twelve-step Yu’s Steps once, or step fifteen steps. Visualize the upper, middle, and lower Three Generals, their troops, and the Six Jia spirits, turning the Celestial Pivot to point at them. Doing this three times will dissolve all matters without harming the lives of yin spirits or creatures. If performed six times, what is controlled can be destroyed, restraining its reckless actions and diminishing one’s merit and virtue.\"\n\nThe scripture states: \"When stepping to control or destroy, simultaneously form the Knife-Finger Seal with the left and right hands, on the third joint of the fifth finger. When dealing with violent people, form the Knife-Finger Seal for evil persons on the right side of the third joint of the right hand’s fifth finger. The right governs killing, the left governs life; do not act recklessly, and carefully examine the principles. To subdue evil ghosts, form the Ghost-Knife Seal on the underside of the third joint of the left hand’s fifth finger.\"\n\nThe scripture states: \"For malevolent spirits, poisonous dragons, demonic ghosts causing reckless storms and violent rains that harm people and things, whether on water or land, step the Celestial Net and Earthly Principles each three times, dispersing into nine, twelve, or fifteen traces of Yu’s Steps, or perform three reversals. First nine steps, then reverse to the net’s head, then perform twelve steps, then reverse to fifteen steps. Align left and right with clothing, grasp the Dipper-Star with the left hand and point. Turn the Celestial Pivot, raising the hand to point three, six, or nine times, three rounds, and the poisonous demons will cease. Six rounds will cause harm and illness; nine rounds will result in death. Though this is a method of restraint and killing not of the Dao, one must not fail to be cautious in its principles. Assess the demonic affliction; if it ceases, release it, and do not kill immediately. If people and things are unsettled, or there are droughts, floods, or baleful stars, all can be restrained and governed.\"\n\nThe various diagrams of the Celestial Net, Earthly Principles, and Three-Five Yu’s Steps are of great importance, each with its own scriptural methods. Here, only the essentials are briefly outlined, so that practitioners of the method may know the ladder to its profound mysteries and recognize the threshold of the Original True.\n\n**Purification Mantra for Ascending Steps**\n\"I purify my body with the sun, refine my true nature with the moon. Immortals assist me; sun and moon aid my form. The twenty-eight constellations unite with me; a thousand evils and ten thousand impurities are swept away by water and made clear. Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.\"\n\n**Method of Yu’s Steps for Heaven-Earth Harmony**\nWhenever ascending Yu’s Steps, first recite the incantation:\n\"I am the Great One of the Grotto’s depths, my head bears the Seven Stars, my steps tread the Four Numinous Beasts. Grasping the golden sword, I stand in the Xun position, meandering in procession until I reach Kun. The earthly gate at Xun Palace must be sealed until I reach the Heavenly Gate to pay homage to the Emperor Lord. Three steps and nine traces ascend the Bright Star; the three disasters and nine calamities depart from my body. Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.\"\n\nAfter completing Yu’s Steps, recite the incantation:\n\"Qian honors the radiant spirit; Kun complies with the inner camp. The Two Modes harmonize; the Six Directions are auspicious and upright. Heaven and earth unite in prosperity; eternal peace and solemn clarity. Responding to the primordial yellow, above is the robe, below the skirt. Zhen ascends, Gen rises; Kan complies, Li shines. Xun flourishes, Dui generates; tiger steps and dragon soars. Heavenly Gate, Earthly Gate, Human Gate, Ghost Gate. Who guards me? The vast azure heavens. Today’s Yu’s Steps correspond to the Celestial Net above. Ghosts and spirits submit as guests; below, misfortune is repelled. What is sought is granted; the response is timely and numinous. Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.\"\n\nAfter reciting the step-incantations, proceed according to the method and follow the heart’s intent.",

My humble feelings are overwhelmed with longing for the sagely response, trembling with awe.\n\nYour servant [Name], with awe and reverence, bows his head again and again, respectfully states.\n\nPetition presented on the [Day] day of the [Month] month of the [Year of the Great Era], by your servant [Full Title and Name].\n\n---\n\n**Method for Establishing the Celestial Prison**\n\nWhen establishing the Celestial Prison, first select a location according to the directional guidelines and prepare a pure chamber, ensuring it is secure and tightly sealed. Sweep and purify it thoroughly before constructing the prison.\n\n**Directional Formula**\nIn the first month, [build] at *zi*; the fifth and ninth months share the same [direction].\nIn the second month, the sixteenth [day] is in the Rabbit Garden.\nThe third and seventh [months], the eleventh [day], are within the Horse Pen.\nThe fourth and eighth [months], the twelfth [day], enter the Chicken Coop.\n\nWhen establishing the prison, first transform the spirit. Then take three steps in the *ding* register, visualizing two blue-clad youths holding sword seals standing to the left and right. Assume the role of the **Expelling Demonic Influences Bureau Envoy**, wearing the **Interlocking Harmony Crown** and the **Fish-Scale Robe**. Hold the **Samādhi Fire Bell Sword** in the right hand and the **Lord of the Celestial Law Seal** in the left.\n\nWithin the prison chamber, step through the **Seven Stars Register**, having an assistant follow each step to insert bamboo stakes. Then take a left-twisted hemp rope and strike each star in sequence.\n\nFirst, write two **Summoning Ghost Talismans**, one in cinnabar and one in ink. Attach five paper coins to the front of the prison. Burn the talismans while visualizing the **Summoning Ghost Talisman Envoy** in the form of a swift runner. Then form the **Summoning Ghost Mudra** (the mudra is found in the eighth scroll) and recite the incantation:\n\n> *\"Celestial Prison, numinous and bright,*\n> *By the Emperor’s command, act with might.*\n> *The Celestial Law’s decree is stern,*\n> *Seize and bind the demonic, show no concern.*\n> *Swiftly, swiftly, as the law ordains!\"*\n\nTake a strip of paper and write in cinnabar:\n*\"By order of Mount Tai, the attending divine generals are to apprehend all malevolent ghosts and spirits causing harm and bring them to this prison.\"*\n\nAbove this text, write the title and rank of the ritual master in one line, followed by a decorative flourish. Above the flourish, write *\"By the Emperor’s Decree.\"*\n\nRecite the previous **Celestial Prison Incantation**, then form the **Supreme Emperor Mudra** and the **Celestial Soldier Mudra**, and affix the paper to the bamboo stake of the Celestial Prison.\n\nVisualize black silk transforming into dark clouds, and the **Northern Dipper** manifesting as the **Dark Celestial Prison**. On yang days, use lime; on yin days, use charcoal ash, each seven inches wide.\n\nEstablish the prison beneath the **Military Brilliance Star**, making it round and twelve inches in diameter. Use nine green bamboo stalks, each four feet and nine inches long. The stars and prison are delineated with fine ash, and bamboo stakes mark each position. The bamboo serves as the upright prison officers.\n\nUse nine strips of black silk, each nine inches long and one inch two-tenths wide, tied seven inches below the top of the bamboo stakes. Write the names of the Eight Stars in cinnabar on the black silk.\n\nThe prison is closed by day and opened by night. Take care to avoid disturbance, and do not use lamps or candles.\n\nWhen treating illness, point the register toward the patient’s bedchamber. For other matters, point the register toward the monthly branch.\n\nIf after two nights no traces appear in the Celestial Prison, repeat the previous written instructions to urge the attending divine generals. Affix a large inscription of *\"Celestial Prison\"* to the door of the prison chamber.\n\nWhether there is a response or not, proceed according to the circumstances, following the **Yang Dao Public Law** without yielding to human sentiment.\n\nThe establishment of the prison must not be witnessed by others; only the ritual master should enter and exit regularly.\n\nThe **Five Prison Masters of the Expelling Demonic Influences Bureau** and the **Direct Altar Earth Deity** must first be offered paper money and horses.\n\n---\n\n**Summoning Ghost Talisman Formula**\n\nWhen writing the talisman, face the monthly branch. When burning it, recite the prayer:\n*\"All malevolent spirits causing harm, swiftly return to your origin and be seized!\"*\n\n---\n\n**Method for Verifying Ghost Traces in the Prison**\n\nIf the ghost is fierce and violent, it will manifest in its true form. If it is a yin and subtle ghost, only traces will appear.\n\nIf the patient’s life is fated to end, a double trace will appear beneath their natal star in the prison, indicating the arrival of the **Soul-Summoning Envoy**. Examine this carefully and promptly dissolve the prison.\n\n- **Chicken traces** indicate a visiting death.\n- **Human traces**, large or small, indicate the **Five Penetrations**.\n- **Cat, rat, or fox traces** indicate mountain spirits.\n- **Human hands or feet** indicate fierce and violent mountain deities.\n- **Snake or earthworm traces** indicate kitchen gods, Buddhist statues, earth deities, altar mats, or ancestral ghosts.\n- **Goose or duck traces** with bloodstains indicate ghosts of violent death.\n- **Raised mounds** indicate temple or monastic spirits causing harm.\n- **Small traces like knife cuts** indicate disturbances from construction in the household.\n- **Mule, donkey, ox, or horse traces**, large, indicate household **gu** poison; small, indicate neighboring **gu** poison.\n- **Rope-drag marks** indicate hanging ghosts.\n- **Chaotic ant-like traces** indicate **consumptive corpse ghosts**.\n- **Traces like a small finger, uniform at both ends**, indicate **tomb-curse ghosts**; smaller ones indicate disturbances from mountains, forests, slopes, or ponds.\n- **Traces resembling a small finger with one end larger** indicate **water ghosts**.\n\n---\n\n**Method for Dissolving the Celestial Prison**",

If a person’s illness lingers and resists medical treatment, these lamps should be lit.\nFirst, use sixty-four ounces of pure oil, one ounce of wood, one ounce of licorice, one fen of borneol, one ounce of peach twigs (each nine inches long), half an ounce of realgar, and half an ounce of cinnabar. Except for the cinnabar, steep all ingredients in the oil for seven days, facing the direction of Longevity. Guard it with the Great Black Destruction Talisman, and seal the bottle’s mouth with the Three Lights Talisman. When the days are complete, remove the herbs, pour the oil into a clean lamp, and coat the lamp’s green rim thickly with cinnabar.\nFrom the patient’s natal star, hold the breath, pace the Net, and light the lamp as before, directing the Dipper’s handle toward the patient’s bedroom.\nDo not use paper wicks; ignite the lamp with pine resin.

They are strictly forbidden from remaining to inflict further calamity or harm upon the living. The afflicted’s hun and po souls shall be restored to their body, and their ailment shall dissipate.\n\nShould any entity disregard this decree and persist in causing harm, the responsible divine officials and spirits shall be punished alongside the malevolent specters, demoted, and reported to the Eastern Peak, thereby forfeiting their path to rebirth.\n\nThis memorandum is issued to the Controller of Destiny, the Five Paths Earth Deity, and the divine officials of local shrines in the household of so-and-so.
