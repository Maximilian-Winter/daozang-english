  "full_translation": "**The Dragon Gate Heart-Law**\n*Compiled by the Pure Perfection Master of the Great Qing, Kunyang Zi Wang Changyue (7th Generation Dragon Gate Preceptor), with the 8th Generation Disciple of Vows, Shi Shouping, and annotated by the 11th Generation Descendant, Min Yide*\n\n**Preface: The True Words of the Heart-Law**\n\nIn the year Kangxi 2 (1663), in the month of October, on a favorable day, Kunyang Zi expounded the Precepts at the Jinyin Biyuan [Golden Temple Garden] in Jinling [Nanjing].\n\nTo the Concentrated-True Master Shao Shoushan and the Soaring-True Master Zhan Shouchun, he said:\n\n*\"Since my youthful years, I have aspired to the Dao, piercing through the illusory nature of mortal life—its emptiness, the impermanence of this phantom realm. To escape the wheel of rebirth, one must early cultivate the Supreme Way.\n\nYet though Mount Kongtong is near, Guangcheng Zi [Laozi] does not grant an audience;\nThough Penglai Island is not distant, how can a common man attain it?\n\nOne must resolutely withdraw from defilement, sweep away all dust, purify the heart, and cleanse the will—\nuntil worldly habits crumble like ash,\nand the body of desire is purged, severing the roots of delusion.\n\nWhen all causes cease, one advances step by step through Precept and Meditation;\nWhen all thoughts dissolve, one perceives layer by layer through Wisdom.\n\nTo break free is to attain steadiness;\nTo see through is to endure.\n\nThus, raise the brows like blades—\nwield the knife that severs attachment;\ntake bold strides—\nascend the path of world-transcendence.\n\nTurn the body, and escape the wheel;\nshift the mind, and break free from the net.\n\nIf compassion does not fade, as the ancients said: 'First save oneself, then others';\nIf benevolent resolve endures, I wish to save myself—then save all beings.\"*\n\n*\"I recall my past search for Truth and the Dao:\nI visited Wangwu Mountain and met a wise teacher.\nAbove, I received the boundless grace of the Three Jewels,\nand personally heard the Dharma-Treasure.\nBelow, I relied on my own strength,\nenduring hardship to refine the body.\n\nI took refuge in the Supreme Dharma-King,\nand walked the Path of the Great Vehicle’s perfection.\n\nNow in this flourishing age of peace and ease—\nan era rare in ten thousand kalpas, scarce in a thousand lifetimes—\nhow dare I not proclaim the Three Jewels,\nand repay the Four Debts of Gratitude!\n\nLet me fulfill even a drop of dust’s worth of aspiration,\nand offer this humble measure of clarity.\"*\n\n“Thus, I do not forget the transgressions of presumption and arrogance, and open the hall to expound the precepts;\nI do not shun the slander of ridicule and mockery, and expound teachings and scriptures.\nThis is not for the sake of seeking fame through good deeds,\nbut to dispel evil and resolve doubts.\nHeaven’s law brooks no idle words,\nand the Supreme Dao lies only in plain speech.\n\nI now solemnly convey the seventh-generation family tradition of the Dragon Gate lineage\nto all assembled.\nWith reverence, I record the unvarnished truth of the Jade Garden,\nfor the benefit of all beings in heaven and earth.\nI dare not indulge in empty rhetoric—\nso let me speak plainly.\n\nToday, I impart this to you,\ntruly to guide the lost and illuminate the true Dharma.”\n\n*“As for those of the highest vehicle—enlightened ones with keen insight—\nI am fortunate to be in their presence,\nand earnestly request their compassionate instruction,\nto verify what I have heard.\nThis is my sincere wish.”*\n\nUpon hearing these words, the Master bowed and withdrew, standing to the east and west.\nThen, the disciple from Guangling, Shi Shouping, knelt and chanted:\n\n“The source of Dharma is without Dharma, yet the mind creates its cause;\nThe mind is without mind, yet Dharma is emptiness.\nWhen the mind manifests the Dharma-King’s mind, it manifests form;\nWhen the mind takes refuge in Dharma, it takes refuge in emptiness.\nTo truly understand Dharma’s essence is not to cling to its roundness,\nOne must awaken to the fact that the ordinary mind is the sacred mind.\nMind and Dharma, Dharma and mind—\nWhen mind and Dharma are resolved, liberation is known.”\n\n**II. Taking Refuge in the Three Jewels**\n\nThe Three Jewels are the Dao, the scriptures, and the teacher.\nThe Dao is originally formless and nameless, the void itself—\nwithout scriptures, it cannot be made clear.\nThe Dao resides within the scriptures, profound and subtle—\nwithout a teacher, its principles cannot be grasped.\nIf one does not take refuge in the Three Jewels,\none will surely sink into heretical paths,\nlost in inversion and delusion.\n\nAll who aspire to cultivate the True Dao and seek the Way\nmust, with sincere resolve, take refuge.\nThey should cherish this rare encounter as a precious opportunity.\n\nFirst, take refuge in the Jewel of the Supreme Dao,\nand pray that all beings may forever attend the Celestial Sovereign,\neternally freed from the wheel of rebirth.\n\nSecond, take refuge in the Jewel of the Supreme Scripture,\nand pray that all beings may, life after life,\nhear the true Dharma.\n\nThird, take refuge in the Jewel of the Supreme Teacher,\nand pray that all beings may study the highest vehicle,\nand never fall into erroneous views.\n\nThese Three Refuges are the first step upward taken by ancient sages\nto guide others into the Way,\nthe first gate of virtue through which one enters.\n\nTo become an immortal, to attain the Dao,\nto become a sage or a worthy—\nall begin with these Three Refuges.\nWhy?\nBecause the nature of life and death, the great matters of existence,\nare subtle and mysterious, unseen and unheard.\nThe supreme vehicle of liberation and wondrous Dharma—\nif not for a true teacher’s compassionate guidance,\nwho could suddenly awaken to the true teachings of the Great Vehicle,\ngradually entering the boundless Dao,\nand avoid falling into heresy or straying into false paths?\n\nThus, those who have not yet understood the Dao must first take refuge in the scriptures.\nThose who have not yet understood the scriptures must first take refuge in the teacher.\nIf one takes refuge in the Jewel of the Teacher,\nthen the Jewel of the Scripture may be heard where it was not heard before.\nIf one hears the Jewel of the Scripture,\nthen the Jewel of the Dao may be seen where it was not seen before.\nWhat was once unseen and unheard suddenly becomes clear—\nall through the power of taking refuge in the Jewel of the Teacher.\n\nThus, one naturally awakens to the true text,\nunderstands the true Dharma,\ntranscends birth and death,\nand escapes the wheel of rebirth.\n\nBut the path of taking refuge in the Three Jewels that I speak of\nmust be in the true Three Jewels.\nWhy?\nO assembled ones!\n\nNowadays, the Three Refuges are treated as mere convention—morning and evening before the sacred images, one merely recites and pays homage, without ever truly penetrating the essence of taking refuge. Why then does one come? Thus, one ultimately remains mired in heretical teachings and cannot escape the cycle of rebirth. How then can one attain the Great Dao and transcend birth and death?\n\n*(She Shi’s note: The above two sections concern matters of principle.)*\n\nThose who speak of taking refuge in the Three Jewels must do so in truth. Taking refuge in **intention (意)**, one cultivates the thought of impermanence, and thus the Jewel of the Dao may be illuminated. Taking refuge in **mind (心)**, one removes all obstructions, and thus the Jewel of the Scripture may be awakened. Taking refuge in **body (身)**, one renders the eyes blind to sight, the ears deaf to sound, the nose insensitive to scent, the tongue unable to taste, the hands restrained from movement, and the feet from wandering—untainted by lust, deceit, or impurity—practicing austerities, laboring the sinews, starving the flesh, weakening the limbs, and abandoning the physical form. Only then may one truly invoke the Jewel of the Teacher.\n\n*(She Shi’s note: What is meant by taking refuge in intention, mind, and body are already practical methods. In the initial stages of the Dao of the Elixir, if one takes refuge in intention, the True Gentleman (真士) naturally arises; if one takes refuge in mind, True Fire manifests; if one takes refuge in body, the body remains still while True Water emerges. The foundation of the Dao of the Elixir lies in the purity of the water source, and its greatest key lies in two things: one, if the body does not move recklessly, the water is pure; if the body moves recklessly, the water is turbid; two, if the fire is pure, the water is pure, but if the fire is turbid, the water is also turbid. Thus, taking refuge in the body and in the mind naturally makes foundation-building effortless. And when all three Jewels are taken as refuge, the practice can progress layer by layer.)*\n\nIf one can move the Teacher’s compassion and receive transmission of the Scripture and the Dao, it must be through taking refuge in one’s own body, mind, and intention as the true Three Jewels. My own ears and eyes have not yet forgotten their seeing and hearing—whether lost in the illusions of form or attached to emptiness. So long as sound and color remain, the body is not true. How then can it invoke the Teacher?\n\nWhen one can maintain the body upright, cultivate the root through practice, and align the mind with the True and Eternal, then each thought becomes boundless emptiness, serene and tranquil—this is called taking refuge in the Three Jewels. *(Note: Taking refuge in the Three Jewels is the supreme practice of the Celestial Immortal Dao, namely, \"upright the body, empty the mind, true the thought.\" The beginning and end are no different—how direct and unadorned! Though the practice has no fixed stages, it naturally progresses layer by layer. Kunyangzi, in compassion for later generations, revealed this Dao in this scripture. Alas, today’s people pass by in a daze, failing to grasp the meaning beyond the words. They treat this book as a mere disciplinary or expiatory sutra.)*\n\nIf the body does not indulge in licentiousness, the Teacher-Jewel may be invoked;\nIf the mind is not veiled in delusion, the Scripture-Jewel may be realized;\nIf the intention is not divided in its application, the Dao-Jewel may be illuminated. *(Note: An intention undivided is the utmost sincerity without cessation—see *Heavenly Immortal Heart Transmission* and *Rain of Fragrance Celestial Scripture Spell Commentary*.)*\n\nWhen the body is steadfast, essence is preserved and the physique thrives;\nWhen the mind is luminous, qi is pure and wisdom flows;\nWhen the intention is sincere, spirit condenses and nature manifests.\nWith essence and qi abundant, spirit and intelligence transform boundlessly—all arising from taking refuge in the self’s Three Jewels of body, mind, and intention. Yet the Dao, scripture, and teacher emerge from this foundation.\n\nNow, let us speak of the method for taking refuge in the Three Jewels of body, mind, and intention.\n\n**Assemblage!**\nEach of you must focus your minds and listen carefully—I shall now explain the method of taking refuge in the Three Jewels of body, mind, and intention, so that you may dispel darkness and resolve doubt.\n\n**Assemblage!**\nThis body is formed from the union of father’s essence and mother’s blood, shaped through conception. Its emotions, nature, features, and limbs all develop within the womb. A clump of filth, a sack of the four great elements—eyes see, ears hear, feet move, hands sway, mouth speaks, tongue tastes—none of these are enduring or virtuous things.\n\nThe wise use of it leads to becoming an Immortal or Buddha, a Sage or Virtuous One;\nThe unwise use of it leads to becoming a demon, monster, ghost, or beast.\nA single turn upward grants access to the Heavenly Realm;\nA single turn downward plunges one into the Hellish Realms.\nThose who receive blessings treat it as an external thing;\nThose who receive suffering treat it as their foundation.\nHow much more so for you, who have already left home to transcend birth and death?\nYou must take refuge in this body—anything less is inadequate.\nOtherwise, the six senses will stray outward, and the three poisons will fester within.\nTen thousand calamities and myriad disasters, nine demons and ten trials—all arise from the body.\nHow then can one practice and enter the Dao?\n\nIf you wish to take refuge, there is but one method to subdue this body:\nObserve and uphold the precepts, tame the wild corpse.\nTake the four great dignities as your foundation—conduct yourself with restraint in walking, standing, sitting, and lying.\nMake the ears deaf to sound, the eyes blind to color,\nCultivate a majestic and wondrous form, upright and compassionate,\nSo that others, seeing you, rejoice and generate reverence.\nWhen the precepts restrain the wild body, transforming it into the Dharma-body, then the Teacher-Jewel may be taken as refuge.\n\n**Assemblage!**\nHaving now clarified the first segment of the method, you must next take refuge in the mind.\n**Assemblage!**\nThis mind differs from this body in another way...\n\n「Perilous and malevolent transformations are unfathomable,\nLike winds sweeping the sea, its waters deep and vast,\nWhen the wind surges fierce, waves and tides rise tumultuous,\nTossing and roaring, their ascent and descent unmeasurable,\nRolling and turning with no fixed course.\n\nSince the beginning of the kalpas, it has been said:\nNo hope of escape, an endless sea of suffering.\n\nNow, to take refuge in this mind,\nYou must first recognize that this mind is but a clump of congealed flesh and blood,\nFar from being a lasting, benevolent substance.\n\nIt relishes sound and color, fearing neither transgression of the precepts nor punishment;\nIt indulges in sweet foods, heedless of losing life or limb.\nIt sinks into the torments of hungry ghosts and animal rebirths without dread,\nNor does it flinch at being cast into fiery mountains or burning pits.\nIt drifts through plagues and calamities without hesitation,\nNor avoids causing stars to fall or mountains to crumble.\nAll manner of calamitous causes—\nThis mind alone summons them and sets them in motion.\n\nThe Six Bandits march as vanguard, the Seven Emotions lead as generals.\nIf one seeks to practice without first taking refuge in this mind,\nHow could they subdue demons and spirits,\nRemove the Seven Hindrances and banish evil,\nPenetrate the fundamental principle,\nObtain the true Dharma,\nDelve deeply into the essence,\nAnd attain the highest vehicle?\n\nYet to master this mind,\nOne must again uphold the precepts while cultivating *mingxin* (冥心) and entering *ding* (定).\nReining in the horse with the bridle and whip,\nTurning back the wind and extinguishing the flames.\nWhen this mind’s unenlightened fire is quenched,\nThen the water of forbearance may conquer it.\nTransforming the raging flames into the wind of wisdom,\nChanging unenlightenment into great knowledge.\nShifting evil causes into virtuous fruits,\nDissolving sorrow and resentment into joy and delight.\nRising above sound and color as fleeting dust,\nConverting sloth and arrogance into reverence.\n\nWithout delusion or murkiness,\nNo confusion of right and wrong,\nNo battling between attachment and aversion,\nNo vacillation in coming and going,\nNo shifting in gain and loss—\nThen naturally, *qi* settles and the mind grows still,\nMind still and *qi* settled,\nAnd the scriptural refuge may be taken.\n\n**Assemblage!**\nHaving now cultivated the power of *ding* (定),\nTo subdue this mind of congealed flesh and blood,\nThen the winds and waves grow tranquil,\nThe waters smooth and the moon ascends,\nPearls radiate clarity, wisdom illuminates the scriptures,\nAnd insight penetrates the teachings’ depths.\nYou must next take refuge in this *yi* (意).\n\nThis *yi* is yet more difficult to subdue than this mind—\nThe mind seeks rectitude, but *yi* lies in sincerity.\nSincerity is the state of *shenmi* (慎密).\n\n*Ding* (定) is within this *shenmi* (慎密),\nWith clarity and distinctness,\nNo obstruction of light or shadow,\nNo duality, no cessation,\nMotion and stillness in perfect harmony,\nIllumination universal.\n\nThus, without taking refuge in *yi*,\nEven the mind’s *ding* and stillness remain uncertain.\nIt secretly plots and seizes power,\nIts schemes mechanical and deceitful;\nFantastic and delusive, it fluctuates wildly—\nSometimes present, sometimes gone.\nIts machinations are manifold,\nSwiftly vanishing, swiftly arising,\nLike dragons or tigers in cunning guise.\nUncatchable as shadows or wind,\nThough one may grasp at it,\nIt has no form to see.\n\nA single spark can ignite a thousand *jun* (钧) of force,\nA single drop can flood a thousand *hu* (斛) of water,\nIts stratagems countless, its designs vast.\nIts power unfathomable—\nIt can steal the day and deceive the heavens,\nIts guile boundless.\nOnly after taking refuge in *yi* does it dissolve like water,\nAs if all things return to spring.\n\nThen one may enter sainthood and attain truth,\nAscend to immortality and grasp the Dao.\nIn the mundane world, one may transform and guide,\nBringing peace to the realm and stability to the people,\nHarmony to the seasons and abundance to the harvest,\nAnd cultivate loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness.\n\nThe Three Bonds and Five Relationships arise from sincere *yi*,\nThe Nine Schools and Three Teachings manifest from sincere *yi*.\nBetween sincerity and insincerity,\nSuffering and fortune, calamity and blessing,\nAll depend on this *yi*.\nIt is the cause of life and death,\nThe handle of rebirth and karmic retribution.\n\n**Assemblage!**\nIf *yi* is not sincere before its stirrings,\nThe mind’s delusion remains unchecked—\nLike stars following the Big Dipper’s pivot.\nWhen *yi* is sincere,\nOne may seize the power of life and death.\nWhen *yi* is insincere,\nWho wields the reins of rebirth?\n\n**Assemblage!**\nWithin your own mind lies the *yi*-Jewel,\nA single thought of purity—\nAbove, it connects with the heavens,\nBelow, it reaches the underworld.\nGhosts and spirits lose their hue,\nThe sun and moon their luster,\nCreation its authority,\nYin and yang their order,\nDemons and fiends flee their traces,\nAll beings vanish—\nAll from this *yi*.\n\nWithin the Three Realms, *yi* alone reigns supreme.\nRelease it, and it exists;\nWithdraw it, and it vanishes.\nAt will, it expands or contracts—\nNothing exceeds this *yi*.\n\n*Yuanqi* (元始) as ancestral breath,\n*Fangong* (梵空) as sacred essence,\n*Taishang* (太上) as true breath,\n*Haoji* (浩气) as boundless breath,\n*Yuanqi* (元气) as condensed and harmonious breath,\n*Yangqi* (阳气) as compassionate and benevolent breath,\n*Yinqi* (阴气) as harsh and punitive breath,\n*Xueqi* (血气) as violent and unrestrained breath,\n*Yeqi* (邪气) as licentious, murderous, thieving, and false,\n*Mogui* (魔气) as obstinate and obstructive,\n*Yaogui* (妖气) as cruel and dark,\n*Yuangui* (怨气) as oppressive and vengeful—\nAll arise from the **Assemblage!**\n\nIf the body does not take refuge in the Teacher-Jewel,\nIt will run wild with ferocity.\nIf the mind does not take refuge in the Scriptural-Jewel,\nIt will be mired in confusion and darkness.\nIf *yi* does not take refuge in the Dao-Jewel,\nIt will be entangled in myriad difficulties.\n\nWhen *yi* is partial and insincere,\nIt loses the center—\nWithout the center, wisdom’s light does not shine,\n*Ding*’s power is not firm,\nPrecepts are not strictly upheld,\nThe spirit cannot condense,\nThe *qi* cannot gather,\nThe essence cannot transform.\n\nThus, the body cannot be refined,\nThe mind cannot be still,\nAnd *yi* cannot be sincere.\n\n**Assemblage!**\nNow I reveal the Great Dao,\nPointing directly to the human mind.\nIf you do not swiftly subdue the body, mind, and *yi*,\nTransforming them into the true bodies of the Three Jewels,\nAnd escape the cycle of rebirth,\nThen even after taking refuge in the world’s enlightened teachers and scriptures,\nYou will have wasted this chance to leave home for good.\n\nIf there are those who uphold the Three Great Methods of precepts, *ding*, and wisdom,\nWith firm and unwavering faith,\nAnd do not waver or regret,\nThen know—\nThis person will certainly attain the Dao.»\n\n「Even a slight deviation,\nUnable to adhere,\nAnd one’s own self slackness—\nKnow that this person\nHas deep faults and scant virtue,\nCannot fathom the Dao,\nIs rejected by heavenly deities,\nHow could they hear the peerless, supreme,\nMost authentic, tranquil, and emancipating Way?\n\nWhen encountering such individuals,\nBe cautious not to scold or reproach,\nInstead cultivate compassion,\nFlexibility and expedient means,\nSkillfully guide them to the Dao—\nThis is called taking refuge in the Three Jewels.\n\nThus, the precept disciples and others bowed in homage and took refuge,\nAnd composed the following hymn:\n*\"The Great Dao is pure and void, beyond all naming,\nThrough scriptures its subtle mysteries are revealed in words.\nIf not for the Teacher’s exposition of the fundamental principles,\nHow could the muddled and deluded ever attain clarity?\nClarity, unbroken, is called Perfect Truth,\nPerfectly grasping the True Essence, escaping life and death.\nThe enlightened and compassionate know well—\nEndlessly guiding the virtuous to the path.\"*\n\n**Threefold Confessions of Faults**\n\nGreat Assembly!\nHaving already taken refuge in the Three Jewels,\nOne must follow and uphold the wondrous conduct.\n\nThe *Tàishàng* says:\n*\"Misfortune and fortune have no gates,\nOnly summoned by oneself.\nThe retribution of good and evil,\nFollows like shadow to form.\"*\n\nTherefore, the deities of Heaven and Earth,\nWho oversee transgressions,\nMeasure one’s crimes by their gravity,\nAnd shorten one’s lifespan accordingly.\nIf the faults are trifling—\nEven hundreds of petty deeds—\nThose who seek longevity must first avoid them.\nFaults are the transgressions themselves.\n\nNow, practitioners of cultivation,\nWho obscure their true nature,\nDeceive their own essence,\nSee only others’ faults,\nYet fail to recognize their own errors—\nThis very ignorance of one’s own faults,\nAlready makes the guilt profound,\nAnd the karma heavy indeed.\n\nTo deceive oneself and obscure the truth,\nHow could such a one enter the Dao?\nThus, confession is necessary.\nConfession means:\nWith humble reverence before the Sacred and Authentic,\nDaring not to conceal past wrongs,\nSolemnly vowing to avoid repeating them—\nOnly then can one advance.\n\nI do not shy from scolding or blame,\nNow I plainly reveal to the world\nThose who deceive themselves and obscure the truth.\nGreat Assembly, all listen well,\nAnd you shall understand.\n\nNow I speak of what constitutes self-deception and obscuring the truth:\nWith lofty rhetoric in their mouths,\nYet greedy for wealth and covetous of gain;\nExternally feigning piety,\nInternally scheming with deceitful plots;\nTaking precepts yet not abiding by their laws,\nUrging others without fear of their own faults;\nClaiming to be Daoists in public,\nYet secretly consorting with the depraved;\nSpeaking falsely in assemblies,\nAnd in public affairs always justifying themselves;\nHearing the Dao yet failing to practice it,\nKnowing the Dharma yet deliberately transgressing;\nUsing clever stratagems to deceive the simple,\nAnd seizing advantage as their foundation;\nHabitually stirring up ignorance,\nAnd often acting stubbornly;\nTreating non-being as being,\nAnd being as non-being;\nPassing off falsehood as truth,\nAnd truth as falsehood;\nPointing to a deer as a horse,\nOr selling a dog while hanging a sheep;\nActing dishonest in secret,\nAnd committing villainy under broad daylight;\nConcealing malice in their smiles,\nAnd harboring knives in their laughter.\n\nAll manner of perverse deeds,\nEach and every one contrary to the Dao,\nYet none know their own faults.\nThe ignorant and foolish,\nThe deluded and reckless,\nDo not know—\nBut those who know yet deliberately transgress,\nAre called *evil and petty men.\nIs this not self-deception and obscuring the truth?\n\nSuch offenders’ faults and karma\nAre deeper and heavier than those of the ignorant and foolish.\nWhy so?\nThe ignorant and foolish,\nLacking wisdom,\nAct in error without knowing—\nThey can only harm themselves,\nNot others,\nAnd if they harm others,\nThey are ultimately harmed by others.\n\nBut *evil men\nAre treacherous and cunning,\nDamaging others to benefit themselves,\nAnd deceiving themselves to fool their own minds.\nThey seek to make Heaven and Earth unaware of their faults,\nAnd the deities and spirits ignorant of their wickedness.\nThrough clever illusions and contrivances,\nThey always cloak their actions in excuses;\nWith deep scheming and hidden plots,\nThey bend and twist to cover their tracks.\nThey set traps for others,\nYet no one perceives their snares;\nThey push others into wells,\nYet no one can trace who dug the pit.\n\nSuch people exist in abundance in this world—\nYet cultivation cannot prevail against them.»\n\nBefore taking refuge in the Three Jewels,\nIf one harbored such thoughts,\nNow that one has received the precepts,\nLet them swiftly change and amend,\nSeeking repentance without delay.\n\nOf late, the vital *yuan* wind has faltered,\nPrecepts and disciplines have slackened,\nThe Dao’s transformative power has waned,\nYellow-crowned monks have strayed from teaching—\nAgain and again, those who claim instruction\nHave frequently violated precepts and transgressed rules.\n\nI now spare no effort in earnest admonition,\nUrging the assembly with solemn warnings.\nNot only must the karmic debts of countless past aeons be repented,\nNor only the sins owed to one’s parents across many lives—\nEven the debts to one’s present parents and seven ancestral generations must be atoned.\nSwiftly, with deepest resolve, purify the mind of past transgressions.\nAll unrighteous delusions,\nEvery slightest stray thought—\nMust be confessed in their entirety,\nRegretted in their fullness,\nOnly then may one attain the Dao’s essence.\nOtherwise, it is like covering ears to steal a bell—\nHow could one hope for liberation?\nThe Great Way lies distant!\n\nNow I compose this repentance and aspiration text,\nThat the assembly may recite it morning and evening.\n\n**Text of Repentance and Aspiration**\n\nWe, the disciples of the assembly,\nFrom the moment of receiving the precepts\nUntil this very day,\nHave merely indulged in the hollow name of precept-taking,\nYet failed to uphold its true practice.\n\nOur robes and bowls are tarnished by pretension,\nTransmitted in vain.\nWe could not strive earnestly for the first truth,\nNor avoid the depths of grave offenses.\nLacking wisdom, we dared not question the enlightened teacher;\nOur nature obscured by ignorance, we struggled to endure hardship among equals.\nOur hearts narrow and constrained, unable to embrace compassion;\nOur minds twisted and perverse, leading to repeated transgressions.\nWe mistook illusion for truth,\nFailed to discern causes and effects,\nConfusing thieves for sons.\nWe deemed the virtuous as outcasts—\nTruth and falsehood became indistinguishable.\nWe took the noble for the base,\nUnable to discern right from wrong.\nAt times, we misappropriated offerings meant for merit,\nSquandering alms into private coffers;\nAt times, we recited scriptures with garbled words,\nOur minds entirely detached from their meaning.\nAt times, we were stirred by fleeting beauty before our eyes,\nOur lustful roots aroused;\nAt times, we heard sacred teachings yet harbored doubt within.\nEndless corrupt deeds have cast us into the depths of mundanity.\nIf we do not now reform,\nWhen the day of reckoning comes, we shall find ourselves at life’s end,\nDoomed to sink like a stone into the sea’s depths.\nIf we persist in reckless ways,\nOnly when the hourglass runs out shall we realize the terrors of the sword-trees and knife-mountains.\n\nThus, we now, with feigned incense, lamps, and water offerings,\nPledge our bodies, our spirits, our very lives in sincerity.\nAt every moment, we humbly turn toward the celestial heights,\nSeeking to preserve our fate;\nMorning and evening, we earnestly aspire toward the golden palace,\nOffering our devotion with utmost sincerity.\nThrough fasting and purification, we strive with unwavering piety,\nUndeterred by toil and hardship.\nWe now turn back to seek the mercy of our teacher,\nSetting forth offerings in supplication to the Heavenly Judge.\n\nFrom this day forth, let all evils be utterly abandoned,\nAnd may one forever become a person of virtue and goodness.\nHenceforth, let one strive with vigor to serve the True One,\nAnd earnestly uphold the precepts of the Original Truth.\n\nShould one transgress these laws again,\nIn life, one shall suffer heavenly retribution;\nIn death, one shall fall into the *Fengdu* abyss.\nIf one violates the decrees of the Sun’s judgment,\nIn daylight, one shall endure the utmost punishment;\nIn darkness, one shall be buried in the *Wujian* pit.\n\nYet may it be that after repentance,\nGuilt be extinguished and blessings arise,\nCalamities dispersed and misfortunes released,\nAs ice melts and enlightenment dawns,\nAnd the obscured moon regains its radiance.\nThe darkened lacquer chamber restored to clarity,\nThe wisdom-sun shining through the night;\nThe sprouts of goodness growing anew,\nSweet dew nourishing the withered branches.\n\nMay the boundless compassion of the Original Dao’s renewal\nAnd the law’s abundant rain revive all things with its grace.\nThus may one’s black records be erased,\nAnd one’s name inscribed upon the celestial tablets.\n\nThrough profound cultivation and steadfastness,\nMay the True Body be preserved and secured.\nThe eight consciousnesses diminished,\nA hundred obstacles and myriad demons cleansed away;\nThe three lifetimes illuminated,\nAscending on the nine clouds to the seven ancestors.\n\nMay the divine wind carry far,\nAnd the ten thousand *qi* currents flourish.\nLet the lineage’s teachings flourish grandly,\nAnd its branches extend from the ancestral seat.\n\nIn both action and concealment, may fortune unfold,\nAnd in seclusion and revelation, may peace prevail—\nAs the sun and moon rest within the caldron.\nMay teacher and disciples study together,\nRelatives and kin of the lineage,\nAll beings of the earth and the heavens’ devotees,\nEach heart enlightened, each nature radiant with clarity.\n\nMay the seasons be harmonious, the winds gentle,\nThe land prosperous, the people at ease.\nMay arms lay down, and water and fire find balance.\nMay the imperial plans be fortified,\nThe sovereign’s rule extend in splendor.\nMay the august emperor’s reign endure,\nAnd ministers be virtuous and wise.\nMay all the people unite in sincerity,\nAnd the myriad realms rejoice in the Dao.\n\nTogether with all living beings,\nMay all return to purity and tranquility.\n\nHumbly, we pray for the sacred mercy\nTo descend in salvation and deliverance.\n\nAbove, the **Confession and Aspiration Text** is to be recited devoutly morning and evening.\nOne must, with one’s own **Dharmakāya**, before the **Emperor of Heaven**, in every thought, surrender sincerely—\nwith every heartfelt remorse, each utterance clear and resonant,\neach syllable repented with trembling resolve,\nand press forward with fierce, unwavering determination.\n\nLife and death, existence and annihilation,\nsuffering, hardship, hunger, and cold—\nall must be relinquished without hesitation.\nOnly by holding fast to **precepts and concentration** shall one secure one’s path forward.\n\n---\n**Scripture of the Jade Terrace, Volume Four: On Severing Obstacles**\nFor those who practice, if obstacles are not severed,\nthey are blocked and plunged into darkness.\nIf hindrances are not removed,\nthey remain dull and obscured.\n\nThe true nature of the mind is as boundless as heaven and earth,\nyet deluded emotions drift like fleeting clouds.\nWhen mist shrouds the azure sky, how can the sun’s brilliance shine?\nWhen passions cloud the sacred faculties, how can the true principle unfold?\nIs this not the great affliction of the practitioner?\n\nNow I reveal the root of these obstacles.\nThe **Dao** speaks of two kinds: **obstacles of principle** and **obstacles of action**.\nIf one does not grasp their nature, truth and falsehood cannot be distinguished;\nif one does not grasp their essence, right and wrong cannot be discerned.\nIf one clings to principle while neglecting action, one becomes rigid and dull—\nthis is the **obstacle of principle** in the heart.\nIf one acts while harming principle, one becomes perverse and distorted—\nthis is the **obstacle of action**, corrupting one’s nature.\nWhether in principle or action, any attachment becomes an obstacle.\n\nNow I explain these two terms in detail.\nHonored assembly, countless scriptures and teachings exist,\nall from the enlightened and wise of old,\nseeking to guide later generations\nto do good and learn virtue,\nto awaken to the **Dao** and cultivate the true self.\nYet beings do not do good but instead do evil,\ndo not learn virtue but instead learn vice,\ndo not cultivate the true but instead feign it,\ndo not awaken to the **Dao** but instead betray it—\nthis is the **obstacle of action** in one’s original nature.\n\nAgain, there are monastic practitioners\nwho do good yet cling to goodness,\nlearn virtue yet cling to virtue,\ncultivate the true yet fixate on its form,\nawaken to the **Dao** yet become ensnared by its traces—\nall because they have not transcended their attachments.\nThis is called the **obstacle of principle** in one’s original nature.\n\nYet even these two—obstacles of principle and action—\nare still afflictions of those striving upward.\nThere is another kind of practitioner\nwhose mind remains unenlightened,\nwhose divine potential has not yet turned.\nWherever they go, obstacles arise.\nSeeing those who strive upward\npreach scriptures or uphold precepts,\nthey may outwardly praise them\nwhile secretly stirring **delusion**,\ngenerating an **obstacle of the heart** and **deluded thoughts**.\n\nHonored assembly, if this **obstacle of the heart** is not severed,\nhow can one escape the sea of suffering?\nThough there are boats and rafts,\nsails and oars—\nthough the path across the sea is clear—\none still does not dare to cross, cannot cross.\nWhy is this?\n\nIt is because this **obstacle of the heart**\nis like a sudden storm cloud rising in the sky,\ndarkening all before it,\nthreatening wind and rain,\nsummoning monstrous waves and fierce tides—\nthus one does not dare to cross, cannot cross.\n\nHonored assembly, the sea of suffering is boundless,\nbut turning back is the shore.\nThe practitioner’s obstacles\nare like black clouds surging upward,\na deceitful omen concealing the heavens.\nOnly when they are severed\ndoes the sea grow calm, the winds still,\nand one attains ease and freedom—\nthen, and only then, can one cross to the other shore.\n\nHave you not heard it said in the *Scripture of the Highest Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct*?\n*\"Because beings bear heavy obstacles,\nthey cannot behold the Emperor’s merciful countenance.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"All these obstacles—\nyou must each sever them.\"*\n\nThus the **Imperial Scripture** begins by proclaiming the severing of obstacles.\nThe method to sever them is to cultivate **great wisdom**,\nto abandon all doubt, all greed and anger,\nall lust, all jealousy and malice,\nall worldly thoughts and worldly musings,\nall dullness and filth,\nall attachment to sounds and forms,\nall quarrels of right and wrong,\nall hatred and love,\nall discrimination,\nall arrogance and fixation.\n\nConcentrate the spirit, purify the mind—\nlet all passions submit.\nLet the heart be as boundless space,\npure within and without.\nReceive all without exclusion,\nadmit all without resistance.\nDo not let external evils disrupt the **True Path**,\nlure you from the **True Teaching**,\ncorrupt your **sacred root**,\nor steal your **precious essence**.\nOtherwise, you shall for ten thousand kalpas\nsink into the mundane realm,\nfall into the snares of the world,\nbe assailed by myriad demons,\nsuffer countless kalpas without hearing the **wonderful dharma**,\nbe punished by ghosts and spirits,\nand wander from birth to death.\n\nTherefore, you must resolve with determination\nto safeguard the **True Teaching**,\nlest it be lost.\nAs previously stated,\neach must sever these obstacles—\nfor these are the very conditions of **obstacles**.\n\nIf they are not severed,\nthe six senses will be defiled,\nthe three actions will ensnare you,\nand you shall never attain **tranquility**.\nIf you do not attain **tranquility**,\nhow can you behold the Emperor’s merciful countenance?\nHow can you attain the **Seventeen Radiant Lights** or the **Thirty Virtues**?\n\nFor the Emperor’s radiant virtues and merits\nare the domain of all **Buddhas and Holy Teachers**,\nthe **Imperial Masters of Heaven**.\nThe **three volumes and five categories** of wondrous scriptures\nall arise from severing obstacles.\n\nHonored assembly, the obstacles of the world are countless.\nThe **Imperial Scripture** merely outlines their general forms,\nso you may grasp their essence and understand the **Dao’s** path.\n\nYou must realize:\nthe subtle obstacles of the world\nare myriad and countless—\nevery thought, every impulse,\ntoo numerous to enumerate.\nFor instance, when reading scriptures or reciting texts,\ntheir profound meanings are deep and hidden.\nSince your own wisdom is limited,\nyou cannot fathom them—\nthus you know your **mind’s faculties** are not yet awakened,\nyour **wisdom-light** is still dim.\n\nYet you refuse to humble yourself,\nto question the enlightened—\nthis is **filth**.\nAnd when you do ask,\nyou still harbor doubts,\nfearing the speaker’s words may not be true.\nYou question another,\nyet their answers differ—\nyour heart fills with vexation,\nbranching into countless contradictions.\nIs this not an **obstacle**?\n\nAgain, if you study with companions,\nand they recite fluently while you lag behind,\nyour mind grows agitated—\nis this not an **obstacle**?\n\nAgain, if my companions are skilled while I am not,\nI grow elated—\nis this not an **obstacle**?\n\nAgain, if I possess talent while others are dull,\nI take pride in deceiving them—\nis this not an **obstacle**?\n\nAgain, when I see others practice virtue—\nwhether in giving, or in meritorious deeds—\nif they are rich while I am poor,\nI harbor resentment;\nif I am rich while they are destitute,\nI swell with arrogance—\nis this not an **obstacle**?\n\nAgain, when reading scriptures,\nsuddenly grasping a truth,\ndimly illuminating its principle,\nI cling to it as absolute,\nthen teach it to others—\nyet they surpass me in insight,\nand my heart refuses to submit—\nis this not an **obstacle**?\n\nAgain, if I fixate on heard truths,\ngrasping only one perspective,\nunable to adapt—\nis this not an **obstacle**?\n\nAgain, in meditation,\nencountering fleeting insight,\nI boast of my attainment—\nis this not an **obstacle**?\n\nAgain, when studying with companions under a teacher,\nthe teacher declares their understanding surpasses mine,\nyet I blame them instead of reflecting on myself—\nis this not an **obstacle**?\n\nAnd when death approaches,\nclinging to even a single coin—\nall attachments,\ngreed, and indulgence,\nunbroken, unsevered—\nwhether in love of music, books,\nchess, or painting—\nall are **obstacles**.\n\nSome cling to talismans as divine power,\nothers dismiss them as crude arts—\nwhen one approves and the other scorns,\nthis too is an **obstacle**.\n\nAssembly,\nif you seek liberation,\nto escape the wheel of rebirth,\nyou must cultivate the **Dao** of the transcendent,\nnurture the practice of the world-transcending.\nThese **obstacles** are but snares\nthat block the **Dao’s** luminous gate,\nand delusions that cloud the radiant nature.\n\nHow then can you attain liberation?\n\nIf you resolve to sever each tangled root,\ndispel all distractions,\ncleanse the mind to boundless openness—\nthen clarity flows freely,\nendless and luminous,\nand wisdom arises spontaneously.\nThe natural essence shines forth,\nrevealing the harmony of life and death,\nof heaven and humanity.\n\nEffortless, beyond recognition—\n*Ha!*\n\n**Obstacles, obstacles!**\nThey lie only in whether the assembly can sever or cannot sever them.\n\nThen the Dharma Master expounded thus:\n*\"When humility begins, the command of life is not in vain.\nIlluminating the spirit’s hallowed ground, no speck can obscure it.\nOnce the chest opens to boundless clarity,\nthe vision clears and stands firm.\"*\n\nThe afflictions of the Five Aggregates are severed—\nAssembly, the harm of **obstacles** you now know.\nYet the harm of **affectionate attachments** is far more severe.\nHow do you see this?\n\nThe harm of **obstacles** arises only when met with circumstances;\nwhen circumstances pass, it vanishes—\nits harm comes and goes in fleeting moments.\n\nAs for the two characters **\"affectionate attachments\" (爱缘)**,\nthey are the karmic roots sown from the beginningless kalpas\neven unto this very life.\nThus, sages, immortals, and Buddhas alike\nonly urge beings: *\"Do not cling to forms,\ndo not bind yourselves,\ndo not indulge in craving.\"*\nIn the scriptures of the Three Teachings,\nthey all exhort all under heaven, generation after generation,\nnot to be ensnared by **affectionate attachments**.\n\nThis **affectionate attachment** is the progenitor of all demons,\nthe root of ten thousand harms.\nThrough countless kalpas, it has plunged beings into delusion,\ncausing them to fall again and again—\nall due to **affectionate attachment**.\nThe path to liberation is not found,\nthe truth of emptiness is not understood—\nall because of **affectionate attachment**.\nTo suffer punishment in life,\nto sink into hell in death—\nall because of **affectionate attachment**.\nTo perish in floods or flames,\nto be slain by calamity or blade—\nall because of **affectionate attachment**.\nTo destroy one’s lineage and vows,\nto violate precepts and transgress rules—\nall because of **affectionate attachment**.\nTo bring ruin upon nine generations,\nto extinguish ancestral rites—\nall because of **affectionate attachment**.\nTo endure aging, sickness, and death,\nto see one’s nature and mind perverted,\none’s body frail,\none’s progress in the Dao/Way and Dharma obstructed—\nall because of **affectionate attachment**.\nTo have the Six Senses impure,\nthe Six Thieves rampant,\nthe Six Consciousnesses discriminating,\nthe Six Realms of rebirth unending—\nall because of **affectionate attachment**.\n\nWithin heaven and earth,\namong the Five Phases,\nin the rise and fall of all things,\nin every birth and decay—\nall because of **affectionate attachment**.\n\nIf you wish to transcend the world,\nto escape life and death,\nto seek neither severance nor abandonment of **affectionate attachments**,\nyet to attain clarity so bright,\npurity so profound,\nliberation so free—\nthis has never been seen.\n\nI now speak of the **affectionate attachments** of laypeople—\nthe ruler’s subjects, father’s children, husband’s wife,\nbrothers, friends, and kin—\nas the ancients have already described:\nthe Five *Yǒu* (有), Five *Zhǐ* (止), and Five *Pì* (僻),\nas well as the virtues of harmonious growth,\nfilial piety, and honoring the worthy.\nAll these arise from the very essence of that **affectionate attachment**,\nwhich, when properly ordered,\nbrings the cosmos into unity with the *Tàihé* (太和).\nMingling with the primordial *qi*,\nno **affectionate attachment** remains to be abandoned or severed—\nthe pure Dao/Way of natural tranquility and liberation\nI will speak of gradually.\n\nNow I speak only of those who have left home—\nthat is, the lay devotees gathered here today—\nand urge you to discard all extraneous **affectionate attachments**.\nAs for those within your proper sphere,\ndo not love what may be loved,\nbut examine all **affectionate attachments** that seem to have limits,\none by one, and restrain them.\nAssembly, you are utterly unaware of the delusion **affectionate attachments** bring.\nHow do I say this?\nThe mind’s impulse to delight—\nthis is **affectionate attachment**.\nAll coarse and fine, great and small things;\nall distant and near, relatives and acquaintances—\n\n「All affairs of inner and outer defilements, errors, and right/wrong distinctions;\nall teachings of the sages and the three *Dao* traditions—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism—*dharma* and methods of the *sutras*, scriptures, literary works, and music;\nall subtle principles of Heaven and Earth, *yin* and *yang*, creation and transformation;\nall marvelous techniques of divine and extraordinary *qi* and illusory phenomena;\nall paths of Pure Clarity, Spiritual Treasure, and Perfect Truth—Daoists of the highest refinement.\n\nEven the sacred mountains and hidden grottoes,\nthe celestial palaces and holy realms,\nthe seven treasures and eight delicacies,\nthe River Chart and Tortoise Scriptures—\nand one’s own body and mind: the five *zàng* organs and six *fǔ* viscera,\nthe teeth and tongue, vital *qi* and essence,\nthe rivers and mountains, the vast earth,\nthe grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and insects—\nif they are the objects of one’s craving,\nthe focus of one’s intentions,\nthe subject of one’s thoughts,\nthe convergence of one’s spirit-*qi*,\nthe longing of one’s emotions,\nthe delight of one’s nature,\nthe desires of one’s mouth,\nthe pleasures of one’s body,\nthe wanderings of one’s dreams—\nall these are **affectionate attachments**.\n\nA single lingering thought\nbrings entanglement and distraction,\npreventing one from attaining the Dao/Way of pure tranquility and liberation,\ndooming one to perpetual immersion in sorrow and suffering.\n\nAssembly, when lost in delusion, **affectionate attachments** arise;\nwhen awakened, they cease.\nYou must cultivate awareness at every moment,\ntake responsibility in every instant—\nfor even the slightest trace of attachment in the heart,\nall must be abandoned immediately,\nand the cycle of *pratītyasamutpāda* must not be allowed to persist.\n\nIf one delights in sleep, one must sit;\nif one delights in sitting, one must walk.\nIf one delights in renunciation,\nthe mind and spirit naturally become lively;\nif one delights in emptiness,\nthe spiritual essence naturally becomes void.\n\nNot a thread of clinging remains,\nnor do myriad **affectionate attachments** arise.\nThe awakened one’s heart shines with clarity,\nunmoved by sensory conditions,\nundisturbed by objects,\nunshaken by affairs.\nWith time, one reaches the boundless marvelous state—\nthe primordial orifice opens wide.\n\nIf today you do not eliminate them,\ntomorrow you do not sever them,\nif you abandon yet do not cut them off,\nthey still ensnare you.\nThen even your robes, alms bowl, and meditation cushion\nbecome nets of delusion;\nyour straw sandals and bamboo staff\nturn into bonds of illusion;\nsacred mountains and holy realms\nare but prisons;\nteacher and fellow Daoists\nbecome adversaries.\n\nEven the incantations and true words\nbecome poisonous arsenic;\nthe innate Dao-heart\nis transformed into the fate of a *mara*-like demon of retribution.\n\nIs this not a warning?\nIs this not a cause for pain?\nIs this not a matter of resolute abandonment?\n\nOnce there was a Daoist recluse\nwho sat long and his spirit manifested.\nHe saw a radiant light atop his head,\nfive-colored and vivid,\nlike clouds or brocade.\nWithin that light,\nmountains, rivers, and the vast earth,\nall things were visible.\nThe recluse rejoiced in his heart,\nbelieving he had attained the boundless light of the Supreme Sage.\nDay and night he sat upright,\nfixating on the thought of light,\nand the light no longer appeared.\nThe recluse, unaware that the illusory realm was not true,\nfocused his intentions and meditations,\nforgetting all else,\nonly contemplating the luminous clarity.\nHis fixation endured for days,\nuntil he became dull and senseless,\nhis form rigid as wood and clay.\nOthers thought he had entered the highest Dao.\nHe sat in meditation for six years,\nhis *qi* condensed, his form altered,\nyet he remained unaware.\n\nOne day, his breath grew coarse,\nhis pulse frantic.\nHis companions, watching over him,\nonly hoped he would emerge from his trance\nso they might continue their practice.\nAmong them, one *chúshī*—a disciplined practitioner—\nknew he was possessed by a demon.\nAt midnight,\nthe recluse in his meditative state\nsuddenly flung his hands as if in flight.\nThe others, with lamps, incense, and flowers,\noffered reverence and worship.\nThe recluse then expired,\nand from his mouth flew a moth,\nwhich struck the lamp’s flame and perished.\nThe disciplined practitioner took it\nand declared to the assembly of Daoists:\n“This is the body of the Daoist\nwho fixated on the luminous light—\nhis **affectionate attachment** to light\nmade him one with the moth.\nWhen **affectionate attachments** reach their limit,\nthe form transforms into another kind.\nIf **affectionate attachments** are not eliminated,\nall will meet this fate.\nIs this not pitiful?\nIs this not a cause for severance?”\n\nAssembly, when the heart has attachments,\nthey are **affectionate attachments**.\n**Affectionate attachments** arise from delight,\ndelight follows **affectionate attachments**,\n**affectionate attachments** and delight entwine,\nwith no end in sight.\nFather becomes son,\nancestor turns into grandson,\nmale shifts to female,\nfaces and forms change,\nnames and surnames swap,\nand ordinary beings are turned upside down,\ntaken for reality—\nterrifying and pitiable!\n\nAssembly, know this well.\nObserve the Six Precepts with utmost precision.»\n\n「Aspiring practitioners, having already severed love and cast aside **affectionate attachments**, earnestly seek liberation from the world to escape the cycle of birth and death. If **affectionate attachments** are not extinguished and lustful desires resurge, then this heart remains ensnared as before, again falling into the nets and pits of bondage—forever without deliverance.\n\nOne must, before any signs appear, take preemptive measures to guard against them. Otherwise, all prior efforts will be in vain, and future obstacles from demonic forces will be unavoidable.\n\nThus, the ancient sages of the Dao/Way confined the heart to **precepts**. This **precept**—\nis the pestle to subdue demons, able to crush malevolent spirits;\nis the talisman to safeguard life, able to prolong fortune and longevity;\nis the ladder to ascend the heavens, able to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones and transcend the mundane to attain sainthood;\nis the guiding lamp, able to dispel the Six Desires and pierce through darkness and delusion;\nis the celestial vessel and precious raft, able to ferry all beings away from the sea of suffering;\nis the compassionate ferry and bridge, able to rescue all beings from the river of **affectionate attachments**.\n\nIt is indeed the safeguard of the practitioner and the outline for advancing the Dao/Way. The path to the Dao/Way has no gate—all enter through **precepts**; the way of the sage has no road—all proceed through observance of **precepts**.\n\nIn truth, it is the vital thoroughfare for the Dao/Way’s adept and the direct path for the wise.\n\nAssembly, since the **karmic seeds** of your past lives have brought you to hear the **precepts** in this life, you have encountered an immense fortune. If you fail to uphold the **precepts** with utmost precision, diligent effort, and steadfast perseverance, this immense fortune will become an immense sin.\n\nThese **precepts** are the fundamental prohibitions of the Primordial Capital, the ordinances established by the Primordial Beginning’s Sacred Treasure, the Supreme Sovereign. They are the regulations constantly enforced by the Lady of the Celestial Azure, attended by divine soldiers and celestial marshals.\n\nThose who honor them are rewarded with **cinnabar talismans** and merit enhancement. Those who violate them are recorded in **black ledgers** and face retribution.»\n\nThe slightest detail must not be overlooked, the finest thread must not be missed.\n\nNow, those who receive the precepts are but ignorant folk. How so? Simply because they do not grasp the principle. If one truly understands this principle, one must uphold the precepts with utmost precision and never violate them. If one transgresses the rules, is that not ignorance?\n\nThus, among the assembly, those who have already taken the precepts must earnestly examine the meaning of *precepts*. How does one practice precepts? Precepts mean restraint—restraint of what? And why did you take them in the first place? If you have come for the precepts, then you must practice them daily. If you do not practice them daily, why take them at all? If your intention is not to uphold the precepts but merely to gain the hollow name of a Daoist—seeking only the robe and bowl of ordination—then you are not truly here for the precepts.\n\nWhy else would you not observe the pure rules? Truly consider this: since the Seven Sages revealed the teachings of the Dao, the transmission of the Way has declined. For four hundred years, the precepts and rituals have not shone forth in the world, for within the teaching there was no one to bear this responsibility. Thus, the luminous lamp of the Dao, meant to illuminate the path, has not been polished. Those who practice walk in darkness, their supporting staff abandoned, their grip lost.\n\nIt is no wonder that heterodox sects flourish across the land, while the pure, tranquil, and enlightened Way of true liberation remains unheard. Now, fortunately, the Dao’s time has come, and we live in an age of prosperity. Above, the Emperor’s blessings protect; below, the land is at peace. The court is filled with virtuous officials who uphold the faith, and within the teaching, protectors of the law stand firm.\n\nAgain, there are lay devotees who make offerings—clothing, robes, and alms bowls—crafted and ready for use. This is a rare fortune, a chance encounter across lifetimes, all stemming from your past karmic connections.\n\nSince you have received the precepts, you must now earnestly seek the meaning of *戒* (precepts). How does one call this *戒*?\n\nAlas, those who take the precepts differ in wisdom and folly. The foolish may begin with sincere intentions, but once they receive the precepts, they abandon their original resolve in darkness, failing to uphold the discipline. How tragic to see the purity of their initial vow—those sacred robes, that ceremonial scarf—cast into the Eastern Sea, sold, repurposed into common garments, or patched into sleeves. They profane the divine, defiling the sacred hall. They turn the pure alms bowl into an incense burner, storing money or rice within. They break their fasts, violate their vows, drink wine, eat meat without restraint, extinguishing their wisdom and severing their path to transcendence.\n\nThere are living cases to prove this. Once, a monk destroyed his precepts, defiled the *戒经* (Precept Scripture), sold his robes and alms bowl, then died suddenly. Ghostly officers seized him with chains. In the underworld, he saw a grand hall, its doors flanked by ranks of ghostly officers, binding countless former companions—all broken preceptists who had died in their transgressions.\n\nThe monk trembled and asked, *\"How did you come here?\"*\nThe others replied, *\"We do not know why, but we have all gathered here, one after another.\"*\n\nAbove the gate hung a plaque: *考对司* (Examination Bureau). He asked the ghostly officers, *\"What is this Examination Bureau?\"*\nThey answered, *\"This is a newly established heavenly decree. There are two judicial halls overseeing monastic and Daoist precepts. Whoever in the mortal world takes the precepts has their name recorded by the Earth Deities. On this day, they received the precepts; on that day, they upheld them with merit; on another, they committed offenses. This one violated the precepts, that one betrayed the Dao and defied the teacher. This one sold his robes, that one defiled his bowl. This one slandered the precept masters, that one harmed donors. This one was greedy, that one indulged in lust—all recorded in detail. Each month, the records are submitted to the respective bureaus for examination. Only after passing this bureau’s scrutiny may one proceed to other halls. Those who uphold the precepts with virtue and strict resolve need not appear here. But those like you, who never took the precepts, will first be examined and expelled from the records before your scheduled death is enforced. If you fail this bureau’s review, no other hall will accept you.\"*\n\nListen, fellow preceptists—this monk who died has already returned for half a day, recounting this truth.\n\nYou may criticize others’ faults with clarity, yet when your own failings arise, you turn a blind eye, accumulating sins day by day, granting yourself endless pardons while hiding them—this is called *欺心* (self-deception). Those who have taken the precepts must scrutinize their every thought, word, and deed. If wrong, correct it immediately. Do not excuse yourself. Do not forgive yourself. If you err and have not yet reflected, repent humbly before the Sacred Truth, confessing sincerely according to the *戒经*’s laws. Study diligently with a wise teacher, delving into profound teachings.\n\nRevere your masters as parents, your fellow practitioners as elder brothers, the *dharma* as a beloved spouse, and the scriptures as precious jade. Hold the precepts in your heart as you would an object in your hand—let it slip, and they are lost. The world’s laws punish transgressions with punishment; the heavenly *Dao*’s *女青之律* (Laws of the Azure Maiden) demand retribution.\n\nDo not think the underworld is unseen—life and death unfold within your mind. Do not think the precept deities are hidden—they manifest in your every thought.\n\n*戒行精严* (Precept conduct must be precise and strict):\n- *降心顺道* (Subdue the heart, align with the Way) is called *戒* (precept).\n- *忍耐行持* (Patience and steadfast practice) is called *行* (conduct).\n- *一丝不杂* (Not the slightest impurity) is called *精* (refinement).\n- *一毫不犯* (No transgression, not even a hair’s breadth) is called *严* (strictness).\n- *始终不变* (Unchanging from start to finish) is called *持戒* (upholding precepts).\n- *穷困不移* (Unshaken even in hardship) is called *守戒* (defending precepts).\n\nYou who have taken the precepts—do you even remember the ten essentials of *戒*? To have the name but not the substance is meaningless! Yet there is one teaching to assure you all: *\"Hold fast to the precepts with sincerity.\"*\n\nThis celestial sovereign, by nature, takes compassion for life as his heart, boundless in mercy and salvation for all beings. If one has transgressed the precepts but thereafter repents with genuine sincerity, reaffirms the rules, and strives for utmost strictness and refinement—never daring to offend again—then through such heartfelt contrition, the Heavenly Will itself takes pity and grants absolution, restoring one to the original state.\n\nNow, I have another account of cause and effect for those who break the precepts and then uphold them, to share with all of you.\n\nA monk once confessed: *\"After receiving the precepts, I suddenly fell into calamity. During the fast, I broke my vows, committing every sin imaginable. One night, I dreamed of the Underworld, where I witnessed the judicial proceedings. I saw countless ghostly judges, each holding a paper lantern, arranging incense tables. Soon, the King of Hell emerged from the grand gate, his majesty resembling that of an earthly emperor. I heard the judge report, 'The Heavenly Messenger has arrived—quickly prepare the incense tables to receive the edict, just as in the mortal world.' Then I saw the Heavenly Messenger, a celestial official, wearing a golden lotus crown, draped in a five-cloud crane robe, holding a yellow scroll, and entering inside. The ghosts were barred from following.*\n\n*I, too, wished to enter. A ghostly guard shouted, 'What wandering spirit are you, daring to intrude upon this solemn hall?' Another guard said, 'He looks like a monk in disguise.' The ghost replied, 'The edict clearly states that those who practiced and upheld the precepts may enter in full ceremonial attire upon death—those with radiance enter through the main gate, those with lesser light through the east gate, and those without light are stripped of their monastic name, shackled outside the western gate, and summoned for judgment by their records. But you, monk, have no radiance—just a mass of dark qi, indistinguishable from us. You presume to pass as a monk! Begone, begone!' He seized an iron rod toward me.*\n\n*The monk awoke in terror, remembering it all clearly.\"*\n\nThe monk immediately turned over, descended from the bed, and in haste cleansed his face. He took the pure flame to burn incense, seized with great terror, sorrow, and repentance, he bitterly lamented his past deeds and strictly observed the precepts.\n\nAgain, he dreamed of wandering through the **Yámù** (阎府), returning to the very place he had visited before. He saw the ghostly guards wielding iron rods and chains, rushing forward to ask, *\"What is your esteemed title, and where are you bound?\"* The monk replied, *\"I came here as a wandering ascetic, not daring to disturb the great king. I shall return immediately.\"* The guard said, *\"The great king has a rule: all ascetics of virtue and radiance who pass must first go to the tea hall, sit down, and state their name and register for inspection.\"* The monk answered, *\"I have no official business here, so I shall not stay.\"* He turned to leave, but suddenly found himself outside the realm. Upon waking, he told all this to the assembly.\n\nIn the first dream, he was beaten and scolded by the ghosts; in the second, he knelt to be questioned about his name. This was but one mind’s advance and retreat, yet it met with two different judgments. If not for his repentance and return to his former self, he would have remained as he was. **Seeing spirits as the Dao**, the principle of dark and light is one—why should one fear?\n\nAssembly, time passes swiftly, but the heart must remain radiant. Do not wait for the **impermanence** (無常) to arrive, nor act in the dark halls of the **underworld** (陰司). **Niútóu** (牛頭) offers no refuge, nor does **Màmiàn** (馬面) show mercy. If you have faults, change them swiftly; all depends on the precision of your precepts.\n\nWithin the myriad **dharma** (法) and thousand gates, cultivating the mind is the supreme path. Like an endless sea without shore or edge, follow the **precepts and wisdom** (戒慧) to attain radiance.\n\n**Seven: Enduring Insults and Subduing the Heart**\nThe greatest affliction of the cultivator, the hardest to remove and rectify, is the **anger** (嗔) within. It is not the attachment to *my* form, nor to *others’* form—when the mind of anger stirs, it is called the **fire of ignorance** (無明業火). Among the three poisons, the poison of anger ranks first. If the mind of anger is not extinguished, internally it burns oneself; if angered words are spoken, externally it burns others. It consumes the **soul’s vital gate** (靈關), reducing it to embers; it scorches the **Dharma-body** (法身), destroying it utterly. The six **organs** (六腑) cannot be cleansed, nor the five **viscera** (五臟) harmonized. When one hears insults against oneself, the fire of anger rises from the liver; when fierce winds fan the flames, the very ears that can hear are suddenly shut as if by closed windows and sealed openings. When one sees others insult oneself, the fire of anger springs from the kidneys; when fierce winds fan the flames, the very eyes that can see are suddenly obscured as if by barred doors and blocked paths. Even if the tongue does not speak angry words, the mind surges with vexation, and the gallbladder swells with malicious schemes. One fears neither the gods of heaven and earth, nor the fate of life and death; one does not dread the **oil cauldron** (油鍋) and **sword trees** (劍樹) of the underworld, nor the punishments of beheading, strangulation, or exile. Yet one turns the very tongue that can speak into a source of countless sins.\n\nWhy does this tongue, these ears, these eyes suffer such torment? It is because this **fleshly heart** (肉團心) cannot be subdued, relying on mere **vital breath and blood** (氣血) to act in arrogance and tyranny. When one later attains a tranquil mind, all becomes cold and indifferent.\n\nAssembly, the bodies of all beings in this world are but **clusters of vital breath and blood** (血氣結成). This seed of anger has been planted since the beginningless kalpas; the **fire of ignorance** (無明業火) was sown long ago. Thus, when events align with the heart’s desires, one rejoices. If they do not, one’s joy turns into resentment. When the world’s phenomena clash with the heart’s will, anger arises—this is the root of **endless rebirth** (輪迴). You have left home to seek the **extinction of birth and death** (了生死); if the root of anger persists, the **poisonous dragon** (毒龍) will invade the **heavenly root** (天根). You seek to escape the **worldly net** (世網), yet your **life-force** (性命) is heavy with causes. If this anger and hatred do not cease, it will lead to **vital breath filling the moon’s abyss** (氣填月窟). Nature is inherently good, but anger transforms it into a **poisonous dragon**; habitual anger ignites the fire that consumes the body. Life-force is inherently eternal, but anger turns it into a **fierce tiger**; constant anger breeds **poisonous vital breath**, which, when intense, extinguishes the true self.\n\nIgnorance of birth and death stems from failing to cherish one’s **life-force**; the **life-force** not being established comes from the **fire’s strength**. Thus the six **senses** (六根) cannot be restrained, the limbs tremble in vain, the five **faculties** (五官) fail to function properly, and the **fire of the pores** (毛竅) flares wildly, causing countless harms and shortening life.\n\nAssembly, to extinguish anger, first subdue the **evil thoughts**. What are **evil thoughts**? They are the inability to endure insults. The Great Sage **Confucius** (孔子) taught: *\"Be gentle and yielding in your instruction; do not repay injury with wrongdoing.\"* If the heart cannot endure, and the thought lingers even for a day, one remains a day of evil. How can an evil person enter the **Dao**?\n\nAssembly, those who cannot endure insults have hearts that cannot be subdued. They are like **poisonous dragons** and **fierce tigers**, knowing only how to insult others, never allowing themselves to be insulted. They are **overbearing**, **competitive**, and **boastful**, demanding attention before others, acting in tyranny, and speaking harshly. They **sell their heroism**, **pose as mighty warriors**, **covet gain and flaunt reputation**, **boast of their strength and oppress the weak**, **disdain the elderly and bully the young**. Though sometimes they act with **zeal for others**, they do not realize that such actions can save people as easily as they can destroy them.\n\nSince beings are deluded and do not awaken, how could they ever consider the distant consequences? The **Heavenly Path** (天道) is far-reaching; grudges and resentments never dissolve—all comes from the **unbroken root of anger**.\n\nAnger seeks only to insult others; it cannot bear to be insulted itself. One does not realize that **being insulted by others** and **insulting others** are vastly different.\n\nAssembly, the meaning of **insult** (辱) is vast. If one defiles another’s wife or concubine, one does not consider the insult to her husband, her children, her ancestors, or her entire clan. But when others defile *your* wife or concubine, anger arises, and great evil follows. One thinks: *\"How could this person defile my wife or concubine? Where is my dignity now? If others know, it is not just me who will be shamed—my parents’ and ancestors’ **virtue and merit** (功德), my children’s and descendants’ **family reputation** (門風), will all be ruined and destroyed. How can I let this pass?\"*\n\nThen one immediately seizes knives and clubs, kindles rage, and stirs murderous intent—no longer considering that *he* insulted *me*, yet *I* repay him thus.\n\nI did not insult him—how then could he insult me? If in this life my wife and daughters are defiled by others, it is certain that in a past life I committed evil deeds. In a former existence, I defiled others’ wives and daughters, so in this life my own are defiled. This is the cause and effect inherent in humanity.\n\nYou all must heed these words and never stir the heart of lust. I speak plainly to the assembly: the lives of these people all arise from lust. As long as lustful desire is not eradicated, the root of birth and death remains unsevered.\n\nBecause of lust, the colored body exists. To escape the colored body, one must purge desire. Once desire is extinguished, within the perishable colored body, the Dharma-body emerges—only then can one transcend birth and death. These are our true words; do not dismiss them as idle chatter.\n\nRecently, there was a monk under precepts, a man who in daily life held deep Dao-practice, yet suddenly one day he went to solicit alms-food and passed by a rice shop.\n\nThe shopkeeper’s master took delight in the Dao and joyfully invited the precept-holder inside, seating him in the central hall. He bowed and offered alms, then placed a small portion of broken rice—a single *qian*—into the alms bowl. As the precept-holder prepared to leave the hall, he suddenly encountered the shopkeeper’s wife passing through the corridor. Their eyes met; she could not avoid him, and the precept-holder declined the alms and departed.\n\nThat night, while meditating, his mind wandered to the wife. He imagined her face, and in his reverie, he arose, knelt before the incense altar, confessed his transgression, and lay down again. Suddenly, he felt himself dying, reborn into the womb, growing into a man who took a wife—fair of face, harmonious in union. Walking along the road, he saw a Daoist begging for alms, and his heart rejoiced. He brought the Daoist home, offered alms as merit, and called his wife to meet him, bowing in submission.\n\nTurning, he saw the Daoist gesture toward his wife, and his anger flared instantly. He rushed into the kitchen, seized a cleaver, and lunged to strike the Daoist. His foot caught, he stumbled awake—seething with rage—only to realize it was a dream, his body drenched in sweat. Reflecting on the Daoist’s face, it was the rice-shop owner who had given alms; the wife was the one he had encountered in the corridor.\n\n**Assembly**, this precept-holder, though newly practicing, had firm precepts but unstable concentration. Thus, day and night his thoughts wandered, and delusive visions arose, deepening into dreamlike illusions.\n\nAnother practitioner, steadfast in precepts, had never spoken falsely, nor let his mind stray. Though insulted, he harbored no resentment; though struck, he did not retaliate; though reviled, he offered no reply. He only reflected on his own faults, never blaming others. One day, carrying a burden along the road, he encountered a galloping donkey. He stepped aside, but the donkey reared, striking him with its head. He could not evade it and fell to the ground. The donkey bit his clothes, tearing them before trotting away.\n\nThat night, as he meditated, his mind grew hazy. Suddenly, a white-clad figure appeared, bowing and saying, *“I am the donkey that struck you on the road. In a past life, we had unresolved karmic debt. Now that debt is released, and we are both freed from suffering. From this life onward, we shall be reborn among humans. I come to tell you: on the *such-and-such* day of the next month, meet me at *such-and-such* place to aid your liberation.”* With these words, the figure vanished.\n\nThe practitioner saw and heard this clearly—neither dream nor waking—then resumed his meditation as usual. On the appointed day of the following month, he went to the place. The household was filled with joy, as if celebrating good fortune. Asking others, he learned that the family had given birth to a child that night. The practitioner was struck with terror, memorized the name, and vowed to first liberate himself before aiding others.\n\n**Assembly**, if you harbor such karmic roots, they will manifest in this life. **Precept-holders**, you must resolve to endure insults, release grudges, bear suffering, forget shame, and suffer loss. You must subdue this mind, accept all afflictions, and wield the *jie dao* [precept-knife] to slay the fire of ignorance at every moment. Clothe yourself in the robe of forbearance, enduring beatings and curses, slander and humiliation, without breaking your precepts even for an instant.\n\nEven when falsely accused, dragged before magistrates, struck by lightning, burned by fire, drowned, robbed, mauled by beasts, bitten by serpents, oppressed by demons, or tormented by spirits—when your reputation is ruined, your kin harmed, or your limbs severed—you cannot escape the retribution of past deeds. The suffering is fated; the debt must be repaid.\n\nDo not resist what is inevitable—it would only harm your precepts. Instead, recall: *Those who wrong me have once been wronged by me. Those who oppress me have once been oppressed by me.* All misfortune—magical, karmic, or otherwise—is self-made, the fruit of past actions. From this day forward, as you uphold the precepts, let all evil deeds dissolve with your mind. Naturally, the six desires will fade, the three poisons vanish, and your body and mind will grow light and serene. Suffering will heal, and grudges will dissolve.\n\n**Assembly**, from the beginningless accumulation of grudges, today you must awaken to your true nature. For every debt, every wrong, vow to endure and repay—harming yourself to benefit others—only then will you attain liberation. Thereafter, you will return to pristine purity, the original unity of the cosmos, preserving the spirit in stillness, refining the perfect retribution-body.\n\nIf you refuse to repay past debts, refuse to surrender present shame, then future retribution will not spare you. How then can this body transcend? How can this mind attain emptiness? How can the Dao be cultivated?\n\nYou cannot even endure a few harsh words now—how can you hope to escape birth and death entirely?\n\n**Assembly**, forbearance extinguishes the fire of ignorance, and the five viscera grow cool. Forbearance brings forth the waters of *Huachi* [the elixir field], and the six bowels harmonize. Forbearance satisfies others’ desires, and grudges dissolve in peace. Forbearance expands your capacity, and your chest grows vast.\n\nIn truth, those who insult you do not truly insult you—only you bear the burden of their karma.\n\nHe who wrongs others, when others wrong him, will surely repay him with wrong.\n\nIf one can endure, then the mind’s *qi* becomes harmonious, preventing liver fire from blazing—transforming into the Southern Dipper’s [Mingantu] disaster-dissolving star.\nIf one can endure, then the lung’s armpit generates moisture, universally nourishing the stomach and spleen—transforming into the Jade Pool’s sweet dew.\nIf one can endure, then kidney essence is not depleted, and the upper and lower *yuan* [vital gates] are freed from peril—transforming into the Wuling Spring.\nIf one can endure, then the spleen’s earth does not wither, and the body becomes light and tranquil—transforming into white snow and golden sprouts.\nIf one can endure, then the *dharma-body* is without leakage, and the Dao’s *qi* becomes divine—manifesting as a resplendent and wondrous form.\n\nTo endure in the realm of the state brings benefit to the court.\nTo endure in the family brings benefit to kin.\nTo endure in the body brings benefit to spirit.\nTo endure in the mind brings benefit to life.\nTo endure in the teaching brings benefit to the *dharma*-affinity.\n\nSuch are the benefits of endurance.\n\nBut if one cannot endure insults and bear burdens,\nthen the mind becomes unempty,\nthe spirit becomes unrefined,\nthe *qi* becomes weak,\nthe capacity becomes narrow,\nthe chest remains unopened,\nthe aspiration becomes small,\nthe practice becomes incomplete,\nthe conduct becomes flawed,\nthe insight becomes shallow,\nthe wisdom becomes diminished,\nthe virtue and merit become shallow,\nthe roots become thin—\nthe Dao remains unclear, the path is obstructed,\none is despised by others, envied by others,\nhated by others, and provokes others’ vexation,\nbecomes arrogant toward others,\ninvites ghostly reproach,\ndreams with terror and alarm,\nis scolded by spirits in daylight,\nsuffers from scabies, leprosy, and maddening rashes,\naccumulates the karmic roots of countless calamities,\nand the retribution of future lives grows ever deeper.\nThe sea of suffering never ceases its waves—\nhow then can one hope to rise above them in vain?\n\n**Assembly**, have you not heard that virtue is fundamental?\nOnly the great in virtue are supported by Heaven—\nHeaven has no favorites, only virtue does it uphold.\n\nAmong you, the wise and foolish differ.\nSome lose virtue for wealth,\nsome for beauty,\nsome for pride.\nThough the external causes of insult vary—\nwhether from wealth, beauty, or pride—\nthe insult itself is one.\n\nThe sages say:\n*\"A single moment of wrath forgets oneself and one’s kin.\"*\n*\"Anger is hard to ponder.\"*\nZengzi said:\n*\"When the heart harbors resentment, it loses its rectitude.\"*\n\nHow weighty is the precept of endurance!\nHow poisonous is the harm of anger!\n\nThus, the True Ones of old took subduing anger as their entry,\nand forgetting anger as their Dao.\nThey took enduring insult as killing the mind,\nand forgetting insult as fulfilling their vow.\n\nThe *Sutra of Rescue from Suffering* by the Taishang Laozun says:\n*\"Fire’s obscurity clears into pure halls,\nSword-trees bloom in fragrant groves.\nTo transcend the Three Realms is hard—\nYet ascend to the Primordial Heaven’s beginning.\"*\n\n「Assembled ones, awaken with urgency and vigor, heed my verses:\n\n*\"Swiftly abandon the self-other duality,\nHasten to perceive the cause of birth and death.\nBy enduring insult and quelling the fire of anger,\nThe formless *Dharma-body* appears in emptiness.\nThe seven emotions vanish with each passing thought,\nThe ancient ones praised the hundredfold endurance.\nBear sweetly all guilt and karmic burdens,\nOnly then does one become a being beyond the *kalpa* (eon).\n\nAll afflictions and obstacles are past causes,\nUnpaid debts and grudges are but one.\nThe foolish, in their darkness, suffer loss—anger ignites,\nA labyrinth of grievances stretches black and boundless.\n\nIn cultivation, guard against seizing advantage,\nFor if I gain, others will not comply.\nThrough endless *kalpas*, one drifts in endless debt,\nYet even in the Pure and Tranquil Hall, discord prevails.\n\nWhere strife finds no lodging, the *Dharma-realm* is vast,\nYet *xianzi* (immortals) and *modu* (demons) have two fates.\nIn the Cool and Blessed Land, endurance is the root,\nRepaying insult-debt fulfills the Dao’s complete power.\n\nThis mortal frame now walks the Dao’s path—\nYet why refuse to bear others’ burdens?\n\nA skyward rage stirs the embers of the *skin* (flesh),\nThe formless True Ones starve as hungry ghosts.»\n\n**Eightfold Purity of Body and Mind**\n\nAssembled ones, having now taken refuge in the precepts,\nYou must single-mindedly seek liberation from the world,\nTo transcend birth and death.\n\nYet those who have ascended beyond birth and death,\nThe highest among the *outseers* (those who escape the world),\nHave the Dao of *no death, no birth*—\nA path where all *dharma* (phenomena) dissolve into *wuwei* (non-action),\nFor the essence is beyond all *dharma*.\n\nThe *dharma* of the world and that of the *outseer*\nDiffer only in the heart’s application—\nWhether inverted or conforming,\nThey are but one *dharma*.\nNor is *dharma* merely the inversion of conformity.\n\nTo conform while applying inversion,\nAll *dharma* submits to the *Wuwei Law*—\nGhosts and gods cannot fathom its workings.\n\nTo invert while following conformity,\nOne *dharma* manifests as myriad *dharma*—\nYin and Yang operate within its design.\n\nIt is not a matter of conscious deliberation,\nBut of the inherent *Divine Intelligence* and *Rational Nature*,\nWhich are thus by their original essence.\nThere is no separate *outseer dharma*.\n\nThough one may transcend the world,\nWho is it that truly does so?\nYet to send this being beyond the world’s confines—\nThat is the true meaning of *outseing*.\n\nBut this is not the case.\n\nNow, the world is vast, the *saha* (realm) expansive—\nWhere is the true *outworld*?\n\nAssembled ones, listen carefully:\nThe *outworld* is beyond the *dharma* of the world.\nPierce the illusion of worldly *dharma*,\nDiscern that all conditioned actions are but dreamlike.\nThings are without substance,\nAffairs are without reality—\nOnly when this heart is purified\nCan one escape beyond the world.\n\nAssembled ones, how does one know this heart can transcend?\nBehold the heavens with their shifting Yin and Yang—\nThey cannot escape the world.\nBehold the earth with its collapses and fissures—\nThey cannot escape the world.\nThe waxing and waning of sun and moon—\nThey cannot escape the world.\nThe distant fall of stars and constellations—\nThey cannot escape the world.\nThe winds, clouds, thunder, and rain,\nFrost, snow, mist, and dew—\nEach bound by measure and limit—\nThey cannot escape the world.\nMountains crumble, stones shatter,\nWaters dry, springs vanish,\nGrasses wither, trees rot,\nGold melts, jade fractures—\nThey cannot escape the world.\nHumans face birth and death—\nThey cannot escape the world.\nAll things endure growth and decay—\nThey cannot escape the world.\nEmotions vary in depth and shallowness—\nThey cannot escape the world.\nQi (breath) rises and falls—\nThey cannot escape the world.\nThe heart shifts between agitation and stillness—\nThey cannot escape the world.\nEssence leaks away—\nThey cannot escape the world.\nSpirit scatters and dims—\nThey cannot escape the world.\nPower wanes and swells—\nThey cannot escape the world.\nGain comes and goes—\nThey cannot escape the world.\nAll conditioned existence follows the *Four Noble Truths* (成住空坏),\nBirth, old age, sickness, and death—\nHow can any of these draw one beyond the world?\n\nAssembled ones, you must within worldly *dharma*\nAwaken to the *outseer dharma*—\nFor this is the path.\n\nThe *outseer dharma* is not in many words,\nBut in turning this heart back to its source.\n\nKnowing that the heavens, earth, and myriad things,\nHuman nature and worldly affairs,\nAre all non-true *dharma*,\nYou realize they are but snares within the world.\n\nIf you awaken in your heart to this truth,\nYou can shatter the illusion that all things are impermanent,\nThat worldly *dharma* and human nature are but phantoms—\nWhat then is the true *ling* (numinous essence)?\n\nThis true *ling* is formless, without attributes,\nSilent, scentless—\nIt is said to be within yet not confined within,\nSaid to be without yet not truly without.\nAll beings possess it,\nAll things encompass it—\nThus it is the sovereign *Dharma-king* of escape.\n\nAssembled ones, this true *ling*—\nAcross time and space, in all things and eras,\nIt is ever-present, never obscured.\nPenetrating heaven, piercing earth,\nEmerging from darkness, entering the void.\nNeither born nor altered,\nNeither excessive nor deficient.\nWithout lack or surplus,\nWithout coming or going—\nIt governs Yin and Yang yet is not enslaved by them.\nIt commands ghosts and gods yet is not afflicted by them.\nIt employs all things yet is not hindered by them.\nIt transforms human nature yet is not moved by it.\nIt responds to worldly *dharma* yet is not drowned by it.\nIt transcends the world while dwelling in it.\nIt roams the Three Realms freely,\nIt oversees all spirits with unfathomable change.\n\nAbove the heavens, below the earth—\nOnly this is worthy of reverence,\nNo equal exists.\n\nYet this true *ling* is had by all,\nEach struggles to perceive it.\nFrom myriad *dharma* and thousand gates,\nFrom the Three Vehicles and One Treasure,\nAll originate from here.\n\nIn the *Teachings of the Confucian School*, it is called *Mingde Zhishan* (Illuminated Virtue, Perfect Goodness).\nIn the *Daoist Tradition*, it is the *Yuanming Daolao* (Round Illumination, the Daoist Mother).\nIt is also called *Zushi* (Primordial Qi).\nThe myriad other names are inexhaustible.\n\nWhere does one seek the *dharma* that knows all things?\nIn the *Great Learning* (《大学》):\n*\"Clarify your Illuminated Virtue,\nStop at Perfect Goodness.\"*」\n\n「Some subtle marvels, some profound mysteries—\nAwakening to them is before your very eyes,\nYet bewilderment casts you into the depths of the sea.\n\n**Assembled ones**, know this: the path to transcendence\nDoes not exceed the two words—*body* and *mind*.\n\nThe body is borrowed, the mind is true,\nThe mind is borrowed, the *nature* is true—\nYou must grasp the *Way* of cultivating truth through borrowed forms.\n\nThe external is borrowed, the internal is true,\nThe external is form, the internal is emptiness—\nWithout relying on the external, colored and impermanent body,\nYou cannot cultivate the internal, formless *Dharma-body*.\n\nWithout abandoning the aged, sick, dying body born of external causes,\nYou cannot fathom the pristine, perfect mind within.\n\nWithout relying on the vital, living *qi* of the mind,\nYou cannot transcend and realize the boundless, limitless *nature*.\n\nYet this *nature*, since the decree of Heaven,\nFrom the very beginning of life,\nIs utterly untainted—\nIt shares the same essence as the *Great Void* (太虚),\nIt shares the same measure as the *Great Void*.\n\nEmpty, hollow, and void,\nIt possesses nothing at all.\n\nComplete, whole, and perfect,\nIt lacks nothing.\n\n**Assembled ones**, now if you seek transcendence,\nFirst, each must purify *body* and *mind*.\n\nHow does one purify *body* and *mind*?\nThe body is formed by the *qi* of blood and breath—\nThis *qi* is not inherently corrupt,\nBut truly the root of birth and death,\nThe source of all calamities.\n\nIt entangles the mind,\nAnd harms the *nature*.\n\nSeeking pleasure through lust and desire,\nChasing fame and gain for worldly benefit,\nBreaking laws to invite punishment,\nSummoning disasters and diseases—\nAll arise from this body.\n\nThe *Supreme Sage* said:\n*\"When people have afflictions,\nIt is because they have a body.\nIf they have no body,\nWhat afflictions remain?\"*\n\nThe ancients declared:\n*\"If one is not bound by form,\nRight before your eyes lies the Great Sage of the Luo.\"*\n\nThus, this body is no small source of woe.\n\nNow, you must see through the skin-bag as a borrowed thing,\nA concoction of earth, water, and wind.\n\nIf you do not pursue purification to its utmost,\nAnd merely urge people to practice filial piety,\nSaying that the body and hair are received from parents,\nAnd must not be harmed—\n\nParental essence and maternal blood,\nCombined in the Five Agents,\nBear the refined *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd obtain the divine power of *yin* and *yang*.\n\nThe head, round as Heaven,\nThe feet, square as Earth—\nPlaced between Heaven and Earth,\nShared among the Three Talents,\nAmong all things, humans are first.\n\nAbove, we can pair with Heaven and Earth,\nBelow, we can honor the spirits and *devas*.\nIn learning, we can aspire to the sages,\nIn cultivation, we can become *immortals*, Buddhas.\n\nHow can we regard this most noble, rich body\nAs a foul, worthless clod of earth?\n\nOnly those who embrace the *Precepts*,\nWho refuse to sink into decline,\nWho are not entangled by worldly waves—\n\nWho do not seek bodily comfort,\nBut return their true *nature* to its true constant—\n\nWho wish to govern *yin* and *yang* with their will and *qi*,\nWho wish to adorn the *Dharma-realm* with their form and spirit—\n\nIf even the *Dharma-body* is flawed,\nThen form and spirit cannot both be wondrous,\nAnd the *Way* cannot be truly united.\n\n**Assembled ones**, I now explain the practice of purification to you.\nIf you wish this body to be pure,\nFirst cast aside worldly attachments,\nSever dusty emotions,\nAnd differ entirely from worldly *dharma*.\n\nEmbrace simplicity and take joy in quietude,\nAbandon richness and leave behind clamor.\n\nTake refuge in the Three Treasures,\nAnd steadfastly uphold the One Truth.\n\nNurture your *nature* and emotions to be serene and balanced,\nKeep your hands and feet dignified and composed—\nYour eyes and ears must not stray to evil,\nYour thoughts must not be scattered and chaotic,\nYour mind must not dwell on contrivance or fixation,\nYour speech must not be loud or boastful.\n\nRetract the divine light of your two eyes,\nTo illuminate within and never dim the sacred *platform* (灵台);\n\nReturn the refined essence of your two ears,\nTo listen inwardly and always hear the Celestial Resonance.\n\nSparingly speak, often silent,\nAnd return to the natural, unshaken stillness.\n\nRegret none, wander in thought no more,\nYour spirit unperturbed, the Heavenly Mechanism clear—\nThe profound *principles* complete and unobstructed.\n\nCease consuming meat and blood,\nTo secretly dissolve the karmic retribution of countless lives.\n\nFollow the *Precepts* in body,\nAnd solemnly uphold the majesty of the Four Great Elements.\n\nIf your steps are not disorderly, your mind will not be agitated,\nIf your hands do not move recklessly, your mind will not be restless.\n\nSit upright and centered, never allowing crookedness,\nLie alert and aware, guarding against excessive slumber—\nEat simple and bland foods to reduce flavors,\nAnd let the Five *Zang* Organs remain tranquil and peaceful.\n\nSpeak with caution and composure,\nAnd let your voice be harmonious and resonant.\n\nThis is called the *coarse practice* of purifying the body.\n\nAs for the subtle methods,\nThey require you to ponder the two words—*pure* and *still*—\nLest you fail to penetrate them into your heart,\nAnd instead lament that you cannot achieve the *Way*,\nThough you diligently study and practice.\n\n**Assembled ones**, a mind without dual thoughts is *pure*,\nA thought without obstruction is *still*.\n\nThe mind not clinging to forms is *pure*,\nA thought not stopping is *still*.\n\nThoughts clear and complete are *pure*,\nLight unobstructed is *still*.\n\nNot a speck of defilement is *pure*,\nAll considerations emptied are *still*.\n\nAll things cannot hide their forms from you—*pure*,\nSpirits cannot fathom your workings—*still*.\n\nThe mind like flowing water is *pure*,\nThe *nature* like bright moon is *still*.\n\nSince beginningless time, all guilt destroyed—*pure*,\nAll causes from countless eons utterly clear—*still*.\n\nObserving your mind, yet no mind is seen—*pure*,\nGazing at all things, yet no things are seen—*still*.\n\nWhen these three insights are awakened—*pure*,\nOnly seeing emptiness—*still*.\n\nSeeing emptiness, yet emptiness itself is seen—*pure*,\nEmptiness possessing nothing to be emptied—*still*.\n\nWhat is emptied has no existence,\nWithout existence, there is no \"without\"—*pure*,\nEver-pervasive stillness—*still*,\nStillness possessing nothing to be still—*still*.\n\nThe true constant responds to all things—*pure*,\nThe constant response is ever-still—*still*.\n\nPierced through without doubt—*pure*,\nEntering the gates of all wonders—*still*.\n\nTranscending the Three Realms—*pure*,\nLiberated from the Five Agents—*still*.\n\nShattering the void—*pure*,\nShattering into the void—*still*.\n\nLight encompassing all heavens—*pure*,\nUniversally delivering all beings—*still*.\n\n**Assembled ones**, I have briefly opened the path for you.\nThe Three Teachings’ sages,\nThe vast treasury of scriptures—\n\nAll *dharma*s, myriad gates,\nThe wondrous forms of all heavens—」\n\nThe thirty-six thousand *Dao*s,\nEighty-four thousand *dharma* gates—\nAll *bodhisattvas* as numerous as the Ganges’ sands,\nCountless *golden immortals*—\nNone can escape the wondrous, effortless *dharma* of pure stillness and insight.\n\n**Assembled ones**, the supreme, most exalted *Mahayana* path of ultimate truth—\nGiving birth to heavens, earths,\nHumans, and all beings—\nAll arise from pure stillness.\n\nThe *Taishang* says:\n*\"If one remains ever-calm and still,\nHeaven and earth shall all submit to them.\"*\nAgain it says:\n*\"Stillness brings rectitude to the world.\"*\nThus, it is clear: to still the body and mind,\nSwiftly seek awakening.\n\n**Assembled ones**, from this day forth,\nCast aside all past delusions—\nThe lead-mercury, dragon-tiger, yin-yang refining,\nAll metaphorical alchemical arts—\nDiscard them all.\n\nOnly follow the path of pure stillness,\nExtinguish deluded thoughts,\nBanish errant desires,\nSteady and unshaken,\nWalk the middle, straight path—\nFear not delay,\nFor hesitation is not error—\nIf there is a path, do not board the boat.\n\nIf I deceive you with falsehood,\nI shall fall into hell.\n\nAt that time, the *Lüshi* spoke this verse:\n\n*\"A scattered mind is not still,\nDust-filled, the body is not pure.\nImpure, the nature is hard to see,\nUnstill, how could it lack passion?\nInner light reveals the body as illusion,\nReturning radiance, the heart is void.\nWithin the void, the spirit manifests itself—\nStillness and insight are the true *宗* (*zong*).\nObserve the sun and moon,\nIn daily life, embody and practice.\nTo hold the Dipper’s handle in reverse,\nStillness aligns with the Heavenly Will.\"*\n\nThe Ninefold Seeking of the Master.\n\n「From ancient times onward, sages, immortals, and Buddhas—\nThose who have attained fruition and realized truth—\nNone have been enlightened without a teacher.\n\nThus, teachers pass on the Way to one another,\nMouth to mouth, heart to heart, seal to seal.\nWithin these teachings, the Dao is uninterrupted and whole.\n\nLike milk turning into water,\nLike glue and lacquer merging,\nQi seeks its like, sounds resonate alike—\nWater and sky in one hue,\nLamp-light intermingling,\nOnly then can one grasp the full essence of teacher and disciple.\n\n**Great Assembly**, I observe that many in this world seek teachers and ask questions, yet most fall short.\nThey bear the name of teacher-disciple transmission,\nBut lack its true substance.\n\nTherefore, today I spare neither words nor reputation,\nUnfearing slander or ridicule,\nTo reveal the principles of seeking a teacher and inquiring about the Dao—\nYou must remember them deeply,\nFor first, as a disciple to others,\nIf you uphold this practice,\nThen later, as a teacher yourself,\nYour disciples will follow the ancient ways,\nAnd honor the teacher for the sake of the Dao.\n\n**Great Assembly**, the ignorant and blind in this world\nDo not recognize their own hearts,\nAnd drift with external things.\nThough they harbor thoughts of the Dao,\nThey fail to distinguish right from wrong paths;\nThough they possess a Daoist heart,\nThey do not know the methods of cultivation.\n\nWhen they hear the words:\n*\"Nature is self-realized,\nLife depends on the teacher’s transmission,\"*\nThey act upon them without reflection.\n\nSome chance upon a wandering Daoist,\nClad in patched robes, barefoot in straw sandals,\nWielding a palm-leaf fan,\nShouldering a meditation cushion,\nPassing through cities with leisurely ease.\nOr they sit at street corners,\nBegging alms with a wooden bowl;\nOr stroll along the road,\nFree and unconstrained.\n\nAt temples or halls, they rest briefly,\nBefore monasteries, they borrow lodging.\nThey mouth incantations,\nTheir tongues drumming like gongs and pipes.\nYet how can they speak of the *玄关* (*Xuan Guan* / Mystic Pass)?\nOr the *尾闾* (*Wei Liu* / Cauda Equina)?\nHow can they reach the *泥丸宫* (*Ni Wan Gong* / Mud Pellet Palace) below,\nOr the *涌泉穴* (*Yong Quan Xue* / Gushing Spring Acupoint) above?\nHow can they practice *守中提气* (*shou zhong ti qi* / Governing the Center and Raising the Qi)?\nOr stand firm as the *鼎* (*ding* / Cauldron) and

Arts).\nWho can enumerate them all?»\n\n「The multitude—these foolish and blind disciples—lack wisdom in their hearts.\nHow could they distinguish truth from falsehood, or righteousness from depravity?\nYet they follow such *Dao* practitioners without hesitation.\n\nEven more despicable are those who speak of *鼎器* (*Ding Qi* / Cauldron and Furnace),\nthose fraudulent *茅银* (*Mao Yin* / Grass-Silver) alchemists,\nwho seduce others with their allure or ensnare them with wealth.\nTo say nothing of the *Dao* methods that yield no results,\neven if these *Dao* methods contained some truth—\ncould common mortals transmute base metals into gold?\nCould licentious men prolong their lives?\n\nThus, those who speak of *Ding Qi*:\nseeing beauty, their minds are stirred;\nconfronting circumstances, their thoughts awaken—\ntheir spirits scatter, their true *汞* (*Gong* / Mercury) descends,\nthe *先天* (*Xian Tian* / Primordial Heaven) is overturned,\nthe supreme treasure

Nourishing) and *开点* (*Kai Dian* / Unblocking),\nendless schemes of deception and trickery—\ntheir gullible and greedy victims often meet ruin,\nand their crimes surpass those of the *Dao* practitioners mentioned earlier by manyfold.\n\nI cannot bear to elaborate further,\nlest it invite slander.\nBut for those who have taken the *戒* (precepts),\nI must outline the general principles of seeking a teacher and inquiring into the *Dao*.»\n\n「Assembly,\n\nThis supreme Dao of the Sovereign Heaven (*Huang Tian* / Imperial Sky) is vague and indistinct (*huǎng huǎng hū hū, yǎo yǎo míng míng* / dimly and boundlessly obscure);\nit is boundless, vast, exalted, and revered;\nit is profound, concealed, and deeply mysterious.\nIts greatness knows no outer limit, its subtlety knows no inner bound.\nIt can span the heavens and measure the earth,\nit can traverse the unseen and enter the void.\nIt exists and yet seems absent—\nit does not get wet in water, nor does it burn in fire;\nbefore it, there is no past, after it, there is no future—\nit gives birth to Heaven and Earth,\nit governs the sun and moon, nurtures all things;\nit produces sages and worthies, it produces immortals and Buddhas.\nEven the crawling insects and plants possess it—\nno one lacks it, no place is without it.\nIn daily life, it is everywhere, yet all are wondrous Dao.\nBut because common folk use it without knowing,\nthe vulgar are deluded and fail to awaken,\nthe true is lost, and countless eons pass without clarity.\n\nBefore your parents gave you birth,\nthe true spirit (*Zhen Ling*) knew not its beginning;\nafter your spirit departs,\nthis body knows not its end.\nInverted cycles of rebirth (*Dian Dao Lun Hui* / transmigration),\nsuffering in life and death.\nTherefore, I point out its source and root (*Yuan Gen*),\nurging you to seek true teachers and early hear this Dao.\n\nYet true teachers are hard to meet,\nand worthy disciples are hard to find.\nKnow that if disciples lack true out-of-the-world sincerity (*Chun Xin*),\ntheir wisdom is obscured—\neven if they encounter a true teacher,\nspirits and deities (*Gui Shen*) will not let them see,\nthey will conceal the disciple’s wisdom—\nand even if they see, they cannot recognize the teacher as true.\n\nIf teachers lack the heart to save the world (*Du Shi Xin*),\neven if they meet worthy disciples,\nspirits and deities will not allow them to be seen,\nthey will veil the disciple’s *法眼* (*Dharma Eye*),\nand the teacher will perceive no affinity—\nmany opportunities pass by right before their eyes.\n\nAssembly,\nteachers seek disciples as one rolls a *芥* (*jie* / sesame seed) to find a needle;\ndisciples seek teachers like grasping the moon in water.\nTrue teachers are rare, worthy disciples are hard to find—\nnot because of wealth or treasure,\nbut because of the sincerity of a single thought within the heart.\n\nYou see which true Dao teachers (*You Dao Shi Fu*)\nwould dare to transmit falsely to unworthy people (*Fei Ren*),\nor which high ones (*Gao Ren*) seeking Dao would dare to blindly revere teachers?\n\nAssembly,\nif teachers do not transmit falsely to disciples,\nthen this teacher holds the Dao supreme,\nand seeks worthy disciples.\nIf disciples do not blindly revere teachers,\nthen this person has keen insight and discernment,\ntheir mind is open and their vision sharp.\n\nEven those who refuse to lightly revere teachers or blindly follow Dao,\nwhose hearts are empty of obstacles (*Xing Ai*),\nwhose aspirations are free from dust (*Chen Huan*),\nwhose vision is broad and whose spirit is vast—\nwhen they meet a true Dao teacher,\ntheir understanding will be clear beyond words,\nthey can speak of it, see through it,\nand in half a sentence,\nthe sesame seed and needle will meet,\nthe needle’s eye will align with the seed.\n\nWhen such worthy disciples meet a teacher who does not lightly take disciples or falsely transmit,\nhow could the teacher not joyfully engage in deep discussion,\nin expansive discourse on profound truths (*Miao Jue* / wondrous keys),\nin authentic explanations (*Zhen Quan*),\nin subtle yet profound mysteries (*Wei Mi*),\nin heart-transmitted Dao and orally bestowed celestial principles (*Tian Zhang*)?\n\nAssembly,\ntrue teachers are not few,\nworthy disciples are many.\nBut how do we know which are true teachers and not few?\n\nAssembly,\nthe six senses (*Liu Gen* / Six Roots) you possess all have true teachers.\nFor instance, if your ears hear virtuous words (*Shan Yan*),\nand you truly follow them with conviction (*Shan Shuo*),\nthis sense of hearing (*Er Gen* / Ear Root)\nis your guiding teacher,\nand these virtuous words are the transmitting teacher.\nThe same applies to the other five senses.\n\nAssembly,\nthere is no fixed teacher in learning (*Xue Wu*),\nonly the Dao is the teacher.\nWhenever your ears hear good words and virtuous speech,\nyou must focus your spirit and listen in silence—\nas if sweet dew were dripping into your heart,\nor if clear wisdom (*Xing Ke* / Awakening Mind) were poured upon your crown—\nconcentrate your mind and silently absorb this person,\nwho opens my stupidity and ignorance (*Yu Mei*),\nwho acts with compassion and skillful means (*Ci Bei Fang Bian*),\nwishing this person who proclaims virtuous words\nto quickly attain profound merit (*Xuan Gong*),\nto obtain the unsurpassed Dao (*Wu Shang Dao*),\nis this not teacher and disciple?\n\nIf your eyes see all the sutras (*Jing Dian*),\nthe scriptures of the Three Teachings (*San Jiao*),\ntrue words and secret keys (*Zhen Yan Mi Jue*),\nand you attain awakening through them,\nthen you should pay homage and praise them—\nsuch texts are your true recognition and utmost faith.\nNaturally, teacher and disciple will meet.\n\nYet the teacher’s compassionate boat of the law (*Ci Hang Fa Qiao*),\nthe bridge of instruction,\nis not a single method.\nMencius said:\n“Teaching methods are many indeed.\nThere are those who perfect virtue (*Cheng De*),\nthose who cultivate talent (*Da Cai*),\nthose who answer questions (*Da Wen*),\nand those who privately emulate and learn (*Si Shu Ai*),\nthese are all methods of teaching and instruction.”\n\nThus, there are those who bow their heads and rejoice in meeting (*Qing Gai*),\nwho immediately align upon seeing;\nthere are those who humbly confess their ignorance (*Zi Shou Ru Xin*),\nwho do not presume superiority over others;\nthere are those who kowtow and bend the knee in transmission (*Qi Shou Qu Xi*),\nthere are those who make solemn vows and pledges before transmission (*Zhai Jin Meng Shi*),\nwho then receive the teaching.\n\nReverence is the incomplete form of respect (*Li* / Rites).\nReverence without sincerity is not true reverence.\nWhat matters is observing the disciple’s sincerity and steadfast practice (*Cheng Xin Du Xing*),\nrespecting the teacher and honoring the Dao.\n\nThus, there are those who test repeatedly before transmission—\nlike the ten trials of *Dong Bin* (the Immortal) in *Yun Fang* (the Cloud Room).\nThere are those who humble themselves before being seen—\nlike *Liu Xuan De* (Lord Liu) of the Three Visits to *Mao Lu* (the thatched hut).\nSome have followed their teachers for years,\nyet their hearts do not turn toward the Dao (*Xin Bu Tui Zhuan*).\nSome know the truth of sincerity,\nyet deliberately test with many hardships (*Gu Shi Duo Jian*).\n\nThis transmission of the Dao and reception of its teachings (*Shou Ye*),\nis it not something of great significance,\nnot something easily obtained?\n\nThus, there are those who speak not with three mouths,\nwho transmit not with six ears (*San Kou Bu Yan, Liu Er Bu Chuan*).\nThe highest teachings (*Shang Cheng Dao Fa*)\ncannot be transmitted to the middle and low;\nthe middle and low teachings (*Zhong Xia Dao Fa*)\ncannot be transmitted to the superior in wisdom (*Shang Zhi*).\n\nOnly does one teach according to the person (*Yin Ren Er Jiao*).\nAs when *Ran You* asked about *Wen Si Xing Zhi* (the method of hearing and practicing),\nthe Master said:\n“Hear and practice.”\nWhen *Zi Lu* asked about *Wen Si Xing Zhi*,\nthe Master said:\n“With parents and elder brothers present,\nhow could you hear and practice?”\n\nFor *Ran You* was humble (*Qiu Ye Tui*),\nso he was advanced (*Jin Zhi*),\nwhile *Zi Lu* was of mediocre talent (*You Ye Jian Ren*),\nso he was held back (*Tui Zhi*).\nThis is why they could not both hear the same teachings.\n\nThus, *Gong Xi Hua* (Zigong) heard it twice,\nand yet still fell into doubt and confusion (*Sheng Yi Huo*).」\n\nThe Master and his disciples asked about *ren* (benevolence/virtue) in great numbers, yet the Master’s responses varied—this is so.\n\nSome may take it with sincere faith, while others hear it casually; those with faith may be spoken to, while the casual hearers may not.\n\nThus it is said: *“Do not dismiss it as trivial just because it is easily obtained.”*\n\nTo the assembly: some may transmit the Dao among thousands, yet the wise among them grasp it easily, while the dull find it hard to practice. If one shouts aloud, revealing the profound mysteries, those who listen with intent may record it, but those who lack the right connection hear it as mere words, carried away like wind through the ear.\n\nTo the assembly: the Buddha Śākyamuni raised his flower and showed it to all, saying: *“I possess the wondrous bright true-nature, the nirvāṇa-mind, the true Dharma-eye treasure—can all of you see and attain it?”* Only Mahākāśyapa smiled in response.\n\nTo the assembly: Mahākāśyapa, the Śākyan, openly cultivated the *Zhàn Dào* (the high road) while secretly crossing the *Chén Cāng* (the hidden pass). Before the great assembly, he transmitted the secret Dao in private, mind-to-mind, mouth-to-mouth. Yet those seated below remained unaware of what was transmitted or received.\n\nAgain, like the Sage Confucius before the assembly of sages and worthy disciples, he said to Zēngzi: *“Shēn, my Dao is one thread running through all.”* Zēngzi replied: *“Yes.”* At that time, his disciples were many—was this not the Sage transmitting the Dao before the disciples, while Zēngzi passed it on within the gathered disciples?\n\nOrdinary people do not recognize their own true-nature, so they meet it yet fail to meet it, unaware of what is transmitted or passed on.\n\nBut Zēngzi deeply understood his own nature, naturally aligning with the Sage’s intent.\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor, Xuānyuán, sought the Dao in the Kūndūn Mountains from Guāngchéngzi. He repeatedly urged his request, but Guāngchéngzi gave no answer. The Yellow Emperor withdrew to fast and meditate, dwelling in seclusion for three months, then returned, bowing humbly, advancing on his knees, and asked for the essence of the supreme Dao. Guāngchéngzi then replied:\n\n*“The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and dark;\nits utmost reaches are dim and silent.\nSee nothing, hear nothing—embrace the Spirit in stillness,\nand the form will naturally align.\nBe utterly still, be utterly clear—\ndo not weary your body,\ndo not let your thoughts flutter ceaselessly,\nthen you may attain longevity.\nGuard your exterior, close your interior—\nexcessive cleverness brings ruin.\nI hold to its One and dwell in its harmony,\nthus I have not aged for twelve hundred years.”*\n\nThese few words were spoken directly to the Yellow Emperor, yet he said no more.\n\nFollow them if you will—it is your choice.\nDo not follow them if you will—it is also your choice.\n\nThis is called *each fulfilling their own Dao*.\n\nGreat Assembly, within my Daoist tradition, the **Moral Teachings of the Southern Flower** (道德南华) contain countless profound meanings;\nthe **Primordial Purity and Refined Substance** (冲虚文始) hold many **true words** (真言).\nAnd the **Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries** (三洞四辅), the **Thirty-six Mysteries** (三十六奇), how many **scriptures** (经文) are there!\n\nWho can **purify their ears** (打扫耳根) and reverently listen to the **wondrous critiques** (妙谤) of the **Sacred Scriptures** (圣经);\nwho can **open their vision** (放开眼界) and **transcendally perceive** (超悟) the **supreme Dao** (大道) beyond mere verbal exposition (言诠)?\nIf one fails to perceive it, their mind will not be **illuminated** (光明),\neven if they meet a **sage-teacher** (圣师), they will still fail to recognize the truth.\n\nGreat Assembly, before seeking a teacher, you must first **seek your own self** (求已).\nBefore inquiring into the Dao, you must first **inquire within your own heart** (问心).\nIf you do not **abide by the precepts** (依律) in your practice (行持),\nit will be **utterly impossible** (万难) to meet a teacher and **verify the Dao** (印道).\n\nThe **critical junctures** (关窍) within this path\nultimately demand that you **remain humble and lowly** (谦虚卑抑),\nfirst **completely excising** (刳剔) the **arrogant pride and self-delusion** (贡高我慢) from your heart,\nand **softening, harmonizing, yielding, and submitting** (柔和逊顺).\n**Sever all thoughts of slander and envy** (诽谤嫉妒之念) at once.\nWhen meeting others, **never boast of your own abilities** (莫自夸能),\nfor fear that someone may **possess equal or greater merit** (能似你).\nIf you chance upon a **perspicacious sage** (明眼高人) or a **mind-empty, will-illuminated adept** (心空志士),\na mere **half-spoken phrase** (一言半语) could **sever you at the waist** (拦腰截住),\nand how then would you **struggle free** (挣脱)?\nYou would **naturally melt like snow, revealing your corpse** (雪化见尸),\nand **escape no discerning eye** (难逃识者).\n\nI now **solemnly exhort** (奉劝) the Great Assembly:\nseeking a teacher and inquiring into the Dao is no **hasty affair** (草草).\nBefore asking your teacher, **bow your head a few times** (磕下几个头),\nand do not think that merely **hearing a few words** (听几声) will suffice.\nNowadays, **disciples disrespect their teachers and slight the Dao** (戒子轻师慢道), such cases are **ubiquitous** (比比皆然).\n\nGreat Assembly, you must **urgently turn inward and reflect** (反躬内省),\nand **repent your past disdain and arrogance** (忏悔侮傲) before the **ascended masters and ancestral teachers** (历祖师前).\nChange your old habits, **revere the treasures of the Law** (尊敬法宝).\nIf you **truly, sincerely, and earnestly** (真心苦切) **keep watch and seek a teacher** (留眼访师),\nthen **Heaven will not fail humanity** (天不负人),\nand **the Immortal and the True** (仙真) will **come of their own accord** (不求自至),\nnot bound by **distance, proximity, or time** (远近迟早).\n\nListen to my **gatha** (偈言):\n*\"To seek a teacher, one must first conquer self;\nTo inquire into the Dao, one’s heart must be sincere.\nWith sincerity, the Dao is perceived;\nWith earnestness, one meets a worthy cause.\nDifficult to encounter in ten thousand kalpas,\nRare to find in a thousand lifetimes—\nNow, in this very age.\nIf you grasp my meaning clearly,\nYou will **suddenly awaken** (顿悟) to the Dao’s **unborn roots** (未生根).\"*\n\nFrom the **Scripture of the Verdant Garden Platform** (碧苑坛经), Volume Ten: *\"The Ten Precepts of Illuminated Wisdom\"* (定慧等持).\n\n「大众，但受初真戒者，进受中极，先将初真十戒，细微妙行，密密行持过了，方来进受中极三百大戒。\n\n大众，中极戒与初真戒有甚分别？\n一戒无所不戒，一真无所不真了。\n\n怎么初真之后，又有中极，中极之后又有天仙，这却为何分别先后呢？\n大众，这个道理也甚明白易见。\n我将这个道理，就向虚空取来告你。\n\n大众，你受的乃初真十戒，乃是教你们拘制色身，乘风破浪，不许妄动胡行，起止无常的。\n至中极三百大戒，乃是教你们降伏顽心，不许妄想胡思，七心八意的。\n至天仙妙戒，乃是教你们解脱真意，不许执着粘缚的。\n\n大众，初真十戒粗，中极三百便细了。\n夫初真戒，制其外六根；中极戒扫其内六尘，天仙妙戒，使三身解脱，八识消亡，九魔十难不敢侵犯。\n\n大众，初真戒者，是因你们即悟前非，深追旧过，又念人生在世，光阴有限，生死无常，既是出家做了道士，便就叫做全真。\n仔细思量，自从出家到今，何曾全过什么真来，终年虚度时日，与俗人一样的老了。\n终朝涉水登山，南奔北走，虽是朝礼过了几座名山，比俗人多见些石头树木，究竟与俗人经商为客，做买卖的一般苦。\n食风宿水，着甚来由？\n何曾遇见神仙？\n传什口诀都是掮上掮下的俗人，俗眼凡胎，把丹经念上几篇，死死牢记着屑屑，名为吞石头，不会化的，全不知味。\n是故与俗人无异，安能出世超凡。\n\n今日受了初真戒，这知过之心，也还是本来面目犹存。\n何不把平时的假心肠改作真心肠，平日的假意思改作真意思，平日的假面目改作真面目。\n发露真心伸忏悔。\n今日受戒之日为始，唤作初真戒子。\n\n这初真戒律，行四大威仪，庄严身相，与法身无涉，定慧无干。\n知因你们浮躁得紧，不能沉静，所以把十戒制伏其身。\n若能依戒律行持，则此身安静而定，以进中极戒了。\n\n大众，这中极戒，是定功，与初真戒不同。\n初真是个戒字，中极是个定字，天仙戒是个慧字。\n当初天尊慈悯众生，设此戒定慧，降伏身心意的功夫，就是出世超凡，金丹妙宝也。\n除此戒定慧之外，就别无什么法儿了。\n外虽有八万四千种法，都不能跳出这个定慧两字。\n凭你神丹服食、金液还丹、白日升天、拔宅冲举、神通变化、尽空尸解、立化坐亡、投胎夺舍，许多的仙术，那定慧之光，却巍然不动。\n照见这些神通法术，如明镜当庭，一出一入，莫不自见其形，乃还在定慧之中，不能出定慧之外。\n\n大众，中极的中字便是斗姥天枢，巍巍不动之中；\n这个极字便是南极注生，北极注死之极，生死大机，全凭斗柄默运灵枢之极。\n中极二字，秉天地之权，执生死之柄。\n这中字是非内非外，非左非右，非前非后，不偏不倚，无过不及的中字。\n允执厥中致中和的中，多言数穷不如守中的中，君子中道而行之中，中立而不倚之中。\n玄珠黍米，牟尼舍利，金丹大极，许多假名别号，其实不出这个虚灵不昧的妙明真性也。\n\n大众，如何是定慧等持？\n大众，这一点灵机，被你无始以来，所作的三业萦缠，六尘粘染，七情迷塞，六欲侵欺，三毒熏蒸，十魔强霸。\n把你的灵机暗窃，要死不敢偷生，要生不敢即死。\n上不能观天之道，执天之行。\n\n大众，这点灵机，是个法宝，只宜逆转，不可顺行。」\n\nTo follow the Way in accordance with things is to drift with their transformations—\nwhen confronted by circumstances, one stirs and summons demons, gathering calamities,\ninviting harm and misfortune.\nThus one cycles through birth and death,\nwandering the Four Generations and Six Paths,\nadrift and sinking without end.\n\nBut those who receive the **Middle Pole Precept** must instead **reverse the Way**.\nTo reverse is to not follow all things in their turning,\nto not follow all circumstances in their shifts—\ndemons, monsters, and disasters dare not assail,\nthe Wheel of Rebirth may be transcended,\nand wandering may be surpassed.\n\nNow, how does one call this **following the Way**?\nIn the secular world:\nto bear sons and daughters,\nto take wives and concubines,\nto nurture grandchildren and children,\nto seek fame and wealth,\nto hoard property and land,\nto wear fine silks and embroidered robes,\nto indulge in lust and desire,\nto kill and take life—\nall these are but fleeting pleasures for the **colored body**.\n\nYet this **colored body** is but an illusory vessel of earth, water, fire, and wind,\nformed by the union of father’s essence and mother’s blood,\nwhere vital forces coalesce and consciousness takes root,\nconceiving life within the womb.\nAll this arises from the interplay of **yin and yang qi**,\nyet it is impermanent, ultimately returning to dust.\n\nOnly the two matters of **merit and demerit** do not concern the colored body—\ninstead, it is the **Dharma-body** that bears the suffering.\n\nAlas! You do not believe,\nyet claim the **Dharma-body** resides within the colored body.\nWhen the colored body dies, the Dharma-body is already void—\nwhen a person dies, their **spirit-qi disperses into emptiness**.\nHow then can one speak of heavens and hells,\nof hungry ghosts and beastly rebirths,\nor of the Dharma-body receiving retribution?\n\nNow I ask you:\nWhen a person dies, their **spirit-qi disperses into nothingness**—\nwhy then do families, at the four seasons and eight festivals,\nset up offerings and sacrifices?\nIf this lingering **spirit-qi** were not taken by the Underworld to be judged,\nthen the sins and virtues of this life—\nbetrayals, thefts, murders, and all manner of karmic debts—\nwould mean this **spirit-qi** would not return to accept the sacrifices of descendants.\n\nIf it does not return to receive the world’s sacrifices,\nthen why did ancient texts like the *Zhou Li* speak of elaborate sacrificial rites,\nsacrificial texts, vessels, and ceremonies?\nWhy did the Sage Confucius say:\n*\"To serve the dead as you would the living,\nto treat the departed as if they were present,\nto sacrifice as though they were there,\nto sacrifice to the spirits as if the spirits were there\"*—\nthat when the Duke of Zhou received sacrifices in ceremonial attire,\nhe appeared *\"vast and present, as if standing above, beside\"*?\nAnd why does the *Odes* say:\n*\"The spirit’s response is profound,\nunfathomable—\nthe King stands above,\nilluminating the heavens\"*?\n\nIf such teachings were passed down—\n*\"as if standing above, the King stands above\"*—\nthen my heart must already harbor sincerity toward the presence of ghosts and spirits.\nIf my heart holds this sincerity,\nthen the great sages of old—Zhou Gong and Confucius—\nmust have deeply known the nature of ghosts and spirits,\nand thus established these sacrificial texts, vessels, rites, and ceremonies\nto instruct countless generations without end.\nWould the sages fabricate lies or conjure falsehoods?\n\nAnd now, when officials receive posthumous honors and titles,\nif the **spirit-qi** after death were truly dispersed and unaware,\nthen the posthumous glory would already be excessive.\nWho receives the golden seals and purple edicts?\nWho enjoys the blessings of ascending to heaven?\n\nIf receiving blessings means ghosts and spirits are present,\nand suffering means they are absent,\nthen it is only your own heart that is unclear,\nyour **true nature** that remains unawakened.\n\nThere are those foolish and ignorant who,\nknowing only lust for wine and women,\nobsession with wealth and power,\nunaware of the karmic roots of death,\ncling only to the fleeting **blood-qi** of life,\nand arrogantly recite:\n*\"Do not ponder the endless affairs of the dead—\njust drain the wine while you live.\"*\n\nOr they might recite:\n*\"When the body perishes, all else vanishes—\nin the underworld, only karma follows the corpse.\"*\n\nThe **Three Karmas** are thus:\nThe first is **unwholesome karma**—\nall its branches and leaves unbroken, unsevered,\nendless and unexhausted,\nwith causes and effects, with deeds and retributions.\nSuch as disbelief in ghosts and spirits,\ndisrespect for heaven and earth,\ncontempt for royal law,\ndisloyalty to the sovereign,\nfilial disobedience,\ncorruption of the Three Bonds and Five Relationships,\nslandering the sages,\nmurder, theft, licentiousness, and **wickedness**—\nall such deeds,\nwhen the life ends,\nplunge one into hell,\nwhere suffering knows no limit,\nand in the next life,\none is reborn as a beast.\nAfter the beastly rebirth,\none returns to human form,\nwith mutilated limbs,\nfoolish and dim-witted,\nunaware of human affairs,\ndespised by all,\n**hated by all**,\nforced into servitude.\nThen as a beggar,\nthe body festers with sores,\ninfested with lice and filth,\nclothing barely covering the skin,\nfood scarcely filling the mouth,\nsuffering hunger and cold with no recourse—\nuntil death in the wilderness,\ndevoured by ants or dragged by dogs,\nthe lonely spirit again sinks into hell.\n\nThe second is **wholesome karma**—\nwise and upright,\nhonest and fair,\nbringing joy to kin and neighbors,\nrespecting parents and deities,\nhonoring heaven and earth,\nloyal to the sovereign,\nrevering teachers and elders,\nloving friends,\nrefining desires,\nuntainted by greed or lust,\nthe Five Relationships unbroken,\nall matters considered with care—\nas well as those who dwell in mountain hermitages or cave retreats,\nwho endure hardship and humiliation,\nwhose **meditative stability** is not yet firm,\nwhose **Dao-practice** is incomplete—\nwhen their lives end,\nthey are reborn as officials of rank,\nas revered teachers and elders,\nor as those who enjoy inherited wealth,\nor who attain both longevity and fortune,\nliving in ease and splendor,\na life of unending happiness.\n\nThe third **business** is **pure karma**—\naspiring to sages and saints,\nseeking the **Daoist Immortals** and **Buddhas**,\nnurturing virtuous thoughts,\nspeaking wholesome words,\nacting in virtuous deeds,\nassociating with virtuous people,\nstanding on virtuous lands,\nholding virtuous things,\nwith solemnity and dignity,\nbody not moving recklessly,\nmind not wandering idly,\naiming for clarity,\naiming for stillness—\nwhen **meditative stability** is profound,\nthe **original spirit** serene and settled,\ndwelling perpetually in the **Crimson Chamber**,\nwithin the **Yellow Court**,\nin the **Golden Gate and Jade Hall**,\nall entanglements suddenly extinguished,\nall thoughts dissolved,\nseeing only the **true essence**,\nforgetting form and matter,\nforgetting realm and mechanism—\nthis is called **samadhi**,\na realm not to be trifled with,\nthe **Three Purity** realm of **unveiled luminosity**,\ntranscending the **Thirty-six Heavens** above,\npenetrating the **Seventy-two Realms** below,\n**freewheeling** beyond the **Three Realms**,\ntransforming within the **Five Phases** of nature.\n\nIn this **samadhi** state,\ndim and obscure,\ndark and silent,\nrevolving the heavens and earth,\nreturning to **Primordial Chaos**,\nall as one **Qi**,\nneither celestial nor terrestrial,\nnor human—\nineffable, indescribable,\nbeyond conception—\nsuddenly emitting **spiritual light**,\na wheel of **enlightened nature** surging forth.\n\nThe clear becomes **Heaven**,\nthe turbid becomes **Earth**,\nthe **harmonious Qi** within is the **Dharma-body**.\nIts wisdom pervades the **Three Realms**,\nilluminating the **Great Mystery**,\nno thing escapes its scrutiny,\nno matter remains unknown—\nno trace of obstruction,\nno thread of hindrance,\nno speck of defilement.\n\nAll **celestial beings, dragons, ghosts, gods, demons, and fiends**,\nall submit to its authority.\nThe **Yama King** beholds it and dares not raise his voice;\nthe **Night Marshal** bows in reverence, fists clasped in homage.\nWith **thin substance and no name**,\nthe **death ledger** bears no lineage—\neternal life in this world is attained.\n\nTeaching the **Dharma** and liberating beings,\nthe **spirit** ascends to

**interdependent transformation**,\nlie solely in the **movement and stillness of true mind**.\n\n**Stillness** is called **meditative power**,\n**true samadhi** is named **wisdom-light**.\nIf one does not first **kill the false mind**,\ncalm the **spirit** and settle the **qi**,\nhow can one attain the **Great Samadhi**?\nIf one cannot maintain **clarity and stillness**,\nhow can one enter **samadhi**?\nIf one cannot enter **samadhi**,\nhow can one generate **wisdom**?\n**Assembly of the Great**, when the mind is empty, the **spirit** is settled;\nwhen the **spirit** is settled, the light arises.\nIf **samadhi** lacks **wisdom**,\nit is but **yin spirit** overcoming **yang spirit**.\n\n**Wisdom** must arise within **samadhi**.\n**Wisdom** is the **Dharma-body**,\n**samadhi** is the **Buddha’s vessel**.\n**Assembly of the Great**, **samadhi** is the **home**,\n**precepts** are the **path**,\n**wisdom** is the **birth**.\nAll things, realms, and matters of this world are but **guests**.\nIf **samadhi** and **wisdom** mutually generate and flourish,\nentering the **Gate of All Marvels**,\nthen the **true essence’s** **spiritual penetration, wisdom, and insight** are fully cultivated,\nmanifesting luminosity.\nOne can respond to all things and matters,\nyet not be bound by them;\ncan traverse all worldly realms,\nyet not be deluded by them;\ncan escape **yin-yang,

**precepts**,\nnot daring to deviate in the slightest.\nWhen **insight** matures through prolonged contemplation,\n**clarity and stillness** naturally arise.\nThen, one proceeds to **enter stillness

it,\nThe Sea of Suffering endless, few bridges of dharma.\nAssembly, swiftly uphold the Three Hundred Precepts—\nEffortlessly, wisdom and samadhi rise above the waves.\"*\n\n**Eleven Secret Practices for True Cultivation**\n\nAssembly, since you have vowed to cultivate the True and become a Complete Reality Daoist, you must first distinguish clearly between true and false, penetrating their nature, before applying your efforts. To transform the false into the true with all your strength—that is the duty of those who cultivate.\n\nAssembly, listen now to what is false, so you may cultivate what is true.\n\nAssembly, even this body of yours is false—\na fleeting, illusory form of impermanence.\nThe six senses will surely decay,\nthe six cognitions will ultimately dissolve.\nQi passes through a thousand uses,\nyet when impermanence arrives, all ends.\n\nAssembly, have you not seen how mortals are born—\nnine chi in height, ten spans around the waist;\nfaces round as full moons, lips like crimson dots?\n\nEyes like polished lacquer, skin smooth as fine wax;\nCountenance noble and imposing, bearing fierce and commanding.\nSpeaking with eloquence, cunning in speech,\nA thousand stratagems, ten thousand schemes of guile.\nWise in letters, skilled in martial prowess,\nHigh-ranking officials and mighty generals—\nArtisans and talents, merchants and schemers,\nGrasping profit, contending for renown.\nGreedy for glory, striving for display,\nAmassing wealth like southern mountains’ treasure.\n\nIn painted halls, twelve golden hairpins—\nFlutes and zithers, songs and dances.\nOn jade steps, three thousand bejeweled slippers—\nBowing and curtsying, ever obsequious.\nGold and silver surpassing the Northern Dipper,\nJade feasts and brocade robes—\nAt every meal, delicacies beyond count;\nIn every gathering, refined etiquette in abundance.\n\nWhen wives reach half their years, they are cast aside for the new;\nConsorts in throngs, forgotten when vitality wanes.\nWealth piled high, vast fields as the foundation of prosperity;\nChildren thriving, yet one rank still feels too small.\n\nDay and night without rest, lost in flowers and lust;\nLove and greed without end, body weary, mind exhausted.\n\n「When scorching heat and dampness give way to cold winds,\nThe six pulses of yin and yang fall into disarray.\n\nChasing steeds and hunting game, the three souls scatter and flee—\nA thousand maladies assail, aging, sickness, and woe;\nA thousand calamities cling, weariness and exhaustion evermore.\n\nTaking *shēn* and *líng* in vain, they cry to heaven and earth but find no response—\nA thousand agonies defy utterance,\nTill one day the breath is cut, and they descend to the netherworld.\n\nStately in bearing, yet before the body cools, men turn away in disgust;\nAwe-inspiring in presence, yet once the eyes close, the face is turned to the sky.\n\nFour limbs bound in wood, a single corpse reduced to paper—\nNo sons to avenge, no consorts to follow.\n\nWhile the corpse yet lies cold, the living already plot—\nBrothers divide wealth and seize estates,\nWives and concubines hoard treasures for their own security.\n\nThose with children ponder how to live better;\nThose without sons scheme to remarry.\n\nGuests and carriages grow scarce at the door,\nAs the saying goes: *\"A man lives by his connections.\"*\n\nServants within steal and plunder,\nYet dare not speak, for *\"the fallen are preyed upon by their own.\"*\n\nWhen walls crumble and furniture is scattered, who cares?\nWhen fortunes fade, who knows?\n\nWanton wives and unworthy sons,\nEach attend to their own futures.\n\nWho has ever died and lived again?\nWho has ever gone and returned?\n\nBorn with empty hands, they die with nothing—\nThe mortal form returns to dust, the name vanishes into emptiness;\nThe paths of virtue and vice are clear, and retribution is manifest.\n\nBehold, this mortal guise—a phantom of illusion—\nIs it not all false?\n\nYet in their pursuit of wealth, noble rank,\nWives and concubines, grandchildren, honor and riches,\nNot a shred of true spirit remains—\nThis is no falsehood.\n\nWhere has this true spirit gone?\nPlainly, it is in the afterlife.\n\nIf it is plainly there, why cling to wives and children,\nTo riches and honor?\n\nThis is the dual path of virtue and vice—\nGuilt and reward, suffering and joy—\nAs real as shadow clinging to form.\n\nThe mortal body endures suffering and punishment—\nHow could there be the slightest escape?\n\nThus, you must regard the mortal form as light,\nThe *dharma-body* as heavy,\nUse the false to cultivate the true,\nPreserve the true and abandon the false,\nTo seek liberation from the sea of woe.\n\nYet without this mortal form,\nThere is no means to practice—\nThen the single spark of the *dharma-body*\nCannot act on its own,\nAnd falls back into the six realms of rebirth—\nThis would be labor in vain.\n\nSince we have attained human birth,\nEntered the Dao,\nWe must escape the cycle of rebirth—\nWhile sight and vigor remain,\nDiligently cultivate the true.\n\nHow does one cultivate?\nBy purifying the six senses’ gates of dust,\nHarmonizing the five *zàng* organs and five *qì*—\nThe true self abides in the *lingtái*,\nUnassailable by demons—\nPerforming countless good deeds,\nAnd uprooting the roots of sin.\n\nYet within this cultivation of the true,\nThere are two paths—\nSome true, some false,\nSome with effort, some without.\nThe *Vajra Sutra* says:\n*\"All conditioned things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows,\nLike dew, like lightning—thus they are.\"*\n\nThe *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* says:\n*\"Why do beings not attain the true Dao?\nFor they have deluded minds.\"*\n\nWhat these two scriptures teach\nReveals that conditioned practices are not the way.\n\nThere is one school that claims to *\"transfer essence and vitalize qi*,\nTo *\"merge life and prolong vitality*,\nTo *\"reverse aging and restore youth*,\nTo *\"achieve eternal life*—\nAll through clinging to form.\n\nAnd another that speaks of *\"raising lead and lowering mercury*,\nOf *\"forging the cauldron and burning the thatch*,\nOf *\"ingesting elixirs of immortality*,\nOf *\"swallowing talismans and feasting on vital qi*—\nThese too are *\"cultivating the true through the false*,\nAll manner of conditioned, deceptive practices—\nHow could they reveal nature and establish life,\nTo escape the cycle of rebirth?\n\nTo transcend birth and death,\nIt is not this way one emerges.\n\nCultivating the true through the false,\nOne must examine the great matter of life and death—\nTruly understand the path of the Dao.\n\nWhat is this path?\nIt lies in the harmony or discord of your single mind.\n\nIf in harmony, it follows its course;\nIf in discord, it answers to you.\n\nThe mortal body must die—\nWhether cultivated or not, it dies.\nEven if they live a thousand years,\nThey still return to dust—\nSo why the struggle?\n\nThe form has birth, it must decay;\nIt has a beginning, it must end;\nIt is shaped, it must dissolve;\nIt is gathered, it must disperse;\nIt comes, it must go;\nIt succeeds, it must fail;\nIt thrives, it must age.\n\nSince the body is born,\nIt must die.\n\nThe cultivation of transcending birth and death\nI speak of does not concern this body—\nIt merely uses it as a dwelling place,\nTo cultivate the *dharma-body* of heaven’s command.\n\nExternal teachings do not grasp this truth,\nAnd thus take the true as false,\nClinging to form—\nThey seek to preserve this blood-flesh body,\nTo make it unbreakable and undying—\nIs this not laughable?\n\nThe cultivation of transcending birth and death\nI speak of lies solely within this body’s true mind—\nIn the thoughts that move it,\nIn the deeds it performs.\n\nWhen deluded thoughts cease,\nThe *dharma-body* is born;\nWhen the *dharma-body* is still,\nHeaven’s mechanism stirs;\nWhen heaven’s mechanism moves,\nThe true light appears.\n\nIt is this true light that cannot be fully realized,\nThus, through this mortal form, we perform good deeds.\n\nYet good deeds too have true and false—\nClinging to form is false;\nNot clinging to form is true.\n\nObserve the Thus-Come-One—\nHe gives without clinging to form,\nHe performs merit without clinging to form,\nHe teaches without clinging to form,\nHe cultivates without clinging to form.\nHe emerges from the world without clinging to form—\nThus he can emerge from the world.\nBecause he can emerge from the world,\nHe can transcend birth and death.\n\nThe *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* says:\n*\"The highest virtue is non-virtue.\"*\nThis means non-attachment—\nOnly thus is liberation possible.\nHow then can one transcend birth and death?」\n\nThe years you gain are but few—\nmerely accumulating blessings, no more.\nWhen blessings are exhausted,\nyou still cannot escape the wheel of rebirth.\n\nAssembled ones, I urge you to follow the words of the Most High—\nonly when you transcend the body while the body remains,\nand follow the body while the body departs,\ncan you die without perishing.\n\nAssembled ones, set aside your mortal form—\ndo not cling to the agitation of *jing* and *qi*,\ncoveting their ascent and descent,\nthe unblocking of orifices,\nthe circulation of blood and vessels,\nto prolong life and ward off illness.\nIf you cling to these pursuits,\nyou will only fixate on the firmness of your fleshly body,\nreveling in ease and freedom,\nwhile neglecting your true nature for years without tending to it.\n\nYou do not know that one day,\nwhen the lesser demons catch you unawares,\nthey will suddenly drag you away.\nAt that moment, where will your *Dharmakāya* follow the waves?\nYour mortal form will sink into the muddy pit—\nall for naught.\n\nI exhort you to practice the secret work of subduing the mind and enduring with patience,\nso that you may soon see your true nature.\nWhy then would you fear your fate not standing firm?\n\nAssembled ones, I remind you—\nthe mortal form is but a dwelling,\nwhile the *Dharmakāya* is its inhabitant.\nIf the master possesses treasure,\nwhy should the dwelling not be orderly?\nIf the master falls ill or invites calamity,\nor is dragged away by fate,\nwhat use is this well-kept dwelling?\nWho will dwell in it then?\n\nI reveal another layer to awaken you—\nthe mortal form is a rented house, not owned.\nWhen the master departs, it returns to the earth,\nits elements dissolving back into the Four Great Ones.\n\nIf you secretly cultivate a *Dharmakāya* unclinging to form,\nwhy should you fear the mortal form not finding a proper end?\n\nAssembled ones, I offer my clumsy verses—\nlisten as I recite them:\n\n*\"The mortal form is the Dharmakāya’s house,\nWhen its depths are bright, its exterior shines.\nMay the master cultivate virtue and wisdom—\nWhy should the house not radiate splendor?\nFirst, the false must be dispelled,\nThe true *Dharma* requires casting off falsehood.\nDo not boast of non-attachment,\nDual-cultivate nature and life beyond impermanence.\nOnly when the mind is stilled can liberation be sought,\nThe phantom body set aside reveals the true self.\nClinging to life and fearing death—death must come.\nModifying form to seek the true—how can the true be attained?\nThe Thus-Come-One severed body and form,\nThe Jade Emperor once endured as a patient man.\nForgotten body, lost life for three thousand *kalpas*,\nAbandoning kingdom for mountain in eight hundred *xun*.\nThe Daoist clings to the false skin-bag,\nThrough countless *kalpas* and lives, never transcending dust.\nCease with intent, exhaust the spirit—\nForm, in the end, returns to the void.\nIf you lose sight of the true *Suchness*-nature,\nThe sea of suffering stretches endlessly.\nAlas, pitiful—\nLayered falsehoods within falsehood,\nIn vain learning the Whole Truth—how can the true be found?\nBirth, old age, sickness, sorrow, fear, and death—\nAt death, how different are you from the world’s folk?\nIn vain donning the yellow cap and feathered robes,\nHave you ever known the mechanism of life and death?\nSeeking food and clothing, wandering the world’s edge,\nGuilt and retribution cling—man turns to mud.\"*\n\nIf you do not realize that guilt and blessings are originally empty,\nthen birth and death’s wheel will never cease.\nIf you fail to awaken to the false and true within yourself,\nthen who will open the light of wisdom?\n\nAssembled ones, reflect deeply—\nlife and death are fleeting and swift.\n\nI have spoken of the secret practices—three hundred in number,\nwhich are the *Zhongji* Great Precepts in their minutiae.\nTo cultivate the body makes it upright,\nto cultivate the mind erases delusion.\nInternally applied, it brings sainthood;\nexternally applied, it brings kingship.\nYou may transcend the mundane and attain the fruit of purity and stillness,\ndeliver others from suffering,\nand end the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThe most critical aspect is the *secret*—\nwithout secrecy, you cannot achieve the Whole Truth.\nWithout the Whole Truth, the mind remains unclear,\nand an unclear mind cannot perceive the true nature.\n\nAssembled ones, how then is secrecy practiced?\nThe sage uses this to purify the heart and retreat into secrecy.\nSecrecy is the utmost vigilance—\nprecision leads to hidden concealment, the ultimate of secrecy.\n\nAssembled ones, for those who receive the *Zhongji* Precepts,\nthe first to the hundredth precepts are the great divine spells of purifying the body.\nHold these spells with reverence—\nyour body’s agitation must be entirely dispelled,\ntransforming into clarity and stillness,\nvanquishing recklessness and replacing it with steadiness.\nObserve the Four Great Comportments:\nwalk with measured steps,\nsit without leaning to one side,\nstand erect, never against walls or pillars,\nleaning on tables or walls.\nLie curled and sideways, never supine with loud breathing.\nEven a faint nasal sound must be adjusted—\ncultivate a demeanor of reverent propriety, called *external solemnity*.\n\nThe hundredth to the two-hundredth precepts are the great divine spells of purifying the mind.\nMerge these spells with the Dao through profound contemplation—\nyou must engage in secret, penetrating insight,\nreturning each thought to the true,\naligning each moment with the Way,\nnever slackening in word or deed.\nReflect again and again, awaken again and again—\nobserve distant things and examine your own self,\nstripping away chaotic and perverse thoughts until none remain.\nOnly when the true heart is serene and settled\ndo you proceed to the two-hundredth to the three-hundredth precepts,\nthe great divine spells of purifying intent.\nNot a thread may be leaked—\ntheir subtle mechanisms and flowing principles\nare hidden in the mysterious treasury of the arcane.\nSubtle and wondrous, beyond conception or description,\ngraspable only through divine insight, not through speech.\nThe supreme, effortless, wondrous Dao is thus exhausted.\n\nAssembled ones, this is the secret practice of cultivating the true.\nListen carefully to my final words—\nthe supreme Way must never be divulged.\n\nAssembled ones, to cultivate the true and escape birth and death—\nis this not an extraordinary matter?\n\nThe celestial mechanism, if not kept secret, will leak to the unworthy—\nthus, **Zhongyang Zhang Zhenren** was struck by Heaven three times for revealing it to the unworthy,\nand so it must never be divulged.\n\nWhat more, to transcend the wheel of rebirth,\nto leap beyond the world,\nand become a **True Person** unshaken through ten thousand kalpas—\nis this not what the **Heavenly and Earthly spirits** forbid,\nand what the **Yin and Yang** of creation resent?\n\nYet you now reverse fortune and act contrary,\nopposing the **Dao** of the world like ice and fire.\n\nYou must be cautious and thorough—\notherwise, your kin will not favor you,\nyour extended family will turn to enmity,\nyour wife and children will grow estranged,\nand your friends will lose faith,\nall because you lack the **bold and mighty resolve**,\nand thus abandon the **Dao-heart**.\n\n**Twelvefold Retribution and Erasure of Karmic Debt**—\nAssembled ones, since you have taken the **precepts of leaving home**,\nseeking the **path of liberation**,\nthe **deep-seated grudges** of a thousand lifetimes,\nthe **ancestral resentments** of generations,\nmust all be **confessed and purged**,\nnow and forever eradicated,\nso that **retributive suffering** may be cleansed.\n\nBut this is still the deed of the **lower vehicle** and **inferior retribution**,\nthe act of those fleeing debts and grudges,\nfearing death while clinging to life,\nthe **weak-willed and powerless** of lesser **Dao**.\n\nSuch a person’s **heart-mind** is unclear,\ntheir **inherent nature** yet unseen—\nthey only seek present gain,\nneglecting future lives.\nNow I speak to you of this **outer path**,\nso that you may know and understand.\n\nThere was once a **Daoist** who left home midway,\nwandering and seeking teachings,\nwho met several **fellow travelers**,\nand together vowed to **cultivate the Way**.\nThey built a **hermitage** on **Laoshan** in Shandong,\nbut later, due to war,\nthey descended together.\nAt **Wangwu Mountain** in Henan,\nthey sat alone in meditation.\n\nThough six resided there,\nthey were not of one resolve—\neach had their own **practice**.\nAfter one year,\nthree departed.\nThe remaining three renewed their vows,\nseeking **liberation** together.\n\nLater, one of them **passed in meditation**,\nand the other two grew even more resolute.\nThen another **passed in meditation**,\nleaving only one to **solitary cultivation**.\n\nWhile sitting in meditation,\nin **deep absorption**,\ntheir **spirit wandered** to **Tiantai Mountain**,\nwhere they suddenly encountered a **former Dao-friend** who had also **passed in meditation**.\nThe two rejoiced greatly.\n\nThe **former Dao-friend** said:\n*\"We have met by fate—\nI now must tell you:\nyou should revise the vow you took last year.\nI, at that time, vowed to **cultivate the Way**,\nto **confess and purge** my **karmic offenses**,\nand seek **deliverance**.\nYet when my **earthly life** was exhausted,\nat the **Third Heaven’s gate**,\nI was summoned before the **celestial officials**,\nwho loudly proclaimed:\n*'This person’s **karmic roots** remain—\nthey cannot escape their **kalpa**,*\n*their name is absent from the **Heavenly Register**,\n*their place is none on the **Elixir Peaks**—\n*they may not advance further,\n*but shall be appointed to the **Threefold Council** of **Yuntai Mountain**,\n*the **Capital of the Three Elements**.'*\n\n*Immediately, the **mighty winds** and **fierce qi***\n*sealed the **Heavenly Gate**,\nand I saw no way forward.\nMy body was sent to the **Threefold Council**,\nwhere I met the **Three Officials of the Netherworld**.\nThey examined my **karmic ledger**,\nand declared:\n*'You are of the **lower vehicle**, a **petty resolve** from a **side path**—\n*you dare to **transcend**?\n*Today, we spare you for your **ignorance on the wrong path**,\n*as the **mountain god of Tiantai and Tongbo** lacks a **post**,\n*so you shall temporarily **administer their duties**,\n*and when a **vacancy arises in the Netherworld**,\n*you will be **officially appointed**.'*\n\n*I then pleaded for instruction,\nso I might **cultivate in the underworld**,\nand the **Three Officials**, in their **merciful countenance**, commanded:\n*'When you sat on the **cushion** in meditation,\nyour **intent was not pure**,\nyour **mind was not empty**—\nyou had not **penetrated** the **truth that the colored body is empty**,\nthat **inherent nature is real**,\nnor had you **awakened** to the **non-emptiness within emptiness**.\nYou only knew that **karmic debts of a thousand lives** must be **confessed and purged**,\nthat **ancestral grudges of generations** must be **erased**,\nand that after **leaving home**,\nno **karmic debts or offenses** would arise again.\nYet you never **deeply investigated** or **fully awakened**—\nhow could **grudges and grudges** be **erased** from **inherent nature**,\nor **karmic offenses** be **confessed and purged**?\n\n*Who says that the **karmic roots** you have accumulated through kalpas,*\n*the **grudges** you have created in lifetimes past,*\n*can be **cleared** by a mere **utterance** or **thought**,\n*so that **karmic retribution** may vanish like **dust in the wind**?\n\n*You must first **enter the path** and **establish resolve**,\n*learn the **highest vehicle** and **great karmic roots**,\n*and take **universal salvation** as your aspiration.\nFor the **great vehicle of the highest path**,\nthe **common mind is instantly extinguished**,\nand **Heaven and Earth become empty**,\n**illusory forms** reduced to **ashes**—\nthen **self and others are one**,\nand only **ancestral karmic debts** and **deep-seated grudges** remain,\n**unable to be resolved**,\n**owing wealth and life**—\nhow can they be **dismissed lightly**?\n\n*Thus, the **Ancient Buddhas**, like **Ārya Rāja**,*\n*severed limbs to **repay past offenses**,\n*not omitting even a hair’s breadth,*\n*and only then **attained** the **Buddha Śākyamuni**.\n*The Sixth Patriarch*\n**washed away ancestral grudges**,\n**received even the subtlest karmic debts**,\nand only then **attained** the **Great Mirror of the Western Heaven**.\n\n*Yet you, with **petty resolve** and **weak roots**,\nrefuse to **repay karmic debts**,\nonly seeking to **escape suffering**—\nyou cling too firmly to the **colored body’s reality**,\nfearing **retributive encounters**,\n**punishment**, **beating**, **execution**, or **pain**,\nand your **one thought** is to keep the **colored body** ever **comfortable**.\nThis **fear of repayment for private gain** is your **weak root**,\nand it marks you as of the **lower vehicle**.\n\n*So long as **karmic roots** are not **empty**,\nthey will **rearise in future kalpas**,\nand **offenses remain**—\nin **later lives**, you will **encounter them again**.\nYou call yourself **one who has left home**,\nbut in truth, you are **fleeing suffering**.\nUnable to **escape suffering**,\nyou will be **entangled by kalpas**,\n**grudges extending through generations**—\nall because your **initial vow was weak**,\nand your **aspiration too narrow**.\n\n*This life, you have only **left home in name**,\n**cultivating merit** but not the **Dao**.\nYou should **enter the wheel of rebirth**,\n**transmigrate** to **reap merit**.\nYet because you once **recited** the **Supreme Emperor’s Scripture** (*Huangdi Fabao*) for a hundred volumes,\nand **chanted** the **Miracles of Amitābha’s Name** (*Mile Baohao*) for three years,\nwith **sincere and ardent devotion**,\nyou were **enrolled** as a **Zhengyi True Person**,\nand **deserve** the **rank of Netherworld Official**.\nNow, as you remain in the world,\n**acting as a sponsor** for scripture recitations,\nyou have not **failed** in your **karmic duties**.\nAs for **receiving wealth** from others,\nyou have also **distributed it** and **used it properly**—\nby **reason**, you should **advance in rank**,\nand **gain another stage**.\n\nThis register is **selected for enrollment** as a **Minister of the Celestial Peaks’ Mountain Spirit**, and you must **proceed at once** to **oversee its duties**. **In the unseen realm**, you shall **cultivate and refine**—do not **grow negligent**.\n\n*\"I then suddenly awoke to self-realization, regretting my limited aspiration. Only now do I grasp: small causes yield small fruits, great vows bring great rewards. My repentance comes too late—now I must enter your realm of **pure and enlightened spiritual insight** to speak with you.*\n\n*Since each must attend to their appointed duties, I dare not leave the mountain to wander. **Dao-friend**, your arrival is most timely—you must **renew your solemn vow**. For all **wronged kin**, you must **not shrink from retribution**, with **unwavering resolve**, only then can your fruit be great. If you harbor even a trace of **hesitation or fear**, you risk **karmic evasion**—and though you may gain your hands, your **fruit of attainment** will never be grand.\"*\n\nHaving spoken, the figure vanished.\n\nThe **Daoist adept** emerged from meditation, now recognizing this as merely a **self-serving, lower-grade heterodox** who would remain but a **mountain spirit** in the end. In haste, he **burned his thatched hut**, **slung his meditation cushion and staff**, and **once more turned inward** to **cultivate the mind**.\n\n**Enduring all humiliation**, **bearing all suffering**, **practicing all deeds**—\n**Dispelling all stray thoughts**, **forging body and mind**—\n**Vowing to resolve all karmic entanglements**, **unflinching before blade or axe**.\n**This fleshly form** is seen as **impermanent**;\n**This innate life** is held **pure and untainted**.\n\n**Unencumbered and unobstructed, undisturbed and unalarmed.**\n**Bare as the red flesh, radiant and bright, round and luminous, pure and naked—**\n**Coming and going with perfect ease.**\n\n**When fortune comes, he refuses to accept it;**\n**When suffering comes, he does not shirk it.**\n**With this singular resolve, he endured many years.**\n\n**Suddenly, one day, within his meditative stillness,**\n**A Daoist adept approached, bowing in reverence.**\n**Gazing upon him, it was the same disciple from before—**\n**The one who had first taken the path.**\n**His form remained unchanged, but his face bore shame,**\n**Daring not to meet the gaze above.**\n\n**Asked of his circumstances, he confessed:**\n**Once, he had followed his master’s perverse Dao,**\n**Ignorant of the true principle within.**\n**He had long directed his vital qi to the elixir field,**\n**And through prolonged practice, became a guardian of the corpse.**\n**His light extended but a foot in measure,**\n**Illuminating only his own skeletal frame—**\n**Beyond that, all remained in darkness,**\n**Revealing nothing.**\n\n**Now, because this Daoist adept entered stillness,**\n**His light expanded, drawing in the earlier departed disciple**\n**Into his meditative realm.**\n**In but a moment, he too vanished.**\n\n**Yet this later, still-living adept grew ever clearer in insight.**\n**For life resides within the nature—**\n**Each increment of understanding brings greater light;**\n**Each increase of light brings greater wisdom;**\n**Each growth of wisdom brings greater virtue and blessing;**\n**Each accumulation of virtue and blessing elevates the fruit of attainment.**\n\n**Thus, he emerged from meditation.**\n\nThis Daoist adept, questioning himself—\nthe six senses purged, the eight consciousnesses dissolved,\nthe five aggregates all emptied, the seven emotions severed—\nnow possessed the final refuge in the Eternal-Clear, Eternal-Still Great Heavenly Sovereign.\n\nYet, born of parents, nurtured by heaven and earth,\nthe mortal frame’s *qi* and fate had reached their limit.\nOn the next day, descending to the mountain’s outer gates,\nhe told the assembled disciples:\n*“Now I must take leave of you all—*\n*turning back to depart.”*\n\nThe crowd asked: *“Why depart so swiftly?”*\nThe adept replied: *“My three karmas are repaid,*\n*but the four debts remain unpaid.*\n*Only rebirth can fulfill this final resolve.”*\n\nWith hands clasped, he bowed in homage to the void—\nthen sat in final stillness.\n\nListen, all of you:\ntheir Dao may differ in correctness,\ntheir aspirations vary in scale.\nThese three—judging by their final insight,\ntheir fruit of attainment—\ndiffer vastly in rank.\n\nGreatness lies in the will.\nSmallness in the petty.\nA will unexpanded,\na heart unbroadened,\na capacity unwide—\nwishes narrow, scope confined,\nknowledge shallow, vision cramped—\nthen the *qi* one cultivates\nfills but a phantom skin-sack,\nnot the boundless *Tai Pei*,\nnot the heavens and earth,\nnot the sun and moon,\nnot all sentient beings.\n\nHow can this be called the Great Dao?\n\nBorn beneath heaven and earth,\nbathed by sun and moon,\nnurtured by parents,\nguided by ruler and teacher—\nthese are the four debts.\nTheir depth is boundless, their repayment impossible.\nYet still, one clings to the colored form,\ntrapped in the five aggregates’ suffering,\nstruggling to transcend.\nDual cultivation of virtue and wisdom\nremains but fleeting.\n\nNow that you have taken refuge in the Triple Jewel,\nwhy do you not transcend suffering?\nVirtue and wisdom are but the ocean of desire—\nthe ancients said:\n*“A thousand waves in the river of love,*\n*a million layers in the sea of desire.”*\nOnly when the waters dry and the waves cease\ncan the true nature’s source be revealed.\n\nYou must perceive the unity of all beings—\nfrom womb-born, egg-born, wet-born, or formed—\nnone without awareness.\nRecognize that self and other share the same source:\nthis is repaying heaven.\nEndless, vast compassion,\nbearing filth, enduring insult—\nall share the same breath:\nthis is repaying earth.\n\nThe nature of heaven is luminous,\nthe nature of earth is clear.\nTo the lost in darkness, speak the true word,\nbreaking their confusion.\nTo the drowning in delusion, preach the Dharma,\nremoving their obstacles—\nthis is repaying sun and moon.\n\nFollow the teacher’s instructions,\nobey the state’s laws,\nrevere the sovereign’s decrees—\nnever overstep bounds,\nnever violate virtue or custom.\nUphold the pure precepts,\nhonor the sacred texts,\npray for the emperor’s longevity,\npreserve the imperial mandate.\nPass this on to future generations,\nproclaiming the true Dao—\nthis is repaying ruler and teacher.\n\nThe body comes from parents:\ndo not soil even a hair.\nEliminate self and other’s attachments,\natoning for the sufferings of the dark realm.\nRepay past parents’ toil,\ndissolving the bonds of countless lives.\nEase the present family’s hardships,\natoning for every transgression.\nOnly by exhausting this mortal form\ncan filial piety know no end.\nIf parents are not liberated,\none cannot attain the True.\n\nRevere all beings’ parents as your own,\nlove all children as your own flesh.\nThus, the Seven Mysteries ascend,\nthe Three Dynasties soar—\nthis is repaying parents.\n\nYet if your heart remains obstructed—\nhow can you perceive the Three Pure Ones,\nthe Jade Emperor, the Three Officials and Four Saints,\nthe Five Elders and Seven Worthies?\n\nYou still divide self and other,\nclinging to ignorance.\nYour chest is narrow—\nyou cannot endure a single matter.\nYour capacity is small—\nyou cannot contain even one person.\nYou judge without discernment,\ndistorting right and wrong.\nPraise brings joy, insult brings rage.\nYour resolve is shallow,\nyour thoughts unilluminated.\nYour heart lacks tolerance,\nyour body grows sluggish.\nYou dismiss minor losses as trivial,\nboast of fleeting virtues—\nhow can you repay heaven, earth, ruler, teacher, or kin?\n\nTo repay heaven and earth’s debt,\nyou must know their Dao,\nembody their heart,\ngrasp their principle,\nrealize their virtue.\nIn the darkest chamber, deceive none—\nsever all delusive emotions.\nWith wisdom’s light universally shining,\nall defilements are truly borne.\nIn loss, take loss—\nno trace of self remains.\nIn suffering, endure suffering—\nno trace of deceit lingers.\nPractice is sincere,\nthe realm is luminous.\nVirtue profound, the Dao exalted—\nghosts and spirits bow in reverence.\nSpirit clear, wisdom awakened—\nall things submit, people return.\nAbove, you commune with the Celestial Throne;\nbelow, you command the thunderbolts.\nIn drought, pray for rain to nourish the people;\nin flood, pray for clear skies to lift the calamity.\nDemons and spirits cower and flee.\nAbove, bless the eternal fortress,\nthe emperor’s boundless years;\nbelow, bless the land’s songs,\nthe people’s joyous labor.\n\nThis is to uphold the ancestral tradition,\nto spread the Dao’s transformation.\n\nAs for your parents—\nten months in the womb,\nthree years at the breast—\ntheir toil was boundless, their love profound.\nWhen grown, they hoped for filial care in old age,\nfor their lineage’s glory.\nThe ruler, in sleepless vigil,\noversees the six ministries and nine officials,\ngoverning and transforming,\nsuppressing evil, upholding virtue,\nhonoring the worthy, valuing the virtuous—\nhow shallow their merit could be?\n\nYou now dwell at home yet cannot properly honor and nourish your parents,\nnor, when in service, can you aid the state with wise counsel.\nYour robes are bestowed by the charity of countless households,\nyour meals rely on the labor of ten thousand farmers.\n\nYet you drift like waves on the tide,\nall day long in idle confusion,\nidle hands, idle mouths,\nmuttering nonsense,\nneither cultivating virtue nor adhering to precepts.\nWhen you act, you violate the rules;\nyour mind is clouded, your spirit scattered.\n\nAscend the altar to pray for the nation—\nthe spirits and gods refuse to descend.\nDrive away demons and purify the land—\nplagues and calamities remain unhealed.\nYour talismans hold no power,\nyour supplications are in vain.\n\nThe lowly among you, when struck by drought or flood,\nblame the wind and curse the rain,\nhate the earth and resent the heavens,\nroam recklessly, and in defiance,\noffend your kin and break the laws.\nSee the ox, horse, donkey, and mule,\nthe pig, sheep, dog, and swine—\neach possesses five senses and six orifices,\nthe interplay of yin and yang, male and female,\nawareness and vitality.\nYet today, they speak only because of this one mouth.\n\nAh! At that time, the Master of Precepts proclaimed this gatha:\n\n*\"With wisdom and insight both refined,\nthe precepts pure, heaven and hell clearly known.\nNot a thread of clinging—light forever bright,\na thousand burdens cast off—mind at ease.\nLife’s mandate from Heaven, unalterable fate,\nto transcend birth and death, sincerity is key.\nFalse paths and deceptions multiply like branches—\nI urge all to awaken to the true and pure.\n\nThe four debts unpaid bring shame,\nthe three defilements remain—Dao unfulfilled.\nTo repay the four debts, first guard the precepts,\nto dissolve the three defilements, cultivate the True.\n\nGuard the precepts and walk the righteous Way,\ncultivate the True and fathom life’s fleeting show.\nWhen life’s illusion is seen through,\nthe three defilements fade—repay the four debts.\nTo escape the world and leave the home,\ngreed, anger, delusion cling—true liberation far.\n\nWhen worldly passions are exhausted, the heart grows pure,\nwhen true nature shines, the Dao draws near.\nWho is real when the colored form is seen through?\nWho knows true life when all things are observed?\nNot a thread of attachment—three minds released,\nthe ten precepts fully embraced, free and unbound.\"*\n\n**Thirteen Resolutions and Vows**\n\nPeople of the Assembly,\nfrom ancient sages to immortals and Buddhas,\nthey saw through worldly illusions—all conditioned things,\nall forms as empty and false.\nThus they sought to transcend the mundane,\nto escape birth and death,\nto retreat into the mountains,\nto forget the body and perish the self,\nall in pursuit of the ultimate Dao.\n\nYou know only the names of sages, immortals, and Buddhas,\nyet not their true essence.\nYou all desire to become sages, immortals, or Buddhas,\nyet have not truly taken the vow to do so.\nYou all wish to attain their fruits,\nyet do not cultivate their causes.\nYou all aspire to their station,\nyet lack the resolve to make it so.\n\nThus, though your words may speak of the Dao,\nyour heart does not understand.\nFor the Dao remains unclear when no master of truth is met,\nand the Dao cannot be practiced without those who walk its path.\n\nThose who merely claim the name \"Daoist\"—\nhave they ever grasped its profound essence?\nThose who call themselves \"Perfect Truth\"—\nwho truly embodies its reality?\nNo wonder filial piety decays,\nno wonder ancestral traditions wither.\n\nNow that you have taken refuge in the Three Jewels\nand upheld the precepts,\nyou have indeed met a master of truth.\nBut to truly walk the Dao,\nyou must follow my true words\nand act as sages, immortals, and Buddhas do.\nOnly then are you practitioners of the Way.\n\nPeople of the Assembly,\nbefore sages, immortals, and Buddhas attained the Dao,\nthey were no different from you—ordinary mortals,\nno extra eyes, no added hands.\nYet they possessed resolve:\nto seek the path of transcendence,\nto understand the nature of birth and death.\n\nThis resolve alone set them apart—\na hundredfold brighter, a thousandfold broader.\nThough their bodies remained mortal,\ntheir minds already bore the mark of the sage.\n\nBut sages do not merely speak of transcending the world;\nthey truly harbor such thoughts in their hearts\nand act accordingly.\nThus they are called \"Great Heroes,\"\nendowed with great compassion.\n\nTrue men, teachers of heaven and earth,\nare made by their resolve—uncommon from the start.\nTheir deeds are mighty:\nwith wisdom-swords gleaming on their shoulders,\neyebrows raised like lightning bolts;\nwith precept-blades at their throats,\neyes flashing like thunder.\n\nHeretics tremble in fear and flee,\nevil winds quake and seek refuge.\nAscending to the Nine-Graded Lotus Platform,\nthey take their place upon the Law-King’s throne.\nTheir words resound as pure Dharma,\ncleansing all who hear.\nTheir bodies emit sacred *qi* and fragrant elixirs,\nliberating all who behold.\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, their great resolve fulfilled,\nthey vow anew:\nto abandon self, others, life, and all attachments.\nNot to enlighten themselves alone,\nbut to enlighten all beings.\nWith the method of self-liberation,\nthey universally save all sentient life—\nyet never demand that others possess their own resolve.\n\nThey take the common heart as their own.\nFor the common folk are but another name for sentient beings,\nand sentient beings are our own kind.\nWith the law of our kind,\nwe save our kind.\nWithout enlightenment for all,\nthere is no attainment of the Dao.\n\nThe *Qingjing Jing* says:\n*\"Though named as one who has attained the Dao,\nin truth, nothing is gained.\nTo transform sentient beings is to attain the Dao.\nThose who awaken may pass on the sacred teaching.\"*\n\nPeople of the Assembly,\nsages, immortals, and Buddhas differ not from mortals.\nThe difference lies only in public and private:\nthe sage acts with fairness and impartiality,\nfor others, not for self;\nthe common man acts with deceit and selfishness,\nfor self, not for others.\n\nThe sage is but clear and serene, the common man but murky and restless.\nThe sage wields inner firmness to discipline the self,\nouter gentleness to serve others;\nthe common man uses inner softness to excuse himself,\nouter harshness to blame others.\nThe sage ever fears his own faults,\nthe common man only accuses others’ errors.\n\nWhere the sage treads with care,\nthe common man steps into peril with reckless abandon.\nThe sage, though not yet dead,\nfirst understands the workings of death’s aftermath;\nthe common man, even facing death,\nstill clings to fleeting life’s calculations.\n\nThe sage seeks the *out-worldly Dao*,\nrefining worldly affairs to purify the heart—\nas a son, he fulfills filial duty,\nas a subject, he fulfills loyalty;\nthe common man knows neither *out-worldly Dao* nor even worldly law,\nhow could he know to be loyal to his lord or filial to his kin?\n\nPitiful are these deluded, unaware masses,\nwho neither grasp worldly law nor *out-worldly Dao*.\nDay and night they drift in drunkenness and dreams,\nliving in vain, dying in vain—\nborn in the morning, dying by evening,\nstealing life, fearing death,\nblindly living, blindly dying.\n\nThey bury their true spirit and nature in this foul skin-bag,\nendlessly wandering through countless *kalpas*,\nunaware of their inversion,\nflipping and turning,\nchanging faces and forms,\nendless cycles of rebirth,\nnever knowing when they might escape.\n\nAssembly,\nif you have already received the *precepts*,\nthen you have already escaped.\n\nTo escape is to leave suffering,\nto leave suffering is to leave the world.\n\nAssembly,\nto leave suffering, first you must endure it.\nIf you do not endure suffering, you cannot leave it.\n\nYou must heed the true words of sages, immortals, and Buddhas,\nnot merely chase their hollow names.\nYou must establish the resolve of sages, immortals, and Buddhas,\nnot idly speak of their fruits.\nYou must plant the roots of sages, immortals, and Buddhas,\nthen naturally reap their rewards.\nYou must accumulate the *virtue/power* of sages, immortals, and Buddhas,\nthen naturally attain their Dao.\nYou must act in their manner,\nthen naturally realize their station.\n\nIf you act without principle and speak beyond truth,\nyou remain but a stagnant common man.\nTo vainly imagine the Dao of sages, immortals, and Buddhas—\ncould such a spiritless one ever walk it?\n\nAssembly,\nyou must set great resolve and vow great aspiration,\nonly then may you escape the world.\n\nThus the *gāthā* is spoken:\n\n*\"Hear my words, O precept-holder, with resolve set firm,\nfor resolve can free you from birth and death.\nFirst endure suffering to discipline mind and body,\nfor when suffering ends, sweetness comes—death becomes rebirth.\nWith resolve, clear your heart of dust and delusion,\nand reverse the common world’s inverted ways.\nHold aloft the staff of the *Great Void*,\nunshaken on the *White Jade Platform* of true space.\nDo not wish for *action* to become *external Dao*,\nnor for *inaction* to stray into false teaching.\nNeither void nor full in balanced aspiration,\nneither existence nor nonexistence in awakened practice.\n\nSet resolve unmoved by shifting conditions,\nthough dangers rise, your heart remains undisturbed.\nWith heart’s law, you turn the realm of senses—\nwisdom’s light spreads when heaven’s gate opens wide.\nSet resolve unmoved by worldly things,\nfor when moved by them, you lose your true nature.\nOnce power and authority slip from your grasp,\nthe demon’s hand turns you—regret comes too late.\n\nSet resolve unshaken by worldly affairs,\nfor stubbornness clings like a fettering rope.\nWhen reason is clear and affairs understood,\nobstacles dissolve into void.\nLiberated in true space, illusions vanish.\n\nSet resolve unshaken by what the ears hear,\nfor within the ear-root lies the true teaching.\nGuard against sound’s leakage that clouds true nature,\nfirst endure hardship to seal your ears’ hearing.\n\nSet resolve unshaken by what the eyes see,\nfor within the light lies the birth of emptiness.\nGuard against light’s dissipation that scatters vital spirit,\nwhen sight is gone, the heart alone rules.\n\nSet resolve unshaken by what the mouth speaks,\nfor merging with the Dao, speech returns to nature.\nWhen teaching is spoken, no words are needed—\nno words, no speech, yet *qi* flows unbroken.\n\nSet resolve unshaken by what the tongue tastes,\nfor harming life, killing beings, spirits and demons forbid.\nGolden nectar, jade essence, fragrant *sāmbhava*—\ndivine waters, sweet as *gāndhāra*, quench the thirst.\nSet resolve unshaken by what the nose smells,\nfor worldly scents stir false desires that corrupt true constancy.\nSince you have freed yourself from the scent of heaven,\neach has their own heart-scent to offer the sky.\n\nSet resolve unshaken by the body’s wild movements,\nfor always guard decorum, never slack in reverence.\nFilial disobedience taints and corrupts the root of the Dao—\nthe essence of the Dao is upright, strict, and respectful.\n\nSet resolve unshaken by the heart’s defiance of nature,\nfor anger and rage have no origin.\nSubdue your heart and follow reason’s path,\nfor harmony’s breath dissolves all, and the spirit rejoices.\n\nSet resolve unshaken by the will’s fickle changes,\nfor sincere intent must be steadfast in every moment.\nNo double thoughts in the heart, no other intentions in the mind—\nguard your solitude with sincerity, and return to unity’s vow.\n\nSet resolve unshaken by love’s entangling bonds,\nfor love’s fetters bind like ropes and snares.\nYou must uproot love’s roots utterly,\nand cut off all sprouts to board the *Dharma-boat*.\n\nSet resolve unshaken by reckless, inferior companions,\nfor such companions are fleeting like wind.\nWithdraw from them, lest their *Dao-thought* extinguish your true heart,\nand their corruption taint the sacred teaching.\n\nSet resolve unshaken by blind guides,\nfor the six senses and six dusts do not anchor the mind.\nDo not cling to one method to perceive true nature,\nfor *external Dao* and false paths cannot liberate you.\n\nFirst, set resolve to receive the *initial true precepts*,\nfor holding the ten *precepts* keeps the heart unbroken.\nSubdue your heart and guard the *disciplinary laws*—\nnever stray, for the four *Great Elements* demand constant reverence.\n\nNext, set resolve to receive the *middle precepts*,\nfor secret practice and subtle movement lead to *self-liberation*.\nWhen the physical body is dissolved into *Dharma-body*,\nthe three *bodies* are realized beyond *kalpa’s* bounds.\n\nSet resolve to repay kindness with fervent heart,\nfor the four *Great Elements*’恩 is profound—you must sever it.\nWith body and life, repay deep kindness,\nand filial sons, loyal subjects will delight heaven and earth.\n\nSet resolve to cultivate true essence, first casting off pretense,\nfor you dare not feign deafness or dumbness.\nWith true heart and sincere intent, never deceive—\neven a hint of falsehood makes you a donkey, cow, or horse.\n\nSet resolve to sever killing, theft, and lust,\nfor wine, sex, wealth, and *qi* are the roots of greed, delusion, and rage.\"*\n\nThe six desires and seven emotions are the three poisons—\nforever sever rebirth, lest the self be lost in delusion.\n\nSet resolve not to cultivate the middle or lower paths,\nfor clinging to merit brings only finite reward.\nThe Great Vehicle’s path of serene liberation,\nthe supreme path—set resolve to fulfill its vow.\n\nSet resolve to endure hardship without retreat,\nto extinguish myriad faults and countless sins.\nWith wisdom bright and virtue vast as heaven and earth,\nstand firm in the boundless Dao.\n\nSet resolve to take refuge in precept, meditation, and wisdom,\nthe unobstructed path of the highest teaching.\nUnobstructed, unobscured—great radiance—\nunsoiled, untainted, without fear.\n\nThe path beyond birth and death, transcendent and unchanging,\nneither annihilation nor increase, no opposites.\nNo form, no action, no rank or bearing,\nno limit, no exaltation, no supreme nobility.\n\nRising beyond the Three Realms to the Three Purity,\nascending to the *Vimalocana* realm with *dharma-qi* and *mystic light*.\nSet resolve to take refuge in the Original Beginning’s Lord,\nthe Dao’s scriptures, the teacher’s treasures—my heart’s mirror.\n\nMy heart’s resolve transcends dust and *kalpas*,\nawakening to the unchanging body and mind.\nWith vow, I pledge to abandon all emptiness and deceit,\nto offer body and life to the void,\nmy thoughts to *Suchness*—void of illusion.\n\nI vow to learn the supreme path,\nmy heart unattached to all forms.\nThe six senses purified, the six dusts dispelled—\nI reverently follow the Imperial Scripture, first severing obstacles.\n\nI vow to dissolve emotions and cognition, awakening to the true principle,\nnot letting the supreme treasure turn with demons.\nI vow to offer heart and life to emptiness,\nnot letting nature and life wander aimlessly.\n\nI vow to transcend birth and death beyond the world,\nthe Dharma-realm vast and boundless, the Dharma-body great.\nThe Dharma-body perfect, the Dharma-realm void—\nthe true void, boundless and unobstructed.\n\nI vow to liberate myself from birth and death,\nto self-liberate and liberate others without distinction.\nI vow to universally liberate all beings,\nas myself, all sentient beings alike.\n\nI vow my heart steadfast, my resolve complete,\nto grasp the true mechanism and reverse it.\nBlades and axes may wound the body—I do not flinch,\nfloods and fires may scorch the *dharma-qi*—my heart does not soften.\n\nThrough the three calamities, eight hardships, and five sufferings,\nI vow to bear them all, never resisting.\nThough my power may falter, my resolve shall not crumble—\nno celestial demon can obstruct.\n\nEven through the ninety-six *kalpas* of sun’s decline,\nwhen the body decays and form perishes, my vow remains.\nThough stone crumbles and seas dry, my heart does not fail—\nmy vow, the adamantine resolve of wisdom and insight.\n\nEven if cast into the Avīci hell,\nI will endure karmic retribution without retreat.\nI vow to bear the causes of my own sins,\nwith patient endurance, my suffering complete.\n\nI vow to awaken to the unbegun, deluded nature,\nto enter the unexhausted, ever-serene stillness.\nI vow to offer my liver and gall to the Three Realms,\nto enter the unobstructed great mirror of light.\n\nI vow with compassion to save all sentient beings,\nto become the virtuous physician healing the world’s ailments.\nI vow to pilot the boat of mercy across the sea of suffering,\nto liberate all beings from the realm of illusion.\n\nHeaven, earth, and all things—all true,\nthe Original Beginning’s *qi*—all divine.\nThe sages, immortals, and Buddhas—all sincere—\nI urge all to follow the path of liberation,\ntogether escaping the dust of mundanity.\n\n「Assembled ones, the resolute spirit you have taken up,\nthe grand vows you have proclaimed—now I exhort each and all,\nwith every step, and every word of caution.\n\nYou, my disciples of the Dao/Way’s sublime transformation,\nmy children of the宗宗 *wind* and宗宗 *virtue/power*,\nmy young souls continuing the Dao/Way’s lineage,\nmy adepts breaking the celestial barriers—\n\nAcross the ten *zhou* and three *dao* islands,\nall have heard, all have known.\nEach must ponder deeply—\nprepare swiftly, for a determined vow is your greatest gain.\n\n*Ah!* If this body does not attain liberation in this very life,\nthen in what future life shall it be freed?\n\nTime flies like an arrow, the sun and moon like a shuttle—\nfrom your ordination till now,\nyou have wasted years, squandered days,\nyour hair like frost, your skin wrinkled with lines,\nyour teeth falling out, your sinews stiff and skin slackened.\n\n*Alas!* When bones grow soft,\nyou cannot journey far;\nwhen blood is drained,\nyour strength cannot bear weight.\n\nWhen essence is exhausted and kidneys decay,\nyour eyes grow dim and blurred;\nwhen spirit flags and mind goes wild,\nyour soul is restless and unmoored.\nWhen vital breath fades yet the corpse remains,\nyour ears droop in feeble hearing;\nwhen stomach is strong yet spleen is weak,\nyour appetite wanes and fails.\n\nAssembled ones, know this body is but an illusion—\nno matter how firm, death’s day is certain,\nonly differing in early or late arrival.\n\nLike this: deaf ears, blind eyes, parched tongue,\nfalling teeth, trembling gums,\naching waist, hunched back,\nsnow-white hair, scorched brows—\nwhen sinews grow rigid, limbs numb,\nwhen resolve weakens and heart grows cold,\nthese are the summons from the Lord of Death,\nawaiting your arrival.\n\nDo not cling to the petty heart of a housewife,\nthe shallow mind of a bean-curd merchant,\nthe narrow vision of a dwarf,\nthe deluded stupor of a beast—\nonly fixated on the present,\nheedless of the life to come.\n\nIf now the ghosts should summon you,\nand you refuse to endure,\nyou must go—\nhow then can you be called a Daoist,\none who has renounced the world?\nCan you escape, can you evade?\n\nWhy not look deeply, seek liberation early?\n\nTo act with decisive resolve,\nto let go with a single step—\nthis is the mark of a true *dàzhàngfū* (great man),\na singular *qí nánzǐ* (extraordinary man).\n\nResolute spirit, with skillful means,\nto ordain and practice the Dao/Way.\nOtherwise, you are but a cowardly mind,\na flaccid visage.\n\nThe four *great elements*—wind, fire, earth, water—\neach now in their own relentless course.\nThe lifetime’s clarity of sight and hearing—\nall dispersed among the masses.\n\nMurmuring, drifting, swaying, sinking—\ninto the depths of hell you go.\n\n*Ah!* Assembled ones, without resolve in practice,\nyou are but puppets in a play—\nwhen the drums and gongs cease,\nwhere shall you go?\n\nOnly with resolve can you transcend the world;\nwithout it, a thousandfold difficulty.\n\nTo establish resolve in cultivating the Dao/Way of true spontaneity,\nwhereby great *virtue/power* and spirit are not trifled—\n\nThe fourteen *yìn* (seals) verify its efficacy.\nChildren of the Dao, if you seek the wondrous Dao/Way of\n*qīngjìng* (serene stillness) and *wúwéi* (non-action),\nyou must have resolve—\nto be truly free.\n\nIf you can walk in freedom,\nthen the Dao/Way’s natural order is within you.\nIf you cannot walk in freedom,\nhow can you be free?\nIf you cannot even master worldly affairs,\nhow can you attain freedom?\n\nThe *xian* masters say:\n*\"To cultivate the Dao/Way of immortality,\nfirst cultivate the Dao/Way of humanity.\nIf the Dao/Way of humanity is unmastered,\nthe Dao/Way of immortality is distant indeed.\"*\n\nThe Confucian schools teach:\n*\"First bring order to your family,\nthen you may govern the state.\"*\n\nOrdering your family is like mastering the Dao/Way of humanity,\ngoverning the state is like cultivating the Dao/Way of immortality.\nIf you cannot order your family,\nhow can you govern the state?\n\nThe Buddhist *shì* (teachings) declare:\n*\"You must exhaust the mind of the mundane,\nelse there is no awakening to the sacred.\"*\n\nThis mundane mind holds the *sāṃghī* (threefold discipline) of\n*three bonds* and *five constants*—\nif you follow it to completion,\nthe Dao/Way of humanity is fulfilled,\nand the Dao/Way of immortality is no longer difficult.\n\nThough you may not become a sage, a true Daoist, or a Buddha,\nit is still easy enough.\n\nHow then should you advance in the Dao/Way of immortality?\nChildren of the Dao, from your entry into the *xuánmén* (mysterious gate),\nstudying to be Daoists,\nbowing to masters and receiving their precepts—\nyou then sit in meditation, quieting your mind,\nbelieving the Dao/Way of mundane humanity is exhausted,\nthat the Dao/Way of immortality is soon to come.\n\nYet you have not exhausted your heart’s reverence for your master,\nnor can you distinguish the transmitted *kōujué* (oral precepts)\nfrom their opposites—\nand you dare to act without foundation.\n\nNo sooner have you begun\nthan you seek its verification.\nAfter three days or two,\nseeing no signs of progress,\nyou abandon it.\n\nYou then seek another master,\nreceive two phrases of instruction,\nand sit again.\nThis fleeting impulse toward the Dao/Way\nlasts no more than two or three days,\nthen you seek verification once more—\nyour very thoughts cannot be steadied.\n\nSuch is the confusion of your mind, the shallowness of your wisdom—\nin vain do you practice a thin veneer of cultivation,\nendlessly pondering,\nyour spirit unable to settle,\nyour efforts but a dream.\n\nAfter twenty or thirty years of sitting,\nyou remain but a mundane mortal—\nand at death, you still do not know it.\n\nWhat a pity—\ntime wasted like water beneath a moon’s reflection,\ngrasping at flowers in a mirror,\nthinking it easy, yet never attaining.\n\nThere are no shortcuts to the Dao/Way of immortality.\n\nPitiful are those who follow blind masters,\nwho are deceived by external *dào* (teachings).\nI will not speak further.\n\nOnly I urge you:\nTake the chapter of *precise discipline and conduct* as your foundation,\nestablish resolve in repaying kindness,\nand repeatedly reflect on these matters.\nFirst purify your thoughts,\nremove the afflictions of *mùmíng* (deluded ignorance).\n\nWith a single mind toward the Dao/Way,\ntake refuge in the *sāṃbhoga* (Three Treasures),\nrecite the true *sūtra* (scriptures),\nfollow the *lǜ* (precepts) in practice—\nsit for a hundred days in the *shí fāng táng* (ten-direction halls),\nyour outward demeanor dignified,\nyour corporeal form stable,\nall affairs in order,\nyour body upright and composed.\n\nThen perform the rites of respectful homage,\ninvite the true *shìzhēn* (authentic teacher),\nand vow not to study the *zhōng xià èr shèng* (middle and lower two vehicles).\nWith resolute heart, you pledge:\n*\"I wish to hear the Dao/Way of supreme,\nnatural liberation—\nthe serene stillness of the unexcelled *dà shèng* (great vehicle),\nwhereby I may comprehend birth and death,\nand forever escape the wheel of *lúnhuí* (reincarnation).\"\nOnly then may you receive the *shíyìn* (ten seals) of *chūzhēn* (initial truehood).」\n\n**Assembly, how is this so?**\n\nThe *Dao* begins with transforming *qi* and essence—\nonly after hearing the *Dao* may one ascend to the *pútuán* (cushion),\ncalm the mind and still the thoughts,\ncut off speculations and forget emotions,\ncultivate the mind with earnest effort,\nand abandon all worldly affairs entirely.\n\nThen, one must grasp the *Zhuǎnshòu Zhōngjí Sānbǎi Dàjiè* (the Three Hundred Great Precepts of Transmission and Reception),\ndeliberating them deeply,\npenetrating and mastering them thoroughly,\nonly then understanding the profound causes and conditions:\nthey lie within the body,\nnot outside the mind.\n\nIn secret, one must penetrate the truth with sincerity,\nperfect the wondrous practices,\nand verify the voidness of naturalness—\neven at the hundred-foot staff’s height,\nthere remains further progress.\n\nOne must not twist the crooked into straight,\nnor forcefully argue what is unknown.\nWhen recognizing a few *dàochǎng* (Dao/Way places),\nor securing a single hermitage or monastery,\nand taking in one or two disciples,\none should not already deem oneself content,\narrogant, and neglect the precepts of virtue, discipline, and wisdom.\n\nNor should one imitate the *lǜzhǎng* (precept masters) or *jièshī* (disciples of virtue),\nmaintaining solemn decorum and strict discipline,\nyet refuse to harmonize with fellow adepts of the same *mén* (gate/door).\n\nIlliterate in the scriptures,\nhalf-understanding the principles,\nthe self has not yet fully transformed—\nyet one boasts grandly to others,\n*\"We practice the supreme vehicle’s methods!\"*\n\nSeizing a fan, one scribbles a few lines of *dānyǔ* (alchemical speech).\nHanging a pouch,\none fills it with several *dānjīng* (alchemical scriptures).\nCarrying a gourd,\none gathers many herbs,\nstuffing them inside,\nthen swindles common folk of their silver,\nclaiming *\"the Immortal’s transmitted elixir prescriptions from the Sea\"*—\ntaking the silver,\nbuying wine and meat.\n\nWith reckless babble,\none speaks of *yīnyáng* (yin-yang) pulse principles,\nyet fails to grasp them truly,\nrandomly collecting a few prescriptions,\npretending to achieve merit.\n\nAll day long,\none prattles endlessly,\ndiscusses heaven and earth,\nruns hither and thither,\nseeking clothes and food.\n\n「They corrupt the **Tàishàng** (Supreme Vehicle) teachings,\ndefiling the **Quánzhēn** (Complete Reality) reputation.\n\nThe lawbreakers, the transgressors of precepts,\nsinners sowing seeds of guilt—\nwhen their evil deeds fill to the brim,\nthe **Tiāncáo** (Celestial Tribunals) will surely hold them accountable,\ncasting them into endless hells,\na pitiful and agonizing fate!\n\nAnd there is another sort:\nthose who have just entered the Dao/Way’s gate,\nwith petty aspirations and narrow vows,\ncontent only with sitting in meditation to seek ease,\nunwilling to humble their hearts,\nsubdue their **qi**,\nsever attachments,\nor cut off emotions—\ninstead, they cling to the muddy and watery,\nto forms and lingering thoughts.\n\nThey fixate on the immediate effects of their practice,\nmanipulating **qi** to gather essence,\ninducing **zhāojiào** (spiritual openings) through daze,\nmistaking thieves for their own sons—\nyet they never awaken.\n\nRefusing to cultivate an open heart,\nthey never seek true verification,\nnor observe, visit, or inquire deeply.\nWhen they reach the stage of **huànshú** (illusory attainment),\nthey become irredeemable.\nMany then fall into self-pity,\ndegenerating through endless cycles of rebirth.\n\nThey treat the **Wújí Dàodào** (Ultimate Dao of the Boundless) as mere flesh and blood,\nmistaking **shízhen** (cognitive spirit) for **yuánshén** (original spirit),\nand follow its illusions—\nhow could they ever transcend life and death?\n\nAll you disciples,\nheed my words—\nsweep away these **pángmén zuǒdào** (side paths),\n**xiéfǎ qízhī** (heterodox methods and branches),\nand cast them aside without hesitation.\n\nRefine your body, heart, and mind\nwithin the **Tiānmìng xìng** (Heavenly Fate nature).\nNever covet swift, superficial results—\nonly seek **cānmén** (heart-mind realization).\nWith resolve, guide this mind of yours\nsteadfastly along the Dao/Way,\nand even **tóngqiáng tiěbì** (copper walls and iron barriers)\nwill be shattered.\n\nThen, naturally, there will come a day of liberation—\nwhen the fruit ripens and the core falls,\nthe mind suddenly awakens,\npenetrating heaven and earth.\n\nIf one’s blessings are thin and fate shallow,\nthey must accumulate **dé** (virtue/power)\nand persevere in practice,\nadvancing with courage and precision.\n\nPerhaps they fail to awaken in this lifetime,\nbut in the next—\nor the next—\nuntil even across **qiānshēng wànshǎi** (ten thousand lifetimes),\nthey cannot escape the moment of awakening.\n\nSet this resolve:\nthe heart of enlightenment will never retreat,\nand they will surely become great **bēihuà** (compassionate vows) scholars,\nultimately attaining the Dao/Way.\n\nYet **hóngfú** (profound blessings) are easy to cultivate,\nwhile **qīngfú** (pure blessings) are hard.\n\nIf you have the resolve to walk the **outworldly Dao/Way** (out-of-this-world Dao),\nthis is the **zhèngdào** (true/orthodox Dao),\nnot the **wàidào** (external Dao) of worldly scheming,\nnor the pursuit of endless life through alchemical arts—\nthat is but a **kànshān shǒushī** (mountain-guardian, corpse-watching) specter,\nenduring for ten thousand generations.\n\nThis **Wújí Qīngjìng Zhèngdào** (Boundless Dao of Pure Stillness)\ndemands no hasty results,\nno immediate gains—\nnot even in three years or nine years.\nIts essence lies solely in **jiànxìng** (seeing one’s true nature).\n\nEffects manifest daily,\nchanging hourly—\nsaliva sweetens the tongue,\nhands and feet grow firm,\nthe head sprouts a **yuánxiàng** (round symbol),\nthe mind opens the **Tiānmén** (Heavenly Gate),\ninternal fire steams the belly,\nthe whole body resonates with **húnshēn gǔxiǎng** (primal **qi** vibrations),\nyet these are but **zhōngxià xiūgōng** (mid-to-lower cultivation attainments).\nThey must be methodically refined\nto return to the Dao’s essence.\n\nFor the Dao is utterly void,\nits substance utterly nonexistent—\nthus it is called **Boundless**.\nIf practice fails to return to its source,\nand one mistakes fleeting gains for true attainment,\nthey fall into **pángmén wàidào** (side paths and external Dao),\nand thus stray by a hair’s breadth\nto err by ten thousand miles.\n\nAs for those who cling to names and fixed forms,\nwho guard their **ānshì** (alchemical cauldrons) jealously,\nwho establish their **lìdǐng** (furnaces) rigidly—\nthose who at **zǐshí** (the hour of the Rat) ascend lead,\nand at **wǔshí** (the hour of the Horse) descend mercury,\nwho advance **yánghuǒ** (yang fire) and retreat **yīnsí** (yin symbols),\nwho follow the **guà** (trigrams) to perform their work,\nand depend on timing for their effects—\nif they fail to recognize the **fǎnhuán dàotǐ** (return to the Dao’s essence),\nthese are all **xiàchéng xiǎodào** (lower-grade petty Dao).\n\nBut the **Qīngjìng Wúwéi** (Pure Stillness, Non-Action) Dao\nis the **miàodào** (wondrous Dao) of natural return,\nwhich differs greatly from the above.\n\nTake, for instance, the **imperial scriptures**—\nwhen one sincerely takes the vow,\nsets the resolve,\nand pledges to transcend the mundane,\nthis very **initial heart** is like the **Yùnǚ Fàngxiāng** (Jade Maiden emitting fragrance).\n\nOnce the **heart-fragrance** is released,\nthe **six paths** of rebirth are reversed,\nand all who hear this fragrance\nuniversally attain liberation.\n\nThis **emission of fragrance** is the practice,\nand this **hearing of fragrance** is the effect.\n\nOr as when the **Yùdì** (Jade Emperor) emits light,\nilluminating all **zhūtiān zhūdì** (heavenly and earthly realms),\nthe **Boundless world**,\nall encompassed within the radiance—\nlike a **limitless mirror**,\nmutually containing each other—\nthis is the effect.\n\nOr as when **duànzài** (severing obstacles) is the practice,\nthe **shíqī guāng** (ten kinds of light) and **sānshí zhǒng gōngdé** (thirty kinds of virtue/power)\nare the effects.\n\nThe **virtue/power** and **reward/retribution** teachings\nare the effects of **dòujīng rén** (those who recite scriptures).\n\nFor example, those who were once **light-headed, frivolous, and rash**,\nwhose mouths never cease—\nonly **húyán** (empty babble),\nwhose hands never stop—\nonly **duōmáng** (endless busyness).」\n\n「Feet never stop, only blindly wandering;\nSitting never ceases, only crooked and askew;\nSleep never rests, the body tosses and turns;\nTwo eyes ever wide—\nglancing east, then west,\ncoming and going like the wind,\nnot the conduct of one cultivating the Dao.\n\nLike a cow without a nose ring,\nor a horse without a bridle,\nnot following the straight path but wandering.\n\nNow, having taken precepts,\nwearing the **changdàyī** (long robe),\nfastening the sash,\ncarrying the alms bowl and wearing shoes,\nwe assume the outward form of a true practitioner.\nFollowing others in their practices,\nlistening to words and observing forms,\nwe abandon our former crude, hasty ways\nand strive to become composed and observant—\nthis is the practice of upholding precepts.\n\nTransforming our **qi** and nature,\nchanging into the **Dao/Way’s** bearing,\nso that others, upon seeing us, naturally feel reverence—\nthis is the outward manifestation of upholding precepts.\n\nIf one can uphold **miàoxíng** (wondrous conduct),\nwith focused thought and mind aligned with the Dao,\nseeking only to awaken the clear mind and see true nature,\nnot desiring effects,\nfearing only that the practice is insufficient,\nnot that effects will not come—\nthen naturally, when the great ripeness arrives,\none will awaken fully to the end.\n\nIf one’s practice is not strict,\nwith thoughts and minds ever shifting,\nintermittently doubting and confused,\nthe mind not true, the spirit not responsive,\nthe thoughts not pure, the **qi** not gathered,\nthe spirit drifting, the **qi** floating,\nthe mind’s resolve not sharp—\nhow then can effects arise?\n\nYou today,\nwith great resolve,\nwishing to escape the **lúnhuí** (wheel of rebirth),\nmust first expand your measure,\ntighten your practice,\nand postpone seeking effects—\nthen it will be wondrous.\n\nFor instance, a skilled physician prescribes medicine,\nseeking balance within.\nA mediocre physician prescribes medicine,\ndemanding swift effects,\nignoring the root,\nonly hoping to see quick results—\nyet once the near-term effects appear,\nthe fundamental **yuánqì** (original life-energy) is ultimately harmed,\nand its vitality may never fully recover.\nOften, new symptoms arise,\nand the patient, unaware,\nregrets too late.\n\nGreat assembly,\nif you daily and nightly\nfollow the precepts strictly,\nadhere to the teachings,\nconstantly remind and diligently

spirit, unerring—\nthough the body be mortal, the Dao is complete.\n\nCompleting the Dao is neither easy nor difficult—\nprecepts held or abandoned rest within the heart.\n\nLife and death, death and life arise from precepts and stillness;\nonce returned, do not neglect them as if they were stubborn.\n\nFifteen years to preserve life and prolong existence—\nO disciples, I spoke to you before, urging you to awaken fiercely,\nto take great vows, seeking only to illuminate life and death.\nDo not diminish your resolve—\ndo not follow the way of the two vehicles, clinging to life and fearing death.\n\nNow you speak of methods to preserve life and extend existence—\nis this not double-tongued deception, misleading the assembly?\n\nO disciples, the method of preserving life and prolonging existence that I speak of\nis not clinging to the form, nor merely preserving vital essence,\nnor extending this transient mortal span.\n\nWhat I call preserving life is the *tianming*—the nature of Heaven’s decree,\nthe preservation of Heaven’s bestowed mandate, awaiting it in ease.\n\nThis *tianming*—the nature of Heaven’s decree—\nis the *rujia*’s wisdom-life, the Daoist’s original star of fate.\n\nThis *ming*—this is the longevity of death yet not perishing.\n\nAgain, as the *Jin Gang Yun* says:\n*\"How to attain long life? The unbreakable body of the Golden Adamantine.\"*\n\nAgain, Heaven’s decree is unchanging—\ncultivate the body and mind, awaiting it.\n\nAgain, exhausting principle and nature to reach *ming*—\nthis is the essential logic of establishing fate.\n\nWhat is spoken of as prolonging is not dispelling illness to extend years,\nnor achieving immortality and deathlessness.\n\nIt is the unshaken true nature, imperishable through all kalpas,\nthe eternal *dharma-body* that nurtures all beings,\nthe extraordinary form—\nnot the mere mortal shell.\n\nIf one cultivates the skin-bag, one may live longer,\nbut only dies later—\nthis is not the true Dao.\n\nWhat I now point to in preserving life\nis harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, encompassing all things.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth shift and change,\nmy true nature remains undisturbed.\nThough all things have their end,\nmy true nature knows no end.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth and all things cycle through kalpas and cosmic eras,\nmy serene, true, and constant essence—\npure, luminous, and unobscured—\nstands beyond all forms, unspoiled, unaltered, unchanging.\n\nThis is what is preserved in life, what is prolonged in existence—\nthe ever-flowing, ceaseless *tianli*, the true constant Dao.\n\nThis passage is spoken only out of necessity.\nThose with clear vision, who penetrate the silent teachings of the silent seat,\nwill know its meaning without a word.\n\nThe Great Dao is boundless,\nembracing Heaven and Earth,\nleaving no place unheld, no time unpresent, no thing unincluded—\neveryday actions, every moment, are the Dao.\n\nSeeing and hearing, moving and resting,\neating and drinking, advancing and retreating,\nwearing clothes, taking food,\ncold and heat—\nall are the Dao.\n\nYet you are ensnared by material *qi*, bound by habits,\nunaware in your daily life.\n\nThe void within shines clearly in response,\nyet before its influence, you stumble step by step in confusion.\n\nNow, relying on the founders of the Three Teachings,\nwith boundless compassion for salvation and the sorrowful wish to benefit all,\nI cannot help but speak at length to you.\n\nThus, I proclaim to all beings:\nthere is no other law—\nif there were two laws, it would not be the true path of the Great Vehicle.\n\nYour spark of insight—\nthis is another name for *huiming*—\noriginally one essence.\n\nThis *huiming* is but a provisional name for the Dao-body,\nspringing from the same source.\n\nThough it arises differently,\nit encompasses the Three Teachings while remaining one.\n\nThis *huiming* appears at every moment—\nyou do not see its form;\nit hides at every instant—\nyou do not know its whereabouts;\nit speaks the law daily—\nyou do not hear its voice.\n\n「Are you not like the foolish ones who seek fire by the lamp and ride the ox to find the ox? My children, why do you cling to other teachings?\n\nI fear you do not recognize this *huiming*—it is the **Soul-Treasure** (*lingbao*). Deeply knowing you, at every turn you resist it—you are not those who have seen their true nature (*jianxing*) or grasped the intent (*zhi yi*) of the Dao.\n\nEven if you see it, you do not use it.\nWhen you do use it, you cannot wield it fully.\nWhen this spark of *huiming* departs,\nit is as if **Yuan Shi Tian Zun** leaves his seat of law,\n**Huangdi** loses his **Mysterious Pearl** (*xuanzhu*),\n**Tie Lao** abandons his staff,\nand **Zhang Guo** discards his **Green Donkey** (*qinglü*).\nUnable to speak, yet groping at empty nostrils;\nhaving a heart yet no aperture—\nhow could you be so dull and murky?\nNow, with this **Sacred Heart** of the *Taoist* scriptures,\nI uphold the **Great Virtue** of the **Ancestral Sage** (*qiu zu*) in cherishing life,\nurging you to awaken and seek\nthe wondrous principle of preserving life and extending existence.\n\nHave you not heard the *Sutra of the Supreme Dao of Mysterious and Numinous Treasures for Dispelling Calamities and Protecting Life*?\n\nIf you can truly comprehend this sutra,\nyou will be able to perpetuate your *huiming* endlessly—\neverlasting, never ceasing.\n\nIf you merely chant the name aloud,\nthat is but **offering**—not true comprehension.\nThose who merely offer,\nchant as they may, will depart as they began—\nthey cannot savor its depth.\n\nThe sutra does not say:\n*\"You beings, from beginningless time,\nyour mind is enslaved by form,\nyour thoughts follow the shifting of objects.\nOnly when lost in love and infatuation,\ndo you tirelessly drift in the river of desire,\ndrown in the ocean of craving,\ncling to illusory shapes and images,\nand lose sight of your original nature.\n\nThe Dao is formless—yet you grasp it as form;\nThe Dao is not empty—yet you cling to it as emptiness.\nConfused by the duality of emptiness and form,\nyou invert existence and nonexistence,\nand ultimately cannot clarify your own self.\nHow could you escape the path of birth and death,\nor leap beyond the cycle of transmigration?\n\nIf one knows emptiness is not empty,\nknows form is not form,\ndoes not cling to the perception of emptiness,\nand transcends all doubts and defilements,\nthen they can purify the Six Senses,\nand sever all obstacles.\n\nThis is the **core principle** of our school,\nwhich I now proclaim to you—\nthe sutra is named:\n*Protecting Life to Attain the Dao*,\n*Universal Salvation of Beings*,\n*Teaching the World*,\n*Circulating for Recitation*.\nThose who recite and transmit it\nwill be guarded by **Flying Heavenly Kings**,\n**Vajra-Destroyers of Demons**,\n**Numinous Treasure Children** who protect the law,\n**True Persons** who rescue suffering,\nand **Golden-Eyed Ferocious Beasts**—\neach with ten million hosts to shield this sutra,\nso that all beings may escape these defilements.\"*\n\n**Assemblage!** (*Dazhong ya!*)\nThe **form-body** (*se shen*) could never know emptiness is not empty,\nknow form is not form,\ndiscern the **formless law** (*wu kong fa*),\nor **penetrate** (*dòng guān*) the **unobstructed** (*wu ài*).\nHow could it enter the **gates of myriad wonders**?\n\nThus, I first clarify the sutra’s profound truths\nto safeguard your *huiming*—your vital spark.\n\nThe **Ancestral Sage’s** compassion fears\nyou mistake the **form-body** for your true self.\nHe urges you to be:\n**without trace in the without** (*wu zhong wu*),\n**form within form** (*se zhong se*),\n**having within the having** (*you zhong you*),\n**emptiness within emptiness** (*kong zhong kong*),\nso that this illusory flesh does not summon or manipulate you—\nso that you are not lost in its endless clamor,\nbewildered by the true **school** (*zong*), and forfeit the **Soul-Treasure**.\n\nThus, this sutra commands you\nto protect your **numinous root** (*ling gen*),\nand **nurture your primal essence** (*zhuang yuan ben*).\nWhen the root is steadfast, the Dao arises.\n\nThe **virtuous person** delights in Heaven—\nthus, they preserve life.\n**Longevity and vitality** (*qian shou*) are inseparable—\nthis is **extending existence** (*yan sheng*).\n\nThe **virtuous person** serves Heaven—\nthus, their *huiming* endures.\nHence, you are everlasting and unceasing,\nyour transformations flow freely,\nand you attain the **unbreakable Vajra-body** (*jin gang bu huai zhi ti*),\nfulfilling the **imperishable Dharma-body** (*zhen chang wu lou zhi fa shen*).\n\n**Assemblage!**\nThe **Three Caverns** and **Four Palaces** of scriptural records,\n**five thousand three hundred** (*wu qian san bai*) **true texts**—\nonly those that extend existence and preserve life\ncan transcend the **kalpas** and rise above the dust.\n\nClinging to form is not preserving life—\ntrue emptiness is extending existence.\n\nThe *huiming* essence does not depart from *huiming*—\nthe *huiming* light is the *huiming* lamp.\nIf you wish the light to shine eternally,\nyour *huiming* must be steadfastly preserved.\n\nPreserved, it does not stray from **serene stillness** (*jing ding*)—\nthe lamp’s glow naturally attains **constant clarity** (*chang ming*).\n\nEnlightened to the **True Suchness Lamp** (*zhen ru deng*), it shines perpetually,\nilluminating the **good path** for all beings.\n\nIts **true substance** is without light to be seen—\nits **true clarity** cannot be named.\nIt is but the **original essence** within life,\nand when *huiming* opens, the illusory speech of light and darkness arises.\n\nIn this **world of form and emptiness** (*se kong shi jian*), life and death persist—\nyet **emptiness within form** (*kong se*) preserves life and extends existence.\n\nExtending existence is transcending the kalpas—\ntranscending the kalpas, what death or name could there be?\n\nAll beings, only because they are lost in *huiming*,\ndrift through kalpas, birth after birth.\n\nThe **Lamp of *Huiming*** and its **light** shine universally—\nyou must swiftly awaken to the **cause of discipline** (*jie yin*).\n\nNow, test your grasp of this wondrous method:\n**stillness within emptiness**—I point to you all.\n\n**My children!** My children!\nThe sutra says:\n*\"When it cannot be seen yet is used, life is preserved;\nWhen it is seen yet cannot be used, existence is extended.\nOnly extinguish the **active mind** (*dong xin*), not the **illuminating mind** (*zhao xin*), then existence is extended.\nBut extinguish the **dwelling mind** (*zhu xin*), and must solidify the **empty mind** (*ning kong xin*), then life is preserved.\nTo extend existence is to ensure the *huiming* does not cease—\nthus, the **Great Medicine** is complete.\nTo preserve life is to attain the **fruit of non-birth** (*wu sheng ke zheng*)—\nthus, the **Great Elixir** is fulfilled.*\n\n*\"Only through the Dao does life endure—\nif aligned, it is obtained;\nif misaligned, it is lost.\"*\n\n*\"Received from Heaven, reflecting Heaven’s luminous life,\neven Zhou—though ancient—renews its mandate;\nits essence is ever new.\"*\n\nAll are the **true principles** of preservation and extension—\nthis is called the **Great Dao of Establishing Life** (*li ming zhi da dao*).\n\nMy children, if you comprehend thus,\nyou have fully attained this wonder.\nNow, I will not spare even my most precious treasures,\nemptying my **bag of elixirs** (*qing nang dao*), revealing the **deepest mysteries** (*zhi xie xuan ji*).\n\nHere is a **gatha** of four lines—\nponder it carefully, all beings:\n*\"Life’s brevity and longevity stem from its original essence,\nbirth and death are but illusions from the start.\nNo need to seek any method for preservation and extension—\nthe method is **non-method** within the **Dharma-King’s City** (*wu fa fa wang cheng*).*\"»\n\n**The Azure Courtyard Platform Sutra, Lower Volume: The Sixteenth Explication of the Grand Dao** (*Bìyuàn Tán Jīng Xià Juàn Shíliù Fāntán Hóngdào*)\n\nMy disciples, though the Dao I spoke of yesterday—though its essence is *wuwei* and its body the Dharma-body—know this: the Dao-body is never separate from the constant body, and the Dharma-body dwells within the physical form itself.\n\nThe physical form, when firm, is adorned by the *meritorious deeds of the external*—the realm of *youwei*; the Dharma-body, when serene, is adorned by the *meritorious deeds of the internal*—the realm of *wuwei*. When both inner and outer are pure, and both are realized, then the spirit is liberated, the supreme unbroken true void shines forth—great radiance, perfect fulfillment, invincible, with all spirits paying homage, commanding thunder and lightning, guarding the Three Realms, and the Five Emperors welcoming it. This is not achieved through the cultivation of *youwei* merits.\n\nDisciples, if you refine and nourish the *qi*, the *qi* will settle and the essence will condense. If you still the fire and return the wind, the essence will transform into *qi*, permeating the Four Great Elements and harmonizing with all spirits. True fire without smoke makes the *qi* clear; spirit-water without leakage makes the spirit tranquil. Clear *qi* refines the spirit; tranquil spirit merges with emptiness. When emptiness is absolute and stillness profound, the original essence returns, and the Nine Returns and Seven Regressions occur, restoring the command to its root. Returning to the root establishes the command and preserves true nature. True nature preserved, the Dao-body manifests; the Dao-body manifest, the Dharma-body appears.\n\nDisciples, this is the Dao-body cultivated within *youwei* as *wuwei*, the Dharma-body cultivated within *wu* as *you*. The physical form has a lifespan; the Dharma-body has wisdom-life. Lifespan is granted by Heaven, not by oneself, so the physical form undergoes rebirth and death, cycling through kalpas. Wisdom-life is attained by oneself, not by Heaven, so the Dharma-body’s power is unbound, its liberation unobstructed.\n\nDisciples, the physical form’s lifespan is limited—fate cannot be escaped. Heaven decrees death, and death must come. The Dharma-body’s wisdom-life is boundless, its powers vast, eternally realizing the unborn. Only then does true longevity arise.\n\nDisciples, even if the physical form lingers for ten thousand years, it is but a demon—no Dao. The Dharma-body, ever present, is the sage’s true saying: *\"Morning hear the Dao, evening die—sufficient.\"* The Dharma-body dies yet does not perish; thus it is called eternal life. The physical body dies and dies again—thus it is impermanent.\n\nDisciples, if you realize the Dharma-body, even those with short, impermanent lives may attain longevity. If you cling to the physical form’s appearance, even those with boundless longevity may fall into rebirth.\n\nIn one word: pierce through the physical form, and all concerns dissolve. Cultivate with true sincerity, untainted by dust. Do not let the Dharma-body be bound by the physical form—only pierce the physical form to liberate the Dharma-body. Is this not the **Great Transformation**, the flourishing of the Dao’s momentum?\n\nNow, what I expound is the **Perpetual Transformation** of filial piety and the Dao. To restore the ancestral Dao’s brilliance, who else will protect the Dharma-body if it is not made clear? As it is said: *\"If the teaching is not expounded, the Dao remains obscure; if the Dao is obscure, the Dharma cannot be practiced; if the Dharma is not practiced, the Dao cannot be expounded.\"* The sage has said: *\"It is the person who expounds the Dao, not the Dao that expounds the person.\"* Only if you recognize those who expound the Dao, practice the Dharma of the Dao, and speak of its profound essence—how could the Dao’s lineage decline, or the ancestral wind fade?\n\nIn my youth, I was unlearned, my studies sparse. I did not master Confucian or Buddhist teachings but stubbornly sought Daoist learning, wandering the lands for decades, intent on tracing its source. What I sought was my own innate awareness; what I questioned was my original wisdom-nature. Through prolonged inner cultivation, my innate awareness revealed itself on the Cinnabar Platform; through deep inquiry, my wisdom-nature emerged in the Void Chamber. With an inner master, how could I not welcome guests and respond to visitors? With the true lineage within, I sought to expound the teaching and uphold the Dao.\n\nDisciples, I am unskilled in letters, ashamed before the Three Caverns’ treasures. Though I read some alchemical texts, I lacked access to the true elixir secrets. My nature being lazy, preferring leisure and stillness, I often cultivated wisdom-life, delving into the mysteries of the Immortal, abandoning all else to embrace the true essence. Where was the time to read Confucian texts or alchemical scriptures? Thus, to this day, I remain unlettered, my speech clumsy and blunt, yet I speak plainly of these supreme truths and hidden mysteries, revealing what has not yet been disclosed.\n\nYet the Dao is beyond words—why speak? The scriptures require no study—why open halls? The teaching is *wuwei*—why trouble oneself? This Dao belongs to all; never can it be absent for an instant. Whether in the world or the Dao, one may awaken to it, may seek it—why must one renounce the world and become a recluse, seeking teachers and friends? Only because of this matter of birth and death, unresolved in the heart, do people hunger for sustenance, roam the world, and search the ends of the earth for a way to return to the root and restore the command.\n\nFortunately, there are the Jade Purity, Upper Purity, and Supreme Purity, who transmitted scriptures, expounded the Dao, established teachings, and opened halls, propagating and transmitting the lineage to this day. Among them, Confucius’ disciples—Zhou Dunyi, the Two Chengs, Zhang Zai, and Zhu Xi—received the secrets of the sacred texts and elucidated the essence of the heart-method. Then there are the *Vajra Sutra*, the *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment*, and the *Heart Sutra*—the true doctrines of Buddhism, the profound mysteries of stilling the body and transcending desire. What the Three Teachings share is the single path of nature and life: all are methods of compassion, delivering beings from suffering and saving life.\n\nNow, I—though unworthy—am counted among the descendants of the Qiu lineage, following tradition to propagate the Dharma-treasures, receiving and transmitting the teaching as I have been taught.\n\nThe disciples, I am but an ordinary mortal, lacking divine powers, knowing only the plain daily practices to awaken others. I am merely one who upholds conduct and observes precepts within the Daoist path. Unlike those who sell spells for alms, idle their hands, eat without merit, and clothe themselves without virtue—how could they truly understand birth and death?\n\nThus, I only rouse my own spirit to fulfill the universal salvation. Above, I uphold the sacred teachings; below, I benefit all beings. It is all for the sake of others, not for myself.\n\nOur Dragon Gate lineage began with the Qiu ancestor of the Yuan Dynasty, who revived the mysteries and illuminated the transformations. For four hundred years since then, few have been the exalted ones, and rare the devoted souls. Now, in the twilight of the Dao, I have spent thirty years in heartfelt observance of precepts, adhering to the laws and following the rules. Through seeking truth, fate favored my will—at Rongwu, I encountered my teacher; in the Nine Palaces, I received the law. Over twenty years have passed.\n\nHeaven opened the Dao’s fortune, and I joyfully met the imperial era, encountering a flourishing age where officials and merchants take delight in goodness and benevolence. Fellow seekers of the Way had the right timing, and those inclined to cultivation found the moment. Thus, I opened halls and established precepts in the capital. Through eight seasons of teaching, the wind stirred a thousand truths. Both the refined and the common had the karmic connection, all taking refuge in precept and stillness, directly entering the wondrous Dao of purity and emptiness.\n\nI, the humble one, rely solely on this spark of insight, sincere and silent, moved by Heaven’s grace to attain true encounters. Presumptuously ascending the law-seat, I falsely claim the title of Preceptor. As for expounding the mysteries of the Dao and universally establishing sacred grounds, that is my deepest wish.\n\nDisciples, do not heed those who doubt and slander, clinging to their cushions, biting their teeth in silence, feigning the Dao’s form. In the end, they deceive only themselves. If such men speak of constant response and constant stillness—response to what? They cannot even preserve their own lives, how could they care for others’?\n\nListen well: *\"The precepts and scriptures come from the Dao Canon; transmitting the law by ritual is no falsehood. Only by expounding the teaching and saving all beings can I urge the lost to cease their blasphemy. Encourage all to broaden their tolerance, endure insults, and cultivate the true form of the teaching. With wisdom and insight both refined, virtue deepens, and all beings are delivered from suffering’s ocean. Those who receive precepts first sever their obstacles—when obstacles fall, light shines bright. Why fear dimmed wisdom? Only fear the radiance of ten thousand suns. Conceal the flame to preserve life, for wisdom endures. Do not cling to prolong life in illusion’s grasp. Embrace purity, nurture simplicity, and learn non-action. Wisdom and life extend, merging into vastness. If you cling to the colored body, you know not true longevity. Refusing to save others, you seek only self-liberation—how then could the Immortals save us? Ready-made robes, effortless meals—who provides them? How can rice from the Millet Ancestor or mountains of flour be consumed? A drop of water becomes the ocean’s roar, and the hell of Avīci’s cries. Deceiving others with offerings for ease, warm clothes and full bellies bring no thirst. With clever words and hollow speech, the Dao is already lost—promising ascension to lead you away. Those outside protect the name, offering more eagerly, like fools grasping at gold from water. How many mortals can awaken on their own? Who knows the year or month of their ascension? The enlightened know no jealousy; stillness comes first, self-liberation follows. In action, the Dao is expounded to save others—ten thousand words, one awakening. One awakening leads to universal salvation; salvation’s heart is firm and steadfast. The Dao flourishes, the teaching spreads, ancestral winds rise—liberation and true emptiness unite in heart-nature.\"*\n\n**Seventeen Methods of Saving Lives**\n\nDisciples, what I expound of the teaching and the Dao is not for myself, nor for the teaching itself—only to embody the Dao, follow Heaven’s law, and save all beings. In ancient times, the sages of the Three Teachings—if they had not acted for all beings, how could they have established teachings, transmitted scriptures, opened halls, and revealed truth through every means, exhausting their compassion?\n\nDisciples, the Confucian path has its most exalted teacher. His virtue harmonizes with the Supreme Ultimate; his Dao gathers the Great Achievement. He is neither rigid nor absolute, neither self-centered nor indifferent to others. He edited the Classics, established music, praised the *Yijing*, and upheld rites. In all things, he carried out the transformations of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*; in every direction, he elucidated the scriptures of filial piety and righteousness. The Dao was passed to Zengzi and Mengzi, bearing a heavy burden for the ages. He became the eternal teacher of scholars and the guiding sage of the people. Had it not been for Zengzi and Mengzi receiving the transmission in the Zhou Dynasty, and the Chengs and Zhu elaborating on it in the Song, how could there be the present day?\n\nThe Buddhist path originated with the Western Sage, Shakyamuni Buddha. He practiced austerities on the snow mountain, abandoned his kingdom and family, subdued his body and mind, and fulfilled his merits and practices. The Five Aggregates are empty, the Six Senses are pure. He manifested all wondrous forms, transforming himself in the ten directions. When Emperor Ming of Han dreamed of the golden man, the white horse came from the West, bringing the *Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom in Forty-Two Sections*—the Golden Prajnaparamita. The teaching spread among the Eastern people, and the title \"Tathagata\" was honored. The law was transmitted to the Sixth Patriarch, and the revered golden halls of the Brahmins were upheld. The Great Vehicle’s compassionate sovereign—if not for our Buddha’s transmission, how could the golden statues of the Arhat be venerated today?\n\nThe Dao is established by the Three Pure Ones, boundless and ineffable, towering and unfathomable. Its scriptures are profound and secret, passed down by sages. Manifesting in person to teach, it endures through kalpas, guiding beings from the sea of suffering and saving the world across the ages. It is the Three Officials transmitting the law, the Five Peaks opening halls. Pure Yang Lu Zu, the Master of the Three Teachings, issued the Five Thunder Orders, appearing in all directions, revealing the mysteries externally. With great compassion and great filial piety, great benevolence and great孝, he forgot fame and left behind incense and offerings. He transmitted to our Qiu ancestor, who diligently upheld the Dao and preserved benevolence, presenting the Red Book at the Phoenix Gate. He established the sect, transmitted precepts, and revived the pure laws at Dragon Gate. Through countless hardships, he vowed to save beings, earning the titles of the Venerable Long Spring True Lord and the Repeatedly Venerated Heaven-Responding Sage.\n\nHe illuminates all dharmadhatus, and all benefit from his boundless grace.\n\n「Practicing virtue and establishing *virtue/power* (德), manifesting all manner of divine powers (神通), is solely for the sake of delivering all beings (濟度眾生) and enabling them to attain the Dao/Way (同臻大道).\n\nAll disciples, those who seek to deliver others must do so with utmost sincerity and earnestness (苦苦切切), first delivering themselves (先度自己), and then others (然後度人). Now, if the transmission of the sect (教相) does not proceed, and the *Dao/Way* (玄隐) of the Quanzhen lineage (宗門) remains obscured, it is precisely because the fundamental affliction (大病) has not been eradicated here.\n\nWhy does the Dao/Way not manifest (大道不行), and why is the sect’s tradition so meager (教門哀薄)? All disciples, it is because the core principle of Quanzhen—*\"unable to deliver oneself, only to deliver others\"* (不能度已，只要度人)—these eight characters bear the great root of sin (大罪根), which inherently undermines the Quanzhen sect’s authentic transmission (公案).\n\nAll disciples, you who preach the sect: if you cannot even follow its teachings yourself (自己不能依教奉行), yet insist on urging others to do so (先要勸人依教奉行), who will believe you? How can Quanzhen be said to fail in self-delivery (全真不能度已)? All disciples, hear me!\n\nTo deliver all beings (度眾生) is to deliver the beings within oneself (度自己之眾生). What are these beings within oneself? All disciples, they are the delusive thoughts and illusory fantasies (雜念妄想) that arise from one’s own original mind (自己本心中之眾生). Within the Quanzhen practitioner’s abdomen (腹內), there are eighty-four thousand illusory fantasies and delusive thoughts (妄想雜念), meaning eighty-four thousand beings (即是有八萬四千眾生).\n\nWithin a single day, across the twelve *double-hours* (二六時中), even while seated on the meditation cushion (身座蒲團), one’s mind wanders through the world (心遊世上). The moment one delusive thought is extinguished (妄心才灭), another arises (妄念又來). The seven emotions (七情) never cease, and the six desires (六欲) ensnare one; the three poisons (三毒) drag one down, and the eight consciousnesses (八識) invert one’s perception.\n\nLike floating clouds obscuring the sun (如浮雲掩日), they drift east and west (東去西來); like raging waves driven by the wind (狂浪因風), they surge westward and dash eastward (西馳東蕩). Day and night, they never still (終朝日夜，何曾靜得一時); month after month, year after year, one fails to fix even a single thought (累月經年，未能定得一念). Not only while seated on the cushion (不但坐在蒲團), but even while walking the path (就走在道路), or in dreams (至于夢寐), how often does one cast aside delusive thoughts (那刻撇去妄心) and uphold a pure, right-minded intention (把持正念)?\n\nIf the mind does not rest (心不休), the body cannot be delivered (身不度); if thoughts are not singular (念不一), the Dao/Way remains unclear (道不明). Thus, within the Quanzhen lineage (全真門內), one must absolutely cease thoughts and rest the mind (必須要止念休心), only then can the true nature of the mind (天心) emerge (出現), and the luminous wisdom (慧光) reveal itself (發露).\n\nAll practitioners, if Quanzhen is practiced in this manner, then one may truly be called a *compatriot of the Dao* (同志). That is why it is said: first deliver oneself (先度已), then it is proper to go and deliver others (方好去度化眾人不遲).\n\nNow, how does one deliver oneself? Through **unyielding resolve** (剛烈), **courageous vigor** (勇猛), **diligence** (精進), **renunciation** (舍除), **almsgiving** (布施), **heightened clarity** (高明), **humility** (謙遜), **liberation** (解脫), and **spontaneity** (自然).\n\nAll disciples, you must focus your will (用志不分) and concentrate your spirit (凝神), purifying your thoughts (澄虑). Those with affinity for the Dao (同志有機緣的), listen attentively to me, and I will point out these nine essential principles (一一指那九件道要).\n\nAh, what is **unyielding resolve** (剛烈)? The teachings of the transcendent world (出世法) and those of the mundane world (世法) are inherently opposed (本來相反), differing in right and wrong (順逆不同), and conflicting in principles (方圆不合). The practice of the transcendent teachings (出世法) requires one to first regard the illusory appearances of the world (世間的幻相) and the delusive fantasies of the physical form (色身的幻想) as false (兩般先看假了). One must sever ties with children, spouse, and kin (子女妻孥), cutting off all entanglements of affection (恩情斩断); abandon fame and wealth (功名富有), rejecting the allure of sensory pleasures (味美裘馬), and free oneself from clinging attachments (留戀葛藤). With a singular, resolute heart (一心), one must leap beyond confusion and excrement (跳出迷屙), maintaining a pure and unfluctuating will (洁志不浮). This is called **unyielding resolve** (是曰剛烈). It is also known as the **staff of subduing demons** (降魔杵) and the **platform of slaying fiends** (斩妖台).\n\nWhat is **courageous vigor** (勇猛)? Hesitation and indecision (優柔不斷) allow the mind to wander (遊思或往來); when one loses hold of the method (把柄脫離), the light of clarity may be obscured (光明或開蔽). The mind should not be like autumn’s moon (心不同於秋月), ever luminous and clear (皎皎常明); the spirit should not ascend to morning mist (神不登於朝霞), radiant yet reversed (煌煌反照). Delay and laziness (迟延懈怠) make one drift with the waves and follow the currents (逐浪隨波); frivolity and indulgence (玩忽優悠) lead to perpetual vacillation (朝三暮四). One cannot achieve a sudden, sweeping clarity of the chest (胸襟一朝廓落) or an instant, unclouded brightness of vision (眼光立地澄清).\n\nTo exert effort on the mind (心上加功), one must cast aside all worldly concerns (全抛身世); in the Dao/Way, one must endure hardships (道中苦行) and crush the forces of illusion (摧卻邪魔). One must pierce through the iron walls and bronze ramparts of ignorance (鑽通鐵壁銅牆), awakening to the reality of heaven and hell (悟這是天堂地獄). All disciples, that is why after **unyielding resolve** (剛烈), one must also add **courageous vigor** (勇猛).\n\nWhat is **diligence** (精進)? This **unyielding resolve** (剛烈) is the severing of bonds of enmity and kinship (割斷恩仇), cultivating the mind and establishing one’s life (修心立命). This **courageous vigor** (勇猛) is the subjugation of scattered thoughts (降伏散亂), disciplining the wandering mind (整訪遊移), and stabilizing the luminous spirit (神明鎮定).\n\nBut what is the **greater diligence** (更精進者)? This is the scholar’s pursuit of the nature of birth and death (參求生死), before this very body has manifested (此身未有之前), asking: where were you? After this body perishes (此身死殁之後), where will you go? All things in the world—heaven, earth, and the ten thousand phenomena (世間天地萬物), daily and ordinary (日用平常)—are none other than the Dao/Way (無不是道). Whatever the eyes see (眼之所見), whatever the ears hear (耳之所聞), there is not a single thing outside the Dao/Way (無一物能出道外).\n\nThings have beginnings and endings (物有本末), which are their birth and death (即是物之生死); events have starts and finishes (事有始終), which are their birth and death (即是事之生死). If one uses the mind to investigate and reflect (用心參悟), with persevering will and meticulous pursuit (苦志精搜), one can clarify the origins and endings of things (能明物之本末), thereby understanding the birth and death of this body (則能明身之生死); one can clarify the conclusion and commencement of affairs (能明事之終始), thereby understanding the arising and cessation of the mind (則能明心之起滅了).\n\nBy examining all things and events (從事物上), subtly feeling and deeply comprehending (細細體貼，實實理會), one can penetrate the birth-and-death mechanism (生死之機) and the principle of arising and cessation (起滅之理) of even a single thing or event (自一物以至萬物，自一事以至萬事), without failing to grasp their nature. Then, the understanding of origins, birth-and-death, arising, and cessation all become a unified practice (都成一貫功夫), and only then can one approach the Dao/Way’s true nature (方能於道相近了).\n\nAfterward, one must focus the mind on the Dao/Way (冥心大道), pursuing it with the utmost refinement (微細追求), penetrating its hidden depths (洞明幽隱), and comprehending its profound mysteries (曉會玄機). In silent recognition (默識), one must align with the true nature of the mind (天心), and in secret communion (密通) with the sect’s essence (宗旨), one can awaken this singular point of subtle *qi* (這一點虚靈) to clarity (不昧), penetrating the source of its flow (進透源流). Thus, one responds to all things without confusion (應萬物而不迷), discerns all affairs without doubt (理萬事而不惑).\n\nIf one does not diligently pursue (不肯精進), but instead grows lax and negligent (自懈自怠), then one is abandoning oneself (自暴自棄), willingly becoming a lowly specter (甘為下鬼), lacking true aspiration for cultivation (無志真修). Even if one sits cross-legged for a hundred years (纵是趺坐百年), or extends one’s life for a thousand years (延生千載), ultimately, one will still fall into the impermanence of death (終歸無常), remaining trapped in the cycle of rebirth (仍落輪迴).\n\nWhat is **renunciation** (舍除)? It is the abandonment of former coarse and vulgar ways (舍去以前粗俗), and the eradication of all external, heterodox paths (除盡旁門外道). From this point onward, one must newly practice (新行), with absolute sincerity (一誠) directed toward the highest (向上). This singular point of subtle *qi* (這一點的虚靈) that does not stray from the true sect (不昧真宗) is the **primordial treasure of all beings** (元元至寶), ever-transforming and boundless (千變萬化), without fixed form (無有定體).」\n\n「When encountering things and events, the application of each is distinct, and the response to each is unique. At every turn, perception arises like a shadow; in every moment, confusion entangles the mind. Following the subtle and wondrous *灵机* (spontaneous wisdom), layer by layer, one penetrates and delves into the profound. Yet even so, the more one moves, the more one emerges—its resources are boundless, its application ceaseless. Those who awaken attain it themselves; those who remain ignorant are far removed.\n\nNow, I fear that if you can grasp even a fraction of this awakening, you will be able to uphold it and awaken further, never abandoning this awakening to seek another, for then you would have fallen into the *無常* (impermanence) of it. Instead, take this unchanging, constant *灵机* (spontaneous wisdom) and transform it to apply to the ever-changing, impermanent matters of the world. Then clarity of principle and manifestation of nature will shine forth; abandoning the old and embracing the new, you will pierce deeper layer by layer, ascending step by step toward the highest peak. Without reaching a state of lofty independence, how could one fathom profound wisdom, illuminate the mysteries of birth and death, and transcend the world beyond? How could one sever the doubts that bind across countless *劫* (kalpas)?\n\nWhat is **布施** (dāna/generosity)? Like yesterday’s awakened insight or the former subtleties of wisdom—whatever is attained and understood must be either shared with all beings or stored within the *黍米* (sūlima, the smallest grain of rice, symbolizing the minutest essence). It must not be hoarded, nor allowed to muddle the *灵台* (spiritual platform). The past is unattainable, the future is unattainable, and even this present moment is unattainable. Within this unattainability, if one further uncovers a self-attained marvel, then perfect wisdom will be illuminated.\n\nGenerosity with wealth is called cultivating merit. Generosity with the **法** (dharma/teaching) is called cultivating wisdom. Wealth can be exhausted through generosity, but my teachings—generosity with them—is boundless. Generosity with wealth can aid others in worldly matters, provide sustenance for the physical form, and adorn the outward appearance with splendor. Yet wealth can be depleted, leaving one empty-handed.\n\nMy generosity with the **法** (dharma/teaching) applies both to worldly and transcendent paths. Further, generosity with the **法** can awaken the confused, elevate the latent wisdom in all beings. However, generosity with wealth is not the mundane wealth of this world. Ordinary people may nurture life, save others, relieve emergencies, assist the helpless, ward off disasters, and bring prosperity to the nation—all manner of actions that fulfill the will of heaven, control the forces of yin and yang, and span the heavens and earth with boundless, limitless wonders. This wealth is the innate talent of beings, the very essence that manifests as the **善才童子** (Guanyin’s attendant, Shantizhu, the embodiment of skillful means) in the great bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara’s retinue.\n\nAh! You must know: to seek the treasures of heaven, one must use the wealth of the world. This worldly wealth is not the common wealth of the world; it is the **法财** (dharma-wealth) of self-liberation, called the **神宝** (divine treasure), and thus it can invoke the treasures of heaven. This daily practice is none other than generosity with the **法** (dharma/teaching). Those who attain this understanding are the foremost wise ones of countless *劫* (kalpas).\n\nWhat is **高明** (lofty brilliance)? To truly cultivate generosity with wondrous teachings and liberate all beings, one must perceive the true loftiness and attain perfect, unfathomable wisdom. All things in heaven and earth possess this luminous nature. If I treat the **法** (dharma/teaching) as fixed law, then I am clinging to the **法** (dharma/teaching). Clinging to the **法** (dharma/teaching) as law is dead **法** (dharma/teaching), not living **法** (dharma/teaching)—this is a lack of lofty perception.\n\nThus, if I apply my own rigid methods to teach others or impose fixed principles upon the world, it becomes a lifeless, mechanical **法** (dharma/teaching). This is like driving pegs into a post or shaking oars against the wind—it is the equivalent of binding oneself to a rigid column or striking a lute out of tune. One must instead hold to the boundless, upright brilliance, guiding at every moment, acting in accordance with circumstances, and flexibly expounding. If one applies round methods to square circumstances, they cannot adapt. If one teaches the foolish with wisdom, it does not suit their nature.\n\nOne must discern the foolish and speak to them in terms they can understand, making the truth clear and accessible. Adjusting to their capacity, they may gradually awaken. If one speaks to the wise as to the foolish, it is also not in accord with circumstances. The teachings must be such that both the wise and the humble can grasp them, blending seamlessly with life’s spontaneity—so that the wise see wisdom, and the compassionate see compassion. The stagnant can flow freely; the confused can be settled. The doubtful will be resolved, the dull will become insightful, the deaf will hear, and the blind will see—then one may truly be called **高明** (lofty brilliance), worthy to lead those in generosity and liberation.\n\nWhat is **谦逊** (humility)? When true cultivation reaches this stage, encountering those with clear vision—whose wisdom is vast and whose hearts are empty—all external matters, all worldly affairs, become utterly void. Above, they shake the celestial axis; below, they sway the earthly pivot. Beyond human realms, their spirit merges into boundless emptiness. They transcend the world, yet remain untouched by it.\n\n「Where is there still a sentient being before you? From ancient times to today, the two-vehicle *arhat*s (乘), lesser-vehicle *bodhisattva*s (菩萨), and lowly *xianzi* (仙子) have all suffered from this affliction. Deeply entrenched, they remain utterly unaware. Thus, they are called the **small vehicle’s inferior roots** (劣根), the **heterodox outer teachings** (旁门外教), and **perverse Dao/magic** (邪道魔法). If so, they fail to grasp the **boundless formless** (无定体), the **unfathomable transformation** (神化不测). How could you confine or seize what transcends all limits?\n\nBounded things—how could they presumptuously exalt themselves? Have you not heard that the **Highest Sage** (太上) does not dare to lead the world first? It does not claim precedence in blessings, nor does it boast of its own Way, nor does it flaunt its own virtue/power. It advances by retreating as its principle, and stands high by taking lowliness as its foundation. It sets aside its own body yet the body remains; it yields its own position yet the body takes precedence. While others vie to lead, it alone retreats behind. **Lofty virtue is not virtue** (上德不德), **superior worth has no strife** (上士无争). It is unseen yet seen, not proud, not self-exalted, not self-assertive. It gives to others and thus its own virtue/power is all the more abundant; it benefits others and thus its own virtue/power is all the more plentiful.\n\nI do not know its name—let me call it **Dao** (道). The higher one ascends to lofty brilliance, the more one practices the **humble and retiring virtue/power** (卑退之功夫). With humility and gentleness, one preserves the **thick Dao** (厚道). One way, it universally manifests **compassionate wisdom** (慈慧); another way, it safeguards and nurtures its **radiant essence** (光芒). A nation’s most potent tools should not be displayed to others—if I do not compel others to submit, they will naturally submit to me. At this stage, the **liberation’s profound principle** (解脱道理) cannot be overlooked.\n\nWhat is **liberation** (解脱)? All disciples who cling to attachments do not understand **Dao/virtue** (道德). Free and unencumbered, they are not entangled by the *dharma* (法); stark and unadorned, they are not burdened by material things. Perfectly round and harmonious, they adapt teachings to the situation; radiant and luminous, they guide sentient beings across countless eons. Entering the **Gate of Marvelous Perfection** (妙门), they become the **Mother of All Sentient Beings** (众生之母). Compassion can love all things, yet it does not take loving all things as its own compassion; goodness can aid others, yet it does not take aiding others as its own goodness. The **Marvelous Law** (妙法) can liberate all sentient beings, yet it does not take liberating sentient beings as its own Marvelous Law; the **Supreme Way** (至道) can transcend the world, yet it does not take transcending the world as its own Supreme Way.\n\nIt can both emerge from suffering and endure suffering. Above, it can transcend celestial palaces, yet does not regard the **Heavenly Abode** (天宫) as a place of joy; below, it can universally rescue the **Hell Realms** (地狱), yet does not take the Hell Realms as a source of torment. When encountering suffering, it liberates others from it; when encountering joy, it shares it with all. In joy, it can point out the suffering of sentient beings; in困境 (*困中*), it can illuminate the happiness of sentient beings. In heaven, it guides **celestial beings, dragons, ghosts, and spirits** (天龙鬼神), enabling them to hear the **True Awakening** (正觉) and attain **transcendent immortality** (仙功); on earth, it liberates **culpable, suffering souls** (罪业亡魂), allowing them to behold **radiant clarity** (光明) and be reborn into the **human realm** (人界); in the human world, it guides all **virtuous men and faithful women** (善男信女) to universally practice **daily mundane conduct** (日用寻常), **non-action and rectitude** (无为正直), **loyalty, sincerity, and fairness** (忠信公平), and the **Great Dao of the Virtuous** (贤良大道). It does not teach those of the **four occupations** (士农工商) to enter the **lower vehicle’s petty methods** (下乘小法), to manipulate **vital essence and spirit** (精魂), to fall into **demonic and malevolent destinies** (着魔恶趣), or to engage in **battles with *modu* (修罗)**.\n\nIn this liberation, one must attain **spontaneous efficacy** (自然之用), which is the **Way of Freedom** (自在之道). What is **spontaneity** (自然)? All disciples, this **spontaneous marvel** (自然之妙) is the **Heart Sutra’s** (心经) **Bodhisattva of Boundless Perception** (观自在菩萨), who is **the One Who Hears the World’s Sounds** (观世音), perceiving the sounds of the world. Those who grasp this **spontaneous marvel** become **the Boundless Perception Bodhisattva within themselves** (自我自在观音)—the **Observing Bodhisattva of the Southern Sea** (南海之观音). It is the **form of the pure other shore** (彼岸清静真空之妙相), the **principle of void and spontaneity** (虚无自然之理), able to perceive the **form of true sound** (真音之妙相). Without a true teacher’s guidance, how could one awaken to the **form of true void** (真空妙相)?\n\nAh, disciples! **Form is void, void is form** (色即是空空是色)—if not void, not form, the Dao is not true. The **true void’s marvelous form** (真空妙相) is the **constant Dao** (真常道); if neither void nor form, the marvel is boundless. It shares **one body with my void** (虚空), and **my void has no division with it** (没分己). It enters **metals and stones** (金石) yet causes no obstruction; it enters **water and fire** (水火) yet suffers no harm.\n\nDisciples, you must carefully ponder the **Nine Chapters of Dao’s Essentials** (九章道要), hold fast to the **Simple Core** (薄团), and awaken to all **marvelous forms** (妙相). Once you align with **spontaneity** (自然), the **three families** (三家) have already been verified—you will perfectly guide others, with boundless merit and virtue/power that even **ghosts and spirits submit to** (鬼神). Perverse *Dao* (邪魔) will be disarmed, and **demons will be dispirited** (妖精落魄). Why fear that the world will not believe and follow you?\n\nIt is the **universal liberation’s merit and practice** (普度功行), the **benevolent heart’s efficacy** (利济心), and the **diligent cultivation of one’s own liberation** (勤参度己后天人). With a sincere resolve toward the **constant Dao** (真常道), the **Boundless Perception Bodhisattva** (观音菩萨) will naturally protect your path. The **Nine Chapters’ Marvelous Precepts** (九章妙典) transcend the mundane world; the **one complete truth** (一片全真) is polished deeply. **Alms-giving’s subtle words** (布施微言) reveal the **true marvelous principle** (真妙理); **dual cultivation of nature and life** (双修性命) does not spare effort. **Insight is lofty and brilliant** (见识高明), offering many **teachings** (说法); **gentleness and humility** (仁柔卑逊) do not boast of ability. Abandoning external forms and forgetting self and others, one walks the **True Suchness of Heaven’s Great Dao** (真如天心大道). **Effortless liberation** (逍遥解脱) expounds the **supreme void’s profound Dao** (无上真空玄玄道). Even the **smallest fire** (小火) does no harm when the **three lineages** (三姓) are united—**merit is complete, practice is fulfilled**, and one ascends to the **clouds** (云霄).\n\nThe **Eighteenfold Wisdom** (十八智慧) shines brightly.\n\nDisciples, you have received the **Three Hundred Great Precepts of the Central Extremity** (中极三百大戒), practicing **secrecy** (密行) and **subtle conduct** (微细威仪)—this is not like the **initial true precepts** (初真戒) of your former days. These **precise and profound rules** (律条) must be applied diligently in your own heart. Whenever a thought or intention arises, you must **uphold sincerity and reverence** (存诚主敬), **examine and reflect inwardly** (暗自端详), **inspect and correct yourself** (省察提撕), and **maintain central rectitude** (大中正直). Sweep away the **pensive thoughts** (念头) in your heart, making it **spotlessly pure** (清清净净). Like the **verdant sky and radiant moon**, there is not a trace of clouds or shadows; like **crystal and polished glass**, there is not a speck of blemish; like **limitless bright mirrors**, there is not a particle of dust; like **night-pearls** (夜明珠), there is not a thread of darkness. Steady and round, **radiant and resplendent** (光灿灿), one may then **deliver the Dao** (讲道). **Wisdom and radiance** (智慧光明), **true void’s marvelous form** (真空妙相), all arise from **precepts and concentration** (戒定).\n\nThrough **enduring humiliation and severing obstacles**, with **precepts strict and refined**, through **self-discipline and rigorous cultivation**, aided by **dharma-pharmaceuticals**, one may attain this state. Yet if one **holds precepts loosely**, few can truly uphold them—**practicing secretly yet deceptively**, never truly ceasing even a fraction.\n\nWhy? **O foolish disciples**, if one’s **conduct is not secret**, it is called the **cause of defilement**—how then could one **realize the fruit of non-doing**?\n\nThese four words—**wisdom and radiance**—are the **highest rank of sharp faculties**. Thus, the **lowest rank of dull faculties** cannot penetrate them. Only by **unwavering resolve**, **concentrating qi at the acupoints**, **nurturing ancestral qi**, **nourishing primordial nature**, reaching **ultimate emptiness**, **steadfastly abiding in stillness**, **remaining pure and undivided**, **hiding the spirit in the boundless**, and **returning to the Great Polarity**, will **wisdom and radiance naturally arise**, as **one yang revives**—only then does one **see the original face**.\n\nTo **know the nature of spirits and gods**, to **grasp the mechanisms of transformation**—this is **wisdom**; to **participate in heaven and earth’s nurturing**, to **align with the sun and moon’s succession**, to **harmonize with the four seasons’ cycles**—this is **wisdom**; to **universally manifest the dharma-body**, to **subdue the dharma-realm within awareness**, never straying from **enlightenment’s illumination**, all returning to **the radiant void**—this is **radiance**; to **penetrate all things in formlessness**, to **foresee all matters before their signs**, to **pervade the void without trace**, to **transcend sun and moon without shadow**—this is **clarity**.\n\nIf one’s **precepts are not precise**, one cannot attain **serene composure**. Without **serene composure**, **wisdom does not arise**. Without **wisdom**, **radiance does not manifest**.\n\nThe *Jade Pivot Treasure Scripture* in one scroll **directly points to human nature**, **unveiling innate truth**, **laying bare celestial mechanisms**, enabling beings to **turn the scripture and awaken to the Way**. Yet alas, the **bewildered outnumber the enlightened**. They **recite with their mouths but cannot uphold with their hearts**; their **hearts may be sincere, yet their strength cannot transform**.\n\nWhat a pity—**they squander the sage’s intent**, **wasting the sacred treasure**. Now I must **interpret the scripture’s marvels**, **point to the true mechanism**, so that you may **suddenly awaken**.\n\nAll of you, **revere and listen with earnest intent**. The scripture says:\n\n*\"In the past, fifteen thousand kalpas ago, my heart encountered this Dao, and I attained the rank of Highest Truth. My intention cultivated this merit, and I thus governed the Great Transformation.\"*\n\nAgain it says:\n*\"With a serene mind, I vowed a boundless aspiration; with wisdom’s power, I subdued all demons.\"*\n\nAgain it says:\n*\"You heavenly and human beings who wish to hear the supreme Dao—\nThe supreme Dao is profound and distant, not found elsewhere.\nIf you truly wish to hear it, **‘without interruption’ is the key.\nWithout interruption, without perception—this is the true Dao.\nEven perception fades; only you remain.\nYou are not yet ‘having’—how much less the Dao?\nTo hear without hearing—what Dao is there to discuss?\"*\n\nAgain it says:\n*\"The Dao is entered with **sincerity**, guarded with **silence**, and applied with **gentleness**.\nTo use sincerity seems foolish,\nTo use silence seems inarticulate,\nTo use gentleness seems clumsy.\nThus, one may **forget form**, **forget self**, **forget forgetting**.\nThose who enter the Dao **know when to stop**,\nThose who guard the Dao **know caution**,\nThose who apply the Dao **know subtlety**.\nTo know subtlety, wisdom’s radiance arises;\nTo know caution, sacred wisdom is complete;\nTo know when to stop, serene composure is secure.\nSerene composure ensures sacred wisdom’s completeness,\nSacred wisdom’s completeness brings wisdom’s radiance,\nWisdom’s radiance unites with the Dao—\nThis is called **true forgetting**.\nForgetting yet not forgetting,\nNothing left to forget—\nThat which cannot be forgotten **is the supreme Dao**.\nThe Dao is in heaven and earth,\nYet heaven and earth do not know it;\nSentient and insentient alike—\nIt is **one and undivided**.\"*\n\nAgain it says:\n*\"Those who attain awakening **ascend to the celestial hall**.\"*\n\nAgain it says:\n*\"The foolish may become wise,\nThe turbid may become clear—\nAll by decree.\nFoolishness is dim and murky,\nTurbidity is dark and obscure—\nYet these are shaped by **inherited wind and soil**.\nHeaven’s divine mechanisms\nMake people unaware—\nThus it is called **natural**.\nIf one knows one’s unawareness,\nIt is also called **natural**.\nThe marvel of **naturalness**,\nThough wondrous in knowing,\nIts wonder lies in **unknowing**.\nYet in the Dao,\nThere was never **foolishness or turbidity**.\"*\n\nAgain it says:\n*\"All that I have proclaimed—\nThe worthy who receive the scripture\nMust **dig for gold and place coins**,\n**Swear to heaven** in its transmission.\"*\n\nThe disciples, this is the **true esoteric secret** of the *Jūshū Jīng*—the supreme, unfathomable treasure of serene liberation, the highest and most subtle of all. You merely recite the scriptures day and night, yet have never truly grasped their profound essence. If, while reciting and upholding them, you awaken to their hidden keys, then **sacred wisdom will be complete and luminous insight will arise**.\n\nThe **Ultimate Way** is profound and ineffable—neither visible nor audible. Had it not been for the **Celestial Worthy’s** opening of the serene mind and awakening of boundless aspiration **fifteen hundred kalpas** ago, seeking to deliver all beings and lead them to the peak of perfection—then declaring that the **source is emptiness**, with neither sound to hear nor form to see—if there is no sound to hear, then **forget the ears**; if there is no form to perceive, then **forget the eyes**. When ears and eyes are forgotten, then hearing and seeing will also vanish. Thus, ears and eyes, having form and color, are the leaders of the **six senses**; hearing and seeing, clinging to appearances and thoughts, are truly the **roots of the six senses**. How could they align with the **Dao**?\n\nIf one can purify the **six aspects** and sweep away the **six cognitions**, then the ears that do not listen **listen with the mind**, and the eyes that do not see **see with the spirit**. Thus, one does not listen yet hears, does not see yet sees. Without hearing or seeing, one is in accord with the **Dao**.\n\nThe *Chìwén Dònggǔ Jīng* says:\n*\"To forget the eyes, light overflows without limit;\nTo forget the ears, the mind’s depths remain ever still.\nBoth mechanisms forgotten, one enters the gate of all marvels.\nSeeing without seeing me, hearing without hearing—\nDetached from all boundaries, this is called the **Mystic Way**.\"*\n\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\n*\"Qi halts at the ears, the heart halts at the talisman.\"*\n\nThus, the *Jūshū Jīng* says:\n*\"To forget form and self is the mechanism of entering the **Dao**.\nAgain, with sincerity one enters—this ‘sincerity’ is **precept**.\nWith silence one guards—this ‘silence’ is **observing precepts to subdue body and mind**.\nTo use silence as if speechless is to enter **samādhi**, forgetting ears and eyes.\nTo act with gentleness as if clumsy is to conceal wisdom within the profound.\nAgain it says:\n‘You seek within your own colored form to hear or see—\nYet it will never be visible or audible.’*\n\nThe *Vajra Sūtra* says:\n*\"If one seeks me through form or sound,\nThat person walks the crooked path and cannot see the Tathāgata.\"*\n\nNow, those who seek the **Dao** must **receive precepts and enter samādhi**, secretly cultivating wisdom, confusing clarity with obscurity, yet not hearing while hearing, not seeing while seeing. Thus, those entering the **Dao** know **restraint**—this is the practice of **observing precepts and stilling thoughts**; know **caution**—this is the practice of **solitary vigilance and diligence**; know **subtlety**—this is the practice of **abandoning the sage and discarding wisdom**.\n\nTo still thoughts, one must **observe precepts**; to practice solitary vigilance, one must **enter samādhi**; to know subtlety, one must **cultivate wisdom**. If one truly **observes precepts, enters samādhi, and cultivates wisdom**, then body and mind will be perfectly tranquil, sacred wisdom complete, and luminous insight universally radiant. When the luminous insight penetrates, one merges with the **Dao**—this is called **true forgetting**. This **true forgetting** is not the **true forgetting** of sitting idle in empty meditation, but **true emptiness**. Within this **true emptiness**, there exists a **purple-golden wondrous form**—the marvel of **emptiness within non-emptiness**. If one does not fall into **coarse emptiness**, yet remains within **non-emptiness**, then the **subtle essence** naturally manifests. It is only because of **forgetting without forgetting what is forgotten** that one attains the **supreme and wondrous Way**.\n\nAgain it says:\n*\"Fools and sages differ—thus clarity and turbidity vary.\nThough shaped by unequal **inherited wind and soil**,\nAll are mechanisms of **creation’s workings**,\nDivine motion unfolding naturally,\nThe logic of **qi and fate**—already decreed by destiny.\nYet fools make themselves foolish, sages make themselves wise—\nHow could Heaven reward or punish their wisdom or folly?\nOnly by awakening a **serene mind** and establishing a **boundless aspiration**—\nTo depart the world and deliver others,\nOne must first hear the **Dao** and deliver oneself.\nThose who deliver themselves **take refuge in the Three Jewels**,\nReceive precepts, enter samādhi,\nCultivate wisdom to emit radiance—\nThen fools may become wise, and the turbid may become clear.\nIf one cannot **observe precepts, enter samādhi**, or penetrate wisdom,\nWithout radiance to illuminate,\nThen clarity may become turbid, and wisdom may become folly.\"*\n\nThe *Vajra Sūtra* says:\n*\"My teachings have no fixed form—\nThis is what is meant.\"*\n\nThe wisdom-light spoken of—**resplendent, vast, and profound**—illuminates the **dharma-realm**. How could it ever transcend the *Jūshū Bǎo Jīng*? **Jūshū** is the **true mechanism**. Those who wish to **turn the scripture** must first **turn the true mechanism**, secretly cultivating **merit and wisdom**. Yet I fear the **hidden light** cannot be opened or seen.\n\nHow could one **discern the forms of ghosts and spirits**, grasp the **pivot of creation**, participate in **Heaven and Earth’s transformation**, govern the **movement of sun and moon**, contain the **dharma-realm within a grain of millet**, and settle all things **before their origin**—to be called **Master of the Mystic Way**, advancing to the **Celestial Immortal’s realm**?\n\nIt is said:\n*\"Seeing the hidden light, one hears the **Dao’s root**.\nWithout cultivating **precepts and samādhi**, how could wisdom’s light be profound?\nClinging to appearances is not the true form—\nOnly by forgetting hearing can one truly hear.\nHearing, thinking, and cultivating enter the marvel—\nThe boundless ocean’s sound, free and at ease.\"*\n\n**The Nineteen Marvels of Divine Powers**\n\nDisciples, the wisdom-light of the **Dao** spoken of above—**the *Jūshū Jīng*** merely says that **hearing and seeing are extinguished**. Without hearing or seeing, the **marvels are already exhausted**, and **divine powers manifest**.\n\nThe *Yīnfú Jīng* says:\n*\"The deaf see, the blind hear.\"*\n\nAncient immortals say:\n*\"In stillness, no thunder is heard;\nIn deep gaze, no Mount Tài is seen.\"*\n\nThe *Zhōngyōng* says:\n*\"The virtue of ghosts and spirits—\nHow magnificent it is!\nTo see them, yet not see;\nTo hear them, yet not hear.\"*\n\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"See nothing, hear nothing—\nEmbrace the Spirit and remain still.\"*\n\n*The Parameters of the Mysterious* states:\n*\"The three treasures of ear, mouth, and eye—\nSeal them shut, let nothing pass through.\nThe True Person dwells in the deep abyss,\nFloating and guarding within the rule’s embrace.\"*\n\nAll the profound words in the scriptures cannot be exhausted.\nThe Great Compassionate One, Guanyin, through hearing, thinking, and cultivation,\nEnters samādhi.\n\nNow, the ear is the orifice for **leaking essence**—\nNot the leakage of post-heaven’s superficial desires,\nBut the **pre-heavenal Ta Yi’s true qi**, the **manifested essence of the original vitality**.\nIf one internally listens and seals the hearing,\nThen essence does not scatter, and wisdom arises.\n\nThe eye is the orifice for **leaking spirit**—\nNot the leakage of post-heaven’s deliberative spirit,\nBut the **pre-heavenal subtle form of luminous awareness**, the **original spirit of the Great Primordial’s misty haze**.\nIf one internally gazes and returns the clarity,\nThen it does not wander externally, and insight is born.\n\nTo uphold precepts and enter concentration—\nThen wisdom arises.\nWisdom arises, and water and fire unite.\nWater and fire unite, and **Kan and Li** are paired.\n**Kan and Li** paired, and **Heaven and Earth** are harmonious.\n**Heaven and Earth** harmonious, and **Metal and Wood** merge.\n**Metal and Wood** merge, and **hun and po** reunite.\n**Hun and po** reunite, and **essence and qi** transform.\n**Essence and qi** transform, and **divine powers manifest**.\nDivine powers manifest, and **light radiates**.\nLight radiates, and **merit is complete**.\nMerit complete, and the **Dharma-body is formed**.\nThe **Dharma-body formed**, and the **Dao-body is revealed**.\nThe **Dao-body revealed**, and **marvelous functions operate**.\nMarvelous functions operate, and **sentient beings are liberated**.\nSentient beings liberated, and **vows are fulfilled**.\nVows fulfilled, and the **great matter is accomplished**.\nThe **great matter accomplished**, and **rank and fruit are attained**.\n\nOnly this **One Vehicle** is true—\nThe other two are not genuine.\nFrom beginning to end, it does not depart from **sincerity**.\n*The Zhongyong* says:\n*\"Without sincerity, there is nothing.\"*\n\n**Things**—\nVague and indistinct, yet within them, there is substance;\nDark and obscure, yet within them, there is essence.\nTheir essence is most true, and within it, there is **faith**.\n**Faith** is **sincerity**—\nThis is what the *Yijing* speaks of as **\"qi and essence forming things\"**, the **\"material\" of the *Great Learning***.\n**Essence** is the **\"one essence\"** of the *Shangshu*.\n**Middle** is the **\"middle\"** of **\"its own middle\"**.\n\n*The Lotus Sutra* says:\n*\"There is a treasure hidden within the mountain of form,\nWhich the sages use to purify the heart and retreat into secrecy.\nAll are none other than this very thing—\nFirst retreat, then reveal.\"*\n\nAn ancient song says:\n*\"If this heart holds nothing at all,\nBefore your eyes lies the moment of submission.\"*\n\nWhat need for divine powers and marvelous functions?\nWhat need for wisdom and light?\nThese divine powers and marvelous functions\nAre the True Persons of the **Dao’s precepts** manifesting themselves\nTo liberate sentient beings, guiding delusion back to truth.\n\nThus, within the radiance of great wisdom,\nThe arm of compassion extends—\nRescuing all beings,\nFreeing them from suffering into tranquility.\nIt grants longevity to those with short lives,\nTransforming calamity into ease.\nIt brings peace to lands, extending life and preserving vitality.\nIt purifies sentient beings, making them virtuous and upright,\nBanishing demons, driving away the strong and rebellious,\nExterminating malevolent spirits.\nIt makes sentient beings merciful and non-killing,\nCausing them to preserve the **eon’s fate** and resolve grievances.\nIt shatters their darkness, revealing light.\nIt heals all diseases, dispelling ancient ailments.\nIt turns the foolish into the wise, leading them to the true and away from evil.\nIt makes them desireless and pure-hearted, gathering emotions back to nature.\nIt grants unobstructed liberation, transcending the mundane to become sage.\nIt accumulates merit and dispels calamity, bringing auspiciousness and eliminating sin.\nIt achieves transcendence and attains the **Dao**, escaping suffering to become immortal.\nIt enables cultivation of the **Highest Vehicle**, ascending to heaven,\nLeading all sentient beings, wandering the eight extremes,\nSurpassing celestial palaces.\n\nMay all sentient beings, in their ordinary forms,\nBecome **Dharma-kings**—\nEven beyond measure, called **divine powers**.\nNot revealing the secret in this age, called **marvelous functions**.\n\nThus, the divine powers of the **precepts, concentration, and wisdom** gate\nAre the **non-divine divine**—\nTransforming the six senses into the six **liberations**,\nCommunicating with heaven and earth,\nWith gods and ghosts,\nWith humans and things—\nThis is called **divine power**.\n\nThis **marvelous yet functional marvel**,\nWith one mechanism, demonstrates ten thousand transformations.\nTransforming **heavenly demons**, **earthly coalas**, **ten thousand ghosts**, **evil beings**, **monsters**—\nThis is called **marvelous function**.\n\nIn the **precepts and concentration** gate, one enters stillness,\nAnd light arises from **concentration and wisdom**—\nThe **pre-heavenal qi’s round and luminous auspicious form**.\nAbove, it communicates with the **Celestial Palace**, paying homage to the **Three Pure Ones**.\nBelow, it communicates with the **Underworld**, pardoning guilty spirits in the **Nine Abysses**.\n\nWhen teaching, celestial deities submit,\nThe Five Emperors attend in solemnity,\nTen thousand spirits guard in orderly ranks,\nEager to hear the true **Dharma** and refine their spirits back to emptiness.\nHaving attained liberation, with compassion and pity,\nThey rescue the suffering, cold, and lost,\nAnd the **Pure Assembly** praises, **Dìzhàng** shines forth,\nGhost judges obey, and the **Netherworld officials** submit,\nPardoning sins and granting rebirth,\nHearing the true **Dharma**, escaping the **Ghost Register**,\nAll ascending to **Extreme Bliss**.\n\nThus, self-liberation and liberation of others,\nTaking great vows—\nWishing all sentient beings to universally hear the **Highest Way**,\nUsing the **Dharma-medicine** to universally save all beings,\nEven the dull and moving with life,\nAll attain liberation.\nEarth and wood, tiles and rubble—\nAll respond and communicate.\nAll things’ emotions are thoroughly penetrated.\n\nDivine powers operate in **unaware unawareness**,\nAnd heaven and earth, ten thousand things, are within my body.\nMarvelous functions manifest in **natural spontaneity**,\nAnd mountains, rivers, stars, and constellations return to the **Law**.\n\nHeavenly demons all respectfully submit,\nBowing their heads in reverence.\nEarthly coalas are all transformed into benevolence,\nTheir reverent hearts subdued.\nFerocious and cruel ghosts, upon hearing, ascend and forever abandon blood offerings.\nAsuras and heterodox sects submit to the **Law** and return to correctness.\n\n「War forever ceases, grievances are fully resolved, and grudges dissolve.\nWith **virtue/power** to transform, not with force to subdue,\nThen wicked beings all become virtuous folk;\nWith **sincerity** to move, not with **craft** to ensnare,\nThen errant souls all return to righteousness.\n\nInverting the **Fighting Star** to govern **yin-yang**,\nYet gods and spirits cannot fathom its marvel;\nUpside-down wielding the **transformation-mechanism** beyond the world,\nAnd heaven and earth remain unaware.\n\nUniversal manifestation of divine luminosity,\nFirmly established in the **Law-body**,\nYet no form can be perceived.\nBroadly proclaiming the supreme **vehicle** of one wondrous **Law**,\nYet no sound can be heard.\n\nThe **void** is my **Law-realm**,\nI am the **Law-body** of the **void**.\nMingling indistinctly, I am one with heaven;\nUpright and vast, I am one in heart with **Daoist immortals** and **Buddhas**.\n\nZhengzi said:\n*\"Expanding, it fills the six directions;\nContracting, it retreats and hides in secrecy.\"*\nThis is what he meant.\n\nSo-called parent of all beings,\n**Daoist** master of the **Law**—\nIs it not the **divine powers** of tranquil liberation,\nThe **wondrous functions** of **non-action** and natural spontaneity?\n\nAll children,\nIf you do not cling to forms,\nThen your **wisdom** will be vast and boundless;\nIf you follow **heaven’s** natural course,\nThen your **wondrous functions** will be infinite.\n\nIt is simply about\nDiligently seeking the **Dao** in daily life without slacking,\nAnd in haste without abandoning—\nThe two characters **\"virtue/power\"** and **\"Way\"** alone.\n\nWhy then forsake **precepts** and **disciplinary laws** to study **talismans** and **ritual arts**,\nOr abandon **jade** and **precious gems** to cling to **coarse incantations**?\nWould you rather be the foolish multitude,\nNot learning the **supreme vehicle** of the **Way**?\n\nAlas! All children entering the **mystic gate**,\nShould seek the **supreme vehicle**.\nEach person contains a **wondrous secret**,\nEvery individual is inherently luminous.\n\nWhen **mindful attachments** arise, they bring many obstacles;\nWhen **precepts** are held lightly, they become mere hollow words.\nEven if **meditative focus** is strong,\nIf **resolve** is weak and **precepts** are not deeply held,\nThen **divine powers** and **wondrous functions** remain elusive.\n\nTo attain **divine powers** and **wondrous functions**,\nAll children must rely on **sincere progress**.\nIf you foolishly cling to forms in pursuit,\nThen a life in **ghostly caverns** will never lead to true **Way**.\n\nHeterodox sects and external **Dao** schools often dwell in shapes,\nClinging to **emptiness** while dwelling in **color**—\nThis is not true cultivation.\n\nNeither clinging to **emptiness** nor to **color**,\nWhen **meditative focus** is deep and **sincere response** is thorough,\nThen **divine powers** manifest naturally.\n\nWhen **wondrous functions** are wielded,\nThe **divine luminosity** distinguishes itself—\nYet how many **Daoists** lose the **central function**!\n\nI am not speaking at length for no reason—\nAh! I am revealing **heaven’s** true mechanism.\n\n**Divine powers** manifest, **wondrous functions** shine forth,\nThe **Law-king** of boundless **Dao**—\nNot departing from the **true constant** of tranquil stillness,\nThe **heretical teachings** submit in heart, and evil transforms into good.\n\nThose who defy filial piety and fraternal duty,\nUpon awakening, become instantly **benevolent and gentle**.\n**Wisdom** is like a mirror,\n**Illumination** like a **divine spirit**,\nA single **luminous platform** blazing brightly.\n\nThe **Six Perfections** interweave without trace of dust,\nAnd the earth, mountains, and rivers all become **gold**.\n\nAll children, do not neglect the **precepts** lightly held,\nFor they are the **heavenly ladder** by which you ascend step by step.\n\n**Divine powers** are unfathomable,\n**Wondrous functions** immeasurable—\nYet they never depart from **precepts** and **meditative focus**,\nThe **true constant** of **wondrous functions**.\n\nThe **gate** of **Thusness** has a **passage to heaven**,\nWithin the **non-dual fast**, **sacred fragrance** is exhaled.\n\nAll children, if you cultivate **sincerely** without self-abandonment,\nThen the **ancient Daoist** and **Buddhist** **Great Assembly Hall** is yours.\n\nTwenty years of enlightenment into **birth-and-death**—\nAll children, from ancient times to now,\nThe **sages**, **immortals**, **Buddhas**, and **patriarchs**,\nOnly for the sake of great **causes and conditions**,\nNine years facing the wall,\nSeeking urgently to penetrate **birth-and-death**,\nTo subdue the **heart of worldly existence**.\n\nHave you not heard?\n**Stone-fire**, **lightning-flash**, **falling flowers**, **fleeting water**—\nWhen **impermanence** arrives,\nNot even a moment can be retained.\n**Karma** follows the body,\nAnd **rebirth** brings retribution.\n\nWords not yet finished, yet the breath in the throat is severed,\nSpeech not yet uttered, yet the tongue shrinks and cannot sound.\nNaked and stripped, where shall you rest your body?\nDark and boundless, who shall stand firm in your fate?\n\nGreat **blessings** lead to rebirth in the world,\nEvil **deeds** plunge you into **Fengdu**’s depths.\nWhen **blessings** are exhausted, you return to **rebirth**,\nAnd when **karma** is complete, you transform into **beasts**.\n\nFor **aeons** you are ensnared by **grudges**,\nUnable to escape;\nFor **thousands of lives**, **guilt** cannot be erased.\n\nWorld after world, you sink in **delusion**,\nDrunken in **life**, dead in **dreams**.\n**Grudges** beget **grudges**,\nAnd you wear **horns** and **fur** as retribution.\n\nTo speak of it is painful and pitiful,\nTo recount it is sorrowful and terrifying.\n\nIf you do not **fix your resolve** and **establish your intention**,\nGrasping firmly your **innate moral nature**—\nUncovering the earth, overturning the heavens,\nAwakening to how **death** truly unfolds;\nSurrendering your **heart**, relinquishing your **life**,\nPiercing the **ignorance** of your **past lives**—\n\nIf you encounter a **resolute warrior**,\nWho raises his brows straight,\nAnd wields the **treasured sword** to cut **demons**—\nTruly a **great man**,\nWho releases his **great qi**,\nAnd severs **heresy** with a **sharp blade** in his heart.\n\nUltimately, you must see through:\nBefore your **parents** gave birth to you,\nWhere did you establish your **command**?\nAnd after **death** claims you,\nWhere shall you rest your **body**?\n\nAwakening to the **Three Bodies**—\nPast, future, and present—\nPursuing exhaustively the **Three Worlds**,\nAs if they were yesterday;\nThe **coming morning** is this very dawn.\n\nThus, all **thoughts** are dispelled,\nOnly this **luminous light** remains.\nAll **conditions** are swept clean,\nOnly that **illuminated nature** endures.\n\nEntering the **mystic gate**,\nOne **passage** opens, and all **passages** open;\nSeeing the **true teaching**,\nThen the **Three Realms** are clear, and the **Three Worlds** depart.\n\nLiberation means the **Five Elements** do not cling,\nAnd **void** stillness means the **Four Great Elements** return to **emptiness**.\n\nEntering the **gate of myriad wonders**,\nAscending to the **ground of the Three Jewels**,\nComing and going freely,\nTransformation without bounds—\n\nLightly turning **heaven’s** mechanism,\nThen **ghosts** and **spirits** cannot measure its **marvel**.\nMajestically reversing the **Fighting Star**,\nThen **yin-yang** cannot control its **authority**.\n\nSoaring in the **Vimalakirti’s** **subtle essence**,\nAttaining the **position** of **void** and **boundless** stillness—\nForever departing from **dusty kalpas**,\nEscaping the **cage of existence**.\n\nThe **Great Matter** of **Perfect Truth** is accomplished,\nLayer by layer, the **great path** is traversed,\nWithout practicing **discrimination** yet arriving swiftly.\n\nThis **wondrous Law-body** of **Dao**,\nAll its **secrets** are obtained from **illumination**—\nStep by step, **hidden techniques** are perfected,\nHow could one not awaken and achieve **harmony**?\n\nAll children!\nThe **Way** lies in **sacred transmission**,\nCultivation lies in **yourself**—」\n\nThe **virtue/power** comes from human accumulation,\nThe mirror comes from **Heaven**.\n\nFurther, one does not hear of **Heaven** dividing its **creative transformation** within the One,\nNor of humans establishing **dharma** and **precepts** from the heart.\n\nEach person must strive swiftly to uphold and practice,\nUrging themselves to press forward without delay.\n\nThose yet **unawakened** shall not lose the **auspicious cause**,\nThose who **pierce through** shall return to the **Celestial Realm**,\nWhile the **unawakened** shall not fall into the **hells**.\nAll children!\n\nEven if you knock with a **golden brick** at the gate,\nThe gate shall not open,\nYet the **golden brick** remains.\n\nTo uphold **precepts** and cultivate the **Dao** though still **unawakened**,\nIf the **precepts** persist,\nYou shall not sink into the **Netherworld**,\nUltimately reborn in the **yang** world.\n\nIf the **past causes** are not obscured,\nThe **fruit of realization** shall naturally manifest—\nJust a slight turn,\nAnd you still hold the **handle** in hand.\n\nAll children!\nDo not seek **birth-and-death** outside yourself.\nWhen **birth-and-death** is realized,\nOnly then do you know the **true essence** within the heart.\n\nI have spoken at length now,\nYet it amounts to no **method**.\nIf you **embody** the heart in this way,\nYou shall yourself find that **principle**.\n\n**Death** is examined in **life**,\n**Life** is realized in **death**—\nThis **mechanism** of **life-and-death**,\nThe **pathway** lies in human **transformation**,\nBy your will, not mine.\n\nTo seek **stillness** within **movement**,\nTo find **movement** within **stillness**,\nThen the **essence** of **movement-and-stillness**,\nAll depends on the **true knowing** within.\n\nYou may question the **heart**,\nBut you cannot question the **Teacher**.\nHeed my words carefully,\nAnd you shall never go astray.\nIf you do not follow my words,\nYou shall inevitably lag behind.\n\nThe dim lamp of my path\nGuides countless lost travelers through the dark.\n\nThis raft of suffering\nFerries guests across the endless ocean of the Ganges.\n\nDisciples, do not harbor doubt—\nWhen you recognize the truth, walk swiftly by night.\n\nThen, in the silent hall, voices rise in praise:\n*\"Where was home before birth?*\n*Where shall we return after death?*\n*Now, awaken to the Dharma-body,*\n*Lest you pass your prime with empty hands.*\n\n*Life and death intertwine—*\n*This

Pengzu now?\nWhere does Yanzi endure across kalpas?\nThe undying is my Dharma-body;\nThe ever-living is my primordial *qi*.\n\nEven the Tathagata has a time of quiescence,\nDeep in the realm of

Pass.\nNumberless as the void,\nNo immortal or Buddha bypasses this Great Way.\n\nThe clear path of heaven is plain—\nYet how can it save those lost in doubt?\nThe serene Buddha-land is pure—\nYet how can it free the common folk from their shackles?\n\nOnly those with shallow fortune and deep sin,\nThough they see, are blind as the sightless.\nMany bear heavy karmic burdens,\nThough alive, are

complete!\nLeave behind a name among mortals,\nPass down a teaching to the world,\nSo that in countless ages,\nSome may know of you.\n\nThis is to die yet not perish—*shou*.\nTo propagate the Dao across eons—\nThis is the body of perfect fulfillment,\nPerfect virtue, perfect fortune.\n\nDisciples,\nLife and death rest with you alone—\nNo one can save you.\nIf you do not cultivate yourself,\nNo one can do it for you.\nThoughts arise and vanish—\nYou cannot always grasp them.\nDelusion and selfishness—\nYou cannot always purge them.\nDeep attachments—\nYou cannot always abandon them.\nThe

resolve,\nRelying on teachers or leaning on fellow practitioners,\nClinging to names and forms,\nAll day and year,\nBlindly following others’ footsteps.\n\nInstead, fix your heart,\nUnshaken by doubt.\nWith single-minded devotion,\nUnwavering even unto death.\n\nWhen the moment is ripe,\nHas not Heaven never failed the resolute?\n\nThe Dao stands still and unmoving,\nYet those who respond may attain it.\n\nDisciples, if you truly cultivate fierce intent,\nPressing forward without hesitation,\nYearning without turning back—\nThis is high aspiration,\nThe seed of the Dao’s gate.\n\nThe Master’s silent verse,\nNot lightly revealed to all,\nNow I recite for you—\nListen closely.\n\n**\"The Verse Says:**\n\nLife and death are transient—awaken to this truth,\nDie alone, unconcerned by others’ eyes.\n\nDo not lean on others for your own salvation,\nEven gods and immortals must cross the river alone.\n\nNot just the six dusts and six senses,\nNor clinging to any single path—\nThe mind must dwell ever-present,\nYet neither cling to permanence nor to impermanence.\n\nKnowing the cause, you pierce through illusion’s veil—\nNo cause remains when wisdom dawns.\n\nOn the path of origin, you perceive the emptiness of self-nature,\nAt fruition, you awaken—who then abides in that void?\n\nFrom this day forth, sever life and death’s snare,\nErase the ledger of rebirth’s wheel.\n\nIf one follows the law with strict observance,\nHeaven’s unseen spirits will mark it well.\n\nThe Dragon Gate’s teaching is without foundation—\nHarsh words reveal its single truth.\n\nDo not cling to the law’s letter, sweep it aside,\nOnly then will the verse’s essence shine clear.\n\nStudy my words until the Dharma-body is known—\nThe void itself is the boundless treasure-house.\n\nMove, and thought arises without end,\nThe Dao’s storehouse within the body extends blessings.\n\nThe teaching merges with the mind, mind is the teaching—\nNo end to the long pole’s reach.\n\n**—*Scripture of the Azure Grove, Final Volume*\"**\n\n「The Twenty-Second Insight into the Primordial Source:\nAll disciples, this single point of unobscured void and spirit—\nIs it not easily seen? Who then is this Primordial Source, the True Person of my Essence?\n\nFrom ancient times to now, sages, immortals, Buddhas, and ancestral masters of the Dao,\nSat facing walls for nine years,\nOr meditated in circles for six seasons,\nCounting three threes and seven sevens,\nToiling and striving in earnest pursuit.\n\nThey traversed famous mountains and wandered blessed lands,\nSought teachers and questioned friends,\nInquired about the Way and listened to scriptures,\nPracticed austere deeds and accumulated virtue through almsgiving.\n\nAll manner of cultivation—\nYet only to grasp this body’s life and death, its great karmic cause,\nUnknown whence it came, unknown whither it goes,\nLost in wandering, sinking in rebirth,\nUnable to escape the Wheel of Existence—\nThus they vow and strive in practice.\n\nSome seek to sever thought and forget emotion,\nAs the path to transcendence,\nAnd sit in meditation for three or five years,\nBreaking countless *zazen* mats—\nYet how often has thought truly ceased,\nOr emotion been forgotten?\nThis is but the five returning to the ten.\n\nSome use *tianlian* (cooking lead) and *lianggong* (refining mercury)\nAs the path to transcendence,\nAnd perform morning and evening rituals—\nRetiring talismans, adding flames—\nYet how often have they seen the seven returns of the Jade Elixir,\nOr the nine returns of the Golden Elixir?\nHow often have they caught the thief,\nOnly to release the thief again?\n\nSome meditate on the Supreme Sovereign in silent devotion for three days.\nSome refine and liberate to aid the lost,\nRescuing wandering souls from the Nine Realms of the Underworld;\nSome call upon deities and summon generals,\nWearing talismans to command the True Persons;\nSome raise *qi* and open the gates,\nCirculating vital essence to proclaim the Wondrous Dao;\nSome recite scriptures and toil in worship;\nSome prepare elixirs to heal sickness and mend wounds;\nSome refine and consume alchemical substances,\nHoping to ascend to the heavens;\nSome imitate the *yin-yang* arts in gathering and taking;\nSome breathe within the *dingqi* vessel,\nUsing divine *qi* to transmute lead and prolong life and command;\nSome tend the sand-fire in the furnace,\nRefining *maogen* (hemp roots),\nEstablishing merit through almsgiving.\n\nSome cling to bodily suffering,\nEmbracing the *jin dan* (golden elixir) path,\nWaiting for transmission to those of fortune.\n\nSome, with shallow karmic roots,\nPractice the most difficult of deeds,\nYet abandon them at the cliff’s edge.\n\nAll these obscure the true nature,\nEngage in illusory cultivation—\nThey are but side paths.\n\nAll disciples,\nTo sever thought and forget emotion,\nYou must first perceive where thought arises,\nWhere emotion originates,\nTo grasp it firmly,\nTo press it steadily,\nTo recognize it truly,\nTo point it out clearly—\nOnly then may you proceed to sever,\nOnly then may you proceed to forget.\n\nNow I ask you:\nWho is this one who knows how to grasp,\nHow to seize,\nHow to recognize,\nHow to point out,\nHow to sever thought,\nHow to forget emotion?\n\nEven if you sever thought and forget emotion,\nBreak countless meditation mats—\nThought remains thought,\nEmotion remains emotion.\n\nThe assembly,\nSevering thought as thought,\nIs called *putting one’s head on top of one’s head*;\nForgetting emotion as emotion,\nIs called *catching the thief and releasing the thief*.\n\nBetter yet,\nTo forget the very law of forgetting,\nTo sever the very law of severing—\nBoth roots forgotten,\nEntering the Gate of Marvels—\nThis alone is the supreme teaching.\n\nAll disciples,\nWhen I sever thought from the law,\nYou do not know that the law itself is the thought’s origin;\nWhen I sever emotion from the law,\nYou do not know that the law itself is the seed of emotion.\n\nThe assembly,\nSevering thought is not as good as thought severing itself,\nForgetting emotion is not as good as emotion forgetting itself—\nThis is called *seeking others is not as good as seeking oneself*.\n\nAll disciples,\nThose who transmute lead and refine mercury,\nWho adjust the fire’s stages,\nWho mimic the *yin-yang* hexagrams—\nThey mutilate the *Taiqi* (Great Polarity) and *Hunyuan* (Chaos Primordial),\nTaking false names as true practice,\nPointing at metaphors as actual deeds.\n\nThey rashly speak of the Three Fields,\nBlindly guess at vital *qi* and essence,\nThe seven emotions as mechanical traps,\nThe nine orifices as pivotal hinges.\n\nThey take the seven characters and nine characters,\nThe returns and exchanges,\nAs seven times, nine times,\nSeven rounds, nine rounds,\nSeven stages, nine stages,\nSeven years, nine years,\nSeven transformations, nine transformations.\n\nThis drawing of diagrams,\nThat summoning of forms—\nToday it is *Kan* and *Li* (Water and Fire) interacting,\nTomorrow it is *Earth-Heaven* (Tai) harmony,\nThe day after it is *Hun* and *Po* (soul and spirit) merging,\nThis year it is the same infant,\nNext year it is the same infant—\nUntil nine years pass,\nStill an ignorant, unborn sinner.\n\nThey do not know their own errors,\nYet shake their heads,\nCurse their fingers,\nAnd face outsiders with false claims:\n*\"On that day, I conceived the holy child,\nThe fire’s stages were nurtured correctly,\nThe bathing time was not amiss—\nYet why, after ten months, does no infant appear?\nIs it because our fate is shallow, our sins deep,\nAnd the spirits do not allow fulfillment?\"*\n\nThey clutch their bellies,\nAge their faces,\nStrain their eyes,\nAnd shed hollow tears.\n\nDo you know these base-rooted, foolish ones?\nThey do not recognize their own heart,\nNor understand their true nature—\nTheir karma is thick as night,\nWhat wisdom could they possess?\nDo you know these people?\nThey still aspire upward,\nYet remain in darkness,\nUnawakened to the path of ascent.\n\nYour body’s essence and *qi*,\nAre the Primordial *Yuanqi* (Original *Qi*) and *Yuanjing* (Original Essence)—\nUnincreasing, undiminishing treasures.\nIf you stir them,\nThey do not grow;\nIf you do not stir them,\nThey do not wane.\n\nThis unobscured void and spirit—\nThe true essence—\nIs the Primordial Spirit.\n\nYet they say,\n*\"What is this Primordial Spirit?\nIs it not that infant?\"*\n\nFrom countless eons past,\nYour sins remain unexpiated,\nObstacles unsevered,\nThe heart’s source uncleaned,\nThe nature’s root unilluminated.\n\nYou do not early repent your transgressions,\nNor change your disposition,\nNor seek a teacher to awaken to the Way—\nInstead, you waste this precious, limited time,\nChasing that shadowy infant,\nFor what purpose?\n\nAll disciples,\n\nWithin your own bodies,\nYou know good and evil,\nYou know right and wrong,\nYou know corruption and rectitude,\nYou know birth and death,\nYou know self and other,\nYou know true and false—\nThis is the infant.\n\nYet this infant,\nOriginally does not know\nGood and evil, right and wrong,\nCorruption and rectitude, birth and death,\nSelf and other, true and false.\n\nThis infant does not cling to forms,\nNor does it generate mind from phenomena,\nNor mind from wisdom,\nNor wisdom from knowledge,\nNor knowledge from good to know evil,\nNor right to know wrong,\nNor rectitude to know corruption,\nNor birth to know death,\nNor self to know other,\nNor truth to know falsehood.\n\nOriginally devoid of *wōxiàng* (self-form),\nAnd devoid of *fēikōngxiàng* (non-empty form),\nIt merely responds to all things\nThrough this point of perception in the world’s movement.\n\nIf one speaks of *Tàijí* (Supreme Polarity) and *Hùnyuán* (Chaotic Unity),\nThen even this knowledge may be considered as *wúzhī* (non-knowledge).\n\nYet this knowledge is *liángzhī* (True Knowing),\nThe Buddhist school calls it *shànzhīshì* (Wise Knowing),\nThe Daoist school names it the *bāoyǐngyuánshén* (Infant Primordial Spirit).\n\nIn summary, all disciples,\nIt is merely this unobscured void-spirit essence—\nThe true nature of your being.\n\nYou only see Daoists enter the *yúnquán* (circular meditation chamber),\nPractice sitting in meditation,\nSpeak of nurturing the embryo (*huáitāi*),\nAfter ten months in seclusion,\nHave you ever seen any Daoist\nReveal the infant’s form,\nManifest its luminosity?\n\nBefore they enter the *yúnquán*,\nThey do not know\nThe states of Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and gods,\nThe principles of *yīnyáng* (yin-yang),\nThe calamities and blessings of humankind,\nThe auspicious or inauspicious in the future,\nNor their year of birth or day of death.\n\nAfter they leave the *yúnquán*,\nThey still do not know.\n\nIf they do not understand their own birth and death,\nThey cannot save themselves—\nHow can they save others?\n\nIf they do not comprehend their own birth and death,\nNor discern auspicious and inauspicious,\nBound by Heaven and Earth as they are,\nTheir birth is no different from the common folk’s sufferings,\nTheir death is no different from the ordinary’s fate—\nBuried in filth, decaying in stench.\n\nThen this entering the *yúnquán* to sit in meditation,\nIs it not merely futile?\n\nAll disciples,\nYou must first forget the mind of death,\nThen enter the *yúnquán*;\nYou must first sever the ties of desire,\nThen practice sitting in meditation.\n\nWhen lustful thoughts are long extinguished,\nThe kidneys suffice,\nAnd true *lián* (lead) ascends.\n\nWhen angry thoughts are long extinguished,\nThe heart becomes void,\nAnd true *gōng* (mercury) descends.\n\nWhen diet is regulated in accordance with the seasons,\nThe spleen grows strong,\nAnd mercury and lead are sealed and fixed.\n\nWhen emotions are emptied,\nThe lungs are moistened,\nAnd when the nature is settled,\nThe liver flourishes,\nAnd the kidneys’ waters abound—\nThen the eyes shine brightly,\nAnd the pupils are like black lacquer.\n\nWhen the heart’s fire is quenched,\nThe mouth’s saliva fills,\nAnd its taste is as sweet as *lì* (fermented rice drink).\n\nWhen the spirit is pure,\nThe liver’s *qi* flows smoothly,\nAnd the sinews and bones grow light.\n\nWhen the ethereal soul is at peace,\nThe lungs’ fluids circulate,\nAnd the hair and beard turn dark.\n\nWhen the spleen is robust and the stomach harmonious,\nThe tongue and throat are agile,\nAnd the voice resounds clear.\n\nWhen the orifices are open and the blood is abundant,\nAll diseases are repelled;\nWhen the five flavors are bland,\nTrue *qi* arises.\n\nBy practicing *tāoyǐn* (guiding and pulling exercises)\nIn accordance with the four seasons and eight periods,\nYou can resist the intrusion of wind, cold, heat, and dampness.\n\nBy restraining the six desires and seven emotions,\nAnd subduing the nature to calm the mind,\nYou can ward off the influence of demons and malevolent spirits.\n\nBy seeking the Great Dao,\nTrue Knowing manifests,\nAnd the true nature is illuminated.\n\nWhen you awaken to *zhēnrú* (Suchness),\nThe physical form becomes void,\nAnd the Dharma-body is revealed.\n\nFirst save yourself,\nThen save others—\nBut ultimately, it is to save yourself.\n\nAll disciples,\nAt this stage,\nYou have only taken the first step\nThrough the great gate.\n\nThen, enter the *yúnquán* to sit in stillness,\nAscend to Heaven,\nDescend to Earth,\nAnd perceive the states of ghosts and gods,\nThe mechanisms of Heaven and Earth—\nAll within the breath’s span,\nAll within the grasp of creation.\n\nThis is all achieved through *jièdìng* (restraint and meditation).\n\nThus, when entering the *yúnquán*,\nYou are but a mortal embryo and ordinary bones;\nWhen leaving the *yúnquán*,\nYou are a sacred body and Dharma-form.\n\nUnderstanding the Great Dao,\nYour vision expands—\nYou see through all ties as illusory and false.\n\nWith a staff in hand,\nYour heart broadens—\nYou embrace Heaven and Earth within the boundless void.\n\nBefore others act, I already know;\nBefore events unfold, I foresee.\n\nOnly then is it the *liùtōng* (Six Perfections),\nWith boundless wisdom—\nAll heavenly demons bow in submission,\nAnd the Dark Protectors (*àn hù*) reverently guard.\n\nAll external paths of the ten directions submit,\nAnd all tremble in awe.\n\nWithin a sesame seed,\nThe *xūmíshān* (Sumeru Mountain) is contained—\nUnperceived.\n\nWithin a grain of millet,\nThe ten-directional worlds are hidden—\nUnknown.\n\nAt will, you roam\nThe vast Earth and mountains and rivers—\nUnfettered.\n\nAt will, you retreat\nInto the subtlest dust or grain—\nSecure.\n\nAll disciples,\nThis Dao of effortless ascent to the utmost truth is first\nIn discerning the subtle principles and awakening to Heaven’s mysteries.\n\nThus, you must abandon\nAll blind meditation, chaotic sitting,\nCooking lead and refining mercury,\nConcentrating on thoughts and visualizations,\nPurifying and transforming to aid the lost,\nSeeking official titles and records,\nShaking fans to gather *qi*,\nReciting sutras and chanting scriptures,\nMixing medicines and burning incense,\nAnd all other practices of alchemical furnaces—\nThese myriad futile affairs,\nDo not hasten to them,\nBut set them aside entirely.\n\nSincerely and earnestly,\nMake vows to Heaven,\nSwear with resolve.\n\nFrom this day onward,\nAnd into the future,\nMay you swiftly comprehend\nThe mysteries of birth and death,\nEscape the suffering of cyclic existence,\nAvoid all false paths,\nAnd attain the wondrous Dao.\n\nAh!\nThis saying of *\"avoiding all false paths\"* (*lí zhǒngzhǒng biān*)\nIs indeed the great expedient gate\nFor discerning the subtle principles and awakening to Heaven’s mysteries.\n\nAll disciples,\nWhat are these *\"false paths\"*?\n\nThey are blind meditation, chaotic sitting,\nCooking lead and refining mercury—\nAll these peripheral practices.\n\nWhat is *\"false\"*?\nPeripheral practices are neither central nor correct.\nLike a table’s edges,\nThese peripheral paths lie at the four sides—\nThey cannot enter the heart.\nEven if they enter the heart,\nThey do not leave the table.\nYet you do not realize:\nOnly by leaving the table\nCan one attain the void’s Great Dao.\nIf you cannot leave the table,\nYou remain but an object—\nNot the Dao—\nIs this not *\"false\"*?\n\n*\"False\"* means seeking (*xún*),\nIt means deviation (*xié*),\nIt means boundary (*jiè*),\nIt means shore (*yá*).\n\nPeripheral means not central,\nDeviation means not upright.\nWith boundaries,\nYou cannot be vast and boundless;\nWith shores,\nYou cannot be profound and pure.\n\nClinging tightly to this fleshly sack,\nmistaking it for a thousand-year-old cypress,\na ten-thousand-year-old green pine—\nonly to suffocate the true protagonist alive.\n\nInstead, you abandon the lamp to seek fire,\ncling to the false while discarding the true—\nis this not tipping to one side?\n\nEven if you succeed,\nyou remain but a *self-liberated one*.\n\nYou have not yet seen your true nature—\nthough you attain fruition,\nyour merits exhausted, you still enter the wheel of rebirth,\nstruggling to transcend the Three Realms.\nWhat benefit do you bring to these beings?\n\nDisciples,\nto become an immortal, a Buddha,\na sage, or a worthy—\nall lies in abandoning self for others,\nin vowing to liberate all beings.\n\nNow, these practitioners who sit in meditation\ncannot even liberate themselves—\nhow could they liberate others?\nCalled *self-liberated ones*,\nhave they ever truly understood the Great Dao,\nthe boundless liberation of all?\n\nThey linger in peripheral practices—\ndeeply pitiable!\n\nThe True Lord speaks in verse,\nrevealing the true mechanism,\nteaching the assembly to abandon self-seeking\nand to step beyond one-sided methods.\n\nThus, those of peripheral teachings\nreturn to the central path,\nwhile deviant doctrines revert to the true law.\nBounded realms are opened into boundlessness,\nthe vast world unfolds to reach heaven and earth,\nchanneled ditches with shores are widened into limitless expanse.\nThe unfathomable Dharma-body\nexpands into formlessness, beyond self and other.\n\nThe scriptures say:\n*\"Seeing without seeing me,\nhearing without hearing me,\nleaving all boundaries—\nthis is called the wondrous Dao.\"*\n\nDisciples,\nthe gate to realization begins with an open mind.\nFrom where does life arise?\nTo where does death return?\nSeek the lofty, enlightened teachers,\nthe wise and sincere friends.\nNurture boundless compassion,\nand investigate thoroughly.\n\nLife is like a cup of tea—\nconstrained by form, the water retains its taste.\nPour it into the Eastern Ocean,\nand it becomes vast waves and surging tides.\nIf you seek my original source,\nsaying the water is now tea because of added flavor—\nthen it has color and form.\nYet within this ocean’s depths,\nmy original source resides.\nWhat, then, is my original source?\nInvestigate carefully,\nuntil seeing without sight,\nhearing without sound.\n\nWith prolonged cultivation,\nthe chest suddenly opens,\nthe vision clears to the ground—\nthe original face is seen,\nthe subtle mechanism revealed,\nand the true nature confirmed:\nthe Dao was never unworthy of humanity!\n\nDisciples,\nthe sages, immortals, and Buddhas have long ascended.\nTo see their hearts,\nfirst clarify their principles.\nClarifying their principles,\nyou awaken to their methods,\nand act in their deeds.\nActing in their deeds,\nyou become their embodiment.\n\nDisciples,\nwhere is the heart of the sages, immortals, and Buddhas?\nIt lies within each person’s *fangcun* [heart-mind].\nWhere is their principle?\nIt stands before each person’s eyes.\nWhere is their method?\nIt is within the scriptures and histories.\nTheir deeds do not exceed worldly law—\nthey are found within worldly affairs.\nTheir bodies reside in their very core.\n\nIf you know the sages’, immortals’, and Buddhas’ hearts\nwithin your *fangcun*,\nyou can clarify their principles.\nClarifying their principles,\nyou awaken to their methods.\nAwakening to their methods,\nyou can act in their deeds.\nClarifying their principles,\nthe true path is preserved.\nAwakening to their methods,\nall conditions are realized.\nActing in their deeds,\nmeritorious deeds are established—\nand the celestial mechanism never ceases,\nenduring through countless kalpas.\n\nKnow that such a person’s supernatural powers and wisdom\nalready embody the sages’, immortals’, and Buddhas’ essence—\nthis is their heart.\n\nThen, receiving the *Zhongji* Precepts,\nthe nature is opened,\nthe Mystic Pass unblocked—\nand you can clarify their principles.\nThen, receiving the *Tianxian* Precepts,\ndelving into profound truths,\nwisdom becomes boundless—\nand you can traverse their Dao.\n\nThen, liberated without obstruction,\nround or square,\nvast or small,\nmoving or still,\nforward or backward,\nalive or dead,\nbent or stretched,\nexiting or entering,\nsage or worthy,\nimmortal or Buddha—\nyou can manifest in the Four Births,\nthe Six Realms,\nheaven or emptiness,\nor the underworld.\nAdapting teachings to each,\nyou liberate beings through kalpas.\nTransformation is unfathomable,\nmanifesting in person to teach.\n\nLike a boundless mirror reflecting all forms,\nmutually containing—\nyou can act in their deeds,\nbecome their embodiment,\nand attain their fruition.\n\nDisciples,\nthis is called *parametrizing subtle principles*\nand *awakening to celestial mechanisms*.\n\nLong ago, the Yellow Emperor lost his *Xuanzhu* [Mysterious Pearl]\nin the Red River,\nand sent *Lizhu* to retrieve it—\nbut *Lizhu* could not find it.\nThen he sent *Qie Gou*—\n*Qie Gou* could not find it.\nFinally, he sent *Wangxiang*—\nand *Wangxiang* obtained it.\n\n*Lizhu* was one who dwelled in the *Ligong* [Red Palace],\nthe post-heavenal fleshly cluster of the heart—\nthus he could not find it,\nsymbolizing those today who cling to one-sided views.\n\n*Qie Gou* was one who clung to defilements,\npracticing purity of mouth and body,\nrelying on fasting—\nyet even this refined heart could not attain it.\n\nAs for *Wangxiang*,\nhow did he succeed?\n\nThe *Wángxiàng*—*wáng* means \"none,\" *xiàng* means \"form and color.\"\nThus, *Wángxiàng* refers to that which is formless and colorless.\n\nTherefore, it is not called the *Bright Pearl*, but the *Xuanzhu* [Mysterious Pearl].\nJust as the most exalted Sage-Teacher Confucius said:\n*\"That which transcends form is called the Dao/Way;\nthat which is within form is called instruments.\"*\n\nAnd the Supreme Old Ancestor [Laozi] proclaimed:\n*\"Look inward to the heart—\nthe heart has no heart;\nlook outward to the form—\nthe form has no form.\"*\n\nDisciples,\nthis is the fundamental truth of ultimate reality.\nSages of sages, Daoists of Daoists, Buddhas of Buddhas—\nall abide in non-clinging, non-manipulation.\n\nIf one clings to forms in practice,\nthen the Yellow Emperor would have sought the *Xuanzhu* through wisdom,\nfasting, and purity—\nand yet still failed to obtain it.\n\nDisciples!\nThe Yellow Emperor lost the *Xuanzhu* and found it through *Wángxiàng*;\nordinary mortals grasp profound truth through the *wu-xin* [heartless] multitude.\n\nI have fully revealed the celestial mechanisms,\nunveiled the heart-seal.\nYet you must scrutinize carefully,\nguard vigilantly—\nlest the *Xuanzhu* be lost in the Red River,\nand you never know where to seek it again!\n\nThus, I admonish the disciples to bow in reverence and listen to the gāthā:\n\n*\"A thousand scrolls of Daoist scriptures cannot exhaust it,\none direct pointer reveals it utterly.\nI urge you not to dabble in myriad methods—\nthe Dao/Way lies in the heart, not in books.\n\nClinging to forms while seeking the Mysterious—\nendless delusions arise.\nWith intent in meditation, one becomes a demon.\nMany stray down false paths,\nwhile the straight path stands unchallenged.\n\nThe True Person has no form, no shape—\na segment of celestial mechanism displayed everywhere.\nDo not grope blindly before your eyes,\nnor abandon the true path for side doors.\"*\n\nAt that time, Kunyangzi Putong, having completed his dedication to the assembly, admonished his disciple Shi Shouping to compile the teachings into a written record. He then presented it to the Master of the Precepts for inscription to benefit later generations. The Master of the Precepts replied:\n\n*\"No need. Simply pass it down from person to person. After one hundred and seventy years, it shall be established as the* **Jìyuàn Tánjīng** *.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Nowadays, the Three Refuges are treated as mere convention—morning and evening before the sacred images, one merely recites and pays homage, without ever truly penetrating the essence of taking refuge. Why then does one come? Thus, one ultimately remains mired in heretical teachings and cannot escape the cycle of rebirth. How then can one attain the Great Dao and transcend birth and death?\n\n*(She Shi’s note: The above two sections concern matters of principle.)*\n\nThose who speak of taking refuge in the Three Jewels must do so in truth. Taking refuge in **intention (意)**, one cultivates the thought of impermanence, and thus the Jewel of the Dao may be illuminated. Taking refuge in **mind (心)**, one removes all obstructions, and thus the Jewel of the Scripture may be awakened. Taking refuge in **body (身)**, one renders the eyes blind to sight, the ears deaf to sound, the nose insensitive to scent, the tongue unable to taste, the hands restrained from movement, and the feet from wandering—untainted by lust, deceit, or impurity—practicing austerities, laboring the sinews, starving the flesh, weakening the limbs, and abandoning the physical form. Only then may one truly invoke the Jewel of the Teacher.\n\n*(She Shi’s note: What is meant by taking refuge in intention, mind, and body are already practical methods. In the initial stages of the Dao of the Elixir, if one takes refuge in intention, the True Gentleman (真士) naturally arises; if one takes refuge in mind, True Fire manifests; if one takes refuge in body, the body remains still while True Water emerges. The foundation of the Dao of the Elixir lies in the purity of the water source, and its greatest key lies in two things: one, if the body does not move recklessly, the water is pure; if the body moves recklessly, the water is turbid; two, if the fire is pure, the water is pure, but if the fire is turbid, the water is also turbid. Thus, taking refuge in the body and in the mind naturally makes foundation-building effortless. And when all three Jewels are taken as refuge, the practice can progress layer by layer.)*\n\nIf one can move the Teacher’s compassion and receive transmission of the Scripture and the Dao, it must be through taking refuge in one’s own body, mind, and intention as the true Three Jewels. My own ears and eyes have not yet forgotten their seeing and hearing—whether lost in the illusions of form or attached to emptiness. So long as sound and color remain, the body is not true. How then can it invoke the Teacher?",

Though the practice has no fixed stages, it naturally progresses layer by layer. Kunyangzi, in compassion for later generations, revealed this Dao in this scripture. Alas, today’s people pass by in a daze, failing to grasp the meaning beyond the words.

tumultuous,\nTossing and roaring, their ascent and descent unmeasurable,\nRolling and turning with no fixed course.\n\nSince the beginning of the kalpas, it has been said:\nNo hope of escape, an endless sea of suffering.\n\nNow, to take refuge in this mind,\nYou must first recognize that this mind is but a clump of congealed flesh and blood,\nFar from being a lasting, benevolent substance.\n\nIt relishes sound and color, fearing neither transgression of the precepts nor punishment;\nIt indulges in sweet foods, heedless of losing life or limb.\nIt sinks into the torments of hungry ghosts and animal rebirths without dread,\nNor does it flinch at being cast into fiery mountains or burning pits.\nIt drifts through plagues and calamities without hesitation,\nNor avoids causing stars to fall or mountains to crumble.\nAll manner of calamitous causes—\nThis mind alone summons them and sets them in motion.\n\nThe Six Bandits march as vanguard, the Seven Emotions lead as generals.\nIf one seeks to practice without first taking refuge in this mind,\nHow could they subdue demons and spirits,\nRemove the Seven Hindrances and banish evil,\nPenetrate the fundamental principle,\nObtain the true Dharma,\nDelve deeply into the essence,\nAnd attain the highest vehicle?\n\nYet to master this mind,\nOne must again uphold the precepts while cultivating *mingxin* (冥心) and entering *ding* (定).\nReining in the horse with the bridle and whip,\nTurning back the wind and extinguishing the flames.\nWhen this mind’s unenlightened fire is quenched,\nThen the water of forbearance may conquer it.\nTransforming the raging flames into the wind of wisdom,\nChanging unenlightenment into great knowledge.\nShifting evil causes into virtuous fruits,\nDissolving sorrow and resentment into joy and delight.\nRising above sound and color as fleeting dust,\nConverting sloth and arrogance into reverence.\n\nWithout delusion or murkiness,\nNo confusion of right and wrong,\nNo battling between attachment and aversion,\nNo vacillation in coming and going,\nNo shifting in gain and loss—\nThen naturally, *qi* settles and the mind grows still,\nMind still and *qi* settled,\nAnd the scriptural refuge may be taken.\n\n**Assemblage!**\nHaving now cultivated the power of *ding* (定),\nTo subdue this mind of congealed flesh and blood,\nThen the winds and waves grow tranquil,\nThe waters smooth and the moon ascends,\nPearls radiate clarity, wisdom illuminates the scriptures,\nAnd insight penetrates the teachings’ depths.\nYou must next take refuge in this *yi* (意).\n\nThis *yi* is yet more difficult to subdue than this mind—\nThe mind seeks rectitude, but *yi* lies in sincerity.\nSincerity is the state of *shenmi* (慎密).\n\n*Ding* (定) is within this *shenmi* (慎密),\nWith clarity and distinctness,\nNo obstruction of light or shadow,\nNo duality, no cessation,\nMotion and stillness in perfect harmony,\nIllumination universal.\n\nThus, without taking refuge in *yi*,\nEven the mind’s *ding* and stillness remain uncertain.\nIt secretly plots and seizes power,\nIts schemes mechanical and deceitful;\nFantastic and delusive, it fluctuates wildly—\nSometimes present, sometimes gone.\nIts machinations are manifold,\nSwiftly vanishing, swiftly arising,\nLike dragons or tigers in cunning guise.\nUncatchable as shadows or wind,\nThough one may grasp at it,\nIt has no form to see.\n\nA single spark can ignite a thousand *jun* (钧) of force,\nA single drop can flood a thousand *hu* (斛) of water,\nIts stratagems countless, its designs vast.\nIts power unfathomable—\nIt can steal the day and deceive the heavens,\nIts guile boundless.\nOnly after taking refuge in *yi* does it dissolve like water,\nAs if all things return to spring.\n\nThen one may enter sainthood and attain truth,\nAscend to immortality and grasp the Dao.\nIn the mundane world, one may transform and guide,\nBringing peace to the realm and stability to the people,\nHarmony to the seasons and abundance to the harvest,\nAnd cultivate loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness.\n\nThe Three Bonds and Five Relationships arise from sincere *yi*,\nThe Nine Schools and Three Teachings manifest from sincere *yi*.\nBetween sincerity and insincerity,\nSuffering and fortune, calamity and blessing,\nAll depend on this *yi*.\nIt is the cause of life and death,\nThe handle of rebirth and karmic retribution.\n\n**Assemblage!**\nIf *yi* is not sincere before its stirrings,\nThe mind’s delusion remains unchecked—\nLike stars following the Big Dipper’s pivot.\nWhen *yi* is sincere,\nOne may seize the power of life and death.\nWhen *yi* is insincere,\nWho wields the reins of rebirth?\n\n**Assemblage!**\nWithin your own mind lies the *yi*-Jewel,\nA single thought of purity—\nAbove, it connects with the heavens,\nBelow, it reaches the underworld.\nGhosts and spirits lose their hue,\nThe sun and moon their luster,\nCreation its authority,\nYin and yang their order,\nDemons and fiends flee their traces,\nAll beings vanish—\nAll from this *yi*.\n\nWithin the Three Realms, *yi* alone reigns supreme.\nRelease it, and it exists;\nWithdraw it, and it vanishes.\nAt will, it expands or contracts—\nNothing exceeds this *yi*.\n\n*Yuanqi* (元始) as ancestral breath,\n*Fangong* (梵空) as sacred essence,\n*Taishang* (太上) as true breath,\n*Haoji* (浩气) as boundless breath,\n*Yuanqi* (元气) as condensed and harmonious breath,\n*Yangqi* (阳气) as compassionate and benevolent breath,\n*Yinqi* (阴气) as harsh and punitive breath,\n*Xueqi* (血气) as violent and unrestrained breath,\n*Yeqi* (邪气) as licentious, murderous, thieving, and false,\n*Mogui* (魔气) as obstinate and obstructive,\n*Yaogui* (妖气) as cruel and dark,\n*Yuangui* (怨气) as oppressive and vengeful—\nAll arise from the **Assemblage!**\n\nIf the body does not take refuge in the Teacher-Jewel,\nIt will run wild with ferocity.\nIf the mind does not take refuge in the Scriptural-Jewel,\nIt will be mired in confusion and darkness.\nIf *yi* does not take refuge in the Dao-Jewel,\nIt will be entangled in myriad difficulties.\n\nWhen *yi* is partial and insincere,\nIt loses the

      "translated_text": "Above, the **Confession and Aspiration Text** is to be recited devoutly morning and evening.\nOne must, with one’s own **Dharmakāya**, before the **Emperor of Heaven**, in every thought, surrender sincerely—\nwith every heartfelt remorse, each utterance clear and resonant,\neach syllable repented with trembling resolve,\nand press forward with fierce, unwavering determination.\n\nLife and death, existence and annihilation,\nsuffering, hardship, hunger, and cold—\nall must be relinquished without hesitation.\nOnly by holding fast to **precepts and concentration** shall one secure one’s path forward.\n\n---\n**Scripture of the Jade Terrace, Volume Four: On Severing Obstacles**\nFor those who practice, if obstacles are not severed,\nthey are blocked and plunged into darkness.\nIf hindrances are not removed,\nthey remain dull and obscured.\n\nThe true nature of the mind is as boundless as heaven and earth,\nyet deluded emotions drift like fleeting clouds.\nWhen mist shrouds the azure sky, how can the sun’s brilliance shine?\nWhen passions cloud the sacred faculties, how can the true principle unfold?\nIs this not the great affliction of the practitioner?\n\nNow I reveal the root of these obstacles.\nThe **Dao** speaks of two kinds: **obstacles of principle** and **obstacles of action**.\nIf one does not grasp their nature, truth and falsehood cannot be distinguished;\nif one does not grasp their essence, right and wrong cannot be discerned.\nIf one clings to principle while neglecting action, one becomes rigid and dull—\nthis is the **obstacle of principle** in the heart.\nIf one acts while harming principle, one becomes perverse and distorted—\nthis is the **obstacle of action**, corrupting one’s nature.\nWhether in principle or action, any attachment becomes an obstacle.\n\nNow I explain these two terms in detail.\nHonored assembly, countless scriptures and teachings exist,\nall from the enlightened and wise of old,\nseeking to guide later generations\nto do good and learn virtue,\nto awaken to the **Dao** and cultivate the true self.\nYet beings do not do good but instead do evil,\ndo not learn virtue but instead learn vice,\ndo not cultivate the true but instead feign it,\ndo not awaken to the **Dao** but instead betray it—\nthis is the **obstacle of action** in one’s original nature.\n\nAgain, there are monastic practitioners\nwho do good yet cling to goodness,\nlearn virtue yet cling to virtue,\ncultivate the true yet fixate on its form,\nawaken to the **Dao** yet become ensnared by its traces—\nall because they have not transcended their attachments.\nThis is called the **obstacle of principle** in one’s original nature.\n\nYet even these two—obstacles of principle and action—\nare still afflictions of those striving upward.\nThere is another kind of practitioner\nwhose mind remains unenlightened,\nwhose divine potential has not yet turned.\nWherever they go, obstacles arise.\nSeeing those who strive upward\npreach scriptures or uphold precepts,\nthey may outwardly praise them\nwhile secretly stirring **delusion**,\ngenerating an **obstacle of the heart** and **deluded thoughts**.\n\nHonored assembly, if this **obstacle of the heart** is not severed,\nhow can one escape the sea of suffering?\nThough there are boats and rafts,\nsails and oars—\nthough the path across the sea is clear—\none still does not dare to cross, cannot cross.\nWhy is this?\n\nIt is because this **obstacle of the heart**\nis like a sudden storm cloud rising in the sky,\ndarkening all before it,\nthreatening wind and rain,\nsummoning monstrous waves and fierce tides—\nthus one does not dare to cross, cannot cross.\n\nHonored assembly, the sea of suffering is boundless,\nbut turning back is the shore.\nThe practitioner’s obstacles\nare like black clouds surging upward,\na deceitful omen concealing the heavens.\nOnly when they are severed\ndoes the sea grow calm, the winds still,\nand one attains ease and freedom—\nthen, and only then, can one cross to the other shore.\n\nHave you not heard it said in the *Scripture of the Highest Jade Emperor’s Original Conduct*?\n*\"Because beings bear heavy obstacles,\nthey cannot behold the Emperor’s merciful countenance.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"All these obstacles—\nyou must each sever them.\"*\n\nThus the **Imperial Scripture** begins by proclaiming the severing of obstacles.\nThe method to sever them is to cultivate **great wisdom**,\nto abandon all doubt, all greed and anger,\nall lust, all jealousy and malice,\nall worldly thoughts and worldly musings,\nall dullness and filth,\nall attachment to sounds and forms,\nall quarrels of right and wrong,\nall hatred and love,\nall discrimination,\nall arrogance and fixation.\n\nConcentrate the spirit, purify the mind—\nlet all passions submit.\nLet the heart be as boundless space,\npure within and without.\nReceive all without exclusion,\nadmit all without resistance.\nDo not let external evils disrupt the **True Path**,\nlure you from the **True Teaching**,\ncorrupt your **sacred root**,\nor steal your **precious essence**.\nOtherwise, you shall for ten thousand kalpas\nsink into the mundane realm,\nfall into the snares of the world,\nbe assailed by myriad demons,\nsuffer countless kalpas without hearing the **wonderful dharma**,\nbe punished by ghosts and spirits,\nand wander from birth to death.\n\nTherefore, you must resolve with determination\nto safeguard the **True Teaching**,\nlest it be lost.\nAs previously stated,\neach must sever these obstacles—\nfor these are the very conditions of **obstacles**.\n\nIf they are not severed,\nthe six senses will be defiled,\nthe three actions will ensnare you,\nand you shall never attain **tranquility**.\nIf you do not attain **tranquility**,\nhow can you behold the Emperor’s merciful countenance?\nHow can you attain the **Seventeen Radiant Lights** or the **Thirty Virtues**?\n\nFor the Emperor’s radiant virtues and merits\nare the domain of all **Buddhas and Holy Teachers**,\nthe **Imperial Masters of Heaven**.\nThe **three volumes and five categories** of wondrous scriptures\nall arise from severing obstacles.\n\nHonored assembly, the obstacles of the world are countless.\nThe **Imperial Scripture** merely outlines their general forms,\nso you may grasp their essence and understand the **Dao’s** path.\n\nYou must realize:\nthe subtle obstacles of the world\nare myriad and countless—\nevery thought, every impulse,\ntoo numerous to enumerate.\nFor instance, when reading scriptures or reciting texts,\ntheir profound meanings are deep and hidden.\nSince your own wisdom is limited,\nyou cannot fathom them—\nthus you know your **mind’s faculties** are not yet awakened,\nyour **wisdom-light** is still dim.\n\nYet you refuse to humble yourself,\nto question the enlightened—\nthis is **filth**.\nAnd when you do ask,\nyou still harbor doubts,\nfearing the speaker’s words may not be true.\nYou question another,\nyet their answers differ—\nyour heart fills with vexation,\nbranching into countless contradictions.\nIs this not

How tragic to see the purity of their initial vow—those sacred robes, that ceremonial scarf—cast into the Eastern Sea, sold, repurposed into common garments, or patched into sleeves. They profane the divine, defiling the sacred hall. They turn the pure alms bowl into an incense burner, storing money or rice within. They break their fasts, violate their vows, drink wine, eat meat without restraint, extinguishing their wisdom and severing their path to transcendence.\n\nThere are living cases to prove this. Once, a monk destroyed his precepts, defiled the *戒经* (Precept Scripture), sold his robes and alms bowl, then died suddenly. Ghostly officers seized him with chains. In the underworld, he saw a grand hall, its doors flanked by ranks of ghostly officers, binding countless former companions—all broken preceptists who had died in their transgressions.\n\nThe monk trembled and asked, *\"How did you come here?\"*\nThe others replied, *\"We do not know why, but we have all gathered here, one after another.\"*\n\nAbove the gate hung a plaque: *考对司* (Examination Bureau). He asked the ghostly officers, *\"What is this Examination Bureau?\"*\nThey answered, *\"This is a newly established heavenly decree. There are two judicial halls overseeing monastic and Daoist precepts. Whoever in the mortal world takes the precepts has their name recorded by the Earth Deities. On this day, they received the precepts; on that day, they upheld them with merit; on another, they committed offenses. This one violated the precepts, that one betrayed the Dao and defied the teacher. This one sold his robes, that one defiled his bowl. This one slandered the precept masters, that one harmed donors. This one was greedy, that one indulged in lust—all recorded in detail. Each month, the records are submitted to the respective bureaus for examination. Only after passing this bureau’s scrutiny may one proceed to other halls. Those who uphold the precepts with virtue and strict resolve need not appear here. But those like you, who never took the precepts, will first be examined and expelled from the records before your scheduled death is enforced. If you fail this bureau’s review, no other hall will accept you.\"*\n\nListen, fellow preceptists—this monk who died has already returned for half a day, recounting this truth.\n\nYou may criticize others’ faults with clarity, yet when your own failings arise, you turn a blind eye, accumulating sins day by day, granting yourself endless pardons while hiding them—this is called *欺心* (self-deception). Those who have taken the precepts must scrutinize their every thought, word, and deed. If wrong, correct it immediately. Do not excuse yourself. Do not forgive yourself. If you err and have not yet reflected, repent humbly before the Sacred Truth, confessing sincerely according to the *戒经*’s laws. Study diligently with a wise teacher, delving into profound teachings.\n\nRevere your masters as parents, your fellow practitioners as elder brothers, the *dharma* as a beloved spouse, and the scriptures as precious jade. Hold the precepts in your heart as you would an object in your hand—let it slip, and they are lost. The world’s laws punish transgressions with punishment; the heavenly *Dao*’s *女青之律* (Laws of the Azure Maiden) demand retribution.\n\nDo not think the underworld is unseen—life and death unfold within your mind. Do not think the precept deities are hidden—they manifest in your every thought.\n\n*戒行精严* (Precept conduct must be precise and strict):\n- *降心顺道* (Subdue the heart, align with the Way) is called *戒* (precept).\n- *忍耐行持* (Patience and steadfast practice) is called *行* (conduct).\n- *一丝不杂* (Not the slightest impurity) is called *精* (refinement).\n- *一毫不犯* (No transgression, not even a hair’s breadth) is called *严* (strictness).\n- *始终不变* (Unchanging from start to finish) is called *持戒* (upholding precepts).\n- *穷困不移* (Unshaken even in hardship) is called *守戒* (defending precepts).\n\nYou who have taken the precepts—do you even remember the ten essentials of *戒*? To have the name but not the substance is meaningless! Yet there is one teaching to assure you all: *\"Hold fast to the precepts with sincerity.\"*",

I heard the judge report, 'The Heavenly Messenger has arrived—quickly prepare the incense tables to receive the edict, just as in the mortal world.' Then I saw the Heavenly Messenger, a celestial official, wearing a golden lotus crown, draped in a five-cloud crane robe, holding a yellow scroll, and entering inside. The ghosts were barred from following.*\n\n*I, too, wished to enter. A ghostly guard shouted, 'What wandering spirit are you, daring to intrude upon this solemn hall?' Another guard said, 'He looks like a monk in disguise.' The ghost replied, 'The edict clearly states that those who practiced and upheld the precepts may enter in full ceremonial attire upon death—those with radiance enter through the main gate, those with lesser light through the east gate, and those without light are stripped of their monastic name, shackled outside the western gate, and summoned for judgment by their records. But you, monk, have no radiance—just a mass of dark qi, indistinguishable from us. You presume to pass as a monk! Begone, begone!'

      "translated_text": "The monk immediately turned over, descended from the bed, and in haste cleansed his face. He took the pure flame to burn incense, seized with great terror, sorrow, and repentance, he bitterly lamented his past deeds and strictly observed the precepts.\n\nAgain, he dreamed of wandering through the **Yámù** (阎府), returning to the very place he had visited before. He saw the ghostly guards wielding iron rods and chains, rushing forward to ask, *\"What is your esteemed title, and where are you bound?\"* The monk replied, *\"I came here as a wandering ascetic, not daring to disturb the great king. I shall return immediately.\"* The guard said, *\"The great king has a rule: all ascetics of virtue and radiance who pass must first go to the tea hall, sit down, and state their name and register for inspection.\"* The monk answered, *\"I have no official business here, so I shall not stay.\"* He turned to leave, but suddenly found himself outside the realm. Upon waking, he told all this to the assembly.\n\nIn the first dream, he was beaten and scolded by the ghosts; in the second, he knelt to be questioned about his name. This was but one mind’s advance and retreat, yet it met with two different judgments. If not for his repentance and return to his former self, he would have remained as he was. **Seeing spirits as the Dao**, the principle of dark and light is one—why should one fear?\n\nAssembly, time passes swiftly, but the heart must remain radiant. Do not wait for the **impermanence** (無常) to arrive, nor act in the dark halls of the **underworld** (陰司). **Niútóu** (牛頭) offers no refuge, nor does **Màmiàn** (馬面) show mercy. If you have faults, change them swiftly; all depends on the precision of your precepts.\n\nWithin the myriad **dharma** (法) and thousand gates, cultivating the mind is the supreme path. Like an endless sea without shore or edge, follow the **precepts and wisdom** (戒慧) to attain radiance.\n\n**Seven: Enduring Insults and Subduing the Heart**\nThe greatest affliction of the cultivator, the hardest to remove and rectify, is the **anger** (嗔) within. It is not the attachment to *my* form, nor to *others’* form—when the mind of anger stirs, it is called the **fire of ignorance** (無明業火). Among the three poisons, the poison of anger ranks first. If the mind of anger is not extinguished, internally it burns oneself; if angered words are spoken, externally it burns others. It consumes the **soul’s vital gate** (靈關), reducing it to embers; it scorches the **Dharma-body** (法身), destroying it utterly. The six **organs** (六腑) cannot be cleansed, nor the five **viscera** (五臟) harmonized. When one hears insults against oneself, the fire of anger rises from the liver; when fierce winds fan the flames, the very ears that can hear are suddenly shut as if by closed windows and sealed openings. When one sees others insult oneself, the fire of anger springs from the kidneys; when fierce winds fan the flames, the very eyes that can see are suddenly obscured as if by barred doors and blocked paths. Even if the tongue does not speak angry words, the mind surges with vexation, and the gallbladder swells with malicious schemes. One fears neither the gods of heaven and earth, nor the fate of life and death; one does not dread the **oil cauldron** (油鍋) and **sword trees** (劍樹) of the underworld, nor the punishments of beheading, strangulation, or exile. Yet one turns the very tongue that can speak into a source of countless sins.\n\nWhy does this tongue, these ears, these eyes suffer such torment? It is because this **fleshly heart** (肉團心) cannot be subdued, relying on mere **vital breath and blood** (氣血) to act in arrogance and tyranny. When one later attains a tranquil mind, all becomes cold and indifferent.\n\nAssembly, the bodies of all beings in this world are but **clusters of vital breath and blood** (血氣結成). This seed of anger has been planted since the beginningless kalpas; the **fire of ignorance** (無明業火) was sown long ago. Thus, when events align with the heart’s desires, one rejoices. If they do not, one’s joy turns into resentment. When the world’s phenomena clash with the heart’s will, anger arises—this is the root of **endless rebirth** (輪迴). You have left home to seek the **extinction of birth and death** (了生死); if the root of anger persists, the **poisonous dragon** (毒龍) will invade the **heavenly root** (天根). You seek to escape the **worldly net** (世網), yet your **life-force** (性命) is heavy with causes. If this anger and hatred do not cease, it will lead to **vital breath filling the moon’s abyss** (氣填月窟). Nature is inherently good, but anger transforms it into a **poisonous dragon**; habitual anger ignites the fire that consumes the body. Life-force is inherently eternal, but anger turns it into a **fierce tiger**; constant anger breeds **poisonous vital breath**, which, when intense, extinguishes the true self.\n\nIgnorance of birth and death stems from failing to cherish one’s **life-force**; the **life-force** not being established comes from the **fire’s strength**. Thus the six **senses** (六根) cannot be restrained, the limbs tremble in vain, the five **faculties** (五官) fail to function properly, and the **fire of the pores** (毛竅) flares wildly, causing countless harms and shortening life.\n\nAssembly, to extinguish anger, first subdue the **evil thoughts**. What are **evil thoughts**? They are the inability to endure insults. The Great Sage **Confucius** (孔子) taught: *\"Be gentle and yielding in your instruction; do not repay injury with wrongdoing.\"* If the heart cannot endure, and the thought lingers even for a day, one remains a day of evil. How can an evil person enter the **Dao**?\n\nAssembly, those who cannot endure insults have hearts that cannot be subdued. They are like **poisonous dragons** and **fierce tigers**, knowing only how to insult others, never allowing themselves to be insulted. They are **overbearing**, **competitive**, and **boastful**, demanding attention before others, acting in tyranny, and speaking harshly. They **sell their heroism**, **pose as mighty warriors**, **covet gain and flaunt reputation**, **boast of their strength and oppress the weak**, **disdain the elderly and bully the young**. Though sometimes they act with **zeal for others**, they do not realize that such actions can save people as easily as they can destroy them.\n\nSince beings are deluded and do not awaken, how could they ever consider the distant consequences? The **Heavenly Path** (天道) is far-reaching; grudges and resentments never dissolve—all comes from the **unbroken root of anger**.\n\nAnger seeks only to insult others; it cannot bear to be insulted itself. One does not realize that **being insulted by others** and **insulting others** are vastly different.\n\nAssembly, the meaning of **insult** (辱) is vast. If one defiles another’s wife or concubine, one does not consider the insult to her husband, her children, her ancestors, or her entire clan. But when others defile *your* wife or concubine, anger arises, and great evil follows. One thinks: *\"How could this person defile my wife or concubine? Where is my dignity now? If others know, it is not just me who will be shamed—my parents’ and ancestors’ **virtue and merit** (功德), my children’s and descendants’ **family reputation** (門風), will all be ruined and destroyed. How can I let this pass?\"*",

      "translated_text": "The shopkeeper’s master took delight in the Dao and joyfully invited the precept-holder inside, seating him in the central hall. He bowed and offered alms, then placed a small portion of broken rice—a single *qian*—into the alms bowl. As the precept-holder prepared to leave the hall, he suddenly encountered the shopkeeper’s wife passing through the corridor. Their eyes met; she could not avoid him, and the precept-holder declined the alms and departed.\n\nThat night, while meditating, his mind wandered to the wife. He imagined her face, and in his reverie, he arose, knelt before the incense altar, confessed his transgression, and lay down again. Suddenly, he felt himself dying, reborn into the womb, growing into a man who took a wife—fair of face, harmonious in union. Walking along the road, he saw a Daoist begging for alms, and his heart rejoiced. He brought the Daoist home, offered alms as merit, and called his wife to meet him, bowing in submission.\n\nTurning, he saw the Daoist gesture toward his wife, and his anger flared instantly. He rushed into the kitchen, seized a cleaver, and lunged to strike the Daoist. His foot caught, he stumbled awake—seething with rage—only to realize it was a dream, his body drenched in sweat. Reflecting on the Daoist’s face, it was the rice-shop owner who had given alms; the wife was the one he had encountered in the corridor.\n\n**Assembly**, this precept-holder, though newly practicing, had firm precepts but unstable concentration. Thus, day and night his thoughts wandered, and delusive visions arose, deepening into dreamlike illusions.\n\nAnother practitioner, steadfast in precepts, had never spoken falsely, nor let his mind stray. Though insulted, he harbored no resentment; though struck, he did not retaliate; though reviled, he offered no reply. He only reflected on his own faults, never blaming others. One day, carrying a burden along the road, he encountered a galloping donkey. He stepped aside, but the donkey reared, striking him with its head. He could not evade it and fell to the ground. The donkey bit his clothes, tearing them before trotting away.\n\nThat night, as he meditated, his mind grew hazy. Suddenly, a white-clad figure appeared, bowing and saying, *“I am the donkey that struck you on the road. In a past life, we had unresolved karmic debt. Now that debt is released, and we are both freed from suffering. From this life onward, we shall be reborn among humans. I come to tell you: on the *such-and-such* day of the next month, meet me at *such-and-such* place to aid your liberation.”* With these words, the figure vanished.\n\nThe practitioner saw and heard this clearly—neither dream nor waking—then resumed his meditation as usual. On the appointed day of the following month, he went to the place. The household was filled with joy, as if celebrating good fortune. Asking others, he learned that the family had given birth to a child that night. The practitioner was struck with terror, memorized the name, and vowed to first liberate himself before aiding others.\n\n**Assembly**, if you harbor such karmic roots, they will manifest in this life. **Precept-holders**, you must resolve to endure insults, release grudges, bear suffering, forget shame, and suffer loss. You must subdue this mind, accept all afflictions, and wield the *jie dao* [precept-knife] to slay the fire of ignorance at every moment. Clothe yourself in the robe of forbearance, enduring beatings and curses, slander and humiliation, without breaking your precepts even for an instant.\n\nEven when falsely accused, dragged before magistrates, struck by lightning, burned by fire, drowned, robbed, mauled by beasts, bitten by serpents, oppressed by demons, or tormented by spirits—when your reputation is ruined, your kin harmed, or your limbs severed—you cannot escape the retribution of past deeds. The suffering is fated; the debt must be repaid.\n\nDo not resist what is inevitable—it would only harm your precepts. Instead, recall: *Those who wrong me have once been wronged by me. Those who oppress me have once been oppressed by me.* All misfortune—magical, karmic, or otherwise—is self-made, the fruit of past actions. From this day forward, as you uphold the precepts, let all evil deeds dissolve with your mind. Naturally, the six desires will fade, the three poisons vanish, and your body and mind will grow light and serene. Suffering will heal, and grudges will dissolve.\n\n**Assembly**, from the beginningless accumulation of grudges, today you must awaken to your true nature. For every debt, every wrong, vow to endure and repay—harming yourself to benefit others—only then will you attain liberation. Thereafter, you will return to pristine purity, the original unity of the cosmos, preserving the spirit in stillness, refining the perfect retribution-body.\n\nIf you refuse to repay past debts, refuse to surrender present shame, then future retribution will not spare you. How then can this body transcend? How can this mind attain emptiness? How can the Dao be cultivated?\n\nYou cannot even endure a few harsh words now—how can you hope to escape birth and death entirely?\n\n**Assembly**, forbearance extinguishes the fire of ignorance, and the five viscera grow cool. Forbearance brings forth the waters of *Huachi* [the elixir field], and the six bowels harmonize. Forbearance satisfies others’ desires, and grudges dissolve in peace. Forbearance expands your capacity, and your chest grows vast.\n\nIn truth, those who insult you do not truly insult you—only you bear the burden of their karma.",

not bound by form,\nRight before your eyes lies the Great Sage of the Luo.\"*\n\nThus, this body is no small source of woe.\n\nNow, you must see through the skin-bag as a borrowed thing,\nA concoction of earth, water, and wind.\n\nIf you do not pursue purification to its utmost,\nAnd merely urge people to practice filial piety,\nSaying that the body and hair are received from parents,\nAnd must not be harmed—\n\nParental essence and maternal blood,\nCombined in the Five Agents,\nBear the refined *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd obtain the divine power of *yin* and *yang*.\n\nThe head, round as Heaven,\nThe feet, square as Earth—\nPlaced between Heaven and Earth,\nShared among the Three Talents,\nAmong all things, humans are first.\n\nAbove, we can pair with Heaven and Earth,\nBelow, we can honor the spirits and *devas*.\nIn learning, we can aspire to the sages,\nIn cultivation, we can become *immortals*, Buddhas.\n\nHow can we regard this most noble, rich body\nAs a foul, worthless clod of earth?\n\nOnly those who embrace the *Precepts*,\nWho refuse to sink into decline,\nWho are not entangled by worldly waves—\n\nWho do not seek bodily comfort,\nBut return their true *nature* to its true constant—\n\nWho wish to govern *yin* and *yang* with their will and *qi*,\nWho wish to adorn the *Dharma-realm* with their form and spirit—\n\nIf even the *Dharma-body* is flawed,\nThen form and spirit cannot both be wondrous,\nAnd the *Way* cannot be truly united.\n\n**Assembled ones**, I now explain the practice of purification to you.\nIf you wish this body to be pure,\nFirst cast aside worldly attachments,\nSever dusty emotions,\nAnd differ entirely from worldly *dharma*.\n\nEmbrace simplicity and take joy in quietude,\nAbandon richness and leave behind clamor.\n\nTake refuge in the Three Treasures,\nAnd steadfastly uphold the One Truth.\n\nNurture your *nature* and emotions to be serene and balanced,\nKeep your hands and feet dignified and composed—\nYour eyes and ears must not stray to evil,\nYour thoughts must not be scattered and chaotic,\nYour mind must not dwell on contrivance or fixation,\nYour speech must not be loud or boastful.\n\nRetract the divine light of your two eyes,\nTo illuminate within and never dim the sacred *platform* (灵台);\n\nReturn the refined essence of your two ears,\nTo listen inwardly and always hear the Celestial Resonance.\n\nSparingly speak, often silent,\nAnd return to the natural, unshaken stillness.\n\nRegret none, wander in thought no more,\nYour spirit unperturbed, the Heavenly Mechanism clear—\nThe profound *principles* complete and unobstructed.\n\nCease consuming meat and blood,\nTo secretly dissolve the karmic retribution of countless lives.\n\nFollow the *Precepts* in body,\nAnd solemnly uphold the majesty of the Four Great Elements.\n\nIf your steps are not disorderly, your mind will not be agitated,\nIf your hands do not move recklessly, your mind will not be restless.\n\nSit upright and centered, never allowing crookedness,\nLie alert and aware, guarding against excessive slumber—\nEat simple and bland foods to reduce flavors,\nAnd let the Five *Zang* Organs remain tranquil and peaceful.\n\nSpeak with caution and composure,\nAnd let your voice be harmonious and resonant.\n\nThis is called the *coarse practice* of purifying the body.\n\nAs for the subtle methods,\nThey require you to ponder the two words—*pure* and *still*—\nLest you fail to penetrate them into your heart,\nAnd instead lament that you cannot achieve the *Way*,\nThough you diligently study and practice.\n\n**Assembled ones**, a mind without dual thoughts is *pure*,\nA thought without obstruction is *still*.\n\nThe mind not clinging to forms is *pure*,\nA thought not stopping is *still*.\n\nThoughts clear and complete are *pure*,\nLight unobstructed is *still*.\n\nNot a speck of defilement is *pure*,\nAll considerations emptied are *still*.\n\nAll things cannot hide their forms from you—*pure*,\nSpirits cannot fathom your workings—*still*.\n\nThe mind like flowing water is *pure*,\nThe *nature* like bright moon is *still*.\n\nSince beginningless time, all guilt destroyed—*pure*,\nAll causes from countless eons utterly clear—*still*.\n\nObserving your mind, yet no mind is seen—*pure*,\nGazing at all things, yet no things are seen—*still*.\n\nWhen these three insights are awakened—*pure*,\nOnly seeing emptiness—*still*.\n\nSeeing emptiness, yet emptiness itself is seen—*pure*,\nEmptiness possessing nothing to be emptied—*still*.\n\nWhat is emptied has no existence,\nWithout existence, there is no \"without\"—*pure*,\nEver-pervasive stillness—*still*,\nStillness possessing nothing to be still—*still*.\n\nThe true constant responds to all things—*pure*,\nThe constant response is

(*Liu Gen* / Six Roots) you possess all have true teachers.\nFor instance, if your ears hear virtuous words (*Shan Yan*),\nand you truly follow them with conviction (*Shan Shuo*),\nthis sense of hearing (*Er Gen* / Ear Root)\nis your guiding teacher,\nand these virtuous words are the transmitting teacher.\nThe same applies to the other five senses.\n\nAssembly,\nthere is no fixed teacher in learning (*Xue Wu*),\nonly the Dao is the teacher.\nWhenever your ears hear good words and virtuous speech,\nyou must focus your spirit and listen in silence—\nas if sweet dew were dripping into your heart,\nor if clear wisdom (*Xing Ke* / Awakening Mind) were poured upon your crown—\nconcentrate your mind and silently absorb this person,\nwho opens my stupidity and ignorance (*Yu Mei*),\nwho acts with compassion and skillful means (*Ci Bei Fang Bian*),\nwishing this person who proclaims virtuous words\nto quickly attain profound merit (*Xuan Gong*),\nto obtain the unsurpassed Dao (*Wu Shang Dao*),\nis this not teacher and disciple?\n\nIf your eyes see all the sutras (*Jing Dian*),\nthe scriptures of the Three Teachings (*San Jiao*),\ntrue words and secret keys (*Zhen Yan Mi Jue*),\nand you attain awakening through them,\nthen you should pay homage and praise them—\nsuch texts are your true recognition and utmost faith.\nNaturally, teacher and disciple will meet.\n\nYet the teacher’s compassionate boat of the law (*Ci Hang Fa Qiao*),\nthe bridge of instruction,\nis not a single method.\nMencius said:\n“Teaching methods are many indeed.\nThere are those who perfect virtue (*Cheng De*),\nthose who cultivate talent (*Da Cai*),\nthose who answer questions (*Da Wen*),\nand those who privately emulate and learn (*Si Shu Ai*),\nthese are all methods of teaching and instruction.”\n\nThus, there are those who bow their heads and rejoice in meeting (*Qing Gai*),\nwho immediately align upon seeing;\nthere are those who humbly confess their ignorance (*Zi Shou Ru Xin*),\nwho do not presume superiority over others;\nthere are those who kowtow and bend the knee in transmission (*Qi Shou Qu Xi*),\nthere are those who make solemn vows and pledges before transmission (*Zhai Jin Meng Shi*),\nwho then receive the teaching.\n\nReverence is the incomplete form of respect (*Li* / Rites).\nReverence without sincerity is not true reverence.\nWhat matters is observing the disciple’s sincerity and steadfast practice (*Cheng Xin Du Xing*),\nrespecting the teacher and honoring the Dao.\n\nThus, there are those who test repeatedly before transmission—\nlike the ten trials of *Dong Bin* (the Immortal) in *Yun Fang* (the Cloud Room).\nThere are those who humble themselves before being seen—\nlike *Liu Xuan De* (Lord Liu) of the Three Visits to *Mao Lu* (the thatched hut).\nSome have followed their teachers for years,\nyet their hearts do not turn toward the Dao (*Xin Bu Tui Zhuan*).\nSome know the truth of sincerity,\nyet deliberately test with many hardships (*Gu Shi Duo Jian*).\n\nThis transmission of the Dao and reception of its teachings (*Shou Ye*),\nis it not something of great significance,\nnot something easily obtained?\n\nThus, there are those who speak not with three mouths,\nwho transmit not with six ears (*San Kou Bu Yan, Liu Er Bu Chuan*).\nThe highest teachings (*Shang Cheng Dao Fa*)\ncannot be transmitted to the middle and low;\nthe middle and low teachings (*Zhong Xia Dao Fa*)\ncannot be transmitted to the superior in wisdom (*Shang Zhi*).\n\nOnly does one teach according to the person (*Yin Ren Er Jiao*).\nAs when *Ran You* asked about *Wen Si Xing Zhi* (the method of hearing and practicing),\nthe Master said:\n“Hear and practice.”\nWhen *Zi Lu* asked about *Wen Si Xing Zhi*,\nthe Master said:\n“With parents and elder brothers present,\nhow could you hear and practice?”\n\nFor *Ran You* was humble (*Qiu Ye Tui*),\nso he was advanced (*Jin Zhi*),\nwhile *Zi Lu* was of mediocre talent (*You Ye Jian Ren*),\nso he was held back (*Tui Zhi*).\nThis is why they could not both hear the same teachings.\n\nThus, *Gong Xi Hua* (Zigong) heard it twice,\nand yet still fell into doubt and confusion (*Sheng Yi Huo*).」",

      "translated_text": "The Master and his disciples asked about *ren* (benevolence/virtue) in great numbers, yet the Master’s responses varied—this is so.\n\nSome may take it with sincere faith, while others hear it casually; those with faith may be spoken to, while the casual hearers may not.\n\nThus it is said: *“Do not dismiss it as trivial just because it is easily obtained.”*\n\nTo the assembly: some may transmit the Dao among thousands, yet the wise among them grasp it easily, while the dull find it hard to practice. If one shouts aloud, revealing the profound mysteries, those who listen with intent may record it, but those who lack the right connection hear it as mere words, carried away like wind through the ear.\n\nTo the assembly: the Buddha Śākyamuni raised his flower and showed it to all, saying: *“I possess the wondrous bright true-nature, the nirvāṇa-mind, the true Dharma-eye treasure—can all of you see and attain it?”* Only Mahākāśyapa smiled in response.\n\nTo the assembly: Mahākāśyapa, the Śākyan, openly cultivated the *Zhàn Dào* (the high road) while secretly crossing the *Chén Cāng* (the hidden pass). Before the great assembly, he transmitted the secret Dao in private, mind-to-mind, mouth-to-mouth. Yet those seated below remained unaware of what was transmitted or received.\n\nAgain, like the Sage Confucius before the assembly of sages and worthy disciples, he said to Zēngzi: *“Shēn, my Dao is one thread running through all.”* Zēngzi replied: *“Yes.”* At that time, his disciples were many—was this not the Sage transmitting the Dao before the disciples, while Zēngzi passed it on within the gathered disciples?\n\nOrdinary people do not recognize their own true-nature, so they meet it yet fail to meet it, unaware of what is transmitted or passed on.\n\nBut Zēngzi deeply understood his own nature, naturally aligning with the Sage’s intent.\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor, Xuānyuán, sought the Dao in the Kūndūn Mountains from Guāngchéngzi. He repeatedly urged his request, but Guāngchéngzi gave no answer. The Yellow Emperor withdrew to fast and meditate, dwelling in seclusion for three months, then returned, bowing humbly, advancing on his knees, and asked for the essence of the supreme Dao. Guāngchéngzi then replied:\n\n*“The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and dark;\nits utmost reaches are dim and silent.\nSee nothing, hear nothing—embrace the Spirit in stillness,\nand the form will naturally align.\nBe utterly still, be utterly clear—\ndo not weary your body,\ndo not let your thoughts flutter ceaselessly,\nthen you may attain longevity.\nGuard your exterior, close your interior—\nexcessive cleverness brings ruin.\nI hold to its One and dwell in its harmony,\nthus I have not aged for twelve hundred years.”*\n\nThese few words were spoken directly to the Yellow Emperor, yet he said no more.\n\nFollow them if you will—it is your choice.\nDo not follow them if you will—it is also your choice.",

      "translated_text": "「When scorching heat and dampness give way to cold winds,\nThe six pulses of yin and yang fall into disarray.\n\nChasing steeds and hunting game, the three souls scatter and flee—\nA thousand maladies assail, aging, sickness, and woe;\nA thousand calamities cling, weariness and exhaustion evermore.\n\nTaking *shēn* and *líng* in vain, they cry to heaven and earth but find no response—\nA thousand agonies defy utterance,\nTill one day the breath is cut, and they descend to the netherworld.\n\nStately in bearing, yet before the body cools, men turn away in disgust;\nAwe-inspiring in presence, yet once the eyes close, the face is turned to the sky.\n\nFour limbs bound in wood, a single corpse reduced to paper—\nNo sons to avenge, no consorts to follow.\n\nWhile the corpse yet lies cold, the living already plot—\nBrothers divide wealth and seize estates,\nWives and concubines hoard treasures for their own security.\n\nThose with children ponder how to live better;\nThose without sons scheme to remarry.\n\nGuests and carriages grow scarce at the door,\nAs the saying goes: *\"A man lives by his connections.\"*\n\nServants within steal and plunder,\nYet dare not speak, for *\"the fallen are preyed upon by their own.\"*\n\nWhen walls crumble and furniture is scattered, who cares?\nWhen fortunes fade, who knows?\n\nWanton wives and unworthy sons,\nEach attend to their own futures.\n\nWho has ever died and lived again?\nWho has ever gone and returned?\n\nBorn with empty hands, they die with nothing—\nThe mortal form returns to dust, the name vanishes into emptiness;\nThe paths of virtue and vice are clear, and retribution is manifest.\n\nBehold, this mortal guise—a phantom of illusion—\nIs it not all false?\n\nYet in their pursuit of wealth, noble rank,\nWives and concubines, grandchildren, honor and riches,\nNot a shred of true spirit remains—\nThis is no falsehood.\n\nWhere has this true spirit gone?\nPlainly, it is in the afterlife.\n\nIf it is plainly there, why cling to wives and children,\nTo riches and honor?\n\nThis is the dual path of virtue and vice—\nGuilt and reward, suffering and joy—\nAs real as shadow clinging to form.\n\nThe mortal body endures suffering and punishment—\nHow could there be the slightest escape?\n\nThus, you must regard the mortal form as light,\nThe *dharma-body* as heavy,\nUse the false to cultivate the true,\nPreserve the true and abandon the false,\nTo seek liberation from the sea of woe.\n\nYet without this mortal form,\nThere is no means to practice—\nThen the single spark of the *dharma-body*\nCannot act on its own,\nAnd falls back into the six realms of rebirth—\nThis would be labor in vain.\n\nSince we have attained human birth,\nEntered the Dao,\nWe must escape the cycle of rebirth—\nWhile sight and vigor remain,\nDiligently cultivate the true.\n\nHow does one cultivate?\nBy purifying the six senses’ gates of dust,\nHarmonizing the five *zàng* organs and five *qì*—\nThe true self abides in the *lingtái*,\nUnassailable by demons—\nPerforming countless good deeds,\nAnd uprooting the roots of sin.\n\nYet within this cultivation of the true,\nThere are two paths—\nSome true, some false,\nSome with effort, some without.\nThe *Vajra Sutra* says:\n*\"All conditioned things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows,\nLike dew, like lightning—thus they are.\"*\n\nThe *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* says:\n*\"Why do beings not attain the true Dao?\nFor they have deluded minds.\"*\n\nWhat these two scriptures teach\nReveals that conditioned practices are not the way.\n\nThere is one school that claims to *\"transfer essence and vitalize qi*,\nTo *\"merge life and prolong vitality*,\nTo *\"reverse aging and restore youth*,\nTo *\"achieve eternal life*—\nAll through clinging to form.\n\nAnd another that speaks of *\"raising lead and lowering mercury*,\nOf *\"forging the cauldron and burning the thatch*,\nOf *\"ingesting elixirs of immortality*,\nOf *\"swallowing talismans and feasting on vital qi*—\nThese too are *\"cultivating the true through the false*,\nAll manner of conditioned, deceptive practices—\nHow could they reveal nature and establish life,\nTo escape the cycle of rebirth?\n\nTo transcend birth and death,\nIt is not this way one emerges.\n\nCultivating the true through the false,\nOne must examine the great matter of life and death—\nTruly understand the path of the Dao.\n\nWhat is this path?\nIt lies in the harmony or discord of your single mind.\n\nIf in harmony, it follows its course;\nIf in discord, it answers to you.\n\nThe mortal body must die—\nWhether cultivated or not, it dies.\nEven if they live a thousand years,\nThey still return to dust—\nSo why the struggle?\n\nThe form has birth, it must decay;\nIt has a beginning, it must end;\nIt is shaped, it must dissolve;\nIt is gathered, it must disperse;\nIt comes, it must go;\nIt succeeds, it must fail;\nIt thrives, it must age.\n\nSince the body is born,\nIt must die.\n\nThe cultivation of transcending birth and death\nI speak of does not concern this body—\nIt merely uses it as a dwelling place,\nTo cultivate the *dharma-body* of heaven’s command.\n\nExternal teachings do not grasp this truth,\nAnd thus take the true as false,\nClinging to form—\nThey seek to preserve this blood-flesh body,\nTo make it unbreakable and undying—\nIs this not laughable?\n\nThe cultivation of transcending birth and death\nI speak of lies solely within this body’s true mind—\nIn the thoughts that move it,\nIn the deeds it performs.\n\nWhen deluded thoughts cease,\nThe *dharma-body* is born;\nWhen the *dharma-body* is still,\nHeaven’s mechanism stirs;\nWhen heaven’s mechanism moves,\nThe true light appears.\n\nIt is this true light that cannot be fully realized,\nThus, through this mortal form, we perform good deeds.\n\nYet good deeds too have true and false—\nClinging to form is false;\nNot clinging to form is true.\n\nObserve the Thus-Come-One—\nHe gives without clinging to form,\nHe performs merit without clinging to form,\nHe teaches without clinging to form,\nHe cultivates without clinging to form.\nHe emerges from the world without clinging to form—\nThus he can emerge from the world.\nBecause he can emerge from the world,\nHe can transcend birth and death.\n\nThe *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* says:\n*\"The highest virtue is non-virtue.\"*\nThis means non-attachment—\nOnly thus is liberation possible.\nHow then can one transcend birth and death?」",

you:\nyou should revise the vow you took last year.\nI, at that time, vowed to **cultivate the Way**,\nto **confess and purge** my **karmic offenses**,\nand seek **deliverance**.\nYet when my **earthly life** was exhausted,\nat the **Third Heaven’s gate**,\nI was summoned before the **celestial officials**,\nwho loudly proclaimed:\n*'This person’s **karmic roots** remain—\nthey cannot escape their **kalpa**,*\n*their name is absent from the **Heavenly Register**,\n*their place is none on the **Elixir Peaks**—\n*they may not advance further,\n*but shall be appointed to the **Threefold Council** of **Yuntai Mountain**,\n*the **Capital of the Three Elements**.'*\n\n*Immediately, the **mighty winds** and **fierce qi***\n*sealed the **Heavenly Gate**,\nand I saw no way forward.\nMy body was sent to the **Threefold Council**,\nwhere I met the **Three Officials of the Netherworld**.\nThey examined my **karmic ledger**,\nand declared:\n*'You are of the **lower vehicle**, a **petty resolve** from a **side path**—\n*you dare to **transcend**?\n*Today, we spare you for your **ignorance on the wrong path**,\n*as the **mountain god of Tiantai and Tongbo** lacks a **post**,\n*so you shall temporarily **administer their duties**,\n*and when a **vacancy arises in the Netherworld**,\n*you will be **officially appointed**.'*\n\n*I then pleaded for instruction,\nso I might **cultivate in the underworld**,\nand the **Three Officials**, in their **merciful countenance**, commanded:\n*'When you sat on the **cushion** in meditation,\nyour **intent was not pure**,\nyour **mind was not empty**—\nyou had not **penetrated** the **truth that the colored body is empty**,\nthat **inherent nature is real**,\nnor had you **awakened** to the **non-emptiness within emptiness**.\nYou only knew that **karmic debts of a thousand lives** must be **confessed and purged**,\nthat **ancestral grudges of generations** must be **erased**,\nand that after **leaving home**,\nno **karmic debts or offenses** would arise again.\nYet you never **deeply investigated** or **fully awakened**—\nhow could **grudges and grudges** be **erased** from **inherent nature**,\nor **karmic offenses** be **confessed and purged**?\n\n*Who says that the **karmic roots** you have accumulated through kalpas,*\n*the **grudges** you have created in lifetimes past,*\n*can be **cleared** by a mere **utterance** or **thought**,\n*so that **karmic retribution** may vanish like **dust in the wind**?\n\n*You must first **enter the path** and **establish resolve**,\n*learn the **highest vehicle** and **great karmic roots**,\n*and take **universal salvation** as your aspiration.\nFor the **great vehicle of the highest path**,\nthe **common mind is instantly extinguished**,\nand **Heaven and Earth become empty**,\n**illusory forms** reduced to **ashes**—\nthen **self and others are one**,\nand only **ancestral karmic debts** and **deep-seated grudges** remain,\n**unable to be resolved**,\n**owing wealth and life**—\nhow can they be **dismissed lightly**?\n\n*Thus, the **Ancient Buddhas**, like **Ārya Rāja**,*\n*severed limbs to **repay past offenses**,\n*not omitting even a hair’s breadth,*\n*and only then **attained** the **Buddha Śākyamuni**.\n*The Sixth Patriarch*\n**washed away ancestral grudges**,\n**received even the subtlest karmic debts**,\nand only then **attained** the **Great Mirror of the Western Heaven**.\n\n*Yet you, with **petty resolve** and **weak roots**,\nrefuse to **repay karmic debts**,\nonly seeking to **escape suffering**—\nyou cling too firmly to the **colored body’s reality**,\nfearing **retributive encounters**,\n**punishment**, **beating**, **execution**, or **pain**,\nand your **one thought** is to keep the **colored body** ever **comfortable**.\nThis **fear of repayment for private gain** is your **weak root**,\nand it marks you as of the **lower vehicle**.\n\n*So long as **karmic roots** are not **empty**,\nthey will **rearise in future kalpas**,\nand **offenses remain**—\nin **later lives**, you will **encounter them again**.\nYou call yourself **one who has left home**,\nbut in truth, you are **fleeing suffering**.\nUnable to **escape suffering**,\nyou will be **entangled by kalpas**,\n**grudges extending through generations**—\nall because your **initial vow was weak**,\nand your **aspiration too narrow**.\n\n*This life, you have only **left home in name**,\n**cultivating merit** but not the **Dao**.\nYou should **enter the wheel of rebirth**,\n**transmigrate** to **reap merit**.\nYet because you once **recited** the **Supreme Emperor’s Scripture** (*Huangdi Fabao*) for a hundred volumes,\nand **chanted** the **Miracles of Amitābha’s Name** (*Mile Baohao*) for three years,\nwith **sincere and ardent devotion**,\nyou were **enrolled** as a **Zhengyi True Person**,\nand **deserve** the **rank of Netherworld Official**.\nNow, as you remain in the world,\n**acting as a sponsor** for scripture recitations,\nyou have not **failed** in your **karmic duties**.\nAs for **receiving wealth** from others,\nyou

disciples of the Dao/Way’s sublime transformation,\nmy children of the宗宗 *wind* and宗宗 *virtue/power*,\nmy young souls continuing the Dao/Way’s lineage,\nmy adepts breaking the celestial barriers—\n\nAcross the ten *zhou* and three *dao* islands,\nall have heard, all have known.\nEach must ponder deeply—\nprepare swiftly, for a determined vow is your greatest gain.\n\n*Ah!* If this body does not attain liberation in this very life,\nthen in what future life shall it be freed?\n\nTime flies like an arrow, the sun and moon like a shuttle—\nfrom your ordination till now,\nyou have wasted years, squandered days,\nyour hair like frost, your skin wrinkled with lines,\nyour teeth falling out, your sinews stiff and skin slackened.\n\n*Alas!* When bones grow soft,\nyou cannot journey far;\nwhen blood is drained,\nyour strength cannot bear weight.\n\nWhen essence is exhausted and kidneys decay,\nyour eyes grow dim and blurred;\nwhen spirit flags and mind goes wild,\nyour soul is restless and unmoored.\nWhen vital breath fades yet the corpse remains,\nyour ears droop in feeble hearing;\nwhen stomach is strong yet spleen is weak,\nyour appetite wanes and fails.\n\nAssembled ones, know this body is but an illusion—\nno matter how firm, death’s day is certain,\nonly differing in early or late arrival.\n\nLike this: deaf ears, blind eyes, parched tongue,\nfalling teeth, trembling gums,\naching waist, hunched back,\nsnow-white hair, scorched brows—\nwhen sinews grow rigid, limbs numb,\nwhen resolve weakens and heart grows cold,\nthese are the summons from the Lord of Death,\nawaiting your arrival.\n\nDo not cling to the petty heart of a housewife,\nthe shallow mind of a bean-curd merchant,\nthe narrow vision of a dwarf,\nthe deluded stupor of a beast—\nonly fixated on the present,\nheedless of the life to come.\n\nIf now the ghosts should summon you,\nand you refuse to endure,\nyou must go—\nhow then can you be called a Daoist,\none who has renounced the world?\nCan you escape, can you evade?\n\nWhy not look deeply, seek liberation early?\n\nTo act with decisive resolve,\nto let go with a single step—\nthis is the mark of a true *dàzhàngfū* (great man),\na singular *qí nánzǐ* (extraordinary man).\n\nResolute spirit, with skillful means,\nto ordain and practice the Dao/Way.\nOtherwise, you are but a cowardly mind,\na flaccid visage.\n\nThe four *great elements*—wind, fire, earth, water—\neach now in their own relentless course.\nThe lifetime’s clarity of sight and hearing—\nall dispersed among the masses.\n\nMurmuring, drifting, swaying, sinking—\ninto the depths of hell you go.\n\n*Ah!* Assembled ones, without resolve in practice,\nyou are but puppets in a play—\nwhen the drums and gongs cease,\nwhere shall you go?\n\nOnly with resolve can you transcend the world;\nwithout it, a thousandfold difficulty.\n\nTo establish resolve in cultivating the Dao/Way of true spontaneity,\nwhereby great *virtue/power* and spirit are not trifled—\n\nThe fourteen *yìn* (seals) verify its efficacy.\nChildren of the Dao, if you seek the wondrous Dao/Way of\n*qīngjìng* (serene stillness) and *wúwéi* (non-action),\nyou must have resolve—\nto be truly free.\n\nIf you can walk in freedom,\nthen the Dao/Way’s natural order is within you.\nIf you cannot walk in freedom,\nhow can you be free?\nIf you cannot even master worldly affairs,\nhow can you attain freedom?\n\nThe *xian* masters say:\n*\"To cultivate the Dao/Way of immortality,\nfirst cultivate the Dao/Way of humanity.\nIf the Dao/Way of humanity is unmastered,\nthe Dao/Way of immortality is distant indeed.\"*\n\nThe Confucian schools teach:\n*\"First bring order to your family,\nthen you may govern the state.\"*\n\nOrdering your family is like mastering the Dao/Way of humanity,\ngoverning the state is like cultivating the Dao/Way of immortality.\nIf you cannot order your family,\nhow can you govern the state?\n\nThe Buddhist *shì* (teachings) declare:\n*\"You must exhaust the mind of the mundane,\nelse there is no awakening to the sacred.\"*\n\nThis mundane mind holds the *sāṃghī* (threefold discipline) of\n*three bonds* and *five constants*—\nif you follow it to completion,\nthe Dao/Way of humanity is fulfilled,\nand the Dao/Way of immortality is no longer difficult.\n\nThough you may not become a sage, a true Daoist, or a Buddha,\nit is still easy enough.\n\nHow then should you advance in the Dao/Way of immortality?\nChildren of the Dao, from your entry into the *xuánmén* (mysterious gate),\nstudying to be Daoists,\nbowing to masters and receiving their precepts—\nyou then sit in meditation, quieting your mind,\nbelieving the Dao/Way of mundane humanity is exhausted,\nthat the Dao/Way of immortality is soon to come.\n\nYet you have not exhausted your heart’s reverence for your master,\nnor can you distinguish the transmitted *kōujué* (oral precepts)\nfrom their opposites—\nand you dare to act without foundation.\n\nNo sooner have you begun\nthan you seek its verification.\nAfter three days or two,\nseeing no signs of progress,\nyou abandon it.\n\nYou then seek another master,\nreceive two phrases of instruction,\nand sit again.\nThis fleeting impulse toward the Dao/Way\nlasts no more than two or three days,\nthen you seek verification once more—\nyour very thoughts cannot be steadied.\n\nSuch is the confusion of your mind, the shallowness of your wisdom—\nin vain do you practice a thin veneer of cultivation,\nendlessly pondering,\nyour spirit unable to settle,\nyour efforts but a dream.\n\nAfter twenty or thirty years of sitting,\nyou remain but a mundane mortal—\nand at death, you still do not know it.\n\nWhat a pity—\ntime wasted like water beneath a moon’s reflection,\ngrasping at flowers in a mirror,\nthinking it easy, yet never attaining.\n\nThere are no shortcuts to the Dao/Way of immortality.\n\nPitiful are those who follow blind masters,\nwho are deceived by external *dào* (teachings).\nI will not speak further.\n\nOnly I urge you:\nTake the chapter of *precise discipline and conduct* as your foundation,\nestablish resolve in repaying kindness,\nand repeatedly reflect on these matters.\nFirst purify your thoughts,\nremove the afflictions of *mùmíng* (deluded ignorance).\n\nWith a single mind toward the Dao/Way,\ntake refuge in the *sāṃbhoga* (Three Treasures),\nrecite the true *sūtra* (scriptures),\nfollow the *lǜ* (precepts) in practice—\nsit for a hundred days in the *shí fāng táng* (ten-direction halls),\nyour outward demeanor dignified,\nyour corporeal form stable,\nall affairs in order,\nyour body upright and composed.\n\nThen perform the rites of respectful homage,\ninvite the true *shìzhēn* (authentic teacher),\nand vow not to study the *zhōng xià èr shèng* (middle and lower two vehicles).\nWith resolute heart, you pledge:\n*\"I wish to hear the Dao/Way of supreme,\nnatural liberation—\nthe serene stillness of the unexcelled *dà shèng* (great vehicle),\nwhereby I may comprehend birth and death,\nand forever escape the wheel of *lúnhuí* (reincarnation).\"\nOnly then may you receive the *shíyìn*

My children, why do you cling to other teachings?\n\nI fear you do not recognize this *huiming*—it is the **Soul-Treasure** (*lingbao*). Deeply knowing you, at every turn you resist it—you are not those who have seen their true nature (*jianxing*) or grasped the intent (*zhi yi*) of the Dao.\n\nEven if you see it, you do not use it.\nWhen you do use it, you cannot wield it fully.\nWhen this spark of *huiming* departs,\nit is as if **Yuan Shi Tian Zun** leaves his seat of law,\n**Huangdi** loses his **Mysterious Pearl** (*xuanzhu*),\n**Tie Lao** abandons his staff,\nand **Zhang Guo** discards his **Green Donkey** (*qinglü*).\nUnable to speak, yet groping at empty nostrils;\nhaving a heart yet no aperture—\nhow could you be so dull and murky?\nNow, with this **Sacred Heart** of the *Taoist* scriptures,\nI uphold the **Great Virtue** of the **Ancestral Sage** (*qiu zu*) in cherishing life,\nurging you to awaken and seek\nthe wondrous principle of preserving life and extending existence.\n\nHave you not heard the *Sutra of the Supreme Dao of Mysterious and Numinous Treasures for Dispelling Calamities and Protecting Life*?\n\nIf you can truly comprehend this sutra,\nyou will be able to perpetuate your *huiming* endlessly—\neverlasting, never ceasing.\n\nIf you merely chant the name aloud,\nthat is but **offering**—not true comprehension.\nThose who merely offer,\nchant as they may, will depart as they began—\nthey cannot savor its depth.\n\nThe sutra does not say:\n*\"You beings, from beginningless time,\nyour mind is enslaved by form,\nyour thoughts follow the shifting of objects.\nOnly when lost in love and infatuation,\ndo you tirelessly drift in the river of desire,\ndrown in the ocean of craving,\ncling to illusory shapes and images,\nand lose sight of your original nature.\n\nThe Dao is formless—yet you grasp it as form;\nThe Dao is not empty—yet you cling to it as emptiness.\nConfused by the duality of emptiness and form,\nyou invert existence and nonexistence,\nand ultimately cannot clarify your own self.\nHow could you escape the path of birth and death,\nor leap beyond the cycle of transmigration?\n\nIf one knows emptiness is not empty,\nknows form is not form,\ndoes not cling to the perception of emptiness,\nand transcends all doubts and defilements,\nthen they can purify the Six Senses,\nand sever all obstacles.\n\nThis is the **core principle** of our school,\nwhich I now proclaim to you—\nthe sutra is named:\n*Protecting Life to Attain the Dao*,\n*Universal Salvation of Beings*,\n*Teaching the World*,\n*Circulating for Recitation*.\nThose who recite and transmit it\nwill be guarded by **Flying Heavenly Kings**,\n**Vajra-Destroyers of Demons**,\n**Numinous Treasure Children** who protect the law,\n**True Persons** who rescue suffering,\nand **Golden-Eyed Ferocious Beasts**—\neach with ten million hosts to shield this sutra,\nso that all beings may escape these defilements.\"*\n\n**Assemblage!** (*Dazhong ya!*)\nThe **form-body** (*se shen*) could never know emptiness is not empty,\nknow form is not form,\ndiscern the **formless law** (*wu kong fa*),\nor **penetrate** (*dòng guān*) the **unobstructed** (*wu ài*).\nHow could it enter the **gates of myriad wonders**?\n\nThus, I first clarify the sutra’s profound truths\nto safeguard your *huiming*—your vital spark.\n\nThe **Ancestral Sage’s** compassion fears\nyou mistake the **form-body** for your true self.\nHe urges you to be:\n**without trace in the without** (*wu zhong wu*),\n**form within form** (*se zhong se*),\n**having within the having** (*you zhong you*),\n**emptiness within emptiness** (*kong zhong kong*),\nso that this illusory flesh does not summon or manipulate you—\nso that you are not lost in its endless clamor,\nbewildered by the true **school** (*zong*), and forfeit the **Soul-Treasure**.\n\nThus, this sutra commands you\nto protect your **numinous root** (*ling gen*),\nand **nurture your primal essence** (*zhuang yuan ben*).\nWhen the root is steadfast, the Dao arises.\n\nThe **virtuous person** delights in Heaven—\nthus, they preserve life.\n**Longevity and vitality** (*qian shou*) are inseparable—\nthis is **extending existence** (*yan sheng*).\n\nThe **virtuous person** serves Heaven—\nthus, their *huiming* endures.\nHence, you are everlasting and unceasing,\nyour transformations flow freely,\nand you attain the **unbreakable Vajra-body** (*jin gang bu huai zhi ti*),\nfulfilling the **imperishable Dharma-body** (*zhen chang wu lou zhi fa shen*).\n\n**Assemblage!**\nThe **Three Caverns** and **Four Palaces** of scriptural records,\n**five thousand three hundred** (*wu qian san bai*) **true texts**—\nonly those that extend existence and preserve life\ncan transcend the **kalpas** and rise above the dust.\n\nClinging to form is not preserving life—\ntrue emptiness is extending existence.\n\nThe *huiming* essence does not depart from *huiming*—\nthe *huiming* light is the *huiming* lamp.\nIf you wish the light to shine eternally,\nyour *huiming* must be steadfastly preserved.\n\nPreserved, it does not stray from **serene stillness** (*jing ding*)—\nthe lamp’s glow naturally attains **constant clarity** (*chang ming*).\n\nEnlightened to the **True Suchness Lamp** (*zhen ru deng*), it shines perpetually,\nilluminating the **good path** for all beings.\n\nIts **true substance** is without light to be seen—\nits **true clarity** cannot be named.\nIt is but the **original essence** within life,\nand when *huiming* opens, the illusory speech of light and darkness arises.\n\nIn this **world of form and emptiness** (*se kong shi jian*), life and death persist—\nyet **emptiness within form** (*kong se*) preserves life and extends existence.\n\nExtending existence is transcending the kalpas—\ntranscending the kalpas, what death or name could there be?\n\nAll beings, only because they are lost in *huiming*,\ndrift through kalpas, birth after birth.\n\nThe **Lamp of *Huiming*** and its **light** shine universally—\nyou must swiftly awaken to the **cause of discipline** (*jie yin*).\n\nNow, test your grasp of this wondrous method:\n**stillness within emptiness**—I point to you all.\n\n**My children!** My children!\nThe sutra says:\n*\"When it cannot be seen yet is used, life is preserved;\nWhen it is seen yet cannot be used, existence is extended.\nOnly extinguish the **active mind** (*dong xin*), not the **illuminating mind** (*zhao xin*), then existence is extended.\nBut extinguish the **dwelling mind** (*zhu xin*), and must solidify the **empty mind** (*ning kong xin*), then life is preserved.\nTo extend existence is to ensure the *huiming* does not cease—\nthus, the **Great Medicine** is complete.\nTo preserve life is to attain the **fruit of non-birth** (*wu sheng ke zheng*)—\nthus, the **Great Elixir** is fulfilled.*\n\n*\"Only through the Dao does life endure—\nif aligned, it is obtained;\nif misaligned, it is lost.\"*\n\n*\"Received from Heaven, reflecting Heaven’s luminous life,\neven Zhou—though ancient—renews its mandate;\nits essence is ever new.\"*\n\nAll are the **true principles** of preservation and extension—\nthis is called the **Great Dao of Establishing Life** (*li ming zhi da dao*).\n\nMy children, if you comprehend thus,\nyou have fully attained this wonder.\nNow, I will not spare even my most precious treasures,\nemptying my **bag of elixirs** (*qing nang dao*), revealing the **deepest mysteries** (*zhi xie xuan ji*).\n\nHere is a **gatha** of four lines—\nponder it carefully, all beings:\n*\"Life’s brevity and longevity stem from its

      "translated_text": "My disciples, though the Dao I spoke of yesterday—though its essence is *wuwei* and its body the Dharma-body—know this: the Dao-body is never separate from the constant body, and the Dharma-body dwells within the physical form itself.\n\nThe physical form, when firm, is adorned by the *meritorious deeds of the external*—the realm of *youwei*; the Dharma-body, when serene, is adorned by the *meritorious deeds of the internal*—the realm of *wuwei*. When both inner and outer are pure, and both are realized, then the spirit is liberated, the supreme unbroken true void shines forth—great radiance, perfect fulfillment, invincible, with all spirits paying homage, commanding thunder and lightning, guarding the Three Realms, and the Five Emperors welcoming it. This is not achieved through the cultivation of *youwei* merits.\n\nDisciples, if you refine and nourish the *qi*, the *qi* will settle and the essence will condense. If you still the fire and return the wind, the essence will transform into *qi*, permeating the Four Great Elements and harmonizing with all spirits. True fire without smoke makes the *qi* clear; spirit-water without leakage makes the spirit tranquil. Clear *qi* refines the spirit; tranquil spirit merges with emptiness. When emptiness is absolute and stillness profound, the original essence returns, and the Nine Returns and Seven Regressions occur, restoring the command to its root. Returning to the root establishes the command and preserves true nature. True nature preserved, the Dao-body manifests; the Dao-body manifest, the Dharma-body appears.\n\nDisciples, this is the Dao-body cultivated within *youwei* as *wuwei*, the Dharma-body cultivated within *wu* as *you*. The physical form has a lifespan; the Dharma-body has wisdom-life. Lifespan is granted by Heaven, not by oneself, so the physical form undergoes rebirth and death, cycling through kalpas. Wisdom-life is attained by oneself, not by Heaven, so the Dharma-body’s power is unbound, its liberation unobstructed.\n\nDisciples, the physical form’s lifespan is limited—fate cannot be escaped. Heaven decrees death, and death must come. The Dharma-body’s wisdom-life is boundless, its powers vast, eternally realizing the unborn. Only then does true longevity arise.\n\nDisciples, even if the physical form lingers for ten thousand years, it is but a demon—no Dao. The Dharma-body, ever present, is the sage’s true saying: *\"Morning hear the Dao, evening die—sufficient.\"* The Dharma-body dies yet does not perish; thus it is called eternal life. The physical body dies and dies again—thus it is impermanent.\n\nDisciples, if you realize the Dharma-body, even those with short, impermanent lives may attain longevity. If you cling to the physical form’s appearance, even those with boundless longevity may fall into rebirth.\n\nIn one word: pierce through the physical form, and all concerns dissolve. Cultivate with true sincerity, untainted by dust. Do not let the Dharma-body be bound by the physical form—only pierce the physical form to liberate the Dharma-body. Is this not the **Great Transformation**, the flourishing of the Dao’s momentum?\n\nNow, what I expound is the **Perpetual Transformation** of filial piety and the Dao. To restore the ancestral Dao’s brilliance, who else will protect the Dharma-body if it is not made clear? As it is said: *\"If the teaching is not expounded, the Dao remains obscure; if the Dao is obscure, the Dharma cannot be practiced; if the Dharma is not practiced, the Dao cannot be expounded.\"* The sage has said: *\"It is the person who expounds the Dao, not the Dao that expounds the person.\"* Only if you recognize those who expound the Dao, practice the Dharma of the Dao, and speak of its profound essence—how could the Dao’s lineage decline, or the ancestral wind fade?\n\nIn my youth, I was unlearned, my studies sparse. I did not master Confucian or Buddhist teachings but stubbornly sought Daoist learning, wandering the lands for decades, intent on tracing its source. What I sought was my own innate awareness; what I questioned was my original wisdom-nature. Through prolonged inner cultivation, my innate awareness revealed itself on the Cinnabar Platform; through deep inquiry, my wisdom-nature emerged in the Void Chamber. With an inner master, how could I not welcome guests and respond to visitors? With the true lineage within, I sought to expound the teaching and uphold the Dao.\n\nDisciples, I am unskilled in letters, ashamed before the Three Caverns’ treasures. Though I read some alchemical texts, I lacked access to the true elixir secrets. My nature being lazy, preferring leisure and stillness, I often cultivated wisdom-life, delving into the mysteries of the Immortal, abandoning all else to embrace the true essence. Where was the time to read Confucian texts or alchemical scriptures? Thus, to this day, I remain unlettered, my speech clumsy and blunt, yet I speak plainly of these supreme truths and hidden mysteries, revealing what has not yet been disclosed.\n\nYet the Dao is beyond words—why speak? The scriptures require no study—why open halls? The teaching is *wuwei*—why trouble oneself? This Dao belongs to all; never can it be absent for an instant. Whether in the world or the Dao, one may awaken to it, may seek it—why must one renounce the world and become a recluse, seeking teachers and friends? Only because of this matter of birth and death, unresolved in the heart, do people hunger for sustenance, roam the world, and search the ends of the earth for a way to return to the root and restore the command.\n\nFortunately, there are the Jade Purity, Upper Purity, and Supreme Purity, who transmitted scriptures, expounded the Dao, established teachings, and opened halls, propagating and transmitting the lineage to this day. Among them, Confucius’ disciples—Zhou Dunyi, the Two Chengs, Zhang Zai, and Zhu Xi—received the secrets of the sacred texts and elucidated the essence of the heart-method. Then there are the *Vajra Sutra*, the *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment*, and the *Heart Sutra*—the true doctrines of Buddhism, the profound mysteries of stilling the body and transcending desire. What the Three Teachings share is the single path of nature and life: all are methods of compassion, delivering beings from suffering and saving life.\n\nNow, I—though unworthy—am counted among the descendants of the Qiu lineage, following tradition to propagate the Dharma-treasures, receiving and transmitting the teaching as I have been taught.",

Now, in the twilight of the Dao, I have spent thirty years in heartfelt observance of precepts, adhering to the laws and following the rules. Through seeking truth, fate favored my will—at Rongwu, I encountered my teacher; in the Nine Palaces, I received the law. Over twenty years have passed.\n\nHeaven opened the Dao’s fortune, and I joyfully met the imperial era, encountering a flourishing age where officials and merchants take delight in goodness and benevolence. Fellow seekers of the Way had the right timing, and those inclined to cultivation found the moment. Thus, I opened halls and established precepts in the capital. Through eight seasons of teaching, the wind stirred a thousand truths. Both the refined and the common had the karmic connection, all taking refuge in precept and stillness, directly entering the wondrous Dao of purity and emptiness.\n\nI, the humble one, rely solely on this spark of insight, sincere and silent, moved by Heaven’s grace to attain true encounters. Presumptuously ascending the law-seat, I falsely claim the title of Preceptor. As for expounding the mysteries of the Dao and universally establishing sacred grounds, that is my deepest wish.\n\nDisciples, do not heed those who doubt and slander, clinging to their cushions, biting their teeth in silence, feigning the Dao’s form. In the end, they deceive only themselves. If such men speak of constant response and constant stillness—response to what? They cannot even preserve their own lives, how could they care for others’?\n\nListen well: *\"The precepts and scriptures come from the Dao Canon; transmitting the law by ritual is no falsehood. Only by expounding the teaching and saving all beings can I urge the lost to cease their blasphemy. Encourage all to broaden their tolerance, endure insults, and cultivate the true form of the teaching. With wisdom and insight both refined, virtue deepens, and all beings are delivered from suffering’s ocean. Those who receive precepts first sever their obstacles—when obstacles fall, light shines bright. Why fear dimmed wisdom? Only fear the radiance of ten thousand suns. Conceal the flame to preserve life, for wisdom endures. Do not cling to prolong life in illusion’s grasp. Embrace purity, nurture simplicity, and learn non-action. Wisdom and life extend, merging into vastness. If you cling to the colored body, you know not true longevity. Refusing to save others, you seek only self-liberation—how then could the Immortals save us? Ready-made robes, effortless meals—who provides them? How can rice from the Millet Ancestor or mountains of flour be consumed? A drop of water becomes the ocean’s roar, and the hell of Avīci’s cries. Deceiving others with offerings for ease, warm clothes and full bellies bring no thirst. With clever words and hollow speech, the Dao is already lost—promising ascension to lead you away. Those outside protect the name, offering more eagerly, like fools grasping at gold from water. How many mortals can awaken on their own? Who knows the year or month of their ascension? The enlightened know no jealousy; stillness comes first, self-liberation follows. In action, the Dao is expounded to save others—ten thousand words, one awakening. One awakening leads to universal salvation; salvation’s heart is firm and steadfast. The Dao flourishes, the teaching spreads, ancestral winds rise—liberation and true emptiness unite in heart-nature.\"*\n\n**Seventeen Methods of Saving Lives**\n\nDisciples, what I expound of the teaching and the Dao is not for myself, nor for the teaching itself—only to embody the Dao, follow Heaven’s law, and save all beings. In ancient times, the sages of the Three Teachings—if they had not acted for all beings, how could they have established teachings, transmitted scriptures, opened halls, and revealed truth through every means, exhausting their compassion?\n\nDisciples, the Confucian path has its most exalted teacher. His virtue harmonizes with the Supreme Ultimate; his Dao gathers the Great Achievement. He is neither rigid nor absolute, neither self-centered nor indifferent to others. He edited the Classics, established music, praised the *Yijing*, and upheld rites. In all things, he carried out the transformations of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*; in every direction, he elucidated the scriptures of filial piety and righteousness. The Dao was passed to Zengzi and Mengzi, bearing a heavy burden for the ages. He became the eternal teacher of scholars and the guiding sage of the people. Had it not been for Zengzi and Mengzi receiving the transmission in the Zhou Dynasty, and the Chengs and Zhu elaborating on it in the Song, how could there be the present day?\n\nThe Buddhist path originated with the Western Sage, Shakyamuni Buddha. He practiced austerities on the snow mountain, abandoned his kingdom and family, subdued his body and mind, and fulfilled his merits and practices. The Five Aggregates are empty, the Six Senses are pure. He manifested all wondrous forms, transforming himself in the ten directions. When Emperor Ming of Han dreamed of the golden man, the white horse came from the West, bringing the *Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom in Forty-Two Sections*—the Golden Prajnaparamita. The teaching spread among the Eastern people, and the title \"Tathagata\" was honored. The law was transmitted to the Sixth Patriarch, and the revered golden halls of the Brahmins were upheld. The Great Vehicle’s compassionate sovereign—if not for our Buddha’s transmission, how could the golden statues of the Arhat be venerated today?\n\nThe Dao is established by the Three Pure Ones, boundless and ineffable, towering and unfathomable. Its scriptures are profound and secret, passed down by sages. Manifesting in person to teach, it endures through kalpas, guiding beings from the sea of suffering and saving the world across the ages. It is the Three Officials transmitting the law, the Five Peaks opening halls. Pure Yang Lu Zu, the Master of the Three Teachings, issued the Five Thunder Orders, appearing in all directions, revealing the mysteries externally. With great compassion and great filial piety, great benevolence and great孝, he forgot fame and left behind incense and offerings. He transmitted to our Qiu ancestor, who diligently upheld the Dao and preserved benevolence, presenting the Red Book at the Phoenix Gate. He established the sect, transmitted precepts, and revived the pure laws at Dragon Gate. Through countless hardships, he vowed to save beings, earning the titles of the Venerable Long Spring True Lord and the Repeatedly Venerated Heaven-Responding Sage.\n\nHe illuminates all dharmadhatus, and all benefit from his boundless grace.",

      "translated_text": "「Practicing virtue and establishing *virtue/power* (德), manifesting all manner of divine powers (神通), is solely for the sake of delivering all beings (濟度眾生) and enabling them to attain the Dao/Way (同臻大道).\n\nAll disciples, those who seek to deliver others must do so with utmost sincerity and earnestness (苦苦切切), first delivering themselves (先度自己), and then others (然後度人). Now, if the transmission of the sect (教相) does not proceed, and the *Dao/Way* (玄隐) of the Quanzhen lineage (宗門) remains obscured, it is precisely because the fundamental affliction (大病) has not been eradicated here.\n\nWhy does the Dao/Way not manifest (大道不行), and why is the sect’s tradition so meager (教門哀薄)? All disciples, it is because the core principle of Quanzhen—*\"unable to deliver oneself, only to deliver others\"* (不能度已，只要度人)—these eight characters bear the great root of sin (大罪根), which inherently undermines the Quanzhen sect’s authentic transmission (公案).\n\nAll disciples, you who preach the sect: if you cannot even follow its teachings yourself (自己不能依教奉行), yet insist on urging others to do so (先要勸人依教奉行), who will believe you? How can Quanzhen be said to fail in self-delivery (全真不能度已)? All disciples, hear me!\n\nTo deliver all beings (度眾生) is to deliver the beings within oneself (度自己之眾生). What are these beings within oneself? All disciples, they are the delusive thoughts and illusory fantasies (雜念妄想) that arise from one’s own original mind (自己本心中之眾生). Within the Quanzhen practitioner’s abdomen (腹內), there are eighty-four thousand illusory fantasies and delusive thoughts (妄想雜念), meaning eighty-four thousand beings (即是有八萬四千眾生).\n\nWithin a single day, across the twelve *double-hours* (二六時中), even while seated on the meditation cushion (身座蒲團), one’s mind wanders through the world (心遊世上). The moment one delusive thought is extinguished (妄心才灭), another arises (妄念又來). The seven emotions (七情) never cease, and the six desires (六欲) ensnare one; the three poisons (三毒) drag one down, and the eight consciousnesses (八識) invert one’s perception.\n\nLike floating clouds obscuring the sun (如浮雲掩日), they drift east and west (東去西來); like raging waves driven by the wind (狂浪因風), they surge westward and dash eastward (西馳東蕩). Day and night, they never still (終朝日夜，何曾靜得一時); month after month, year after year, one fails to fix even a single thought (累月經年，未能定得一念). Not only while seated on the cushion (不但坐在蒲團), but even while walking the path (就走在道路), or in dreams (至于夢寐), how often does one cast aside delusive thoughts (那刻撇去妄心) and uphold a pure, right-minded intention (把持正念)?\n\nIf the mind does not rest (心不休), the body cannot be delivered (身不度); if thoughts are not singular (念不一), the Dao/Way remains unclear (道不明). Thus, within the Quanzhen lineage (全真門內), one must absolutely cease thoughts and rest the mind (必須要止念休心), only then can the true nature of the mind (天心) emerge (出現), and the luminous wisdom (慧光) reveal itself (發露).\n\nAll practitioners, if Quanzhen is practiced in this manner, then one may truly be called a *compatriot of the Dao* (同志). That is why it is said: first deliver oneself (先度已), then it is proper to go and deliver others (方好去度化眾人不遲).\n\nNow, how does one deliver oneself? Through **unyielding resolve** (剛烈), **courageous vigor** (勇猛), **diligence** (精進), **renunciation** (舍除), **almsgiving** (布施), **heightened clarity** (高明), **humility** (謙遜), **liberation** (解脫), and **spontaneity** (自然).\n\nAll disciples, you must focus your will (用志不分) and concentrate your spirit (凝神), purifying your thoughts (澄虑). Those with affinity for the Dao (同志有機緣的), listen attentively to me, and I will point out these nine essential principles (一一指那九件道要).\n\nAh, what is **unyielding resolve** (剛烈)? The teachings of the transcendent world (出世法) and those of the mundane world (世法) are inherently opposed (本來相反), differing in right and wrong (順逆不同), and conflicting in principles (方圆不合). The practice of the transcendent teachings (出世法) requires one to first regard the illusory appearances of the world (世間的幻相) and the delusive fantasies of the physical form (色身的幻想) as false (兩般先看假了). One must sever ties with children, spouse, and kin (子女妻孥), cutting off all entanglements of affection (恩情斩断); abandon fame and wealth (功名富有), rejecting the allure of sensory pleasures (味美裘馬), and free oneself from clinging attachments (留戀葛藤). With a singular, resolute heart (一心), one must leap beyond confusion and excrement (跳出迷屙), maintaining a pure and unfluctuating will (洁志不浮). This is called **unyielding resolve** (是曰剛烈). It is also known as the **staff of subduing demons** (降魔杵) and the **platform of slaying fiends** (斩妖台).\n\nWhat is **courageous vigor** (勇猛)? Hesitation and indecision (優柔不斷) allow the mind to wander (遊思或往來); when one loses hold of the method (把柄脫離), the light of clarity may be obscured (光明或開蔽). The mind should not be like autumn’s moon (心不同於秋月), ever luminous and clear (皎皎常明); the spirit should not ascend to morning mist (神不登於朝霞), radiant yet reversed (煌煌反照). Delay and laziness (迟延懈怠) make one drift with the waves and follow the currents (逐浪隨波); frivolity and indulgence (玩忽優悠) lead to perpetual vacillation (朝三暮四). One cannot achieve a sudden, sweeping clarity of the chest (胸襟一朝廓落) or an instant, unclouded brightness of vision (眼光立地澄清).\n\nTo exert effort on the mind (心上加功), one must cast aside all worldly concerns (全抛身世); in the Dao/Way, one must endure hardships (道中苦行) and crush the forces of illusion (摧卻邪魔). One must pierce through the iron walls and bronze ramparts of ignorance (鑽通鐵壁銅牆), awakening to the reality of heaven and hell (悟這是天堂地獄). All disciples, that is why after **unyielding resolve** (剛烈), one must also add **courageous vigor** (勇猛).\n\nWhat is **diligence** (精進)? This **unyielding resolve** (剛烈) is the severing of bonds of enmity and kinship (割斷恩仇), cultivating the mind and establishing one’s life (修心立命). This **courageous vigor** (勇猛) is the subjugation of scattered thoughts (降伏散亂), disciplining the wandering mind (整訪遊移), and stabilizing the luminous spirit (神明鎮定).\n\nBut what is the **greater diligence** (更精進者)? This is the scholar’s pursuit of the nature of birth and death (參求生死), before this very body has manifested (此身未有之前), asking: where were you? After this body perishes (此身死殁之後), where will you go? All things in the world—heaven, earth, and the ten thousand phenomena (世間天地萬物), daily and ordinary (日用平常)—are none other than the Dao/Way (無不是道). Whatever the eyes see (眼之所見), whatever the ears hear (耳之所聞), there is not a single thing outside the Dao/Way (無一物能出道外).\n\nThings have beginnings and endings (物有本末), which are their birth and death (即是物之生死); events have starts and finishes (事有始終), which are their birth and death (即是事之生死). If one uses the mind to investigate and reflect (用心參悟), with persevering will and meticulous pursuit (苦志精搜), one can clarify the origins and endings of things (能明物之本末), thereby understanding the birth and death of this body (則能明身之生死); one can clarify the conclusion and commencement of affairs (能明事之終始), thereby understanding the arising and cessation of the mind (則能明心之起滅了).\n\nBy examining all things and events (從事物上), subtly feeling and deeply comprehending (細細體貼，實實理會), one can penetrate the birth-and-death mechanism (生死之機) and the principle of arising and cessation (起滅之理) of even a single thing or event (自一物以至萬物，自一事以至萬事), without failing to grasp their nature. Then, the understanding of origins, birth-and-death, arising, and cessation all become a unified practice (都成一貫功夫), and only then can one approach the Dao/Way’s true nature (方能於道相近了).\n\nAfterward, one must focus the mind on the Dao/Way (冥心大道), pursuing it with the utmost refinement (微細追求), penetrating its hidden depths (洞明幽隱), and comprehending its profound mysteries (曉會玄機). In silent recognition (默識), one must align with the true nature of the mind (天心), and in secret communion (密通) with the sect’s essence (宗旨), one can awaken this singular point of subtle *qi* (這一點虚靈) to clarity (不昧), penetrating the source of its flow (進透源流). Thus, one responds to all things without confusion (應萬物而不迷), discerns all affairs without doubt (理萬事而不惑).\n\nIf one does not diligently pursue (不肯精進), but instead grows lax and negligent (自懈自怠), then one is abandoning oneself (自暴自棄), willingly becoming a lowly specter (甘為下鬼), lacking true aspiration for cultivation (無志真修). Even if one sits cross-legged for a hundred years (纵是趺坐百年), or extends one’s life for a thousand years (延生千載), ultimately, one will still fall into the impermanence of death (終歸無常), remaining trapped in the cycle of rebirth (仍落輪迴).\n\nWhat is **renunciation** (舍除)? It is the abandonment of former coarse and vulgar ways (舍去以前粗俗), and the eradication of all external, heterodox paths (除盡旁門外道). From this point onward, one must newly practice (新行), with absolute sincerity (一誠) directed toward the highest (向上). This singular point of subtle *qi* (這一點的虚靈) that does not stray from the true sect (不昧真宗) is the **primordial treasure of all beings** (元元至寶), ever-transforming and boundless (千變萬化), without fixed form (無有定體).」",

      "translated_text": "「When encountering things and events, the application of each is distinct, and the response to each is unique. At every turn, perception arises like a shadow; in every moment, confusion entangles the mind. Following the subtle and wondrous *灵机* (spontaneous wisdom), layer by layer, one penetrates and delves into the profound. Yet even so, the more one moves, the more one emerges—its resources are boundless, its application ceaseless. Those who awaken attain it themselves; those who remain ignorant are far removed.\n\nNow, I fear that if you can grasp even a fraction of this awakening, you will be able to uphold it and awaken further, never abandoning this awakening to seek another, for then you would have fallen into the *無常* (impermanence) of it. Instead, take this unchanging, constant *灵机* (spontaneous wisdom) and transform it to apply to the ever-changing, impermanent matters of the world. Then clarity of principle and manifestation of nature will shine forth; abandoning the old and embracing the new, you will pierce deeper layer by layer, ascending step by step toward the highest peak. Without reaching a state of lofty independence, how could one fathom profound wisdom, illuminate the mysteries of birth and death, and transcend the world beyond? How could one sever the doubts that bind across countless *劫* (kalpas)?\n\nWhat is **布施** (dāna/generosity)? Like yesterday’s awakened insight or the former subtleties of wisdom—whatever is attained and understood must be either shared with all beings or stored within the *黍米* (sūlima, the smallest grain of rice, symbolizing the minutest essence). It must not be hoarded, nor allowed to muddle the *灵台* (spiritual platform). The past is unattainable, the future is unattainable, and even this present moment is unattainable. Within this unattainability, if one further uncovers a self-attained marvel, then perfect wisdom will be illuminated.\n\nGenerosity with wealth is called cultivating merit. Generosity with the **法** (dharma/teaching) is called cultivating wisdom. Wealth can be exhausted through generosity, but my teachings—generosity with them—is boundless. Generosity with wealth can aid others in worldly matters, provide sustenance for the physical form, and adorn the outward appearance with splendor. Yet wealth can be depleted, leaving one empty-handed.\n\nMy generosity with the **法** (dharma/teaching) applies both to worldly and transcendent paths. Further, generosity with the **法** can awaken the confused, elevate the latent wisdom in all beings. However, generosity with wealth is not the mundane wealth of this world. Ordinary people may nurture life, save others, relieve emergencies, assist the helpless, ward off disasters, and bring prosperity to the nation—all manner of actions that fulfill the will of heaven, control the forces of yin and yang, and span the heavens and earth with boundless, limitless wonders. This wealth is the innate talent of beings, the very essence that manifests as the **善才童子** (Guanyin’s attendant, Shantizhu, the embodiment of skillful means) in the great bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara’s retinue.\n\nAh! You must know: to seek the treasures of heaven, one must use the wealth of the world. This worldly wealth is not the common wealth of the world; it is the **法财** (dharma-wealth) of self-liberation, called the **神宝** (divine treasure), and thus it can invoke the treasures of heaven. This daily practice is none other than generosity with the **法** (dharma/teaching). Those who attain this understanding are the foremost wise ones of countless *劫* (kalpas).\n\nWhat is **高明** (lofty brilliance)? To truly cultivate generosity with wondrous teachings and liberate all beings, one must perceive the true loftiness and attain perfect, unfathomable wisdom. All things in heaven and earth possess this luminous nature. If I treat the **法** (dharma/teaching) as fixed law, then I am clinging to the **法** (dharma/teaching). Clinging to the **法** (dharma/teaching) as law is dead **法** (dharma/teaching), not living **法** (dharma/teaching)—this is a lack of lofty perception.\n\nThus, if I apply my own rigid methods to teach others or impose fixed principles upon the world, it becomes a lifeless, mechanical **法** (dharma/teaching). This is like driving pegs into a post or shaking oars against the wind—it is the equivalent of binding oneself to a rigid column or striking a lute out of tune. One must instead hold to the boundless, upright brilliance, guiding at every moment, acting in accordance with circumstances, and flexibly expounding. If one applies round methods to square circumstances, they cannot adapt. If one teaches the foolish with wisdom, it does not suit their nature.\n\nOne must discern the foolish and speak to them in terms they can understand, making the truth clear and accessible. Adjusting to their capacity, they may gradually awaken. If one speaks to the wise as to the foolish, it is also not in accord with circumstances. The teachings must be such that both the wise and the humble can grasp them, blending seamlessly with life’s spontaneity—so that the wise see wisdom, and the compassionate see compassion.

      "translated_text": "「Where is there still a sentient being before you? From ancient times to today, the two-vehicle *arhat*s (乘), lesser-vehicle *bodhisattva*s (菩萨), and lowly *xianzi* (仙子) have all suffered from this affliction. Deeply entrenched, they remain utterly unaware. Thus, they are called the **small vehicle’s inferior roots** (劣根), the **heterodox outer teachings** (旁门外教), and **perverse Dao/magic** (邪道魔法). If so, they fail to grasp the **boundless formless** (无定体), the **unfathomable transformation** (神化不测). How could you confine or seize what transcends all limits?\n\nBounded things—how could they presumptuously exalt themselves? Have you not heard that the **Highest Sage** (太上) does not dare to lead the world first? It does not claim precedence in blessings, nor does it boast of its own Way, nor does it flaunt its own virtue/power. It advances by retreating as its principle, and stands high by taking lowliness as its foundation. It sets aside its own body yet the body remains; it yields its own position yet the body takes precedence. While others vie to lead, it alone retreats behind. **Lofty virtue is not virtue** (上德不德), **superior worth has no strife** (上士无争). It is unseen yet seen, not proud, not self-exalted, not self-assertive. It gives to others and thus its own virtue/power is all the more abundant; it benefits others and thus its own virtue/power is all the more plentiful.\n\nI do not know its name—let me call it **Dao** (道). The higher one ascends to lofty brilliance, the more one practices the **humble and retiring virtue/power** (卑退之功夫). With humility and gentleness, one preserves the **thick Dao** (厚道). One way, it universally manifests **compassionate wisdom** (慈慧); another way, it safeguards and nurtures its **radiant essence** (光芒). A nation’s most potent tools should not be displayed to others—if I do not compel others to submit, they will naturally submit to me. At this stage, the **liberation’s profound principle** (解脱道理) cannot be overlooked.\n\nWhat is **liberation** (解脱)? All disciples who cling to attachments do not understand **Dao/virtue** (道德). Free and unencumbered, they are not entangled by the *dharma* (法); stark and unadorned, they are not burdened by material things. Perfectly round and harmonious, they adapt teachings to the situation; radiant and luminous, they guide sentient beings across countless eons. Entering the **Gate of Marvelous Perfection** (妙门), they become the **Mother of All Sentient Beings** (众生之母). Compassion can love all things, yet it does not take loving all things as its own compassion; goodness can aid others, yet it does not take aiding others as its own goodness. The **Marvelous Law** (妙法) can liberate all sentient beings, yet it does not take liberating sentient beings as its own Marvelous Law; the **Supreme Way** (至道) can transcend the world, yet it does not take transcending the world as its own Supreme Way.\n\nIt can both emerge from suffering and endure suffering. Above, it can transcend celestial palaces, yet does not regard the **Heavenly Abode** (天宫) as a place of joy; below, it can universally rescue the **Hell Realms** (地狱), yet does not take the Hell Realms as a source of torment. When encountering suffering, it liberates others from it; when encountering joy, it shares it with all. In joy, it can point out the suffering of sentient beings; in困境 (*困中*), it can illuminate the happiness of sentient beings. In heaven, it guides **celestial beings, dragons, ghosts, and spirits** (天龙鬼神), enabling them to hear the **True Awakening** (正觉) and attain **transcendent immortality** (仙功); on earth, it liberates **culpable, suffering souls** (罪业亡魂), allowing them to behold **radiant clarity** (光明) and be reborn into the **human realm** (人界); in the human world, it guides all **virtuous men and faithful women** (善男信女) to universally practice **daily mundane conduct** (日用寻常), **non-action and rectitude** (无为正直), **loyalty, sincerity, and fairness** (忠信公平), and the **Great Dao of the Virtuous** (贤良大道). It does not teach those of the **four occupations** (士农工商) to enter the **lower vehicle’s petty methods** (下乘小法), to manipulate **vital essence and spirit** (精魂), to fall into **demonic and malevolent destinies** (着魔恶趣), or to engage in **battles with *modu* (修罗)**.\n\nIn this liberation, one must attain **spontaneous efficacy** (自然之用), which is the **Way of Freedom** (自在之道). What is **spontaneity** (自然)? All disciples, this **spontaneous marvel** (自然之妙) is the **Heart Sutra’s** (心经) **Bodhisattva of Boundless Perception** (观自在菩萨), who is **the One Who Hears the World’s Sounds** (观世音), perceiving the sounds of the world. Those who grasp this **spontaneous marvel** become **the Boundless Perception Bodhisattva within themselves** (自我自在观音)—the **Observing Bodhisattva of the Southern Sea** (南海之观音). It is the **form of the pure other shore** (彼岸清静真空之妙相), the **principle of void and spontaneity** (虚无自然之理), able to perceive the **form of true sound** (真音之妙相). Without a true teacher’s guidance, how could one awaken to the **form of true void** (真空妙相)?\n\nAh, disciples! **Form is void, void is form** (色即是空空是色)—if not void, not form, the Dao is not true. The **true void’s marvelous form** (真空妙相) is the **constant Dao** (真常道); if neither void nor form, the marvel is boundless. It shares **one body with my void** (虚空), and **my void has no division with it** (没分己). It enters **metals and stones** (金石) yet causes no obstruction; it enters **water and fire** (水火) yet suffers no harm.\n\nDisciples, you must carefully ponder the **Nine Chapters of Dao’s Essentials** (九章道要), hold fast to the **Simple Core** (薄团), and awaken to all **marvelous forms** (妙相). Once you align with **spontaneity** (自然), the **three families** (三家) have already been verified—you will perfectly guide others, with boundless merit and virtue/power that even **ghosts and spirits submit to** (鬼神). Perverse *Dao* (邪魔) will be disarmed, and **demons will be dispirited** (妖精落魄). Why fear that the world will not believe and follow you?\n\nIt is the **universal liberation’s merit and practice** (普度功行), the **benevolent heart’s efficacy** (利济心), and the **diligent cultivation of one’s own liberation** (勤参度己后天人). With a sincere resolve toward the **constant Dao** (真常道), the **Boundless Perception Bodhisattva** (观音菩萨) will naturally protect your path. The **Nine Chapters’ Marvelous Precepts** (九章妙典) transcend the mundane world; the **one complete truth** (一片全真) is polished deeply. **Alms-giving’s subtle words** (布施微言) reveal the **true marvelous principle** (真妙理); **dual cultivation of nature and life** (双修性命) does not spare effort. **Insight is lofty and brilliant** (见识高明), offering many **teachings** (说法); **gentleness and humility** (仁柔卑逊) do not boast of ability. Abandoning external forms and forgetting self and others, one walks the **True Suchness of Heaven’s Great Dao** (真如天心大道). **Effortless liberation** (逍遥解脱) expounds the **supreme void’s profound Dao** (无上真空玄玄道). Even the **smallest fire** (小火) does no harm when the **three lineages** (三姓) are united—**merit is complete, practice is fulfilled**, and one ascends to the **clouds** (云霄).\n\nThe **Eighteenfold Wisdom** (十八智慧) shines brightly.\n\nDisciples, you have received the **Three Hundred Great Precepts of the Central Extremity** (中极三百大戒), practicing **secrecy** (密行) and **subtle conduct** (微细威仪)—this is not like the **initial true precepts** (初真戒) of your former days. These **precise and profound rules** (律条) must be applied diligently in your own heart. Whenever a thought or intention arises, you must **uphold sincerity and reverence** (存诚主敬), **examine and reflect inwardly** (暗自端详), **inspect and correct yourself** (省察提撕), and **maintain central rectitude** (大中正直). Sweep away the **pensive thoughts** (念头) in your heart, making it **spotlessly pure** (清清净净). Like the **verdant sky and radiant moon**, there is not a trace of clouds or shadows; like **crystal and polished glass**, there is not a speck of blemish; like **limitless bright mirrors**, there is not a particle of dust; like **night-pearls** (夜明珠), there is not a thread of darkness. Steady and round, **radiant and resplendent** (光灿灿), one may then **deliver the Dao** (讲道). **Wisdom and radiance** (智慧光明), **true void’s marvelous form** (真空妙相), all arise from **precepts and concentration** (戒定).",

Had it not been for the **Celestial Worthy’s** opening of the serene mind and awakening of boundless aspiration **fifteen hundred kalpas** ago, seeking to deliver all beings and lead them to the peak of perfection—then declaring that the **source is emptiness**, with neither sound to hear nor form to see—if there is no sound to hear, then **forget the ears**; if there is no form to perceive, then **forget the eyes**. When ears and eyes are forgotten, then hearing and seeing will also vanish. Thus, ears and eyes, having form and color, are the leaders of the **six senses**; hearing and seeing, clinging to appearances and thoughts, are truly the **roots of the six senses**. How could they align with the **Dao**?\n\nIf one can purify the **six aspects** and sweep away the **six cognitions**, then the ears that do not listen **listen with the mind**, and the eyes that do not see **see with the spirit**. Thus, one does not listen yet hears, does not see yet sees. Without hearing or seeing, one is in accord with the **Dao**.\n\nThe *Chìwén Dònggǔ Jīng* says:\n*\"To forget the eyes, light overflows without limit;\nTo forget the ears, the mind’s depths remain ever still.\nBoth mechanisms forgotten, one enters the gate of all marvels.\nSeeing without seeing me, hearing without hearing—\nDetached from all boundaries, this is called the **Mystic Way**.\"*\n\nThe *Nánhuá Jīng* says:\n*\"Qi halts at the ears, the heart halts at the talisman.\"*\n\nThus, the *Jūshū Jīng* says:\n*\"To forget form and self is the mechanism of entering the **Dao**.\nAgain, with sincerity one enters—this ‘sincerity’ is **precept**.\nWith silence one guards—this ‘silence’ is **observing precepts to subdue body and mind**.\nTo use silence as if speechless is to enter **samādhi**, forgetting ears and eyes.\nTo act with gentleness as if clumsy is to conceal wisdom within the profound.\nAgain it says:\n‘You seek within your own colored form to hear or see—\nYet it will never be visible or audible.’*\n\nThe *Vajra Sūtra* says:\n*\"If one seeks me through form or sound,\nThat person walks the crooked path and cannot see the Tathāgata.\"*\n\nNow, those who seek the **Dao** must **receive precepts and enter samādhi**, secretly cultivating wisdom, confusing clarity with obscurity, yet not hearing while hearing, not seeing while seeing. Thus, those entering the **Dao** know **restraint**—this is the practice of **observing precepts and stilling thoughts**; know **caution**—this is the practice of **solitary vigilance and diligence**; know **subtlety**—this is the practice of **abandoning the sage and discarding wisdom**.\n\nTo still thoughts, one must **observe precepts**; to practice solitary vigilance, one must **enter samādhi**; to know subtlety, one must **cultivate wisdom**. If one truly **observes precepts, enters samādhi, and cultivates wisdom**, then body and mind will be perfectly tranquil, sacred wisdom complete, and luminous insight universally radiant. When the luminous insight penetrates, one merges with the **Dao**—this is called **true forgetting**. This **true forgetting** is not the **true forgetting** of sitting idle in empty meditation, but **true emptiness**. Within this **true emptiness**, there exists a **purple-golden wondrous form**—the marvel of **emptiness within non-emptiness**. If one does not fall into **coarse emptiness**, yet remains within **non-emptiness**, then the **subtle essence** naturally manifests. It is only because of **forgetting without forgetting what is forgotten** that one attains the **supreme and wondrous Way**.\n\nAgain it says:\n*\"Fools and sages differ—thus clarity and turbidity vary.\nThough shaped by unequal **inherited wind and soil**,\nAll are mechanisms of **creation’s workings**,\nDivine motion unfolding naturally,\nThe logic of **qi and fate**—already decreed by destiny.\nYet fools make themselves foolish, sages make themselves wise—\nHow could Heaven reward or punish their wisdom or folly?\nOnly by awakening a **serene mind** and establishing a **boundless aspiration**—\nTo depart the world and deliver others,\nOne must first hear the **Dao** and deliver oneself.\nThose who deliver themselves **take refuge in the Three Jewels**,\nReceive precepts, enter samādhi,\nCultivate wisdom to emit radiance—\nThen fools may become wise, and the turbid may become clear.\nIf one cannot **observe precepts, enter samādhi**, or penetrate wisdom,\nWithout radiance to illuminate,\nThen clarity may become turbid, and wisdom may become folly.\"*\n\nThe *Vajra Sūtra* says:\n*\"My teachings have no fixed form—\nThis is what is meant.\"*\n\nThe wisdom-light spoken of—**resplendent, vast, and profound**—illuminates the **dharma-realm**. How could it ever transcend the *Jūshū Bǎo Jīng*? **Jūshū** is the **true mechanism**. Those who wish to **turn the scripture** must first **turn the true mechanism**, secretly cultivating **merit and wisdom**. Yet I fear the **hidden light** cannot be opened or seen.\n\nHow could one **discern the forms of ghosts and spirits**, grasp the **pivot of creation**, participate in **Heaven and Earth’s transformation**, govern the **movement of sun and moon**, contain the **dharma-realm within a grain of millet**, and settle all things **before their origin**—to be called **Master of the Mystic Way**, advancing to the **Celestial Immortal’s realm**?\n\nIt is said:\n*\"Seeing the hidden light, one hears the **Dao’s root**.\nWithout cultivating **precepts and samādhi**, how could wisdom’s light be profound?\nClinging to appearances is not the true form—\nOnly by forgetting hearing can one truly hear.\nHearing, thinking, and cultivating enter the marvel—\nThe boundless ocean’s sound, free and at ease.\"*\n\n**The Nineteen Marvels of Divine Powers**\n\nDisciples, the wisdom-light of the **Dao** spoken of above—**the *Jūshū Jīng*** merely says that **hearing and seeing are extinguished**. Without hearing or seeing, the **marvels are already exhausted**, and **divine powers manifest**.\n\nThe *Yīnfú Jīng* says:\n*\"The deaf see, the blind hear.\"*\n\nAncient immortals say:\n*\"In stillness, no thunder is heard;\nIn deep gaze, no Mount Tài is seen.\"*\n\nThe *Zhōngyōng* says:\n*\"The virtue of ghosts and spirits—\nHow magnificent it is!\nTo see them, yet not see;\nTo hear them, yet not hear.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「The Twenty-Second Insight into the Primordial Source:\nAll disciples, this single point of unobscured void and spirit—\nIs it not easily seen? Who then is this Primordial Source, the True Person of my Essence?\n\nFrom ancient times to now, sages, immortals, Buddhas, and ancestral masters of the Dao,\nSat facing walls for nine years,\nOr meditated in circles for six seasons,\nCounting three threes and seven sevens,\nToiling and striving in earnest pursuit.\n\nThey traversed famous mountains and wandered blessed lands,\nSought teachers and questioned friends,\nInquired about the Way and listened to scriptures,\nPracticed austere deeds and accumulated virtue through almsgiving.\n\nAll manner of cultivation—\nYet only to grasp this body’s life and death, its great karmic cause,\nUnknown whence it came, unknown whither it goes,\nLost in wandering, sinking in rebirth,\nUnable to escape the Wheel of Existence—\nThus they vow and strive in practice.\n\nSome seek to sever thought and forget emotion,\nAs the path to transcendence,\nAnd sit in meditation for three or five years,\nBreaking countless *zazen* mats—\nYet how often has thought truly ceased,\nOr emotion been forgotten?\nThis is but the five returning to the ten.\n\nSome use *tianlian* (cooking lead) and *lianggong* (refining mercury)\nAs the path to transcendence,\nAnd perform morning and evening rituals—\nRetiring talismans, adding flames—\nYet how often have they seen the seven returns of the Jade Elixir,\nOr the nine returns of the Golden Elixir?\nHow often have they caught the thief,\nOnly to release the thief again?\n\nSome meditate on the Supreme Sovereign in silent devotion for three days.\nSome refine and liberate to aid the lost,\nRescuing wandering souls from the Nine Realms of the Underworld;\nSome call upon deities and summon generals,\nWearing talismans to command the True Persons;\nSome raise *qi* and open the gates,\nCirculating vital essence to proclaim the Wondrous Dao;\nSome recite scriptures and toil in worship;\nSome prepare elixirs to heal sickness and mend wounds;\nSome refine and consume alchemical substances,\nHoping to ascend to the heavens;\nSome imitate the *yin-yang* arts in gathering and taking;\nSome breathe within the *dingqi* vessel,\nUsing divine *qi* to transmute lead and prolong life and command;\nSome tend the sand-fire in the furnace,\nRefining *maogen* (hemp roots),\nEstablishing merit through almsgiving.\n\nSome cling to bodily suffering,\nEmbracing the *jin dan* (golden elixir) path,\nWaiting for transmission to those of fortune.\n\nSome, with shallow karmic roots,\nPractice the most difficult of deeds,\nYet abandon them at the cliff’s edge.\n\nAll these obscure the true nature,\nEngage in illusory cultivation—\nThey are but side paths.\n\nAll disciples,\nTo sever thought and forget emotion,\nYou must first perceive where thought arises,\nWhere emotion originates,\nTo grasp it firmly,\nTo press it steadily,\nTo recognize it truly,\nTo point it out clearly—\nOnly then may you proceed to sever,\nOnly then may you proceed to forget.\n\nNow I ask you:\nWho is this one who knows how to grasp,\nHow to seize,\nHow to recognize,\nHow to point out,\nHow to sever thought,\nHow to forget emotion?\n\nEven if you sever thought and forget emotion,\nBreak countless meditation mats—\nThought remains thought,\nEmotion remains emotion.\n\nThe assembly,\nSevering thought as thought,\nIs called *putting one’s head on top of one’s head*;\nForgetting emotion as emotion,\nIs called *catching the thief and releasing the thief*.\n\nBetter yet,\nTo forget the very law of forgetting,\nTo sever the very law of severing—\nBoth roots forgotten,\nEntering the Gate of Marvels—\nThis alone is the supreme teaching.\n\nAll disciples,\nWhen I sever thought from the law,\nYou do not know that the law itself is the thought’s origin;\nWhen I sever emotion from the law,\nYou do not know that the law itself is the seed of emotion.\n\nThe assembly,\nSevering thought is not as good as thought severing itself,\nForgetting emotion is not as good as emotion forgetting itself—\nThis is called *seeking others is not as good as seeking oneself*.\n\nAll disciples,\nThose who transmute lead and refine mercury,\nWho adjust the fire’s stages,\nWho mimic the *yin-yang* hexagrams—\nThey mutilate the *Taiqi* (Great Polarity) and *Hunyuan* (Chaos Primordial),\nTaking false names as true practice,\nPointing at metaphors as actual deeds.\n\nThey rashly speak of the Three Fields,\nBlindly guess at vital *qi* and essence,\nThe seven emotions as mechanical traps,\nThe nine orifices as pivotal hinges.\n\nThey take the seven characters and nine characters,\nThe returns and exchanges,\nAs seven times, nine times,\nSeven rounds, nine rounds,\nSeven stages, nine stages,\nSeven years, nine years,\nSeven transformations, nine transformations.\n\nThis drawing of diagrams,\nThat summoning of forms—\nToday it is *Kan* and *Li* (Water and Fire) interacting,\nTomorrow it is *Earth-Heaven* (Tai) harmony,\nThe day after it is *Hun* and *Po* (soul and spirit) merging,\nThis year it is the same infant,\nNext year it is the same infant—\nUntil nine years pass,\nStill an ignorant, unborn sinner.\n\nThey do not know their own errors,\nYet shake their heads,\nCurse their fingers,\nAnd face outsiders with false claims:\n*\"On that day, I conceived the holy child,\nThe fire’s stages were nurtured correctly,\nThe bathing time was not amiss—\nYet why, after ten months, does no infant appear?\nIs it because our fate is shallow, our sins deep,\nAnd the spirits do not allow fulfillment?\"*\n\nThey clutch their bellies,\nAge their faces,\nStrain their eyes,\nAnd shed hollow tears.\n\nDo you know these base-rooted, foolish ones?\nThey do not recognize their own heart,\nNor understand their true nature—\nTheir karma is thick as night,\nWhat wisdom could they possess?\nDo you know these people?\nThey still aspire upward,\nYet remain in darkness,\nUnawakened to the path of ascent.\n\nYour body’s essence and *qi*,\nAre the Primordial *Yuanqi* (Original *Qi*) and *Yuanjing* (Original Essence)—\nUnincreasing, undiminishing treasures.\nIf you stir them,\nThey do not grow;\nIf you do not stir them,\nThey do not wane.\n\nThis unobscured void and spirit—\nThe true essence—\nIs the Primordial Spirit.\n\nYet they say,\n*\"What is this Primordial Spirit?\nIs it not that infant?\"*\n\nFrom countless eons past,\nYour sins remain unexpiated,\nObstacles unsevered,\nThe heart’s source uncleaned,\nThe nature’s root unilluminated.\n\nYou do not early repent your transgressions,\nNor change your disposition,\nNor seek a teacher to awaken to the Way—\nInstead, you waste this precious, limited time,\nChasing that shadowy infant,\nFor what purpose?",

Daoist\nReveal the infant’s form,\nManifest its luminosity?\n\nBefore they enter the *yúnquán*,\nThey do not know\nThe states of Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and gods,\nThe principles of *yīnyáng* (yin-yang),\nThe calamities and blessings of humankind,\nThe auspicious or inauspicious in the future,\nNor their year of birth or day of death.\n\nAfter they leave the *yúnquán*,\nThey still do not know.\n\nIf they do not understand their own birth and death,\nThey cannot save themselves—\nHow can they save others?\n\nIf they do not comprehend their own birth and death,\nNor discern auspicious and inauspicious,\nBound by Heaven and Earth as they are,\nTheir birth is no different from the common folk’s sufferings,\nTheir death is no different from the ordinary’s fate—\nBuried in filth, decaying in stench.\n\nThen this entering the *yúnquán* to sit in meditation,\nIs it not merely futile?\n\nAll disciples,\nYou must first forget the mind of death,\nThen enter the *yúnquán*;\nYou must first sever the ties of desire,\nThen practice sitting in meditation.\n\nWhen lustful thoughts are long extinguished,\nThe kidneys suffice,\nAnd true *lián* (lead) ascends.\n\nWhen angry thoughts are long extinguished,\nThe heart becomes void,\nAnd true *gōng* (mercury) descends.\n\nWhen diet is regulated in accordance with the seasons,\nThe spleen grows strong,\nAnd mercury and lead are sealed and fixed.\n\nWhen emotions are emptied,\nThe lungs are moistened,\nAnd when the nature is settled,\nThe liver flourishes,\nAnd the kidneys’ waters abound—\nThen the eyes shine brightly,\nAnd the pupils are like black lacquer.\n\nWhen the heart’s fire is quenched,\nThe mouth’s saliva fills,\nAnd its taste is as sweet as *lì* (fermented rice drink).\n\nWhen the spirit is pure,\nThe liver’s *qi* flows smoothly,\nAnd the sinews and bones grow light.\n\nWhen the ethereal soul is at peace,\nThe lungs’ fluids circulate,\nAnd the hair and beard turn dark.\n\nWhen the spleen is robust and the stomach harmonious,\nThe tongue and throat are agile,\nAnd the voice resounds clear.\n\nWhen the orifices are open and the blood is abundant,\nAll diseases are repelled;\nWhen the five flavors are bland,\nTrue *qi* arises.\n\nBy practicing *tāoyǐn* (guiding and pulling exercises)\nIn accordance with the four seasons and eight periods,\nYou can resist the intrusion of wind, cold, heat, and dampness.\n\nBy restraining the six desires and seven emotions,\nAnd subduing the nature to calm the mind,\nYou can ward off the influence of demons and malevolent spirits.\n\nBy seeking the Great Dao,\nTrue Knowing manifests,\nAnd the true nature is illuminated.\n\nWhen you awaken to *zhēnrú* (Suchness),\nThe physical form becomes void,\nAnd the Dharma-body is revealed.\n\nFirst save yourself,\nThen save others—\nBut ultimately, it is to save yourself.\n\nAll disciples,\nAt this stage,\nYou have only taken the first step\nThrough the great gate.\n\nThen, enter the *yúnquán* to sit in stillness,\nAscend to Heaven,\nDescend to Earth,\nAnd perceive the states of ghosts and gods,\nThe mechanisms of Heaven and Earth—\nAll within the breath’s span,\nAll within the grasp of creation.\n\nThis is all achieved through *jièdìng* (restraint and meditation).\n\nThus, when entering the *yúnquán*,\nYou are but a mortal embryo and ordinary bones;\nWhen leaving the *yúnquán*,\nYou are a sacred body and Dharma-form.\n\nUnderstanding the Great Dao,\nYour vision expands—\nYou see through all ties as illusory and false.\n\nWith a staff in hand,\nYour heart broadens—\nYou embrace Heaven and Earth within the boundless void.\n\nBefore others act, I already know;\nBefore events unfold, I foresee.\n\nOnly then is it the *liùtōng* (Six Perfections),\nWith boundless wisdom—\nAll heavenly demons bow in submission,\nAnd the Dark Protectors (*àn hù*) reverently guard.\n\nAll external paths of the ten directions submit,\nAnd all tremble in awe.\n\nWithin a sesame seed,\nThe *xūmíshān* (Sumeru Mountain) is contained—\nUnperceived.\n\nWithin a grain of millet,\nThe ten-directional worlds are hidden—\nUnknown.\n\nAt will, you roam\nThe vast Earth and mountains and rivers—\nUnfettered.\n\nAt will, you retreat\nInto the subtlest dust or grain—\nSecure.\n\nAll disciples,\nThis Dao of effortless ascent to the utmost truth is first\nIn discerning the subtle principles and awakening to Heaven’s mysteries.\n\nThus, you must abandon\nAll blind meditation, chaotic sitting,\nCooking lead and refining mercury,\nConcentrating on thoughts and visualizations,\nPurifying and transforming to aid the lost,\nSeeking official titles and records,\nShaking fans to gather *qi*,\nReciting sutras and chanting scriptures,\nMixing medicines and burning incense,\nAnd all other practices of alchemical furnaces—\nThese myriad futile affairs,\nDo not hasten to them,\nBut set them aside entirely.\n\nSincerely and earnestly,\nMake vows to Heaven,\nSwear with resolve.\n\nFrom this day onward,\nAnd into the future,\nMay you swiftly comprehend\nThe mysteries of birth and death,\nEscape the suffering of cyclic existence,\nAvoid all false paths,\nAnd attain the wondrous Dao.\n\nAh!\nThis saying of *\"avoiding all false paths\"* (*lí zhǒngzhǒng biān*)\nIs indeed the great expedient gate\nFor discerning the subtle principles and awakening to Heaven’s mysteries.\n\nAll disciples,\nWhat are these *\"false paths\"*?\n\nThey are blind meditation, chaotic sitting,\nCooking lead and refining mercury—\nAll these peripheral practices.\n\nWhat is *\"false\"*?\nPeripheral practices are neither central nor correct.\nLike a table’s edges,\nThese peripheral paths lie at the four sides—\nThey cannot enter the heart.\nEven if they enter the heart,\nThey do not leave the table.\nYet you do not realize:\nOnly by leaving the table\nCan one attain the void’s Great Dao.\nIf you cannot leave the table,\nYou remain but an object—\nNot the Dao—\nIs this not *\"false\"*?\n\n*\"False\"* means seeking (*xún*),\nIt means deviation (*xié*),\nIt means boundary (*jiè*),\nIt means shore (*yá*).\n\nPeripheral means not central,\nDeviation means not upright.\nWith boundaries,\nYou cannot be vast and boundless;\nWith shores,\nYou cannot be profound and pure.",
