Peak (浮罗之岳),*\n*within the Longsang Grove (长桑林中),*\n*received from the Heavenly Venerable (天尊)*\n*the **Lingbao Wisdom Supreme Precept Dao/Way** (灵宝智慧上品大戒法文).*\n*At that time,*\n*The Dao/Way’s Lord faced north,*\n*prostrating fivefold upon the earth,*\n*turning his heart toward the Ten Directions,*\n*then facing east and bowing.*\n*The Heavenly Venerable then told the Dao/Way’s Lord:*\n*'Now, I shall universally proclaim the Dao/Way’s sound,*\n*to awaken all beings,*\n*to resolve calamities and avert misfortunes,*\n*and to request blessings and pray for security.*\n*He who practices the Fast and follows the Dao/Way*\n*must wholeheartedly uphold the Ten Precepts (十戒),*\n*concentrate with single-minded devotion,*\n*and penetrate through profound contemplation,*\n*without allowing stray thoughts*\n*to disrupt the form and spirit.*\n*If one can do so,*\n*then they should listen in silence.*\n\n*First Precept:*\n*‘The heart shall not harbor malice or envy,*\n*nor generate dark, treacherous thoughts.*\n*One must examine their speech and repent past transgressions,*\n*and think in accordance with the Dao/Way.’*\n\n*Second Precept:*\n*‘Guard the virtue/power of benevolence without killing,*\n*pity and rescue all beings,*\n*show boundless compassion and salvation,*\n*and nourish all things with mercy.’*\n\n*Third Precept:*\n*‘Guard uprightness and yield to righteousness,*\n*avoid licentiousness and theft,*\n*constantly harbor good intentions,*\n*and sacrifice oneself to benefit others.’*\n\n*Fourth Precept:*\n*‘Avoid desire and licentiousness,*\n*let the heart not wander recklessly,*\n*maintain purity and guard with caution,*\n*and walk without blemish or stain.’*\n\n*Fifth Precept:*\n*‘Let no evil words pass the lips,*\n*nor ornate and frivolous speech,*\n*and be straight in heart and mind,*\n*committing no transgressions of speech.’*\n\n*Sixth Precept:*\n*‘Abstain from alcohol and regulate conduct,*\n*harmonize the nature and **qi** (性气),*\n*and do not harm the spirit (神).*\n*One must not offend against any evil.’*\n\n*Seventh Precept:*\n*‘Do not covet another’s superiority,*\n*nor compete for fame and rank.*\n*In all matters, one must yield and defer,*\n*and retreat to benefit others.’*\n\n*Eighth Precept:*\n*‘Do not criticize or disparage sacred scriptures,*\n*nor defame the holy texts.*\n*One must personally receive teachings with humility,*\n*and always act as though facing the divine.’\"*\n\n*[End of translation]*\n\n*Ninth Precept:*\n*'Do not slander with tongue or speech,*\n*nor analyze the faults of the four generations,*\n*and abstain from calumny, malice, envy, and jealousy,*\n*lest you harm the **qi** and spirit (神气).*\n\n*Tenth Precept:*\n*'In all actions and conduct,*\n*maintain equality and single-mindedness,*\n*so that humanity is harmonized and the divine is revered,*\n*and thus your deeds are ever upright.'*\n\n*[The following ten precepts]*\n*Can you uphold them?*\n*The assembly can uphold them.*\n\n*The Celestial Sage says:*\n*'To observe the ten precepts,*\n*each in accordance with the Heavenly Will,*\n*and to always practice great compassion,*\n*willing to deliver all beings from suffering.*\n*Be steadfast in the Sage’s teachings,*\n*never falter in the midst,*\n*and stand firm in virtue rather than transgress the Dao/Way in life.*\n\n*Thus, without retreat,*\n*you may attain the rewards of the gods,*\n*and be revered by all spirits.*\n\n*To keep long-term precepts and observe the teachings,*\n*is to personally attain liberation from the world.*\n\n*The Celestial Sage says:*\n*'The Dao/Way is noble and its teachings profound,*\n*and the human body is also precious.*\n*Thus, the Dao opens the gate of its laws,*\n*leaving precepts in scripture,*\n*to deliver the human body.*\n\n*Having delivered the human body,*\n*it aligns with the Dao—*\n*one should then refine one’s practice.*\n*To uphold precepts and observe the teachings,*\n*calm the mind and quiet the heart,*\n*clarify intentions,*\n*and single-mindedly turn toward the Way.*\n\n*With unwavering focus,*\n*purify the six **qi**-organs (六腑).*\n*Beyond the midpoint, no taste remains,*\n*and inner and outer self are clear and empty.*\n*Each alignment with nature*\n*is its own day of fasting.*\n\n*Taking incense and vowing,*\n*respond with sincerity from the heart,*\n*while the Four Celestial Kings oversee,*\n*and the Ten Departments of divine power (威神) witness—*\n*then proceed to practice,*\n*listening to the dharma’s voice,*\n*and reflecting it in your mind.*\n\n*If you uphold the precepts and walk the Dao,*\n*all merit shall be recorded in the celestial ranks,*\n*and retribution made manifest.*\n*The Dao does not fail those who diligently practice and truly receive it,*\n*so do not let demonic words (魔言) deceive you.*\n\n*The Celestial Sage declares:*\n*'To establish fasting and walk the Dao,*\n*the Four Celestial Kings,*\n*all riding cloud-chariots—*\n*the Green Palanquin (绿軿),*\n*the Eight Scenery Jade Chariot (八景玉舆)—*\n*with attendants of True Persons (真人),*\n*Jade Boys (玉童), and Jade Girls (玉女),*\n*holding floral banners,*\n*led by phoenix hymns,*\n*followed by Heaven’s white cranes and lions,*\n*singing in joyous tones,*\n*burning incense and scattering flowers,*\n*shall descend from the sky.*\n\n*To pay homage and walk the Dao,*\n*listening to the dharma’s voice.*\n*The Heavenly Kings descend,*\n*and all spirits assemble in reverence.*\n*Thus, you fulfill the Celestial Will,*\n*and fully realize the blessings of fasting—*\n*how could you not exhaust its teachings?'*\n\n*First, receive the ten precepts,*\n*then proceed to walk the Dao.*\n*Move with dignified steps,*\n*quiet the mind and ease the will.*\n*In sitting, rising, or repose,*\n*never stray from proper conduct.*\n\n*The Celestial Sage rejoices,*\n*and the assembly proclaims the lofty precepts—*\n*thus, one may say you have attained the Dao within the measure of the heart.*\n\n*[The Precept Ode]*\n*The Dao is the School of No-Mind,*\n*All deeds as fields of merit.*\n*Merit has no fixed standard,*\n*Each vow arises from the self.*\n*Emptying oneself for all beings,*\n*Focus the heart without exception.*\n*The Great Sage upholds true teachings,*\n*As rain descends from Heaven.*\n\n*High peaks are ever embraced,*\n*Yet humility endures to form the abyss.*\n*The sea is sovereign of all rivers,*\n*Yet it forgoes the dragon’s scales.*\n*Through countless kalpas, wisdom is preserved,*\n*Not merely confined to a single lifetime.*\n\n*To uphold the precepts without fail,*\n*In every life, good karma is sown.*\n*With clear thought, strive for the Great Vehicle,*\n*And you shall surely rest in the true Dao.*\n\n*[The Return to Rank]*\n*The officials sit in order,*\n*And the prohibitions and rites are proclaimed.*\n\n*The Rite of Abstinence is pure and void,*\n*The prohibitions and restraints are most solemn.*\n\n*All who partake in the abstinence,*\n*Must diligently conform to the rites and decorum.*\n\n*The Grand Master of the Supreme Polarity,*\n*Possesses all the precepts and prohibitions.*\n*Now I shall proclaim and

last moment,*\n*Nor to have any missing or improper.*\n\n*They must not drag or adjust garments not their own.*\n\n*When the Daoists mount the platform and take their seats,*\n*They must first announce to the Supervisor of Abstinence,*\n*Pay homage to the Master,*\n*Offer a single bow to the incense,*\n*And then three bows before departing.*\n*The same applies when returning.*\n\n*If, upon entering the abstinence hall,*\n*Their sandals are untidy,*\n*They must offer twenty bows in penance.*\n\n*If they rise or sit without proper order,*\n*They must offer five bows in penance.*\n\n*If

ten bows in penance.*\n\n*If they murmur or sleep while seated,*\n*They must offer five bows in penance.*\n\n*If they overturn the lamp oil,*\n*They must offer forty bows in penance.*\n\n*If their head covering or coarse robe is disheveled,*\n*They must offer ten bows in penance.*\n\n*If they recite or chant without proper decorum,*\n*They must offer twenty bows in penance.*\n\n*If they correct a transgression but conceal it,*\n*They must offer sixty bows in penance.*\n\n*If, while attending to the scriptures,*\n*They do not arrange them properly on the high seat,*\n*Or if they touch objects with neglect,*\n*They must offer ten bows in penance.*\n\n*If, while attending to the incense,*\n*The smoke is interrupted,*\n*They must offer forty bows in penance.*\n\n*If, while attending to the lamp,*\n*The flame is extinguished,*\n*They must offer twenty bows in penance.*\n\n*If they neglect their duties,*\n*And their voices are loud and harsh,*\n*They must offer fifty bows in penance.*\n\n*If, while listening to the scriptures,*\n*They lean or recline without holding the text,*\n*They must offer ten bows in penance.*\n\n*If they do not focus their minds on purity and void,*\n*And their thoughts grow sluggish,*\n*While being noticed by others,*\n*They must offer thirty bows in penance.*\n\n*If they enter or exit the abstinence hall*\n*Without announcing to the Supervisor,*\n*They must offer twenty bows in penance.*\n\n*If they let their hair hang loose or walk carelessly,*\n*They must offer twenty bows in penance.*\n\n*If, while reading the scriptures,*\n*They confuse the text or misquote upon inquiry,*\n*They must offer thirty bows in penance.*\n\n*If their chanting of the sacred hymns is discordant,*\n*They must offer twenty bows in penance.*\n\n*If, upon ascending the platform,*\n*They do not wash their hands or rinse their mouth,*\n*They must offer twenty bows in penance.*\n\n*If they rise or sit without proper

penance.*\n\n*If, while rising or departing,*\n*They do not pay homage to the scriptures,*\n*They must offer three bows in penance.*\n*If they leave directly without this,*\n*They must offer twenty bows in penance.*\n\n*If, during the incense offering,*\n*They act suddenly or rashly,*\n*They must offer ten bows in penance.*\n\n*If, while providing ritual supplies,*\n*They fail in their duties,*\n*They must offer twenty bows in penance.*\n\n*If, upon receiving the seal,*\n*They do not report it to the Supervisor,*\n*They must offer thirty bows in penance.*\n\n*If, during the abstinence rites,*\n*They flee due to matters of rest or other concerns,*\n*And are caught by others,*\n*They must offer a hundred bows in penance.*\n\n*Should any violate the rites and decorum,*\n*And refuse the correction and punishment,*\n*The offense shall be reported to the Three Treasures,*\n*And they shall be expelled from the abstinence rites.*\n\n*If the lower-ranking Master*\n*Or the officials neglect their duties,*\n*From one to three offenses,*\n*They shall be corrected according to the rules.*\n*For offenses beyond three,*\n*They shall be expelled from the abstinence rites.*\n\n*Should one who corrects neglect to admonish,*\n*They shall share the same guilt as the offender.*\n\n*If the senior Master neglects their duties,*\n*From one to three offenses,*\n*They shall be corrected according to the rules.*\n*For offenses beyond three,*\n*Their merit shall be forfeited for a hundred days,*\n*And they shall not again ascend to the ritual seat.*\n\n*All these prohibitions and rites,*\n*Are decrees from the Mystic Capital’s Upper Palace,*\n*And follow the ancient established codes.*\n\n*As for their indolence or negligence,*\n*And any transgressions committed,*\n*At the time of establishing the abstinence,*\n*The Four Celestial Kings, the Heavenly Sovereign, and the Supreme Saints,*\n*Shall descend in person to the site,*\n*Gaze upon the rituals and conduct,*\n*Observe their sincerity and resolve.*\n*Should any offense be found,*\n*They shall immediately command the Four Officials and Five Celestial Kings,*\n*And decree to the Three Departments,*\n*To correct and admonish according to the offense,*\n*And impose their retributions.*\n\n*The Heavenly Sovereign, the Great Sage,*\n*Out of compassion for the ignorant of the world,*\n*Does not wish to impose severe censure,*\n*Thus opening the door of correction and punishment.*\n*So that they may know their faults and mend their ways,*\n*And their sins shall thereby be absolved.*\n\n*Those who receive punishment,*\n*Must accept blame with humility,*\n*And obey with reverence,*\n*Not daring to disguise their faults or contend,*\n*Nor to provoke the sacred spirit.*\n\n*Thus shall the sacred order be upheld,*\n*And the calamities of guilt be dispelled.*\n*Guilt shall be cast aside in the past,*\n*And blessings shall extend into the future.*\n\n*With utmost vigilance and devotion,*\n*Diligently and fearfully guard against transgression.*\n*If one personally serves the Great Sage,*\n*And bows before the Most Honorable,*\n*Then the sacred spirit shall be moved,*\n*And blessings and auspiciousness shall gather.*\n\n*May all who ascend the platform*\n*Strive earnestly to observe these prohibitions.*\n*The Golden Seal of the Great Abstinence—*\n*Completing the Rite of Abstinence and the Declaration of Precepts.*",
