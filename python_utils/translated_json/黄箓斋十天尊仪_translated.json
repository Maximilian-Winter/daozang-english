and effect, we now meet in fortune,\nAnd the departed souls take flight toward the realm of rebirth.\n\nIn harmony with the inconceivable merit.\n\nThe extolling of virtues has been fully completed.\nI offer the departed souls,\nThat they may be reborn in the immortal realm.\n\nI humbly pray to behold the Heavenly Lord’s wondrous form,\nAnd rely upon the Dao’s boundless grace.\nAscending to the immortal realm,\nTo wander freely and at ease.\n\nMay blessings extend to both the living and the departed,\nAnd benefit all who exist.\nAll sentient beings alike may ascend to the Dao’s shore.\n\n**The Yellow Talisman Rite for the Ten Heavenly Lords’ Ceremony is concluded.**",
