  "full_translation": "**The Collected Realizations of Awakening**\n\n**Title:** *The Collected Realizations of Awakening* (*Wuzhen Ji*). Compiled by Li Tongxuan of the Jin Dynasty. Two scrolls. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Taiping* Section.\n\n**Scroll One of *The Collected Realizations of Awakening***\n*Collected by Master Li, the Permeating Mystery Man of Brocade Screen Mountain*\n\n**Song of Burning the Medicine Bag**\nMedicine bag, medicine bag—detached from my elbow,\nFor twenty years you’ve been my knowing friend.\nAt times you’ve clothed me in silks and satins,\nAt times you’ve drowned me in wine and flowers.\nThrough countless households, rich and poor alike,\nNo day or hour passed without your tread at my door.\nYou’ve muddled the wellspring of glory,\nBewildered the inch of the pulse,\nPiling disaster upon disaster with reckless moxa and needles.\nFor you, I’ve accumulated merit and practiced arts in vain;\nThrough you, disputes and karmic debts have arisen.\nToday I burn you without hesitation,\nFor my heart is no longer what it once was.\nThe medicine bag, engulfed in flame, unleashes divine might,\nIts roar like thunder shaking the heavens.\nCompared to the scalding broth I once offered you,\nYou now repent—your body and mind struck first.\nThe source of fortune clears,\nThe root of sin decays.\nLeaping free, I shed this mortal husk.\nBarrier mountains rise a thousand fathoms, their peaks piercing clouds,\nThe bitter sea surges a thousand leagues, its waves clashing with the stars.\nThe Dao of Heaven is lofty—how lofty is it?\nThe Dao of Earth is deep—how deep is it?\nEarth has its apertures, Heaven its ladder,\nSun and moon alternate in brightness, undisturbed by dusk or dawn.\nAzure clouds and white qi intertwine in purity,\nBlack mists and crimson vapors swirl within the void.\nAt the center they merge, forming a radiant treasure,\nIts light piercing straight through the azure heavens.\nThe original form, the wondrous body, delights in this life,\nOne with the Great Void, boundless and eternal.\n\n**Song of the Tarnished Mirror**\nAlas, tarnished mirror! Alas, tarnished mirror!\nIts pure body cannot withstand the dust’s clinging grasp.\nThough sturdy in its bronze form,\nIts face and features are no longer bright compared to its first state.\nThe shape remains round as before,\nYet within, the luminous nature of roundness is obscured.\nTo apply the wondrous medicine and polish it anew,\nWashing away the filth and stains of the past—\nThe whole body, transparent and unobstructed, becomes resplendent,\nRevealing the crookedness of others.\nSealed in a jade casket, hidden deep in the grotto chamber,\nIt remains eternally pure, enduring as heaven and earth.\n\n**Song of Awakening to Futile Toil**\nAwakening to futile toil! Awakening to futile toil!\nOnce awakened, I gladly partake of coarse fare and pickled dregs.\nThe hues of Mount Shouyang harbor vain resentment,\nThe waves of the Miluo River churn with empty rage.\nTen battles won, the sword beheads the chieftain,\nOne act of defiance, the blade carves out the heart.\nThe ancients, unknowing, met such calamities—\nWhy do men of today, though aware, still suffer them?\nWhat is clear may be displayed,\nWhat is hidden may be concealed.\nTo know the difficulty yet not retreat—fools indeed!\nBurning the corpse, swallowing charcoal—thrice ponder the folly,\nDiscarding the gourd, burying the dice—a single move excels.\nWe, the mediocre and dull,\nDrape ourselves in blue and purple, strutting as heroes.\nSwiftly decide to gather the Three Treasures,\nLest delay turn your hair to frost.\nAwaken within the dream,\nEscape beyond the world.\nLight furs and silk sashes exchanged for hempen robes,\nA gaunt frame of seven feet, tapping a dragon-headed staff,\nA thread of complexion three spans long, binding a tiger’s sash.\nWide sleeves sweep open the path of no affairs,\nStraw sandals tread through the prison of attachments.\nIn the Hall of Eternal Light, golden millet is sown,\nIn the Garden of Vital Qi, jade paste is cultivated.\nThe chicken transforms into a phoenix,\nThe carp becomes a turtle.\nThe resolve to cultivate the Dao soars beyond the clouds.\nVoices ascend to the crimson towers, proclaiming the Way,\nResounding like immortal birds crying in the nine marshes.\n\n**Song of the Rustic Fool**\nThe Two Modes, high and deep, form a wondrous pair,\nFrom them, the myriad things are born and take shape.\nAmong the myriad things, none is nobler than man,\nYet how few among men can guard their noble essence?\nYesterday, I sighed for this life of mine,\nNeither disgraced nor honored, thanks to Heaven’s protection.\nI too have gathered and scattered with heroes,\nUnburdened by hunger or cold, free from the dust of the world.\nNow, old and withered in this former frame,\nI deeply resent the mockery of fools who call me rustic.\nDeaf and blind, half-witted and dull,\nLame and hunchbacked, my mouth sealed against profit.\nI dare not speak idly to others,\nYet when I utter loyal words, they benefit knowing friends.\nThe Jade Pond churns, turning the eight elixirs,\nWatering the rootless tree to immortality.\nOthers scramble in busyness, possessing nothing within,\nWhile my livelihood arises from nothingness.\nBe it deep night or bright day,\nIn sitting, lying, dwelling, or walking, I forget the body’s inquiry.\nSilent and serene, I settle without ceasing,\nTurning the celestial wheel, operating the mechanism’s mortar.\nEarth’s qi surges,\nHeaven’s rain pours,\nFilling rivers and seas, suffusing the cosmos.\nTortoises follow serpents in racing pursuit,\nTigers roar and dragons bellow in fierce embrace.\nLofty pavilions and jade-towered halls rise in splendor,\nThe cavern of Mount Jing resounds with the howling of numinous winds.\nRiding this wind, I ascend back to the Great Void,\nPiercing through the Gate of Heaven in a crashing breakthrough.\nFragrant clouds, laden with fragrance, cradle the moon’s glow,\nAuspicious mists, drifting and dense, shroud the stars.\nDo not say the path of cultivation is not arduous—\nTo resent others’ ignorance is itself a grievous error.\nIf you have not yet arrived, vow to arrive,\nIf you have not yet attained, resolve to attain.\nOffer the incense of a vast and uncluttered heart,\nBeseeching the immortal masters for eternal companionship.\n\n**Song of Lament for Not Recognizing Nature and Life**\nTo cultivate without recognizing the true empty nature\nIs like polishing a tarnished mirror in a vat of glue and lacquer.\nExhausting effort in endless polishing,\nYet in the end, clarity and brightness remain elusive.\nTrue empty nature! True empty nature!\nWithout color or sound, beyond sight or hearing.\nHidden or manifest, the void is not truly void—\nSeek it and it cannot be seen, call it and it responds.\nTo cultivate the Dao without recognizing the true original life\nIs like plucking leaves to seek branches, forcing a door’s hinge.\nEmpty sprouts may grow, but they bear no fruit,\nNeglecting the primal essence, the fruit remains unproven.\nTrue original life! True original life!\nThe Supreme Ultimate divides its form, becoming the root’s handle.\nWithin the effortless transformations of the myriad things,\nSurpassing creation’s work, one may become a sage.\nTo cultivate only life, not nature,\nIs like adorning a stubborn chime with black gold—\nShatter the stubborn form, and it falls into emptiness,\nYet one remains mired in the quagmire of void and purity.\nTo cultivate only nature, not life,\nIs like water and fire failing to merge, like scorched rice—\nLife incomplete, nature unreal,\nStubborn emptiness drifts through the yin realms.\nCultivate both nature and life,\nEmerging from delusion’s illness.\nWhen nature and life are both complete, the mystery deepens,\nIn one leap, far removed from the wheel’s endless path.\n\n**Song of Lament for Worldly Acquaintances**\nThe Primal Simplicity scatters, bequeathing forms to things,\nThings perish and arise, driven by cold and heat.\nThe world knows peace and strife, portents of human karma,\nEmotions mourn and rejoice, affairs unite and part.\nWith body and nature, we come, yet remain obscured,\nLives long or short, we depart, still lost in confusion.\n\nThrough this awakening, I distance myself from harm,\nDwelling idly in a humble lane, my heart remains unshackled.\nA year passes like a fleeting gap—spring and autumn shift,\nA day turns in an instant—sunlight and twilight drift.\n\nBamboo fence and thatched hut—here I roam free,\nAmid the fields of fame and ranks of gain, who knows honor or disgrace?\nThe clamor of right and wrong, like battling ants—why discern?\nThe misty isles of Penglai—this alone may be sought.\n\nThe Great Dao of non-action—even ghosts and spirits revere,\nUttermost truth, most profound—heaven and earth bear witness.\n*Song of Lament for the Lack of a Knowing Friend*\nDaoist livelihood—hard for men to find,\nEven if one appears, he labors at other arts.\nChasing names, seeking profit, his outward guise seems stern,\nLost in words, clinging to doctrines, his inner work is forfeit.\n\nThe Dao’s essence is subtle, virtue’s function is veiled,\nContention leaves but bare branches—empty, still.\nSpeak, yet do not speak—others remain deluded,\nWorry, yet only for your own shortcomings.\n\nHave you not seen?\nA thousand streams, ten thousand waves—though their forms differ,\nThose who grasp source and flow ultimately return to one.\nHave you not seen?\nDivergent paths, varied trails—each step diverges,\nYet those who know the tracks and ruts share the same awakening.\n\nExpand and uphold your original nature,\nEmbodying the perfect clarity of motion and stillness;\nNurture and sustain your true life,\nUnraveling the transformations of heaven and earth.\n\nFacing the wall in silent sitting, I seek the legacy of Bodhidharma;\nReclining at ease, I follow the fragrant traces of Master Xiyi.\nWhen nature settles and life abides,\nOne attains the spontaneity of the profound and obscure;\nIn crystalline meditation,\nThe subtle workings of the numinous source are revealed.\n\nAt times, in dreams, I enter grotto-heavens,\nOr soar freely in flight;\nNow a Jade Maiden bears ambrosia,\nNow a Golden Youth offers aid.\nThough the Three Thousand Merits remain unfulfilled,\nMy name is inscribed in the register of the Nine-Turned Golden Elixir.\nOne day, when perfection is complete,\nMy merit will be recorded in the annals of immortals.\n\nTo hear and act upon this is to penetrate principle with certainty;\nFor those who earnestly receive the teaching, delusion shatters in an instant.\nSincere counsel—heed it well,\nLest habit and procrastination waste your days in vain.\nWhen the mirror of nature dims, polish it anew,\nWhen the lamp of the heart flickers, tend it diligently.\n\nPreserve your qi-essence, refine the spirit-fluid,\nSow in the morning, reap by evening—know this yourself.\nThe mystery within this gateway is true cultivation;\nIf not cultivated here, where else shall it be sought?\n\nRound eloquence on the tongue, yet the heart remains untouched—\nOutwardly genuine, inwardly false, mere street-corner adornment.\nHave you not heard?\nWhen Ziqi perished, Boya’s zither fell silent;\nWhen Zhang Hua passed, who wielded the peerless sword?\n\nOnce summoned to serve,\nA single mat in a square chamber,\nMy body, coiled like a cushion, knows no constraint,\nAs boundless as tumbleweed drifting to the ends of the earth.\nMay I meet a kindred spirit to speak of concealment and revelation,\nExhaling rainbow mists, pouring out the depths of my heart.\n\n*Song for a Daoist Friend Stricken by Grievous Illness*\nAlas, alas—this bodily frame!\n\nOnce born—why then must you die?\nOnce unborn—why come to be?\nIs it you who peddled your head in haste?\nOr I who loved to plunge into rebirth?\n\nO dung-coffin, dung-coffin, bear me back in defeat.\nThis time cast aside, all dragged away, all buried deep.\nNo need to pour libations before the painted casket,\nNo need to seek mourners’ banners or dirge-bearers’ sway.\n\nThe noble praise, the base deride—\nA farcical play to dispatch the body’s go-between.\nHeart earnest, mouth laughing,\nTrivial human courtesies arrayed like fish in ranks.\n\nThe angler casts his line, heedless of the hookless bait;\nHe gathers his rod and descends the fishing platform’s height.\nEternal winds brush sleeves of purity,\nA single moon illumines Penglai’s isle.\n\n*Song Bequeathed to Disciples*\nSummon my disciples, hear these faithful words I leave:\nWhen I am sick, seek no physician’s art;\nWhen I depart, shed no tears to grieve.\nThe three-inch true qi is gone,\nThe four limbs are but corpse’s sinew and bone.\n\nSend me off without a painted coffin’s hue,\nChoose no grave by yin-yang divination’s view.\nAsk not the hour’s fortune or ill,\nBut seat me in the valley of clouds and mist.\n\nCease the funeral board’s display,\nLet kin’s gifts lie idle, unused.\nIf blameless, dwell in heaven or among men;\nIf guilty, descend to hell’s abyss.\n\nSeek not the mercy of the worthy and sage,\nFear not the clans of ghosts and gods.\nShould you rely on eulogies and chants,\nThe sins of this cast-off form remain unredeemed.\n\nThere is a mechanism beyond the dust—\nPrepare in advance the blessings of true cultivation.\n\n*Seven-Character Regulated Verse: Expressing My Feelings*\n\nThe mind at leisure stands serene and high,\nWith coarse hemp robes and simple fare, all worldly hues defy.\nWhen eyes grow weary, I lay aside the half-unrolled scroll,\nWhen hands grow slack, I leave the broken lute strings whole.\n\nMy heart finds rest in poetry’s unpaid debt,\nMy joy needs no coin to buy the wine I fret.\nTo stretch or bend, I follow fate’s decree,\nLike drifting duckweed or tumbleweed, I pass the years with glee.\n\nContent in poverty, my patched robe thin,\nI fear no biting wind that chills the bone within.\nToo lazy even to wash my face each day,\nToo idle for my fingers to fasten hair in array.\n\nOn stone bed’s coolness, sleep is sweet and deep,\nIn cotton nest’s soft warmth, I sit and wake from sleep.\nBeyond this flesh, my heart and soul take flight,\nThe storm may rage, yet leaves me undisturbed in light.\n\n*Self-Joy*\n\nThe world is bound in profit’s chains and fame’s tight tether,\nYet I, though poor, rejoice in tranquil leisure’s weather.\nMy mind’s pure realm holds wonders manifold,\nWhile red dust’s whirls beyond me ebb and flow untold.\n\nNo need to vie by plunging in the stream,\nNo need to hide on Shang’s peaks to dream.\nBeneath the willow’s shade, my rope-bed sways,\nIn silent stillness, dawn to dusk I spend my days.\n\n*Admonition to the Multitude*\n\nWith heart at ease, my spirit calm and clear,\nI sing wild songs, then sing again to cheer.\nMagic herbs draw earth’s qi to bloom,\nCelestial nectar flows through heaven’s loom.\n\nCut worldly thoughts to keep the immortal’s creed,\nDrive off the poetry demon—let Dao’s demon lead.\nIf you grasp these demons’ meaning true,\nYou’ll outdo even me in madness too.\n\n*Good and Evil*\n\nGood and evil both arise from one same source,\nYet their uses differ in their course.\nKind words should fall like rain that nurtures flowers,\nAnger’s gusts should not be winter’s icy powers.\n\nBy the phoenix’s house, old willows stand,\nBeyond the tiger’s den, melons grow in the land.\nThe sages of old were not without their wit,\nYet they forgot all words to find joy in poverty’s pit.\n\n*Warning Against Harming the Multitude*\n\nThe tongue may sweetly scent, the belly foully reek,\nSuch friendships drag men down to ruin’s deep.\nFair faces dare not break the precept’s hold,\nCunning words betray the caution’s code untold.\n\nWhen deceitful thoughts arise, heart and mouth divide,\nWhen lying lips part, the mouth betrays the heart inside.\nCease not in schemes to always win the fight,\nFor when defeat arrives, calamity runs deep as night.\n\n*Diligent Cultivation*\n\nAwakened to truth, leave the Five Lakes behind,\nWith heart resolved, no need to roam the mountains blind.\nWithin the rise and fall of heaven and earth’s span,\nThe clouds and rain are drawn in breath’s ebb and flow’s plan.\n\nRefine the Five Phases to forge the Three Fields’ treasure,\nCommand the myriad changes to return the Nine Qi’s measure.\nThis six-foot frame holds no fixed form,\nWhy then should aught disturb my calm?\n\n*Idle Days: Expressing My Feelings*\n\nWillows by the gate, pines in the yard where melons grow,\nAn alchemy furnace, scriptures—this old life’s tableau.\nStartled by the crow’s cry knocking on the fragrant tree,\nAt ease, I lure the wandering bees to wildflowers free.\n\nMy sleeves dance in the wind as I turn and sway,\nMy hairpin leans on stone, my cap sits askew all day.\nIf someone asks where I make my abode,\nI smile and point to the clouds where my home is bestowed.\n\n*To Master Zhang on the Unity of the Dao*\n\nThe Great Dao is non-action, nature’s own way,\nThrough Chan’s semblance, true Chan comes to stay.\nNature fuses with form, beyond all divide,\nLife knocks on yin and yang, where inversion and truth abide.\n\nWind stirs beneath my feet, my body wings the earth,\nThe moon shines at my head, my back grinds the sky’s girth.\nWho would believe that from nothing, all things arise?\nPhoenix and crane soar freely, needing no whip’s guise.\n\n*Seeing Master Zhang Off to Shaanxi*\n\nA recluse beyond the world is seldom met,\nWith joy in greeting, sorrow in parting—endless fret.\nYour virtue’s light scatters like rain on Qin’s plain,\nYour Dao’s qi lingers like wind in Jin’s domain.\n\nToday we laugh and talk in shared delight,\nIn future times, who knows if we’ll reunite?\nBeyond the clouds and mist, in the immortals’ land,\nWill this old man of drifting fate still stand?\n\n*Admonition Against Weariness of Worldly Toil*\n\nWorldly toil should serve as awakening’s gate,\nYet toil itself breeds weariness and endless want’s weight.\nEach act of crafting leaves the heart remorseful, sore,\nA hundred thoughts bring hardship, grief to the core.\n\nThe seven po souls scatter with karmic seeds,\nThe three hun souls are stolen by sleep’s thieving deeds.\nIf you grasp this truth for cultivation’s art,\nWhen will you ever board the Dharma’s ship to start?\n\n*Exhortation to the Unawakened*\n\nBefore sealing the Five Passes, how can you refine the Nine Returns?\nVainly you fast to quell disputes, seek herbs to keep youth’s burns.\nThe Five Phases never leave yin and yang’s shell,\nThe Two Things are bound within creation’s spell.\nIf you comprehend the principle of non-action, formless and free,\nYou’ll find joy in idleness, neither near nor far from thee.\n\n*Admonition Against Indulging in Books*\n\nTo gather dusty thoughts in furrowed brows is vain,\nFor gain and loss have ever been a forked lane.\nA thousand ancient tomes the scholars may explain,\nBut only Daoists know the immortal’s scene’s domain.\nIn youth, experience the world’s affairs,\nIn prime, seek the Great Dao’s base.\nI warn the clever: discern early, be wise,\nLest wit turn to folly in your eyes.\n\n*Mourning Master Wei*\n\nAll day I mourn you, touching your cloud-coffin’s side,\nAt last you’ve realized the Perfect Truth’s pure guide.\nThe cicada sheds its golden husk, soars to the azure sky,\nThe crane returns to the purple palace, its jade nest cold on high.\n\nDelighting in wind and moon above the three heavens’ height,\nYour lofty standard stands for all to see through time’s long night.\nI call again to the Daoist friends of Penglai’s isle,\nYet when we’ll meet again, who knows? The phoenix waits awhile.\n\n*To Master Wang, Who Turned from the Dao to Scholarship*\n\nYou’ve pored over the Three Tombs, pondered the Nine Thoughts’ maze,\nYet in the end, your plans fell short, your toil brought scant praise.\nBetter to follow Confucius’ Four Dhyānas’ way,\nOr honor Lü’s Hundred-Character Poem each day.\n\nWhen the Seven Returns and Nine Cycles’ work is done,\nWhen the Three Vehicles’ One Perfection’s course is run,\nBeneath the azure sky, the bright moon clears the heart,\nHow I envy your success, your laurel branch’s art!\n\n*Early Winter’s Feelings*\n\nAutumn’s light has faded, winter follows fast,\nThe Northern Emperor’s work brings chill at last.\nWhite grass fills the three paths, intertwined,\nCrimson clouds darken as the six-petaled snow is twined.\n\nAwaken to truth—alas, too late the call,\nBegin to cultivate—too slow, the fall.\nI sigh for the drifting red leaves’ flight,\nFor returning to the origin is like entering the kiln’s light.\n\n*Snow*\n\nThe crimson clouds gather as if by fate,\nThe wind drives the flying snow to every state.\nReed banks and islets share the silver hue,\nWild trees and plum blossoms wear the same white view.\n\nI begrudge Sun Gong’s night beyond the window pane,\nI resent Han Qi’s snow before his horse’s mane.\nBy the tea’s warmth, the smoke curls, no other care,\nI speak of immortal flowers on the leaves laid bare.\n\n*On the Beginning and End of Cultivation*\n\nDeluded disciples seek the Daoist’s way,\nRefine pure yang to perfection, then stay.\nA three-foot sack holds boundless delight,\nA single staff sweeps all sorrow away.\n\nGreen mountains invite—dwell in ease,\nGreen waters beckon—roam with grace.\nIf a guest asks where my path leads,\nI smile in silence, point to the clouds’ embrace.\n\n**In Response to Wang Zhiyin’s \"Early Spring\"**\n\nThe alchemy of creation knows renewal’s art,\nThe cauldron’s fresh spring glows with radiant heart.\nWarblers ascend to lofty boughs on soft breeze,\nSwallows near nests find the sun’s slow reprise.\n\nHalf-rain, half-shine—peach blossoms bare their face,\nLight chill, light warmth—willows unfurl with grace.\nEach year we meet, each year we age anew,\nFor whom do white hairs toil, and fame accrue?\n\n**Admonishing a Friend Moved by Spring**\n\nWhy grieve, my friend, at spring’s return in vain?\nWhat sorrow lurks where spring’s own light doth reign?\nEach year we greet, each year we bid adieu,\nA hundred pass, and all must fade from view.\n\nOld sins dissolve in verdant knots anew,\nLest future lives be lost to deeds we rue.\nA hand’s span holds the bliss of paradise,\nYet few unlock its gates to wander twice.\n\n**Heaven’s Dao in Harmonious Spring**\n\nThe Way unfolds in spring’s unhurried turn,\nHeaven and Earth in balanced concord burn.\nRoots gilded lie within the Five Phases’ mold,\nSprouts nurtured thrive where twin qi’s warmth is told.\n\nFlutes trill in painted towers on whispers light,\nHooves clatter on purple paths through misted night.\nYet mark: all fruit succeeds the bloom’s embrace,\nAnd strength is rooted deep in steadfast base.\n\n**The Inexorable Push of Impermanence**\n\nGrim specters drive, relentless in their claim,\nA thousand gold won’t buy a fleeting name.\nThe rich will never bear the poor man’s plight,\nNor can tomorrow grasp today’s last light.\n\nDeserted crimson towers, courtyards still,\nEndless black mists at the ghostly gate’s chill.\nOh, how the bitter grief wells up anew—\nAll born from loves that once our hearts once knew.\n\n**Admonition Against Wine**\n\nSince ancient days, men curse old Du Kang’s brew,\nYet still they drink, though ruin it may strew.\nIt rots the liver, sears the lungs with pain,\nTorments the gut—no cure, no balm, no gain.\n\nIt stirs the waves that drown the soul’s fair stream,\nA scalding bath that shames the waking dream.\nI urge you: drink, but never to excess,\nFor though it spares none, harm begins with self.\n\n**Lament for Calamities of Flood and Drought**\n\nWhen yin and yang in heaven’s breath misalign,\nMankind’s own sins the wrath of nature twine.\nThe poor dissemble, knaves deceive and cheat,\nThe rich grow wanton, nobles haughty greet.\n\nSummer’s chill freezes, winter’s heat oppresses,\nRain turns to drought, and drought to barren stresses.\nFamine breeds plague, yet heaven stays unkind,\nNo mercy shown for deeds of humankind.\n\n**To Master Liu After Long Parting**\n\nA decade passed since last your face I knew,\nYet longing lingers, etched in heart’s deep hue.\nThough fine days come, old songs we may reprise,\nNo breeze now bears the verses I devise.\n\nThough dreams may bring you near, words fail to reach,\nOur bodies part, yet minds remain in each.\nHow oft at crossroads grief has torn my breast—\nSoft spring winds blow, the sun lingers west.\n\n**To Master Zhang**\n\nYou dwell in western hills, bound by duty’s chain,\nNo word from you, no crane-borne news to gain.\nBody and mind drift like spring’s floating down,\nFootsteps wander like autumn’s tumbling brown.\n\nThe Six Repositories stay pure, untouched by dust,\nThe Three Isles’ paths lie veiled in mist and rust.\nTake one step on the clouds—lest slumber claim,\nAnd time reduce you to a hoary frame.\n\n**Early Summer Rain at Hejin**\n\nSummer’s first rains enrich the farmer’s store,\nNo boast of plenty—yet abundance’s door.\nMulberry boughs half-crimson, fragrant, bright,\nCherries near ripe, cradled in crimson light.\n\nPeppercorns swell in courtyards front and back,\nWheat blooms in fields both north and south’s expanse.\nThrough emerald willows, verdant locusts’ shade,\nThe spinning wheels hum on without a pause.\n\n**Summer Day in a Mountain Hall**\n\nThe mountain hall lies still in summer’s deep,\nA draught of coolness cleanses dust to sleep.\nI loosen robes to sit on riverside stone,\nLean on my staff to walk where willows’ shade has grown.\n\nI pluck wild blooms to lure the butterflies,\nStrike bamboo hard to startle birds that rise.\nEnthralled by clouds, I draw the boy’s mocking laugh—\nUnseen, the sun now dips to western half.\n\n**Passing the Days**\n\nDrifting, drifting through the fleeting hours,\nI seek no fame, nor chase the gnat-like powers.\nBy night, I tend the furnace’s threefold flame,\nBy dawn, I pluck the zither’s tranquil claim.\n\nThe cuckoo’s cry shatters the dream of Hua Xu,\nThe Qi maiden’s call rouses the meditative view.\nWho knows the art of this unhurried life?\nTo forge white jade and mold it into gold.\n\n**To Master Chen, the Preceptor**\n\nSince parting, your abode seems lost in mist,\nMy thoughts take flight like crows to southern tryst.\nMists veil the winding streams in layered gray,\nClouds mirror peaks that rise and fall away.\n\nThe inkstone gathers dust, its sheen now dim,\nNo guests cross the gate, barred since dawn’s first hymn.\nI shift my seat on rush mat, staff in hand,\nGaze north, stroke my beard, and long to ascend.\n\n**Farewell to Marshal Shi**\n\nOur bond was bright, our joy in life complete,\nYet honor’s weight and shame brought fear to meet.\nThough weak my arm to steer the chariot’s wheel,\nMy throat still holds the rooster’s clarion peal.\n\nIn speech, we shared the fire of loyalty,\nIn word, our trust grew ever steadfastly.\nI point to fine days, hoping we may meet,\nBut life and death deny our hearts’ deceit.\n\n**Expressing My Feelings**\n\nWhy bow the head or bend the knee in vain?\nGreen hills and clouds—no distant path to gain.\nOld pines defy the frost’s unyielding bite,\nUncut jade fears no furnace’s fierce light.\n\nThe cock’s crow carries three leagues’ sound,\nThe crane’s call pierces ninefold heaven’s ground.\nForgotten, fame and shame—what joy remains?\nTo hold the Dao, wear cap and crown, in silence reigns.\n\n**Seeking Master Chen, the Preceptor Afar**\n\nMy soles grow calloused, drenched in sweat like rain,\nYet undeterred, I seek my friend again.\nFor righteousness, I’d bear a mountain’s weight,\nFor kindness, plumb the seas’ uncharted state.\n\nThe idler’s nature grinds the guest’s resolve,\nThe sage’s heart the sage’s heart evolves.\nUpon the mat, the wind’s high price I pay—\nOne smile repays a debt of thousand gold.\n\n**Warning: Power’s Transience**\n\nAffairs of men know rise and fall’s decree,\nWinter departs, spring comes eternally.\nWaves churn to ripples, then disperse in air,\nClouds veil the rain, then hide the sun’s bright glare.\n\nThe future points—its term is nearly spent,\nThe past, once turned to, nowhere can be bent.\nI lie and dream of east winds at noon’s height—\nAwake, the red sun sinks in western light.\n\n**Admonishing a Monk’s Arrogance**\n\nYour laughter, monk, in robes, goes much too far,\nEven if supreme—what then? What avatar?\nWith words you carve out pits and trenches deep,\nWith tongue you weave the nets that others keep.\n\nThe mirror’s tarnish lingers, still you stain,\nThe bag’s sharp awl is honed to cut again.\nThough you may clutch the jade of Jing Mountain’s core,\nWho dares to ask, lest none know its true lore?\n\n**Self-Lament**\n\nWhite-haired, capped, an old Daoist I remain,\nLife’s grace has granted me a carefree reign.\nToday I shun the shells of others’ guise,\nTomorrow I’ll be free—no need for lies.\n\nAt seventy, few survive; at sixty, rare,\nThree thousand fruits of immortality—\nTwo thousand years to cultivate with care.\n\n**Yesterday’s Errors, Today’s Truth**\n\nYesterday’s errors, today’s truth—life’s journey done,\nInspired, I sing; weary, I rest.\n\n**Visiting a Friend on the Double Ninth in the Cold**\n\nOn the Double Ninth, wind stirs the leaves with a mournful sigh,\nCold’s bite pierces my tattered robe.\nMy flesh bristles with the chill’s sharp sting,\nMy teeth chatter as I chant poems to greet the noble.\nI bear a thousand verses, deep in intent,\nYet he plucks not a single hair in return.\nWorse still, reckless friends show no pity—\nThey rap my gate with staffs, calling me to climb the heights.\n\n**Master Pei’s Transcendence**\n\nLast night, golden youths bore a decree in my dream,\nThis morn, Master Pei ascends as an immortal.\nHis spirit, unbound, returns to truth,\nHis fourfold form, dignified, remains serene.\nWith dragon’s might, he leaps into the sea isles,\nWith crane’s strength, he soars to the heavens’ net.\nFrom this day forth, cultivators of truth—\nFew may stand beside him.\n\n**Lamenting the End of Worldly Ambition**\n\nOnce I played the gallant, learned the ways of the world,\nNow old, all things fade—nothing remains.\nFame and gain flow away like water,\nRight and wrong are swept up with falling blossoms.\nI grow weary of wind and moon, shun poetry circles,\nFear the madness of wine, avoid the taverns.\nIf guests speak of honor and disgrace,\nI seal my lips and shake my head.\n\n**Admonishing Disciples on My Aspirations**\n\nDrunk on elixirs outside my thatched hut,\nI wander a realm apart, proving my skill.\nA crimson dragon I ride, steady through golden gates,\nA dark crane supports me as I mount the jade flask.\nWhen the myriad changes settle, the Three Realms grow still,\nThe nine heavens’ clear sun stands alone.\nHow many cultivators of truth know this?\nHave they grasped this family’s way?\n\n**Warning the World**\n\nIn troubled times, straight ministers’ plans go unused,\nKnowing the glue-pot’s trap, why risk shaving your head?\nHan, Marquis of Yunmeng, was slain though blameless,\nBai Qi of Du’ou was imprisoned despite his merit.\nBeneath the green pines, temples stand high and low,\nBy fragrant grassy banks, new and old graves lie.\nLook to the steles—observe their fates:\nNot one meets the heart’s desire.\n\n**Exhorting the Worldly to Know Their Limits**\n\nThe world’s eyes struggle to glimpse the Daoist’s path,\nYet within, a wondrous mechanism turns.\nOne loss: the bright moon, pure in mid-heaven,\nTwo gains: the spirit’s light, gathered within.\nHexagrams’ lines, long or short, mend and split,\nFire and water of bing and geng ebb and flow.\nWhen spring thunder shakes the vast expanse,\nThe pure body roams freely to heaven’s end.\n\n**Having Failed to Achieve Fame and Success**\n\nI saw ambition would not bear fruit,\nSo I returned—honor and shame no longer surprise me.\nWithin, I gather my pupils, cease gazing at forms,\nWithout, I lock my tongue, make no sound.\nMy heart is still as a half-pole of pond water,\nMy body drifts like a wisp of wild cloud.\nRecalling past affairs, I laugh to the sky—\nNearly trapped by empty blossoms for a lifetime.\n\n**To My Disciples: The Master’s Study of Books**\n\nWhy does the master shun his thatched hut,\nShunning the Dao to cling to the Confucians?\nGreedily he covets the Three Rites on his shelves,\nHeedless of the seven treasures in his flask.\nFiercely he scolds those who seek glory and gain,\nUnknowing of the effortless work of contention.\nHis aged frame, his ailing eyes draw near—\nSurely he sighs, lamenting his folly.\n\n**Admonishing the Stubborn**\n\nTo learn the Dao, first be steadfast and firm,\nBut stubbornness makes you a tyrant.\nXiangru yielded the road, forgetting his pride,\nLian Po bore the thorns, begging forgiveness.\nHarmony’s gentlest breath pierces the earth,\nA spring’s weak flow cuts through high ridges.\nTo be humble is to gain—never faulted,\nTo defy the crowd is to court great misfortune.\n\n**Self-Delight**\n\nI break earth’s net, strike heaven’s gate,\nRide a flying dragon at will.\nMy eyes know this as utmost bliss,\nMy seat reveals Penglai’s peak.\nThe sun and moon rush on, let them speed,\nMy true nature abides in tranquil ease.\nWhat is done or undone—why heed it?\nLet white hair laugh with abandon.\n\n**Inquiring of My Daoist Brothers on the Dharma**\n\nAsk not of your heart’s affairs—why fret?\nTo truly cultivate, you must meet truth.\nLet the teaching rain wash the filth from your heart,\nLet the Dao’s wind scatter the dust from your eyes.\nOne flask transforms dreams within dreams,\nThe Three Realms fly with bodies beyond bodies.\nIf you still doubt this mystery,\nWhat else shall we call the yang spirit?\n\n**Warning Against Delusion**\n\nI sought the Dao, I studied Chan,\nWandered mountains and clouds, losing count of years.\nMonks boast of their Buddha-seed,\nDaoists prattle of immortals.\nThe Six Classics and Ten Treatises—mere words,\nThe seven returns and nine refinements—falsely transmitted.\nBound in this skin-bag’s prison,\nThey still speak of \"before parents were born.\"\n\n**To Lei Youzhi, Ill After the Great Army’s Retreat**\n\nHeaven’s net is vast, its mesh secure—\nWho finds lasting peace beneath its cover?\nHow many partings, how many regrets?\nEach rise and fall leaves only emptiness.\nOn wind-swept paths, corpses still lie,\nOn rain-washed battlefields, blood remains red.\nAsk the tiger-faced warriors of those years—\nHow many have lived to see white hair?\n\n**Self-Admonition: Cherishing Life**\n\nIn chaotic times, in cruel years, I know well enough—\nWithdraw your head, follow your lot, nurture true desire.\nOnce, there were countless youths,\nNow, only one or two old reeds remain.\nLife has no root—like a fish on a hook,\nThe body is bound—like a silkworm in its cocoon.\nFate’s rise and fall are fixed, without error,\nDo not let greed deceive your heart.\n\n**On the Dao**\n\nThe pearl of nature, formless, holds profound mystery,\nAdapting freely, it moves with nature.\nAll directions are clear, utterly transparent,\nAll things are embraced, the body follows their patterns.\nHidden, it retreats to the infinitesimal,\nManifest, it fills heaven and earth.\nIt is but one unobstructed thing—\nIts wondrous power knows no bounds.\n\n**Admonishing Greed**\n\nGreed’s coils bind the body—hear the sighs!\nOnly then do you know the earth’s snares bring harm.\nFear the needle before your eyes—cultivate thorns,\nDread the pit before your path—beware the trench.\nDisaster is born from fools’ blessings,\nFortune arises from the wise amid calamity.\nIf heroes do not judge in secret,\nXiang Yu and King Wu would rise again.\n\n**On the Perils of Delusion**\n\nTo speak of the profound’s inversions,\nYou must wander the heavens within the heavens.\nIf the heart still clings to things, do not discuss the Dao,\nIf nature has no root, do not speak of Chan.\nThe first stage does not plant lotuses in mud,\nHow then can the last bear water’s lilies?\nDo not wildly guess at sacred texts—\nLest your body incur the sin of false speech.\n\n**Song Master’s Teachings at the Yellow River**\n\nParting the clouds, he expounded widely among men,\nTwice he returned to the Yellow River in a year.\nHis virtue’s light opened the nine hells,\nHis compassion’s power shook the three mountains.\n\n**Breath and Pulse: The Alchemy of Yin and Yang**\n\nInhaling Kan, exhaling Li—yin and yang transform,\nWind and cloud unfurl and coil, heaven and earth at ease.\nLet this be known to all the world hereafter:\nThose who turn not toward goodness grow ever more foolish and stubborn.\n\n**Night Sitting**\n\nThe long night deepens at the third watch,\nMy subtle form soars forth from Jade Capital.\nWild clouds rejoice, a thousand miles of purity,\nMoonlight spills like a full wheel’s brilliance.\nSilver stars dot the frosty gleam,\nThe azure river runs clear, vast qi serene.\nWhy does the sun-crow leave the sea at dawn?\nA single bell’s toll startles the first meditation.\n\n**Realm of Joy**\n\nThe profound Dao lies within inward vision,\nBland as if tasteless, yet true joy abides.\nA pure breeze carries qi beyond the three mountains,\nBright moonlight flies, illuminating ten thousand miles.\nUnconstrained, I ascend to transformations,\nWhat need to distinguish inner from outer in this blissful roaming?\nAwakened, to whom could I speak alone?\nAll is entrusted to the pine winds’ plucked melody.\n\n**The Dao Is Not Two**\n\nBuddhism and Daoism share one source from the beginning,\nTathāgata and Laozi ascend heaven together.\nAn arrow pierces the iron drum, concealing deep principle,\nThe furnace refines golden elixir, veiling supreme mystery.\nThe white horse arrives bearing secret teachings,\nThe blue ox strides west, expounding true meaning.\nYet now, in this age, the black-robed and yellow-capped\nVainly pore over cinnabar texts and Buddhist scriptures.\n\n**In Praise of Knowing Advance and Retreat**\n\nAt leisure, I point backward to instruct the heroic:\nXiang Yu and King Liu—one move too high.\nThree scrolls of sacred writ held secrets at Gaixia,\nA single divine stratagem enabled escape at Kuaiji.\nXi Shi’s coquetry ensnared the roc’s net,\nEmpress Lü’s schemes emptily trapped the tiger’s den.\nSmall wit scheming great affairs\nIs like fish bait seeking to hook the whale.\n\n**Answering One Who Asks About Leisure**\n\nHaving admired the forests and springs’ carefree ease,\nI take up bowl and staff to companion green mountains.\nThree scrolls—*Yinfu*, *Daode*, and *Scripture*—\nTwo rooms—door of reeds, window of mulberry.\nSpirit birds of the Purple Palace diligently ferry me,\nThe leisurely chariot of Cinnabar Mountain swiftly follows.\nAt peace, my heart holds no lingering affairs,\nPine winds fill the courtyard as I close the gate at noon.\n\n**Visiting the Tombs of Immortals Zhao and Bai with Reverence**\n\nLate at night, incense coils from the precious stove,\nFacing the mounds, I lay bare my liver to supplicate the two masters.\nEight hundred deeds of cultivation—on what day were they perfected?\nThree thousand merits of toil—at what hour were they completed?\nWithin the world, Penglai’s isles remain hard to glimpse,\nBeyond the world, the heavens’ net is not easily known.\nI pray to enter dreams for clear revelation,\nTo cast aside this body and await the return to the Dao.\n\n**Yin Cong Entrusts His Tomb and Asks About Conduct**\n\nWith reverent heart, I light a stove of incense before the mound.\nThirty years of steadfast poverty, trembling through countless trials.\nIn motion and stillness, sitting and lying—my hundred bones age,\nIn roaming, resting, concealing, and cultivating—my temples frost.\nOne move toward non-being remains unfinished,\nDisloyal and unfilial—whose sin is this?\n\n**Met with Rejection by Others**\n\nCarrying a twin staff, a body like a wisp of cloud,\nI’ve drifted the world’s edges for twenty springs.\nGreen temples once sought the *Cantong* with great benefit,\nNow, silver-haired, I return home—no neighbors near.\nWill vermilion gates deign to glance at a thatched-door guest?\nWho pities the fox-fur-clad man in coarse hemp?\nThe immortal isles of the sea remain beyond reach,\nI endure both stretching and bending, nurturing natural truth.\n\n**Delighting in Poverty**\n\nThe fourth watch’s drum fades, the market’s clamor stills,\nI sleep soundly, carefree in my humble state.\nA scrap of paper covers a stone pillow,\nA rush mat spreads over a mound of silk floss.\nSometimes I follow white cranes to Penglai’s isles,\nSuddenly I ride a vermilion dragon to peer into grotto-heavens.\nSuch words are hard to speak in the world of men—\nVainly do fame and profit mock the wind-tossed madman.\n\n**Mid-Autumn Moon Gazing**\n\nClouds disperse, dust settles—half the autumn sky,\nStars and constellations distinct, the moon perfectly round.\nWho plays the flute atop the white jade tower?\nWithin the crystal palace, I tune my strings.\nLuminous as floating ice over sea and peaks,\nIts light immerses heaven and earth in crystalline clarity.\nSince ancient times, only this night each year—\nWhere in the world do men not stay up late?\n\n**To Prefect Li of Pingyang**\n\nThe people wail, their suffering unbearable,\nYet when a great official passes, their cold turns to warmth.\nGentle words soothe customs, adding to winter’s quilts,\nVirtue’s moisture nourishes the thirsty like sweet broth.\nWherever he goes, no harsh winds or rains,\nEverywhere his name sprays the fragrance of musk and orchid.\nHis flowing influence spares the vermilion gates from fear,\nThey hear only the thunderous sound of imperial favor’s light.\n\n**Seeing Off Wang Jinzhi**\n\nParting cups shimmer, sending off a dear friend,\nGrasping hands, sorrow spills tears upon our robes.\nNarrow paths and perilous bridges demand caution,\nAmid chaotic mountains and lone inns, guard your heart.\nCrimson leaves of fading glow stretch to distant hamlets,\nDawn’s light and crisp frost deepen the wild fields.\nStaff and sandals wander cloud and water’s vast expanse,\nWhen will our emotions again seek the ant’s incense?\n\n**Admonishing Master Yang**\n\nWith you, I speak especially of conduct and concealment:\nThe Dao resides in pure poverty—stand firm.\nTightly seal the five passes, and the body benefits,\nCarefully uphold the three treasures, and your path is unimpeded.\nRecommending the worthy and praising the good brings double beauty,\nComforting yourself while slandering others must wound both.\nWhat the noble man does is worth emulating—\nNaturally, fortune’s vines will stretch to the heavens.\n\n**The Daoist’s Actions Are Extraordinary**\n\nVirtue must be humble, will must be steadfast.\nThe wisdom-blade swings high, demons flee,\nThe elixir pellet glows, myriad evils hide.\nWithin the five-hued cauldron, golden medicine simmers,\nIn the seven-jeweled furnace, jade nectar refines.\nTrue cultivation of creation forges a robust body,\nThe path through heaven and earth stands majestic.\n\n**Lamenting the Times**\n\nDeparting the dust for the Dao, do not let your heart stray,\nHeaven and earth shift, the world changes.\nPetty men grow ever more cunning with each passing day,\nThe modest gentleman’s Dao dwindles in this age.\nAshen-hearted, he yields the seal after three pleas,\nIce-lipped, he declines gold, fearing the four who know.\nMostly, leave the threads of karma unheeded—\nBetter to sit like a clod, delighting in non-action.\n\n**Inducing the Multitude**\n\nThe art of immortal study holds wondrous mechanisms,\nAll within the questions of creation’s becoming.\nWater and fire shift—meet and return,\nWood and metal move—encounter and revert.\nA single wheel of sun and moon, yin and yang’s breath,\nThe six directions of heaven and earth lie at ease.\nMaster this practice,\nAnd you will know Penglai’s peaks arise everywhere.\n\n**Admonishing Disciples**\n\nTongue sharp, heart stubborn—students of the Dao,\nI urge and warn you: do not give way to anger.\nYouth’s spring silently departs, year by year you age,\nWhite hair stealthily arrives, day by day it renews.\nLove and attachment add grime to the heart,\nGlory’s sights gather dust in the eyes.\nOne morning, original truth dissipates entirely,\nProstrate on your pillow, you’ll vainly sigh for the distant Dao.\n\n**Warning Against Wasted Years**\n\nBack then, I angled for you—why did you not turn your head?\nEven if you turn now, cultivation is still delusion.\nSeeking fish in trees, toiling dawn to dusk,\nCatching the moon in water, passing spring and autumn.\nAt that time, had you angled and not turned away,\nThough you turn now, cultivation remains in vain.\nFishing in trees from dawn to dusk,\nGrasping at the moon in water through the seasons.\n\n**On the Fleeting Nature of Life**\n\nHonors and humiliations in darkness and light—brief as dreams,\nHow much sorrow in the stench of the divine, the withering of glory?\nWipe the bronze mirror, behold the hoary hair:\nThis year it thickens more than the last.\n\nThe tattered robe—threadbare, not a single seam holds,\nSeek its warp and weft, and none can be worn.\nFour seams square as the four apertures, round as the round,\nTwo sleeves long and dangling, then short again.\nWash away the grime—strip by strip it follows the water,\nBrush off the dust—flake by flake it chases the wind’s crest.\nNow I sleep in moonlight, nestle in clouds,\nUtterly bare, I pass my late years.\n\n**Warning Against Misinterpreting the *Yuanjue Sutra***\n\nThe true *Yuanjue Sutra* cannot be spoken,\nForced discourse on it wastes effort.\nEmpty *yuanjue* leaves no trace,\nGreat awakening’s perfection defies all models.\nDrowning and surfacing—vain gathering and scattering,\nClouds come and go—endless chasing.\nKnow that silence is the truest speech,\nYet none dare spread their mats before others.\n\n**Night Sitting in Liaoyang Palace**\n\nAlone I sit in Liaoyang as night deepens,\nThe Silver River gleams cold, the moon’s light chills.\nThe zither plays \"Breaking the Cassia\"—the Moon Goddess listens,\nThe sword dances to slay dragons—ghosts and demons watch.\nEight-sided and clear as ice, the mirror’s expanse,\nOne sky serene as a jade flask, boundless.\nHow many worldly men chase profit and fame?\nThey know not the gourd and ladle that cradle the Great Elixir.\n\n**Warning Against Misreading Books**\n\nWild guesses and reckless interpretations deceive in discourse,\nFailing to recognize the true, constant Dao’s root.\nScooping mud from the road to wipe a pile of dung,\nRinsing a glue pot with lacquered water.\nZhang Liang points to Meng Liang’s uncle,\nYangzi calls them the descendants of Liuzi.\nThey aspire to ascend the hall and enter the chamber,\nYet how many gates still lie between?\n\n**Admonition to Daoists: Leave Your Hometown**\n\nFor cultivation, it is crucial to leave your homeland,\nWithout traversing cloud-capped mountains, the Dao is hindered.\nMoonlight reaches the sky—utterly bright,\nWater flows to the sea—naturally vast.\nWillow fluff drifts south and north,\nThe ant and snail abandon their quarrels over length.\nWith no firewood beneath the cauldron, the flame dies of itself—\nWhy labor to stir boiling water?\n\n**Warning Against Private Schemes in the Hermitage**\n\nDo not rejoice too much in joy, nor grieve too much in sorrow,\nThis six-foot frame is but a bubble on water.\nToday’s joy—rejoice today,\nTomorrow’s sorrow—grieve tomorrow.\nOne breath unpassed, and you are rotting bones,\nHalf a speck of skin stinks—a skeleton.\nThe sages’ teachings feign deafness and blindness,\nWillingly serving as horses and oxen for children and grandchildren.\n\n**Warning Against Reckless Cultivation**\n\nTo study the Dao, one must refine jade and gold,\nThe true breath of Heaven’s origin runs deep.\nSeek not at the root’s fixed stem,\nNor vainly chase the blossoms’ empty tips.\nFocus *qi*, preserve essence—fill the belly,\nEmbrace the origin, guard the One—empty the heart.\nHow many suffer from wakeful illness,\nYet refuse to administer a single needle’s cure?\n\n**Warning to Qin Zhongnan and Shu Yongle**\n\nThe yellow root’s dream ends—teachings become the foundation,\nClouds point to Chongyang as the patriarch.\nA thousand *li* to Zhongnan, the heart rejoices to go,\nYet a single journey to Yongle, the feet grow weary.\nTruth is seen only after the flowers,\nThe root precedes the sprout—so it has ever been.\nThe old folk rhyme now proves true:\nOnly then does one know—layer by layer, skin upon skin.\n\n**Resting in the Pure Yang Palace on a Summer Day**\n\nWho does not dread the scorching summer sun?\nThe meditation couch, the pine wind—cool and refreshing.\nTea and milk fill the cup, clear dew glistens,\nSandalwood smoke curls into a canopy, white clouds fragrant.\nWithin nature, form and emptiness merge,\nBeyond the heart, worldly toil is forgotten in sitting.\nGazing outward, the ridges of Tiaoshan—clouds scatter,\nThe sun shifts, flower shadows climb the eastern wall.\n\n**Admonition to Liu Zigao**\n\nThe Daoist’s bearing is distinct, his conduct steadfast,\nUnashamed to wear a threadbare, patched robe all his life.\nBeyond the world, he fixes his heart on friends beyond the world,\nIn the world, he engages with those of the world.\nHis will must be as yielding as the waters of Linzhou,\nHis *qi* must rise like Mount Taihua’s heights.\nDare I ask of later words—do not retreat or falter,\nFor I have sworn to use the fish’s bait to hook the whale and leviathan.\n\n**Escaping the Heat at the Stork and Sparrow Tower**\n\nAtop the Stork and Sparrow Tower, the heat does not reach,\nA gentle southern breeze pierces the heart’s field.\nDust and earth—each grain falls away,\nA thousand *li* of mountains and rivers come before the eyes.\nLying down, I drink the pure wind—my heart drunk on the Dao,\nSitting in forgetfulness, the turbid realm—my nature at peace in meditation.\nThe hues of Zhongtiao Mountain half in fading light,\nCrimson and green intertwine, threading the evening mist.\n\n**Wandering the Mountain Hermitage**\n\nThe secluded mountain hermitage veiled in mist,\nClouds seal the hidden path, water flows east and west.\nAfter rain by the stream, monkeys pluck fruit,\nIn the sun-warmed pines, cranes preen in the wind.\nThe old man tends herbs in the garden plots,\nChildren play at gathering lingzhi beneath the boulders.\nOne day, I’ll cast aside worldly affairs,\nExhale rainbow breath, return to the Great Void.\n\n**Reflections in Old Age**\n\nWhite hair and a scholar’s cap—nothing suits me now,\nDaily I sleep late, rise even later.\nMoon waxing and waning—how many times have I seen it?\nWho is humbled, who is honored—I know not.\nIdle talk of the noble man’s words,\nWild chanting of the Daoist’s poems beyond the world.\nA lifetime unconcerned with the floating life’s reckoning,\nBeyond this non-action—nothing is done.\n\n**Warning Against Greed and Abuse of Power**\n\nUnreasonable greed runs to excess,\nThe heart’s nets and snares bitterly ensnare.\nHeat and cold still shift with the four seasons,\nDay and night still follow the solstices.\nFilling the sea—Xufu’s efforts crumble to laughter,\nMoving mountains—Zifang’s strength is spent in song.\nDo not say success and failure are man-made,\nWhen the tally is done—what can be done?\n\n**Warning Against Blind Study**\n\nThe Dao relies on a bright teacher’s guidance to the end,\nYet others’ cases are still sought out.\nTo ascend to heaven, one must borrow the ascent lamp,\nTo cross the sea, one must rely on the crossing boat.\nAll things arise from their origin,\nGrass waves ripple from their source.\nHow pitiful—the ant’s admiration of blind cultivation,\nThe mad swallow’s frenzied play in the mirage’s tower.\n\n**Returning Home**\n\nIn years past, I wandered east and west in search of the Dao,\nToday, gourd and ladle return to my village.\nI can but roll up my ambitions, hide my striving,\nI cannot bear to speak of poverty and success.\nHuman feelings—warm and cool, fragrant and distinct,\nWorldly affairs—rise and fall, ever changing.\nHow many in fox-fur and sable hats?\nAt Ba Ling, their news—still puffed with arrogance.\n\n**Admonition to Disciples: Embrace Labor**\n\nDo not shirk the toil of worldly dust—it accumulates blessings,\nTo rise high, one must take the low as foundation.\nActivities do not hinder heaven and earth’s union,\nMovement does not obstruct the sun and moon’s course.\nThe four *dhyānas* of *yuanjue* settle in sequence,\nThe three thieves of the *Yinfu* naturally align.\nOne truth, unwavering from beginning to end,\nOver time, within the void, a child is nurtured.\n\n**Mid-Autumn Night**\n\nThe wind parts the cloud curtain—mid-autumn arrives,\nI pull a friend, carry the zither, feast in the small tower.\n\n**Mid-Autumn Night (continued)**\n\nIncense ash fills the censer, adding to the tiled burner,\nReed blinds roll high, hung on silver hooks.\nDelighted to behold the full moon’s face,\nHow could it stir even half a trace of sorrow?\nDrunk on the western wind, self and other forgotten,\nWith eyes unparted, I gaze upon Penglai’s isles.\n\n**Presented to Recorder Zhao**\n\nThe constant Dao—non-action, mysterious and wondrous,\nYet worldly folk cling to its fringes, seeking signs.\nLost currents branch, obscuring the true source;\nA steadfast will cuts through crookedness to grasp the essential.\nThe superior person hears it, believes, and acts,\nWhile the foolish, even when told, scoff and mock.\nThus, I cast my hook into the vast waves,\nKnowing the great turtle’s bait is hard to take.\n\n**Upper Scroll of *Awakening to Reality* concludes**\n\n**Lower Scroll of *Awakening to Reality***\n\n**Collected Works of Master Li, the Master of Mystical Communication of Mount Brocade Screen**\n\n**Poems**\n\n**Exhortation to Cultivate the Dao: Leave Home Early**\n\nCultivation need not take you far from kin and love—\nIt is for this life’s debts of mud and water.\nOriginally formed by mud and water,\nIn the end, you’ll be ruined by mud and water.\n\n**The Master Who Would Not Permit (the Fisherman)**\n\nAdrift on the bitter sea, longing to hook the turtle,\nYet seeing it, dare not cast the line.\nAlas! A single surge capsizes the boat,\nWaves churn higher in the raging wind.\n\n**Inward Gaze: The Moon of the Heart**\n\nOne’s own palace halls stretch boundless as the sky,\nHigh hangs the full white jade disk.\nBright and pure, its radiance free of shadows,\nBehind deep curtains, it may be gazed upon at will.\n\n**Taming the Monkey**\n\nIn the mountains of the Red Emperor, a black-furred ape,\nClimbing flowers, plucking fruit—hard to restrain.\nNow, struck with the Vajra’s rope,\nIt is bound in the Yellow Court, head never raised.\n\n**Tethering the Horse**\n\nThe crimson steed of the numinous terrace grows too proud and fat,\nLoving to neigh in the wind and beneath the moon.\nFortunately, the land is at peace, no battles to fight—\nTightly tethered to the old trough, it is not led to ride.\n\n**Question: Why Not Leave the Hermitage for Even a Moment?**\n\nA retreat’s livelihood—home of earth and self,\nWith care, I craft three chariots.\nCarving through ancient ruts, passing Kunlun’s peaks,\nThe great Dao flows unimpeded, without hindrance.\nPainfully drinking the elixir, watering jade blossoms,\nDrunk, I sleep as the sun slants west.\nGuests come, knocking at the gate again and again,\nYet in a dream of wandering immortals, I have not yet returned.\n\n**The Realm Within the Gourd**\n\nWithin heaven, another heaven—rarely known,\nThe true realm of non-birth is its foundation.\nThe Daoist has roamed within this very space—\nAsk not of cultivation, of non-action, or of effort.\n\n**Trying the Brush**\n\nHand and heart forget each other, the jade brush sways,\nIts sound like cold rain, rustling and clear.\nNot departing from a few sheets of cocoon paper,\nIt writes out dragons and serpents by the thousands.\n\n**Spring Sorrow**\n\nPeople suffer endlessly with spring’s arrival,\nYet casually, it climbs my brow with ease.\nI ponder: white hair, pitiless in its ways,\nAdds itself without asking its master.\n\n**Visiting Prefect Yuan**\n\nAfter autumn rains, the dawn wind sighs,\nProbing my thoughts, I test my robe for chill.\nSmall wealth nears completion, approaching great wealth—\nThe brushwood gate remains closed as I seek the vermilion door.\n\n**Against Slander and Arrogance**\n\nTen thousand cares sink, one qi surges,\nDawn and dusk, ever in the boundless void.\nWhen others speak to me, I grow weary of words—\nSeeing through all, I know every matter is empty.\n\n**Mistaken Recognition**\n\nSeek not the Buddha in halls of sound and form,\nNor search for immortals in fragrant grottoes.\nObserve the monkey groping the moon in the waves—\nOnly when the reflection stirs do you know it is not the sky.\n\n**Snow**\n\nClouds rise, wind carries snow in flurries—\nWho recognizes the workings of heaven and earth’s creation?\nBefore the jade-green peaks, the boy laughs:\nThe black ox has turned into a white ox and returned.\n\n**Dreaming of Drinking**\n\nWeary of zither and books, in the small pavilion,\nI dream of following Liu and Ruan to drink in Peach Blossom Spring.\nAwake, I drink again; drunk, I wake once more—\nSilent and still, no one but the dawn gibbons cry.\n\n**A Friend Visits**\n\nYesterday, a good friend came in waxed sandals,\nAt dusk, I returned from the riverbank, carefree and smiling.\nThe woodcutter boy attended me as I sat by the stream—\nEven without composing new poems, it was joy enough.\n\n**Nurturing Aspiration**\n\nGathering zither and books, I return home,\nThe crane’s feathers are whole, the clam has formed its shell.\nSoaring through the sky’s rivers without hindrance,\nI proudly display the divine pearl, dazzling the nine dusts.\n\n**Admonition on Mourning the Dead**\n\nThe foul transforms into the divine, the divine into the foul,\nIn the wheel of rebirth, the old becomes new again.\nKnowing well the nature of things is thus,\nWhy do the living send off the dead?\n\n**Dwelling in the Mountains**\n\nI have coiled my traces in this thatched hut for years,\nCasually, I do nothing before the mountain.\nDo not say idleness is not of my choosing—\nIt is the human heart that clings to ten thousand illusions.\n\nPeaks on the roof mirror the setting sun,\nHalf the forest’s red and emerald encircle the thatched hall.\nAfter tea, guests depart, the brushwood gate is closed—\nIdly, I play with the flowing spring in the evening chill.\n\n**Parting from Hejin, Harmonizing with Master Ma’s Rhymes**\n\nJoyfully lodged in the mountain hut, uncertain of return,\nThe migrating geese call, stirring thoughts of home.\nNow that I have attained the joy of carefree wandering,\nI intend to learn from the solitary cloud, flying freely.\n\nThe Daoist’s heart is as idle as the white clouds,\nMovement and stillness, at ease and unhurried.\nRecalling the time to leave the valley, I left the valley;\nTo return to the mountain, I return to the mountain.\n\n**Lamenting Life and Death**\n\nDo not grieve for the dead corpse over the living one—\nThe father departs, and soon the son follows.\nThe ledger of the shades is clearly limited,\nOnly the timing of the tally—early or late—is contested.\n\n**Moonlit Night**\n\nThe wind gathers the cloud curtain, revealing the blue sky,\nHeaven and earth—an ice flask, clear and bright.\nTen thousand sparse stars, the Silver River faint,\nA single wheel of the bright moon, perfectly round and alone.\n\n**Yang Fire**\n\nYang light ascends, piercing another heaven,\nBelow, it reaches boundlessly to the ninefold barriers.\nStars and moon hide, yin demons vanish—\nA single wheel blazes, solitary and round.\n\n**Herding the Ox**\n\nThe cowherd sings at dusk by the river,\nReleasing the white ox, he does not lead it.\nBeyond the reeds, in the mist and water,\nA single wheel of the bright moon shines on the blue sky.\n\n**Self-Joy**\n\nExternally, no afflictions; internally, no thoughts,\nNeither drunk nor sober, neither near nor far.\nWhy is the Daoist heart clear and joyful?\nWhen the blue sky’s wind is gentle and the moon bright.\n\n**Ignorance of the True Heart**\n\nAll speak of cultivating the heart, yet none know the heart—\nThe true heart hides deep in the grotto-heaven.\nIf you wish to know, ask not the cultivator of reality—\nHe has traversed the ends of the earth without finding it.\n\n**Sent to Master Yang**\n\nWhen the great Dharma hall bestowed the sword,\nYou were charged to entrust it to a true man.\nAlas! How did it fall into the hands of the weak?\nIts sorrowful cries within the scabbard—who can know?\n\n**Exhortation to Study**\n\nThe primordial qi of heaven is the ladder to the sky,\nGather and cultivate it—you must know this clearly.\nMastering it from beginning to end without weariness,\nOnly the timing of success—early or late—is contested.\n\n**Against Greed and Pursuit**\n\nChasing the fly’s-head profit with all one’s might,\nHeedless of others’ hardship, careless of the four knowings.\n\nA Day’s Accumulation Becomes a Sin of Full Measure\nTo whom shall the karmic debt be repaid?\n\n**Admonition Against Summoning Future Misfortune**\nNine-tenths of loyal words miss their mark,\nTo one’s face they feign compliance, behind one’s back they turn to demons.\nFan Li awakened in time and escaped later calamity,\nFuchai saw only the shame of Wu Zixu.\n\n**Despising Fame and Profit**\nReturn, come away—snow crowns your head,\nThe heart’s craving for fame and profit suddenly ceases.\nSeizing the moment to settle the debt of rebirth,\nThis life, at least, gains one move ahead.\n\n**Secluded Dwelling**\nBalustrades of several stalks of gentlemanly bamboo,\nLow windows with a few scrolls of the Sage’s books.\nThe dream of roaming immortals breaks as pine shadows shift,\nOne strum of the zither brings more than enough joy.\n\n**Inner Skill**\nBlowing red, a furnace of fire at the sea’s bottom,\nMelting away two sheets of ice atop the mountain.\nWhen the fire extinguishes itself, the ice vanishes of itself,\nSunlight and moonlight together shine in perfect clarity.\n\n**Lament for the Treasure of the Dao**\nForging and shaping the great unhewn jade is one’s livelihood,\nIts radiance illumines past and present without blemish.\nLet it go, draw it back—the cosmos grows narrow,\nIts towering spiritual use knows no bounds.\n\n**Later Tuning the Zither**\nCasually tuning the zither at leisure,\nSitting close to the brazier’s fire, freely at ease.\nEnamored of the crystalline melodies beyond the frets,\nHeedless of the unmelted snow at the gate.\n\n**Daytime Repose**\nDaytime slumber in the bright window—what bliss,\nNot a speck of dust or care lingers in the heart.\nSweetly half-awakened from a dream of roaming immortals,\nOnce more he gazes into the Gourd Heaven.\n\n**Traveling to Hezhong Prefecture After War**\nShun’s capital, its towers and pavilions once the finest under heaven,\nHow many times reduced to ashes, how many times rebuilt?\nOnly the foothills of Mount Tiao remain,\nMajestic as ever, passing through spring and autumn.\n\n**Western Pavilion of Liaoyang Palace**\nThe western pavilion stands high, its nature hazy,\nDrunk on the western wind, merging with the vastness of space.\nHow many true transformations occur within the void?\nJoyfully entrusted, unspoken.\n\nFar from the clamor of the western pavilion, distant from the city’s bustle,\nThe boundless Dharma realm I deeply cherish.\nWhen visitors from noble houses arrive, I am too weary to engage,\nAlone, I claim the title of idle one, feasting in seated meditation.\n\nIn the western pavilion, clouds rest as I pillow my head on books and sleep,\nA tiled censer with mountain incense wafts auspicious smoke.\nA single pure note pierces the ear,\nThe jade zither, stirred by the wind, rings out of its own accord.\n\n**Ascending the Stork Tower to View the River**\nOn earth, the long river; beneath heaven, the mountains,\nHeaven’s wrath stirs the waves into tumultuous return.\nHow much better the nameless guest upon the tower,\nUnmoved by wind or wave, at ease in idleness.\n\n**Summer Evening Inspiration**\nFrom the southern breeze, evening’s chill arises,\nRagged robes spread, zither laid across, facing the setting sun.\nThree refrains fade as the bright moon rises,\nA young servant comes to invite me for the evening incense burning.\n\n**After the First Rain of the Sacrificial Offering**\nSweet rain clears at dawn, the days grow long,\nA light chill still restrains the fragrant herbs.\nTo whom can one speak of the Dao’s joy in such scenes?\nAlone, I stand defiantly in the east wind, bathed in evening sunlight.\n\n**Early Morning at the Mouth of Liaoyang Terrace**\nSeveral chimes of the golden bell dispel the morning chill,\nThe dream of roaming immortals breaks—I cannot sleep.\nRising, I gaze at the moon atop Mount Taihua’s peak,\nIts slanting light immerses the shadow of Mount Tiao in the sky.\n\n**Wen the Scholar Inquires About the Dao**\nThe constant Dao is ever self-knowing,\nKnowing the constant, the Dao is non-action.\nNon-action attains what cannot be spoken,\nTo speak of the true and constant is to depart from the Dao.\n\n**Sent to Master Ren of Shannan**\nA decade of silence since our parting in worldly talk,\nHow often have I seen wild geese linger in their comings and goings?\nGazing until the wind and moon at the mountain’s edge fade,\nI imagine you, too, nurturing your lofty leisure in the same way.\n\n**Presented to Master Zhang Entering the Garden**\nRestrain body and foot to diligently practice the Dao,\nForget appearances and words to feast in seated meditation.\nGreat awakening, perfect penetration, illuminating the five eyes,\nNot departing from the present—this is the net of heaven.\n\n**Lament for the Hastening of Sun and Moon**\nJust past Mid-Autumn, the bright moon full,\nAgain comes the Double Ninth, the chrysanthemum’s season.\nThe four seasons tirelessly hasten one’s aging,\nStitching together one year after another.\n\n**Admonition Against Mourning**\nLife and death at dawn and dusk—no mistake in this,\nLong life or short, all is a dream of Nanke.\nFacing the deceased, do not stir thoughts of sorrow and grief,\nWhen it comes to your own turn, what can you do?\n\n**Revisiting Hezhong**\nForty years ago, I wandered this place,\nHow many times has its splendor changed through spring and autumn?\nThe Yellow River cares not for the rise and fall of mortal shells,\nAs ever, it surges and flows eastward.\n\n**Evening Stroll in Seclusion**\nHemp robe sweeping the ground, slender stalks tall,\nTreading through cloud-capped mountains as the evening sun sets.\nTurning back at dusk, incense and lamps extinguished,\nLaughing, I part the wind and moon to enter the meditation chamber.\n\n**Lament for Those Who Harm Others**\nThe cicada’s clamor on the pine branch shows no end,\nThe mantis’s claws and teeth are sharp as hooks.\nIts heart set only on the sweet taste of the cicada,\nHow could it heed the oriole lurking behind?\n\n**Clearly Guarding One’s Lot**\nIn this life, no grand deeds,\nEndowed with a nature too foolish.\nOne bowl of rice from a thousand households,\nThree winters in a hundred-patched robe.\nIn all things, ever content,\nIn every matter, never furrowed brow.\nWhy is poverty so steadfast?\nThe Primordial Origin speaks of frugality and compassion.\n\n**Praising Poverty on the Journey to Establish a Hermitage in Hejin in Autumn**\nStraw hat and rain cape, leaving mulberry and catalpa,\nThe season of frosted leaves has come.\nZither and books cast aside, my companions,\nBowl and alms-bowl, I seek other worthies.\nFrost invades the tiled bed,\nRain drips from the crumbling eaves.\nTiger and wolf tracks outside the door,\nMoss carpets the window.\nWalking, I marvel at the lane of Yan Yuan,\nSleeping, I nestle in the wool of Hou Ji.\nScarcely a dragon-tail inkstone,\nShelves bare of crow’s-head planks.\nDipping a worn brush,\nGrinding thick ink from a broken inkstick.\nInspired, I compose the biography of Yuan Xian,\nAt leisure, I peruse the writings of Fan Dan.\nNot resenting others’ deep generosity,\nEver mindful of my own meager virtue.\nFirm in poverty, my heart does not waver,\nEmbracing the Dao, my resolve grows stronger.\nSitting in profound obscurity,\nMeditating in silent stillness.\nThis illusory body nurtures the chamber of a fathom’s depth,\nMy true nature pierces the layers of mystery.\nWithin and without, fused as one,\nThroughout the vast cosmos, all is filled.\nThe five phases cannot alter creation,\nThe two qi cease their pressing urgency.\nThe realm of utmost joy and purity,\nA carefree, self-so immortal.\nThe wondrous mechanism defies description,\nSealed lips await heaven’s appointed years.\n\n**Admonition to Disciples**\nIn cultivation, do not be blind,\nDevote yourself with purity and sincerity.\nThough heaven may collapse, do not fear,\nThough earth may split, do not be startled.\nBelow, forget poverty and lowliness,\nAbove, hold nobles in disdain.\nAmidst clamor, seize stillness,\nWithin death, escape life.\nInternally, preserve the pure body,\nExternally, sever worldly ties.\nPerfectly illuminate the five eyes,\nAttain the fruit of the three vehicles.\nThese words I repeat as exhortation,\nMy brothers, my kin.\nThe phoenix soars in true flight,\nThe lame turtle lags behind.\nFlattery to one’s face, slander behind one’s back,\nWealth prized over righteousness.\nDelighting in the antics of apes,\nMimicking the squabbles of chickens.\nNature ensnared by sound and beauty,\nIntent fixed on fame and achievement.\n\n**Inquiry to You, in Earnest**\nWhat, pray, do you seek in your journey ahead?\n\n**Ode on Leaving the World**\nMen heed the clear notes of the horn,\nYet turn deaf to thunder’s roar.\nNow I depart—\nThe great limit nears its end.\nGood deeds I would speak of,\nYet speech finds no belief.\nMy brothers, my kin,\nPress onward in the Dao.\n\n*End of Lower Scroll, Comprehending

Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Taiping* Section.\n\n**Scroll One of *The Collected Realizations of Awakening***\n*Collected by Master Li, the Permeating Mystery Man of Brocade Screen Mountain*\n\n**Song of Burning the Medicine Bag**\nMedicine bag, medicine bag—detached from my elbow,\nFor twenty years you’ve been my knowing friend.\nAt times you’ve clothed me in silks and satins,\nAt times you’ve drowned me in wine and flowers.\nThrough countless households, rich and poor alike,\nNo day or hour passed without your tread at my door.\nYou’ve muddled the wellspring of glory,\nBewildered the inch of the pulse,\nPiling disaster upon disaster with reckless moxa and needles.\nFor you, I’ve accumulated merit and practiced arts in vain;\nThrough you, disputes and karmic debts have arisen.\nToday I burn you without hesitation,\nFor my heart is no longer what it once was.\nThe medicine bag, engulfed in flame, unleashes divine might,\nIts roar like thunder shaking the heavens.\nCompared to the scalding broth I once offered you,\nYou now repent—your body and mind struck first.\nThe source of fortune clears,\nThe root of sin decays.\nLeaping free, I shed this mortal husk.\nBarrier mountains rise a thousand fathoms, their peaks piercing clouds,\nThe bitter sea surges a thousand leagues, its waves clashing with the stars.\nThe Dao of Heaven is lofty—how lofty is it?\nThe Dao of Earth is deep—how deep is it?\nEarth has its apertures, Heaven its ladder,\nSun and moon alternate in brightness, undisturbed by dusk or dawn.\nAzure clouds and white qi intertwine in purity,\nBlack mists and crimson vapors swirl within the void.\nAt the center they merge, forming a radiant treasure,\nIts light piercing straight through the azure heavens.\nThe original form, the wondrous body, delights in this life,\nOne with the Great Void, boundless and eternal.\n\n**Song of the Tarnished Mirror**\nAlas, tarnished mirror! Alas, tarnished mirror!\nIts pure body cannot withstand the dust’s clinging grasp.\nThough sturdy in its bronze form,\nIts face and features are no longer bright compared to its first state.\nThe shape remains round as before,\nYet within, the luminous nature of roundness is obscured.\nTo apply the wondrous medicine and polish it anew,\nWashing away the filth and stains of the past—\nThe whole body, transparent and unobstructed, becomes resplendent,\nRevealing the crookedness of others.\nSealed in a jade casket, hidden deep in the grotto chamber,\nIt remains eternally pure, enduring as heaven and earth.\n\n**Song of Awakening to Futile Toil**\nAwakening to futile toil! Awakening to futile toil!\nOnce awakened, I gladly partake of coarse fare and pickled dregs.\nThe hues of Mount Shouyang harbor vain resentment,\nThe waves of the Miluo River churn with empty rage.\nTen battles won, the sword beheads the chieftain,\nOne act of defiance, the blade carves out the heart.\nThe ancients, unknowing, met such calamities—\nWhy do men of today, though aware, still suffer them?\nWhat is clear may be displayed,\nWhat is hidden may be concealed.\nTo know the difficulty yet not retreat—fools indeed!\nBurning the corpse, swallowing charcoal—thrice ponder the folly,\nDiscarding the gourd, burying the dice—a single move excels.\nWe, the mediocre and dull,\nDrape ourselves in blue and purple, strutting as heroes.\nSwiftly decide to gather the Three Treasures,\nLest delay turn your hair to frost.\nAwaken within the dream,\nEscape beyond the world.\nLight furs and silk sashes exchanged for hempen robes,\nA gaunt frame of seven feet, tapping a dragon-headed staff,\nA thread of complexion three spans long, binding a tiger’s sash.\nWide sleeves sweep open the path of no affairs,\nStraw sandals tread through the prison of attachments.\nIn the Hall of Eternal Light, golden millet is sown,\nIn the Garden of Vital Qi, jade paste is cultivated.\nThe chicken transforms into a phoenix,\nThe carp becomes a turtle.\nThe resolve to cultivate the Dao soars beyond the clouds.\nVoices ascend to the crimson towers, proclaiming the Way,\nResounding like immortal birds crying in the nine marshes.\n\n**Song of the Rustic Fool**\nThe Two Modes, high and deep, form a wondrous pair,\nFrom them, the myriad things are born and take shape.\nAmong the myriad things, none is nobler than man,\nYet how few among men can guard their noble essence?\nYesterday, I sighed for this life of mine,\nNeither disgraced nor honored, thanks to Heaven’s protection.\nI too have gathered and scattered with heroes,\nUnburdened by hunger or cold, free from the dust of the world.\nNow, old and withered in this former frame,\nI deeply resent the mockery of fools who call me rustic.\nDeaf and blind, half-witted and dull,\nLame and hunchbacked, my mouth sealed against profit.\nI dare not speak idly to others,\nYet when I utter loyal words, they benefit knowing friends.\nThe Jade Pond churns, turning the eight elixirs,\nWatering the rootless tree to immortality.\nOthers scramble in busyness, possessing nothing within,\nWhile my livelihood arises from nothingness.\nBe it deep night or bright day,\nIn sitting, lying, dwelling, or walking, I forget the body’s inquiry.\nSilent and serene, I settle without ceasing,\nTurning the celestial wheel, operating the mechanism’s mortar.\nEarth’s qi surges,\nHeaven’s rain pours,\nFilling rivers and seas, suffusing the cosmos.\nTortoises follow serpents in racing pursuit,\nTigers roar and dragons bellow in fierce embrace.\nLofty pavilions and jade-towered halls rise in splendor,\nThe cavern of Mount Jing resounds with the howling of numinous winds.\nRiding this wind, I ascend back to the Great Void,\nPiercing through the Gate of Heaven in a crashing breakthrough.\nFragrant clouds, laden with fragrance, cradle the moon’s glow,\nAuspicious mists, drifting and dense, shroud the stars.\nDo not say the path of cultivation is not arduous—\nTo resent others’ ignorance is itself a grievous error.\nIf you have not yet arrived, vow to arrive,\nIf you have not yet attained, resolve to attain.\nOffer the incense of a vast and uncluttered heart,\nBeseeching the immortal masters for eternal companionship.\n\n**Song of Lament for Not Recognizing Nature and Life**\nTo cultivate without recognizing the true empty nature\nIs like polishing a tarnished mirror in a vat of glue and lacquer.\nExhausting effort in endless polishing,\nYet in the end, clarity and brightness remain elusive.\nTrue empty nature! True empty nature!\nWithout color or sound, beyond sight or hearing.\nHidden or manifest, the void is not truly void—\nSeek it and it cannot be seen, call it and it responds.\nTo cultivate the Dao without recognizing the true original life\nIs like plucking leaves to seek branches, forcing a door’s hinge.\nEmpty sprouts may grow, but they bear no fruit,\nNeglecting the primal essence, the fruit remains unproven.\nTrue original life! True original life!\nThe Supreme Ultimate divides its form, becoming the root’s handle.\nWithin the effortless transformations of the myriad things,\nSurpassing creation’s work, one may become a sage.\nTo cultivate only life, not nature,\nIs like adorning a stubborn chime with black gold—\nShatter the stubborn form, and it falls into emptiness,\nYet one remains mired in the quagmire of void and purity.\nTo cultivate only nature, not life,\nIs like water and fire failing to merge, like scorched rice—\nLife incomplete, nature unreal,\nStubborn emptiness drifts through the yin realms.\nCultivate both nature and life,\nEmerging from delusion’s illness.\nWhen nature and life are both complete, the mystery deepens,\nIn one leap, far removed from the wheel’s endless path.\n\n**Song of Lament for Worldly Acquaintances**\nThe Primal Simplicity scatters, bequeathing forms to things,\nThings perish and arise, driven by cold and heat.\nThe world knows peace and strife, portents of human karma,\nEmotions mourn and rejoice, affairs unite and part.\nWith body and nature, we come, yet remain obscured,\nLives long or short, we depart, still lost in confusion.",

      "translated_text": "The mind at leisure stands serene and high,\nWith coarse hemp robes and simple fare, all worldly hues defy.\nWhen eyes grow weary, I lay aside the half-unrolled scroll,\nWhen hands grow slack, I leave the broken lute strings whole.\n\nMy heart finds rest in poetry’s unpaid debt,\nMy joy needs no coin to buy the wine I fret.\nTo stretch or bend, I follow fate’s decree,\nLike drifting duckweed or tumbleweed, I pass the years with glee.\n\nContent in poverty, my patched robe thin,\nI fear no biting wind that chills the bone within.\nToo lazy even to wash my face each day,\nToo idle for my fingers to fasten hair in array.\n\nOn stone bed’s coolness, sleep is sweet and deep,\nIn cotton nest’s soft warmth, I sit and wake from sleep.\nBeyond this flesh, my heart and soul take flight,\nThe storm may rage, yet leaves me undisturbed in light.\n\n*Self-Joy*\n\nThe world is bound in profit’s chains and fame’s tight tether,\nYet I, though poor, rejoice in tranquil leisure’s weather.\nMy mind’s pure realm holds wonders manifold,\nWhile red dust’s whirls beyond me ebb and flow untold.\n\nNo need to vie by plunging in the stream,\nNo need to hide on Shang’s peaks to dream.\nBeneath the willow’s shade, my rope-bed sways,\nIn silent stillness, dawn to dusk I spend my days.\n\n*Admonition to the Multitude*\n\nWith heart at ease, my spirit calm and clear,\nI sing wild songs, then sing again to cheer.\nMagic herbs draw earth’s qi to bloom,\nCelestial nectar flows through heaven’s loom.\n\nCut worldly thoughts to keep the immortal’s creed,\nDrive off the poetry demon—let Dao’s demon lead.\nIf you grasp these demons’ meaning true,\nYou’ll outdo even me in madness too.\n\n*Good and Evil*\n\nGood and evil both arise from one same source,\nYet their uses differ in their course.\nKind words should fall like rain that nurtures flowers,\nAnger’s gusts should not be winter’s icy powers.\n\nBy the phoenix’s house, old willows stand,\nBeyond the tiger’s den, melons grow in the land.\nThe sages of old were not without their wit,\nYet they forgot all words to find joy in poverty’s pit.\n\n*Warning Against Harming the Multitude*\n\nThe tongue may sweetly scent, the belly foully reek,\nSuch friendships drag men down to ruin’s deep.\nFair faces dare not break the precept’s hold,\nCunning words betray the caution’s code untold.\n\nWhen deceitful thoughts arise, heart and mouth divide,\nWhen lying lips part, the mouth betrays the heart inside.\nCease not in schemes to always win the fight,\nFor when defeat arrives, calamity runs deep as night.\n\n*Diligent Cultivation*\n\nAwakened to truth, leave the Five Lakes behind,\nWith heart resolved, no need to roam the mountains blind.\nWithin the rise and fall of heaven and earth’s span,\nThe clouds and rain are drawn in breath’s ebb and flow’s plan.\n\nRefine the Five Phases to forge the Three Fields’ treasure,\nCommand the myriad changes to return the Nine Qi’s measure.\nThis six-foot frame holds no fixed form,\nWhy then should aught disturb my calm?\n\n*Idle Days: Expressing My Feelings*\n\nWillows by the gate, pines in the yard where melons grow,\nAn alchemy furnace, scriptures—this old life’s tableau.\nStartled by the crow’s cry knocking on the fragrant tree,\nAt ease, I lure the wandering bees to wildflowers free.\n\nMy sleeves dance in the wind as I turn and sway,\nMy hairpin leans on stone, my cap sits askew all day.\nIf someone asks where I make my abode,\nI smile and point to the clouds where my home is bestowed.\n\n*To Master Zhang on the Unity of the Dao*\n\nThe Great Dao is non-action, nature’s own way,\nThrough Chan’s semblance, true Chan comes to stay.\nNature fuses with form, beyond all divide,\nLife knocks on yin and yang, where inversion and truth abide.\n\nWind stirs beneath my feet, my body wings the earth,\nThe moon shines at my head, my back grinds the sky’s girth.\nWho would believe that from nothing, all things arise?\nPhoenix and crane soar freely, needing no whip’s guise.\n\n*Seeing Master Zhang Off to Shaanxi*\n\nA recluse beyond the world is seldom met,\nWith joy in greeting, sorrow in parting—endless fret.\nYour virtue’s light scatters like rain on Qin’s plain,\nYour Dao’s qi lingers like wind in Jin’s domain.\n\nToday we laugh and talk in shared delight,\nIn future times, who knows if we’ll reunite?\nBeyond the clouds and mist, in the immortals’ land,\nWill this old man of drifting fate still stand?\n\n*Admonition Against Weariness of Worldly Toil*\n\nWorldly toil should serve as awakening’s gate,\nYet toil itself breeds weariness and endless want’s weight.\nEach act of crafting leaves the heart remorseful, sore,\nA hundred thoughts bring hardship, grief to the core.\n\nThe seven po souls scatter with karmic seeds,\nThe three hun souls are stolen by sleep’s thieving deeds.\nIf you grasp this truth for cultivation’s art,\nWhen will you ever board the Dharma’s ship to start?\n\n*Exhortation to the Unawakened*\n\nBefore sealing the Five Passes, how can you refine the Nine Returns?\nVainly you fast to quell disputes, seek herbs to keep youth’s burns.\nThe Five Phases never leave yin and yang’s shell,\nThe Two Things are bound within creation’s spell.\nIf you comprehend the principle of non-action, formless and free,\nYou’ll find joy in idleness, neither near nor far from thee.\n\n*Admonition Against Indulging in Books*\n\nTo gather dusty thoughts in furrowed brows is vain,\nFor gain and loss have ever been a forked lane.\nA thousand ancient tomes the scholars may explain,\nBut only Daoists know the immortal’s scene’s domain.\nIn youth, experience the world’s affairs,\nIn prime, seek the Great Dao’s base.\nI warn the clever: discern early, be wise,\nLest wit turn to folly in your eyes.\n\n*Mourning Master Wei*\n\nAll day I mourn you, touching your cloud-coffin’s side,\nAt last you’ve realized the Perfect Truth’s pure guide.\nThe cicada sheds its golden husk, soars to the azure sky,\nThe crane returns to the purple palace, its jade nest cold on high.\n\nDelighting in wind and moon above the three heavens’ height,\nYour lofty standard stands for all to see through time’s long night.\nI call again to the Daoist friends of Penglai’s isle,\nYet when we’ll meet again, who knows? The phoenix waits awhile.\n\n*To Master Wang, Who Turned from the Dao to Scholarship*\n\nYou’ve pored over the Three Tombs, pondered the Nine Thoughts’ maze,\nYet in the end, your plans fell short, your toil brought scant praise.\nBetter to follow Confucius’ Four Dhyānas’ way,\nOr honor Lü’s Hundred-Character Poem each day.\n\nWhen the Seven Returns and Nine Cycles’ work is done,\nWhen the Three Vehicles’ One Perfection’s course is run,\nBeneath the azure sky, the bright moon clears the heart,\nHow I envy your success, your laurel branch’s art!\n\n*Early Winter’s Feelings*\n\nAutumn’s light has faded, winter follows fast,\nThe Northern Emperor’s work brings chill at last.\nWhite grass fills the three paths, intertwined,\nCrimson clouds darken as the six-petaled snow is twined.\n\nAwaken to truth—alas, too late the call,\nBegin to cultivate—too slow, the fall.\nI sigh for the drifting red leaves’ flight,\nFor returning to the origin is like entering the kiln’s light.\n\n*Snow*\n\nThe crimson clouds gather as if by fate,\nThe wind drives the flying snow to every state.\nReed banks and islets share the silver hue,\nWild trees and plum blossoms wear the same white view.\n\nI begrudge Sun Gong’s night beyond the window pane,\nI resent Han Qi’s snow before his horse’s mane.\nBy the tea’s warmth, the smoke curls, no other care,\nI speak of immortal flowers on the leaves laid bare.\n\n*On the Beginning and End of Cultivation*\n\nDeluded disciples seek the Daoist’s way,\nRefine pure yang to perfection, then stay.\nA three-foot sack holds boundless delight,\nA single staff sweeps all sorrow away.\n\nGreen mountains invite—dwell in ease,\nGreen waters beckon—roam with grace.\nIf a guest asks where my path leads,\nI smile in silence, point to the clouds’ embrace.",

      "translated_text": "**In Response to Wang Zhiyin’s \"Early Spring\"**\n\nThe alchemy of creation knows renewal’s art,\nThe cauldron’s fresh spring glows with radiant heart.\nWarblers ascend to lofty boughs on soft breeze,\nSwallows near nests find the sun’s slow reprise.\n\nHalf-rain, half-shine—peach blossoms bare their face,\nLight chill, light warmth—willows unfurl with grace.\nEach year we meet, each year we age anew,\nFor whom do white hairs toil, and fame accrue?\n\n**Admonishing a Friend Moved by Spring**\n\nWhy grieve, my friend, at spring’s return in vain?\nWhat sorrow lurks where spring’s own light doth reign?\nEach year we greet, each year we bid adieu,\nA hundred pass, and all must fade from view.\n\nOld sins dissolve in verdant knots anew,\nLest future lives be lost to deeds we rue.\nA hand’s span holds the bliss of paradise,\nYet few unlock its gates to wander twice.\n\n**Heaven’s Dao in Harmonious Spring**\n\nThe Way unfolds in spring’s unhurried turn,\nHeaven and Earth in balanced concord burn.\nRoots gilded lie within the Five Phases’ mold,\nSprouts nurtured thrive where twin qi’s warmth is told.\n\nFlutes trill in painted towers on whispers light,\nHooves clatter on purple paths through misted night.\nYet mark: all fruit succeeds the bloom’s embrace,\nAnd strength is rooted deep in steadfast base.\n\n**The Inexorable Push of Impermanence**\n\nGrim specters drive, relentless in their claim,\nA thousand gold won’t buy a fleeting name.\nThe rich will never bear the poor man’s plight,\nNor can tomorrow grasp today’s last light.\n\nDeserted crimson towers, courtyards still,\nEndless black mists at the ghostly gate’s chill.\nOh, how the bitter grief wells up anew—\nAll born from loves that once our hearts once knew.\n\n**Admonition Against Wine**\n\nSince ancient days, men curse old Du Kang’s brew,\nYet still they drink, though ruin it may strew.\nIt rots the liver, sears the lungs with pain,\nTorments the gut—no cure, no balm, no gain.\n\nIt stirs the waves that drown the soul’s fair stream,\nA scalding bath that shames the waking dream.\nI urge you: drink, but never to excess,\nFor though it spares none, harm begins with self.\n\n**Lament for Calamities of Flood and Drought**\n\nWhen yin and yang in heaven’s breath misalign,\nMankind’s own sins the wrath of nature twine.\nThe poor dissemble, knaves deceive and cheat,\nThe rich grow wanton, nobles haughty greet.\n\nSummer’s chill freezes, winter’s heat oppresses,\nRain turns to drought, and drought to barren stresses.\nFamine breeds plague, yet heaven stays unkind,\nNo mercy shown for deeds of humankind.\n\n**To Master Liu After Long Parting**\n\nA decade passed since last your face I knew,\nYet longing lingers, etched in heart’s deep hue.\nThough fine days come, old songs we may reprise,\nNo breeze now bears the verses I devise.\n\nThough dreams may bring you near, words fail to reach,\nOur bodies part, yet minds remain in each.\nHow oft at crossroads grief has torn my breast—\nSoft spring winds blow, the sun lingers west.\n\n**To Master Zhang**\n\nYou dwell in western hills, bound by duty’s chain,\nNo word from you, no crane-borne news to gain.\nBody and mind drift like spring’s floating down,\nFootsteps wander like autumn’s tumbling brown.\n\nThe Six Repositories stay pure, untouched by dust,\nThe Three Isles’ paths lie veiled in mist and rust.\nTake one step on the clouds—lest slumber claim,\nAnd time reduce you to a hoary frame.\n\n**Early Summer Rain at Hejin**\n\nSummer’s first rains enrich the farmer’s store,\nNo boast of plenty—yet abundance’s door.\nMulberry boughs half-crimson, fragrant, bright,\nCherries near ripe, cradled in crimson light.\n\nPeppercorns swell in courtyards front and back,\nWheat blooms in fields both north and south’s expanse.\nThrough emerald willows, verdant locusts’ shade,\nThe spinning wheels hum on without a pause.\n\n**Summer Day in a Mountain Hall**\n\nThe mountain hall lies still in summer’s deep,\nA draught of coolness cleanses dust to sleep.\nI loosen robes to sit on riverside stone,\nLean on my staff to walk where willows’ shade has grown.\n\nI pluck wild blooms to lure the butterflies,\nStrike bamboo hard to startle birds that rise.\nEnthralled by clouds, I draw the boy’s mocking laugh—\nUnseen, the sun now dips to western half.\n\n**Passing the Days**\n\nDrifting, drifting through the fleeting hours,\nI seek no fame, nor chase the gnat-like powers.\nBy night, I tend the furnace’s threefold flame,\nBy dawn, I pluck the zither’s tranquil claim.\n\nThe cuckoo’s cry shatters the dream of Hua Xu,\nThe Qi maiden’s call rouses the meditative view.\nWho knows the art of this unhurried life?\nTo forge white jade and mold it into gold.\n\n**To Master Chen, the Preceptor**\n\nSince parting, your abode seems lost in mist,\nMy thoughts take flight like crows to southern tryst.\nMists veil the winding streams in layered gray,\nClouds mirror peaks that rise and fall away.\n\nThe inkstone gathers dust, its sheen now dim,\nNo guests cross the gate, barred since dawn’s first hymn.\nI shift my seat on rush mat, staff in hand,\nGaze north, stroke my beard, and long to ascend.\n\n**Farewell to Marshal Shi**\n\nOur bond was bright, our joy in life complete,\nYet honor’s weight and shame brought fear to meet.\nThough weak my arm to steer the chariot’s wheel,\nMy throat still holds the rooster’s clarion peal.\n\nIn speech, we shared the fire of loyalty,\nIn word, our trust grew ever steadfastly.\nI point to fine days, hoping we may meet,\nBut life and death deny our hearts’ deceit.\n\n**Expressing My Feelings**\n\nWhy bow the head or bend the knee in vain?\nGreen hills and clouds—no distant path to gain.\nOld pines defy the frost’s unyielding bite,\nUncut jade fears no furnace’s fierce light.\n\nThe cock’s crow carries three leagues’ sound,\nThe crane’s call pierces ninefold heaven’s ground.\nForgotten, fame and shame—what joy remains?\nTo hold the Dao, wear cap and crown, in silence reigns.\n\n**Seeking Master Chen, the Preceptor Afar**\n\nMy soles grow calloused, drenched in sweat like rain,\nYet undeterred, I seek my friend again.\nFor righteousness, I’d bear a mountain’s weight,\nFor kindness, plumb the seas’ uncharted state.\n\nThe idler’s nature grinds the guest’s resolve,\nThe sage’s heart the sage’s heart evolves.\nUpon the mat, the wind’s high price I pay—\nOne smile repays a debt of thousand gold.\n\n**Warning: Power’s Transience**\n\nAffairs of men know rise and fall’s decree,\nWinter departs, spring comes eternally.\nWaves churn to ripples, then disperse in air,\nClouds veil the rain, then hide the sun’s bright glare.\n\nThe future points—its term is nearly

in the Cold**\n\nOn the Double Ninth, wind stirs the leaves with a mournful sigh,\nCold’s bite pierces my tattered robe.\nMy flesh bristles with the chill’s sharp sting,\nMy teeth chatter as I chant poems to greet the noble.\nI bear a thousand verses, deep in intent,\nYet he plucks not a single hair in return.\nWorse still, reckless friends show no pity—\nThey rap my gate with staffs, calling me to climb the heights.\n\n**Master Pei’s Transcendence**\n\nLast night, golden youths bore a decree in my dream,\nThis morn, Master Pei ascends as an immortal.\nHis spirit, unbound, returns to truth,\nHis fourfold form, dignified, remains serene.\nWith dragon’s might, he leaps into the sea isles,\nWith crane’s strength, he soars to the heavens’ net.\nFrom this day forth, cultivators of truth—\nFew may stand beside him.\n\n**Lamenting the End of Worldly Ambition**\n\nOnce I played the gallant, learned the ways of the world,\nNow old, all things fade—nothing remains.\nFame and gain flow away like water,\nRight and wrong are swept up with falling blossoms.\nI grow weary of wind and moon, shun poetry circles,\nFear the madness of wine, avoid the taverns.\nIf guests speak of honor and disgrace,\nI seal my lips and shake my head.\n\n**Admonishing Disciples on My Aspirations**\n\nDrunk on elixirs outside my thatched hut,\nI wander a realm apart, proving my skill.\nA crimson dragon I ride, steady through golden gates,\nA dark crane supports me as I mount the jade flask.\nWhen the myriad changes settle, the Three Realms grow still,\nThe nine heavens’ clear sun stands alone.\nHow many cultivators of truth know this?\nHave they grasped this family’s way?\n\n**Warning the World**\n\nIn troubled times, straight ministers’ plans go unused,\nKnowing the glue-pot’s trap, why risk shaving your head?\nHan, Marquis of Yunmeng, was slain though blameless,\nBai Qi of Du’ou was imprisoned despite his merit.\nBeneath the green pines, temples stand high and low,\nBy fragrant grassy banks, new and old graves lie.\nLook to the steles—observe their fates:\nNot one meets the heart’s desire.\n\n**Exhorting the Worldly to Know Their Limits**\n\nThe world’s eyes struggle to glimpse the Daoist’s path,\nYet within, a wondrous mechanism turns.\nOne loss: the bright moon, pure in mid-heaven,\nTwo gains: the spirit’s light, gathered within.\nHexagrams’ lines, long or short, mend and split,\nFire and water of bing and geng ebb and flow.\nWhen spring thunder shakes the vast expanse,\nThe pure body roams freely to heaven’s end.\n\n**Having Failed to Achieve Fame and Success**\n\nI saw ambition would not bear fruit,\nSo I returned—honor and shame no longer surprise me.\nWithin, I gather my pupils, cease gazing at forms,\nWithout, I lock my tongue, make no sound.\nMy heart is still as a half-pole of pond water,\nMy body drifts like a wisp of wild cloud.\nRecalling past affairs, I laugh to the sky—\nNearly trapped by empty blossoms for a lifetime.\n\n**To My Disciples: The Master’s Study of Books**\n\nWhy does the master shun his thatched hut,\nShunning the Dao to cling to the Confucians?\nGreedily he covets the Three Rites on his shelves,\nHeedless of the seven treasures in his flask.\nFiercely he scolds those who seek glory and gain,\nUnknowing of the effortless work of contention.\nHis aged frame, his ailing eyes draw near—\nSurely he sighs, lamenting his folly.\n\n**Admonishing the Stubborn**\n\nTo learn the Dao, first be steadfast and firm,\nBut stubbornness makes you a tyrant.\nXiangru yielded the road, forgetting his pride,\nLian Po bore the thorns, begging forgiveness.\nHarmony’s gentlest breath pierces the earth,\nA spring’s weak flow cuts through high ridges.\nTo be humble is to gain—never faulted,\nTo defy the crowd is to court great misfortune.\n\n**Self-Delight**\n\nI break earth’s net, strike heaven’s gate,\nRide a flying dragon at will.\nMy eyes know this as utmost bliss,\nMy seat reveals Penglai’s peak.\nThe sun and moon rush on, let them speed,\nMy true nature abides in tranquil ease.\nWhat is done or undone—why heed it?\nLet white hair laugh with abandon.\n\n**Inquiring of My Daoist Brothers on the Dharma**\n\nAsk not of your heart’s affairs—why fret?\nTo truly cultivate, you must meet truth.\nLet the teaching rain wash the filth from your heart,\nLet the Dao’s wind scatter the dust from your eyes.\nOne flask transforms dreams within dreams,\nThe Three Realms fly with bodies beyond bodies.\nIf you still doubt this mystery,\nWhat else shall we call the yang spirit?\n\n**Warning Against Delusion**\n\nI sought the Dao, I studied Chan,\nWandered mountains and clouds, losing count of years.\nMonks boast of their Buddha-seed,\nDaoists prattle of immortals.\nThe Six Classics and Ten Treatises—mere words,\nThe seven returns and nine refinements—falsely transmitted.\nBound in this skin-bag’s prison,\nThey still speak of \"before parents were born.\"\n\n**To Lei Youzhi, Ill After the Great Army’s Retreat**\n\nHeaven’s net is vast, its mesh secure—\nWho finds lasting peace beneath its cover?\nHow many partings, how many regrets?\nEach rise and fall leaves only emptiness.\nOn wind-swept paths, corpses still lie,\nOn rain-washed battlefields, blood remains red.\nAsk the tiger-faced warriors of those years—\nHow many have lived to see white hair?\n\n**Self-Admonition: Cherishing Life**\n\nIn chaotic times, in cruel years, I know well enough—\nWithdraw your head, follow your lot, nurture true desire.\nOnce, there were countless youths,\nNow, only one or two old reeds remain.\nLife has no root—like a fish on a hook,\nThe body is bound—like a silkworm in its cocoon.\nFate’s rise and fall are fixed, without error,\nDo not let greed deceive your heart.\n\n**On the Dao**\n\nThe pearl of nature, formless, holds profound mystery,\nAdapting freely, it moves with nature.\nAll directions are clear, utterly transparent,\nAll things are embraced, the body follows their patterns.\nHidden, it retreats to the infinitesimal,\nManifest, it fills heaven and earth.\nIt is but one unobstructed thing—\nIts wondrous power knows no bounds.\n\n**Admonishing Greed**\n\nGreed’s coils bind the body—hear the sighs!\nOnly then do you know the earth’s snares bring harm.\nFear the needle before your eyes—cultivate thorns,\nDread the pit before your path—beware the trench.\nDisaster is born from fools’ blessings,\nFortune arises from the wise amid calamity.\nIf heroes do not judge in secret,\nXiang Yu and King Wu would rise again.\n\n**On the Perils of Delusion**\n\nTo speak of the profound’s inversions,\nYou must wander the heavens within the heavens.\nIf the heart still clings to things, do not discuss the Dao,\nIf nature has no root, do not speak of Chan.\nThe first stage does not plant lotuses in mud,\nHow then can the last bear water’s lilies?\nDo not wildly guess at sacred texts—\nLest your body incur the sin of false speech.\n\n**Song Master’s Teachings at the Yellow River**\n\nParting the clouds, he expounded widely among men,\nTwice he returned to the Yellow River in a year.\nHis virtue’s light opened the nine hells,\nHis compassion’s power shook the three mountains.",

      "translated_text": "**Breath and Pulse: The Alchemy of Yin and Yang**\n\nInhaling Kan, exhaling Li—yin and yang transform,\nWind and cloud unfurl and coil, heaven and earth at ease.\nLet this be known to all the world hereafter:\nThose who turn not toward goodness grow ever more foolish and stubborn.\n\n**Night Sitting**\n\nThe long night deepens at the third watch,\nMy subtle form soars forth from Jade Capital.\nWild clouds rejoice, a thousand miles of purity,\nMoonlight spills like a full wheel’s brilliance.\nSilver stars dot the frosty gleam,\nThe azure river runs clear, vast qi serene.\nWhy does the sun-crow leave the sea at dawn?\nA single bell’s toll startles the first meditation.\n\n**Realm of Joy**\n\nThe profound Dao lies within inward vision,\nBland as if tasteless, yet true joy abides.\nA pure breeze carries qi beyond the three mountains,\nBright moonlight flies, illuminating ten thousand miles.\nUnconstrained, I ascend to transformations,\nWhat need to distinguish inner from outer in this blissful roaming?\nAwakened, to whom could I speak alone?\nAll is entrusted to the pine winds’ plucked melody.\n\n**The Dao Is Not Two**\n\nBuddhism and Daoism share one source from the beginning,\nTathāgata and Laozi ascend heaven together.\nAn arrow pierces the iron drum, concealing deep principle,\nThe furnace refines golden elixir, veiling supreme mystery.\nThe white horse arrives bearing secret teachings,\nThe blue ox strides west, expounding true meaning.\nYet now, in this age, the black-robed and yellow-capped\nVainly pore over cinnabar texts and Buddhist scriptures.\n\n**In Praise of Knowing Advance and Retreat**\n\nAt leisure, I point backward to instruct the heroic:\nXiang Yu and King Liu—one move too high.\nThree scrolls of sacred writ held secrets at Gaixia,\nA single divine stratagem enabled escape at Kuaiji.\nXi Shi’s coquetry ensnared the roc’s net,\nEmpress Lü’s schemes emptily trapped the tiger’s den.\nSmall wit scheming great affairs\nIs like fish bait seeking to hook the whale.\n\n**Answering One Who Asks About Leisure**\n\nHaving admired the forests and springs’ carefree ease,\nI take up bowl and staff to companion green mountains.\nThree scrolls—*Yinfu*, *Daode*, and *Scripture*—\nTwo rooms—door of reeds, window of mulberry.\nSpirit birds of the Purple Palace diligently ferry me,\nThe leisurely chariot of Cinnabar Mountain swiftly follows.\nAt peace, my heart holds no lingering affairs,\nPine winds fill the courtyard as I close the gate at noon.\n\n**Visiting the Tombs of Immortals Zhao and Bai with Reverence**\n\nLate at night, incense coils from the precious stove,\nFacing the mounds, I lay bare my liver to supplicate the two masters.\nEight hundred deeds of cultivation—on what day were they perfected?\nThree thousand merits of toil—at what hour were they completed?\nWithin the world, Penglai’s isles remain hard to glimpse,\nBeyond the world, the heavens’ net is not easily known.\nI pray to enter dreams for clear revelation,\nTo cast aside this body and await the return to the Dao.\n\n**Yin Cong Entrusts His Tomb and Asks About Conduct**\n\nWith reverent heart, I light a stove of incense before the mound.\nThirty years of steadfast poverty, trembling through countless trials.\nIn motion and stillness, sitting and lying—my hundred bones age,\nIn roaming, resting, concealing, and cultivating—my temples frost.\nOne move toward non-being remains unfinished,\nDisloyal and unfilial—whose sin is this?\n\n**Met with Rejection by Others**\n\nCarrying a twin staff, a body like a wisp of cloud,\nI’ve drifted the world’s edges for twenty springs.\nGreen temples once sought the *Cantong* with great benefit,\nNow, silver-haired, I return home—no neighbors near.\nWill vermilion gates deign to glance at a thatched-door guest?\nWho pities the fox-fur-clad man in coarse hemp?\nThe immortal isles of the sea remain beyond reach,\nI endure both stretching and bending, nurturing natural truth.\n\n**Delighting in Poverty**\n\nThe fourth watch’s drum fades, the market’s clamor stills,\nI sleep soundly, carefree in my humble state.\nA scrap of paper covers a stone pillow,\nA rush mat spreads over a mound of silk floss.\nSometimes I follow white cranes to Penglai’s isles,\nSuddenly I ride a vermilion dragon to peer into grotto-heavens.\nSuch words are hard to speak in the world of men—\nVainly do fame and profit mock the wind-tossed madman.\n\n**Mid-Autumn Moon Gazing**\n\nClouds disperse, dust settles—half the autumn sky,\nStars and constellations distinct, the moon perfectly round.\nWho plays the flute atop the white jade tower?\nWithin the crystal palace, I tune my strings.\nLuminous as floating ice over sea and peaks,\nIts light immerses heaven and earth in crystalline clarity.\nSince ancient times, only this night each year—\nWhere in the world do men not stay up late?\n\n**To Prefect Li of Pingyang**\n\nThe people wail, their suffering unbearable,\nYet when a great official passes, their cold turns to warmth.\nGentle words soothe customs, adding to winter’s quilts,\nVirtue’s moisture nourishes the thirsty like sweet broth.\nWherever he goes, no harsh winds or rains,\nEverywhere his name sprays the fragrance of musk and orchid.\nHis flowing influence spares the vermilion gates from fear,\nThey hear only the thunderous sound of imperial favor’s light.\n\n**Seeing Off Wang Jinzhi**\n\nParting cups shimmer, sending off a dear friend,\nGrasping hands, sorrow spills tears upon our robes.\nNarrow paths and perilous bridges demand caution,\nAmid chaotic mountains and lone inns, guard your heart.\nCrimson leaves of fading glow stretch to distant hamlets,\nDawn’s light and crisp frost deepen the wild fields.\nStaff and sandals wander cloud and water’s vast expanse,\nWhen will our emotions again seek the ant’s incense?\n\n**Admonishing Master Yang**\n\nWith you, I speak especially of conduct and concealment:\nThe Dao resides in pure poverty—stand firm.\nTightly seal the five passes, and the body benefits,\nCarefully uphold the three treasures, and your path is unimpeded.\nRecommending the worthy and praising the good brings double beauty,\nComforting yourself while slandering others must wound both.\nWhat the noble man does is worth emulating—\nNaturally, fortune’s vines will stretch to the heavens.\n\n**The Daoist’s Actions Are Extraordinary**\n\nVirtue must be humble, will must be steadfast.\nThe wisdom-blade swings high, demons flee,\nThe elixir pellet glows, myriad evils hide.\nWithin the five-hued cauldron, golden medicine simmers,\nIn the seven-jeweled furnace, jade nectar refines.\nTrue cultivation of creation forges a robust body,\nThe path through heaven and earth stands majestic.\n\n**Lamenting the Times**\n\nDeparting the dust for the Dao, do not let your heart stray,\nHeaven and earth shift, the world changes.\nPetty men grow ever more cunning with each passing day,\nThe modest gentleman’s Dao dwindles in this age.\nAshen-hearted, he yields the seal after three pleas,\nIce-lipped, he declines gold, fearing the four who know.\nMostly, leave the threads of karma unheeded—\nBetter to sit like a clod, delighting in non-action.\n\n**Inducing the Multitude**\n\nThe art of immortal study holds wondrous mechanisms,\nAll within the questions of creation’s becoming.\nWater and fire shift—meet and return,\nWood and metal move—encounter and revert.\nA single wheel of sun and moon, yin and yang’s breath,\nThe six directions of heaven and earth lie at ease.\nMaster this practice,\nAnd you will know Penglai’s peaks arise everywhere.\n\n**Admonishing Disciples**\n\nTongue sharp, heart stubborn—students of the Dao,\nI urge and warn you: do not give way to anger.\nYouth’s spring silently departs, year by year you age,\nWhite hair stealthily arrives, day by day it renews.\nLove and attachment add grime to the heart,\nGlory’s sights gather dust in the eyes.\nOne morning, original truth dissipates entirely,\nProstrate on your pillow, you’ll vainly sigh for the distant Dao.\n\n**Warning Against Wasted Years**\n\nBack then, I angled for you—why did you not turn your head?\nEven if you turn now, cultivation is still delusion.\nSeeking fish in trees, toiling dawn to dusk,\nCatching the moon in water, passing spring and autumn.\nAt that time, had you angled and not turned away,\nThough you turn now, cultivation remains in vain.\nFishing in trees from dawn to dusk,\nGrasping at the moon in water through the seasons.",

      "translated_text": "**On the Fleeting Nature of Life**\n\nHonors and humiliations in darkness and light—brief as dreams,\nHow much sorrow in the stench of the divine, the withering of glory?\nWipe the bronze mirror, behold the hoary hair:\nThis year it thickens more than the last.\n\nThe tattered robe—threadbare, not a single seam holds,\nSeek its warp and weft, and none can be worn.\nFour seams square as the four apertures, round as the round,\nTwo sleeves long and dangling, then short again.\nWash away the grime—strip by strip it follows the water,\nBrush off the dust—flake by flake it chases the wind’s crest.\nNow I sleep in moonlight, nestle in clouds,\nUtterly bare, I pass my late years.\n\n**Warning Against Misinterpreting the *Yuanjue Sutra***\n\nThe true *Yuanjue Sutra* cannot be spoken,\nForced discourse on it wastes effort.\nEmpty *yuanjue* leaves no trace,\nGreat awakening’s perfection defies all models.\nDrowning and surfacing—vain gathering and scattering,\nClouds come and go—endless chasing.\nKnow that silence is the truest speech,\nYet none dare spread their mats before others.\n\n**Night Sitting in Liaoyang Palace**\n\nAlone I sit in Liaoyang as night deepens,\nThe Silver River gleams cold, the moon’s light chills.\nThe zither plays \"Breaking the Cassia\"—the Moon Goddess listens,\nThe sword dances to slay dragons—ghosts and demons watch.\nEight-sided and clear as ice, the mirror’s expanse,\nOne sky serene as a jade flask, boundless.\nHow many worldly men chase profit and fame?\nThey know not the gourd and ladle that cradle the Great Elixir.\n\n**Warning Against Misreading Books**\n\nWild guesses and reckless interpretations deceive in discourse,\nFailing to recognize the true, constant Dao’s root.\nScooping mud from the road to wipe a pile of dung,\nRinsing a glue pot with lacquered water.\nZhang Liang points to Meng Liang’s uncle,\nYangzi calls them the descendants of Liuzi.\nThey aspire to ascend the hall and enter the chamber,\nYet how many gates still lie between?\n\n**Admonition to Daoists: Leave Your Hometown**\n\nFor cultivation, it is crucial to leave your homeland,\nWithout traversing cloud-capped mountains, the Dao is hindered.\nMoonlight reaches the sky—utterly bright,\nWater flows to the sea—naturally vast.\nWillow fluff drifts south and north,\nThe ant and snail abandon their quarrels over length.\nWith no firewood beneath the cauldron, the flame dies of itself—\nWhy labor to stir boiling water?\n\n**Warning Against Private Schemes in the Hermitage**\n\nDo not rejoice too much in joy, nor grieve too much in sorrow,\nThis six-foot frame is but a bubble on water.\nToday’s joy—rejoice today,\nTomorrow’s sorrow—grieve tomorrow.\nOne breath unpassed, and you are rotting bones,\nHalf a speck of skin stinks—a skeleton.\nThe sages’ teachings feign deafness and blindness,\nWillingly serving as horses and oxen for children and grandchildren.\n\n**Warning Against Reckless Cultivation**\n\nTo study the Dao, one must refine jade and gold,\nThe true breath of Heaven’s origin runs deep.\nSeek not at the root’s fixed stem,\nNor vainly chase the blossoms’ empty tips.\nFocus *qi*, preserve essence—fill the belly,\nEmbrace the origin, guard the One—empty the heart.\nHow many suffer from wakeful illness,\nYet refuse to administer a single needle’s cure?\n\n**Warning to Qin Zhongnan and Shu Yongle**\n\nThe yellow root’s dream ends—teachings become the foundation,\nClouds point to Chongyang as the patriarch.\nA thousand *li* to Zhongnan, the heart rejoices to go,\nYet a single journey to Yongle, the feet grow weary.\nTruth is seen only after the flowers,\nThe root precedes the sprout—so it has ever been.\nThe old folk rhyme now proves true:\nOnly then does one know—layer by layer, skin upon skin.\n\n**Resting in the Pure Yang Palace on a Summer Day**\n\nWho does not dread the scorching summer sun?\nThe meditation couch, the pine wind—cool and refreshing.\nTea and milk fill the cup, clear dew glistens,\nSandalwood smoke curls into a canopy, white clouds fragrant.\nWithin nature, form and emptiness merge,\nBeyond the heart, worldly toil is forgotten in sitting.\nGazing outward, the ridges of Tiaoshan—clouds scatter,\nThe sun shifts, flower shadows climb the eastern wall.\n\n**Admonition to Liu Zigao**\n\nThe Daoist’s bearing is distinct, his conduct steadfast,\nUnashamed to wear a threadbare, patched robe all his life.\nBeyond the world, he fixes his heart on friends beyond the world,\nIn the world, he engages with those of the world.\nHis will must be as yielding as the waters of Linzhou,\nHis *qi* must rise like Mount Taihua’s heights.\nDare I ask of later words—do not retreat or falter,\nFor I have sworn to use the fish’s bait to hook the whale and leviathan.\n\n**Escaping the Heat at the Stork and Sparrow Tower**\n\nAtop the Stork and Sparrow Tower, the heat does not reach,\nA gentle southern breeze pierces the heart’s field.\nDust and earth—each grain falls away,\nA thousand *li* of mountains and rivers come before the eyes.\nLying down, I drink the pure wind—my heart drunk on the Dao,\nSitting in forgetfulness, the turbid realm—my nature at peace in meditation.\nThe hues of Zhongtiao Mountain half in fading light,\nCrimson and green intertwine, threading the evening mist.\n\n**Wandering the Mountain Hermitage**\n\nThe secluded mountain hermitage veiled in mist,\nClouds seal the hidden path, water flows east and west.\nAfter rain by the stream, monkeys pluck fruit,\nIn the sun-warmed pines, cranes preen in the wind.\nThe old man tends herbs in the garden plots,\nChildren play at gathering lingzhi beneath the boulders.\nOne day, I’ll cast aside worldly affairs,\nExhale rainbow breath, return to the Great Void.\n\n**Reflections in Old Age**\n\nWhite hair and a scholar’s cap—nothing suits me now,\nDaily I sleep late, rise even later.\nMoon waxing and waning—how many times have I seen it?\nWho is humbled, who is honored—I know not.\nIdle talk of the noble man’s words,\nWild chanting of the Daoist’s poems beyond the world.\nA lifetime unconcerned with the floating life’s reckoning,\nBeyond this non-action—nothing is done.\n\n**Warning Against Greed and Abuse of Power**\n\nUnreasonable greed runs to excess,\nThe heart’s nets and snares bitterly ensnare.\nHeat and cold still shift with the four seasons,\nDay and night still follow the solstices.\nFilling the sea—Xufu’s efforts crumble to laughter,\nMoving mountains—Zifang’s strength is spent in song.\nDo not say success and failure are man-made,\nWhen the tally is done—what can be done?\n\n**Warning Against Blind Study**\n\nThe Dao relies on a bright teacher’s guidance to the end,\nYet others’ cases are still sought out.\nTo ascend to heaven, one must borrow the ascent lamp,\nTo cross the sea, one must rely on the crossing boat.\nAll things arise from their origin,\nGrass waves ripple from their source.\nHow pitiful—the ant’s admiration of blind cultivation,\nThe mad swallow’s frenzied play in the mirage’s tower.\n\n**Returning Home**\n\nIn years past, I wandered east and west in search of the Dao,\nToday, gourd and ladle return to my village.\nI can but roll up my ambitions, hide my striving,\nI cannot bear to speak of poverty and success.\nHuman feelings—warm and cool, fragrant and distinct,\nWorldly affairs—rise and fall, ever changing.\nHow many in fox-fur and sable hats?\nAt Ba Ling, their news—still puffed with arrogance.\n\n**Admonition to Disciples: Embrace Labor**\n\nDo not shirk the toil of worldly dust—it accumulates blessings,\nTo rise high, one must take the low as foundation.\nActivities do not hinder heaven and earth’s union,\nMovement does not obstruct the sun and moon’s course.\nThe four *dhyānas* of *yuanjue* settle in sequence,\nThe three thieves of the *Yinfu* naturally align.\nOne truth, unwavering from beginning to end,\nOver time, within the void, a child is nurtured.\n\n**Mid-Autumn Night**\n\nThe wind parts the cloud curtain—mid-autumn arrives,\nI pull a friend, carry the zither, feast in the small tower.",
      "overlap_context": "Prostrate on your pillow, you’ll vainly sigh for the distant Dao.\n\n**Warning Against Wasted Years**\n\nBack then, I angled for you—why did you not turn your head?\nEven if you turn now, cultivation is still delusion.\nSeeking fish in trees, toiling dawn to dusk,\nCatching the moon in water, passing spring and autumn.\nAt that time, had you angled and not turned away,\nThough you turn now, cultivation remains in vain.\nFishing in trees from dawn to dusk,\nGrasping at the moon in water through the seasons.",

      "translated_text": "A Day’s Accumulation Becomes a Sin of Full Measure\nTo whom shall the karmic debt be repaid?\n\n**Admonition Against Summoning Future Misfortune**\nNine-tenths of loyal words miss their mark,\nTo one’s face they feign compliance, behind one’s back they turn to demons.\nFan Li awakened in time and escaped later calamity,\nFuchai saw only the shame of Wu Zixu.\n\n**Despising Fame and Profit**\nReturn, come away—snow crowns your head,\nThe heart’s craving for fame and profit suddenly ceases.\nSeizing the moment to settle the debt of rebirth,\nThis life, at least, gains one move ahead.\n\n**Secluded Dwelling**\nBalustrades of several stalks of gentlemanly bamboo,\nLow windows with a few scrolls of the Sage’s books.\nThe dream of roaming immortals breaks as pine shadows shift,\nOne strum of the zither brings more than enough joy.\n\n**Inner Skill**\nBlowing red, a furnace of fire at the sea’s bottom,\nMelting away two sheets of ice atop the mountain.\nWhen the fire extinguishes itself, the ice vanishes of itself,\nSunlight and moonlight together shine in perfect clarity.\n\n**Lament for the Treasure of the Dao**\nForging and shaping the great unhewn jade is one’s livelihood,\nIts radiance illumines past and present without blemish.\nLet it go, draw it back—the cosmos grows narrow,\nIts towering spiritual use knows no bounds.\n\n**Later Tuning the Zither**\nCasually tuning the zither at leisure,\nSitting close to the brazier’s fire, freely at ease.\nEnamored of the crystalline melodies beyond the frets,\nHeedless of the unmelted snow at the gate.\n\n**Daytime Repose**\nDaytime slumber in the bright window—what bliss,\nNot a speck of dust or care lingers in the heart.\nSweetly half-awakened from a dream of roaming immortals,\nOnce more he gazes into the Gourd Heaven.\n\n**Traveling to Hezhong Prefecture After War**\nShun’s capital, its towers and pavilions once the finest under heaven,\nHow many times reduced to ashes, how many times rebuilt?\nOnly the foothills of Mount Tiao remain,\nMajestic as ever, passing through spring and autumn.\n\n**Western Pavilion of Liaoyang Palace**\nThe western pavilion stands high, its nature hazy,\nDrunk on the western wind, merging with the vastness of space.\nHow many true transformations occur within the void?\nJoyfully entrusted, unspoken.\n\nFar from the clamor of the western pavilion, distant from the city’s bustle,\nThe boundless Dharma realm I deeply cherish.\nWhen visitors from noble houses arrive, I am too weary to engage,\nAlone, I claim the title of idle one, feasting in seated meditation.\n\nIn the western pavilion, clouds rest as I pillow my head on books and sleep,\nA tiled censer with mountain incense wafts auspicious smoke.\nA single pure note pierces the ear,\nThe jade zither, stirred by the wind, rings out of its own accord.\n\n**Ascending the Stork Tower to View the River**\nOn earth, the long river; beneath heaven, the mountains,\nHeaven’s wrath stirs the waves into tumultuous return.\nHow much better the nameless guest upon the tower,\nUnmoved by wind or wave, at ease in idleness.\n\n**Summer Evening Inspiration**\nFrom the southern breeze, evening’s chill arises,\nRagged robes spread, zither laid across, facing the setting sun.\nThree refrains fade as the bright moon rises,\nA young servant comes to invite me for the evening incense burning.\n\n**After the First Rain of the Sacrificial Offering**\nSweet rain clears at dawn, the days grow long,\nA light chill still restrains the fragrant herbs.\nTo whom can one speak of the Dao’s joy in such scenes?\nAlone, I stand defiantly in the east wind, bathed in evening sunlight.\n\n**Early Morning at the Mouth of Liaoyang Terrace**\nSeveral chimes of the golden bell dispel the morning chill,\nThe dream of roaming immortals breaks—I cannot sleep.\nRising, I gaze at the moon atop Mount Taihua’s peak,\nIts slanting light immerses the shadow of Mount Tiao in the sky.\n\n**Wen the Scholar Inquires About the Dao**\nThe constant Dao is ever self-knowing,\nKnowing the constant, the Dao is non-action.\nNon-action attains what cannot be spoken,\nTo speak of the true and constant is to depart from the Dao.\n\n**Sent to Master Ren of Shannan**\nA decade of silence since our parting in worldly talk,\nHow often have I seen wild geese linger in their comings and goings?\nGazing until the wind and moon at the mountain’s edge fade,\nI imagine you, too, nurturing your lofty leisure in the same way.\n\n**Presented to Master Zhang Entering the Garden**\nRestrain body and foot to diligently practice the Dao,\nForget appearances and words to feast in seated meditation.\nGreat awakening, perfect penetration, illuminating the five eyes,\nNot departing from the present—this is the net of heaven.\n\n**Lament for the Hastening of Sun and Moon**\nJust past Mid-Autumn, the bright moon full,\nAgain comes the Double Ninth, the chrysanthemum’s season.\nThe four seasons tirelessly hasten one’s aging,\nStitching together one year after another.\n\n**Admonition Against Mourning**\nLife and death at dawn and dusk—no mistake in this,\nLong life or short, all is a dream of Nanke.\nFacing the deceased, do not stir thoughts of sorrow and grief,\nWhen it comes to your own turn, what can you do?\n\n**Revisiting Hezhong**\nForty years ago, I wandered this place,\nHow many times has its splendor changed through spring and autumn?\nThe Yellow River cares not for the rise and fall of mortal shells,\nAs ever, it surges and flows eastward.\n\n**Evening Stroll in Seclusion**\nHemp robe sweeping the ground, slender stalks tall,\nTreading through cloud-capped mountains as the evening sun sets.\nTurning back at dusk, incense and lamps extinguished,\nLaughing, I part the wind and moon to enter the meditation chamber.\n\n**Lament for Those Who Harm Others**\nThe cicada’s clamor on the pine branch shows no end,\nThe mantis’s claws and teeth are sharp as hooks.\nIts heart set only on the sweet taste of the cicada,\nHow could it heed the oriole lurking behind?\n\n**Clearly Guarding One’s Lot**\nIn this life, no grand deeds,\nEndowed with a nature too foolish.\nOne bowl of rice from a thousand households,\nThree winters in a hundred-patched robe.\nIn all things, ever content,\nIn every matter, never furrowed brow.\nWhy is poverty so steadfast?\nThe Primordial Origin speaks of frugality and compassion.\n\n**Praising Poverty on the Journey to Establish a Hermitage in Hejin in Autumn**\nStraw hat and rain cape, leaving mulberry and catalpa,\nThe season of frosted leaves has come.\nZither and books cast aside, my companions,\nBowl and alms-bowl, I seek other worthies.\nFrost invades the tiled bed,\nRain drips from the crumbling eaves.\nTiger and wolf tracks outside the door,\nMoss carpets the window.\nWalking, I marvel at the lane of Yan Yuan,\nSleeping, I nestle in the wool of Hou Ji.\nScarcely a dragon-tail inkstone,\nShelves bare of crow’s-head planks.\nDipping a worn brush,\nGrinding thick ink from a broken inkstick.\nInspired, I compose the biography of Yuan Xian,\nAt leisure, I peruse the writings of Fan Dan.\nNot resenting others’ deep generosity,\nEver mindful of my own meager virtue.\nFirm in poverty, my heart does not waver,\nEmbracing the Dao, my resolve grows stronger.\nSitting in profound obscurity,\nMeditating in silent stillness.\nThis illusory body nurtures the chamber of a fathom’s depth,\nMy true nature pierces the layers of mystery.\nWithin and without, fused as one,\nThroughout the vast cosmos, all is filled.\nThe five phases cannot alter creation,\nThe two qi cease their pressing urgency.\nThe realm of utmost joy and purity,\nA carefree, self-so immortal.\nThe wondrous mechanism defies description,\nSealed lips await heaven’s appointed years.\n\n**Admonition to Disciples**\nIn cultivation, do not be blind,\nDevote yourself with purity and sincerity.\nThough heaven may collapse, do not fear,\nThough earth may split, do not be startled.\nBelow, forget poverty and lowliness,\nAbove, hold nobles in disdain.\nAmidst clamor, seize stillness,\nWithin death, escape life.\nInternally, preserve the pure body,\nExternally, sever worldly ties.\nPerfectly illuminate the five eyes,\nAttain the fruit of the three vehicles.\nThese words I repeat as exhortation,\nMy brothers, my kin.\nThe phoenix soars in true flight,\nThe lame turtle lags behind.\nFlattery to one’s face, slander behind one’s back,\nWealth prized over righteousness.\nDelighting in the antics of apes,\nMimicking the squabbles of chickens.\nNature ensnared by sound and beauty,\nIntent fixed on fame and achievement.",
