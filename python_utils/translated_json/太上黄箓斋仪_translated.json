  "full_translation": "**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Yellow Register Fast Ritual*. Fifty-eight fascicles. Compiled by Du Guangting of the late Tang and Five Dynasties period. Base text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Dongxuan Section, *Weiyi* (Ritual Dignity) Category.\n\n**Fascicle One of The Supreme Yellow Register Fast Ritual**\nCompiled by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting\n\n**Ritual for Circumambulation at Dawn on the First Day**\n\nAccording to the old ritual, the fast’s sponsor was required to submit a petition daily, following the method of announcing the fast. However, since a petition was already submitted at the fast’s initial establishment, daily repetition would be excessive in observance. Thus, it shall be done only once, and all subsequent petitions shall cease.\n\nThe assembled officials arrange their positions, banners, tablets, and incense altars, standing in solemn order before the Mystic Master. Once settled, the cantor intones:\n\n*\"All participants in the Daoist hall, each turn your minds to take refuge in the Three Treasures and all revered ones—\"*\n\nThe *Huaxia Hymn* is chanted, leading to the *Huaxia Hymn at the Earth Gate*. The *Scripture of the Jade Casket Revealing Perfection* is recited. Now, only the eighteen empty sounds are used.\n\n**Hymn for Opening the Hall**\nWith diligence we uphold the fast and precepts,\nReciting scriptures to restrain the six passions.\nThus we ride the void in flight,\nRadiant, ascending to Jade Clarity.\nWith focused mind we honor the scriptural teachings,\nRefining the five spirits through exhaled nectar.\nOur merit crowns the heavens,\nTurning the wheel to ascend as immortals.\n\nThe *Entering the Gate Spell* is recited, proceeding to the left of the Earth Gate. The Dharma Master recites the esoteric incantation:\n\n*\"Officers of the Four Luminaries, Messengers Who Convey to Perfection, Jade Lads Who Transmit Words, Jade Maidens Who Serve in Stillness—convey my words to the presiding deities of the Daoist chamber. May the qi of the Upper Prime enter my body.\"*\n\nThe *Huaxia Hymn* is chanted, leading into the altar. Ascending the Heavenly Gate, the procession begins with the incense offering to the ten directions, starting in the east. Upon reaching the imperial table, incense is offered thrice.\n\n**Esoteric Incantation for Offering Incense**\n\nAmidst jade radiance scattering light, each pays homage and visualizes as prescribed. The Dharma Master closes his eyes and envisions the Supreme Three Honored Ones descending through the void, flanked by dragon and tiger, with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders. The revered spirits of the Three Realms and the assembled perfected attendants array themselves at their seats. Thereupon, on behalf of the disciples, he presents the intent of the fast.\n\nNext, he visualizes the Scripture Master attending to the right of the Supreme Ones, bowing thrice in his heart, wishing that the master attain the Dao of immortality and that his own body ascend and be delivered. Then he visualizes the Register Master, followed by the Ordination Master, with wishes as before.\n\nFor the night rite, he next envisions azure qi suffusing the fast hall, with green dragons and lions guarding front and rear. Immortal lads and jade maidens, heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, flying immortals, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the five Thearchs’ troops and horses, nine hundred million riders, overseers of the fast’s affairs, and the officials of the Three Realms array themselves to left and right.\n\nThen he envisions azure qi issuing from the master’s liver like clouds ascending. Within the azure qi are green dragons and lions. Heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, flying immortals, and the Five Thearchs of the five directions, with their troops and horses, envelop the bodies of the fast’s host and his household. Again, he visualizes the five viscera and the Five Marchmounts’ Five Thearchs, as in the initial night rite.\n\n**Incantation for Guarding the Spirits**\n*\"Golden Perfected and verdant auroras\nillumine and reflect the Three Heavens.\nFlying clouds in the cinnabar firmament,\nall heavens command their chariots.\nMorning brilliance dawns,\ndark shadows dissolve entirely.\nNinefold subtleties shake the void,\nfive stars revolve in cycles.\nMyriad immortals respond to the resonance,\nnaturally wondrous and mysterious.\nIn the distant obscurity, radiance scatters,\nshapes divide into billions.\nVeiled in luminous splendor,\nauspiciousness descends upon the altar’s heaven.\nThe living and the dead receive grace,\nbathed and refined in the golden spring.\nDemon kings tremble in fear,\nconverging their light upon the Three Fields.\"*\n\nThe Dharma drum is sounded twenty-four times.\nThe incense burner is opened.\n\n**Supreme Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Origin, Three Qi of the Most High Lord Lao, summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officials, Left and Right Attendant Envoys, Incense-Bearing Golden Lads, Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-six each—to emerge. Now summon here the local earth deities and true officials of this domain to swiftly open the passes and present themselves. We now burn incense in proper ritual, dedicating this to so-and-so official, so-and-so person, for state and family, conducting the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat for so many days and nights. May the life-breath of the Most High’s Ten Directions and True Perfected descend and flow into our bodies, that our petitions swiftly ascend before the Jade Thearch of the Supreme Dao of the Utmost Limit, the Most High Lord of the Dao. Each person bows three times.**\n\nAll officials kneel. The Dharma Master sounds the Dharma drum twenty-four times. The officers and soldiers emerge to present the petition.\n\n**We reverently summon forth from within our bodies the true officials and merit officials of our five viscera. From the Supreme Three Heavens, the Enforcers of the Dharma and Agents of Transformation, the Yin-Yang Merit Officials, the Salvific Dao Officers who dispel calamities, and the Lords who disperse misfortune and resolve adversity—twelve each—to emerge. From within our bodies, the governing officials: the Great General of such-and-such jurisdiction, builder of standards and overseer of merits; the Vanguard Merit Officers and Rear Guard Execution Officers; the Post Station Commandant and Post Station Deputy; the Fourfold Merit Overseers and Audience Attendants. From within our bodies, the Transcendent Envoys, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officials, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Deciding Officers, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Officers, the Gale-Wind Courier Post Horses, and the Memorial-Presenting Officials—two each—to emerge. Let all who emerge don their solemn attire, adorned with caps and pendent tassels, arraying their majestic dignity.**\n\nThe Direct Merit Officials wear the Heaven-Piercing Crown and black silk unlined robes. The Orthodox Unity Merit Officials wear the Vermilion Yang Cap and crimson ceremonial robes. The Healing Merit Officials wear the Nine Virtues Crown, multicolored sashes, unlined robes, tiger-tally belts, and hold jade tablets.\n\nThe Direct Merit Officials stand at the four directions. The Orthodox Unity Merit Official stands at the center. The Healing Merit Officials guard and protect our bodies.\n\nThe Left Attendant Envoys bear standards at the fore. The Right Attendant Envoys hold banners at the rear. The Yang Spirit-Deciding Officers stand to the left; the Yin Spirit Officers stand to the right. The Upper Merit Officials stand above; the Middle Merit Officials stand within our bodies. The Qi-Urging Merit Officials hasten the Ten Directions. The Upper Envoys gaze afar toward the heavens. The Middle Envoys survey the eight directions. The Capital Envoys encircle our bodies.\n\nThe Tiger-Strong Attendants, the Sentry Officers, the Capital Commanders, the Heavenly Might Warriors, the Heavenly Couriers, the Armored Soldiers, the Qi-Gathering and Qi-Consuming Officers, the Spirit-Gathering and Spirit-Consuming Officers, the Ghost-Gathering and Ghost-Consuming Officers, the Malevolence-Gathering and Malevolence-Consuming Officers, the Essence-Gathering and Essence-Consuming Officers, the Toxin-Gathering and Toxin-Consuming Officers, the Talisman-Subduing and Shrine-Destroying Officers, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Officers, the Gale-Wind Courier Post Horses, the Memorial-Presenting Officers, the Flying Dragon Riders, and others—all assemble before, behind, to the left, and right of us.\n\nThe Merit Officials and Envoys, having completed their solemn preparations, array their processional regalia. They open the passes and present the petitions to the divine retinue of the Numinous Treasure, the Transcendent Overseers of the Retreat, the Officers of the Heavenly Master’s Twenty-Four Dioceses, the Thirty-Six Sacred Abodes, the Seventy-Two Blessed Lands, the Three Hundred Sixty Famous Mountains, Kunlun and the other celestial palaces, the thirty-six thousand deities, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the Northern Asterism, the officials of the Three Realms of Heaven and Earth, their generals, officers, and soldiers.\n\nThe Dao’s Two Mysteries, Three Origins, Four Beginnings, the Four Directions, the winds and qi, the qi-infusing officers of the celestial stems and earthly branches, the Summoning Lords, the Nine Yi and Hu Elders of the East, the Eight Man and Yue Elders of the South, the Six Rong and Di Elders of the West, the Five Di and Qiang Elders of the North, the Three Qin and Cang Elders of the Center, the Lords of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the marsh and pond deities, the spirits of all temples, the masters of high mountains, forests, valleys, and groves, the Twelve Stream Matriarchs, the root-source and primordial earth deities, the lords of the altars and granaries—all at once don their solemn attire and, with the Merit Officials, Envoys, and Flying Dragon Riders from within our bodies, ascend to present their petitions before the Supreme Dao of the Utmost Limit, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Venerable One, the Supreme Mysterious Elder, the Ten Directions’ Utmost Limit Great Dao, the Hosts of Sagely Virtues, the Heavenly Worthies, the Perfected, the Supreme Thearchs, the Heavenly Thearchs, the Heavenly Master Lords, the Numinous Treasure Retreat-Overseeing Great Dharma Masters, and all the divine officials.\n\n**We, born and raised in the floating world of dust, are mired in its clamor. The three karmic bonds entangle us; the six emotions drift like waves.**\n\nBy gracious encounter with the supreme transformation, we have met true masters. They opened the gates of the Three Clarities’ myriad wonders and expounded the principles of the Eight Radiant Immortals’ longevity. They clarified the sea of desires and dredged the river of love to its depths. We gird ourselves with the Dragon Script and hold fast to the divine registers, propagating the Dao and extolling the Dharma, aiding the state and delivering people. In saving beings and establishing merit, purification and abstinence are the foundation.\n\nNow there is the official so-and-so, who, mindful of the state above and the unseen realms beside, seeks blessings and entreats grace, turning his heart toward the Ten Ultimates. He requests the performance of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Purification Rite. We have heard that the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures, the ranks of numinous immortals, the supreme wondrous Dharma, and the Yellow Register sacred altar communicate with the sagely and summon the perfected, modeling heaven and earth. They safeguard the state and family, so that lord and ministers receive the grace of protection; they deliver the living and the dead, so that all in life and death bear the power of preservation. When the Nine Dragons’ talismanic commands are opened, the hells become tranquil; when the Five Thearchs’ majestic spirits are summoned, the celestial charts shine bright and serene. Their merit surpasses all Dharmas, and their beneficence pervades all beings.\n\nThus, in accordance with the mysterious statutes, we present the ritual tokens: incense, flowers, oil, candles, brocade, and golden dragons, pledging faith to the ten directions and allying our hearts with the three realms. We, upholding the sagely teachings and humbly serving in the mysterious offices, are duty-bound to report all prayers and petitions. Today, we purify our minds and compose our thoughts, bathing in clarity and emptiness. We establish and perform the Yellow Register Grand Purification Rite, offering repentance and gratitude beneath the Three Luminaries for so many days and nights. We surrender our lives to the Utmost Perfected, to deliver so-and-so’s living and deceased kin, freeing them from suffering and ascending to bliss, reconciling grievances and dissolving karmic hindrances, dispelling calamities and dissolving disasters.\n\nWe reverently summon the celestial immortals’ armies of the Three Caverns, the flying immortals’ armies, the terrestrial immortals’ armies, the perfected ones’ armies, the divine beings’ armies, the sun, moon, and stellar constellations’ armies, the Nine Palaces and Five Thearchs’ armies, the Three Rivers and Four Seas’ armies—each numbering nine hundred million myriad riders. We summon the thirty-two overseers of the purification rite, the thirty-two golden lads attending incense, the thirty-two jade maidens scattering flowers, the Five Thearchs’ direct talismans, and the messengers who transmit words and memorials. We summon the thirty-two Flying Dragon Riders and the like. Together, they descend to oversee the purification site, secure the state’s fortune, protect all beings, and deliver the myriad generations of so-and-so’s ancestors. May the suffering souls of the unseen realms sever all evil karmic ties, enter the light, forever escape the three evil destinies, transcend the five sufferings, and surrender their lives to the boundless worlds of the ten directions, to the assemblies of great sages who have attained the Dao, and to the Utmost Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones. We beseech the dissolution of calamities and the removal of disasters, the prolongation of life and the preservation of destiny, passage through the three calamities and eight difficulties amid all evils, the protection of the state and the pacification of the family, and universal benefit to all sentient beings.\n\nOnce the Daoist rites are completed, those who have rendered meritorious service may report to the immortal palaces. The Merit Officials and Flying Dragon Riders shall separately memorialize and transmit these matters in due course. When the list of petitions is concluded, they shall return to our bodies and resume their places in the palaces. When summoned again, they shall arrive as before, in accordance with precedent.\n\nWe strike our teeth three times, swallow our saliva twice, and conclude the *Ritual of the Supreme Ultimate’s Purification Rite*.\n\nEach proclaims his Dharma rank, and all the officials secretly recite their own Dharma ranks:\n\nDisciple of the Three Luminaries of the Supreme Clarity’s Mysterious Capital and Great Cavern, Supreme Master of the Three Caverns, Master Practitioner of the Yellow Register Grand Purification Rite, Master of the Sacred Peak so-and-so, Perfected Lord of the Thearch so-and-so, your subject so-and-so, together in sincerity, reverently memorializes the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, the Utmost Limit Great Dao, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Jade Thearch on High, the assemblies of great sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions, the Utmost Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the thirty-two Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Clarity Supreme Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Watchtower, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity, Supreme Palace, Numinous Treasure, Utmost Perfected, Radiant August Dao Lord, the thirty-six divisions of venerable scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the officials and retinues of the three realms, and all true numina.\n\nWe, having accrued good causes over kalpas, were born into this great transformation. The mysterious and true awakened and delivered us, allowing us to dwell within the mysterious gate. Our three masters pledged and transmitted the Three Treasures’ true scriptures, with the Dharma duty to deliver ninety-nine thousand beings. Though we have ascended to the Utmost Perfected, our merit is slight and our virtue meager, and we have not yet attained immortality. Bearing transgressions and treading errors, we linger in the dusty world. Yet from the moment we received the Dharma, we pledged before the three realms to deliver beings and save creatures, making merit our priority. For all who take refuge, we are duty-bound to report.\n\nNow, in obedience to the edict, how dare we not make this known above?\n\nWe read the words:\n\nAs the petition states, the devotion is truly sincere. The purification master, having inherited blessings from past lives and risen in human rank, serves the state and family, aspiring to exalted fortune. Reflecting on his myriad generations of ancestors and the divine spirits of ten lifetimes—who, in their time in the world, accumulated transgressions and faults, wandering the long night of rebirth without means of deliverance—he desires to repay their boundless grace, which is as vast as the heavens.\n\nWe have heard that the Great Dao of Emptiness and Non-Being nurtures all beings. The Supreme Dharma King and the great sages of the heavens extend their compassionate grace, inaugurating the statutes of the Yellow Register. Repenting before the ten heavens and baring our hearts to the eight directions, our red sincerity turns toward them, and ten thousand sins are absolved. Reverently following the mysterious statutes, we present the golden dragon brocade as the token of our destined life, along with incense, flowers, oil, and candles, to manifest our faith and sincerity. We beseech the deliverance of the living and the dead, praying for mysterious protection.\n\nWe purify our spirits and compose our thoughts, cleansing our minds and darkening our hearts. In accordance with the Yellow Register’s simple texts and the numinous immortals’ statutes, we deliver the living and the deceased, establishing the sacred altar. The four quarters and eight directions model heaven and earth. We establish the purification rite and perform the Dao, burning incense and lighting lamps. We reveal the luminous texts of the Jade Treasury, breaking the suffering of the dark night’s underworld gates. We remove the net of sins and rescue those lost in the ford.\n\nToday, at this dawn of the purification rite, we first offer incense, making offerings to the Utmost Perfected and the supreme Dao Treasure. We surrender our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao. We prostrate ourselves, surrendering our lives to the Three Honored Ones on High. By this merit, we dedicate blessings to the purification master so-and-so’s myriad generations of ancestors and all divine spirits, liberating them from the three evil destinies and transcending the six paths of rebirth.\n\nWe deliver the roots of suffering across the ten directions of the world, guiding beings out of the dark and desolate realms of fire and ash. Our shadows rest in the Jade City, our spirits roam the Purple Palaces. The Jeweled Grove spreads its canopy, and the fragrance of merit and cultivation pervades. May we swiftly enter the wellspring of wisdom and accomplish the immortal Dao.\n\nNow we burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of our Master and the virtues of the Utmost Perfected. After attaining the Dao, we ascend into formlessness, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\nSecond pinch of incense: we offer it to the Utmost Perfected and the supreme Sutra Treasury. We surrender our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao. We prostrate ourselves, surrendering our lives to the Three Honored Ones on High. By this merit, we dedicate blessings to the ancestral lineage of the purification master, the former sages, and the revered spirits of the altars and state. May the phoenix’s reign endure and the dragon’s chart remain eternal. May the emperor’s sacred person receive protection, and the dynastic fortune be prolonged. May transformation embrace Hua and Yi, and merit surpass that of the ancient sage-kings. May the empress’s earthly virtue shine with maternal grace. May the crown prince and princes inherit the celestial mandate, and the dukes, ministers, and officials, both within and beyond the court, adorn the imperial way and expand the great enterprise. May the myriad subjects each preserve their proper place, dwelling in filial piety at home and serving with loyalty to the state. May the nine regions share a common path, and the four seas unite in culture. May the fields yield timely harvests, and no demonic calamities arise. May all under heaven sing in harmony.\n\nMay the disciples of the Dao, dwelling in forests and marshes, proclaim the Dao and praise the Dharma with courage, diligence, and vigor. May they attain the One and the Primal Truth, penetrate the mysterious, and merge with the Dao.\n\nNow we burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of our Master and the virtues of the Utmost Perfected. After attaining the Dao, we ascend into formlessness, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\nThird pinch of incense: we offer it to the Utmost Perfected and the supreme Teacher Treasure. We surrender our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao. We prostrate ourselves, surrendering our lives to the Three Honored Ones on High. By this merit, we dedicate blessings to the purification master’s own kin and relations. May each enjoy peace of spirit and ease of body, their sins extinguished and disasters dispelled. May no sorrows or afflictions assail them, and may their dreams and waking hours be true. May their mortal forms be transformed, their appearances perfected. May their shortened years be extended, and their lives endure. May they diminish selfishness and desire, aligning their conduct with nature. May the noble remain humble, and the wealthy know contentment. May the six relations and nine clans dwell together in harmony and goodness, their hearts united in righteousness, all sharing in blessed fortune.\n\nMay all beings—those that fly and swim, those with consciousness and perception—along with the nine dark realms, the five paths, the six destinies, and the three evil destinies, be freed from suffering and reborn in heaven. May enmities be resolved and grievances released. May they escape the three disasters, the ten thousand calamities, punishments, and misfortunes. May merit flourish and virtuous deeds shine forth.\n\nNow we burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of our Master and the virtues of the Utmost Perfected. After attaining the Dao, we ascend into formlessness, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\nThe ritual of repentance follows the directions—twenty directions in sequence, or the fivefold general repentance, as detailed in the lower scroll. Each visualizes the nine-colored circular radiance, swallows saliva, and recites the secret demon-quelling incantation.\n\nThe Dharma Master stands at the Ghost Gate, the Precentor at the Heavenly Gate. The Dharma Master visualizes the sun and moon and the nine-colored circular light behind his neck, illuminating all within and without, as in the *Visualization of the Spirits* diagram. Upon completing the mudra, he strikes his teeth three times and recites the secret incantation:\n\n*\"The Yellow Center commands qi to sever demonic lineages,\nScrutinizing and subduing strong spirits, cutting off the old fiend.\nThe Supreme has decreed from the Supreme Chamber—\nHasten! Summon the Northern Emperor to the Jade Palace.\nReceive the mighty command to proclaim to the Demon Kings,\nThe Five Emperors flourish with life’s vital force.\nThe secret jade texts are now fully revealed—\nThe Three Heavens revolve in brightness, the Six Heavens reach their end.\nHow wise! How wise!\"*\n\nThis incantation must be recited in secret, inaudible even to oneself. To violate this is to incur fault. Be cautious! Be cautious!\n\nCircling in the *Step of Emptiness*,\nTreading the cloud-net in spiraling motion, riding the void to walk the dark warp.\nChanting and intoning the honored *Emperor Unity*,\nA hundred passages naturally harmonize.\nBowing to command the lads of the Eight Seas,\nLooking up to escort the lofty immortals.\nThe heavens scatter incense and blossoms,\nA numinous wind arises, serene.\nLong-held vows settle the root of destiny,\nThus attaining lofty eminence.\nRejoicing before the *Most High*,\nEven ten thousand kalpas are but a beginning.\n\nAgain—\nThe towering *Dark Capital Mountain*,\nWhere the ten directions revere the *August Unity*.\nThe soaring *Celestial Treasure Terrace*,\nRadiance and flame flowing like the sun.\nResplendent jade groves in brilliance,\nVermilion fruits gleaming in splendor.\nEver mindful to consume primordial essence,\nRefining fluids to solidify form and substance.\nGolden light scatters through the *Purple Tenuity*,\nProfound and serene, the *Great Vehicle* in ease.\n\nAgain—\nLooking up to visualize the *Most High*,\nFlowering light flourishing in the cinnabar field.\nGazing left to lift the *Gloom-Dispeller*,\nGazing right to escort the *Essence-Binder*.\nThe *Six Perfections* observe the *Brahma-conduct*,\nVirtue and power renew with the sun.\nLong-accumulated merit responds to past causes,\nHearing the scriptures as if meeting kin.\nHeaven-endowed with transcendent talent,\nDelighting in reciting the subtle texts.\nThe *Primordial Harmony* of emptiness and peace,\nExhaling and inhaling the flowing rosy mist.\n*Womb-breathing* stills the hundred passages,\nIn profound solitude, mastering the three expedients.\nThe *Mud-Pill Palace* becomes a luminous mirror,\nThus attaining the *Golden Flower Immortal*.\nThe *Demon Kings* respectfully receive the task,\nThus able to ascend and attend the heavens.\nAll begins with purification and abstinence,\nAccumulating merit to bind past affinities.\nSoaring flight through the Great Void,\nEscorting the loftiest adepts.\n\n*Three Invocations*—\nTaking the Dharma as wife,\nCherishing the scriptures like pearls and jade.\nHolding precepts to restrain the six senses,\nMindful of the Dao to dispel desires.\nIn purity, the upright qi abides,\nSerene, the spirit in silent stillness.\nHeavenly demons all revere and protect,\nLifetimes enjoying great fortune.\n\n*Three Bows*—\nWe, with devoted hearts, prostrate and bow to the *Most High Boundless Dao*.\nWe, with devoted hearts, prostrate and bow to the thirty-six revered scriptures.\nWe, with devoted hearts, prostrate and bow to the *Great Dharma Master of the Dark Mystery*.\n\n*Reiterating the Dharma Rank*—\nWe, [your] humble servants, [names] in unison and sincerity, humbly address and invoke the *Most High Boundless Dao*, the *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning*; the *Most High Lord of the Dao*; the *Most High Lord Lao*; the *Boundless Dao* of the ten directions and the *Virtuous Host of Sages*; the *Celestial Worthies* and *Perfected*; the *Supreme Emperors* and *Celestial Emperors*; the thirty-six revered scriptures; the *Great Dharma Master of the Dark Mystery*; the *High Ministers* and *Prime Ministers*; the *Four Offices* and *Five Emperors*; the officials and retinues of the Three Realms; and all true numina.\n\nWe, molded by the Two Modes, planted causes over myriad kalpas.\nPresumptuously receiving the transformative influence of the Dao, yet still unenlightened to the *Ultimate Perfection*.\n\nYet we, though devoted to revering the mysterious scriptures and venerating the hidden mysteries, have failed to extend our merit to the moving and the growing, while our transgressions have already amassed like hills and forests. Ever fearful that our allotted span may end, we shall face judgment in the dark night. Yet on this day of covenant, we hold salvation as foremost, proclaiming the Dao to deliver beings and assisting the state in its transformative work. We humbly offer our meager service, that it may accord with the boundless compassion of the Primordial.\n\nNow the patron of this retreat, submitting to the *Perfected of the Highest*, devoutly reveres the *Great Dao*. Above, they pray for the enduring fortune of the state; below, they extend their care to both the living and the departed. They seek to repay the nurturing grace of sovereign and kin, and to contemplate the sufferings of those trapped in the cycles of the dark night. Bearing their vows and pledges, they have established this sacred precinct, to atone for past faults and to invoke blessings for the future. With earnest and sincere supplication, how dare we not make this known above?\n\nThus, we lead and exhort our fellow practitioners, adhering strictly to the ritual codes. We arrange the altar, array the scriptures, and model the sacred space upon heaven. Pouring forth our sincerity to the *Supreme Mystery*, we still our minds before the *Most Holy*. We prostrate ourselves, hoping that the *Great Dao of Emptiness and Non-Being*, the *Lofty and Boundless Honored One*, will look upon our earnest devotion with compassion and bestow the profound blessings of the *Mysterious*. May the *Four Offices and Five Emperors*, the *Mighty Spirits of the Three Realms*, descend with their transformative power, dispelling the mists and clouds to bring blessings; may they manifest their luminous might, attending our prayers and repentance in unison.\n\nMay the gates of the netherworld’s long night be opened, and the sufferings of the imprisoned souls in the dark prisons be released. May they depart the shadowy realms, ascend the celestial thoroughfares, awaken to the Dharma, hear the scriptures, and through contemplation of the *Mysterious*, realize the Dao.\n\nMay the patron’s household—nine generations of kin, both departed and living—see their three karmic offenses dissolved and their six sensory obstructions extinguished. May the celestial nets and earthly snares not bring calamity to their three destinies; may the dark stars and bright constellations forever still the misfortunes of the five phases. May the divine and true protect them, increasing their fortune and longevity.\n\nAbove, may the state’s prosperity know no bounds, and the imperial reign endure forever. May the sacred person of the sovereign enjoy boundless longevity, towering like the mountains; may their sagely grace flow abundantly, vast as the deep seas. May all regions submit in harmony, and the eight directions shine with clarity. May the three luminaries follow their courses in the primordial heavens, and the hundred grains flourish throughout the land. May borders know no war, and customs resound with songs of praise. May the world attain great peace, and all beings fulfill their natures. May this extend to all, whether hidden or manifest, sinking or submerged, that together they may ascend the steps of the true and reach the shore of blessings.\n\nMay the *Heavenly Worthy’s* choice to broadly deliver accord with our humble submission, and may our sincerity in devotion be met below. We respectfully make this known.\n\nWe now invoke:\nFirst, the harmonious union of heaven and earth;\nSecond, the steadfast brightness of sun and moon;\nThird, the orderly succession of yin and yang;\nFourth, the peace of the realm;\nFifth, the flourishing fortune of the emperor;\nSixth, the loyalty and integrity of ministers;\nSeventh, the well-being of the myriad people;\nEighth, the abundance of the hundred grains;\nNinth, the liberation of the suffering in the dark paths;\nTenth, the flourishing of the Great Dao.\n\nWe replenish the incense burner.\nO *Incense Official Messengers*, *Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger*, and all *Spirit Officials* attendant upon the incense, may this place where we perform the Dao naturally generate golden elixir, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred spirits and host of Perfected gather here before the incense burner. O jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions, attend the fragrant smoke and convey our supplications, transmitting them directly to the presence of the *Most True and Boundless Dao*, the *Jade Emperor* upon his throne.\n\nWe bow three times.\n*Exiting the Hall Chant*\n\nTo repay the kindness and virtue of past lives,\nthe Dao-heart arises transcendent.\nThe body ascends to the Immortal Capital,\nand the seven ancestors all attain liberation.\n\n*Exiting the Chamber*\nThe Dharma Master recites the spell at the Earth Gate, strikes the teeth thrice, and intones:\n\"Emerging from yin into yang,\nthe myriad spirits open wide.\"\nWhen the gates’ affairs are complete,\npray close the Imperial Chamber.\nThe Jade Maidens in attendance\nillumine and prepare the divine

Five Emperors and the Direct Day—let them emerge.\nNow summon the local Earth Gods and Territorial True Officials to swiftly open the gates.\nWe now burn incense and offer it on behalf of so-and-so

ascend into formlessness, uniting with the Dao in truth.\n\nThis pure dawn, proceeding in the Dao’s rites, we move the second pinch of incense upward,\nSurrendering body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao.\nWe, your servants, bow our heads to the earth, surrendering our lives to the Most High Venerable Scriptures.\nMay this merit extend to bless our family’s ninefold ancestors and sevenfold

courts of night;\nWitnessed by the Five Emperors, directly entering the cool and clear realm.\nThus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the Perfected’s virtue,\nWho, after attaining the Dao, ascend into formlessness, uniting with the Dao in truth.\n\nThis pure dawn, proceeding in the Dao’s rites, we move the third pinch of incense upward,\nSurrendering body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao.\nWe, your servants, bow our heads to the earth, surrendering our lives to the Most High Three Honored Ones.\nMay this merit flow to our family’s sixfold affines and ninefold kin.\nMay their fortune-tree flourish eternally, their virtue-star shine forever.\nMay the divine lords deign to look down, dissolving kalpas of karmic transgressions;\nMay the sagely power aid from all sides, untying boundless calamities.\nMay the numinous elixir secretly protect, the profound Dao silently accord.\nExtending to all beings, reaching the six destinies—\nMay the dark springs depart from suffering, the long night open to light.\nMay the wriggling and flying, the sinking and soaring, universally partake in vast fortune.\nThus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the Perfected’s virtue,\nWho, after attaining the Dao, ascend into formlessness, uniting with the Dao in truth.\n\nRitual Directions\nRepentance\n\n**Pacing the Void**\n\nBowing low and raising high, we hold the Most High in mind,\nRadiant splendor blooms within the cinnabar field.\nTo the left, we lift the dark and guarded,\nTo the right, we grasp the bound and luminous.\nThe Six Perfections crown the Brahman conduct,\nVirtue and the Dao follow where the sun abides.\nAccumulated blessings from past lives respond,\nHearing the scriptures as if meeting kin most dear.\nHeaven-endowed with talent surpassing the world,\nJoyfully reciting the subtle and profound chapters.\nIn emptiness and great harmony, qi flows,\nExhaling and inhaling the essence of streaming clouds.\nFetal breathing stills the hundred passages,\nIn solitude, we fathom the Three Chapters.\nMud and the Nine Caverns reveal bright visions,\nThus attaining the Golden Flower Immortal.\nThe Demon Kings respectfully receive their charge,\nAnd so ascend to the heavens above.\nAll begins with fasting and precepts,\nPiling merit to bind past-life affinities.\nSoaring through the Great Void,\nLifting and guiding the loftiest ones.\n\n**Threefold Invocation**\n**Threefold Prostration**\nWe, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao.\nWe, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.\n\n**Reverently Reciting the Dharma Titles**\nDisciples of the Mysterious Capital of the Upper Clarity, we, your humble servants, reverently and earnestly proclaim before the Most High, Boundless Great Dao—the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Commencement, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, and all true numina of the ten directions, three realms, famous mountains, and grotto-heavens.\n\nWe have heard that the Great Dao precedes heaven,\nUtterly real, vast and distant.\nIt is the origin of creation, the potter of yin and yang.\nWhen it condenses spirit, it is profound stillness and emptiness;\nWhen it applies its function, it encompasses the vast and great.\nThe Three Officials and Five Emperors, the Nine Bureaus and Four Offices,\nUphold the mysterious transformation to give life and completion,\nReceiving the divine statutes to examine and tally.\nFortune and misfortune, sin and blessing—\nNot even the tiniest is overlooked.\n\nThe patron of this retreat, so-and-so,\nFrom the first condensation of qi in the primordial heavens,\nHas accumulated karmic causes through kalpas immeasurable.\nBearing the movement of nature’s course,\nReceiving the workings of creation’s power,\nWe reflect with reverence upon the nine generations and seven lineages,\nThe myriad ancestors and ten thousand progenitors.\nTheir forms have long been molded,\nTheir accumulated transgressions run deep.\nExtending to this very body, kin, and affines,\nFrom time without beginning to this very day,\nThe transgressions and faults bound are\nBoundless and immeasurable.\nThe living and the dead bear their offenses,\nIn life and death, they err and stray.\nThe bitter roots of past-life adversaries\nHave yet to be dissolved and swept away.\n\nNow, in accordance with the *Scripture on Karmic Retribution and Liberation Spoken by the Flying Heavenly Divine Persons* and the *Text on Salvation and Deliverance*,\nWe prepare golden dragon-patterned silks, incense, flowers, and ritual offerings,\nPurify our minds and refine our conduct,\nEstablishing this sacred precinct.\nWe repent before the Mysterious Perfected,\nRedeeming and ransoming our sins and faults.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Heavenly Worthy, in compassion, will protect and aid,\nThat the Great Sages will deign to shine their light.\nCommanding the Earthly Offices,\nThey will open the path to deliver the souls and spirits,\nLeading them out from the abode of the long night,\nFreeing them from the midst of the Nine Dark Springs.\nAdorned in the celestial regalia,\nTheir names erased from the ghostly registers,\nThey will ascend beyond the nether realms,\nBathe in the numinous streams,\nAnd attain the carefree realms of the heavenly halls.\nTheir baleful destinies severed,\nFortune and benefit will manifest.\nThe patron’s family, both inner and outer kin,\nWill together partake in this radiant protection.\nDisasters and misfortunes will cease,\nAuspicious omens will ever arrive.\nThe Great Dao will descend with its numinous power,\nThe heavens will bestow their aid.\nNo demonic forces will arise,\nNo evils will assail.\nThe nation’s destiny will extend and flourish,\nThe imperial enterprise will broaden and expand.\nThe sagely body will receive blessings,\nThe four seas will rest in peace.\nThe celestial vault will shine clear,\nThe divine winds will be still and silent.\nWeapons will be laid down,\nAll people will delight in well-being.\nThe harvests will be bountiful,\nThe realm will know no strife.\nThe flying and sinking will follow their nature,\nThe dark night will be illuminated.\nExtending to the ten directions,\nPervading the three realms,\nAll under heaven will be wholly saved,\nAll will receive grace.\n\nMay the blessings of the Heavenly Worthy and Great Sages above be made manifest,\nAnd may the sincerity of our refuge below be answered.\nWe reverently proclaim this to be heard.\n\n**Generating the Aspirations**\nFirst aspiration: For the sake of the Dao’s Four Great Elements, in harmony with the virtue of the retreat’s patron.\nMay the seven generations of parents be spared from falling into sorrow and suffering,\nAscend to the heavenly halls,\nAnd receive clothing and food naturally.\n\nSecond aspiration: For the emperor and lord of the nation, may the Dao’s transformation flourish and prosper.\nMay the schools and academies thrive,\nThe imperial teachings expand and

golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs naturally arise. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones gather here, before the incense burner and the fragrant flame. May I, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the fragrant smoke, transmitting and presenting my supplications, swiftly reaching the presence of the Most High, the Limitless, the Great Dao, the Three Clarities, the Supreme Saints, and the Jade Emperor.\n\n*Exiting the Chamber*\n*End of the Fourth Scroll of the* **Highest Clarity Yellow Register Retreat Rites**\n*Fifth Scroll of the* **Highest Clarity Yellow Register Retreat Rites**\n*Compiled by Master Du Guangting of Tang Guangcheng*\n\n**Second Day: Midday Procession of the Dao**\n*Entering the Chamber*\nEach pays homage to the master, visualizing as prescribed.\n\nThe Yellow Center guards with qi, severing the roots of demonic clans.\nSuppressing the sources of evil,\nCutting off the traces of demons.\nBy the talismanic command of the Most High,\nDivine power is summoned and controlled.\nThe myriad spirits are thus subdued,\nRepelling misfortune and eliminating calamity.\nThe three wheels of royal qi,\nCirculate the true wind.\nThe purple portal cradles jade,\nBestowing boundless deliverance.\nTo the left, the Azure Waist is commanded;\nTo the right, the Mushroom Youth is summoned.\nRiding the whirlwind and soaring light,\nMastering the nine voids.\nThe Mysterious Altar responds to the moment,\nMounting the qi in emptiness.\nThe ten thousand perfected descend in unison,\nDelivering boundless salvation.\n\n*Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times*\n\nO Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin of the Three Qi, Most High Lord Lao: summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Left and Right Fragrant Bearers, the Dragon-Riding Couriers, the Golden Youths attending incense, the Jade Maidens transmitting words, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, the Direct-Day Fragrant Officials—thirty-six each. Summon forth the local earth gods and territorial deities, the true officials and orthodox spirits, to swiftly emerge, prepare their attire, and open the gates. As we now burn incense, we dedicate it to so-and-so official, so-and-so person, for the state and for the family, in the performance of the Most High Yellow Register Great Retreat for so many days and nights. Today, on the second day at midday, we ascend the altar, pay homage to the perfected, and practice the Dao. May we receive the life-generating qi of the Most High and the ten directions’ true perfected ones, flowing into our bodies, so that our supplications swiftly reach the presence of the Most High, the Limitless, the Great Dao, the Jade Emperor.\n\nEach declares their dharma rank:\n\nWe, disciples of the Mysterious Capital, humbly and with one heart, reverently supplicate the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Non-Being and Spontaneous Origin, the Limitless Great Dao, the Most High Great Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Jade Emperor, the ten directions’ great saintly perfected ones who have attained the Dao, the myriad true lords and venerable masters, the thirty-six Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Void Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, the Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Watchtower, Seven-Jewel Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity Supreme Palace, the Numinous Treasure Perfected Sovereign of Luminous Augustness, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the King of Total Perfection of the Western Culmination, the Eastern Minister of Destiny, the Supreme Primordial Perfected One, the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace Lower Teaching, the numinous palaces of the Five Marchmounts, the perfected immortals of the renowned mountains and grotto-heavens, the responsive and perceptive spirits of the Three Realms, and all true numina.\n\nWe, by fortunate coincidence, meet this blessed occasion, our good karma accumulated from past encounters. The Three Honored Ones spread the transformation of non-action; the Four Luminaries open the gate of broad salvation. Thus, with mortal forms, we rely on the wondrous dharma of our lineage. We unfold the precious writs of the ninefold radiance, gaze upon the jade chapters of the Three Caverns. Though inwardly we measure our meager capacities, surely we are unworthy. Only through the fast and precepts do we hope to establish modest merit, aiding the state and delivering people, fulfilling the mysterious intent. In all our endeavors, how dare we not report them above?\n\n*Reading the Petition*\nFollowing the words of the petition, we sincerely submit to the Mysterious Culmination. For the state and for the family, we request blessings and pray for grace.\n\nDisciple so-and-so reflects: my nature is endowed with the three numina, my spirit molded by the four greats. In the River of Love, my nature is drowned; in the Sea of Desire, my sincerity races. Illusory realms are easily confused; the mountain of blessings is hard to construct. Faults and transgressions accumulate, deepening with the years. I have heard that the wondrous retreat of the Yellow Register is a secret rite of the Mysterious Capital. Above, it delivers billions of ancestors, severing the roots of evil karma and sinful retribution; below, it rescues the nine nights and three paths, the destitute souls and hidden spirits. It dissolves calamitous knots, opens deliverance for heaven and humanity. Wherever its blessings extend, families and states enjoy eternal peace. Thus, with solemn reverence and earnest sincerity, I prepare fragrant flowers, offerings, patterned silks, golden dragons, lamps, and candles, establishing the retreat and practicing the Dao, praying for the descent of the perfected. Universally for the living and the dead, I turn my heart and plead for destiny.\n\nToday, at midday, practicing the Dao, we, the assembled dharma practitioners, offer this first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering to the Most High and True Dao Treasure. We dedicate our bodies, lives, and destinies, prostrating ourselves, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Most High. May this merit, above, benefit the sacred spirits of the altars of soil and grain and the ancestral temples. May they merge with the three realms, ascend the nine heavens, secretly assist the great foundation, and safeguard the great enterprise. May the emperor’s longevity equal the sun and moon, his transformation harmonize the three origins. May his chariots and standards reach the eight extremities, his dominion embrace the ten thousand states. May the heir apparent, the regional lords, and the imperial aides assist the imperial plan. May the worthy ministers and meritorious officials protect and govern the royal house. May auspicious clouds spread their radiance, and the dharma rain nourish all. May the four companions and three masters, the mountain-dwelling fellow practitioners, together attain the fruit of perfection, all ascend the immortal ranks.\n\nThus, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great saintly host of the perfected and true. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, in harmony and union with the Dao in truth.\n\nToday, at midday, practicing the Dao, we offer this second pinch of incense. We dedicate our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao, prostrating ourselves, taking refuge in the Most High Revered Scriptures. May this merit bless the nine generations of ancestors in the hidden chambers and the seven lineages of spiritual consciousness. May the vast radiance shine downward, leading them from the dark springs’ gates; may the mysterious grace spread widely, releasing them from the net of scorching toil. May the Three Officials erase their records, and the Five Paths generate their spirits. May they hear the true dharma in the Purple Tenuity, pay homage to the perfected in the Azure Vault. May they wear the talismans of the numinous writs, transcend the cold courts of the night prisons. May the six destinies and three paths together reach the realm of blessings.\n\nThus, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great saintly host of the perfected and true. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless.\n\nWith the Dao uniting in perfected truth,\nwe now perform the midway rite of pacing the Dao.\nBurning this third pinch of incense,\nwe offer body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao,\nprostrating ourselves in reverence to the Three Supreme Ones of the Most High.\n\nMay this merit flow to the nine affinities and six clans of such-and-such a household,\nto all inner and outer kin.\nMay their forms harmonize with primordial harmony,\ntheir spirits merge with the wondrous Dao.\nGold steadfast and jade lustrous,\nmay their blessings increase and their radiance grow;\nmirrors bright and dust cleared,\nmay their lifespans extend and stretch afar.\nDisasters disperse like vanishing mist,\ngoodness arrives like gathering clouds.\nFrom the moving and still to the flying and sinking,\nwithin the realm and beyond its bounds,\nmay all alike receive vast fortune,\nall bathe in the mysterious workings.\n\nThus we now burn incense,\ntaking refuge in the great saintly host of the perfected and true.\nAfter attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless,\nwith the Dao uniting in perfected truth.\n\nThe rites proceed:\nRepentance,\nPacing the Void,\nReining the reins to traverse the ten directions,\nresting in turn upon the slopes of the darkly luminous.\nGazing upward at the Terrace of Kalpas,\nlooking downward at the Purple Cloud Net.\nWandering freely in the Capital of the Most High,\ntogether we sit upon lotus blossoms.\nThrough accumulated study, one becomes a perfected person,\nserene in harmony of nourishing qi.\nForever enjoying boundless life,\nwhy count even ten thousand cedars as many?\n\nThreefold invocation,\nThreefold prostration.\n\nWe, with utmost sincerity, bow our heads in reverence to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.\nWe, with utmost sincerity, bow our heads in reverence to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, with utmost sincerity, bow our heads in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.\n\nOnce more proclaiming our rank:\nDisciples of the Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital, we humbly and with one heart address the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin; the Supreme Great Dao Lord; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Boundless Great Dao and the Host of Virtuous Saints and Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions; the Heavenly Emperors and Celestial Thearchs; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the High Ministers and Prime Ministers, the Four Offices and Five Emperors; the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace Lower Teaching; the King of Total Perfection of the Western Ultimate; the Divine Officials of the Five Marchmounts, the Grotto-Heavens of the Famous Mountains, and all responsive and perceptive perfected numina of the Three Realms.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves, having heard that the Primordial August One established the teaching, and the Supreme Dao transmitted its texts. The Azure Scriptures spread afar, rescuing the four deluded from the six destinies; the Vermilion Writings broadly expounded, bestowing abundant blessings upon the Nine Dark Realms. The living and the dead alike receive grace, the benighted and the enlightened together know peace.\n\nWe, above, consider the nine mystic generations and seven ancestral lines, the karmic bonds of kalpas past, extending to lord and kin, and reaching to family and state. Reflecting upon the radiant favor, we grandly open the vast interior. We take refuge at the Mysterious Altar, offering sincerity to the Purple Palace. We request to perform the fast and vigil, to convey our earnest prayers.\n\nFollowing the ranked texts and observing the precepts and forms, we array the positions of the stars, emulating the round vault above; we open the altar’s gates of sun and moon, aligning with the true pattern at the sides. Incense, flowers, lamps, and candles attest to our faith and convey our sincerity. Dragon jades and patterned silks express the heart and display our rites. With concentrated thought and focused visualization, we hope to attain resonance and communion.\n\nWe pray that the Supreme Dharma King will shine forth his compassionate light to illumine below; that the Great Sage of the Mysterious Capital will extend his beneficent influence to descend afar. May he command the flying heavenly spirit-kings to proclaim the covenant to the Three Realms; may he open the palaces of the Cold Court to release the hidden souls. May the numinous essences of generations past all receive deliverance and elevation. Bathed in the divine fluid, may they ascend beyond the Southern Palace. Hearing the Dharma-sound, may they transform and be born in the immortal realms.\n\nAbove, we pray for the eternal life of the sagely lord, for the imperial enterprise to know no bounds. May the waves of the Eight Seas all become imperial grace; may the mountains and rivers of the Nine Enclosures all become royal domains. May the tracks of chariots be wholly unified, the celestial motions all harmonious. May the Eight Winds blow gently, the Five Grains ripen abundantly. May weapons of war not be raised, beacon fires forever stilled. May the people know no disease, and customs abound in auspicious signs. May our family, kin, and clan all partake of vast fortune. May the Three Paths and Nine Nights, the moving and the still, the floating and the hidden, all receive the compassion of the wondrous Dao, and together attain the fruits of spontaneity.\n\nAbove, may the Heavenly Worthies manifest their great compassion; below, may our sincere prayers be answered. We humbly present this petition for your hearing.\n\nWe make our vows:\n\nFirst vow: May the Great Dao be serene and empty, tranquil and still, abiding in clarity.

May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones gather here, where incense and flame illuminate the altar’s censer.\n\nMay the disciple of the fast, so-and-so, whether living or deceased, receive blessings; may the hidden and manifest be graced with favor. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the fragrant smoke, conveying all that your servant has just petitioned directly to the August Jade Emperor of the Utmost Real and Boundless Dao.\n\nExiting the chamber.\n*Taishang Huanglu Fast Ritual*, Scroll Five concludes.\n\n*Taishang Huanglu Fast Ritual*, Scroll Six\nCompiled by Master Du Guangting of Tang Guangcheng\n\n**Second Day: Twilight Procession of the Dao**\n\nEntering the chamber.\nEach pays respects to the master, visualizing as prescribed.\n\n**Guarding the Spirits**\nThe perfected of the Golden Void descend; divine tigers patrol the encampment.\nThe Jade Emperor dons auroral radiance; the deities of all heavens command the numinous.\nThe Nine Dawns turn their chariots; the myriad demons bind their forms.\nNinefold subtle flames burst forth; divine might seizes essences.\nMolten gold hurls fire; all evils dissolve together.\nDivine splendor illumines the night; profound mystery endures eternal spring.\nThe sagely Dao flows boundless; the ten directions stand solemn and clear.\nPreserving and governing the kalpa’s fate, primordial harmony prevails—*yuan heng li zhen*.\n\nThe Twenty-Four Rolls of the Dharma Drum Resound\n\nFrom the Supreme Three Heavens, the Primordial Origin of the Three Qi, the Most High Lord Lao, summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attending Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon-Riding Scribes, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Thirty-Six Officers of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense—each in their thirty-sixfold ranks. Summon now the local earth deities and domain guardians, the true officials and correct spirits, to swiftly emerge and open the passes.\n\nWe now burn incense in proper ritual, dedicating this to so-and-so official, so-and-so person, for state and family, as we undertake the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast for so many days and nights. On this second day, at twilight, we ascend the altar, burn incense, and perform the Dao-procession. May the life-generating qi of the Most High’s Ten Directions and Correct Perfected Ones descend and flow into our bodies, that our supplications swiftly reach the presence of the Jade Thearch, the August Emperor of the Supreme Dao of the Utmost Real and Infinite.\n\nEach proclaims their dharma-rank:\n\nDisciples of the Supreme Clarity and Mystic Capital, we, so-and-so, humbly and with one mind, reverently address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous Origin, the Infinite Dao, the Most High Great Dao Lord, the Great Sagely Ancestor, the Highest Great Dao, the Golden Watchtower, the Mysterious Origin, the Heavenly Thearch of the August Emperor, the Most High Lord Lao, the Supreme Mysterious Elder, the Great Sages of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Void Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, the Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous, the Northern Perfected, the Mystic Capital, the Golden Watchtower, the Seven-Treasure Mystic Terrace, the Purple Tenuity, the Supreme Palace, the Numinous Treasure, the Perfected and Radiant August Dao Lord, the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Center, the Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, the Director of Destinies Perfected Lord, the King of Total Perfection of the Western Culmen, the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lower Teaching, the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Departments, the True Officials of the Five Marchmounts, the Grottoes and Caverns of the Numinous Mountains, the responsive and perceptive deities of the Three Realms, and all the mysterious bureaus.\n\nWe have long been endowed with the true vehicle and born in an age of Dao-transformations. The Vermilion Writs govern fate; the Mysterious Teaching spreads widely. We have presumptuously received the grace of masters and transmitted the secret registers. Yet we have not been able to lodge our spirits in the famous peaks, fix our thoughts on the Central Void, or befriend the Supreme Perfected. Thus, while we vow to deliver the departed according to the mysterious statutes, our first duty is to aid the state, expound the Dharma to save people, and establish merit as our foundation. In all our petitions, how dare we not make this known above?\n\nRecitation of the Words\n\nFollowing the recited words, we truly and earnestly pray. May this benefit the state and family, universally extending to the living and the dead. We reverently invoke the imperial altar, looking up to implore the mysterious blessings.\n\nWe, in accordance with the Purple Yang Jade Writs and the Yellow Register’s precious texts, the karmic conditions of sin and fortune, and the deliverance statutes, present silk as ritual sincerity, dragon jades, incense, and flowers, offering our sincere hearts as we perform the fast and vigil. We prostrate ourselves, hoping the Great Sages of the Ten Directions and the Most High’s host of venerables will condescend to descend their majestic radiance and graciously turn their wise gaze. May they broadly bestow blessings and favor, fulfilling our heartfelt sincerity.\n\nOn this twilight procession of the Dao, we request the Dharma assembly to offer the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to rely on the Three Venerables of the Most High. May these merits be dedicated to the ancestral temples and the august spirits of the altars of soil and grain, ascending to the Great Clarity, roaming the Purple Watchtower. May the emperor’s august brilliance, together with the encompassing of heaven and earth, equally honor transformations, pervade the boundless, and extend benevolence to all without exception. May the empress, inner officials, and the six palaces be suffused with goodness. May the crown prince and the various princes have blessings extending for ten thousand generations. May the myriad officials, ministers, the Four Companions, and the Three Masters all enter non-action and fully attain the fruits of the Real.\n\nThus we burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely host of masters and the virtues of the Perfected. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nOn this twilight procession of the Dao, we request the Dharma assembly to offer the second pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.\n\nWe devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to rely on the Most High’s Venerable Scriptures. May these merits bring blessings to such-and-such a family, the ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears, the departed spirits. May the transgressions of kalpas be washed away, receiving the registers of the Three Caverns; may the karmic retributions of accumulated lives be dissolved, escaping the ninefold darknesses of suffering. May their essences be refined in the Southern Palace, their spirits ascend to the upper realms.\n\nThus we burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely host of masters and the virtues of the Perfected. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nOn this twilight procession of the Dao, we request the Dharma assembly to offer the third pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters.\n\nWe devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to rely on the Three Venerables of the Most High.

the Three and Five in majesty;\nThat the sagely sovereign of the Golden Portal transmit boundless blessings through myriad generations.\nMay the flames of border beacons be extinguished,\nAnd distant frontiers return to benevolence.\nMay the hundred grains flourish in abundance,\nAnd the Three Luminaries shine brightly.\nMay propitious clouds and auspicious dew envelop heaven and earth in omens;\nMay steeds of blessing and chariots of jade emerge from mountains and rivers in celebration.\n\nExtending to all beings and creatures,\nThe nether gates and dark passes,\nAll forms of life, whether moving or still,\nAnd all destinies, whether flying or sinking,\nFrom the Nine Abysses below to the myriad heavens above,\nMay all equally receive the vast compassion and together ascend to ultimate bliss.\n\nAbove, the boundless grace of the Heavenly Worthy is made manifest;\nBelow, it accords with the sincere devotion of your servants.\nWe reverently present this

Nights all attain liberation.\nFourth, may the orphaned and unattached spirits all receive rebirth.\nFifth, may the world know great peace, and the five grains ripen in abundance.\nSixth, may ministers be loyal and children filial, rulers benevolent and fathers kind.\nSeventh, may the four seas be united, and enmity and kinship be reconciled.\nEighth, may those in hidden wombs and eggs all be born and grow.\nNinth, may chronic and recent illnesses swiftly be healed.\nTenth, may the destitute and exposed be clothed and fed.\n\n**Replenishing the Censer**\n\nIncense Officials and Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Attending Incense Spirits,\nAt this place where your servants practice the Dao and ascend the altar,\nMay golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms

favor.\nMay the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions,\nGuard the incense smoke and transmit the petitions just presented,\nDirectly to the presence of the Most True, Boundless Great

Let the local earth deities and territorial true officials swiftly emerge to open the passes.\n\nWe now, in this very moment, burn incense and perform the Dao-procession, dedicating it to such-and-such an official or such-and-such a person, for the state and for the household, in the offering of the Most High Yellow Register Grand Fast for so many days and nights. On this third day’s midday ascent to the altar to pay homage to the Perfected and perform the Dao-procession, may we receive the life-generating qi of the Most High’s Ten Directions’ true and correct Perfected, descending into our bodies, that our prayers swiftly ascend and directly reach the presence of the Jade Thearch of the Supreme Dao, the Limitless Great Dao.\n\nEach declares their dharma-rank:\n\nDisciples of the Mysterious Capital of Supreme Purity, we, so-and-so and others, reverently and with unified sincerity, address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous, the Limitless Great Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Highest August Thearch of the Golden Watchtower, the Mysterious Primordial Heavenly Sovereign, the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, the Highest Jade Thearch, the great holy and perfected hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the thirty-six Heavenly Lords, the Jade Void Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Florescence and Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous and Northern Perfected, the Mysterious Capital and Jade Metropolis, the Golden Watchtower and Seven-Jewel Mysterious Terrace, the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Numinous Treasure’s Perfected Radiant August Lord of the Dao, the thirty-six divisions of the venerable scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the True Lord of Life and Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, the King of Total Perfection of the Western Ultimate, the twenty-four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lesser Teaching, the numinous palaces of the Five Marchmounts, the grotto-heavens of the famous mountains, and the perfected transcendents of the Three Realms who respond to invocations.\n\nWe prostrate and have heard: the Supreme Dao is profoundly empty, its mysterious workings congeal in stillness. It embraces the ten thousand images, nurtures the hundred spirits. Its grace extends to the living and the dead, its benevolence embraces household and state. By the kindness of masters and companions, we have received transmission of the utmost Perfected. We ought to assist the state in establishing merit, delivering people and rescuing beings. In all our prayers and supplications, how dare we not make this known above?\n\n**Reading the Petition**\nIn accordance with the petition’s intent, we earnestly cultivate reverence. We repay the nurturing kindness of heaven and earth, reciprocate the beneficent gifts of the state. Above, we dedicate this to the nine generations; broadly, we extend it to all beings. We offer jade disks to express our sincerity, prepare incense and flowers to demonstrate our faith. Our minds are solely devoted and pure, hoping to attain resonance and communion.\n\nWe reverently follow the Yellow Register’s scriptural texts and the numinous transcendents’ ritual codes.

May the princes and crown princes be blessed with extended years. May the marquises, earls, dukes, ministers, and worthy assistants assist in perfecting the sagely transformation, aiding and supporting the imperial enterprise.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Host of Master Venerables, whose virtue is most perfect. After attaining the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the True.\n\nAt this midpoint of the ritual, we invite the assembly of the Dharma to offer this second pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, directly ascending to make offering to the Supreme and Most Perfect Sutra-Treasure. We prostrate ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Venerables of the Supreme. May this merit flow back to the nine generations of ancestors and all departed spirits of such-and-such a family. May their records of transgression be stricken from the registers of Fengdu, their souls refined in the Southern Flame. Calamities dissolve across kalpas, forever transcending the realm of the Five Sufferings; sins vanish without end, opening the path to deliverance from the Four Delusions. Those who suffer in the cold courts of night shall all behold the radiant light.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Host of Master Venerables, whose virtue is most perfect.

May their years be inscribed on the Tortoise Terrace, their longevity extended in the Phoenix Register. The clouds of the Five Turbidities disperse, the mists of the Four Demons vanish. Blessings extend without limit, misfortunes cease before they take form. May it extend to all beings, encompassing every sentient existence. May all escape the fruits of samsara, ascending together to the realm of wealth and longevity.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Host of Master Venerables, whose virtue is most perfect. After attaining the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the True.\n\nWe complete the rites and make our repentance.\n\n**The Hymn of Pacing the Void**\n\nWe

They bestow divine efficacy upon the wondrous origin, and the Dao’s functions are apportioned from the imperial ancestors. Heaven and earth are thus formed, and the sun and moon thereby illuminate. Myriad distinctions stand in array, unified by emperors and kings; the nine regions are extended, revered by the primordial sovereigns. They emulate heaven to establish their position, inheriting the sagely and continuing the foundation. The four seas gaze upon them, and all directions look up to them.

May this merit flow to the Three Realms and Ten Directions, to all heavens and earths, to the true immortals who govern, and to the spirits who oversee rivers and mountains. We humbly beseech that the Three Luminaries above be rightly aligned and that the myriad beings below flourish; that the eight winds be harmonized to nurture and sustain, and the six qi be ordered to shape and perfect. May we rectify customs and succor the people, deliver the hidden and pacify the state. May the blades of war be sheathed, frost-tipped spears spared the toil of repelling foes; may grain and harvests overflow, red cauldrons brimming with the auspicious glow of flowing light. May the wind of the Dao spread afar, its beneficent grace boundless.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of Masterly Worthies, in their virtue most true.

the word-transmitting and flower-scattering Jade Maidens, and the thirty-two Fragrant Officials of the Five Thearchs on duty this day. Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn attire, to open the gates of the Mysterious Altar’s Celestial Thearchs. Let them swiftly summon the local earth deities and territorial true officials to ascend and open the gates.\n\nThis servant now humbly offers this morning’s Daoist observances for the petitioner’s intent, praying that the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend, flowing into our bodies. May the Mysterious Altar be purified, inner and outer realms perfected as true, the heavens freed from impurity, and the earth cleansed of demonic dust. Let the chiming of jade resound, the Ten Directions grow solemn and clear. May the myriad demons not intrude, and our sincere prayers ascend unobstructed. Let this servant’s supplications swiftly reach the imperial throne of the Supreme and Boundless Great Dao, the Most Perfect Jade Thearch of the August Heaven.\n\n**Each Declares Their Dharma Rank**\n\nWith unified sincerity, we, disciples of the Mysterious Capital, humbly petition the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Spontaneous and Natural, the Boundless Great Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the August Thearch of the Golden Towers and Mysterious Primordial Heavenly Emperor, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Jade Thearch of the August Heaven, the perfected and sagely hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, the Heavenly Worthies who respond to conditions and deliver from suffering, the thirty-six Celestial Thearchs, the Jade Void Thearch, the Jade Thearch and Supreme Thearch, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Towers, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Illuminated August Lord of the Numinous Treasure, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Realm, and all responsive numina of the Three Realms.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves, having heard that the Perfect Dao extends its compassion, its mysterious efficacy aiding all beings. It unfolds its luminous transformation, shielding and succoring both the manifest and the hidden.\n\nThus do the flying celestial transcendents receive the teachings of the Jade Coffer’s Illuminated Perfected; the youths of supreme wisdom entreat the rites of the Jade Altar’s Three Registers. Proclaiming the Dharma’s resonance, they open deliverance for all ranks. Their benevolence encompasses state and household, their grace suffuses past and present.\n\nThe Emperor, mindful of meritorious worthies, pities the suffering of the dark and silent realms. The [deceased] official, grieving beyond the gates of the nether springs, cherishes remembrance in the hidden earth. We, in reverent cultivation of supreme merit, array the altar precincts, hoping to invoke the compassion of the Most Sagely and relieve the torments of the underworld’s barriers. Moreover, in obedience to the imperial edict, how dare we not make this known above?\n\n**Reading the Petition**\nAs the petition states, it is fitting to submit this plea.\n\nWe, your servants, reverently follow the wondrous decrees of the Nine Heavens and the scriptures of the Three Registers. Modeling our rites upon the patterns of Heaven and Earth, we present the liturgy of repentance and supplication. Above, we reach the Three Realms; below, we extend to the Nine Netherworlds. We burn incense and kindle lamps, recite scriptures and circumambulate the Dao. Silver braziers scatter radiance, hoping to illumine the endless night’s gloom; immortal hymns flow in melody, awaiting the descent of blessings from Heaven.\n\n**This morning’s ritual procession now begins.**\nThe Dharma assembly, having invoked the first pinch of incense, declares:\nMay this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most Supreme and Perfect Dao-Treasure.\n\nWe surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves, and reverently rely upon the Three Venerables of the Most High. May these merits flow to the august spirits of the altars of state, the ancestral line of sagely forebears, that they may ascend to the ranks of the Perfected and wander in the gardens of felicity. May they protect and bless the imperial domain, prolonging its reign for distant ages. May Heaven and Earth endure together, seas and mountains ever at peace.\n\nThus we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sagely Host of Perfected Ones, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the True Dao.\n\n**This morning’s ritual procession now begins.**\nThe Dharma assembly, having invoked the second pinch of incense, declares:\nMay this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most Supreme and Perfect Scripture-Treasure.\n\nWe surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves, and reverently rely upon the Three Venerables of the Most High. May these merits flow to the Emperor. We humbly pray that the azure waves of the vast sea may compare to his sagely longevity without end; that the myriad peaks and lands may stand firm with the imperial enterprise. May the empress, consorts, and attendants ever enjoy auspicious blessings; may the crown prince and princes perpetually renew their felicitous destiny. May civil ministers and military officers, all officials within and without, unite in loyal devotion, fostering a reign of benevolence, longevity, harmony, and prosperity. May the celestial element be serene and bright, the terrestrial order tranquil and secure. May grain harvests ever be abundant, weapons forever stilled. May blessings extend to all quarters, universally reaching all beings. Wherever the power of the Dao prevails, may the exalted and the lowly alike know peace.\n\nThus we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sagely Host of Perfected Ones, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the True Dao.\n\n**This morning’s ritual procession now begins.**\nThe Dharma assembly, having invoked the third pinch of incense, declares:\nMay this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most Supreme and Perfect Master-Treasure.\n\nWe surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves, and reverently rely upon the Three Venerables of the Most High. May these merits flow to the [deceased] official in the nether realms at this very moment. We humbly pray that the merit of this fast may ascend above, and the power of the Sagely One descend below. May the jade coffer’s sacred texts be opened, the Nine Dragons’ talismanic decrees be issued. May his numinous consciousness transcend and ascend directly to the Southern Palace. Passing through the courtyard of fire, may he refine and purge all impurities; entering the hall of luminous rosy clouds, may he don the radiant vestments of yang’s splendor. May he be elevated to the blessed realms, his name stricken from the ghostly registers. May the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages be transformed and reborn in Heaven; may the five clans and six relations receive blessings and protection. May grievances be cleansed, debts and disputes resolved. May the six destinies and three paths all partake of boundless fortune.\n\nThus we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sagely Host of Perfected Ones, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the True Dao.\n\n**Completing the Rites**\n**Confession**\n\n**Threefold Invocation**\nMay the Dharma be cherished as a wife,\nthe scriptures loved as pearls and jade.\nHolding fast to precepts to restrain the six passions,\nmindful of the Dao to dispel all desires.\nIn purity, the upright qi abides;\nin serenity, the spirit rests in silence.\nHeavenly demons all revere and guard,\nlife after life receiving boundless fortune.\n\n**Threefold Prostration**\nWe, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,\npaying homage to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.\nWe, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,\npaying homage to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,\npaying homage to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.\n\n**Reaffirming Dharma Ranks**\nWe, your disciples of the Supreme Clarity and Mysterious Capital, humbly reaffirm our devotion and reverently address:\nthe Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Origin;\nthe Supreme Great Dao Lord;\nthe Supreme Lord Lao;\nthe Ten Directions’ Spontaneous Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerables;\nthe Heavenly Venerable Who Responds to Conditions and Delivers from Suffering;\nthe Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;\nthe Heavenly Master Lord, Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center;\nthe High Ministers and Prime Ministers;\nthe Four Offices and Five Emperors;\nand all responsive and efficacious numinous beings within and beyond the Three Realms.\n\nWe, your servants, have heard that:\nthe two qi mold and refine,\nthe Five Phases engender and transform.\nYin and yang interdepend and alternate,\ngood and evil shift and transmute.\n\nWithin the snares of the worldly net, amid the mechanisms of transformation—\nthe six passions stir and disturb,\nthe three karmas entangle and constrain.\nSinking and drifting, adrift and submerged,\nsuch has been the unceasing plight from ancient times to the present.\n\nUnless one is endowed with the qi of the Dao from birth,\nor heaven-bestowed with immortal talent,\none cannot shatter the chariot of misfortune by ascending the ranks of blessings,\nnor traverse the cloud-lined thoroughfare to transcend the earthly realm.\nIn this fleeting, floating world,\nwho can escape the wheel of rebirth?\n\nThis official, since his birth into this life and through countless kalpas past,\nhas accumulated transgressions,\nhis sins amassing like a string of beads.\n\nAs a military officer, he may have drilled troops and commanded armies,\npunished the wicked and suppressed rebels,\nor in the midst of mowing down and eradicating,\nfound jade and stone indistinguishable.\nThough his service to the times may have been tied to establishing merit,\nhis reliance on killing and his pursuit of victory\nhave inevitably incurred guilt.\n\nMoreover, in the course of feasts and rewards,\nthere must be slaughter and roasting.\nIn enforcing the laws to punish the wicked,\nthere must be the execution of penal codes.\nThus, in cases of accidental or mistaken killing,\ntransgressions and violations are unavoidable.\n\nOr when soldiers march through camps and fortifications,\nencroaching upon and desecrating ancient tombs,\noffending and provoking dragon spirits,\ndigging and excavating hills and plains,\ndefiling and polluting springs and streams,\ntrampling sacred lands,\nand defiling numinous traces—\nthese acts may stem from unresolved past debts\nor unredressed former grievances.\n\nOr when, in the course of official duties,\nhe has wielded authority with personal bias,\nhis judgments in life bearing the stain of guilt,\nand in death facing karmic retribution—\nin the dark, hidden prisons of the underworld,\nthere is no means of repentance or redemption.\n\nAs a civil official, when administering affairs,\nhe may have acted willfully and indulged his inclinations,\nweighing punishments and discerning cases\nwithout regard for compassion or mercy,\nenforcing the law and upholding regulations\nwithout thought of pardon or leniency.\nIn matters of granting or withholding, encouraging or discouraging,\nhe may have erred in balancing severity and leniency.\nIn levying and collecting taxes,\nhe may have harmed through harshness and urgency,\nprovoking the resentment of people and the grievance of all things.\nThese offenses, once firmly established,\nmay stem from past debts or former grievances,\nor from defying heaven and betraying earth,\nyet he has never offered repentance or atonement.\nAccumulated in the courts of the underworld,\nsince the time of his death,\nkarmic retribution has befallen him,\nwith no means of deliverance or redemption.\n\nThe Emperor, mindful of his past merits\nand grieving for his journey to the netherworld,\nhas examined the standards of the Purple Yang,\nand unfolded the statutes of repentance and deliverance.\nHe has solemnly established the magnificent altar,\nand reverently implored the boundless grace of the heavens.\n\nWe humbly beseech the host of saints and sages of the myriad heavens,\nand the Three Supreme Venerables,\nto turn their limitless mercy\nand bestow the great compassion of their grace.\nMay they command the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus,\nthe Five Emperors and Four Offices,\nthe Thirty-Six Prisons of Mount Tai and Fengdu,\nto reconcile grievances and dissolve karmic retribution,\nto erase and cast away the records of sins.\nBy the edict of great pardon,\nmay he be released from the depths of darkness,\nreceive transformation in the Southern Palace,\nand be born upon the path of blessings.\nMay nine generations and seven lineages\ntogether partake in this radiant protection.\n\nMay all beings in the Three Paths and Six Realms,\nof every rank and kind,\nwhether moving or still, flying or submerged,\nascend to the shore of blessings.\nMay the Three Luminaries display auspicious signs,\nand the Four Seasons attain perfect harmony.\nMay the sacred lifespan be long and enduring,\nand the nation’s fortune prosperous and eternal.\nMay weapons be laid to rest,\nand plagues and poisons vanish.\nMay the hundred grains ever flourish,\nand all under heaven enjoy peace and prosperity.\n\nThus, the great compassion of the Most High Heavenly Venerable\nshall be manifest above,\nand the sincerity of our devotion in seeking refuge\nshall be fulfilled below.\n\nWe reverently present this petition for your hearing.\n\n**Invocation of Intentions**\n\nFirst intention: For the four great elements of the Dao,\nand the host of the retreat’s virtuous patrons—\nmay the seven generations of parents\nbe freed from sorrow and suffering,\nascend to the heavenly halls,\nand enjoy natural sustenance.\n\nSecond intention: For the Emperor and the lords of the realm—\nmay the Dao’s transformation flourish and prosper.\nMay the schools and academies thrive,\nand the imperial teachings expand in grandeur.\nMay their majesty and decorum be reverent and awe-inspiring,\nadmired by all under heaven.\nMay the people praise the Great Peace,\nand the four barbarians submit in deference.\nMay evil and malevolence self-destruct,\nand the worthy and sagely be born daily.\n\nThird intention: For the Dharma Master—\nmay his merit and virtue be greatly established,\nhis teachings enlightened and far-reaching,\nand may he, together with all, attain transcendence as an immortal.\n\nFourth intention: For fellow aspirants and disciples—\nmay they swiftly attain the Dao of immortality,\nand mutually guide and deliver one another.\n\nFifth intention: For the harmony of the nine relations—\nmay they esteem benevolence and righteousness,\nvalue the Dao and despise wealth,\nand their conduct serve as a model for all things.\n\nSixth intention: For self-denial—\nmay alms be given to Daoist priests and the hungry and cold.\nMay all people under heaven\neach find their rightful place.\n\nSeventh intention: For the crawling and creeping,\nall sentient beings—\nmay they all attain fulfillment.\n\nEighth intention: For the remission of past lives’ sins\nand this life’s karmic retribution—\nmay merits be established to compensate for transgressions.\n\nNinth intention: For the prosperity of the family—\nmay the ancestral temple be maintained,\nand worthy talents be born in every generation.\n\nTenth intention: For the reverence of scripture masters—\nmay they never falter in diligence,\nand with a mind of perfect equality,\nwidely deliver all beings,\nand attain transcendence as immortals.\nMay they ascend to heaven in broad daylight,\nand pay homage to the Most High.\nMay they forever become perfected beings,\nriding cloud chariots and feathered carriages,\nin harmony and union with the true Dao.\n\n**Replenishing the Crucible**\n\nFragrant Office Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attending Fragrance Spirits—may they cause this place of my audience with the Primordial to naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and jade blossoms. May the hundred numinous perfected beings gather here before the incense burner. May I, in learning the Dao, attain the Dao; in learning immortality, attain immortality. May the patron of this retreat receive blessings, and may both the hidden and manifest realms be graced with favor.\n\nMay the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions, attending the orchid-scented smoke, swiftly convey all that I have just petitioned directly to the Most High, the Boundless Dao, the Perfectly True Jade Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate before the Celestial Throne.\n\n*Exiting the Chamber*\n*End of the Sixteenth Scroll of the* **Yellow Register Retreat Rites of the Most High**\n\n---\n\n*Seventeenth Scroll of the* **Yellow Register Retreat Rites of the Most High**\n*Compiled by Master Du Guangting of Tang, by Imperial Decree, for the Subordinate’s Promotion and Merit-Transference through the Performance of the Dao*\n\n*Entering the Chamber*\nEach pays homage to the master, visualizing as prescribed.\n\n**Guardian Spirits**\nCinnabar numina, vermilion flames—\nradiant clouds ignite the winds.\nThe crimson wheel turns with刚 force,\ncelestial light surging through the eight directions.\nIts might bursts forth, encompassing all,\ntransforming myriad realms.\nMolten gold scatters, demons vanish without trace.\nEvil is dispelled, malevolence shattered—\nilluminating the primal work.\nGolden talismans summon and command,\ntreading clouds, spurring dragons.\nSongs of celebration resound,\nflowers scatter across the vast heavens.\nSpirits transmute in hidden motion,\nthe four extremities secure and prosperous.\nProstrate before the Celestial Throne,\nnone dare be irreverent.\n\n*Strike the Dharma Drum twenty-four times*\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Dao of the Three Heavens, the Primordial Three Qi of the Mysterious Origin—\nsummon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Golden Youths Attending Incense, the Jade Maidens Transmitting Words, and the Fragrance Officials of the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans and Direct Days—thirty-two each—to emerge.\nLet them, in solemn array, report to the Divine Lords of the Mysterious Altar of the Celestial Emperor, and urgently command the local earth deities and true officials of this realm to ascend and make their report.\n\nI now, on behalf of the intent of this rite, perform the audience with the Primordial. May I beseech the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure to descend, flowing into our bodies, thereby rendering the Mysterious Altar pure and both inner and outer realms perfected as true. May the heavens be free of defilement, the earth purged of demonic dust. May the jade chimes resound, the ten directions solemn and clear. May the myriad demons not intrude, and our sincerity ascend unobstructed. May all that I have petitioned swiftly reach the Celestial Throne of the Most High, the Boundless Dao, the Perfectly True Jade Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate.\n\n*Each declares their Dharma rank*\n\nSupreme Clarity, Mysterious Capital Disciples, your humble servants [Names] and all others, with unified sincerity, reverently petition the Vacuous and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, the Highest Lord of the Golden Portals of the Mysterious Origin, the Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate, the Most High Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heavens, the Great Sage Hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Cries and Saves from Suffering, the Perfectly True Lords and Venerable Ones, the Thirty-Six Celestial Emperors, the Jade Clarity Emperor, the Supreme Jade Emperor, the Eastern Flower, Southern Culmen, Western Numen, Northern Perfected, the Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Portals, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Numinous Treasure’s Perfectly True Radiant August Lord of the Dao, the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, and all responsive numina of the Three Realms.\n\nYour humble servants have heard that the Perfect Dao illumines the primordial, establishing transformation before Heaven. Though round and square differ in endowment, the hidden and manifest follow distinct paths.\n\nThe establishment of standards is no mere lure for goodness, nor the display of punishments a deterrent to those who would ascend through merit. The host of numinous sovereigns and administrators, arrayed in their offices and duties, leave nothing unattended, no matter how vast or minute, no detail too trifling to address. Thus is it intended that within the Three Realms and among all beings, each may strive to cultivate the heart and cease from evil, forsaking wrongdoing entirely. The scriptural teachings descend as guidance, demonstrating the rites of repentance and prayer. Illustrious maxims are clearly recorded, observed and revered from ancient times to the present.\n\nWe, your humble servants, have been graced by wondrous transformation and entrusted with offices of the Mysterious. Our aspiration is to aid the state in achieving merit and to deliver beings while benefiting all things. Now, having received these sacred instructions, how dare we not bring them before the throne?\n\nWe read the imperial words: The Emperor, reverently gazing upon the Mysterious Compassion, holds the Daoist canons in deepest awe. Moved by concern for the unseen and the obscure, he seeks to bestow auspicious blessings. Examining the statutes for the promotion of the truly worthy and consulting the ranks of repentance recorded in the *Yellow Register*, he ensures the peace of departed spirits. Thus, edicts are issued, silk and coin bestowed in solemn abundance, incense and flowers offered to purify and sanctify.\n\nWe, your humble servants, in strict adherence to the Mysterious Decree, array the imperial altar. To the four quarters and eight directions, we model Heaven and emulate Earth. We present our sincere words to the Three Realms, offering prayers of gratitude to the hosts of Heaven. May our crimson hearts be wholly poured forth to secure boundless fortune.\n\nToday, at the midpoint of the ritual, we, the assembled Dharma assembly, now offer the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the Supreme and Perfectly True Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full submission, gazing upward to the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits ascend to support the sacred spirits of the altars of soil and grain, their dignity enduring as long as Heaven’s pattern; may the ancestral temples and former sages share in the constancy of the Dao’s transformation. May the radiance of the Ten Flowers of Splendor shine forth, and the ascent to Perfection bring eternal joy. May great treasures of blessings descend, and vast foundations of fortune flow. May the prosperity surpass that of the Zhou and Han, and the duration of rule extend beyond that of the Xia and Shang.\n\nNow, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Masters, the host of Perfectly True Ones, whose virtue, having attained the Dao, ascended beyond form. Harmonious and united with the Dao, they are truly Realized.\n\nToday, at the midpoint of the ritual, we, the assembled Dharma assembly, now offer the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the Supreme and Perfectly True Treasure of the Scriptures.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full submission, gazing upward to the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits flow to the Emperor. We humbly pray that the sun’s brilliance may rise and spread, broadening his wisdom and clarity; that the Pole Star may soar in splendor, exalting his sacred longevity. May his virtue and power surpass that of Fuxi and the Flame Emperor, and his benevolence and sagacity crown the achievements of the Great Yu and Shaohao. May the myriad states rest in his heart, and the nine regions follow his transformation. May the Empress, consorts, and attendants reverently uphold the compassion of Yao; may the Crown Prince and the various princes radiantly disseminate the grace of Shun. May the dukes, ministers, civil and military officials, each fulfill their loyal and steadfast duties, eternally sustaining the flourishing destiny of the realm.\n\nNow, therefore, we kindle incense in reverent homage to the Great Sage Masters, the hosts of perfected virtue, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless—harmonized with the Dao, united with true reality.\n\nAt this moment, as we divide the ritual path, we invoke the assembly of the Dharma to offer this third pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke rise through the heavens, ascending directly to honor the Supreme Perfected Masters. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves in full submission, gazing upward to the Three Supreme Ones. May these merits flow to the official [Name] in the netherworld at this very hour.\n\nMay the hosts of the Three Clarities open the gates of the sun to stream forth radiance; may the exalted Eight Scenic Lords spread their cloud-borne chariots to bestow blessings. May the spirit be bathed and the soul refined, the form and hun cleansed. May transgressions be washed away, karmic debts and grievances pacified. May the departed ancestors and descendants alike be suffused in this fragrant cultivation.\n\nNow, therefore, we kindle incense in reverent homage to the Great Sage Masters, the hosts of perfected virtue, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless—harmonized with the Dao, united with true reality.\n\n**Ritual of Repentance**\n*Three Invocations*\nProsperous is the realm, flourishing the state,\nMajestic the scriptures, thriving the Dao.\nHeaven and humanity share a single vow,\nIn subtle ascent, they enter the Great Vehicle.\nBy the heart’s intent, the field of merit is established,\nThe Dharma-wheel rises in boundless ascent.\nMay the seven generations ascend to celestial halls,\nAnd my own form soar in the light of day.\n\n*Three Bows*\nWe, with utmost sincerity, bow our heads in reverence to the Supreme Boundless Dao.\nWe, with utmost sincerity, bow our heads in reverence to the Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, with utmost sincerity, bow our heads in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\n**Reverent Recitation of Dignities**\nThe disciple of the Mystic Capital of Supreme Clarity, your humble servant [Name], now respectfully and repeatedly petitions:\nThe Supreme Boundless Dao, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning;\nThe Supreme Lord of the Great Dao;\nThe Supreme Lord Lao;\nThe Perfected, Spontaneous, Numinous Treasure Celestial Venerable;\nThe Celestial Venerable Who Responds to Cries and Saves from Suffering;\nThe Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures;\nThe Celestial Master, Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;\nThe High Ministers and Prime Aides, the Four Directors and Five Emperors,\nAnd all the divine officials and venerable spirits of the Three Realms.\n\nWe, your humble servants, have heard that the myriad sages extend their compassion, and the Nine Heavens bestow their grace. They pity those exiled to the Three Wretched Paths and lament the drifting multitudes of the Six Realms.\n\nA single lapse in vital essence severs one forever from the realm of the worthy.\nThrough endless nights unbroken, ten thousand kalpas stretch without end.\nThus, as the Celestial Venerable surveys the Eight Gates, He reveals the scriptures of salvation for the living;\nMoved by compassion for the Three Realms, the Lord of the Dao proclaims the ordinances for deliverance from death.\nThat all may together ascend the courts of fortune and transcend the sea of desire.\nThe true scriptures and their wondrous purport rectify the state and transform the people.\nThe Emperor, mindful of the departed souls, publicly issues his sacred edict.\nIn accordance with the statutes of the Three Clarities, he opens the altar of the Nine Memorials.\nWith oil lamps, candles, incense, and flowers, he offers his sincerity to the host of sages.\nWith silk and ritual tokens, he presents his supplications to the myriad heavens.\nBurning incense, kindling lamps, reciting scriptures, and pacing the Dao,\nHe purifies his heart and cleanses his thoughts, prostrating himself to entreat the Perfected.\nHe hopes that the divine radiance of the Eight Luminaries will descend to illuminate the dark prisons of the netherworld,\nAnd that the talismanic commands of the Nine Dragons will swiftly arrive at the courts of accumulated night.\nTo deliver the souls in ceremony, raising them from the winding springs of the Yellow Springs.\nTo absolve and release [Name] Official, for transgressions across past lives and the present existence,\nFor boundless kalpas of accumulated faults and grievous errors, for past enmities and debts owed,\nWhether committed by oneself or bequeathed by ancestors,\nThe offenses are manifold, beyond memory or reckoning.\nSome defy Heaven and Earth, betraying the divine spirits;\nSome harm others or injure creatures.\nIn death, they suffer retribution, enduring it for years on end.\nWithout the mysterious power of the Dao, there is no means of release.\nNow, by the merit of this great fast and the cause of repentance and deliverance,\nMay the ten thousand sins and thousand transgressions all be eradicated and washed away.\nMay the divine souls be purified and serene, their sins and afflictions dissolved and pacified.\nMay they depart suffering, escape premature death, and attain realization of the Dao alongside the Perfected.\nMoreover, for the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages of the departed,\nMay they together bathe in this sublime merit and ascend the path of fortune.\nMay auspicious protection and blessings extend to the living.\nAbove, may the Two Images be clear and tranquil, the Three Luminaries harmonious and bright.\nMay wind and clouds follow their proper order, and malevolent forces sink and vanish.\nMay the imperial reign be boundless, and the Sacred Personage enjoy ten thousand years of life.\nMay the three agricultural seasons yield abundant harvests, with sprouting grain and ripening ears;\nMay the four seas be linked by ships and roads, with tribute of celestial beasts and rare fragrances.\nMay the empress, consorts, and imperial concubines, the crown prince and the various princes,\nSupport and assist the purple court, safeguarding the imperial ultimate.\nMay the dukes, ministers, and aides, the loyal and virtuous civil and military officials,\nAssist the ninefold throne and harmonize the eight directions.\nMay weapons be sheathed and silenced, and the myriad peoples enjoy peace and prosperity.\nExtending to the dragons of water and land, and all creatures that fly or dwell below,\nMay the merit of this fast reach them, and its beneficence spread far and wide.\nThroughout the seas and the world within, may all attain the realm of longevity.\nAbove, may the great compassion of the Radiant Celestial Venerable be manifest;\nBelow, may the sincerity of our repentance and gratitude be fulfilled.\n\nWe humbly present this entreaty.\n\n**Vows**\n\nFirst Vow: May the Great Dao be serene and void, tranquil and empty.\nMay it dwell in stillness and clarity, opening wide the gates of the Dharma,\nInstructing the stubborn and guiding them with beneficence,\nThat all may cultivate with diligence and, joining

restored.\n\nFragrant Bureau Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attending Fragrance Spirit-Officials, may this place of my audience with the Primordial cause gold-fluid elixir and azure mushroom blossoms to arise of themselves. May the hundred numinous perfected ones gather here together before the incense burner. May I, who study the Dao, attain the Dao; may I, who seek immortality, attain immortality. May the patron of the fast receive blessings, and may the hidden and manifest alike be graced with favor.\n\nMay the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions, attending amidst orchid incense, swiftly transmit my recent petitions directly to the presence of the Most High, Boundless, and Utmost Dao—the Perfected Jade Emperor.\n\n*Exiting the chamber*\n*End of Scroll Seventeen of the Most High Yellow Register Fast Rites*\n*Scroll Eighteen of the Most High Yellow Register Fast Rites*\n*Compiled by Tang Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting*\n*By special edict, for the subordinate’s promotion and advancement, to perform the \"Falling Radiance\" Daoist rites*\n\n*Entering the chamber*\nEach bows to the master, visualizing as prescribed.\n\n**Guardian Spirits Invocation**\nThe Five Stars shine brightly on high, auspicious qi soars and floats.\nThe Primordial Origin gathers the spirits, Heaven and Earth unite in full cycle.\nJade talismans and precious seals command the subtle and hidden.\nFire is cast and might displayed—no treachery or evil lingers.\nThe ten thousand demons tremble and submit, malevolent blooms disperse and vanish.\nMonsters are crushed, wickedness felled, as the Dao’s qi flows as one.\nDivine radiance illumines the night, shadows and darkness wholly withdrawn.\nThe myriad immortals descend in state, riding the winds on spreading light.\nAll beings attain fulfillment, grace pervades the divine realm.\nThe dharma drum resounds twenty-four times.\n\nThe Most High Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial Origin, the Three Qi’s Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officials, the Attendants of the Left and Right, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Fragrance Officials of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Direct Days—thirty-two of each—forthwith to emerge. Emerging, they solemnly prepare and open the gates of the Mysterious Altar’s Heavenly Thearch Divine Lords, and at once summon the local earth gods and territorial true officials to swiftly ascend and open the gates. This servant now, on behalf of the intent herein, conducts this evening’s audience and performs the Dao-ritual, praying that the Jade Purity’s Dao-qi and Numinous Treasure’s wondrous radiance descend and flow into the bodies of this servant and company, thereby rendering the Mysterious Altar pure and untainted, within and without perfected in truth.\n\nHeaven is free of foul vapors, Earth purged of demonic dust. Jade chimes resound, the ten directions grow solemn and clear. The ten thousand demons dare not intrude, true sincerity ascends unobstructed. May this servant’s petition swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme Non-Ultimate Great Dao’s Most Perfect Jade Thearch Emperor on High.\n\nEach declares their dharma-rank: Disciples of the Upper Clarity Mysterious Capital, this servant so-and-so and company, with reverent sincerity jointly petition the Void-and-Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Venerable One, the Non-Ultimate Great Dao’s Supreme Great Dao Lord, the Highest Great Dao’s Golden Portal Mysterious Primordial Heavenly Thearch Emperor, the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, the Jade Thearch Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the myriad perfected great sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions, the Most Perfect Spontaneous Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerable One, the Heavenly Venerable One Who Responds to Conditions and Comes to Save from Suffering, the Most Perfect Lords and Elders, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Thearch Lords, the Jade Void Thearch, the Jade Emperor and Supreme Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Portal, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity Upper Palace’s Numinous Treasure Most Perfect Illuminated August Dao Lord, the Thirty-Six Divisions’ Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Five Elder Thearchs, the Lords of the Three Origins, and the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water.\n\nExamine and assess transgressions and blessings, respond to the true numina of karmic resonance. This servant and company prostrate and hear: good and evil bear no form, but arise solely from human initiative.\n\nResponse and retribution never err, as echo follows sound. Past and present cycle endlessly, fortune and misfortune strike in turn. Thus the Northern Palace presides over death, the Southern Prosperity governs life. The numinous luminaries of Heaven and Earth weigh merit and record transgressions. Their vast loom weaves all things, leaving not even the slightest thread unaccounted. How could one fail to tremble and take heed, striving in reverence to uphold the Mysterious Precepts?\n\nTherefore, the Most Perfect Great Dao and the Supreme Dharma King have bequeathed the ritual of repentance and gratitude through the precious scriptures, and the golden tablets bear the intent of confession and supplication. With a single heart, one confesses and repents, and ten thousand sins are absolved and dissolved.\n\nThe Emperor mourns the departed souls, grieving for those lost in the dark night. He seeks to extend surpassing blessings to rescue those beyond the Yellow Springs. Imperial edicts descend, and reverent fasts are observed. Now, in obedience to the imperial decree, how dare we not make this known above?\n\nReciting the words—\nFollowing the text as spoken, its meaning runs deep with deliverance. We, your servants, consult the *Purple Yang Jade Tablets* and the *Yellow Register Scriptures*, modeling Earth upon Heaven, arraying the altar and setting forth the sacred texts. Solemnly we establish the Ten Radiant Positions and arrange the rites of the Four Poles. We prepare the ritual offerings of patterned silks, incense, flowers, oil, and candles, turning the scriptures and pacing the Dao, confessing and offering repentance to the myriad heavens.\n\nMay the true sages turn their radiance back upon us, bestowing blessings universally upon both the living and the dead. On this day, as the sun sets and the ritual procession begins, we, the assembled Dharma assembly, now raise the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the Most Perfect and True Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three August Ones of the Most High. May these merits flow back to our ancestral halls and the august spirits of the altars and soil. May the imperial lineage of Tang ascend in luminous purity, bestowing auspicious heirs. May the phoenix calendar extend its grandeur, enduring with Heaven and Earth without end. May the celestial origins shine brightly, and the earthly records remain at peace. May all nations gather in harmony, and all beings fulfill their nature.\n\nNow, therefore, we kindle incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of our Master, in the virtue of the Most Perfect Ones, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.\n\nAs the sun sets and the ritual procession begins, we, the assembled Dharma assembly, now raise the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the Most Perfect and True Treasure of the Scriptures. We, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three August Ones of the Most High. May these merits flow back to the Emperor. We humbly pray that his sagely radiance may gaze afar, his profound grace extend widely. Seated in the dark pavilion to concentrate the spirit, may he contemplate again the sacred registers; bending over the great rivers to display his brilliance, may he once more receive the precious charts. May the land’s vast foundations endure, and the mountains equal the Emperor’s sacred longevity. May the empress, consorts, and concubines assist in the vermilion court. May the crown prince and the various princes illuminate and propagate the grand transformation. May the civil and military ministers, the inner protectors and outer guardians, see their blessings renewed and their illustrious splendor flourish. May the three frontiers remain tranquil, forever free from the toils of border defenses; may the eight directions enjoy peace, ever receiving tribute from afar. May weapons be stilled, pestilence vanish. May floods and droughts never encroach, and the dragon spirits rejoice. May no malevolent omens arise, and the harvests be bountiful. May all sentient beings together enjoy supreme fortune.\n\nNow, therefore, we kindle incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of our Master, in the virtue of the Most Perfect Ones, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.\n\nAs the sun sets and the ritual procession begins, we, the assembled Dharma assembly, now raise the third pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the Most Perfect and True Treasure of the Master. We, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three August Ones of the Most High. May these merits flow back to the official [Name] in the netherworld at this very moment. We humbly pray that our sincere devotion may ascend, and the mysterious grace descend. May the Three Realms’ Primordial Honored Ones radiate divine light to illuminate; may the Sagely Ones of the heavens above bestow abundant blessings to nurture. May the nine springs open the paths of darkness, and the six destinies cease the sufferings of rebirth. May souls be refined and cleansed, grievances and debts reconciled. May sins and afflictions all dissolve, and blessings and auspiciousness gather abundantly. Extending to the three wretched realms and the seven generations of departed spirits, may all together bathe in this sublime merit and together attain the Dao’s fruition.\n\nNow, therefore, we kindle incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of our Master, in the virtue of the Most Perfect Ones, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.\n\nThe rites are now complete; we make our repentance.\n\n**Threefold Invocation**\n\nThe Great Dao pervades the Mysterious Void,\nWith devotion, none fails to align.\nRefining the essence, one enters the Immortal True,\nAnd attains the Vajra body.\nTranscending the Three Realms’ trials,\nThe Five Sufferings of Hell dissolve.\nAll return to the Supreme Scriptures;\nIn stillness, we bow in reverence.\n\n**Threefold Prostration**\n\nWe, your servants, wholeheartedly prostrate and bow to the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao.\nWe, your servants, wholeheartedly prostrate and bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, wholeheartedly prostrate and bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Realm.\n\n**Reaffirming the Dharma Rank**\n\nWe, disciples of the Supreme Clarity and Mysterious Capital, your servants [Name] and others, with utmost sincerity, jointly invoke:\nThe Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin;\nThe Supreme Lord of the Great Dao;\nThe Supreme Lord Lao;\nThe Most Perfect, Spontaneous, Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy;\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Cries and Saves from Suffering;\nThe Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;\nThe Heavenly Master and Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Realm;\nThe Supreme Ministers and Prime Ministers;\nThe Five Elderly Lords of the Supreme;\nThe Lords of the Three Primes;\nThe Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water;\nAnd all the responsive and efficacious venerable spirits of the Three Realms.\n\nWe, your servants, have heard that the Great Sages unfolded the cosmic plan, and the Primordial Sovereign guided the course of destiny. The celestial gates nurture all life, while the earthly records shape all things. Among all beings, humans are the most spiritually endowed, standing above all other creatures. Yet as yin and yang alternate, the nature and consciousness of beings ebb and flow. In conduct, there arise distinctions of good and evil; in movement and stillness, outcomes of fortune and misfortune are determined. Through sin and blessing, one ascends or descends; through life and death, one is separated or united. Therefore, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and the Heavenly Great Sage, in their boundless compassion, issued the decree of salvation and opened the gate of protection. They commanded the Five Emperors and Four Controllers to extend their mechanisms of deliverance, and the hosts of the Three Primes and all the Sages to respond and govern. The Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water revealed the principles of judgment, while the clerks of the yin and yang bureaus proclaimed the rites of retribution. Their intent was to enable all to ascend the steps of blessing and together transcend the net of sin. Yet the deluded remain hard to awaken, and the turbid hard to purify. Transgressions and errors accumulate without end.\n\nThis official, from past lives to the present, through countless kalpas, has undergone the revolutions of rebirth. Whether through the constructions of the six senses or the deeds of the three karmas, the offenses are manifold and beyond recollection. At times, leading armies and commanding multitudes, he waged campaigns in all directions. At others, upholding the law and maintaining order, he regulated and restrained others. Sometimes punishing the wicked and suppressing the violent, he wielded the axe to assert authority. Or protecting the weak and curbing the strong, he dispensed rewards and meted out punishments. At times, undertaking construction and earthworks, he offended the dragon spirits. Or hosting banquets and feasting guests, he slaughtered living beings. Sometimes angling for the hidden or fowling the roosting, he galloped in the hunt. Or adjudicating legal codes, he judged cases with partiality. At times, swayed by love and hate, joy and anger, he indulged his whims. The sorrows of the living and the grievances of the dead accumulated as unrepented sins in the dark underworld. The Three Officials record the names of the guilty, and the Five Emperors tally the accounts of retribution. In the shadowy night prisons, to whom can one turn for deliverance?\n\nThe Emperor, moved by compassion for the suffering souls, wishes to elevate and deliver them. Following the regulations and standards, he has solemnly established the altar. Divine lamps scatter their radiance through the Nine Netherworlds, and incense wafts its fragrance across the Three Realms. We universally repent sins before all the heavens and pray for grace throughout the Ten Directions. We humbly beseech the Supreme Sages and High Worthies to shine their merciful light in pity; may the Three Officials and Five Emperors let their vast blessings flow abundantly. Bestow boundless grace and magnify the great acts of compassion. May all sins, without exception, be washed away. Even those in the Four Extremes and the Ten Immortals shall be discerned and illuminated. Draw them forth from the depths of the Dark Prison and guide them to the Courts of Flowing Fire. Purify their forms and souls, and bathe their spirits. May they ascend to the Realm of Eternal Joy and soar to the Upper Palaces. Realize the Dao and partake in the True, forever escaping the dark night.\n\nMay all past grievances and debts be resolved with devotion. May accumulated sins and residual calamities dissolve in an instant. May descendants enjoy blessings, and may distant ancestors ascend. May all beings—whether moving or still, flying or submerged—within the suffering realms touched by this ritual’s merit, together partake in auspicious fortune.\n\n**Supreme Vows**\n\nMay the sun and moon shine with steadfast clarity, and may Heaven and Earth stand firm in peace. May the stars and constellations be auspicious, and may wind and rain be timely. May the great enterprise flourish, and may the Sacred Person enjoy myriad years. May the imperial lineage, like the branches of Heaven, forever shade the Eight Extremes; may civil virtue and martial prowess encompass the Nine Provinces in transformation. May weapons be sheathed, and may the harvests be abundant.

May the hosts of the Hundred Spirits and all the Perfected gather here before the incense burner and the altar of fragrant fire. May we who study the Dao attain the Dao, and those who seek immortality attain immortality. May the patrons of this ritual receive blessings, and may both the hidden and manifest realms be graced with favor. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the Ten Directions, guarding the orchid incense, swiftly transmit our recent invocations directly to the presence of the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Most Perfect Jade Emperor.\n\n**Exiting the Chamber**\n\nHere concludes the eighteenth scroll of the *Rites of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast*.\n\n**Nineteenth Scroll of the *Rites of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast*\nRevised by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting\nA Minister’s Dawn Ritual for the State’s Disaster Dispelling and Dao-Pursuit**\n\n**Entering the Chamber**\nEach bows to the masters, visualizing as prescribed.\n\n**Guardian Spirits Invocation**\nAzure yang illumines the void, radiance returning to the numinous.\nDivine tigers repel evil,\nFlying immortals stream with bells.\nCrush treachery, annihilate trials—\nTen thousand demons bind their forms.\nNinefold subtleties revolve the Dao,\nEightfold mights seize essences.\nA thousand Perfected audit records,\nThe Three Origins purge all defilement.\nTo the left, the Central Yellow roars;\nTo the right, the Six Dings are commanded.\nSeven revolutions, eight unions—\nTraversing the celestial scriptures.\nMajestic transformations tower,\nThe Three Ways proceed in harmony.\nAuspicious clouds flow forth,\nMerging with the Yellow Court’s luminous scene.\n\n**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**\nO Most Supreme Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial Three *Qi*’s Supreme Dao Lord, summon forth from within this minister’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Incense-Bearing Golden Youths, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-two each—to emerge.\nLet them, in solemn array, report to the Mysterious Altar’s Celestial Thearch and Divine Lords, urgently commanding this land’s local deities and true officials to ascend and receive the report.\nThis minister now, on behalf of the stated intent, performs the dawn’s *qi*-uniting and Dao-pursuing rites. May the Jade Clarity’s Dao *qi* and Numinous Treasure’s wondrous radiance descend, flowing into our bodies.\nThus shall the Mysterious Altar be purified, inner and outer made true.\nHeaven freed of miasmic filth,\nEarth cut off from demonic dust.\nJade chimes resound—\nThe Ten Directions grow solemn and clear.\nNo myriad demons shall intrude,\nTrue sincerity ascends.\nMay this minister’s petition swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Most Perfect Jade Emperor.\n\n**Each Declares Their Dharma Rank**\nWe, disciples of the Mysterious Capital of Supreme Clarity, jointly and sincerely petition the Self-So, Natural Primordial Heavenly Venerable, the Boundless Great Dao’s Supreme Great Dao Lord, the Lofty Great Dao’s Golden Watchtower Mysterious Primordial Heavenly Thearch, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Jade Thearch of the August Heaven, the Ten Directions’ Attained Great Sage Perfected Lords and Masters, the Thirty-Six Celestial Thearchs, the Jade Clarity Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Watchtower, Seven Treasures’ Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace’s Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord, the Thirty-Six Divisions’ Venerable Scriptures, the Mysterious Center’s Great Dharma Masters, and all responsive and perceptive true numina of the Three Realms.\nWe prostrate and hear: the Great Dao’s proclamation spreads, the Three Powers establish their stations. Emperors set the ultimate standard, the Four Great Ones share equal reverence.\n\nThus are states inaugurated and lands governed, the multitudes shepherded and all beings tended. With regal tassels draped and screens of state behind, the sovereign presides over the myriad regions. Though sagely rule emulates Heaven, it must draw upon unseen aid; when times are harmonious and customs prosperous, it is truly by the work of numinous power. Therefore, we reverently observe the constant rites of suburban sacrifice and prepare the grand ceremonies of auspicious purification. Bearing Heaven and serving Earth, we manifestly honor the Supreme Mystery.\n\nNow, as calamitous fate converges and adversity takes shape, we must pray for auspicious blessings to usher in peace and prosperity. So-and-so, such-and-such an official, deeply concerned for the sovereign and earnestly devoted to governing the realm, devoutly conducts purification rites and vigil, hoping to move the true numina. We, unworthy as we are in our offices of the Mysterious Bureau, deem it our duty to submit this memorial. Humbly receiving the imperial decree, how dare we not make this known above?\n\n**Reading the Petition**\nAs the petition states, the matter concerns the altars of state and the fate of the realm. We feel the virtue of nurturing completion and bear the grace of encompassing sustenance. Without knocking at the Gate of Mystery, one cannot hope for radiant protection. Therefore, with solemn reverence and earnest devotion, we establish the imperial altar. Our hearts soar toward the Azure Vault, our prayers ascend to the Pure Capital.\n\nAt this dawn’s ritual, the assembly of Dharma-initiates and we raise the first incense pinch. May this fragrant smoke ascend to offer reverence to the Most High and Perfect Dao Treasure. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves, and look up in devotion to the Three Supreme Ones of the Most High. May this merit flow to the august numina of the altars of state and the ancestral shrines of former sages, merging with the Mysterious Ultimate and feasting in the Cinnabar Terrace of Effulgent Light. In the Golden Watchtower and Jade Capital, we present the sagely designs to the Primordial Beginning; in the Jeweled Charts and Sacred Records, we extend great blessings to the divine descendants. When transformation prevails, seas will be calm and rivers clear; as blessings flow, Heaven will endure and Earth will last.\n\nNow, we burn incense in devotion to the Great Sage Assembly of Master and Honored Ones, the virtue of the Perfected, who after attaining the Dao ascended into formlessness, harmonizing with the true Dao.\n\nAt this dawn’s ritual, the assembly of Dharma-initiates and we raise the second incense pinch. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High and Perfect Scripture Treasure. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves, and look up in devotion to the Most High Venerable Scriptures. May this merit, above all, wish the emperor’s auspicious radiance to coalesce at the imperial throne and blessings to gather upon his sagely person. May he shine with the brightness of sun and moon, illuminating the ten thousand dwellings; may he emulate the virtue of Heaven and Earth, nurturing and sheltering all living beings. May the empress, consorts, and concubines gloriously uphold the great treasure; may the heir apparent and imperial princes harmoniously assist in the grand enterprise. May the ministers, officials, meritorious generals, and wise counselors—both civil and martial—together bring peace to the realm and its seas.\n\nThis day we kindle incense, surrendering body and life to the Great Sage Host of Venerable Masters, whose perfect virtue, having attained the Dao, preserves Heaven’s eternal abiding.\n\nHarmony unites with the true Dao.\n\nAt this pure dawn of ritual practice, we invite the assembly of the Dharma to offer this three-pinch incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend through the void, directly upholding the Most High and Perfect Treasure of Masters. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves, and look up in devotion to the Three Supreme Masters. May this merit flow forth to the heavens above and below, to the Three Realms and Ten Directions, to the divine hosts of the Great Dao and all the sagely beings of the heavens.\n\nWe humbly pray for the stabilization and pacification of the imperial destiny, that the sagely dynasty be blessed with trust and protection. May their majesty shine with the awe of snow, frost, thunder, and lightning, rightly governing the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. May all things be nurtured and brought to fruition, while malevolent spirits and pernicious demons are vanquished. May calamities be swept away and the imperial lineage prolonged.\n\nMay the Five Sacred Peaks stand tall, the Eight Pillars remain steadfast. Ever encircling the imperial throne, may they eternally uphold the imperial pole. May the Nine Mysteries ascend and be delivered, and all beings revive in clarity. May the myriad multitudes enjoy peace and well-being, and weapons of war be stilled. May all creatures—whether soaring or sinking, endowed with consciousness—together partake in prosperity and uprightness.\n\nThis day we kindle incense, surrendering body and life to the Great Sage Host of Venerable Masters, whose perfect virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless.\n\nHarmony unites with the true Dao.\n\nThe rite is complete. We repent.\n\nThe \"Threefold Invocation Hymn\"\n\nTo take the Dharma as one’s wife,\nTo cherish the sutras as pearls and jade.\nBy upholding precepts, the six passions are restrained;\nThrough mindfulness of the Dao, desires are dispelled.\nIn purity, the true qi abides;\nIn serenity, the spirit rests in silence.\nHeavenly demons all revere and protect,\nAnd through every life, great blessings are received.\n\nThe Threefold Prostration\nWe, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao.\nWe, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\nReaffirming the Dharma Ranks\nWe, your disciples of the Supreme Clarity and Mystic Capital, servants [Name] and others, with deepest sincerity, once more reverently invoke:\nThe Most High, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin;\nThe Most High Lord of the Great Dao;\nThe Most High Lord Lao;\nThe Perfect and Supreme Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;\nThe Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;\nThe High Ministers and Prime Chancellors, the Four Directors and Five Emperors, and all the divine officials and spirits of the Three Realms.\n\nWe, your servants, humbly recall:\nThe Three Venerables established the teachings, prioritizing sincerity and resonance;\nThe Supreme Sages transmitted the precepts, holding solemnity and reverence as their foundation.\n\nShould we express our unadorned sincerity, it shall surely reach the august spirits.\n\nWe reflect that from the inception of creation to this very day, the sovereign cannot spread transformation without the people, nor can the people attain tranquility without the sovereign. The sovereign aligns with Heaven, and the king establishes the ultimate standard. How could they not draw upon the power of creation and rely upon divine efficacy? Only then can they transmit glory through generations and perpetuate blessings across the ages.\n\nSince the primordial past, states and households have endured. Those who faithfully adhere to the principles of purity and quiescence are graced by the profound blessings of the Mysterious Origin. The Emperor, upholding Heaven’s mandate and grasping the cosmic order, has assumed the throne in accordance with destiny. Reverent, frugal, benevolent, and harmonious, he labors diligently over all affairs of state, ever more vigilant with each passing day. Yet even as he governs with ceaseless diligence, darkness and adversity still afflict the realm. Without recourse to the Supreme Dao, how could peace and deliverance be achieved?\n\nThe official [Name], long renowned for his great merit, redoubles his earnest devotion. Devoted to the sovereign and the state, he knows no rest. Thus, with utmost reverence, he prepares fragrant flowers, abundant offerings, and solemn pledges of faith. Laying bare his heart before the Three Realms, he bows in homage to the heavens. He exhausts his luminous sincerity, humbly beseeching auspicious protection.\n\nMay his crimson petition ascend, and the profound grace of the Mysterious descend. May the awe-inspiring power of transformation be bestowed, preserving the Emperor’s distant and enduring reign. Let the decree command the Nine Heavens, and the celestial hosts patrol the Eight Extremities. May wind and thunder sweep away the miasmic vapors, clearing the cosmos, and annihilate calamities to secure the altars of state. Let treacherous omens be purged, the sun and moon shine with steadfast clarity, and comets and baleful stars be driven away. May weapons of war melt like ice, rebellious ministers and their factions reform their hearts, and epidemic plagues and malevolent spirits vanish like clouds dispersed by lightning.\n\nMay the Hua and Yi peoples alike joyfully follow the winds of virtue, and the entire realm delight in the radiance of sagely governance. May the official [Name] enjoy emoluments as lofty as Mount Song and Mount Heng, and years as enduring as the pine and cassia. May he forever uphold loyalty and filial piety in service to his sovereign and parents. May the Emperor’s sagely longevity rise like the North Star and Mount Tai, his illustrious reign extend as far as the heavens and earth endure. May all beings, seen and unseen, ascend to the realm of longevity.\n\nThus, the transformative compassion of the Most High Heavenly Worthy is made manifest, and the sincerity of your servants’ devotion is answered.\n\nWith reverence, we make this declaration.\n\n**Invocation of Intentions**\n\nFirst intention: For the Dao, the Four Great Elements unite in virtue. May the seven generations of the retreat’s sponsor be freed from sorrow and suffering, ascend to the heavenly halls, and enjoy natural sustenance.\n\nSecond intention: For the Emperor and rulers of states, may the Dao’s transformation flourish.

May we never falter in devotion, cultivating equanimity and single-mindedness. May all beings be broadly delivered, attaining the rank of immortals, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, and paying homage to the Most High. May we forever become perfected beings, riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages, harmonizing with the Dao and uniting with the Real.\n\n**Replenishing the Incense Burner**\n\nTo the Incense Officials and Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attendant Incense Spirits: May this\n\nBy this the high and low are fixed, and kingdoms rise.\nThe sovereign is the head, governing both the unseen and the manifest.\nExercising the power of yin and yang to nurture all things,\nholding the reins of joy and sorrow for the myriad people.\nAccordant with Heaven, embodying the Dao,

the forms of the Three Registers and the Nine Purities.\nWith fragrant flowers we offer our sincerity, and with tokens of faith we convey our devotion.\nWe pour forth our crimson sincerity in the mortal realm, awaiting the mysterious blessings of the celestial palace.\n\nAt this moment, as the Dao is practiced in the midst of the ritual,\nwe, the assembled ritualists, now raise the first pinch of incense.\nMay this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to the Three Venerables of the Most High.\nMay these merits flow to the august spirits of the altars of state and the ancestral temples,\nascending to the Three Realms, treading the Ten Flowers.\nBestowing great blessings to enrich the grand design,\ngranting extraordinary omens to prosper the sacred lineage.\nIn the lands of fire-mice and ice-silkworms, may no corner lack the imperial calendar;\namong the ministers of Cock Forest and Child Tree, may songs of praise resound in harmony.\nSurpassing the millennial reigns of old, exceeding the boundaries of Yu’s domain.\n\nThus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sagely Hosts, the Perfected Ones,\nwho, having attained the Dao, ascend into the formless.\nHarmonized and united with the true Dao.\n\nAt this moment, as the Dao is practiced in the midst of the ritual,\nwe, the assembled ritualists, now raise the second pinch of incense.\nMay this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to the Three Venerables of the Most High.\nMay

pinch of incense.\nMay this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters.\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves,

and disciple, we have received and cultivated the teachings.\nYet our bodies dwell far from cloudy springs, our traces lost in the dusty sea.\nOur merits have not yet aided the state, our Dao has not yet attained ascension.\nWe can but rouse our cinnabar resolve, hoping to repay the mysterious creation.\n\nMoreover, in establishing merit and propagating the teachings, aiding the state takes precedence.\nIn all sincere supplications, how dare we fail to comply?\nOfficials [Name] and [Name], encountering times of calamity and adversity,\ngrieve for the nation in their hearts.\nWith devout

May this servant’s petition swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme Non-Ultimate Great Dao’s Most Perfect Jade Thearch of the August Heaven.\n\nEach proclaims their dharma rank:\nThe disciples of the Supreme Clarity’s Mysterious Capital, this servant and others, with unified sincerity, reverently address the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Non-Ultimate Great Dao’s Supreme Great Dao Lord, the Highest Great Dao’s Golden Portal Mysterious Primordial August Thearch, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Jade Thearch of the August Heaven, the perfected and sagely hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the thirty-six Heavenly Lords, the Jade Void Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, the Mysterious Capital’s Jade Capital, Golden Portal, Seven Treasures’ Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity’s Supreme Palace, the Numinous Treasure’s Most Perfect Illuminated August Lord of the Dao, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, and all true numina of the three realms’ official retinues.\n\nThis servant has heard that when the three systems first divided and the myriad states spread like a chessboard, without emperors and kings, there would be none to govern and pacify; without the Dao and virtue, there would be none to secure and stabilize.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns embodied the Dao, ruling as lords over the Five Emperors, proclaiming virtue to perfect transformation. Thus the people cherished simplicity and sincerity, and customs attained pure harmony. The six qi were balanced and harmonious, the four seasons peaceful and prosperous. Thereafter, yin and yang fell into discord, the nine and six clashed in opposition. The Flame and Yellow Emperors saw the rise of military campaigns; Yao and Tang encountered the calamities of flood and drought. They relied upon the abundance of virtue, and leaned upon the numinous power of the gods. The myriad spirits of heaven and earth all lent their hidden assistance. When encountering adversity, it is fitting to pray to the true numina. Following the rites of reverent offering, may boundless blessings descend. Moreover, in accordance with the imperial decree, how dare we not report this above? The prayer is read.\n\nAccording to the words of the prayer, the ritual concerns the state and the household. Official So-and-so, with utmost sincerity, aids and supports, yearning in reverence for the august numina. Presenting offerings of faith, he devoutly performs the fast and vigil.

Traversing the myriad heavens to offer thanks, he circumambulates the ten thousand sages in homage.

We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up in reliance upon the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits flow to the august numina of the altars of soil and grain, the ancestral temples and former sages, ascending their spirits to the Purple Palaces, bestowing blessings upon the imperial domain. May they befriend the Five Emperors in the Jasper Palace, freely roaming in ease; may they bequeath a thousand auspicious signs to the imperial heirs, flourishing without end.\n\nThus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Assembly of the Master and the Perfected, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nTonight, during the evening audience and Dao-circumambulation, the dharma assembly is invited to offer the second pinch of incense.

We humbly pray that the precious calendar of the Nine Heavens may augment the sagely longevity without bound; that the jasper waves of the Eight Seas may widely expand boundless prosperity. May his brilliance surpass the sun and moon, illuminating all without partiality. May his virtue parallel the Two Modes, embracing and nurturing all things. May the Empress, consorts, and concubines spread their gentle virtue throughout the nine regions; may the Crown Prince and the various princes radiate their illustrious splendor through ten thousand generations. May the civil and military ministers, the officials within and without, propagate and disseminate the imperial designs, vigorously promoting the grand transformation. Extending to the distant frontiers and foreign lands, may all realms constantly enjoy harmony and peace, attaining the perfection of the Dao.\n\nThus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Assembly of the Master and the Perfected, who after attaining the Dao preserved the heavens and endured eternally, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nTonight, during the evening audience and Dao-circumambulation, the dharma assembly is invited to offer the third pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most Perfect and True Treasure of the Master. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up in reliance upon the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits extend throughout the Three Realms, universally reaching all directions. Together may they spread the mysterious merit, jointly proclaiming the vast blessings. Invoking the upright qi of the Three Heavens, may they cleanse and eliminate the treacherous and malevolent; summoning the divine soldiers of the Eight Poles, may they annihilate and pacify demonic afflictions. May the great enterprise flourish, the grand foundation be firmly established. May Official So-and-so be divinely aided with auspicious blessings, his heavenly endowment of longevity enduring. May he forever revere loyalty and filial piety, constantly serving the sagely brilliance.\n\nThus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sage Assembly of the Master and the Perfected, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nThe rites are concluded.\nConfession and repentance.\n\n**Threefold Invocation Hymn**\nThe Great Dao pervades the mysterious void,\nWith thought, none fails to harmonize.\nRefining the form to enter immortality,\nThus attaining the adamantine body.\nTranscending the three realms’ tribulations,\nHell’s five sufferings are dissolved.\nAll return to the Supreme Scriptures—\nIn stillness, we bow in reverence.\n\n**Threefold Prostration**\nWe, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,\nBowing to the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao.\nWe, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,\nBowing to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,\nBowing to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.\n\n**Reaffirmation of Dharma Ranks**\nDisciples of the Supreme Clarity and Mysterious Capital, your servants [Name] et al., now reverently reaffirm our supplication to the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Origin; the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Perfected and Utmost Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the High Ministers and Prime Chancellors; the Four Directors and Five Emperors; and all divine officials and venerated spirits of the Three Realms.\n\nWe, your servants, have heard that the sagely sovereign, robed in grace, governs the multitudes of the realm. Upholding Heaven’s transformative mandate, embodying the Dao to rule the seasons, he must manifest reverence for the Supreme Mystery to secure radiant blessings, and foster harmony in the lands below to perpetuate the grand design. Thus, the Dao of Heaven subtly sustains, while divine spirits secretly assist. Heaven and humanity interact in resonance, and the seas and lands enjoy tranquility.\n\nRecently, as the cyclical nine and six converge, yin and yang fall into discord. Calamities arise in the course of destiny, causing inner and outer realms to share in sorrow. Official So-and-so, deeply committed to governing the state and earnestly devoted to serving the sovereign, seeks to amplify supreme blessings and reverently serve the sagely court. He has examined and adhered to canonical rites, meticulously upholding the Dharma’s sanctity. His heart races toward the Three Realms, his thoughts fixed upon the myriad heavens. Reverently establishing the altar, he devoutly conducts the fast and vigil.\n\nWe, your servants, purify our hearts and still our thoughts, bathing in clarity and emptiness. We burn incense and light lamps, recite scriptures, and circumambulate the Dao. Our sincere words ascend to the Ten Poles, our prayers for protection directed to the Three Clarities. We humbly beseech the Supreme Dharma King and the assembly of Perfected Sages: gazing down from jade pavilions, may you bestow vast blessings to universally bestow grace. Rectify the celestial origins, harmonize the earthly principles. Let the Three Luminaries shine brightly, the Five Planets follow their courses. Comets and baleful stars conceal their forms, while auspicious stars manifest their blessings. The eight winds align in sequence, the six qi balance in harmony. Drought and flood are averted, disasters and malevolent forces eradicated. Mountains and rivers remain serene, fierce beasts retreat and vanish. Customs become pure and virtuous, creatures free from plague. Ghosts and demons flee without trace, evil and perverse forces are crushed and destroyed. Barbarians submit in reverence, borderlands enjoy peace. Treacherous ministers and rebellious sons offer loyalty and devotion. Beacons remain unlit, weapons fall silent. The imperial enterprise flourishes, the sagely lifespan endures. The court abounds in loyal and worthy officials, the countryside harbors no neglected talents. The six palaces and hundred ministers together propagate the wind of virtue and power; the crown prince and various kings jointly support the vast and grand enterprise. Ships and caravans gather in full, harvests are ever abundant. May Official So-and-so be truly blessed with auspicious fortune, his official emoluments and state sacrifices renewed.\n\nMay even those in the dark springs and cold underworld, the six destinies and three paths, be illuminated by the radiance of wisdom, forever dispelling gloom and obscurity. May the divine wind cleanse impurities, attaining perfect coolness and purity. May all crawling, flying, sinking, and soaring beings ascend to the Dharma realm. Above, may the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy be manifest; below, may the sincerity of our repentance and gratitude be fulfilled.\n\nWe respectfully present this supplication for your hearing.\n\n**Vows**\nFirst vow: May the Great Dao flow universally, and all under Heaven embrace virtue.\nSecond vow: May all sentient beings awaken to the Dao.\nThird vow: May the souls in the nine nights of darkness attain liberation at once.\nFourth vow: May the lonely and unsupported spirits all receive rebirth.\nFifth vow: May the world enjoy great peace and the five grains abundant harvests.\nSixth vow: May ministers be loyal and sons filial, rulers benevolent and fathers kind.\nSeventh vow: May the four seas be united, and enmities and affections reconciled.\nEighth vow: May those in hidden wombs and eggs all attain birth and completion.\nNinth vow: May chronic and recent illnesses swiftly be healed.\nTenth vow: May orphaned and destitute beings enjoy ample clothing and food.\n\n**Replenishing the Incense Burner**\nIncense Official Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Attendant Incense Spirits, and all divine officials: at the place where we conduct the Dao, may golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms naturally arise.

transformation,\nAssisting the upright and repelling the perverse.\nExtending to the hidden and the manifest,\nAll together attain the wondrous Dao.\nAbove, we manifest the Celestial Venerable’s vast salvific grace;\nBelow, we fulfill your servants’ sincerity in surrendering our lives.\n\n**Initiating the Vows**\nFirst vow: For the sake of the Dao’s four great elements,\nUniting in virtue with the

Dao divided,\nthe sages established teachings.\nDrawing from the *Yijing*’s images,\nthey modeled themselves upon the Supreme Mystery.\n\nHaving established the norms for constructing halls and beams, they replaced the ancient nests and caves. To benefit all under Heaven and shelter the multitudes of beings, they commanded the deities of Heaven and Earth, the marshals of yin and yang. They divided ranks and arranged hierarchies, each with its proper charge. From ancient times to the present, these have been reverently observed, and no deviation has marred fortune or misfortune.\n\nThe patron of this retreat, [Name], having recently undertaken construction and renovation, fears that excavation may disturb sacred traces or encroach upon the abodes of spirits; that it may offend the qi of repose and prosperity or transgress the directions of taboo. Thus, an altar has been prepared to offer repentance and supplication.\n\nWe, your servants, consulting the *Hetu*’s graded standards and unfolding the ritual canons of the Three Caverns, lead the Dharma assembly in earnestly conducting this retreat. We prostrate ourselves beneath the Three Luminaries and lay bare our hearts before the myriad sages. We repent our transgressions and faults, beseeching grace and pardon. May our sincere devotion move the true numina to descend.\n\nWe respectfully invoke for the disciple [Name]:\n**Cangming Jiubai Jun**, **Anque Tianxuan Jun**, **Tianxiu Tianyang Jun**, **Jiehuan Dunyuan Jun**, **Chisha Tianguan Jun**, **Xianguan Jiping Jun**, and **Shiyang Shanzhi Jun**;\n**Qinglong Daoyuan Jun**, who presides over the peace of dwellings and the prosperity of residences, dispels calamities and averts anomalies, subdues pernicious qi, and suppresses wayward spirits;\nwho breaks the edge of poisonous curses and extinguishes inauspicious omens.\n\nWe further invoke:\n**Hanming Dihuang Jun**, **Wushang Jianqi Jun**, the **Furnace and Fire Jade Maidens**, and the **Vanguard Inspectors of the Great Hosts**, who govern the collection of ghosts dwelling in wells and hearths within the residence.\n\nWe also invoke:\n**Yang Fangping Shijun**, who governs the collection of qi from mounds and tombs beneath the earth and the deities of taboo, ensuring the free flow of upright qi and the suppression of malevolent forces. May the dwelling abide in purity and peace, ever secure in well-being; may the household enjoy auspicious omens and the gate know no untimely misfortune.\n\nMay the six relations be blessed with fortune, and the nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven.\nMay longevity and prosperity be extended, and transgressions and faults dissolved.\nMay grievances and enmities be reconciled, and legal entanglements sink into oblivion.\nMay inner and outer realms know purity and peace, and all movements and stillness be luminously unimpeded.\n\nAbove, may the sagely enterprise endure long, and the imperial destiny stretch far into the distance.\nMay the myriad states rest in harmony, and the eight directions submit to transformation.\nMay heaven be clear and earth bright, the nation prosperous and the people joyful.\nMay auspicious omens and felicitous signs be recorded day by day and month by month.\nMay wind and clouds bestow their blessings, and seas and mountains relax in ease.\n\nExtending even to the six destinies and nine nether realms, to all sentient beings with consciousness,\nmay they all partake in vast fortune and each attain carefree bliss.\nMay the dragon spirits of the dwelling and the yin-yang officials of their ranks\nbe rewarded for their merits and stationed securely in their domains.\nFrom the hidden to the manifest, may all universally attain flourishing peace.\n\nAbove, may the radiant Heavenly Worthy grant great mercy;\nbelow, may the sincerity of this assembly’s devotion be answered.\nWe reverently make this declaration known.\n\nWe now offer our vows:\n\n**First Vow:** May the Great Dao abide in tranquil emptiness, serene and still, dwelling in clarity of its own accord.\nMay the gates of the Dharma be widely opened to instruct the stubborn and deluded.\nMay all receive its beneficent grace and cultivate with diligent austerity.\nMay those who study together universally ascend to the void,\npreserving harmony with heaven and abiding in perpetual freedom from care.\n\n**Second Vow:** May the various heavens condense their qi into purity,\ntheir vast expanse high and encompassing, preserving truth and securing the numinous.\nMay the seasons be harmoniously regulated, the four movements balanced in peace.\nMay the nation be secure and the people prosperous, the world universally tranquil.\nMay all be broadly succored, and beneficence extend to all living beings.\nMay the heavens be preserved for eternity, unshaken through kalpas without end.\n\n**Third Vow:** May the earth’s capacity to bear and sustain be boundless,\nstable and unyielding, its seas and abysses unshaken.\nMay it securely guard the nation and the people flourish in accord.\nMay the living be nurtured and the dead rest in peace, beneficence pervading the ten directions.\nMay crops and grains thrive, and commerce daily prosper.\nMay all receive its abundant support, and the myriad beings follow in harmony.\n\n**Fourth Vow:** May the sun and moon, the two luminaries, shine in lofty brilliance,\nfree from eclipses or dimming, their waxing and waning serene and clear.\nMay their light illumine the heavens, dispelling all darkness.\nMay they safeguard the kalpic destiny and the world’s destiny know peace.\nMay their beneficent moisture be universally bestowed, showering grace upon all beings.\n\n**Fifth Vow:** May the stars shine with brilliance equal to the sun,\ntheir revolving radiance illuminating the ten directions.\nMay each abide in its proper place, their paths straight and true.\nMay they securely guard the nation, free from calamity or harm.\nMay the four seas be united in tranquility, and the world universally prosper.\n\n**Sixth Vow:** May the four seasons progress in accord with their nodes,\ntheir qi harmonious and balanced, free from disaster or affliction.\nMay pestilence and poison be extinguished, and the world know universal peace.\nMay the five grains ripen in abundance, the nation prosperous and the people joyful.\n\n**Seventh Vow:** May floating clouds gather their qi and amass their mists,\nsoaring high in the empty sky, casting their shadow over the profound.\nWhen concealed, they abide in non-action;

Assisting the state is foremost, compassionate salvation the foundation. Should there be any petition, how dare we not report it above?\n\n**Reading the Petition**\nWe, your servants, having examined the sincerity of the petition, find it proper to submit for imperial consideration. The **fast-master** [Name], regarding his dwelling, has undertaken repairs and renovations, yet fears transgressing against the divine or violating taboos. Earnestly he offers repentance and purification to atone for faults and flaws. Thus, in accordance with canonical rites, he reverently establishes the altar, unfolds the **Mysterious Capital’s Jade Tome**, and follows the **Yellow Register’s** scriptural texts. Modeling earth upon heaven, he conducts the fast and performs the Dao.\n\nTonight, at the evening audience, as the ritual proceeds, we, the **Dharma assembly**, now present the **first pinch of incense**. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the **Most High, Perfect, and True Dao-Treasure**. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the **Three Honored Ones of the Most High**. May this merit flow to the ancestral spirits of the imperial lineage and the luminous ranks of former sages. May the Emperor ascend to the highest realms, securely establishing his grand destiny. May it illuminate all directions like the sun and moon, nurturing all beings like the three luminaries. May the Crown Prince, consorts, and empresses radiantly assist in this flourishing. May civil and military officials aid in the perfection of sagely transformation.\n\nThus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the **Great Saints, the Perfected**, and the virtue of those who, having attained the Dao, ascend beyond form, harmonizing with the Dao in truth.\n\nTonight, at the evening audience, as the ritual proceeds, we, the **Dharma assembly**, now present the **second pinch of incense**.

We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the **Three Honored Ones of the Most High**.

May the myriad demons not intrude, and true sincerity ascend. May this servant’s words swiftly reach the **Jade Throne of the Supreme Vast Dao, the Formless and Nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, in the Golden Palace**.\n\n**Each Declares Their Dharma Rank**\n\nWe, your humble servants, [names] and all present, with one heart offer this petition to the **Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin**, the **Peerless Great Dao, Supreme Great Dao Lord**, the **Supreme Lord Lao**, the **August Jade Emperor**, the **Perfected and Sages of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao**, the **Thirty-Six Celestial Thearchs**, the **Jade Clarity Supreme Emperor**, the **Great Emperor of the Jade Thearch**, the **Eastern Flower, Southern Ultimate, Western Numinous, Northern True, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Palace, Seven-Jewel Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity Supreme Palace, Lingbao Perfected and Radiant August Dao Lord**, the **Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures**, the **Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center**, the **Nine Lands’ Jade Emperors**, the **Four Offices and Five Thearchs**, and all responsive and perceptive true spirits of the Three Realms.\n\nWe have heard that at the inception of heaven and earth, the transformations of yin and yang gave rise to all things. They fashioned the myriad forms and governed the myriad regions, all bearing the ungoverned work of the Dao and harmonizing with the principle of non-action. Yet when the Great Dao receded, pure transformation ceased to flow. Dwellings replaced nests and caves, and the omens of extravagance arose from earth and wood. Thus, both the manifest and hidden realms transgressed divine prohibitions. Therefore, the rites of repentance and gratitude were established, eliciting the wondrous response of resonance.\n\nFor this reason, the **Three Honored Ones** expounded the teachings, and the **Ten Thousand Sages** suspended the statutes. The **Five Talismans** revealed the mechanisms of exorcism and pacification; the **Three Treasures** opened the instructions of repentance and prayer. This servant, having been permitted to partake in the true teachings, has presumptuously assumed this office. It is fitting to assist the state, establish merit, rescue the perilous, and aid the common folk. Whatever words are herein contained, we dare to present them fully.\n\n**Reading the Petition**\nIn accordance with the words of the petition, it is fitting to make this report.\n\nDisciples of such-and-such, considering the unsuitability of our dwelling’s construction, contemplate establishing the merit of a purification rite to express expiation and gratitude. Reverently following the statutes and canons, we erect an altar and precinct. We burn incense, kindle lamps, recite scriptures, and circumambulate the Dao. May our petition ascend, thereby eliciting wondrous resonance.\n\nOn this day, as such-and-such officiates the circumambulation, we, the assembled ritualists, offer the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the Supreme and Most Perfect Dao-Treasure. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, and look up in reliance upon the Most High Three Honored Ones. May this merit flow to the ancestral temples and altars of the sacred dynasty, to the numinous spirits of the soil and grain. May its radiance ascend to the Ninefold Purity and its blessings extend to the myriad realms. May it safeguard the flourishing fortune of the realm and subtly assist the sagely designs. May the Emperor’s virtue embrace the Two Modes and his illumination equal the Two Luminaries. May no one be left destitute in the wilds, and may the court abound in loyalty and integrity. May the Empress and consorts inherit winds of well-being, and may the inner and outer realms together partake of the transformation of peace.\n\nThus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Host of the Most Perfect and True, whose virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the True Dao.\n\nOn this day, as such-and-such officiates the circumambulation, we, the assembled ritualists, offer the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the Supreme and Most Perfect Scripture-Treasure. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, and look up in reliance upon the Most High Three Honored Ones. May this merit flow to the household of disciple so-and-so. May the nine generations and seven lineages, the myriad ancestors and ten thousand forebears, transcend the dark night and ascend to behold the light. May they refine their essences in the Southern Palace and be born into the celestial realms. Moreover, may all beings in the three wretched destinies and six paths of rebirth, though differing in kind, together bathe in the fragrance of cultivation and ascend the path of fortune.\n\nThus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Host of the Most Perfect and True, whose virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the True Dao.\n\nOn this day, as such-and-such officiates the circumambulation, we, the assembled ritualists, offer the third pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the Supreme and Most Perfect Master-Treasure. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, and look up in reliance upon the Most High Three Honored Ones. May this merit flow to the household of the purification rite’s sponsor, so-and-so. May the six affinities and five clans, all kin and relations, avert future calamities, absolve past transgressions, renew their blessed destiny, and prolong their years. May their dwellings be fittingly situated and the dragon spirits securely pacified. Thereafter, may all beings—whether soaring or sinking, animate or inanimate—together receive the mysterious grace and universally partake of the vast beneficence.\n\nThus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Host of the Most Perfect and True, whose virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the True Dao.\n\n**Paying Homage to the

Thearchs.\nSummon now the local Earth Gods and Territorial True Officers,\nthat they may receive this servant’s intent and prayers:\nmay the wondrous luminous radiance of the Jade Clarity Dao-qi and Numinous Treasure descend,\nflowing into the bodies of this assembly,\nso that the words this servant has uttered\nswiftly reach the Jade Palace beneath the Most High, Boundless Great Dao—\nthe

Treasure Perfected and Radiant August Lord of the Dao,\nthe Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures,\nthe Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,\nand all divine officials of the Three Realms.\n\nWe humbly observe:\nthe Two Modes weave the warp of existence; the Five Agents engender transformation.\nFortune and misfortune intertwine; cold and heat alternate in succession.\n\nThe cycles of prosperity and decline know no constancy; the gates of calamity and fortune stand ever open.\nIn their greatest manifestation, Heaven and Earth may conjoin or obstruct, and kalpas shift through transformation.\nAt the next level, good and evil intertwine in turmoil, stirring dread and peril.\nYet this Supreme Dao encompasses the Void and Non-Being.\nWithout beginning or end, it attains the wondrous subtlety of the imperceptible;\nboundless in compassion and love, it extends the statutes of salvation.\nAll evils are dispelled; no disaster remains unresolved.\nWe, your humble servants, have been granted access to the profound mysteries and partaken of the subtle essence of the Dao.\nOur resolve is to establish merit and assist in the unfolding of transformation through the ages.\nOn the day we received the Dharma, we ascended the altar and pledged our vows:\nto protect the state and deliver the people, and to widely proclaim the grace of compassion.\nFor all who turn toward the Dao, how dare we fail to bring this before the divine?\nWe recite the words, presenting them in utmost sincerity.\n\nWe establish the altar and ritual space to dissolve misfortune and transgressions.\nSearching the scriptural teachings and adhering to canonical rites,\nwe invoke the Jade Decrees and True Scriptures, the dragon-script and phoenix-seal,\ncondensing clouds and coalescing qi to form sacred writ.\nWe safeguard and stabilize the Emperor, pacifying calamitous destinies,\ngoverning the turning of kalpas, and subduing demonic forces.\nUniversally delivering all beings, we greatly propagate the divine transformation.\n\nIn accordance with this intent, we join in earnest supplication,\nburning incense and kindling lamps to beseech blessings.\nNow, at this morning audience in the performance of the Dao,\nwe, the assembled Dharma practitioners, offer the first pinch of incense.\nMay this fragrant smoke ascend directly to honor the Supreme Treasure of the Perfect Dao.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in reverence,\nand look up to the Three Supreme Ones.\nMay these merits flow to the august spirits of the state and ancestral temples,\nto the divine ancestors of the imperial lineage, and to the numinous vastness of the Great Silence,\nwhere they may repose in the Ninefold Purity.\nRoaming the Purple Courts in freedom, ascending the Vermilion Mound in joy,\nmay they bestow auspicious blessings for countless generations.\nFor the Emperor and Empress, the imperial consorts and princes,\nthe dukes, ministers, civil and military officials,\nwe pray for the stability of the imperial reign and the longevity of the Sacred One.\nMay the loyal and righteous assist in the sagely enterprise,\nthe inner and outer domains flourishing in the splendor of imperial rule.\nMay all quarters know peace, the eight directions be free from peril,\nand the winds of the Primordial and Pure spread far,\nreturning all to the harmonious transformation of the Great Dao.\n\nNow, we burn incense in devotion to the Great Sage Masters,\nthe Perfected and Divine Ones, whose virtue attained the Dao,\nascending beyond form to merge in harmony with the True.\n\nAt this morning audience in the performance of the Dao,\nwe, the assembled Dharma practitioners, offer the second pinch of incense.\nMay this fragrant smoke ascend directly to honor the Supreme Treasure of the Perfect Scriptures.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in reverence,\nand look up to the Three Supreme Ones.\nMay these merits flow to our own families,\nto the nine generations of ancestors and the sevenfold lineage,\nto the lingering spirits and obstructed consciousnesses.\nMay they be reborn in the Cinnabar Mound, shedding their mortal forms,\ntheir earthly disputes resolved, their posthumous trials ended.\nMay they roam the celestial realms and dwell in the courts of bliss.\n\nNow, we burn incense in devotion to the Great Sage Masters,\nthe Perfected and Divine Ones, whose virtue attained the Dao,\nascending beyond form to merge in harmony with the True.\n\nAt this morning audience in the performance of the Dao,\nwe, the assembled Dharma practitioners, offer the third pinch of incense.\nMay this fragrant smoke ascend directly to honor the Supreme Treasure of the Perfect Masters.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in reverence,\nand look up to the Three Supreme Ones.\nMay these merits flow to all beings under Heaven, to all who possess consciousness,\nreaching even the depths of the Yellow Springs and the hidden recesses of the unseen.\nMay distant blessings suffuse all, and every heart know peace.\nMay the disciple [Name]’s misfortunes cease, their adversities dissolve,\ntheir longevity and fortune increase, and blessings gather abundantly.\n\nNow, we burn incense in devotion to the Great Sage Masters,\nthe Perfected and Divine Ones, whose virtue attained the Dao,\nascending beyond form to merge in harmony with the True.\n\nThe Rites Conclude\nRepentance\n\nLet each meditate upon the nine-hued perfect image, swallow the divine saliva, and intone the secret incantation to command demons. Step into the void, circling the Supreme Ultimate—its height and depth divide, the light and pure ascending to join Heaven.\n\nShould one cultivate the utmost Dao,\nthe body becomes a true immortal.\nTheir deeds surpass the three thousand,\ntheir time spans forty thousand years.\nThe cinnabar terrace opens its treasure scrolls,\nthe golden mouth transmits the flow.\nThe Great Brahmā, Lord of the Three Heavens,\nthe Five Venerable Ones of the Void Sovereign—\neven they scarcely glimpse its wondrous subtlety,\nhow much less can it be captured in words.\nThe jeweled throne descends upon the golden hall,\nthe rosy crown illumines the jade pavilion.\nMyriad perfected ones attend the imperial court,\ntheir flying sandals treading the roots of clouds.\nMisty as fine mist, drifting,\ntheir gossamer robes trail gently.\nExquisite, they ascend with auspicious smoke,\nlightly following the soaring phoenix.\nHaving partaken in the jade chamber’s feast,\nthey suddenly point toward the grotto-heaven’s return.\nStanding at Fusang’s shore,\nthey race toward the radiance of the Sun Emperor.\n\n**Three Bows**\nWe, your servants, prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity to the Supreme and Boundless Dao of the Great Ultimate.\nWe, your servants, prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\n**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**\nWe, your humble servants [Name] and others, now reverently reaffirm and address the Supreme and Boundless Dao, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning; the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao and the host of sagely ones of virtue; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; the High Ministers and Prime Chancellors, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, and all divine officials of the Three Realms.\n\nWe have heard that the Great Dao sheds its light, spreading harmony and transformation. It shapes and steeps the primordial qi, giving birth to the Three Powers. Yin and yang alternate in their cycles, kalpas rise and fall in their destined turns. Endowed with spirit and nurtured in form, beings take shape and flow into manifestation. Before transcending the mechanism of change, they are bound to signs of prosperity and decline. Without invoking the supreme sages, blessings are hard to bestow.\n\nWe reflect upon the jade books of the Three Caverns, the golden tablets of the Nine Heavens—turtle-scripted phoenix scrolls, dragon-sealed tiger tallies. These can stabilize emperors and kings, safeguarding the kalpas; embodying the boundless Dao, they endure with Heaven. Next, they can restore the celestial canon, altering the course of disasters; pacifying families and protecting nations, aiding beings and bringing peace to people. The netherworld receives their deliverance, and the distressed find means of expiation. When fragrant incense ascends, sincere prayers surely reach. When the true register is presented, the august spirits surely witness.\n\nThe disciple [Name], fearing misfortune in their fate and deeply troubled, presents offerings and petitions, praying for manifest protection. We, having received the luminous teachings, exhort and guide the Dharma stream. Following the mystic statutes, we undertake this fast to cultivate blessings, invoking the Three Realms and repenting to the Ten Directions. Pouring forth our sincerity, we turn the scriptures and perform the Dao. Lamps divide like crane flames, dispelling darkness with flowing radiance; incense scatters like dragon smoke, piercing the void to convey our faith.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Celestial Worthy and the Supreme Ones bestow their compassionate salvation; that the Golden Towers and Jade Capitals, the thousand perfected ones, extend their protective power. May decrees descend upon the Three Realms, universally proclaiming to all heavens. Bestow blessings, extend grace, deliver the living and ferry the dead. Reconcile grievances, dissolve disasters. Let the five phases avoid harmful clashes, and the three luminaries cease inauspicious conjunctions. Above, resolve the afflictions of celestial bodies and the twelve celestial mansions; below, resolve the calamities of mountains and rivers, the nine palaces, and the eight trigrams’ domains.\n\nFor accumulated transgressions and deep misfortunes, layered disasters; for past grievances and old debts, unintended killings and mistaken harms; for the three karmas and six emotions, boundless offenses—through this repentance, we beseech their complete eradication.\n\nWe pray that the nation’s destiny be prolonged, the sage’s longevity eternal; that the three luminaries shine brightly, the four seasons harmonize. May weapons of war not rise, beacon fires cease their warnings. May evil demons hide, auspicious omens arrive. Floods, fires, droughts, locusts, wars, and plagues—may none assail our borders, and may perfect peace be preserved.\n\nWe further pray that the seven generations of ancestors ascend to Heaven, the nine depths of darkness be released from confrontation. May all beings, flying and crawling, fulfill their natures and dwell in peace. May the earthly prisons and yin tribunals, the three paths and six destinies, all ascend to the shore of blessings, bathed in the wind of the Dao.\n\nAbove, may the Celestial Worthy’s vast salvific grace be manifest; below, may it match the sincerity of we, your servants, in our devotion. We reverently present this petition.\n\n**Invoking the Ten Resolutions**\nFirst resolve: For the four great elements of the Dao, in harmony with the virtue of the fast’s sponsor. May the seven generations of parents escape suffering and sorrow, ascend to Heaven’s halls, and enjoy natural sustenance.\n\nSecond resolve: For the emperor and sovereign, may the Dao’s transformation flourish. May academies thrive, the imperial teachings expand. May their majesty be awe-inspiring, witnessed by all under Heaven. May the people praise great peace, the four barbarians submit. May evil demons perish, sages and worthies be born daily.\n\nThird resolve: For the Dharma masters, may their merit and virtue be greatly established. May their teachings be clear and far-reaching, all attaining immortality.\n\nFourth resolve: For fellow practitioners. May they swiftly attain the immortal Dao, mutually guiding and delivering one another.\n\nFifth resolve: For the nine relations to be harmonious, valuing benevolence and righteousness. May they honor the Dao and despise wealth, their conduct a model for all.\n\nSixth resolve: For self-denial, bestowing alms upon Daoists and the hungry and cold. May all people under Heaven find their rightful place.\n\nSeventh resolve: For crawling and creeping creatures, all sentient beings. May they all receive fulfillment.\n\nEighth resolve: For pardoning past lives’ debts. May this life’s karmic retribution be resolved through merit, amending past wrongs.\n\nNinth resolve: For the prosperity of family and nation. May ancestral temples have descendants, and worthy talents be born in every generation.\n\nTenth resolve: For honoring the scripture masters. May we never falter, maintaining equanimity and single-mindedness. May we broadly deliver all beings, attaining the highest immortality, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight, paying homage to the Supreme. May we forever become perfected ones, riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages, merging in harmony with the True.\n\n**Returning to the Brazier**\n\nTo the Fragrant Office Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant spirit-officials of incense: May the place where I offer this incense spontaneously generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred numinous perfected ones gather here, assembling before the brazier in the cavernous chamber. May I, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality. May I encounter those of karmic affinity and realize the fruit of non-action. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions receive this fragrant smoke and swiftly convey the words I have just uttered directly to the August Presence beneath the Jade Towers of the Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Golden Portal of the Supreme Limitless Dao.\n\n*Exiting the chamber*\nEnd of the Twenty-Sixth Scroll of the *Yellow Register Retreat Rites of the Supreme*\nBeginning of the Twenty-Seventh Scroll of the *Yellow Register Retreat Rites of the Supreme*\nRevised by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting\n\n*Disaster-Dispelling Procession in Mid-Retreat*\n*Entering the chamber*\nEach pays homage to the master, visualizing as prescribed.\n\n**Guardian of the Numinous**\nThe Yellow Center commands qi, severing demonic traces.\nIt suppresses the sources of evil,\nrestrains and severs demonic tracks.\nBy the Supreme’s talismanic decree,\ndivine efficacy is summoned and controlled.\nThe myriad spirits are thus subdued,\naverting calamity and dispelling misfortune.\nThe Three Wheels of Royal Qi\ncirculate the True Wind through the cavernous void.\nThe Purple Portal bestows jade,\nconferring boundless deliverance.\nTo the left, the Azure Waist is commanded;\nto the right, the Mushroom Youth is summoned.\nRiding the carefree winds of light,\nthey govern the Nine Empyreans.\nThe Mystic Altar responds to the moment,\nmounting qi in the void’s expanse.\nThe ten thousand perfected descend universally,\ndelivering without end.\n\n*Strike the Dharma Drum twenty-four times*\n\nThe Supreme Mysterious Origin, the Most High Dao Lord, summons forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Golden Youths attendant upon incense, the Jade Maidens who scatter flowers and convey words, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talisman and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-two each in number. Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn attire, to report to the Divine Lords of the Mystic Altar of the Heavenly Thearchs. Let them summon the local earth deities and territorial spirit-officials, that they may, in accordance with the present intent, receive the descent of the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure, flowing into our bodies. Thus shall the Purple Clarity’s luxuriance surge forth, and the Jade Towers blaze with brilliance. The Five Elders shall support the root, and the myriad thearchs shall gather the true. Bodies shall reflect the round pearl’s glow, riding the light to the imperial court. Golden radiance shall blaze resplendently, mounting qi to ascend the Upper Clarity. May the words I have uttered swiftly reach the August Presence beneath the Jade Towers of the Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Golden Portal of the Supreme Limitless Dao.\n\n*Each states their dharma-rank*\n\nWe, your humble servants, [Names] and others, with utmost sincerity jointly address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous Origin, the Supreme Limitless Dao and Most High Dao Lord, the Supreme Lord Lao, the August Jade Thearch, the perfected and sagely hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the thirty-six Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Clarity Supreme Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, and the Golden Portal of the Mystic Capital, the Seven Treasures, the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm, and all the spirit-officials of the Three Realms.\n\nWe humbly recall that as the Dao’s workings unfold and the Primordial August One bestows transformation, the true and numinous manifest their blessings, and heaven and earth respond with auspicious signs. The two correct qi are rectified in the Upper Mystery, and the three calamities are stilled in the lower realms. Thus are all things harmonized and at peace, and all living beings receive blessings and protection. The household and state are universally tranquil, and the dark and hidden realms are universally benefited. We have long received the mysterious grace, bathed in its vast blessings. We have studied and borne the precious texts, perused the true canons. Following the Supreme’s great compassionate decree and the Heavenly Worthy’s universal deliverance, we aspire to establish modest merit to aid the great transformation. We deliver beings and rescue creatures, relieving distress and aiding the imperiled. We assist the state and serve the times, hoping to offer our sincere devotion. For all our words and petitions, dare we not make them known above?\n\n*Reading the Petition*\nAs the words declare, we deeply cultivate and reverently serve.\n\nMay we beseech the sagely grace to dissolve calamities and misfortunes. With reverence, we prepare fragrant flowers and present the ritual offerings. Our hearts pledge before the Three Realms, our lives surrender to the hosts of heaven. Following the mysterious canons, we undertake the fast and vigil. We purify our minds, still our thoughts, kindle lamps, and burn incense. We perform the rites of the *Fahe Tu* for expiation and thanksgiving, adhering to the litanies of the Great One for supplication. Our sincerity hastens to the Golden Gates, our contemplation reaches the Jade Capital. May we attain resonance and receive manifest protection.\n\nAt this noon audience, as we perform the Dao, the assembly of ritualists now offers the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most Supreme and Perfect Dao-Treasure. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to the Three Worthies of the Most High. May these merits flow to the imperial destiny and the august lineage, to the ancestral temples and the sagely succession. May the reign transcend the Three and Five, the Dao surpassing Fuxi and Shennong. May the sovereign roam the Purple Pole in spirit, repose in the Crimson Mound and shed his form. Ascending to the ranks of the perfected above, bestowing blessings upon the august lineage below. May the emperor’s longevity equal the Eight Seas, his radiance illumine the Two Effulgences. May Yao’s clouds broadly cover, Shun’s sun ever brighten. May the six palaces embody the rule of gentleness and compliance, the hundred officials uphold loyalty and steadfastness. May all directions be pure and prosperous, the four seas tranquil and orderly.\n\nNow, as we burn incense, we take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the virtues of the Perfected, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nAt this noon audience, as we perform the Dao, the assembly of ritualists now offers the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most Supreme and Perfect Scripture-Treasure. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to the Three Worthies of the Most High. May these merits flow to the family of the fast’s sponsor, to their karmic bonds through kalpas, their accumulated generations of kin. May the ninefold darkness of lingering attachments and the sevenfold ancestors’ spiritual forms ascend to the sagely hosts in the heavens, escaping the long night’s entanglements. May their transgressions be forever erased, their immortal ranks attained.\n\nNow, as we burn incense, we take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the virtues of the Perfected, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nAt this noon audience, as we perform the Dao, the assembly of ritualists now offers the third pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most Supreme and Perfect Teacher-Treasure. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to the Three Worthies of the Most High. May these merits flow to the sponsor’s household. May past faults be absolved, calamities and misfortunes cease. May the living and deceased flourish, their kin secure and peaceful. Even in the cold realms of the earth-prison, may all receive deliverance. May the Three Paths and Nine Nights all behold the light. May the world enjoy harmony and well-being, the land know no disasters or pestilence. May those dwelling in mountains and valleys attain the Dao and ascend to perfection.\n\nNow, as we burn incense, we take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the virtues of the Perfected, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\n*Ritual Concludes*\n*Confession and Repentance*\n\nEach visualizes the nine-hued perfect image, swallows saliva, and recites the secret incantation to command demons. Stepping into the void, circling and weaving—\ncloud-net steps ascend, celestial winds suddenly blow.\nSleeves flutter past the Dipper’s handle, whisk in hand they bow to the Banner of Stars.\nLions bear cinnabar tassels, qilin lead jade-green chariots.\nSoaring through the eight poles, how often do spring branches bloom?\nGreen wings tower in crimson headbands, azure mists entwine feathered robes.\nAt dawn they hasten to the knot of solar virtue, by night they arrive at the moon’s radiant gate.\nThey grasp and play with the fires of the celestial sphere, then conceal and stir the earth’s mechanisms.\nThe Jade Chamber cannot detain them—they soar back toward the nine heavens.\n\nLong ago in the Hall of Extended Grace, at midnight the Nine August Ones descended.\nSix Perfected divided left and right, yellow mist coiled through the galleries.\nWithin the vast palace, the divine lords were revered; immortal soldiers guarded the Daoist sanctuary.\nNow the filial descendant continues

Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; the High Ministers and Prime Chancellors; the Four Directors and Five Emperors; and all divine officials and revered spirits of the Three Realms.\n\nWe have heard that when the Most High unfurled the charts, the myriad spirits received blessings.\nWhen the Perfected expounded their grace, all beings flourished in glory.\nThe proper lodgings were measured by celestial reckoning, and calamities were stilled by earthly records.\nDivine winds brought tranquility, and the hidden and manifest revived.\n\nMoved by the urgency of disasters and decline, we earnestly seek purification through repentance.\nWe present offerings of incense, flowers, and ritual tokens, along with brocade and patterned silks.\nWe pledge our sincerity and offer our hearts, beseeching heaven to grant life.\n\nFollowing the ritual codes, we have prepared the altar.\nBurning incense and lighting lamps, we illuminate the Three Realms—\nabove, the boundless realms of the

karmic grievances of eons be universally absolved.\nMay the nine lineages receive deliverance and attain purity.\n\nThen, may the disasters of stars, planets, sun, and moon—even the dark luminaries—be

ninefold charts, and mountains resound with ten thousand years.\n\n**For the Disciple**\nMay the disciple [name] open the deliverance of the nine lineages, his entire clan secure and peaceful.\nMay he propagate loyalty and filial piety to transmit his household, embody benevolence and harmony to continue his legacy.\nMay all sentient beings, even those in the hidden and dark realms, each attain their proper place.\n\n**For Ourselves**\nMay we perfect the six virtues and realize the three expedients.\nMay we dwell in valleys and cold retreats, attaining the fruit of perfection.\nAbove, may we manifest the great compassion of the Celestial Worthies;\nbelow, may we fulfill our earnest devotion.\n\n**Petitions**\nWe humbly present our plea.\n\n**Vows**\nFirst vow: May the Great Dao abide in

golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs.\nMay the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones gather here before the incense burner.\nMay I, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality.\nMay the patron of this retreat receive blessings, and may the hidden and manifest alike be graced with favor.\nMay the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the orchid-scented smoke,\nConveying the words I have just uttered swiftly to the August Presence beneath the Golden Portal and Jade Steps of the Supreme Non-Ultimate, Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Great Dao.\n\nExiting the chamber.\nThe twenty-seventh scroll of the *Rites of the Supreme Yellow Register Retreat* concludes.\n\n**The Twenty-Eighth Scroll of the

initiated the work of primordial function, the wondrousness of the undifferentiated had already been established.\nWhen the prior earth and prior heaven were divided, the August Dao alone remained neither bright nor dim.\nIt first emerged among the multitudes of beings, thus endlessly transforming and tirelessly adapting to conditions.\nEmperors and kings revered it to attain governance; dynastic fortunes relied on it for great peace.\nBlessings return to the good; calamities and disasters naturally cease.\nWe early glimpsed the true standards and reverently received the numinous ordinances.\nWe aspire to establish meritorious deeds, aiding people and assisting the state.\nMoreover, having received the imperial decree, how dare we not make this known above?\n\n**Reading the Petition**\nAs the words of the petition state, our sincerity is earnest and our devotion profound.\nWe reverently uphold the Dharma tokens and solemnly open the altar.\nMay our transgressions be absolved; may disasters and misfortunes be dispelled.\nAs we ascend the altar to receive the Dharma and make our initial vows, may the Five Thearchs witness our covenant and the Three Officials attest to our sincerity.\nAiding the state and enacting transformation, salvation shall come first.\nThus do we dare to unfold and consult the mysterious scriptures, proclaiming the compassionate decrees.\nConducting the retreat and practicing the Dao, we emulate earth and model heaven.\nWe present the brocade of tenfold splendor; we exhaust our sincerity in prayer to the eight directions.\nHoping that through this red petition, our words may ascend to the Mysterious Void.\n\nTonight, as we conduct the evening Dao procession, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the first

sincerity, we offer our supplications to the heavens above.\nBefore the icy abyss, the multitudes stand poised;\nThrough vigilant dawn and dusk, we bring forth peace and well-being.\nAll things dissolve their afflictions and pestilence;\nThe three dawns manifest their auspicious signs.\nThe chant of the *Step of the Void* now resounds;\nWe further intone the *Profound Mystery’s* verses.\nGently unfolds the land of divine realms;\nMajestically stands the altar of myriad wonders.\nCrane-robed feathered adepts descend;\nDuck-sandaled immortals alight as celestial officials.\nJade goblets pour the primal nectar;\nJasper caskets unveil the great elixir.\nWith utmost sincerity, how shall we pray?\nMay the four seas remain forever serene.\nWater sprayed subdues the demonic palaces;\nLamps kindled illuminate the nocturnal courts.\nThe winds of the nine heavens fall silent;\nThe qi of the four extremities turns crystalline.\nWe chant and soar through the Vermilion Mound’s domain;\nWe wheel and glide above the White Jade Capital.\nWith utmost sincerity, how shall we pray?\nMay the nation’s fortune endure in eternal peace and glory.\n\n**Threefold Reverence**\nWe, your servants, prostrate with utmost devotion and bow our heads in homage to the Supreme Boundless Dao of the Great Ultimate.\nWe, your servants, prostrate with utmost devotion and bow our heads in homage to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, prostrate with utmost devotion and bow our heads in homage to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\n**Reaffirmation of Dharma Ranks**\nWe, your humble servants, [names], now reverently reaffirm our address to:\nThe Supreme Boundless Dao of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Origin,\nThe Supreme Lord of the Great Dao,\nThe Supreme Lord Lao,\nThe Perfected and Boundless Supreme Dao,\nThe Host of Sagely and Virtuous Heavenly Venerables,\nThe Celestial Emperors,\nThe Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures,\nThe Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm,\nThe High Ministers and Prime Chancellors,\nThe Four Directors and Five Emperors,\nAnd all the revered numina of the Three Realms who respond to invocation.\n\nWe, your servants, receive transformation from the Supreme Mystery,\nAnd are elevated in form within the Middle Land.\nWe revere and cultivate the supreme Dao,\nAnd partake in the study of the numinous texts.\n\nMay we conceal our traces among cliffs and peaks,\nAnd nest our spirits in the void and stillness.\nWe aspire to ascend and transcend,\nTo rise high and leave the dusty world behind.\n\nYet the Dharma permits the building of merit,\nAnd the Dao takes precedence in aiding the state.\nWe ferry beings across and relieve the suffering,\nRescuing the distressed and upholding the imperiled.\nWe propagate the Heavenly Venerable’s compassion of salvation and protection,\nAnd reveal the path for the multitudes to take refuge.\n\nIn Heaven above and Earth below,\nAll may attain what is fitting.\n\nYour disciple [name], bound by adverse fate,\nIs deeply troubled by peril and distress.\nWishing to present this petition through the proper channels,\nI hope to convey my sincere prayers.\n\nI pledge my heart with silk and brocade,\nAnd offer incense and flowers as tokens of faith.\nLooking up, I pray for the state and its people,\nExtending blessings to both the living and the departed.\n\nI repent and seek grace,\nTo dissolve calamities and invoke fortune.\n\nReflecting upon the consequences of past lives,\nAnd the transgressions accumulated over countless kalpas—\nUnawakened to the true and real,\nUnmindful of precepts and statutes,\nI have defied Heaven and violated Earth,\nPiling grave errors upon deep faults.\nIntentional killing, accidental harm,\nNew grudges and old debts,\nArising from the six senses,\nCommitted by the three karmic actions—\nBoundless and immeasurable,\nBeyond reckoning or recall.\n\nThe registers of the Nine Bureaus and Three Officials,\nThe courts of the Four Directors and Five Emperors—\nWhere sins are easily accrued,\nAnd meritorious deeds are hard to establish.\n\nThe Seven Mysteries and Nine Netherworlds bear records of scrutiny,\nWhile karmic debts from past lives carry registers of lingering misfortune.\nSome suffer calamities from celestial omens and stellar transits,\nOthers face tribulations in their fateful years and cyclical fortunes.\nThe Nine Palaces bring punishment and severance,\nThe Eight Trigrams clash and obstruct.\nThe categories of yin and yang are boundless,\nThe profound mysteries of the divine Dao are unfathomable.\nThus, disasters and faults arise,\nAnd my resolve to repent and pray is earnest.\nI array the altar and invoke the descent of true sages,\nOffering hearth incense to convey my sincerity,\nBowing in reverence and baring my heart.\nI humbly beseech the exalted saints and venerated hosts to cast their radiant gaze in mercy.\nMay the thousand disasters and myriad tribulations all be swept away.\nAbove, I pray for the eternal prosperity of the state,\nAnd the boundless virtue of the sovereign.\nMay the Five Planets follow their proper courses,\nAnd the Two Luminaries shine with doubled brilliance.\nMay the passes and cities know no toil of garrison,\nAnd the frontier fortresses be free from beacon fires of alarm.\nMay the Five Mountains and Eight Seas secure the four quarters,\nAnd the steepest peaks and deepest waters submit to the transforming influence of virtue.\nMay auspicious clouds drift in vibrant hues,\nAnd sweet dew condense in abundance.\nMay the year yield a bountiful harvest of fine grain,\nAnd felicitous omens arrive day by day.\nMay I, your disciple, along with my nine ancestral generations and seven familial lines,\nRide the grace of blessings to roam freely;\nMay my five clans and six relations\nBathe in the divine favor and enjoy peace and prosperity.\nMay the borders be tranquil,\nAnd weapons of war laid to rest.\nMay plagues and poisons vanish,\nAnd malevolent forces be eradicated.\nMay the Nine Dark Hells of the underworld\nBehold the compassionate light of the Most High;\nMay the sinful souls of the Six Realms\nReceive the beneficent power of the Heavenly Perfected.\nTogether, may they all attain deliverance\nAnd ascend to liberation.\nMay all beings—moving and still, flying and submerged—\nAttain the eternal Dao.\nAbove, may the great mercy of the Heavenly Worthy be made manifest;\nBelow, may the sincerity of this disciple and assembly in repentance be fulfilled.\nI respectfully present this petition for your hearing.\n\n**Vows**\nFirst, may the Great Dao flow freely, and all under heaven embrace virtue.\nSecond, may all sentient beings awaken to the Dao.\nThird, may the sorrowful souls of the Nine Nights attain liberation at once.\nFourth, may the orphaned and unattached spirits all receive rebirth.\nFifth, may the world know peace, and the five grains ripen in abundance.\nSixth, may ministers be loyal and children filial, rulers benevolent and fathers kind.\nSeventh, may the four seas unite in harmony, and enmity and kinship be reconciled.\nEighth, may those concealed in wombs or encased in eggs all attain birth and growth.\nNinth, may chronic and recent ailments swiftly be healed.\nTenth, may the destitute and orphaned enjoy ample clothing and food.\n\n**Replenishing the Incense Burner**\nIncense Official Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Attendant Incense Spirits—\nAt this place where I offer incense,\nMay golden elixir, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms naturally arise.\nMay the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones\nGather here before the incense burner.\nMay I, in seeking the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality.\nMay the patron of this retreat receive blessings,\nAnd both the living and the departed partake in grace.\nMay the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions,\nAttending the orchid-scented smoke,\nConvey my earlier petition\nAnd swiftly deliver it to the Celestial Throne of the Most High, Boundless, Formless, Nameless,\nVacuous, and Spontaneous Great Dao.\n\n**Exiting the Chamber**\nHere concludes the twenty-eighth scroll of the *Rites of the Yellow Register Retreat of the Most High*.\n\n**Scroll Twenty-Nine of the *Rites of the Yellow Register Retreat*\nRevised by Tang Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting\nMorning Dao-Observance for Repentance and Disease-Averting**\n\n**Entering the Chamber**\nEach bows to the master, visualizing as prescribed.\n\n**Guardian Spirits**\nGolden perfected ones and verdant mists\nRadiate through the Three Heavens.\nCrimson clouds traverse the cinnabar skies,\nWhile the host of heavens reins in their chariots.\nDawn’s splendor dispels the gloom,\nAnd shadows vanish at morning’s glow.\nThe Ninefold Subtleties shake the void,\nAs the Five Stars wheel in their courses.\nMyriad immortals respond to the resonance,\nIn the mystery of spontaneity.\nFrom the fathomless depths, light scatters,\nAnd forms divide into billions.\nJeweled pearls gleam with brilliance,\nAuspicious signs descend upon the altar’s domain.\nThe living and the dead receive grace,\nBathed in the refining springs of gold.\nDemon kings tremble in fear,\nAs the Three Fields merge with the luminous.\n\n**Strike the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**\nO Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three *Qi* of the Supreme Dao Lord,\nSummon forth from within this servant’s body:\nThe Three and Five Merit Officers,\nLeft and right attendant messengers,\nIncense-bearing golden youths,\nMessage-conveying jade maidens,\nFive Emperors’ direct talismans,\nAnd incense officials of the day—\nEach in thirty-two ranks, now emerge.\nAs they depart, arrayed in solemn vestments,\nThey unlock the gates of the numinous altar,\nInvoking the celestial deities and earthly gods of this land and domain.\n\nThis servant now humbly petitions:\nMay the wondrous light of the Jade Clarity Dao *qi* and Numinous Treasure\nDescend and flow into our bodies,\nThat the words we now utter\nBe swiftly conveyed to the Celestial Throne of the Most High, Boundless, Formless, Nameless,\nVacuous, and Spontaneous Great Dao.\n\n**Each States Their Dharma Rank**\nWe, your humble servants, together in sincerity, reverently address\nThe Vacuous and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy,\nThe Boundless Great Dao,

Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm,\nAnd all the divine officials of the Three Realms.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves, having heard:\nThe movements of *qi* and celestial signs,\nThe manifest and hidden workings of yin and yang.\nRise and fall follow the cycles of fortune,\nWhile waxing and waning mark the thresholds of blessing and calamity.\nHow much more so in this dusty world,\nWhere none escape the crucible of fate?\nYet the Three Worthies expound the teachings,\nBestowing the ordinances to save the living and deliver the dead;\nThe myriad sages extend their compassion,\nRevealing the methods to rescue beings and succor the imperiled.\nTheir divine transformations widely spread,\nSheltering all living things.\nWe, having trodden the gateway of the Dharma,\nHave early received the merciful instructions.\nThus, we ought to avert disasters and extricate hardships,\nPraying for blessings upon the people.\nTo propagate the teachings and establish merit,\nThereby manifesting the profound mysteries.\nNow, in obedience to the edict,\nHow dare we not make this known above?\n\n**Reading the Petition**\nAs the words declare, our sincerity is urgent.\nMay the great protection be extended,\nThat our devout prayers be conveyed.\n\nThe retreat’s patron, [Name],\nHas been stained by the six dusts,\nMolded by the four great elements.\nWater and fire vary in their abundance,\nWhile darkness and light differ in their joy and sorrow.\nAt times, harmony is disrupted,\nSuddenly giving rise to illness and misfortune.\nBody and spirit race in panic,\nLife and destiny hang in peril.\nOnly by knocking upon the gates of the true and numinous\nMay deliverance be hoped for.\n\nWe, your servants, reverently follow the ritual codes,\nArranging the altar’s precincts.\nWe bow our heads to implore grace,\nGazing heavenward to beseech the mandate.\nAt this early morning observance,\nWe, the assembled Dharma practitioners,\nNow offer the first pinch of incense.\nMay this incense smoke ascend to the heavens,\nDirectly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives,\nProstrating ourselves to the ground,\nRelying upon the

dragon’s charts\nEndure with heaven and earth;\nMay the imperial virtue and sagely influence\nShine as long as the sun and moon.\nMay wisdom illuminate the ten thousand directions,\nAnd benevolence extend to the eight extremities.\nMay the heir apparent, the empress, and the consorts,\nAlong with the ministers within and without,\nTogether foster harmony and prosperity,\nBringing peace to the realm.\nWithin the eight limits of the world,\nMay rulers, ministers, officials, and people\nAll be overspread by boundless blessings,\nAnd the whole earth bask in radiant peace.\n\nNow therefore we kindle incense,\nTaking refuge in the Perfected Virtue of the Great Sage Masters and the Host of the Most Real,\nWho, having attained the Dao,\nAscend into the Formless.\nHarmony unites with the True Dao.\n\nOn this morning audience in the Dao,\nWe, the ritual assembly, offer this second pinch of incense.\nMay its fragrant smoke ascend through the heavens,\nDirectly to present offerings to the

virtues\nFlow to the patron of this retreat, the household of so-and-so.\nMay the nine generations and seven lineages,\nThe hundred thousand myriad ancestors,\nKin and affinal relations,\nAnd the departed spirits of the departed,\nBy the mysterious power of the Yellow Register,\nAscend to the Vermilion Mound’s immortal realm.\nMay their yang radiance refine their forms,\nAs fire tempers essence.\nMay their names be stricken from the Black Ledger,\nAnd their registers inscribed in the Azure Palace.\nIn the carefree realm of the Real,\nMay they forever cast off the calamities of lingering afflictions;\nMay those yet living receive blessings,\nAnd enjoy the fortune of peace and integrity.\n\nNow therefore we kindle incense,\nTaking refuge in the Perfected Virtue of the Great Sage Masters and the Host of the Most Real,\nWho, having attained the Dao,\nAscend into the Formless.\nHarmony unites with the True Dao.\n\nOn this morning audience in the Dao,\nWe, the ritual assembly, offer this third pinch of incense.\nMay its fragrant smoke ascend through the heavens,\nDirectly to present offerings to the Most High and Perfect Masterly Treasure.\nWe prostrate ourselves,

clinging to his person be dispelled,\nAnd his misfortunes be stilled.\nMay illness and infirmity be healed,\nAnd enmities be reconciled.\nMay the Lord of Life of Southern Prosperity\nOpen the Register of Life to prolong his years;\nMay the Imperial Lord of the Northern Office\nErase his name from the Black Book of Death.\nMay his hun-soul and shen-spirit be purified and rectified,\nAnd his myriad qi endure forever.\nMay his kin and affinal relations\nTogether partake in this sublime blessing.\nWhether soaring or sinking, of different natures or forms,\nMay all moving creatures\nBathe in this mysterious grace,\nAnd together attain integrity and felicity.\n\nNow therefore we kindle incense,\nTaking refuge in the Perfected Virtue of the Great Sage Masters and the Host of the Most Real,\nWho, having attained the Dao,\nAscend into the Formless.\nHarmony unites with the True Dao.\n\nThe rites are complete;\nWe repent our transgressions.\n\nEach visualizes the nine-hued spherical image, swallows saliva, and recites the secret incantation to command demons—thrice intoned:\n\n*\"I take the Dharma as my wife,\nCherish the sutras as pearls and jade.\nHolding precepts to restrain the six senses,\nMindful of the Dao to dispel desires.\nIn purity, the true qi settles;\nIn serenity, the spirit grows still.\nHeavenly demons all revere and protect—\nLifetimes of boundless fortune unfold.\nProsperous are the households and states,\nFlourishing the scriptures and the Dao.\nHeaven and humankind share this vow,\nEthereally entering the Great Vehicle.\nBy the heart’s resolve, the field of merit is sown;\nThe Dharma-wheel ascends in endless motion.\nSeven generations ascend to celestial halls,\nWhile this body soars in broad daylight.\nThe Great Dao pervades the mysterious void—\nWith thought, nothing fails to align.\nRefining the form to join the immortals,\nThus attaining the vajra-body.\nTranscending the three realms’ tribulations,\nThe five hells’ sufferings are dissolved.\nAll return to the Most High’s sutras—\nIn stillness, we bow in reverence.\"*\n\nThrice we bow:\nWe, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao.\nWe, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\nReaffirming the Dharma ranks:\nWe, your humble servants, [Names] and others, with unified devotion, reverently address the Most High, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Origin; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Boundless Great Dao and Virtue’s host of sages across the ten directions; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; and all the true numina of the three realms’ official retinues.\n\nHaving received the mystic ordinances and reverently upheld the compassionate teachings, we aid the times and assist the state, propagating the Dao to pacify the people.\n\nYet our traces mingle with the marketplace and court, our merits as light as dust and dew. Ever deepening our vigilance and fear, we dare not rest in ease. Yet the Dharma demands propagation, and duty calls first to deliverance and salvation.\n\nNow the patron of this retreat, [Name], pressed by calamitous celestial omens and assailed by illness and distress, grieves as if life were a flickering candle, his very existence imperiled. Today, he lays bare his heart to plead for life, prostrating at the gate of the Dharma. We, your servants, accordingly follow the luminous ordinances, conducting this retreat and performing the Dao. We inscribe the petitions, enumerate the transgressions, and offer repentance for both the living and the dead.\n\nWe fear that through nine generations, karmic misfortunes have flowed and accumulated; that in past lives and former ages, grievances have knotted and congealed. Perhaps in resolve or thought, he has transgressed against hidden virtue; or in emotion or intent, failed to align with the numinous. Past faults and former errors, hidden sins and manifest transgressions—all these causes and conditions, layer upon layer, have woven this disaster and peril.\n\nWe further fear that in the three destinies and five phases, the nine palaces and eight trigrams, the celestial patterns and stellar constellations, the revolutions of fate and the cycles of years, baleful influences have descended, and stars have cast their baleful light. Perhaps his life’s allotment is meager, his fortune weak; or he has incurred old slayings, unintended harms, new grievances, or past debts. Or perhaps the qi of the five pestilences and hundred poisons, or the followers of malevolent spirits and demonic attachments, have assailed him—externally penetrating his skin and flesh, internally invading his viscera and bowels—giving rise to this grave illness, which has yet to be cured or dispelled.\n\nWe humbly beseech the Most High to bestow mercy, and the Three Luminaries to absolve his sins. May all karmic enmities be dissolved, all disasters and misfortunes harmonized and released. For sins without limit across past lives and this present existence, we now offer repentance and supplication, praying that all be forgiven and erased. May his true qi flow freely, his numinous fluids spread and moisten. May the hundred afflictions be purged, the six palaces attain peace. May his allotted blessings increase in abundance, his years extend in longevity. May his entire household enjoy fortune, and both inner and outer realms be graced with prosperity.\n\nAbove, we pray for the tranquility of the altars of soil and grain, and the eternal life of the emperor. May wind and rain be timely and harmonious, the years abundant, and the times prosperous. May all sentient beings with consciousness ascend to the realm of longevity.\n\nMay the great compassion of the Most High Heavenly Venerable shine above, and may our sincerity in prayer and repentance be met below. We reverently present this petition for your hearing.\n\n**Invocation of Intentions**\n\nFirst intention: For the Dao, the four great elements unite in virtue. May the patron’s seven generations of parents be freed from sorrow and suffering, ascend to the heavenly halls, and enjoy sustenance as natural as the Dao itself.\n\nSecond intention: For the emperor and sovereign, may the transformative power of the Dao flourish and prosper. May the schools and academies thrive, the imperial teachings expand in grandeur. May their majesty and dignity be revered by all under heaven. May the people praise the era as one of great peace, and the four barbarians submit in awe. May evil and malevolence vanish of their own accord, and worthy individuals arise daily.\n\nThird intention: For the Dharma Master, may great merit and virtue be established. May their teachings be luminous and far-reaching, and may they together attain the flight of immortals.\n\nFourth intention: For fellow aspirants and disciples, may they swiftly attain the Dao of immortality and mutually guide one another to liberation.\n\nFifth intention: For the nine relations, may harmony prevail. May they esteem benevolence and righteousness, honor the Dao and disdain wealth, and serve as models for all beings.\n\nSixth intention: For selfless giving, may offerings be made to Daoist masters and those who suffer from hunger and cold. May all people under heaven find their rightful place.\n\nSeventh intention: For all creatures that creep and crawl, may every sentient being attain fulfillment and completion.\n\nEighth intention: For the absolution of past lives’ sins and present-life karmic retributions, may merits be established to redress transgressions.\n\nNinth intention: For the prosperity of family and state, may ancestral temples be tended by worthy descendants, and generations give rise to sages and talents.\n\nTenth intention: For reverence toward the master and scriptures, may we never falter in diligence, maintaining a mind of equanimity. May all beings be broadly delivered, and may we together attain the rank of immortals, ascending to heaven in broad daylight to pay homage to the Most High. May we forever become perfected beings, riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages, harmonizing with the Dao to become true. **The incense burner is sealed.**\n\nTo the Incense Official Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attending Incense Spirits: May the place where this incense is offered naturally give rise to golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected beings gather here before the incense burner. May this disciple study the Dao and attain the Dao, seek immortality and attain immortality. May the patron receive blessings, and may both the hidden and manifest realms be graced with favor.\n\nMay the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions, who attend the orchid-scented smoke, swiftly convey the words just uttered to the August Jade Sovereign of the Golden Portal of the Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Supreme Dao of Boundless Vastness.\n\n*Exiting the chamber*\n**End of the Twenty-Ninth Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Retreat Rites**\n**Beginning of the Thirtieth Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Retreat Rites**\n*Compiled by Tang Dynasty Master of Broad Achievement, Du Guangting*\n\n*Entering the chamber*\nEach pays homage to the master, contemplating as prescribed.\n\n**Guardian of the Numinous**\nChanting the empty and cavernous, the Lord of the Altar stands guard.\nThe Five Emperors review records, receiving talismans from the Three Officials.\nThe four gates are secured, binding demons and expelling treachery.\nFlaming bells are cast, impurities burned, and remnants purged.\nThe body bears the golden script, refining the elixir and rejuvenating the countenance.\nMerging with the mysterious and plain, the heart stirs the three barriers.\nRiding lions and cranes, mounting dragons and phoenixes.\nThe stars guard their stations, a thousand demons dare not intrude.\nThe Dao and qi endure, the myriad immortals rest in peace.\n\n**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**\nO Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Three Qi of the Mysterious Origin, Supreme Dao Lord: Summon forth from within this disciple’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attending Messengers, the Golden Youths of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Thirty-Two Incense Officials of the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans and Daily Spirits. Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn attire, to report to the Divine Lords of the Mysterious Altar and the Heavenly Emperor. Let them now invoke the local earth deities and true officials of this domain.\n\nThis disciple now offers prayers with utmost sincerity: May the wondrous light of the Jade Clarity’s Dao qi and Numinous Treasure descend and flow into our bodies. May the altar within and without be purified and made true. May the heavens be free of defilement, the earth cleansed of demonic dust. May the jade chimes resound, the ten directions be solemn and clear. May the myriad demons not intrude, and may true sincerity ascend. May the words just uttered swiftly reach the August Jade Sovereign of the Golden Portal of the Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Supreme Dao of Boundless Vastness.\n\n**Each declares their dharma rank**\nWe, your humble disciples of such-and-such rank, together with utmost sincerity, reverently address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous Origin, the Supreme Jade Dawn Lord of the Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of the August Heaven, the great sage hosts and perfected lords of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors, the Jade Clarity Emperor, the Great Emperor of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Flower, Southern Ultimate, Western Numinous, and Northern True Lords of the Mysterious Capital, the Golden Portal, the Seven-Jewel Mysterious Terrace, the Purple Tenuity Supreme Palace, the Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, and all responsive and perceptive numinous beings of the three realms.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves, having heard that the wondrous and marvelous origin, vast and transformative, preceded the emperors; the supreme and ultimate honored one, whose mysterious merit extends beyond all things. Though yin and yang rise and fall, and kalpas begin and end, it remains serene and constant, majestic and self-sustaining. Thus, the three thousand luminous realms all submit to its divine grace; the five hundred million celestial gates together attain its Dao transformation.\n\nAs fortune and misfortune alternate, and blessings and calamities shift, all may be dispelled by its sagely power, washed clean by its numinous grace. It rescues the imperiled, saves all beings, assists the state, and transforms the people. For ten thousand ages, it has been revered, its responses unfailing.\n\nNow, bearing our petitions and presenting our pleas, we humbly seek its favor. Whatever we pray for, by principle, should be reported. Having received these words, how dare we not make them known above?\n\n**Reading the Petition**\nIn accordance with the sincerity of these words, deeply do we knock and pray. Disciple So-and-so, afflicted by the interplay of yin and yang, harmed by cold and heat, bows in reverence, baring his heart, earnestly seeking protection.\n\nWe, your disciples, reflect that the Heavenly Worthy, ever compassionate, constantly saves all beings. Raising the Dharma raft to ferry across the sea of delusion, suspending the jewel to gather all beings. Proclaiming the precepts and expounding the teachings, warding off distress and aiding the imperiled.\n\nThus, we purify our thoughts and cleanse our hearts, performing the retreat and practicing the Dao. We pray that your sagely power may dispel calamities and obscurations.\n\nToday, at the noon audience, we conduct the Dao ritual. The Dharma assembly now offers the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most High and Perfected Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, reverently relying upon the Three Honored Ones of the Most High. May these merits flow to the august spirits of the altars and ancestors, to the former sages of our lineage. May they ascend to the eight luminous realms, merge with the nine purities. Gazing upon the great void, may they bestow blessings upon the great enterprise.\n\nMay the emperor embody the virtue of Yao, establishing the ultimate, succeeding Yu and inheriting the mandate. May he illumine the golden mirror in the purple court, turning the jade balance in the azure heavens. May the star of longevity shine ever brighter, the mountain of fortune grow ever loftier. May the empress and consorts assist in transforming the six palaces, and the ministers and aides secure the myriad domains. May radiance spread through the realm of the Dao, and harmony be perfectly achieved through non-action.\n\nFor this, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely hosts and perfected virtues of our masters. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into non-action, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\nToday, at the noon audience, we conduct the Dao ritual. The Dharma assembly now offers the second pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most High and Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, reverently relying upon the Three Honored Ones of the Most High. May these merits flow to the household of disciple So-and-so. May the nine generations and seven lineages, the myriad ancestors and hundredfold forebears, depart from the courts of the dark netherworld, leave the courts of eternal night. May their karmic nets be dissolved, their blessings and auspices gather abundantly. Even those in the springs’ sealed chambers and the flying and moving beings of other realms—may all receive the blessings of good fortune and be universally delivered.\n\nFor this, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely hosts and perfected virtues of our masters. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into non-action. We harmonize with the Dao to become true.\n\nToday, at the noon audience, we conduct the Dao ritual. The Dharma assembly now offers the third pinch of incense.\n\nMay this incense smoke ascend through the void, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Master-Treasures. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves with heads to the earth, reverently relying on the Three Supreme Ones. May these merits and virtues flow to the disciple So-and-so’s person. May calamities be washed away, and misfortunes be dissolved. Past grievances and old debts, through repentance and prayer, be wholly eradicated; deep-seated transgressions and hidden blemishes, through the fragrance of cultivation, be purified. May malevolent forces be stilled, and years of fortune be prolonged.\n\nFor this, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely hosts and perfected virtues of our masters. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into non-action. We harmonize with the Dao to become true.\n\nWe bow in ritual, repent, and reflect. Envisioning the nine-colored perfect image, we swallow saliva and recite the secret incantation against demons. Stepping in emptiness, we circumambulate:\n\nThe azure canopy of Primordial Qi unfurls,\nGolden incense forms pearl-like smoke.\nThe flying dawn gathers reins as one,\nBowing before the Jade Emperor’s presence.\nHis heart vast and at ease, he bestows upon us the *Tai Ling Pian*.\nThis is the indestructible Dao,\nBy which the myriad heavens uphold our authority.\nWe traverse the hollow void,\nWhile lower immortals grope in its depths.\nThe One Qi transforms the primordial origin,\nVastly preceding the Two Modes.\nPrecious ramparts race golden steeds,\nTrue incense sprays from jade lotuses.\nSoaring through space, we rein in dragon steeds,\nWhile Brahmanic chants guide the divine chariot.\nThrough endless kalpas of eternal spring,\nWe soar in the formless heavens.\nThe mysteries of the Initial Perfected are hard to fathom,\nThus we admonish the immortals within the precepts.\nThe exalted Perfected illuminate virtue and the Dao,\nBequeathing to the world the *Five Thousand Words*.\nThough our explanations are meager and shallow,\nWe exhaust our sincerity to fathom the wondrous origin.\nRainbow banners adorn the sacred canons,\nFeathered hymns resound through cloud-borne chariots.\nAuspicious cranes hover in the sky,\nPropitious winds dispel summer’s heat.\nThe vault of heaven responds to these sounds,\nBestowing a reign of countless years.\n\nWe perform the Three Bows:\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\nReaffirming our ranks, we, the humble disciples So-and-so, respectfully re-present our supplication to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Commencement; the Supreme Great Dao Lord; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; the High Ministers and Prime Aides; the Four Directors and Five Emperors; the Right and Left Perfected Ones of the Orthodox Unity; the Supreme Perfected Purple Void Primordial Lady of the Southern Peak; and all the divine officials and hosts of the Three Realms.\n\nWe humbly recall: when the Heavenly Origin established the supreme pole and the Earthly Principle marked the pivot, riding the wondrous Dao to differentiate forms and fixing the Two Modes to set forth images, their vast embrace knew no bounds, their sheltering power was inexhaustible. Yet the cycles of nine and six bring changes of ascent and descent; the alternations of decline and prosperity mark the passage of kalpas. How much more so for human kind—how could they be free from decline and decay?\n\nDisciple So-and-so, dwelling in the worldly net and stained by the dusty realm, is constrained by qi and phenomena, struck by fortune and misfortune. Thus, he is entangled in illness and misfortune, ever more deeply beset by worry and peril. We fear that in past lives and this existence, karmic blemishes remain unwashed, old grievances and accumulated transgressions, debts and disputes, are yet unresolved. Perhaps through intentional killing or accidental harm, he has incurred misfortune and blame. Or through the stars and his natal destiny, he has suffered evil and calamity. His form and fate are humble and fragile—there is nowhere to turn for repentance and prayer.\n\nTherefore, we lay bare our hearts to the Great Dao, prostrating ourselves before the Mystic Code. We establish the altar and humbly offer repentance and gratitude. Following the rank and protocol of the Heavenly Master, we initiate the first ritual document. In accordance with the Purple Void Primordial Lady’s method of repentance for calamities, we now petition on behalf of So-and-so:\n\nWe summon the Heavenly Prosperity Lord and one hundred thousand Yellow-Clad Soldiers to gather and remove all inauspicious influences, the twelve criminal and deadly qi, from within and without the disciple’s household.\n\nWe further summon the Southern Palace Heavenly Bright Lord and the Northern Star Six Mechanisms Lord to collect the five pestilences, hundred poisons, and hundred illnesses.\n\nWe summon the Feng-Li Lord and the Red Plain Lord to eliminate the disciple’s ailments of the heart, abdomen, and urinary obstructions.\n\nWe summon the Heavenly Official Five Balances Lord, the Earthly Official Five Balances Lord, the Nine Rivers Northern Sea Lord, the Kingly Law Lord, the Nine Assemblies Lord, the Great Official Yang Order Lord, the Southern Superior Lord, the Momentary Lord, and the Stone Immortal Lord to expel all inner and outer demonic afflictions causing illness.\n\nWe summon the Heaven-Covering Great General and the Upper Prime Officer Lord to capture and subdue all malevolent deceased spirits, averting misfortune and inviting blessings.\n\nWe summon the Earth-Restraining Lord and the Four Hu Lords to dispel the calamities of the disciple’s current year and natal destiny, severing the qi of deceased spirits’ influences.\n\nWe summon the Qi-Moving Calamity-Dissolving Lord, the Supreme High Granary Lord, the Supreme Heavenly Lord, and the Level Heaven Lord to dissolve and remove the ghosts of death, mourning, punishment, harm, and the five graves.\n\nWe summon the Numinous Plain Heavenly Essence Lord, the Red Heaven Qi-Consuming Lord, and the Spirit-Gathering Upper Bright Lord to sever the disciple’s nightmares, malevolent ghosts, and the qi of lingering illnesses.\n\nMay the twenty-four divisions of heavenly officials and soldiers descend in timely fashion to punish evil, extinguish malevolence, and subdue inauspicious influences. May true qi secretly aid him, granting peace and well-being. May his dreams and waking be upright, his lifespan prolonged. May his nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and his six relations receive blessings. May dragon spirits guard and protect him, his dwelling secure and tranquil.\n\nAbove, we pray that the imperial Dao shines resplendently, the Heavenly Origin be bright and serene. May weapons of war be forever stilled, wind and rain arrive in due season. May grain and crops be abundant, the hidden and manifest realms harmonious. May all beings be universally included, even those in the darkest chambers. May all together bathe in the profound grace and together attain the realm of blessings. May the luminous Heavenly Worthy’s vast compassion respond to our humble repentance and supplication.\n\nWe respectfully present this entreaty.\n\nWe now make our vows:\n\nFirst, may the Great Dao be serene and empty, tranquil and still, dwelling in clarity and purity. May it widely open the gates of the Dharma, instructing the stubborn and foolish. May all receive its beneficent grace and cultivate with diligence. May we, together with our fellow students, universally ascend to the void, preserving our union with heaven, abiding forever without care.\n\nSecond, may the myriad heavens condense their qi and become clear. May the high void broadly shelter, preserving the true and securing the numinous. May the climate be harmonious, the four seasons balanced. May the nation be secure, the people prosperous, and all under heaven be at peace. May all beings be universally aided, and its beneficence extend to all life. May the heavens be preserved for countless kalpas, never to collapse.\n\nThird, may the earth bear and sustain without end.\n\nMay the earth remain stable and unshaken, the seas calm and uncollapsed. May it safeguard and secure the state and family, and the myriad people flourish in harmony. May it nurture life and grant peaceful death, its beneficence extending to the ten directions. May crops and grains flourish, and daily sustenance abound. May all receive its abundant support, and the myriad beings follow in accord.\n\nFourth, may the sun and moon, the two luminaries, stand high and bright. May they know no sudden eclipses, their waxing and waning serene and clear. May their light illumine all heavens, dissolving the deepest darkness. May they preserve the kalpas’ course, and the world’s destiny be at peace. May their moistening grace universally extend, showering blessings upon all beings.\n\nFifth, may the stars and constellations shine with the same radiance as the sun. May their revolving brilliance illuminate, casting clear light in the ten directions. May each abide in its proper place, their paths straight and true. May they safeguard and secure the state and family, sparing them from harm and disaster. May the four seas be at peace as one, and all under heaven flourish.\n\nSixth, may the four seasons follow their appointed cycles. May their climates be harmonious and balanced, free from calamity and misfortune. May pestilence and plague be eradicated, and all under heaven dwell in peace. May the five grains ripen in abundance, the nation prosper, and the people rejoice.\n\nSeventh, may floating clouds condense their qi and gather their mists. May they soar high and clear in the heavens, casting their shadow over the profound and mysterious. When concealed, they act without contrivance; when dispersed, they fill the sky. May immortals and transcendents dwell together, befriending the host of perfected beings. May their beneficence flow to all, fostering the nation and cherishing the people. May they universally aid all beings, and humanity endure as long as the kalpas.\n\nEighth, may wind and rain flow and shower without end. May they universally bestow their bounty, nurturing growth and flourishing. May the myriad things thrive, the nation’s stores be full, and the people abundant.\n\nNinth, may the Five Peaks each abide in their proper place. May they tower majestically, ever serving as immortal palaces. May they secure the nation’s destiny, preserving heaven without end. May they protect and deliver all beings, none who do not look to them in reverence.\n\nTenth, may the rivers and seas stretch boundlessly. May they contain and embrace all with vastness, nurturing even the smallest of things. May their depths be profound and their kindness gentle, moistening all that wriggles and breathes. May heaven and humanity receive blessings, their years enduring like the kalpas’ stone.\n\nEleventh, may the emperor and the kingdom prosper day by day. May the four frontiers be at peace, and weapons of war not be raised. May heaven and humanity sing in praise, and auspicious omens come soaring. May teachings be widely spread, and virtuous transformation overflow. May the myriad people rejoice, and boundless joy never end.\n\nTwelfth, may all creatures—those that fly, crawl, and move, whether born or yet unborn—universally receive safety. May all attain life and growth. May they all behold the primordial qi and receive the form of yang. May grasses, trees, fruits, and forests endure winter without withering. May all be delivered and aided, none that do not flourish in fresh splendor. May harmony unite with the Dao and merge with the true. The furnace is restored.\n\nMay the Fragrant Official Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all spirit-officials attendant upon the incense ensure that where I offer this fragrance, golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms naturally arise. May the hundred numinous perfected ones gather here before the incense burner. May I, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality. May the patron of this retreat receive blessings, and may the living and the departed alike be touched by grace.\n\nMay the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the orchid-scented smoke, swiftly conveying my supplications directly to the Throne of the Supreme Non-Ultimate Dao—formless, nameless, empty, and spontaneous—in the Golden Palace of Jade. The door is opened.\n\n*End of the Thirty-First Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Retreat Rites*\n\n*The Thirty-Second Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Retreat Rites*\n*Edited by Tang Dynasty Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting*\n\n*Repentance and Exorcism for Illness, Circumambulation at Dusk*\n\nThe door is entered. Each pays homage to the master and contemplates as prescribed.\n\nThe radiance of the guardian spirits shines brightly, auspicious qi swirls in coils. The Dipper and the Ladle gleam with pure light, the halls of mushrooms stand serene. Jade pupils and golden perfected ones, the precious altar is wholly yang. Night is transformed into day, the hour is turned back to before noon. Mount Taihua streams with color, the cinnabar phoenix soars upon the axle. Demons are stilled, treachery is extinguished, one strides high through the mist of blessings. Heavenly perfected ones gather together, all arriving before the Emperor. The dharma drum is sounded twenty-four times.\n\nThe Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, First Three Qi, Supreme Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendants of the Left and Right, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-two of each—let them emerge. As they emerge, let them solemnly prepare and open the gates of the Mysterious Altar to the Heavenly Thearch and Divine Lords, and summon the local earth gods and territorial true officials. This servant now, acting on behalf of the intent herein, prays that the wondrous light of the Jade Purity Dao Qi and Numinous Treasure may descend and flow into the bodies of this servant and company, thereby rendering the Mysterious Altar pure and transforming both inner and outer into truth. Let the heavens be free of defilement, the earth purged of demonic dust. Let the chiming of jade resound, the ten directions grow solemn and clear. Let the myriad demons not intrude, true sincerity ascend above. May the words this servant utters swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme, Boundless, Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Golden Gate Jade Steps of the Great Dao.\n\nEach declares their dharma rank:\nIn reverent unity, we, your servants, humbly address the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Boundless Great Dao Supreme Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Jade Thearch of the August Heaven, the Great Sage Hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Void Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Gate, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity, Upper Palace, Numinous Treasure, Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, and all the true numina of the Three Realms.\n\nWe, your servants, have heard that the undifferentiated gives rise to form, the True One congeals into light. Heaven and earth rely upon it for their inception, yin and yang operate through it for generation and transformation. Flourishing and decline alternate, good and evil intertwine. The sun and moon have their times of waning and decline, cold and heat have their cycles of advance and retreat. Only this Great Dao pervades the hidden and manifest. It extends blessings and bestows grace, broadly aiding all existence. We, your servants, early explored the true instructions and obtained a glimpse of the numinous charts. The Three Caverns’ jade cases contain rites of prayer and exorcism; the Nine Heavens’ golden tablets transmit texts of salvation and protection. For forty thousand kalpas they have been expounded, by five hundred million heavens they are revered. They subdue demonic evil and summon demonic spirits. They assist the state in establishing merit, deliver beings and save things. When there is something to be prayed for, how dare we not make it known above?\n\nRecitation of the Petition:\nFollowing the words of the petition, we are truly sincere and earnest. Disciple So-and-so, with disasters yet unceased and illnesses yet unalleviated, surrenders his life to the various heavens and lays bare his heart to the Great Dao. He requests to perform the fast and vigil, to invite the descent of numinous power. Thus, with cinnabar sincerity, he together hopes for mysterious protection. Tonight, during the evening audience and circumambulation, the Dharma assembly is entreated to offer the first pinch of incense. May the smoke of this incense ascend directly to offer reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe, your servants, surrender our bodies and lives, prostrate ourselves, and look up in reliance upon the Three Worthies of the Supreme. May the merit of this act flow to the Emperor and the august personages of the nine ancestral temples. May they ascend in splendor to the Three Purities, bestowing auspiciousness upon the myriad states. May the great foundation be firmly established, the phoenix calendar eternally flourishing. May the Crown Prince and various princes steadfastly support the great enterprise. May the empresses, consorts, and all officials assist in the sagely plans. May the tracks of carts be as one, the ladders and ships all gather. For this reason, we now burn incense and personally take refuge in the Great Sage Hosts, the Perfected and Virtuous Ones. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into non-action, harmonizing and uniting with the Dao as truth.\n\nTonight, during the evening audience and circumambulation, the Dharma assembly is entreated to offer the second pinch of incense. May the smoke of this incense ascend directly to offer reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.\n\nWe, your servants, surrender our bodies and lives, prostrate ourselves, and look up in reliance upon the Three Worthies of the Supreme. May the merit of this act flow to the patron of this fast, the household of So-and-so. May the nine ancestors and seven generations, the obscured and lingering spirits, transcend the earthly dust and ascend to the celestial thoroughfares. May litigation be stilled at the gates of darkness, blessings and auspiciousness flow to future descendants. May the Nine Yous and earthly prisons all behold the light of compassion. May the beings of the six destinies together ascend to the realm of goodness. For this reason, we now burn incense and personally take refuge in the Great Sage Hosts, the Perfected and Virtuous Ones. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into non-action, harmonizing and uniting with the Dao as truth.\n\nTonight, during the evening audience and circumambulation, the Dharma assembly is entreated to offer the third pinch of incense. May the smoke of this incense ascend directly to offer reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters.\n\nWe, your servants, surrender our bodies and lives, prostrate ourselves, and look up in reliance upon the Three Worthies of the Supreme. May the merit of this act flow to disciple So-and-so’s person. May karmic debts be pacified, disasters and calamities dissolved. May inauspicious declines melt like ice, illnesses and misfortunes disperse like clouds. May the Southern Dipper extend life, the Eastern Palace register blessings. May all kin and dependents, universally including humans and heavens, together enjoy the good merit and all attain the realm of the Dao.\n\nNow, therefore, we kindle incense and surrender ourselves in refuge to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters, whose virtue is most true. Having attained the Dao, they ascend into the realm of non-action, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the Real.\n\nWe bow in the four directions, repent, and pace the void. As we circumambulate, our steps trace the celestial net; the heavenly winds blow swiftly upon us. Our fluttering robes rise to the handle of the Dipper, while we hold the fly-whisk and bow to the Banner of the Three Stars. Lions bear vermilion tassels, and qilins lead jade-green chariots. Flying through the eight extremities, how often have we seen the spring branches burst forth? Verdant temples crown crimson headbands, and azure mists entwine our feathered robes. At dawn we hasten to the Hall of Solar Virtue; by night we arrive at the Gate of Lunar Splendor. We strike and play with the fires of the celestial sphere, and the soaking rains awaken the earth’s mechanisms. The Jade Chamber cannot retain us—we soar instead toward the ninefold heavens.\n\nOnce, in the Hall of Extended Grace, at midnight, the Nine August Ones descended. The Six Perfected divided left and right, while yellow mists coiled around the balustrades. Within the vast palace, the divine lords were revered, and celestial soldiers guarded the Dao sanctuary. Today, as filial descendants, we continue this resolve, standing but a foot’s span from the numinous radiance.\n\nWith threefold prostration, we, your servants, bow our heads in utmost sincerity to the Supreme, Boundless Dao of the Great Ultimate.\nWe, your servants, bow our heads in utmost sincerity to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, bow our heads in utmost sincerity to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\nReverently addressing the ranks of the Dharma, we, your servants, So-and-so and others, humbly reaffirm our supplication to the Supreme, Boundless Dao of the Great Ultimate, the Primordial Celestial Venerable of the Origin; the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Venerable Perfected of the Ten Directions’ Boundless Dao and Virtue; the Celestial Thearchs and Great Emperors; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; the High Ministers and Prime Ministers; the Four Directors and Five Emperors; and all the divine officials and numinous spirits of the Three Realms.\n\nWe bear the precious script upon our persons, ever ashamed of the divine grace bestowed. Privately delving into the profound mysteries, our aspiration lies in spreading the light of yang. We seek to establish merit through transformation, broadly benefiting all beings. Disciple So-and-so, beset by inauspicious fate and afflicted by illness, presents this petition with utmost sincerity, praying for blessings. We request the elevation of this fast and the invocation of the true numina. Thus, we respectfully follow the canonical rites, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao.\n\nFirst, we repent for disciple So-and-so’s transgressions, both past and present, which are deep and grievous. Some offend the benevolence of heaven and earth’s nurturing embrace; others betray the virtue of the sun and moon’s illumination. We have violated the nature of the two qi and five phases, harmed the harmony of the three luminaries and six regulations. Unresolved karmic debts from the past compound with newly accrued sins. We have caused harm through error and killing, indulging our wills and following our hearts. Ignorant of causes and conditions, heedless of prohibitions and taboos, moved by the six emotions, and acting through the three karmas, we have transgressed against the unseen and the manifest, contravened the teachings of the scriptures. Thus, we incur these retributions and construct these calamities.\n\nWe further fear having offended the dragon spirits by initiating construction on earth and wood, violating geomantic principles and contravening celestial timing. We dread the influences of the stellar lodges and the afflictions of yearly cycles, the clashes of the Nine Palaces and the conflicts of the Eight Trigrams. Obstruction runs deep, and our anxieties are acute. Therefore, we now perform this fast and practice the Dao, repenting for our transgressions. We kindle incense, recite scriptures, and pray to heaven to petition for life. May all calamities, sins, and faults be repented and eradicated. May the Great Unity extend life, and the Three Primes avert death. May the Jade Lads dispense medicine, and the Five Emperors bestow talismans. May the six viscera be harmonized, and the hundred passages flow freely. May longevity be prolonged and emolument endure, misfortune vanish and fortune arise.\n\nWe further pray that the nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and the six relations receive protection. May those who soar and those who sink fulfill their natures, and all beings, moving and still, be secure. Above, we wish for the imperial enterprise to flourish, heaven to endure and earth to last. May martial prowess be stilled, and civil virtue be consummated. May the sun’s wisdom shine doubly bright, and rivers float with sagely grace. May linked pearls and conjoined jades once more be seen in the dark heavens; may the Eight Trigrams and Nine Categories be re-revealed in the limpid Luo. May the three agricultural seasons proceed in order, and the nine grains know no fault. May drought and flood not arise, and pestilence not occur. May weapons be forever sheathed, and wind and rain come in due season.\n\nExtending to the hidden paths, may all sentient beings be universally included. May the ministers of yin and yang, the officials of mountains and rivers, propagate the Dao and pacify the people, punish the perverse and protect the upright. May all ascend the shore of fortune and together attain the stages of the Dao.\n\nMay the vast compassion of the Heavenly Venerable above be manifest, and may the sincere devotion of your servants below be answered.\n\nWe make our vows:\nFirst, may heaven and earth be bright and pure.\nSecond, may the atmosphere be clear and mysterious.\nThird, may the sage live ten thousand years.\nFourth, may transformation reach the eight boundaries.\nFifth, may heaven bestow sweet dew.\nSixth, may earth emit auspicious mists.\nSeventh, may the four seasons follow their course.\nEighth, may the myriad things be born whole.\nNinth, may families abound in filial piety and fraternal duty.\nTenth, may the state teem with talent and worthies.\nEleventh, may the officiants of this rite obtain blessings.\nTwelfth, may those who study the Dao attain immortality.\n\nWe replenish the incense burner. May the Incense Officials, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and the various spirit officials of the incense attend to where we present this incense, naturally generating golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred numinous perfected gather here before the incense burner. May we who study the Dao attain the Dao, and those who seek immortality attain immortality. May the sponsor of this fast receive blessings, and the living and deceased partake of grace. May the words we have uttered swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme, Boundless Dao, the Celestial Venerable of the Origin, in the Golden Portal and Jade Steps of the Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous.\n\nThe ritual concludes.\n*End of the Thirty-First Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast Rites*\n\n*The Thirty-Second Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast Rites*\n*Edited by

of the Void and Spontaneous Origin,\nthe Boundless Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao,\nthe Supreme Lord Lao,\nthe Jade Emperor of the August Heaven,\nthe perfected and divine lords and venerable sages of the ten directions who have attained the Dao,\nthe thirty-six Celestial Lords,\nthe Jade Purity Emperor,\nthe Jade Emperor the Great Emperor,\nthe Eastern Flower, Southern Culmen, Western

Masters of the Mysterious Center,\nand all the true numina of the three realms’ official retinues.\n\nWe have heard that before heaven and earth existed, the Primordial Origin spread the transformation of non-action;\nat the dawn of the primordial chaos, the Perfected Ones bequeathed the statutes of vast salvation.\nThus, the configurations of qi were divided among the Three Primordials,\nand boundless compassion was disseminated to the myriad beings.\nThe Three Officials were commanded to examine and assess,\nwhile the Five Emperors were entrusted to govern.\nPunishment and reward are impartial, grace and blessings extend afar.\n\nWe, having long received the shelter of the Dao, now encounter this auspicious conjunction of the mysterious.\nWe have studied the precious texts and perused the numinous mysteries,\nresolved to propagate the great transformation and aid the state and its people.\nOn the eight festivals and Three Primordials, establishing merit is fundamental.\nNow, as this Primordial’s seasonal rite arrives, on this propitious day of fasting and purification,\nwe offer thanks for transgressions and pray for grace—it is fitting to present our devout entreaties.\nMoreover, as we uphold the imperial edict, how dare we not make this known above?\n\n*Read the petition*\n\nIn accordance with the petition’s words, our resolve to cultivate and serve runs deep.\nMoreover, as this season’s rite arrives, we reverently perform the numinous scriptures.\nThe Luminous Statutes of the Supreme Ultimate record the ledgers of faults in the Nine Bureaus;\nthe canonical standards of the Mysterious Capital designate the Three Primordials as the great period of amnesty.\nThe merit of the fast extends afar to the living and deceased,\nwhile its beneficent influence flows broadly to family and state.\n\nWe, having joined together, have established the altar.\nWith lamps, candles, incense, and flowers, we pledge our hearts to the three realms.\nWith silk and ritual offerings, we present our petitions to the myriad heavens.\nWe hope that the Great Dao will achieve perfect communion,\ngazing upon our sincerity to bestow blessings;\nthat the Perfected Ones will respond in mystery,\nfollowing our repentance to shed their radiance.\n\nMay the flying celestial beings bear the Nine Dragon Talismanic Commands,\ntraversing the three realms to notify the four bureaus.\nMay they record the merit of this fast and attest to our earnest prayers.\n\nNow, at this morning’s Dao procession, we, the assembly of ritualists,\nkindle this first pinch of incense.\nMay its fragrant smoke ascend to the heavens,\ndirectly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves,\nlooking up to rely on the Three Supreme Ones.\nMay this merit flow to the august spirits of the altars of soil and grain and the ancestral sages of the ancestral temples.\nMay they ascend to the Golden Portal of Perfection and wander in the Jade Capital.\nMay they attend the Sacred Ancestor in the Upper Palace and bestow blessings upon the precious descendants.\n\nMay the Emperor’s lifespan rival Penglai’s immortals, his achievements match those of Shun and Yu.\nMay he harmonize the jade candle to pacify Hua and Yi,\nand solemnize the pearl’s orbit to still heaven and earth.\nMay the six palaces’ consorts and empresses possess inner virtue, reverent and enlightened.\nMay the Crown Prince and various princes flourish like jade branches.\nMay the civil and military ranks alike incline their hearts toward loyalty and filial piety;\nmay the four seas and ten thousand directions together blend under the transformative power of unified governance.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the virtue of the Perfected Ones, who after attaining the Dao ascend into formlessness, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nOn this morning audience, as we perform the Dao rites, we invite the dharma assembly to offer this first pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend directly to present offerings to the supreme and most true scriptural treasures. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves with heads to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three Supreme Ones. May the merit of this act flow to the patron of this retreat, such-and-such household—may their nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages of kin, their three masters and four companions, depart the dark night and ascend to behold the radiant light. May they bathe in the Pool of Flowing Fire and rest beneath the shade of the Hall of Bright Clouds. May they transcend to the highest realms, and may blessings and protection extend to the living.\n\nMay all within the Three Wretched Paths and Five Courses, the Six Realms and Nine Hells, have their names stricken from the ledgers of sin and their records of judgment erased. May they forever escape the depths of suffering and all be delivered.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the virtue of the Perfected Ones, who after attaining the Dao ascend into formlessness, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nOn this morning audience, as we perform the Dao rites, we invite the dharma assembly to offer this second pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend directly to present offerings to the supreme and most true master treasures. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves with heads to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three Supreme Ones. May the merit of this act flow to the patron of this retreat, such-and-such household—may their past transgressions dissolve, their calamities and misfortunes cease. May their lifespan be recorded in the Southern Palace and extended by the Eastern Dipper. May their family and kin all prosper, and auspicious signs gather in abundance.\n\nThereafter, may all sentient beings, whether moving or still, flying or submerged, equally receive the grace of this amnesty and together ascend to the realm of carefree wandering.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly, the virtue of the Perfected Ones, who after attaining the Dao ascend into formlessness, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nWe now perform the rites of repentance and confession.\n\nEach visualizes the nine-hued perfect image, swallows saliva, and recites the secret demon-commanding incantation. Treading the void in dance, circling in reverence, they prostrate to the Supreme, burn incense, and return to the formless. Radiant light follows their turn, and the Dharma-wheel likewise completes three revolutions. Mystic vows arise in the four quarters, and numinous blessings extend to kings and lords. Seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, their splendor spreading in glorious display. Their songs resound beyond the vast desert, and celestial music delights their joy. Together they offer fragrant virtue to the Supreme, with whom even the lower immortals cannot compare. Wondrous thoughts illumine dark enlightenment, and in throngs they ride the void in wandering. Circling, they tread the cloud-net, mounting the void to walk the dark principle. Chanting the hymns of the Lord of Unity, a hundred channels naturally harmonize. Below, they command the lads of the eight seas; above, they escort the lofty immortals. The hosts of heaven scatter flowers of incense, and a serene numinous wind arises. Long-held vows fix the root of destiny, thus attaining the highest eminence. Rejoicing before the Supreme, even ten thousand kalpas would not mark its beginning. Towering is the Dark Capital Mountain, where the ten directions revere the August One. Lofty is the Heavenly Treasure Terrace, its radiance streaming like the sun’s flame. Resplendent are the jade-forest blossoms, their crimson fruits gleaming bright. Ever mindful to feast on primordial essence, refining the fluids to secure bodily form. Golden light scatters through the Purple Tenuity, profound and serene, the Great Vehicle glides free.\n\n**Three Bows**\nWe, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity to the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao.\nWe, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity to the thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\n**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**\nWe, your humble servants, such-and-such and others, now respectfully reaffirm our address to the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Celestial Worthy, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm, the Three Master Lords, the High Ministers and High Chancellors, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, and all the divine officials of the Three Realms.\n\nWe, your servants, dust-bound and of humble merit, have accumulated good fortune over lifetimes to encounter this assembly. The mystic wind spreads universally, and the true teaching is proclaimed afar. Precious talismans and jade-scriptures descend from the Three Clarities to unfold transformation; dragon-writ and phoenix-edicts encompass the myriad sages in transmitting truth. Reverently receiving the guidance of our masters, we have all been graced with their instruction. Yet we have not been able to cultivate diligently nor preserve our ascent to flight. Only by establishing merit, delivering people, and aiding beings can we repay the virtue of the Perfect Dao in shaping all things and requite the benevolence of heaven and earth in covering and supporting all. Whatever beings turn their hearts toward it should be duly reported.\n\nThe patron of this retreat, such-and-such, has learned that the Three Primes possess their ranks, and the Supreme Sages have bequeathed their texts. This is the season when the Celestial Prime renews its mandate, the day when the Three Palaces of the Emperor issue their amnesty. Both the hidden and the manifest receive protection, and all that moves or grows is touched by grace. Privately reflecting that to repay one’s lord and parents, nothing precedes the building of blessings; to serve one’s family and country, nothing surpasses the merit of this retreat. Thus we prostrate at the numinous altar, turning our hearts to the Supreme Sages. Bearing the tokens of the Dharma, we have reverently established this ritual precinct. Jade pendants and pearl banners mingle with sacred regalia in dazzling splendor; whale-bell and phoenix-chime lead the immortal chants in ethereal measure. The Perfected and Sages draw near from afar, and our sincerity is lifted upward. We humbly pray that the great treasure of your numinous influence may bless and protect the imperial enterprise. May the phoenix calendar be subtly extended, and the dragon majesty firmly secured. May the emperor’s sagacity surpass that of Fuxi and Huangdi, his benevolence equal that of Yao and Shun. May the myriad dwellings rest in harmony, and the nine regions submit to transformation. May the three frontiers be pacified, forever free from the toil of beacon fires; may the eight extremities shine in clarity, ever open to tribute from afar. May the imperial enterprise of Great Peace outshine all rivals. May the stars follow their courses in the nine heavens, and wind and rain be balanced through the four seasons. May weapons, disease, and epidemics not afflict the common people; may floods, droughts, fires, and locusts not arise within the kingdom’s borders.\n\nNext, we pray for the household of the patron of this retreat: may the nine lineages be delivered, and the five clans live in harmony. May their name be inscribed in the south for accumulated goodness, and their record of transgressions erased in the northern bureau. May calamities not arise, and blessings be ever renewed. May their official emoluments be increased in the heavenly palace, and their lifespan extended in the immortal precincts. Thereafter, may the frozen courts of the long night and the riverine realms of Fengdu be transformed. May dark prisons become pure and tranquil abodes, and hells be converted into realms of formlessness. May all beings fulfill their natures, and every kind awaken. May heaven endure and earth abide, ever advancing in the Dao’s transformation. Above, may the radiant grace of the Heavenly Worthy of Vast Salvation be manifest; below, may the sincerity of we, your servants, in turning toward the Dao be answered.\n\nRespectfully we make this address known.\n\n**Initiating the Vows**\nFirst vow: for the four great elements of the Dao to unite in virtue with the patron of this retreat. May the seven generations of parents escape suffering and sorrow, ascend to heaven, and enjoy natural sustenance.\n\nSecond vow: for the emperor and lords of the realm, that the Dao’s transformation flourish. May schools and academies thrive, and the imperial teaching expand. May their majesty and decorum be revered, and all under heaven look upon them. May the people praise Great Peace, and the four barbarians submit. May evil and perversity vanish of themselves, and sages and worthies arise naturally.\n\nThird vow: for the Dharma Master, that great merit be established. May their teaching and transformation be clear and far-reaching, and all attain flight as immortals.\n\nFourth vow: for fellow students of the Dao. May they swiftly attain the immortal way and mutually aid one another in deliverance.\n\nFifth vow: for the nine relations to live in harmony, esteeming benevolence and righteousness. May they value the Dao and scorn wealth, their conduct a model for all beings.\n\nSixth vow: to diminish oneself and bestow alms upon Daoist masters and those who suffer hunger and cold. May all people under heaven find their proper place.\n\nSeventh vow: for creeping and crawling beings. May all sentient beings equally achieve fulfillment.\n\nEighth vow: to pardon past transgressions. May the sins of this life be redressed by establishing merit to compensate for faults.\n\nNinth vow: for the flourishing of the household. May the ancestral temple have descendants, and worthy talent arise in every generation.\n\nTenth vow: to honor and receive the scripture masters, never daring to grow remiss, but maintaining a single, equal mind. May all beings be broadly delivered, and all attain the rank of immortal. May they ascend to heaven in broad daylight, pay homage to the Supreme, and forever become Perfected Ones, riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages. Harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nThe incense is replenished.\n\nIncense Official Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attending Incense Spirit-Officials—may they cause the place where this servant burns incense to naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred numinous Perfected Ones gather here, assembling before the grotto-altar and incense burner. May this servant, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions receive the rising incense smoke and swiftly convey the words this servant has just uttered directly to the August Jade Court of the Supreme, Boundless, Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Dao.\n\n*Exiting the chamber*\n*End of the Thirty-Second Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Retreat Rites*\n*Thirty-Third Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Retreat Rites*\n*Edited by Tang Dynasty Master Du Guangting of Broad Completion Abbey*\n\n*Entering the chamber*\n*Dividing the Three Primordials to perform the Dao*\n*Upon entering, each bows to the master and visualizes as prescribed*\n\n**Guardian Spirits**\nChanting the *Empty Cavern* hymns, the Thearch visualizes the altar.\nThe Five Emperors review records,\nReceiving talismans from the Three Officials.\nFour gates are guarded,\nDemons bound and traitors expelled.\nFiery bells cast forth,\nBanishing filth and burning remnants.\nThe body bears the golden scripture,\nRefining the elixir to rejuvenate the countenance.\nMysterious void and plain harmony,\nThe heart moves the Three Passes.\nRiding lions and mounting cranes,\nCommanding dragons and mounting simurghs.\nTen thousand stars guard the abode,\nA thousand demons dare not intrude.\nThe Dao-qi endures,\nMyriad immortals rest in peace.\n\n*Strike the dharma drum twenty-four times*\n\nThe Supreme Dark Prime, Most High Dao Lord, summons forth from within this servant’s body:\nThe Three and Five Merit Officers,\nLeft and Right Attending Messengers,\nIncense-Bearing Golden Youths,\nMessage-Conveying Petal-Scattering Jade Maidens,\nFive Emperors’ Direct Talisman-Holders,\nDirect-Day Incense Spirits—\nthirty-two of each—emerge.\nEmerging, they solemnly prepare and open the gates of the Mystic Altar’s Heavenly Thearch Spirit Lords, calling forth the local earth gods, domain spirits, and true officials of this place.\nOn this occasion, with utmost sincerity, may the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity Dao-qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend, flowing into the bodies of this servant and all present, swiftly conveying the words this servant has uttered directly to the August Jade Court of the Supreme, Boundless, Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Dao.\n\n*Each declares their dharma rank*\n\nWe, your servants, [names], together with one heart, reverently address the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Venerable, the Boundless Supreme Dao Lord, the Great Sage Ancestor, Highest Supreme Dao, Golden Court Mysterious Prime Heavenly August Emperor, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Elder, the Dark Prime Supreme Elder;\nThe perfected and sagely lords and elders of the ten directions who have already attained the Dao;\nThe thirty-six Heavenly Thearchs;\nThe Jade Clarity Highest Emperor;\nThe Jade Emperor;\nThe Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, Mystic Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Court, Seven-Jewel Mystic Terrace, Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord;\nThe Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center;\nThe officials and all true numina of the Three Realms—\n\nWe, by former vast causes, have been able to receive the mysterious transformation, bearing the great Dharma and wearing the precious scriptures. Truly, we should lift our traces to the cloudy groves, nest our spirits in the tranquil vastness, shake our robes free of the vulgar, and pursue friendship with the highest Perfected. Yet the Great Sages have bestowed their regulations, and the Primordial August One has spread the teachings. First, we must aid the state and proclaim transformation, succoring beings and pacifying the people, propagating the Dao and establishing merit, broadly covering all kinds. For every prayer and supplication, how dare we not report it above?\n\n*Reading the petition*\nAccording to the words of the petition, it is fitting to submit this report.\nThe retreat master, [name], above reveres the ancestral temples, below extends to all beings. Hoping to establish good merit and broadly propagate excellent blessings, especially as this is the auspicious season of the [specific] Primordial Festival, a day of purification and retreat. The Jade Emperor presides above, and the ten thousand sages review merit in the Three Realms. The living and the dead share in blessings, not a hair’s breadth omitted. Thus, we perform this rite of prayer and supplication to express the sincerity of human servants. Holding the Dharma tokens, we have reverently established the altar. We, your servants, relying on the canonical rites, concentrate our spirits and purify our thoughts, directing our hearts to the Crimson Palace and bowing our hands to the Pure Capital. We hope that feathered canopies and cloud chariots will descend in semblance, that the highest Perfected and august Sages will vaguely manifest their presence, bestowing blessings across seas and mountains, encompassing the hidden and the manifest with their protection.\n\nToday, at the noon audience, we, the Dharma assembly, perform the first offering of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao. We, your servants, surrender our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to the Three Supreme Ones of the Most High. May this merit, above, benefit the sacred spirits of the altars of soil and grain and the ancestral temples, causing them to ascend to the Azure Heavens and bestow blessings upon the imperial domain.\n\nMay the Emperor’s virtue equal that of Fuxi and Shennong, his merit match that of the Yellow Emperor and Emperor Yan. May the mountain of his longevity grow ever higher, the sun of his sagacity shine ever brighter. May the tracks of chariots unite, weapons be stilled, the stars and planets move in harmony, wind and rain come in season. May the Crown Prince and the various kings inherit the celestial mandate and continue the sagely line. May the Empress, consorts, princesses, the hundred officials, and all ministers daily receive new blessings, their illustrious glory flourishing. Thereafter, may civil arts embrace distant customs, martial arts pacify perilous crises. Within the seas and the realm, may all ascend to the realm of longevity.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of the Master, in the virtue of the Perfected Ones, who after attaining the Dao ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nAt this noon audience, as we perform the Daoist rites and invoke the Dharma assembly, we offer this two-pinch incense. May its fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, ascending directly to make offering to the supreme and most true scriptural treasures.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves with heads to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three Supreme Ones. May these merits flow back to the winding springs of the cold courts, to the eternal night of Fengdu. May all the hidden spirits of the nether palaces and earthly prisons—along with the nine generations and seven lineages of the ritual sponsor’s family, their countless ancestors and myriad forebears—emerge from the depths of darkness and ascend to the courts of the Great Ultimate. May their names be stricken from the ledgers of sin in the Northern Bureau, and may they wander in the purified realms of the gods; may their lives be inscribed in the Southern Palace’s registers of the living, and may they attain the ranks of immortality.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of the Master, in the virtue of the Perfected Ones, who after attaining the Dao ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nAt this noon audience, as we perform the Daoist rites and invoke the Dharma assembly, we offer this three-pinch incense. May its fragrant smoke rise to the heavens, ascending directly to make offering to the supreme and most true Master’s treasures.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves with heads to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three Supreme Ones. May these merits flow throughout the heavens and earth, within the transformative power of the Dao. May all bathe in the mysterious workings of the Dao and together receive the blessings of the Perfected Ones. May the ritual sponsor’s calamities and misfortunes be extinguished, their transgressions and faults dissolved. May the true spirits of the Three Realms secretly augment their blessings, and may the nine elixirs’ secret wonders eternally preserve their years. May inner and outer realms alike know peace, and may the living and the dead together enjoy prosperity.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of the Master, in the virtue of the Perfected Ones, who after attaining the Dao ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nWe perform the rites and offer repentance.\n\nEach visualizes the nine-colored spherical image, swallows saliva, and recites the secret incantation to command demons. Stepping in the void, circling in procession, bowing and rising while contemplating the Most High, the radiant splendor flourishes in the cinnabar field. Glancing left, one uplifts the somber essence; gazing right, one grasps the resplendent brilliance. The Six Perfections crown the pure conduct, and virtue and the Dao renew with each dawn. Accumulated blessings from past lives respond, and hearing the scriptures feels as intimate as kin. Heaven-endowed with transcendent talent, joyfully reciting the subtle and profound texts, one breathes the qi of supreme harmony, exhaling and inhaling the essence of flowing clouds. Embryonic breathing stills the hundred passages, and in profound emptiness, one masters the three conveniences. The Niwan Palace shines with luminous splendor, and thus one becomes an immortal of golden radiance. The Demon Kings respectfully receive their charge, enabling ascent to the heavens. All begins with fasting and precepts, accumulating merit to bind past-life affinities. Soaring through the great void, one uplifts the loftiest beings, guiding the reins to traverse the ten directions, resting upon the slopes of the darkly radiant peaks. Gazing up at the Terrace of Kalpas, looking down upon the purple cloud net, one roams the Most High’s capital, sitting together upon lotus blossoms. Through accumulated study, one becomes a Perfected Person, serene and harmonious in vital essence. Endlessly enjoying boundless longevity, why count the myriad cedars? The great Dao’s master is profound stillness, and the immortal companion is the peerless hero. The noble scion bestows the spirit talisman, while the Great One bears the cavernous scriptures. The relics gleam with golden form, and the dragon chariot swiftly arrives to welcome. The Heavenly Worthy gazes upon the cloud carriage, soaring lightly through the void. Fragrant blossoms fall like snow, and misty vapors flourish upon the darkly radiant beams.\n\n**Three Bows**\nWe, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Most High Boundless Great Dao.\nWe, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.\n\n**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**\nWe, your humble servants, so-and-so and others, respectfully reaffirm and address the Most High Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Supreme Mysterious Ancient; the Perfect, Boundless Great Dao and the Host of Sagely Worthies; the Heavenly Worthies and Perfected Ones; the Great Emperors and Heavenly Thearchs; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the Three Masters; the High Ministers and Prime Ministers; the Four Directors and Five Emperors; and all the divine officials and true spirits of the Three Realms.\n\nWe reflect upon our lowly and humble station, yet bathed in the mysterious wind of the Dao. Elevated in the ranks of the Dao, our names are listed among the true teachings. We have glimpsed the profundities of the Three Caverns and Five Scriptures, perused the dragon-bound and phoenix-scribed texts. Yet we have not hidden our traces or concealed our names in secluded forests and remote valleys, aspiring to ascension and eternal adherence to the numinous regulations. At the outset of receiving the Dharma, we made a pact with the Three Officials: our duty is first to succor beings, assisting the state and transforming the times. Establishing the teachings and accomplishing merit, we exhaust our sincerity and integrity.\n\nNow, the ritual sponsor so-and-so petitions with earnest devotion, for the state and for the people, offering heartfelt loyalty and presenting incense and flowers as tokens of faith. We request the exalted fast and Dharma to repay the sovereign and parents. Moreover, the Three Primes are the season of great amnesty, when the living and the dead receive blessings; the Three Radiances mark the days of great illumination, when the hidden and the manifest are enlightened. In the Upper Palace of the Dark Capital, the Golden Gates of the Purple Tenuity, the myriad heavens hold their courtly feasts, and the host of sages turn their chariots. Absolving transgressions and elevating merit are fitting for this auspicious occasion. Dispelling calamities and invoking blessings, we pray for flourishing times.\n\nWe, in accordance with the canonical statutes, reverently perform the fast and vigil. Establishing the altar and practicing the Dao, we model earth after heaven. Burning incense and lighting lamps, we illuminate the dark night. The fragrant smoke ascends to the heavens, awaiting the true sages’ distant descent. May our sincerity reach them, and may we receive their abundant grace.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Three Clarities’ sagely worthies and the eight poles’ lofty venerables deign to lend their majestic radiance, bringing peace to the state’s fortunes. May they secure and pacify the altars of soil and grain, purifying and ordering the realm. May the emperor’s dual brilliances shine equally, his longevity matching the mountains. May he dredge the vast sources without end, bearing the vermilion screen with effortless governance. May the eight seas and nine continents see the cessation of weapons, and the three frontiers and six directions know no alarm from blades or arrows. May he rival the Three and Five in eminence, surpassing the sagacity of Fuxi and Shennong. May the winds of the Winnowing Basket and rains of the Net bring harmony, ensuring abundant harvests; may the sun of Shun and clouds of Yao shine resplendently, bringing peace to the myriad regions. May the crown prince embody the image of brightness and separation, and the various princes stand firm as bedrock. Within the six palaces, virtue is surely cultivated; among the hundred ministers, loyal counsel is clearly manifest. Climbing mountains and crossing seas, all follow the sagacious decrees. From distant lands and foreign domains, all converge under the Dao’s transformation. May the frontiers be tranquil and orderly, and near and far rejoice in well-being. May pestilence not arise, and calamitous omens vanish of themselves.\n\nThen, may the long-night abodes of the Nine Darks and the realms of the Three Paths and Six Destinies see the deliverance of the nine generations of ancestors and the three masters. May the ritual sponsor so-and-so’s accumulated transgressions from past lives be cleansed and dissolved through repentance; may the thousand disasters and myriad afflictions be washed away by the true spirits. Renewed in fortune and lifespan, may they eternally enjoy benefit and integrity. May their inner and outer kin all attain supreme auspiciousness. May those who soar and those who sink fulfill their natures, and may all creatures be secure. Within heaven and earth, may no being lose its place. May the Heavenly Worthy’s vast compassion above respond to our devoted sincerity below.\n\n**Petitions**\nFirst, we pray that the Great Dao remain serene and empty, tranquil and still, dwelling in clarity. May it widely open the Dharma gates, instructing the stubborn and ignorant. May all receive its beneficent grace, cultivating diligently and austerely. May we, together with our fellow students, universally ascend to the void, preserving ourselves with heaven and abiding forever without care.\n\nSecond, we pray that the various heavens condense their qi and clarify their essence, vast and lofty in their coverage, preserving the true and securing the numinous. May the climate be harmonious, the four seasons balanced. May the state be secure and the people prosperous, the world at peace. May all be broadly succored, and beneficence reach all beings. May heaven be preserved eternally, enduring for countless kalpas without collapse.\n\nThird, we pray that the earth endure in its covering and bearing without end, stable and unshaken, the seas not engulfing or collapsing. May it secure and protect the state and families, and the multitudes of people flourish. May it nurture the living and pacify the dead, its beneficence encompassing the ten directions. May crops and plants flourish, and enterprises daily prosper. May all receive its abundant support, and the myriad things follow accordingly.\n\nFourth, we pray that the sun and moon, the two luminaries, shine brightly, without eclipses or disturbances, their waxing and waning serene and clear. May their light illuminate the heavens, dispelling all darkness. May they safeguard the kalpas and ensure peaceful reigns. May they universally bestow moisture and grace, showering blessings upon all beings.\n\nFifth, we pray that the stars and constellations shine with brilliance equal to the sun and moon. Turning like candles in the night, may they brightly illuminate the ten directions. May each remain in its proper place, their celestial paths straight and true. May they safeguard and secure the state and families, free from harm or calamity. May the four seas be tranquil and unified, and all under heaven flourish and prosper.\n\nSixth, we pray that the four seasons progress in due order. May their climates be harmonious and balanced, free from disaster or affliction. May pestilence and poison vanish, and all under heaven enjoy peace and stability. May the five grains ripen in abundance, the state prosper, and the people rejoice.\n\nSeventh, we pray that floating clouds gather qi and amass mist. Soaring high and clear in the heavens, may they shade and cover the profound and mysterious. When concealed, they remain in non-action; when dispersed, they fill the sky. May immortals and transcendent beings dwell together, forming friendships with the multitude of perfected ones. May their beneficence flow to all, fostering the state and cherishing the people. May they universally succor all beings, and humanity endure as long as the kalpas.\n\nEighth, we pray that wind and rain flow and descend without end. May they universally bestow their release, nurturing growth and flourishing. May the myriad things thrive, the state’s stores be abundant, and the people prosper.\n\nNinth, we pray that the Five Peaks each remain in their proper place, towering and encompassing, ever serving as palaces of the immortals. May they secure and stabilize the state’s destiny, preserving heaven without end. May they protect and deliver all beings, none who do not revere and honor them.\n\nTenth, we pray that rivers and seas flow boundlessly, vast and without limit. Embracing and containing with magnanimity, may they nurture even the smallest of things. Profound and gentle in their kindness, may they moisten and sustain all that wriggles and breathes. May heaven and humanity receive blessings, their years enduring like the kalpas and stone.\n\nEleventh, we pray that the emperor and the kingdom’s lands daily prosper. May the four frontiers be peaceful and harmonious, weapons and warfare unraised. May heaven and humanity sing in praise, auspicious omens descending in flight. May teachings be disseminated with solemnity, and virtuous transformation spread far and wide. May the multitudes rejoice in celebration, their joy unending.\n\nTwelfth, we pray that all creatures—those that soar, crawl, or stir, whether born or yet unborn—may universally receive safety and security, attaining life and growth. May they all behold the primordial qi, receiving the forms of yang. May grasses, trees, fruits, and forests endure winter without withering. May all be delivered and uplifted, none that do not flourish in fresh splendor. May harmony unite with the Dao in truth, returning to the crucible.\n\nMay the Fragrant Office Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant spirit-officials of incense cause the places where I offer incense to spontaneously generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred numinous perfected beings gather here, assembling before the crucible. May I, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality.\n\nMay the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the rising incense smoke, swiftly conveying the words I have just uttered directly to the August Jade Sovereign of the Golden Portal of the Supreme Boundless Dao—formless, nameless, void, and spontaneous.\n\n*Exiting the chamber*\n*End of the Thirty-Third Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Retreat Rites*\n*Thirty-Fourth Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Retreat Rites*\n*Revised by Master Du Guangting of Tang’s Guangcheng*\n\n*Performing the Three Primes’ Dusk Circumambulation*\n*Entering the chamber*\n*Each bows to the master, visualizing as prescribed*\n\nThe guardian spirits’ radiance shines bright, auspicious qi swirling in coils. The Winnowing Basket and Dipper gleam with limpid light, the halls of mushrooms serene. Jade pupils and golden perfected ones, the precious altar pure yang. Night transformed into day, the hour returned to before noon. Mount Tai’s hues flow in splendor, the vermilion phoenix soars in flight. Demons stilled, treachery extinguished, one strides high through auspicious mist. Heavenly perfected gather in full, all arriving before the Emperor.\n\n*Strike the dharma drum twenty-four times*\n\nThe Supreme Dao Lord of the Mysterious Origin summons forth from within my body the Three-and-Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Incense-Attending Golden Youths, the Word-Conveying Petal-Scattering Jade Maidens, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-two each. Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn attire, to open the gates of the mysterious altar and invoke the local earth deities and true officials of this realm. On this day, we humbly pray that the wondrous light of the Jade Clarity Dao-qi and Numinous Treasure may descend and flow into our bodies. Immediately, let golden radiance blaze forth, bearing the qi of Upper Clarity aloft. May the words we have uttered swiftly reach the August Jade Sovereign of the Golden Portal of the Supreme Boundless Dao—formless, nameless, void, and spontaneous.\n\n*Each declares their dharma rank*\n\nWe, your humble servants, [Names] and others, with sincere devotion jointly prostrate and address the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Boundless Dao and Supreme Dao Lord, the Great Sacred Ancestor and Highest August Dao Sovereign of the Golden Portal of the Mysterious Origin, the Heavenly Emperor of the Jade Clarity, the Supreme Lord Lao, the August Jade Thearch, the perfected and sagely hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors, the Jade Clarity Thearch, the Great Jade Thearch, the Eastern Florescence and Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous and Northern Perfected, the Mysterious Capital and Jade Metropolis, the Golden Portal and Seven-Jewel Mysterious Terrace, the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, and the Numinous Treasure Perfected Sovereign of Luminous Augustness, the thirty-six revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, and all the divine officials of the Three Realms.\n\nWe have heard that the wondrous Dao of non-action encompasses the myriad methods in its supremacy; the true lineage of purity and quiescence governs the Three Primes to nurture beings. Its divine transformations greatly flourish, universally delivering the multitudes. Thus, the officials of heaven, earth, and water oversee the clarity of transgressions and blessings; the clerks of yin and yang assess fortune and misfortune. The flying celestials recite the jade-casket texts, while the highest sages request the jade-case registers. From families to states, all are permitted to repent and pray. Whether manifest or hidden, all are surely enabled to attain liberation.\n\nWe have long received the mysterious teachings and been entrusted with the luminous statutes. Our aspiration lies in establishing merit and disseminating true transformation. In all matters requiring supplication, how dare we not make this known above?\n\n*Reading the petition*\n\nAs the words declare, our resolve runs deep in devotion. Moreover, at this season of the rite, we ought to offer our sincerest prayers. This is indeed the time when the heavens hold their courtly feasts, and grace flows through all ranks; it is the assembly where the ten thousand sages proclaim their compassion, and mercy extends to the ten directions. Thus, we reverently knock upon the mysterious gate and diligently perform the Yellow Register rites. Universally, we repent and deliver both the living and the dead, guiding all families and states to take refuge. Together, we exert our cinnabar sincerity, looking upward in hope of vast blessings.\n\nTonight, as we perform the circumambulation and invoke the dharma assembly, we first offer this pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full submission, reverently relying upon the Three Supreme Worthies. May the merit of this act flow to the august spirits of the nine ancestral temples and the successive generations of sagely ancestors, allowing their spirits to wander the Great Vastness and behold the wondrous Upper Clarity. May it extend blessings to future generations and gather great felicity for the imperial enterprise. May the Emperor’s transformation equal that of the Three Sovereigns and Five Thearchs, his longevity surpassing billions and thousands. May he grasp the Great Image to govern heaven and embody the soaring dragon to establish the ultimate. May the Crown Prince, the Empress, and the imperial consorts assist in the sagely governance; may the loyal ministers and upright officials safeguard the prosperous fortune.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of Masters, in their perfect virtue, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless. Harmonious, they unite with the true Dao.\n\nOn this evening audience in the performance of the Dao, we invoke the ritual assembly and offer this second pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend directly to make offering to the supreme, most perfect Treasure of Scriptures. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to reverently rely upon the Three Supreme Worthies. May the merit of this act flow to the patron of this retreat, the household of so-and-so. May their karmic bonds of kalpas past and the spirits of nine generations ascend to the Purple Palace of Perfection and refine their luminous forms in the Vermilion Numinosity. May they ride the swift winds and wear the constellations as a crown, reach the Celestial Capital and depart the gates of earth. May their blessings flow without end, their felicity and benefit manifest in the present.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Host of Masters, in their perfect virtue, who after attaining the Dao ascended into the formless. Harmonious, they unite with the true Dao.\n\nOn this evening audience in the performance of the Dao, we invoke the ritual assembly and offer this third pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend directly to make offering to the supreme, most perfect Treasure of Masters. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to reverently rely upon the Three Supreme Worthies. May the merit of this act flow to the patron of this retreat, the household of so-and-so. May their five clans and six relations alike be moistened by radiant protection. May calamities spontaneously cease and karmic entanglements dissolve entirely. May the Four Seas and Nine Provinces together bathe in the transformation of harmony and peace; may all sentient beings receive the breeze of purity and stillness. May the gates of the nightly palaces and the springs of the underworld all be opened and delivered. May those that fly, those that hide, those that creep, and those that move all attain safety.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of Masters, in their perfect virtue. Having attained the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the True.\n\nWe bow in reverence, repent, and pace the void,\ncircling in procession to bow our heads before the Golden Gates,\nhand in hand we roam the Jade Capital.\nThe soaring trees adorn the Garden of Rounded Light,\nresplendent with the Seven Jeweled Grove.\nThree hundred celestial beasts in

precepts of salvation and deliverance.\n\nHaving poured forth our sincere devotion,\nwe gaze upward to extol the vast transformation.\n\nWe have heard that in the Jasper Capital and Golden Towers,\nthe assembly of supreme sages and venerables\nobserves the suffering realms through the Eight Gates,\nand sets forth the compassionate vessel across the Three Realms.\nThey protect and

transformation.\nBorn into the multitude of beings,\nwe deliver and uplift the sunken and suffering.\n\nBy grace of our masters’ guidance, we bear the secret registers of the Three Clarities; through reverent reception of the Mystic Decree, we chant the true scriptures of the Three Caverns. Ranked among the immortal orders, our names ascend the jade tablets. Yet we have not yet refined spirit and burnished bone, nor severed traces to attain the empty breast. In vain do we abide at the Gate of All Wonders, often transgressing the statutes of the Luminous Perfected. Formerly, on the day we received the Dharma, we pledged alliance to the Five Emperors and swore oaths to the Three Officials—to deliver and uplift heaven and humanity, to aid and assist family and state. Whatever prayers are offered, by principle they must be declared. Today, our earnest sincerity is too profound to suppress. Having received the petition’s intent, how dare we not report it above?\n\n**Reading the Petition**\nAs the petition humbly states, its principles succor the hidden and the manifest. The patron of this retreat, through kalpas of accumulated merit and virtues surpassing all heavens, reveres the great transformation of the spontaneous and worships the Primordial Honored One of the Boundless. They assist the state and guide the sovereign, cherishing kin and serving elders. Embracing the profound intent of deliverance and uplift, they pity the sunken souls of the hidden depths. Moved by compassion, their hearts grieve and their aspirations pour forth. Following the sagely teachings, they repay great kindness. Unfolding the canons of the Yellow Register, they open the ranks of the Mystic Altar. With solemn adornment and reverent offerings of incense and flowers, they invoke the spirits of the Three Officials and Five Emperors, and pay homage to the sages of the Golden Portal and Jade Chambers.\n\nWe, in accordance with the scriptures and in observance of the precepts, purify our thoughts and concentrate our spirits, cleansing our minds and fixing our devotion. Today, at the noon audience as we perform the Dao, the assembly of Dharma-pleaders raises the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High and Perfectly True Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Supreme. May these merits, above, benefit the ancestral temples and imperial altars of the august house, their numinous might harmonizing with the effortless and their achievements manifesting in perfect fulfillment. May the dragon’s chart of the emperor endure forever, the phoenix’s reign flourish evermore. May the realm be unified in culture and governance, harmonious as seas and mountains. May the myriad people rely on this, all affairs be upright. May virtuous transformation shine forth, generations flourish abundantly. May the ten thousand regions be tranquil, the nine luminaries radiant and exalted.\n\nThose who withdraw to cultivate perfection, their teachers and parents, all may roam the eight poles and swiftly ascend the Three Clarities. For this reason, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely assembly of the Perfected, whose virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless.\n\nToday, at the noon audience as we perform the Dao, the assembly of Dharma-pleaders raises the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High and Perfectly True Treasure of the Scriptures.\n\nWe surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Supreme. May these merits confer blessings upon the patron of this retreat. May the ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears, the departed spirits, have their names stricken from the registers of doom and their merits inscribed in the tablets of record. May they ascend as perfected beings to serene realms, their blessings flowing to descendants. Abiding long in the steadfastness of the One, may their names be exalted in posterity; eternally cherishing the Three Treasures, may their teachings be handed down to future generations.\n\nFor this reason, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely assembly of the Perfected, whose virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless, harmonizing with the true Dao.\n\nToday, at the noon audience as we perform the Dao, the assembly of Dharma-pleaders raises the third pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High and Perfectly True Treasure of the Masters.\n\nWe surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Supreme. May these merits extend grace to all beings, bestowing blessings upon the myriad people. May all attain fulfillment in life and growth, each equally sharing in benefit and relief. Extending to the drifting souls of travelers and the wandering spirits of the waves—those who have suffered the deep calamities of the eight difficulties and escaped the extreme torments of the nine dark realms—may their names, not yet erased from the black registers nor recorded in the cinnabar books, all receive the compassionate favor of the Honored Ones. Command the Heavenly Officials to record them in full, instruct the Earth Prisons to gather them completely. May they all come to the altar feast and partake in deliverance and salvation. May they forever depart from evil destinies, all plant the roots of goodness. Sheltered in the heavens and among humanity, may they be reborn in bliss.\n\nFor this reason, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely assembly of the Perfected. Their virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless, harmonizing with the true Dao.\n\n**Repentance**\nThreefold Invocation.\n\nAmidst the flourishing of states and households,\nThe Way of scriptures thrives in solemn splendor.\nHeaven and humankind share a single aspiration,\nAscending into the vastness of the Great Vehicle.\nBy the heart’s intent, the field of blessings is established,\nAnd the Wheel of Dharma rises in boundless ascent.\nMay the seven ancestors ascend to the heavenly halls,\nWhile my own form soars in the light of day.\n\n**Threefold Prostration**\nWe, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,\nTo the Supreme Primordial Dao of the Utmost Pole.\nWe, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,\nTo the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,\nTo the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\n**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**\nWe, the disciples of the Upper Clarity and Mystic Capital, the Masters of [such-and-such] Peak, once more invoke:\nThe Supreme Primordial Dao of the Limitless, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning;\nThe Supreme Lord of the Great Dao;\nThe Supreme Lord Lao;\nThe Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;\nThe Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;\nAnd all the perfected and numinous beings within and beyond the Three Realms, in the sacred mountains and grotto-heavens.\n\nWe, your servants, have heard that the Supreme Mystery acts,\nReceiving the non-acting to become acting;\nThe Most Sagely is without partiality,\nGiving life to beings yet remaining without attachment.\nIt nurtures and shapes all things,\nHalting poison and fostering growth.\nIts use is inexhaustible, its divine power ungoverned.\nIt proclaims the work of vast opening,\nAnd magnifies the gate of deliverance and salvation.\nThe net is cast wide, its great trust silent and profound.\n\nNow, the master of this fast, [so-and-so], perceiving the subtle and pondering the distant,\nKnocks upon the silent to seek the mysterious, spanning kalpas before Heaven.\nThe ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears,\nTheir forms dispersed and qi scattered,\nHave left residual karmic afflictions,\nExtending even to his own person.\nReaching to kin and dependents,\nThey cycle through birth and death,\nCreating transgressions and faults.\nLooking up, he relies on the texts of repentance and cleansing,\nHoping for the favor of purification and absolution.\nAdmiring the principle of deliverance by the Mystic Venerable,\nHe solemnly observes the rites with reverence;\nFollowing the statutes of salvation by the Supreme Sages,\nHe strictly upholds the fast and precepts.\nWith golden dragon talismans and offerings of faith,\nHe approaches the sacred thrones to pay homage to the Perfected.\nReciting the numinous scriptures, he devoutly prays for the sages’ protection.\n\nFurther considering the officiants of this fast,\nWho hold positions of governance and oversee regions,\nThe weal and woe of the people rest upon them,\nAnd the creation of blessings depends entirely on their prayers and supplications.\nWeary from the toils of the rite, their myriad concerns,\nThey bind their hearts in earnest devotion.\nThey think of the meritorious and worthy,\nExtending to the masses.\nSome established merit in service to the state,\nPerishing in royal affairs;\nSome, facing peril, forgot their families,\nDying in foreign lands far from home;\nSome, as merchants or traders, amassed wealth at the cost of their lives;\nSome, as officials, compromised integrity, taking bribes and losing their lives;\nSome succumbed to epidemics;\nSome were caught in rebellion and plunder.\nThose beyond pardon were executed,\nLeaving them childless and without heirs,\nTheir tonsured remains burned,\nTheir yin souls without refuge, their yang souls without support.\nDeprived of offerings in spring and autumn,\nTheir messages carried only by crows and magpies.\nGathered, they become disasters of drought and flood;\nScattered, they become pests of locusts and caterpillars.\nThough their merit was great, it went unrecognized,\nWith no means to be enshrined and venerated;\nThough their crimes were grave, they may yet repent,\nSeeking refuge to amend their ways.\nAll sink into the Five Sufferings,\nAll stagnate in the Nine Dark Realms.\nWithout the grace of the Mystic Ones,\nThey cannot escape the netherworld.\n\nWe humbly beseech the Merciful and Sagely True Lord of the Northern Culmen,\nTo command the spirits of mountains, rivers, and earth,\nThe lords of altars, temples, and city gods,\nTo pursue, summon, and guide them,\nSearching far and wide.\nMay they all come to the numinous altar,\nTo listen and receive.\nMay they all renounce the ghostly registers,\nAnd don the celestial regalia.\nBathed in the waves of grace,\nMay they transcend to the fruits of sageliness.\nAscending to the Golden Gates in carefree ease,\nThey shall offer praise in the Jade Capital.\nWith the sages’ boundless favor,\nAnd the gods’ power to uplift,\nMay they be reborn within the Middle Kingdom,\nSurely entering the gates of supreme goodness.\n\nThus, we pray that the master of this fast may extend blessings to kin and allies,\nHonor spreading to the loyal and filial.\nMay calamities be utterly extinguished,\nAnd auspicious qi converge as one.\nMay the earth’s vitality flourish,\nAnd Heaven’s patterns shine in mystery.\nMay baleful stars withdraw their radiance,\nAnd propitious qi surge with light.\nMay the Mystic Transformation expand,\nAnd the imperial domain flourish.\nMay rivers run clear and seas be calm,\nRain fall in season and winds be gentle.\nMay the hundred grains burgeon in abundance,\nAnd the five weapons be stilled.\nMay the myriad people enjoy wealth and joy,\nAnd the Nine Virtues shine forth.\nMay all things thrive,\nAnd all creatures fulfill their natures.\n\nAbove, may the Celestial Worthies’ compassionate grace descend;\nBelow, may our sincerity in devotion be answered.\n\n**Respectfully presented for your attention.**\n\n**Vows**\nFirst, we vow that the Great Dao,\nSerene and formless,\nDwelling in tranquility and emptiness,\nAbiding in clarity,\nMay

universally bestowed,\nNurturing growth.\nMay all things flourish,\nAnd the state’s stores and people’s wealth abound.\n\nNinth, we vow that the Five Peaks,\nEach secure in its place,\nTowering and vast in their embrace,\nMay long serve as palaces of immortals.\n\nTenth, we vow that the nation’s mandate be firmly secured,\nPreserving Heaven’s boundless end.\nMay all be guided and protected,\nNone who do not look up in reverence.\n\nEleventh, we vow that rivers and seas,\nVast and boundless,\nEmbrace and encompass all,\nNurturing even the smallest life.\nDeep and gentle, their kindness flows,\nMoistening all that wriggles and breathes.\nMay Heaven and humanity receive blessings,\nTheir years enduring like kalpas and stone.\n\nTwelfth, we vow that the Emperor’s reign,\nAnd the land’s prosperity, daily increase.\nMay the Four Guardians be at peace,\nWeapons of war never raised.\nMay Heaven and humanity sing in praise,\nAuspicious omens descend in flight.\nTeachings spread in abundance,\nVirtue and transformation overflow.\nMay the myriad people rejoice,\nTheir joy unending.\n\nThirteenth, we vow that all creatures,\nBorn or unborn, moving or still,\nMay universally receive safety,\nAnd attain life and growth.\nMay all behold the primordial qi,\nAnd receive the form of yang.\nMay grasses, trees, fruits, and forests,\nNot wither through winter.\nMay all be delivered and uplifted,\nNone that do not flourish in fresh glory.\nHarmony unites with the Dao in truth.\n\nMay the Fragrant Palace Attendants, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all spirit officials of the incense altar,\nCause this place where I establish the fast to naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs.\nMay the hundred spirits and host of Perfected gather here,\nBefore the incense burner.\nMay I, who study the Dao, attain the Dao;\nWho seek immortality, attain immortality.\nMay the fast’s sponsor receive blessings,\nAnd the hidden and manifest be graced with favor.\n\nMay the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions,\nAttending the orchid-scented smoke,\nConvey my recent petitions,\nSwiftly and directly to the presence of the Most High, Boundless, and Great Dao,\nThe Perfect and True Jade Sovereign of the August Heaven.\n\nThe thirty-fifth scroll of the *Ritual of the Yellow Register Fast of the Most High* concludes.\n\nThe Thirty-Sixth Scroll of the *Ritual of the Yellow Register Fast of the Most High*\nCompiled by Tang Dynasty Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting\n*Universal Salvation of Suffering Souls: The Evening Ritual Procession*\n\n**Entering the Chamber**\nEach bows to the master, contemplating as prescribed.\n\n**Invoking the Protective Spirits**\nThe Five Stars shine brightly, auspicious qi soars and drifts.\nThe Primordial Beginning gathers the spirits, heaven and earth unite in harmony.\nJade talismans and precious seals summon the hidden and obscure.\nFire is cast and might

mysterious transformation.\nWe give life to all beings, deliver the submerged and suffering.\nBy the grace of our masters, we bear the secret registers of the Three Clarities,\nReceive the profound decrees, and chant the true scriptures of the Three Caverns.\nRanked among the immortal grades, our names ascend the jade tablets.\nYet we have not yet refined our spirits to crystal bones,\nNor severed our traces to embrace the empty breast.\nVainly do we rely on the gate of the myriad wonders,\nOften transgressing the laws of the luminous perfected.\nOn the day we received the Dharma, we pledged our oaths to the Five Thearchs,\nVowed our vows to the Three Officials.\nTo deliver heaven and humanity, to magnify the state and family.\nFor every prayer and plea, it is fitting to make solemn declaration.\nToday, we present our earnest sincerity—how could it be suppressed?\nThe words we bear, how dare we not make known above?\n\n**Reading the Petition**\nAs the petition humbly states, it is fitting to deliver both the hidden and manifest.\nWe recall that the sponsor, [Name],\nThrough kalpas of accumulated merit and virtues surpassing the heavens,\nReveres the transformation of the spontaneous Dao,\nHonors the Primordial Venerable of the Boundless.\nAssists the state and guides the sovereign, cherishes kin and serves elders.\nEmbraces the profound intent of salvation and

the essence to enter immortality,\nThus forming the vajra body.\nTranscending the three realms’ tribulations,\nThe five hells’ sufferings dissolved.\nAll return to the Most High’s scriptures,\nIn silent contemplation, we bow in reverence.\n\n*Three Bows*\nWe, the assembly, with utmost sincerity bow in reverence to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao.\nWe, the assembly, with utmost sincerity bow in reverence to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, the assembly, with utmost sincerity bow in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.\n\n*Reiterating the Dharma Titles*\nWe, the disciples of the Supreme Mystery Capital, the Masters of [such-and-such] Peak, once more invoke:\nThe Most High, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Origin;\nThe Most High Jade Dawn Dao Lord;\nThe Most High Lord Lao;\nThe Ten Directions’ Most Perfect Great Sages;\nThe Supreme Heavenly Venerable;\nThe Heavenly Thearchs and Celestial Emperors;\nThe Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;\nThe Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center;\nThe responsive and perceptive deities of the three realms,\nAnd all true numina.\nWe, though humble and unworthy,\nHave been permitted to partake in the Great Dao.\nThrough the alliance of the Three Masters,\nAnd the true scriptures of the Three Treasures.\n\nWe offer reverent worship, seeking the fulfillment of our vows.\nBurdened by profound grace, our hearts swell with joy and trepidation.\nFrom the day we received the Dharma, we pledged to propagate the true teachings and deliver both the living and the departed.\nWhatever we present here is rightfully submitted for your consideration.\nThe officiant, disciple [Name], holds a position of weighty responsibility.\nAssisting the Dao in establishing merit, they magnify goodness and uphold the Dharma.\nYet we observe that in recent years, within these borders,\nthe people have suffered misfortune and calamity.\nThough there has been no drought or flood, the qi remains disordered.\nPoverty, sickness, and plague afflict the weak, leaving them starved and destitute.\nThe multitudes languish, stricken by unseen harm;\nthe trembling masses perish in distress.\nThus, bodies remain unpreserved, lives incomplete.\nThe old and young alike fall prey to illness, death heaped upon death.\nFor mortals in this world, life is but a fleeting moment—\nswift as lightning, rapid as the wind, scarcely held secure.\nThe causes of death are manifold:\nSome serve their lords with selfless devotion, repaying their sovereigns with loyalty,\ndying in battle, heedless of survival.\nOthers, driven by greed, perish in pursuit of wealth.\nSome chase fame and office, only to meet their end in the quest for glory.\nOthers, of cruel and deceitful nature,\nshow no kindness to creatures, no mercy to people.\nTheir hearts harbor perversity, their tempers flare unchecked.\nWhen illness strikes, none tend to them;\nonce afflicted, they swiftly succumb.\nOr, pressed by hunger and cold, assailed within and without,\nthey perish by the roadside, unclaimed by any.\nSome are dragged by swine or pulled by dogs;\nothers are gnawed by rats or devoured by insects,\ndying in torment on the road, their corpses filling ditches.\nSome lie exposed to wind and sun,\nwashed by rain, eroded by frost,\ntheir flesh unseen, their bones left bare.\nSome lack limbs, others lack heads or feet,\ntheir bodies scattered, a piteous sight.\nNow, we gather their remains, burying them together,\nregardless of gender or age.\nWe spare them from exposure, ensuring all are covered and concealed.\nMoreover, in the great teachings, compassion is fundamental.\nThe first duty is to shelter the dead, a principle that moves us to sorrow.\nThe sages of old, the Confucian masters, established rites:\nplanting pines upon burial mounds to guard against earth’s encroachment,\nburying bones and flesh to spare the living from lament.\nThus, they sought harmony for the living and safety for the dead.\nIs this fate’s decree, or the dictates of right principle?\nOur hearts ache with grief, our outward gaze brims with pity.\nTherefore, we come to this place, preparing the Daoist fast and offering.\nWe humbly present our repentance and gratitude, that it may ascend to the Thirty-Six Heavens;\nwe broadly proclaim our refuge, that it may resound through the Ten Directions.\nWe prostrate ourselves, beseeching the Perfected Sages and the Most High Venerables,\nto command the Offices of the Three Officials and Five Emperors,\nand proclaim to the Six Realms and Nine Dark Realms:\nbestow abundant grace, bring all to peace and stability.\nPardon the transgressions of the living and the dead,\nrelease them from the torments of judgment and suffering.\nBathe them in celestial blessings, cleanse the shades of the underworld.\nRefine and deliver their forms and souls, freeing them from sin and affliction.\nMay the living receive aid and protection;\nmay the dead attain rebirth.\nThe officiant, [Name], undertakes this burial,\ncreating a shared tomb for all.\nMay each rest in their proper place, all find their due.\nMay they swiftly attain rebirth, unobstructed by lingering ties.\n\nWe further pray for harmonious seasons and balanced qi,\nfor the prosperity of all beings and the peace of the age.\nMay the vast night realms ever offer the chance for redemption;\nmay the distant heavens fulfill the vow of tranquility.\nAbove, may the great compassion of the Heavenly Venerables be manifest;\nbelow, may our sincerity in devotion be answered.\n\nWe humbly submit this entreaty.\n\n**Vows**\nFirst, may the Great Dao spread far and wide, and all under heaven embrace its virtue.\nSecond, may all sentient beings awaken to the Dao.\nThird, may the souls of the Nine Nights be liberated at once.\nFourth, may the lonely and forsaken all find rebirth.\nFifth, may the world know peace and the five grains flourish.\nSixth, may ministers be loyal and children filial, rulers benevolent and fathers kind.\nSeventh, may the four seas unite, and enemies and kin be reconciled.\nEighth, may those in hidden wombs and eggs all be born and thrive.\nNinth, may chronic and acute illnesses swiftly heal.\nTenth, may the destitute and exposed be clothed and fed.\n\n**Replenishing the Incense Burner**\nIncense Officials, Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Attendant Spirit Officials,\nnow let golden elixir, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms naturally arise in this place of audience.\nMay the hosts of spirits and Perfected gather here before the incense burner.\nMay we who study the Dao attain the Dao, and those who seek immortality achieve it.\nMay the officiant gain blessings, and both the living and the dead receive grace.\nMay the jade maidens and immortal youths who attend the fragrant smoke\nconvey our entreaty swiftly to the presence of the Most High, Boundless Great Dao,\nthe Perfected Jade Thearch.\n\n**Exiting the Chamber**\nHere concludes the thirty-sixth scroll of the *Rites of the Yellow Register Fast of the Most High*.\n\n**The Thirty-Seventh Scroll of the *Rites of the Yellow

purge and purify.\nTo the left, the Central Yellow is invoked; to the right, the Six Dings are summoned.\nSeven revolutions, eight unions, circling the celestial scriptures.\nThe sagely transformation towers sublime, the Three Ways proceed in harmony.\nAuspicious clouds spread and diffuse, merging with the luminous Yellow Court.\n\n**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**\nThe Supreme

and humbly address the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin;\nthe Supreme Great Dao Lord; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao and the hosts of sagely and true virtues;\nthe Heavenly Worthies and Perfected Ones; the Great Thearchs and Heavenly Emperors; the Heavenly Master Lords;\nthe High Ministers and High Chancellors; the Four Offices and Five Emperors; the Thirty-Six Sections of Venerable Scriptures;\nthe Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; and all the honored spirits of the Three Realms’ official retinues.\n\nWe have gained access to the Dharma gate and participated in the cultivation of secret subtleties.\nThe jade caskets of treasure scrolls, the true instructions and numinous teachings—\nwe have been able to follow and practice them, widely propagating their divine transformations.\nProstrating, we trace the profound intent and rely upon the scriptures and diagrams.\nEstablishing teachings and founding merit, salvation of beings is the root.\nThus the Jade Dawn Great Sage, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy,\nhas extended the bridge of ten thousand practices and opened the eight gates of deliverance.\nThe departed souls of the Yellow Springs, the bound spirits of the endless night—\nthey are moistened by beneficent dew to become cool and refreshed, illumined by compassionate light to transcend and be saved.\nThough moved beyond measure of kalpas, all are preserved in safety.\n\nThe fast’s sponsor, so-and-so, grieves deeply for the departed soul and aspires to its deliverance and ascent.\nFearing that since its birth and from time without beginning,\nthe six desires and ten entanglements have indulged in transgressions and faults;\nthe six emotions and three karmas have accumulated offenses and errors through kalpas;\nunawakened to the true and correct, unaware of prohibitions and taboos;\nriding the wrong and treading the evil, day by day and month by month deepening the burden—\nit has offended the gods and spirits of Heaven and Earth, violated the offices of yin and yang.\nIts name is inscribed in the earthly registers, its soul imprisoned in the dark prison.\nIt does not behold the light, nor has it any means of deliverance.\nTherefore, binding the body and dedicating the life, it repents and confesses its faults and flaws.\nWe have arrayed the altar precincts, following the ritual codes and forms.\nSilk and ritual offerings, oil lamps, candles, incense, and flowers—\nearnestly and sincerely, we look up in hope of communion and response.\nProstrating, we implore the Perfected Ones and Lofty Sages, the honored spirits of the Ten Poles,\nto open boundless grace and descend the great compassionate blessings.\nWe pray that they command the flying divine persons of the ten-directional worlds,\nin accordance with the registers of the Three Scriptures, to proclaim the Nine Dragon Talismanic Mandates,\nopening and releasing the soul-spirits in Mount Tai, Fengdu, the Thirty-Six Prisons,\nand the Earth Offices of the Five Marchmounts.\nMay they dissolve and dispel the karmic adversities,\nemerge from the darkest depths, and enter the court of blessings and goodness.\nRefined by the Great Harmony, bathed in numinous blessings,\ntheir sins and evils are washed away, their forms and souls purified and tempered.\nThey bathe in the Palace of Cinnabar and Fire, pass through the Offices of the Yang Grottoes,\ndepart from sorrow and affliction, and behold and hear the Dharma sounds.\nMay they swiftly ascend the stages of the Dao, benefiting and pacifying the living.\nMay the entire household enjoy blessings, and the kinfolk be peaceful and secure.\nMay it extend universally to the hidden and manifest, broadly encompassing the moving and growing.\nTogether they may fear the wondrous joy and all accord with non-action.\nWhere the sagely power extends, all under Heaven are wholly saved.\nAbove, it manifests the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassionate blessings;\nbelow, it fulfills our repentance and confession.\nWe humbly make this known.\n\n**Invoking the Ten Thoughts**\nFirst thought: For the four great elements of the Dao, in harmony with the virtue of the fast’s sponsor,\nmay the seven generations of parents be spared from falling into sorrow and suffering,\nascend to the Heavenly Palace, and have clothing and food naturally provided.\n\nSecond thought: For the emperor and the lord of the state, may the Dao’s transformation flourish and prosper.\nMay the schools and academies be thriving, the imperial teachings vast and expansive.\nMay the majestic deportment be reverent and solemn, universally regarded by all under Heaven.\nMay the people praise the Great Peace, and the four barbarians submit in reverence.\nMay evil and perversity self-destruct, and sages and worthies naturally arise.\n\nThird thought: For the Dharma Master, may great merit be established.\nMay the teachings be clear and far-reaching, and all attain the flight of immortals.\n\nFourth thought: For fellow practitioners of the same aspiration,\nmay they swiftly attain the immortal Dao and mutually enlighten and deliver one another.\n\nFifth thought: For the nine relations to be harmonious, esteeming benevolence and righteousness.\nMay they honor the Dao and despise wealth, their conduct a model for all beings.\n\nSixth thought: For self-denial, bestowing alms upon Daoist masters and the hungry and cold.\nMay all the people under Heaven each attain their rightful place.\n\nSeventh thought: For the crawling and creeping, all sentient beings,\nmay they all receive accomplishment.\n\nEighth thought: For pardoning past lives’ karmic retributions in this present existence,\nmay they establish merit to compensate for transgressions.\n\nNinth thought: For the flourishing of the household,\nmay the ancestral temples have descendants, and worthy talents arise in every generation.\n\nTenth thought: For reverently receiving the scripture masters, never daring to slacken in equanimity,\nwith one mind broadly delivering all, may they swiftly attain the ascent to immortality.\nAscending to Heaven in broad daylight, they may pay homage to the Supreme.\nForever becoming perfected persons, riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages,\nharmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\n**Returning the Incense Burner**\n\nFragrant Official Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attendant Fragrant Spirits, may they cause this place of my audience with the Primordial to naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred numinous perfected beings gather here, assembling before the grotto’s incense burner. May they illumine my body with golden radiance, severing the roots of the womb’s bonds. May the Seven Mysteries be uprooted, and the hundred passages perfected in immortality. May the register of death be dissolved, and may I sit in repose at the Mud-Pill Palace. May the Eastern Florescence record my name, and may I be inscribed in the Register of the Void and Profound. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the incense smoke, conveying the words I have just uttered swiftly to the August Presence of the Supreme, the Boundless Dao, the Formless and Nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, before the Golden Portal and Jade Throne.\n\nThe thirty-seventh scroll of the *Yellow Register Retreat Rites* of the Supreme concludes here.\n\n**The thirty-eighth scroll of the *Yellow Register Retreat Rites* of the Supreme**\nCompiled by Master Du Guangting of Tang Guangcheng\n\n**Advancing and Withdrawing During the Procession of the Dao**\nEntering the chamber, each bows to the master and contemplates as prescribed.\n\n**Guardian Spirits**\nCinnabar numina and vermilion flames, blazing auroras and surging winds. The crimson wheel turns with刚 vigor, the celestial light radiating through the eight directions. Its might bursts forth, enveloping all, transforming myriad realms. Molten gold scatters and falls, while demonic hordes vanish without trace. It repels evil and shatters malevolence, illuminating the primordial merit. The golden talismans summon and command, treading clouds and spurring dragons. Songs of celebration resound, scattering flowers across the vast heavens. The numinous transformation operates in hidden motion, bringing peace and prosperity to the four extremities. Prostrating before the August Emperor, none dare be irreverent.\n\n**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**\nThe Supreme Mysterious Primordial Lord of the Dao summons forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Messengers, the Golden Youths of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmitted Words and Scattered Flowers, and the Fragrant Officials of the Five Emperors and the Direct Day, thirty-two each, to emerge. Those who emerge shall solemnly prepare and open the gates of the Mysterious Altar to the Celestial Divine Lords, and summon the local earth deities and true officials of this realm. As I now proceed with the Dao, I reverently memorialize the intent of this rite, praying that the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend and flow into my body. May what I have memorialized swiftly reach the August Presence of the Supreme, the Boundless Dao, the Void and Spontaneous, before the Golden Portal and Jade Throne.\n\n**Declaring Dharma Ranks**\nWe, your humble servants of such-and-such ranks, together with utmost sincerity, reverently memorialize the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Venerable, the Boundless Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Lord Lao, the August Jade Emperor on High, the perfected and sagely hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the Lords and Elders of the myriad true beings, the thirty-six Celestial Emperors, the Jade Clarity Supreme Emperor, the Great Emperor of the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numen, Northern Perfected, Mysterious Capital, Jade Metropolis, Golden Portal, Seven-Jewel Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity Supreme Palace, Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Lord of the Dao, the thirty-six revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, and all the true numina of the three realms’ official retinues. We, having long been favored by the mysterious destiny and gained access to the Dharma gate, have glimpsed the numinous chapters and followed the precepts and canons.\n\nMay we dwell in mountain vales and secluded grottoes, vanish our traces by numinous springs. Casting off the clamor of the dusty world, we refine ourselves in secret wonders. Yet the true and merciful nurture all beings as their first priority; the Great Dao delivers humanity by establishing merit as its foundation. Thus we humbly petition for salvation, universally extending to both the hidden and the manifest. Though the dead may plead for deliverance, their karmic bonds are not easily severed. Now, in accordance with the sacred decree, how dare we not make this known above?\n\nHaving recited the petition and verified its words, we find the supplicant’s aspiration lies in liberation and salvation. In this long night of the unseen, compassion and sorrow are our duty. We reflect that the Great Image divides its form to endow life and nurture essence. Riding harmony and yielding to fate, we embody earth and emulate heaven. Yet the void and purity are difficult to preserve, and the mechanisms of karma easily lead astray. Consciousness drifts with the dust, illusory realms shift and change. Transgressions and errors abound, the tally of sins is immeasurable. Sunk in the eternal night of the underworld, redemption seems impossible across countless kalpas. Only through devoted cultivation may we hope for ascent and deliverance.\n\nTherefore, we lay bare our hearts before the Three Caverns and surrender our lives to the hosts of heaven. The Yellow Register unfolds its rites of repentance and deliverance; the Mysterious Capital possesses the ranks for the transference of spirits. With utmost sincerity and purity, we seek to atone for our faults and transgressions. Each of us directs the cinnabar heart, praying for auspicious blessings.\n\nToday, at the midpoint of the ritual circuit, the assembly of Dharma practitioners raises the first incense offering. May the smoke of this incense ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits flow to the revered spirits of the state altars and the ancestral sages of our lineage. May they ascend and wander in the true realms, transcend and attain the ranks of immortality. May they feast in the Southern Palace and bestow blessings upon the Northern Gate. May the imperial destiny endure forever, the sagely lifespan extend boundlessly. May the sound of their teachings spread across the eight seas, uniting the chariots and writings of the ten thousand nations.\n\nNow, therefore, we kindle incense, taking refuge in the Great Sagely Host of Master and Honored Ones, whose virtue is most true. After attaining the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nAt this midpoint of the ritual, we, the assembly of the Dharma, raise the second incense offering. May the smoke of this incense ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.\n\nWe, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits flow to the patron of this retreat, the household of so-and-so.\n\nMay the nine generations and seven lineages, the myriad ancestors of countless generations, emerge from the realm of dark yin and ascend to the land of purity. May they receive blessings in the Vermilion Mound, refine their spirits in the Elixir of Cinnabar. May the departed souls and shadowed consciousnesses wash away their long-standing stains. May their names fall from the ledgers of sin and be inscribed in the Azure Palace. May they transcend the苦 realms, be released from the prisons of darkness. May they ascend to the Court of Eternal Joy and attain the fruit of non-action.\n\nNow, therefore, we kindle incense, taking refuge in the Great Sagely Host of Master and Honored Ones, whose virtue is most true. After attaining the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nAt this midpoint of the ritual, we, the assembly of the Dharma, raise the third incense offering. May the smoke of this incense ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters.\n\nWe, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits flow to the patron of this retreat, the household of so-and-so.\n\nMay their kin and karmic relations together partake in this sublime fortune. May their official emoluments endure and their lifespans extend, their sins be eradicated and their calamities dispelled. May this broadly extend to all beings, reaching even the most distant and conscious. May all together ascend to the realm of longevity and bathe in the mysterious compassion.\n\nNow, therefore, we kindle incense, taking refuge in the Great Sagely Host of Master and Honored Ones, whose virtue is most true. After attaining the Dao, they ascend into formlessness, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nThe rites are complete; we repent.\n\nLet each visualize the nine-hued perfect image, swallow the saliva, and intone the secret incantation to command demons. Stepping into the void, circling and revolving—\nour cloud-steps ascend the celestial net,\nwhere the heavenly winds blow with a sudden rush.\nRobes flutter, brushing the Dipper’s handle;\nwe hold jade tablets and bow to the Banner of Three Stars.\nLions bear vermilion tassels in their jaws,\nwhile qilin lead jade-green chariots.\nIn flight we traverse the eight directions,\nhow often have we seen spring branches bloom?\nDark locks rise beneath scarlet headbands,\nazure mists weave through feathered robes.\nAt dawn we hasten to the Palace of Yang Virtue,\nby night we arrive at the Moon’s Radiant Gate.\nWe grasp and play with the fires of the celestial sphere,\nthen conceal and withdraw like Lu Ji’s steed.\nThe Jade Chamber cannot retain us—\nwe soar back toward the ninefold heavens.\nWater is sprayed to subdue demonic palaces,\nlamps are lit to illuminate the nocturnal courts.\nThe winds of the nine heavens fall silent,\nthe qi of the four poles clarifies.\nWe chant and sing in the Vermilion Mound,\nsoaring through the White Jade Capital.\nHow shall we offer our utmost sincerity?\nMay the nation’s blessings endure in eternal peace.\n\nThreefold prostration:\nWe, your servants, reverently bow our heads to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao.\nWe, your servants, reverently bow our heads to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, reverently bow our heads to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\nReaffirming the sacred ranks:\nWe, your humble servant so-and-so, now respectfully readdress and supplicate the Most High, Boundless Great Dao, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the boundless hosts of Dao and virtue in the ten directions; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; the High Ministers and Prime Officers, the Four Administrations and Five Emperors, and all divine officials and numinous beings of the Three Realms.\n\nWe have heard that the Most Sagely One, in compassion, opened the eight gates to deliver the suffering; the true scriptures unfolded transformations, spreading the Three Caverns to ferry humankind. Their grace extends to the hidden and the manifest, their blessings pervade heaven and earth. Having encountered this decree, we now exhaust our sincerity, establishing merit to propagate the Dao and uphold its luminous teachings.\n\nThe patron of this retreat, so-and-so, for the sake of the departed soul—whose form was shaped in remote antiquity, whose qi was received from the primordial heavens—from beginningless time until this day, has followed the turning of karmic conditions, deluded within the dream-realm. The six senses stirred dust, the ten fetters obscured the nature. Easily were sins born, swiftly did transgressions accumulate. Some offenses violated the true numina, others transgressed prohibitions and taboos, offending the heavenly Dao above and disrupting the earthly shades below. There were instances of intentional killing or accidental harm, greed for wealth that harmed righteousness. They lacked the virtue of compassion and yielding, disrupted the harmony of ritual and music. They encroached upon and harmed living beings, damaged and destroyed creatures’ lives. Their sins bound the courts of the Three Officials, their names filled the registers of the Five Emperors. Since the body’s dissolution, they have faced karmic retribution—some detained in the dark prisons, others adrift in alien destinies. Endlessly they wander in the long night, with no means of deliverance.\n\nThus, we gather our hearts in prayer, pouring out our pleas to heaven. We present patterned silks to fulfill the rites of supplication, prepare dragon-brocade tokens to convey the pledges for the soul’s ascent. We kindle the Nine Dark Lamps to illuminate the long night, perform the rites to the ten directions’ sagely titles to open the path through dense darkness. Above, we report to the various heavens; below, we notify the various earths, extending to the realms of the Five Peaks and Fengdu, the paths of the three evil destinies and six destinies. May the dew of compassion quench their scorching toil, may the winds of mercy dispel their burning afflictions. May enmities be reconciled, debts and disputes resolved. May the black ledgers on Mount Fengdu be burned, the red records on the Southern Culmen inscribed. May a thousand transgressions and ten thousand errors all be expunged. May they be refined in the Court of Flowing Fire, their souls purified in the Palace of Lesser Yin. Ascending to the ranks of immortals, they shall ride the celestial thoroughfares. Thus, may the Three Luminaries shine upon the Two Modes, may the Five Weapons be sheathed and the Hundred Grains flourish. May the celestial mandate abound, the sagely lifespan extend. May the dragon spirits endure, secretly aiding wind and rain. May all living beings be harmoniously nurtured, all in the patron’s household—living and deceased—receive blessings, their kin prosper. May the dark courts and nether ferries together attain true fruition. Above, may this manifest the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy; below, may it fulfill our devotion in taking refuge.\n\nRespectfully submitted for your attention.\n\nVows:\nFirst vow: May the Great Dao abide in tranquil emptiness, at ease in stillness and void, dwelling in clarity.

May the Four Guardians remain in harmony, weapons of war never raised. May heaven and humanity sing in praise, auspicious omens descending in flight.

May all behold the primordial qi, receiving the forms of yang. May grasses, trees, fruits, and forests endure winter without withering. May all be universally delivered, none failing to flourish in radiant glory. In harmony, they unite with the true Dao.\n\nAgain, to the Fragrance Officials, Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all the attendant spirit officials of the incense altar: May this place where I perform the Dao naturally generate liquid-gold elixirs, cinnabar, and jade mushrooms. May the hosts of a hundred spirits and perfected beings gather here before the incense altar and brazier. May I, in studying the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the rising incense, swiftly conveying the words I have just uttered directly to the Jade Emperor’s court of the Supreme Non-Ultimate Great Dao, the Void and Spontaneous.\n\nExiting the chamber—*The Thirty-Eighth Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast Rites* concludes.\n\n**The Thirty-Ninth Scroll of the Supreme

this servant has declared swiftly reach the Jade Emperor’s court of the Supreme Non-Ultimate Great Dao, the Void and Spontaneous.\n\n**Each States Their Dharma Rank**\nThe humble servant [Name], in

Ministers;\nthe Four Offices and Five Emperors;\nthe thirty-six revered scriptures;\nthe Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;\nand all responsive and perceptive numinous spirits of the three

and phoenix-writ,\ncelestial chapters and jade precepts—\nall have we received and pledged to uphold.\nYet we have not hidden in secluded forests,\nnor dwelled in realms beyond the world,\naspiring to ascend on high,\nrenouncing the dusty realm.\nInstead, we drift with the mundane,\nmingling with the common throng.\nTransgressions accumulate unceasingly,\ndevotion falters in constancy.\nStill, we strive to propagate the teachings’ rites,\nto expound the wondrous instructions,\nto ferry beings and deliver creatures,\nto aid the state and establish merit.\nWe offer our sincere devotion,\nhoping to assist the mysterious transformation,\nthat all may enter the Dharma-gate,\nopening blessings for the living and the dead,\nsafeguarding the hidden and the manifest.\n\nNow, the patron of this

evils and three karmic deeds\nplant the roots of sin.\nIndulging desire, unrestrained,\nthey wallow in excess.\nSome angle in rivers or hunt at night,\nburn forests or drain mountains.\nSome impose unjust punishments,\ninflicting harm against reason.\nSome, as ministers, are disloyal;\nsome defile the Three Luminaries,\ncursing thunder and rain.\nSome disrespect heaven and earth,\nfearing no divine judgment.\nThe sins they commit\nare beyond measure.\nSome bear unresolved grudges,\nunsettled debts from past lives.\nUnresolved retributions,\ndeep afflictions unrepented—\nafter death, they drift into the Three Offices,\nenduring agony,\ntheir souls imprisoned in darkness.\nBeneath the Yellow Springs,\nwithin hell’s depths,\nthey sink into eternal night,\nthe path of life severed.\nFor eons, they suffer,\nwith no means of deliverance.\nSome endure confinement,\nsome face interrogation and torture.\nThey bear mountains, haul stones,\ndraw from the boundless sea.\nDriven by lightning, chased by thunder,\nthey toil without rest.\nIn darkness, they receive their due—\nwhen will they return?\nWithout the Great Dao’s mercy,\nthe Heavenly Worthy’s compassion,\nthis torment would know no end,\nno path to repentance and liberation.\n\nNow, with a single thought of utmost sincerity,\nwe purify our hearts and turn toward the Dao.\nMay all boundless suffering\nbe pardoned and absolved.\nWe humbly pray that the departed,\nthrough countless kalpas and generations,\nmay receive this sublime merit,\nall ascending to heaven.\nMay their tombs remain secure,\nlawsuits cease.\nMay

Lingbao Perfected Sovereign of Luminous Augustness,\nthe thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures,\nthe Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,\nand all the true spirits of the three realms’ officialdom.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves and recall:\nwhen the great transformation first divided,\nall beings received their endowment.\nYin and yang rise and fall,\ndetermining life and death;\nrewards and punishments, seen and unseen,\nmanifest sin and fortune.\nFrom ancient times to the present, nothing has erred;\ngreat and small alike are justly measured.\nThe supreme Dao proclaims its compassionate salvific decrees,\nwhile the Lingbao scriptures prescribe rites of repentance and prayer.\nRelying on this retreat’s offerings,\nwe seek to deliver the dim and benighted.\nHaving been entrusted with this office,\nwe have glimpsed the profound mysteries.\nWhatever we now declare,\nhow dare we not make known above?\n\n*Reading the Petition*\nAs the words of the petition state, we devote ourselves deeply to cultivation and reverence.\n\nWe turn our thoughts to the myriad generations of ancestors—both inner and outer kin—and to all departed spirits, bound through kalpas past. Some bear sins beyond absolution, grievous transgressions without measure, knotted fast and never undone. They may dwell in the ten directions of the cosmos, within the Five Peaks or the Nine Netherworlds, or under the governance of the Water Palace or Earth Bureau, confined in the dark courts of night, where wretched souls and suffering shades are held fast in the depths of the Yellow Springs. There, they endure the torments of water, fire, wind, and blade, day and night, their forms and spirits broken, their pain unbearable. Their afflictions extend to descendants, calamity flowing to later generations. In the endless dark of the netherworld, there is no path to liberation. Following the scriptural ordinances, we humbly seek their deliverance. Through the earnest observance of this retreat and the rites of repentance, we beseech mercy, offering our sincere devotion and praying for the gaze of the Mysterious One.\n\nAt this moment, as [Name] conducts the ritual and the assembly of the dharma invokes the first offering of incense, may this fragrant smoke ascend directly to honor the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves in reverence, and turn in devotion to the Three Supreme Ones. May the merit of this act flow to [Name]’s family—thirty-six generations, nine ancestors, seven lineages—and to all departed spirits and hidden souls. May the radiance of the divine descend to illuminate the ninefold darkness, and may the power of the Dao suffuse all, ending the trials in every prison. May enmities dissolve, sins be absolved, souls bathed in the Pool of Flowing Fire, and rebirth granted within the Palace of Southern Florescence. May celestial robes adorn their forms and the dew of wisdom purify their hearts. May they forever sever evil ties and forever ascend to the realm of blessings.\n\nNow, as incense is kindled, we take refuge in the great sagely assembly, the perfected virtues of the Most High, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the realm of Non-Action, harmonizing with the True Dao.\n\nAs [Name] conducts the ritual and the assembly of the dharma invokes the second offering of incense, may this fragrant smoke ascend directly to honor the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves in reverence, and turn in devotion to the Three Supreme Ones. May the merit of this act flow to the state, to the august rites of the Nine Temples, and to the ancestral sages of the imperial line. May their spirits gather in the Crimson Towers, bestowing blessings upon the grand design. May the emperor’s virtue align with the Three Absences, his benevolence spread to the Nine Realms. May the realm enjoy peace, wind and rain be harmonious. May his reign surpass that of the Zhou in longevity, and his transformative influence shine as brightly as the Han’s. May weapons remain sheathed, and all within the four seas thrive in tranquility.\n\nNow, as incense is kindled, we take refuge in the great sagely assembly, the perfected virtues of the Most High, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the realm of Non-Action, harmonizing with the True Dao.\n\nAs [Name] conducts the ritual and the assembly of the dharma invokes the third offering of incense, may this fragrant smoke ascend directly to honor the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves in reverence, and turn in devotion to the Three Supreme Ones. May the merit of this act bring fortune to [Name]’s family, that they may forever enjoy blessings and auspiciousness, all attaining purity and good fortune. May disasters vanish before they arise, sins be extinguished without limit. May the nine clans and six relations together receive the mysterious protection. Extending to all beings—whether soaring or creeping, animate or inanimate, sentient or insentient—and to those in the dark paths of hell, the four modes of birth, and the six destinies, may the wind of the Dao spread afar, and the sagely grace suffuse all. May all awaken to Non-Action and ascend through every rank.\n\nNow, as incense is kindled, we take refuge in the great sagely assembly, the perfected virtues of the Most High, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the realm of Non-Action, harmonizing with the True Dao.\n\nThe rites are now complete.\n\nTo the East, we wholeheartedly take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao of the East, the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Celestial Elder, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Eastern Realm. With three bows, we reverently repent and offer thanks. After this repentance, we now kindle incense, dedicating it to so-and-so’s establishment of the wondrous retreat for the *Lingbao* Rite of Deliverance from Torment, wherein we recite scriptures and perform the Dao-circumambulation, repenting for the boundless sins of our countless ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations—and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.\n\nThese sins may include: straying from the true Dao, flattery and deceit without end; envy of the worthy and capable, defiling and disrupting the divine Dao; cruelty and violence without measure, slaughter driven by whim; betrayal of oaths and covenants, plotting with curses and hexes. Such transgressions have congealed and accumulated like mountains, their weight crushing, their punishments profound. Yet they remain unforgiven. The souls of the guilty are seized and struck, confined within the Wooden Bureau’s Eastern Peak’s Punishment and Torture Prison, subjected to the torments of copper pillars, iron beds, and golden hammers. Day and night, they endure agony, their suffering unrelenting, their rest and sustenance denied. They afflict the living with lawsuits, pleading for deliverance. Yet in the endless dark of night, no release is found.\n\nNow, through this Dao-circumambulation and retreat, we pray for mercy and repentance to cleanse these sins. We humbly implore the great compassion to grant forgiveness, the power of the Dao to bestow its light. May a decree descend within the Eastern Bureau, at the gates of the Torture Office. May the torments of the living and dead be dissolved, their souls delivered and uplifted, receiving blessings in the Heavenly Halls. May the living ascend to the divine realms above, and the dark and light realms alike know peace. Bearing the mysterious grace, having attained the Dao, may they ascend into Non-Action, harmonizing with the True Dao.\n\nTo the South, we wholeheartedly take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao of the South, the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Celestial Elder, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Southern Realm. With three bows, we reverently repent and offer thanks. We now kindle incense, dedicating it to so-and-so’s establishment of the wondrous retreat for the *Lingbao* Rite of Deliverance from Torment, wherein we recite scriptures and perform the Dao-circumambulation, repenting for the boundless sins of our countless ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations, nine lineages, and seven branches—and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.\n\nThese sins may include: inflicting cruelty and harm at will, slaughtering the innocent; breaking oaths and covenants, casting hexes upon beings.\n\nIndulging in depravity and wantonness, violating and oppressing the chaste and upright. Defying the steps of goodness, creating sinful karma. Offending Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, and all divine spirits. Their punishments are severe, their calamities profound, yet they have not received pardon. Their souls are seized and struck, confined within the Fire Bureau’s Southern Marchmount’s Punishment-Pounding Hell, enduring the torment of furnace and charcoal, scorched and broken by cruel punishments. Day and night, they are tortured and flogged, their pain and poison unbearable. The misfortune extends to their descendants, flowing endlessly without cease. In the boundless dark of the long night, there is no means of deliverance. Today, through repentance and the washing of hearts, through the establishment of the retreat and the performance of the Dao-circumambulation, we humbly implore the Three Worthies to witness and protect, the Great Saints to bestow compassion. We beseech the Fire Bureau of the Southern Palace and the wardens of the Punishment-Pounding Gate to absolve their accumulated sins and release the imprisoned souls. May they emerge from the Hell of Mount Huo, reborn within the Crimson Palace of Cavernous Yang. May their descendants receive blessings, forever bearing the grace of the divine. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into Non-Action, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\nTo the West,\nwe take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao of the West, the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Celestial Elder, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Western Realm. With three bows, we reverently repent and offer thanks. We now kindle incense, dedicating it to so-and-so’s establishment of the wondrous retreat for the *Lingbao* Rite of Deliverance from Torment, wherein we recite scriptures and perform the Dao-circumambulation, repenting for the boundless sins of our countless ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations—and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.\n\nThese sins may include: acting contrary to kindness and nurture, lacking benevolence and humanity, lacking loyalty and filial piety. Harming the good and upright, offending and defying the divine spirits.\n\nViolating the Five Constants, indulging in all manner of evil. Engaging in curses and malevolent prayers, committing wanton and groundless acts. Their transgressions are grave, their calamities profound, yet they have not received absolution. Their souls and spirits are bound and confined within the Golden Bureau’s Hua Mountain Grinding Prison, enduring the torments of sword trees, blade mountains, and the sufferings of wind and thunder. Day and night, they are tortured and afflicted, their pain and poison unrelenting. Their grievances entangle their descendants, their misfortunes flowing into the present. In the endless darkness of the long night, there is no means of deliverance. Today, through repentance and supplication for mercy, we establish the wondrous retreat and perform the Dao-circumambulation. We humbly beseech the Great Compassion to bestow nurturing grace, that the myriad sages may turn their radiant light. We implore that a decree be issued within the Western Bureau, beneath the gates of the Grinding Officials. May the imprisoned and suffering be delivered, their souls and spirits absolved. May they be entrusted to the divine courtyards, reborn in the Pure Realms. May the living enjoy peace and prosperity, forever bearing the profound favor. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into non-action, harmonizing with the Dao and uniting with the True.\n\nTo the North:\nWith utmost sincerity, we reverently submit ourselves to the Boundless Great Dao of the North, the Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Celestial Elder, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Northern Realm. With three bows, we reverently repent and offer thanks. We now kindle incense, dedicating it to so-and-so’s establishment of the wondrous retreat for the *Lingbao* Rite of Deliverance from Torment, wherein we recite scriptures and perform the Dao-circumambulation, repenting for the boundless sins of our countless ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations—and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.\n\nThese sins may include: defying the heavenly Dao above, offending the earthly authorities below. Defiling the Three Luminaries, belittling the Four Great Elements. Harboring resentment against wind and rain, enlisting ghosts and spirits. Casting curses and hexes upon others, inflicting harm upon living beings. Their souls and spirits are arraigned and confined within the Water Bureau’s Zhen Mountain Grinding Prison, enduring the sufferings of freezing ice, nightly courts, and icy rivers. Their flesh and skin split from the cold, their pain and poison unbearable. They entreat the living, seeking deliverance and salvation. In the endless darkness of the long night, there is no means of release.\n\nWith this present Dao-procession and fast, we reverently confess and repent. We humbly beseech the Heavenly Honored and Great Sage to bestow boundless grace. May proclamation be issued within the Northern Bureau, beneath the gates of the Judgment Officers. May their offenses be pardoned, their suffering souls delivered and uplifted. May they depart the long night’s icy courts, escape the Three Paths and Five Sufferings. May they ascend to the Pure Realm, receiving blessings and protection for the living. May their clans and kin find peace, the living and dead alike prosper. Having fulfilled these vows, we look up in gratitude for the mysterious favor. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the realm of Non-Action, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with truth.\n\nIn the northeast direction, we, your servants, wholeheartedly submit and entrust ourselves to the Boundless Great Dao of the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the northeast quarter. We perform the Three Bows, each with reverent confession and repentance.\n\nWe now burn incense and dedicate this Numinous Treasure Expiation Fast for Deliverance from Judgment, reciting scriptures and performing the Dao-procession, confessing the boundless sins of our ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations—and all departed spirits, whether living or dead.\n\nThese sins may include: as children, failing in filial piety; as subjects, failing in loyalty; as fathers, lacking compassion; as rulers, lacking the Way. Envying the worthy, resenting the good, forsaking uprightness to embrace perversity.\n\nWords at odds with the heart, self-deception before one’s own form and shadow. The Five Heinous Crimes committed in full, every evil act performed. Wrongfully harming the innocent, unjustly killing without cause. From life to death, grievances pierce the heavens above. Cursing the divine, invoking malevolent spells, resorting to sorcery and witchcraft. Calamity deep and transgressions grave—condemned to the Earth Bureau’s Lower Yuan, within the crushing prisons of judgment. Tortures of ten thousand kinds, body and soul broken and withered. In the endless dark of night, no means of deliverance to be found.\n\nNow, in repentance we beg for mercy, establishing this fast and performing the Dao-procession. We prostrate ourselves, hoping the Ten Heavens will grant pardon, the Three Saints bestow grace. May a decree descend to the Earthly Mansion, to the gates of the Judgment Officials. May karmic retribution be dissolved, souls and spirits absolved. Freed from the realm of bondage, released from the suffering of heavy fetters. Bathed in the divine cinnabar and radiant fire, ascending the Scarlet Mound. Litigation forever dispelled, descendants at peace and prosperous. The living and the dead alike share in this blessing, looking up to receive the profound grace. After attaining the Dao, we ascend into the realm of Non-Action.\n\nIn harmony with the Dao, united with true reality.\n\nSoutheast Quarter\nWe, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao of the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the southeast quarter.

Disrupting the proper order of kinship, suppressing the orphaned and weak. Scheming through unrighteous means, slandering sages and worthies. Undermining others’ accomplishments, envying those who surpass oneself. Inflicting harm and killing without just cause, acting wantonly as one pleases. Invoking Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and stars as witnesses—such sins run deep, and their retribution is severe. The souls are cast into the prisons of the Earth Bureau, where they endure the torments of water, fire, wind, and blade, day and night, without respite. The punishments are meted out in succession, with no means of deliverance.\n\nNow, through this repentance and expiation, we perform the fast and Dao-procession. We prostrate ourselves in hope that the Perfected Saints of the Ten Directions and the August Lords of the Five Quarters will decree to the prisons of the southeast quarter, to the courts of the Judgment Officials, that the imprisoned souls be redeemed, their forms and spirits cleansed. May their accumulated sins be absolved, their long-standing calamities eradicated. May the living be guided onto the path of blessedness, receiving protection and favor.

boundless grace.\nAfter attaining the Dao, we shall ascend into the realm of Non-Action,\nharmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.\n\nTo the Ten Directions, we wholeheartedly submit and entrust ourselves:\nTo the Perfected Great Sages of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao,\nto the Most True Lords and Venerable Masters,\nto the Divine Immortals of the Ten Lands and all spirit-officials—\nwe offer the Three Bows, each with utmost sincerity, confessing and giving thanks.\n\nWe, the assembled, dedicate body and spirit, submitting ourselves in devotion.\nNow, by burning incense and performing the Dao-procession,\nwe establish the Supreme Lingbao Fast of Deliverance from Punishment for so-and-so,\nconfessing the boundless sins of our ancestors—extending to thirty-six generations—\nand all departed spirits, whether living or dead.\nSome have offended the Great Sages of the Heavens, the Host of the Great Dao,\nthe Three Luminaries and Five Phases, the Sacred Host of the Void,\nthe spirits of wind, clouds, thunder, and rain, and all divine beings.\nSome have violated the Five Peaks and myriad mountains, the Thirty-Six Earths,\nthe hills and water palaces, the officials of the underworld.\nSome have defied sages and worthies, transgressed against benevolence and righteousness.\nSome have desecrated ancient and modern sacred sites, contravened the Four Great Elements and Five Constants.\nEach action has bound karmic causes, each has incurred retribution.\nThe Ten Evils have been fully committed, the Five Heinous Crimes repeatedly performed.\nIn life, no virtuous deeds; in death, only evil consequences.\nSunk in the Five Sufferings, dragged through the Three Wretched Paths.\nExiled souls endure hard labor, never granted pardon.\n\nNow, by establishing this fast and performing the Dao-procession, we confess and uproot the roots of sin.\nWe humbly implore the Three Supreme Ones to open the streams of great compassion,\nto send down the Mandate of the Nine Dragons.\nWe proclaim to all realms and the infernal courts of the judges:\nRelease the souls from eternal night.\nBathe them in the Crimson Mound’s courts, clothe them in the robes of the Cavern Yang’s palace.\nLet them be born on the shores of blessed fortune, bestowing grace upon descendants.\nMay auspicious blessings draw near, the living and dead dwell in peace.\nShould our plea be granted, we shall look up in profound gratitude for mysterious grace.\nAfter attaining the Dao, we shall ascend into the realm of Non-Action,\nharmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.\n\nEach shall meditate on the Nine-Colored Perfect Image,\nswallow the saliva, recite the secret demon-subduing incantation,\npace the void, circumambulate.\nThe Supreme Ultimate divides into height and depth,\nthe light and pure ascend to belong to Heaven.\n\nOne who cultivates the Perfect Dao,\nthe body becomes a true immortal.\nTheir deeds surpass the three thousand,\ntheir time spans forty thousand years.\nThe cinnabar terrace opens its treasure scrolls,\nthe golden mouth transmits the flow.\nThe Great Brahmā, Lord of the Three Heavens,\nthe Void Sovereign, the Five Venerable Ones—\neven they cannot fathom its subtlety,\nhow then could it be captured in words?\nThe jeweled throne descends in the golden hall,\nthe rosy coronet illumines the jade pavilion.\nMyriad perfected ones pay homage at the imperial court,\ntheir flying sandals treading the roots of clouds.\nThe melodies of Hua and Xia resound afar,\nthe cadence of human voices rises and falls.\nIn emptiness they return to virtue and power,\ntheir turns and twists harmonizing with the celestial tones.\nThe halls are steeped in sandalwood’s fragrance,\nthe towers cool beneath the moon’s dew.\nHow shall utmost sincerity be offered in prayer?\nMay the harvests forever flourish in abundance.\n\n**Threefold Reverence**\nWe, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,\nbowing to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.\nWe, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,\nbowing to the thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity,\nbowing to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\n**Reaffirming the Dharma Titles**\nWe, your humble servants, [names], reverently reaffirm our sincerity and humbly address the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, the Most High Dao Lord, and the Most High Lord Lao.\nWe, of lowly and insignificant station,\nhave received and upheld the precepts and ordinances.\nFollowing the sacred decree,\nour duty lies in delivering sentient beings.\nWe rescue and liberate the living and the dead,\nthat all may dwell in peace.\nWhatever we declare,\nwe dare not withhold from your august hearing.\n\nNow, there is [name], an official and devout believer,\nwho lays bare his sincerity and reveals his earnest plea.\nHe requests to perform a fast and vigil,\nto repent of sins and beseech grace.\nIn accordance with the canons and ritual forms,\nwe have examined the mystic protocols.\nWe have heard that when ancestors do good,\nblessings extend to their descendants;\nwhen they do evil,\ncalamities flow to later generations.\nThe retribution of sin and fortune\nfollows like a shadow.\nWithout thorough repentance and prayer,\nthere is no means of cleansing.\n\nThe nine generations and seven ancestors of [name]’s family,\nthe recently departed and those long gone—\nthrough countless kalpas,\nthey may have committed various transgressions:\nviolating the one hundred eighty prohibitions of the Three Primes,\nor the fourteen categories of offenses in the Jade Treasury,\narising from the six senses,\nthe three karmas,\nthe ten evils,\nand myriad wrongs,\nall accumulated in the nether courts.\n\nPerhaps their eyes were ensnared by the five colors,\nunable to perceive the true and real;\ntheir ears clung to the five sounds,\nunable to hear the supreme principle;\ntheir mouths craved the five flavors,\nconsuming and harming life;\ntheir bodies were bound by the five entanglements,\ntainted by desire and harming their nature.\n\nPerhaps they offended the celestial Dao above,\nviolating the sun, moon, and stars;\nor transgressed against the earthly darkness below,\nand the mountains, rivers, hills, and temples;\nor disrupted human affairs in the middle,\nundermining the harmony of benevolence and righteousness.\n\nAs children and subjects, they were disloyal and unfilial;\nas rulers and fathers, they were unprincipled and unkind.\nTheir words belied their hearts,\nthey envied the worthy and resented the good.\nThey harmed others and seized their possessions,\nbullied the orphaned and impoverished.\nThey estranged kin and befriended the distant,\nrevered the perverse and turned from the upright.\nThey exploited wealth and usurped merit,\ndrained marshes and burned forests,\nangled for the hidden and shot the roosting.\nThey flew hawks and coursed hounds,\nslaughtering without end.\n\nOr perhaps they caused strife among the nine clans,\nviolence among the six relations.\nTheir words lacked propriety and deference,\ntheir actions were always invasive and deceitful.\nAs officials, they coveted wealth,\noppressed their superiors and tyrannized their subordinates,\nseeking prestige through cruelty.\nThey flogged the innocent,\nexecuted the guiltless.\n\nOr they made oaths and curses,\ninvoking gods and spirits;\nor undertook construction projects,\ndamaging graves and temples.\nThey followed their whims and indulged their desires,\nentangling themselves in deep sin and calamity.\nTheir souls are bound to the three paths,\nconfined in eternal night.\nThey endure a thousand torments and ten thousand trials,\ntheir suffering spanning countless kalpas.\nThe distant heavens are dim,\nthe bridge of the Dharma broken.\nThe dark hells below offer no escape,\nthus bringing misfortune upon the living\nand disasters upon their descendants.\nTheir endeavors falter,\ntheir movements meet with misfortune.\n\nNow, we pour out our hearts in earnest plea,\nreturning in repentance and prayer.\nWe implore the Three Treasures,\nprostrating before all the heavens.\nWe humbly beseech the Great Sage to bestow mercy,\nto universally grant pardon and forgiveness.\nMay the edict be issued to the Four Controllers, the Five Emperors,\nand the mighty deities of the Three Realms,\nto proclaim below to the Nine Dark Realms of the netherworld,\nthe judges and their subordinates,\nto absolve and pardon the countless ancestors and myriad souls.\nRelease their sins and remove their transgressions,\nreconcile grievances and dissolve faults.\nOpen the heavy prisons and dark dungeons,\nliberate the suffering souls.\nThe sword trees lose their blades,\nthe knife mountains lay down their edges.\nThe frigid realms and eternal night\nare filled with light.\nTheir refined essences ascend to the Southern Cinnabar,\ntheir spirits rise to the Azure Vault.\nThey roam the Eight Scenic Realms,\nride the Ten Heavens.\nThe officials of the netherworld are promoted to Great Perfected,\nsoaring to the Golden Gates.\nThe calamities of [name]’s family cease,\nblessings and grace draw near.\nThey ascend the steps of longevity and fortune,\nenjoying the rewards of peace and integrity.\n\nMay all sentient beings of the four births and six destinies,\nthe conscious and the feeling,\nthrough this merit,\ntogether ascend the shore of the Dao.\nMay the three luminaries shine in mystery,\nthe six qi harmonize.\nMay the imperial reign be long,\nand the world dwell in peace.\nAbove, may the great compassion of the Celestial Venerable be manifest;\nbelow, may the sincerity of our repentance be answered.\n\n**Vows**\nFirst, may heaven and earth be bright and pure.\nSecond, may the atmosphere be clear and mysterious.\nThird, may the sage enjoy ten thousand years of life.\nFourth, may transformation extend to the eight limits.\nFifth, may sweet dew descend from heaven.\nSixth, may the earth emit auspicious vapors.\nSeventh, may the four seasons follow their course.\nEighth, may all things grow in perfection.\nNinth, may families abound in filial piety and fraternal love.\nTenth, may the nation flourish with talent and virtue.\nEleventh, may the officiating officials obtain blessings.\nTwelfth, may those who study the Dao attain immortality.\n\n**Reactivating the Incense Burner**\nIncense Official Messengers,\nLeft and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,\nAttendant Spirit Officials of the Incense—\nmay this place where we offer incense\nnaturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms.\nMay the hundred spirits and myriad perfected ones\ngather here before the incense burner.\nMay we who study the Dao attain the Dao,\nthose who seek immortality become immortals.\nMay the officiant receive blessings,\nthe living and the dead partake in grace.\nMay the words we have declared\nswiftly reach the august presence of the Supreme Boundless Great Dao,\nthe Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning,\nin the Golden Gates and Jade Palace of the Void and Spontaneity.\n\n**Verbal Petition**\nWe, your humble servants [names],\nprostrate and humbly address the Supreme Boundless Great Dao,\nthe Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning,\nthe Most High Great Dao Lord,\nthe Most High Lord Lao,\nthe thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures,\nthe Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm,\nand all the spirit officials of

the [day] of the [month],\nfor [name], on account of [matter],\nwe have conducted the Great Fast of the Numinous Treasure for Liberation from Torment,\nrepenting for the living and the dead,\ndissolving grievances and torments.\n\n**Incense Offering and Lamp Lighting**\nWe kindle incense and light lamps,\nilluminating all heavens.\nWe chant the numinous sounds,\ncircumambulate in the Dao, and perform rites of repentance.\nWe liberate the bound spirits of countless generations of ancestors,\nthe imprisoned and exiled souls of the condemned.\nWe beseech deliverance from the Ten Sufferings and Eight Adversities,\nguiding them to plant the roots of faith.\nFor so many days, so many nights,\nwe have circumambulated and recited the scriptures.\n\nNow that the merit is complete and the affairs concluded,\nwe reverently dismantle the fast’s altar.\nWe summon the divine hosts—\nthe cavalry and mounts,\nthe spirit officials of the Numinous Treasure,\nthe inspectors and guardians of the fast,\nand all those who diligently monitored and protected the rites—\nto ascend to the True Palaces,\nto be promoted as superior immortals,\nand to receive ranks among the celestial hierarchy.\n\nMay we, your servants,\nhaving fulfilled our merit and completed our practices,\nascend in radiance to the Nine Heavens.\nMay the sun and moon shine together,\nmay the Three Treasures gleam as one.\nWe humbly implore the Most High Saints\nto witness and reflect upon our sincere hearts.\n\nShould we, your servants,\nin our movements or pauses,\nhave transgressed the statutes or

humble servants, [names],\nof [prefecture], [county], [abbey],\nrespectfully address\nthe Supreme Lord of the Great Dao of the Three Heavens of Primordial Beginning,\nthe Most High Lord Lao,\nthe Celestial Venerable,\nthe Heavenly Thearch,\nthe Nine Elder Immortal Lords of the Grotto-Heavens,\nthe Ninefold Qi Venerable,\nthe myriad layers of Dao-qi,\nthe Twelve Hundred Official Lords,\nand the Jade Sovereign of the Great Clarity.\n\nOn the [day] of the [month] in the year of [cyclical sign],\nat [location],\nwe humbly submit this petition.\n\nUpon the conclusion of the rites,\nwe dismiss the Three Masters and others,\nin accordance with the Numinous Treasure liturgy.\n\nIf the circumambulation spans only a single session,\nno prior petition is required.\nIf it extends for a day and two nights or longer,\nthen, following the Numinous Treasure statutes,\npetition the fast’s officers,\nproclaim the prohibitions,\nand expound the precepts.\nAfter the merit-recitation,\nrestore the precepts and resume duties.\nAll matters must be conducted strictly according to the rites,\nwithout careless deviation.\n\n**End of Scroll Forty of the *Yellow Register Fast Rites***\n**Beginning of Scroll Forty-One of the *Yellow Register Fast Rites***\n\n**Collected by Master Du Guangting of the Tang Dynasty**\n\n**On Repentance**\n\nTo conduct the Dao and establish the fast, order is fundamental. Even slight disorder disrupts the proper form. When perception falters, ritual deportment and musical offerings falter in their reverence. Not only does this invite censure from the celestial courts, but it also risks ridicule from fellow practitioners.\n\nShould wind and rain approach during rites at the open altar, or in the swelter of summer or the biting cold of winter; if dawn or dusk arrives untimely, or unexpected disturbances arise—halting the proceedings abruptly would cause panic and disorder, while adhering strictly to the statutes would delay and inconvenience. In such cases, the chief cantor may lead the assembly in *stepping the void* before the altar, invoking the divine. If the disturbance is severe, simplify the rites to their essence: the *Three Petitions* and *Great Thanksgiving* will suffice. Adapt to the moment, lest rigidity become one’s undoing.\n\n**Twenty Directions’ General Repentance**\n\nThe assembled officers face north as the chief cantor intones:\n*\"We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Ten Poles’ Heavenly Lords, the Three Luminaries and Five Peaks, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Sacred Scriptures, and all divine immortals and spirit-officials.\"*\n\nAfter bowing, each repents with reverence. As the cantor invokes each direction, all bow once:\n*\"We humbly recall: the Dao acts through non-action, and virtue governs without dominion. It encompasses the myriad dharmas as the greatest within the realm and spans the nine schools to open the gate of all mysteries. The principles of good and evil are distinct, and the statutes of sin and blessing clearly manifest. Thus, the Vermilion Register of the Southern Palace records ascent as the reward for goodness, while the Black Book of the Northern Bureau inscribes death as the reckoning for transgression. These serve to punish and encourage, rescuing the benighted. Only after clarifying the origins of the teaching can one align with the intent of non-action.*\n\n*Now, on behalf of the sponsor of this Great Yellow Register Fast, the official [Name], who cherishes loyalty and filial piety, and whose gratitude to sovereign and kin runs deep, we initiate this rite of incense and devotion to repay the kindness of nurture. With fragrant offerings, ritual gifts, dragon-jade, and patterned silks, we take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the perfected deities of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the True Lords of the Sacred Mountains and Grotto-Heavens, the Five Peaks, the Water Palaces’ revered spirits, the Three Treasures’ officials, the Ten Directions and Three Realms, and all true numina. We beseech the grace of celebration and bestowal, the descent of great compassion’s blessings.*\n\n*May the sponsor’s [Name] household—ancestors of a hundred thousand generations, the wandering souls in the cold courts of eternal night—all be liberated. May the three affinal and five consanguineous kin, all relations and dependents, have their misfortunes erased from the Nine Yin and their blessings born in the Three Luminaries. May calamities cease, and longevity extend. May the Emperor’s sagacity surpass that of Fuxi and Shennong, his years equaling heaven and earth. May the Crown Prince and regional lords long assist in this flourishing era. May the Empress, consorts, and concubines forever uphold the sacred enterprise. May the myriad officials and feudal lords devote themselves to its support. May the four seas and ten thousand lands be transformed by unified culture. May weapons fall silent and wind and rain follow their course. May the sun and moon retain their purity, and the stars their proper motion. May Fengdu’s judgments be stayed, and all creatures dwell in safety. May we all embody the lineage of clarity and stillness, and together realize the Dao of the subtle and formless. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\"*\n\n**Twenty Directions’ Sequential Repentance**\n\nThe assembled officers move left, stand facing east, and the chief cantor intones:\n*\"We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Eastern Direction’s Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Eastern Realm.\"*\n\nAfter bowing, each repents with reverence.\n*\"Eastern Direction...\"*\n\nWe, your humble servants, have heard that when the Lesser Yang establishes its position, it first opens the Azure Vault’s palace; when the virtue of Wood governs the direction, it unfolds the Blue Origin’s precinct. Issuing the spring mandate, all blossoms receive their beginning; emerging from the domain of Zhen, the imperial enterprise endures in prosperity. We should rely upon the nurturing benevolence of the Dao and exhaust our sincerest devotion in refuge.\n\nNow, with reverence, we present the chief patron of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, so-and-so, who bears the virtue of life-bestowing grace and feels the profound favor of Heaven and Earth’s shelter. In gratitude for past transgressions and to beseech blessings, he has established this retreat and practiced the Dao. We humbly offer a bolt of blue-green silk and a golden dragon, dedicating them to the Eastern Direction’s Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Eastern Realm.\n\nWe reflect that when the supreme Dao flows forth its compassion, all blossoms find peace; when the warmth of Yang spreads its transformation, all creatures shine in harmony. First, we pray for the extension of the imperial destiny and the well-being of the sagely person. Beyond the Fusang and Penglai Isles, may the world’s chariots share a single track; in the lands of Dongming and Sushen, may auspicious tributes be offered. Next, for the chief patron’s nine generations of lingering attachments, whose transgressions are recorded in the ledgers of Mount Tai, and for his five clans of kin, whose names are inscribed among the immortals of the Eastern Dipper: may misfortunes cease, and the span of fortune and longevity be prolonged. May past faults dissolve of themselves, and blessings of goodness gather abundantly. May all beings, seen and unseen, together bathe in the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\n**Southern Direction**\n\nWe, your humble servants, have heard that when the Vermilion Heaven first opens, crimson clouds gather in the courtyard of flowing fire; when the Red Emperor establishes his capital, the scarlet qi solemnly adorns the palace of radiant rosy clouds. Spreading the numinous Yang to illumine the nine provinces, proclaiming the virtue of Fire to shine upon the depths of darkness, we rely upon the benevolence of nurturing growth and should offer our most earnest prayers.\n\nNow, with reverence, we present the chief patron of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, so-and-so, who contemplates the welfare of both family and state, extending to ruler and kin. In gratitude for past transgressions and to beseech blessings, he has established this retreat and practiced the Dao. We humbly offer a bolt of crimson silk and a golden dragon, dedicating them to the Southern Direction’s Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Three Qi Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Southern Realm.\n\nWe reflect that when the virtue of Yang shines its illumination, no darkness remains unlit; when the supreme truth responds to beings, every feeling finds its answer. First, we pray for the sagely person’s supreme fortune and the flourishing of the great enterprise. May the red crow manifest its auspiciousness, and the vermilion phoenix arrive in ceremony. May border cities know no alarms of beacon fires, and distant lands present tribute by land and sea. Next, for the chief patron’s household—his nine generations and seven ancestors refining their essences in the Vermilion Mound, and his five clans and six relations whose names are inscribed on the cinnabar registers—may misfortunes cease, and past faults dissolve of themselves. May the span of fortune and longevity be prolonged, and blessings of goodness gather abundantly. May all creatures, sentient and insentient, together bathe in the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\n**Western Direction**\n\nWe, your humble servants, have heard that the Great Emperor of the Golden Direction governs the jade towers to unfold the celestial plan, and the Heavenly Lord of Pristine Virtue resides in the gem-studded palace to expound the teachings. The rightmost reaches command the floating peaks of Mount Fu Luo, while the Western March divides the Supreme Wondrous Capital. We revere the majesty of autumn’s stern power, the hope of all creation.\n\nNow, with utmost reverence, the chief patron of this grand Yellow Register Retreat, so-and-so, holds profound devotion to family and state, and weighty duty to sovereign and kin. To atone for transgressions and pray for blessings, he has established this retreat and practiced the Dao. We humbly present a bolt of plain-woven silk and a golden dragon, dedicating them to the Limitless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Western Direction, the Heavenly Lords of the Seven Qi, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Western Quarter.\n\nWe note that the jade tablets have set forth the law, with deliverance as their foremost principle, and the golden perfection flows forth in grace, with nurturing compassion as its essence. First, we pray for blessings upon the sagely court, preserving the peace of the imperial throne. May the jade-sealed celestial records extend the imperial enterprise without end, and the white phoenix and pale unicorn manifest auspicious omens for eternity. Next, for the chief patron’s household—his nine generations of departed souls ascending to the hidden palaces of mystery, and his living kin whose names are inscribed in the Western Na’s realm—may disasters vanish before they arise, and new blessings descend. May all beings, moving and still, receive grace, and both the living and the dead know peace. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\n**Northern Direction**\n\nWe, your humble servants, have heard that the fivefold qi, swirling and coalescing, congeals into the vastness of the Guanghan Palace, and the boundless yin, vast and distant, shapes the silent realm. Manifesting singular virtue to succor the ten thousand regions, and spreading supreme goodness to unfold the myriad wonders, we rely upon the mysterious transformation and present the sincerity of this retreat.\n\nNow, with utmost reverence, the chief patron of this grand Yellow Register Retreat, so-and-so, holds weighty duty to sovereign and kin, and profound devotion to family and state. To establish this retreat, practice the Dao, atone for transgressions, and pray for blessings, we humbly present a bolt of dark-woven silk and a golden dragon, dedicating them to the Limitless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northern Direction, the Heavenly Lords of the Five Qi, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Northern Quarter.\n\nWe note that the mysterious virtue is impartial, circulating through the myriad lands, and its supreme merit extends afar, nurturing the six voids. We pray first that the sagely plan be upheld and the celestial longevity prolonged, as boundless as the deep sea and as enduring as the Northern Culmen. Next, for the chief patron’s household—his nine ancestors and seven departed kin—may they forever depart the dark prisons, leave the borders of Feng Du, and ascend to the vast palaces of the boundless. May his living kin be recorded in the mysterious registers. May calamities be eradicated and past faults silently dissolve. May fortune and longevity be renewed, and blessings and good fortune gather abundantly. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\n**Northeastern Direction**\n\n**Northeastern Direction**\n\nWe prostrate ourselves and hear: the verdant peaks of Mount Gen rise in emerald splendor, its flowing waters carrying the lingering ripples of Kan; the celestial vault floats in azure clarity, where the auspicious qi of Zhen Wood first stirs. Here, the supreme transformation is exalted in the realm of primordial vastness, and the divine breeze is fanned within the Purple Ultimate’s court. We gaze upward to the sagely virtue that brings forth life, awaiting the divine work that opens deliverance.\n\nNow, the chief patron of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, so-and-so, holds foremost the state and family, extending to lord and kin. In repentance of transgressions and prayer for blessings, he establishes this retreat and practices the Dao. With reverence, he presents one bolt of yellow-patterned silk and one golden dragon, dedicating them to the Boundless Supreme Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Qi of Brahma Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Northeastern Quarter.\n\nWe humbly observe: as harmonious warmth spreads, all beings—whether soaring or sinking—attain peace. The true essence moves alone, and numinous transformation knows no bounds. First, we pray that blessings extend to the ancestral line, aligning with the Two Modes to secure the altars of state; that the sagely sovereign’s glory be transmitted, equaling the Two Luminaries to illumine the ten thousand regions. Next, for the chief patron’s household—his nine generations and seven departed kin—may they shed their forms in the realm of empty song; may his six relations and five clans inscribe their names in the Palace of Bright Valley. May his lifespan be prolonged within, and calamities cease without. May the hidden and manifest rejoice together, and all creatures partake in glory. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\n**Southeastern Direction**\n\nWe prostrate ourselves and hear: beneath the cinnabar towers, the qi of Brahma coalesces to form palaces; within the crimson courtyards, the winds of Xun stir to nurture all things. Here, the hundred valleys pay homage as to their source, and the three mountains display wondrous transformations. The permeating virtue knows no bounds, matching the mysterious work that does not act.\n\nNow, the chief patron of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, so-and-so, holds deep loyalty to state and family, and profound duty to lord and kin. In repentance of transgressions and prayer for blessings, he establishes this retreat and practices the Dao. With reverence, he presents one bolt of yellow-patterned silk and one golden dragon, dedicating them to the Boundless Supreme Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Qi of Brahma Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Southeastern Quarter.\n\nWe humbly observe: the great Dao’s vast compassion spreads its grace universally. It condenses the utmost truth to descend and aid, bestowing numinous blessings without omission.\n\nWe now humbly pray that the patron’s grand destiny of supreme fortune may rival the boundless vastness of the ocean’s depths, and that his sacred longevity may equal the towering heights of Penglai’s immortal peaks. May his nine generations of ancestors, their divine forms released, be freed from the dark gates of the earthly realm; and may his living kin, their names inscribed in the celestial registers, stand among the ranks of immortals. May past transgressions dissolve of themselves, and misfortunes forever cease. Before calamity even stirs, let blessings descend anew. May all living beings, both moving and still, universally receive the shelter of the Dao’s shade. After attaining the Way, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with true reality.\n\nTo the Southwest, we, your servants, humbly observe: the two symbols divide their numinous power, weaving the hidden mechanisms of the Kun wilds; the doubled yin settles into its place, condensing utmost stillness at the earth’s axis. Facing the sun’s domain, it asserts its might; controlling the moon’s gate, it establishes its pole. All creatures draw sustenance from it to grow and flourish, while the myriad dharmas embody it to attain stillness and peace.\n\nNow, the chief patron of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, so-and-so, for state and family, establishes this retreat and practices the Dao. With reverence, he presents one bolt of yellow-patterned silk and one golden dragon, dedicating them to the Boundless Supreme Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southwest, the Qi of Brahma Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Southwestern Quarter.\n\nWe humbly observe: though the most sagely and exalted perfected ones elude pursuit, the treasury of blessings they bestow responds unfailingly to sincere prayer and devotion.\n\nWe humbly beseech the sacred chart of blessings to safeguard the great enterprise, that the Nine Enclosures be serene and still, the Six Harmonies flourish in peace.\n\nNext, we pray for the retreat’s patron, so-and-so’s household: may the nine generations and seven lineages be freed from the earthly bureau’s ledgers of judgment; may the bound spirits and stagnant consciousnesses wander freely upon the cloud-sands’ path. May the living kin be inscribed in the immortal registry; may calamities and declines cease, and official emoluments and lifespan be prolonged. May all living beings share equally in blessings and protection. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the true.\n\nIn the Northwestern Quarter:\nWe humbly observe: the Jade Emperor, his crown pendants congealed in stillness, governs from the Heavenly Gate to spread transformation; the Golden Numinous One, dwelling in his celestial seat, encompasses the Qian and Lu hexagrams to lay the foundation. The host of stars hangs the pattern of the Pole Star’s reverence, while the myriad phenomena embody the movement of primal flourishing. Truly, they oversee transgressions and blessings, governing all living beings.\n\nNow, the chief patron of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, so-and-so, burdened with profound gratitude for sovereign and kin, and deep sincerity for family and state, establishes this retreat to practice the Dao, repenting transgressions and praying for blessings. With reverence, he presents one bolt of yellow-patterned silk and one golden dragon, dedicating them to the Boundless Supreme Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest, the Qi of Brahma Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Northwestern Quarter.\n\nWe humbly note: the Dao of Heaven shines brightly, circulating without cease. The numinous immortals, in hidden assistance, bestow their protection without omission.\n\nMay it specially beseech the sagely court above to consolidate the myriad achievements, perpetuate the imperial enterprise, and eternally bring about harmonious prosperity. May it further beseech that the household of Retreat Patron so-and-so—across nine generations and seven mysteries, with the six relations’ lingering attachments—find their spirits dwelling in Kunlun and Penglai, their steps soaring through mist and clouds. May their present clan and kin know no calamity or decline, their emoluments endure and lives lengthen, misfortune vanish and blessings arise. May all creatures possessing consciousness be preserved in primordial auspiciousness. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the true.\n\nAbove, we humbly note: the singular qi surges and merges, circulating through the Great Void to form images; the Two Modes shine resplendently, opening the vast expanse without bound. The five hundred million heavens are divided, the three thousand realms arrayed. Wind and thunder, cold and heat—how can one speak of their equal distribution across the four seasons? Solemnity and growth, killing and creation—all follow the Six Voids yet remain ungoverned. Now, the chief patron of this Yellow Register Grand Retreat, so-and-so, bearing the vast encompassing compassion and moved by the virtue of nurturing completion, establishes this retreat to practice the Dao, repenting transgressions and praying for blessings. With reverence, he presents one bolt of azure-patterned silk and one golden dragon, dedicating them to the Boundless Supreme Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Lords, the Perfected of Jade Capital and Mystic Capital’s Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, the divine immortals and jade maidens, and the spirit officials of the Upper Realm’s boundless worlds.

Through them, the animate and inanimate are distinguished, and all living beings receive their allotment.\n\nWith reverence, we, the sponsors of this Yellow Register Grand Fast, having received the grace of their illumination, now offer our utmost sincerity in repayment.

Mindful of the dust and defilement that may offend the true numina, we humbly seek to confess our faults from the outset, praying for your blessing and protection.\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, we ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the True.\n\n**Western Marchmount**\nWe humbly acknowledge that autumn in the west embodies the flourishing power of metal, and Mount Hua’s towering heights rise to boundless grandeur. Its cliffs, carved as if by blade, soar ten thousand ren. Clusters of lotus blossoms cling to the void at the summit of emerald mists; the immortal’s palm cradles the sun amid the white clouds. With utmost sincerity, we, the sponsors of this Yellow Register Grand Fast, now invoke the August Sovereign of Mount Hua, the White Emperor of the Western Marchmount, and the divine immortals and spirit officials. Mindful of the dust and defilement that may offend the true numina, we humbly seek to confess our faults from the outset, praying for your blessing and protection.\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, one ascends into formlessness,\nHarmonizing with the Dao to merge with the True.\n\n**Northern Marchmount**\nWe humbly acknowledge that the north embodies the flourishing power of water, and Mount Heng stands as guardian of that quarter. It overlooks the precarious realm of Xu and Wei, spanning the vast wilds of You and Ji. A thousand cliffs vie in their soaring heights, exhaling clouds and rain into the misty void; ten thousand ravines race in their descent, harboring ethereal mists in lush verdancy. With utmost sincerity, we, the sponsors of this Yellow Register Grand Fast, now invoke the August Sovereign of Mount Heng, the Black Emperor of the Northern Marchmount, and the divine immortals and spirit officials.

Above, it aligns with the celestial pole; below, it guards the mighty capital. In its orientation, cloud-wreathed ravines unfold in a thousand layers; in its sheer ascent, mist-veiled peaks rise ten thousand zhang. With utmost sincerity, we, the sponsors of this Yellow Register Grand Fast, now invoke the August Sovereign of Mount Song, the Yellow Emperor of the Central Marchmount, and the divine immortals and spirit officials.

Their unfathomable waves race onward, their boundless vastness knows no shore. Leviathans and whales find their swimming grounds, tortoises and dragons their hidden lairs. They stir the tides to follow yin’s ebb and harm, they raise mists and clouds to aid heaven and earth. Their power to moisten below is most expansive, their virtue of supreme goodness is where all归. With utmost sincerity, we, the sponsors of this Yellow Register Grand Fast, now invoke the August Sovereign of the Water Palace, the Great Emperor of Fusang, the Divine King of Yang Valley, the Water Emperors of the Three Rivers and Four Plums, the Nine Jiang, the Twelve River Sources, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Water Palace.

Golden writings and jade characters, phoenix scripts and dragon seals. Sacred registers and numinous diagrams, divine formulas and secret incantations. Cultivate them, and one easily transforms the mortal heart to ascend the sagely Dao; practice them, and one discards worldly filth to tread the cloud thoroughfares. The precepts and laws are strict and clear, not bestowed upon the unworthy. With utmost sincerity, we, the sponsors of this Yellow Register Fast, now invoke the Most High and Venerable, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Revered Scriptures, the True Writings and Sacred Talismans, the Secret Treasures of the Myriad Heavens, the Orthodox Dharma of the Ten Directions, the Guardian Deities of the Scriptures, and all numinous officials. Fearful of transgressions against the true Dao in past lives and the present, we humbly beseech the sweeping away of our boundless sins.\n\nMay the myriad sages bestow auspicious omens, and the thousand perfected confer blessings. The living and the dead alike shall prosper, their emoluments and longevity extended. Through nine nights and three paths, all shall partake of the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless. Harmony unites with the Dao in truth.\n\n*The Forty-Second Scroll of the Most High Yellow Register Fast Rites* concludes.\n*The Forty-Third Scroll of the Most High Yellow Register Fast Rites*\nCompiled by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting\n\n*Rites of Repentance to the Five Directions for Disaster Relief Among Officials and Commoners*\nWhen ascending the altar during extreme cold, intense heat, or sudden wind and rain, lest one’s demeanor be improper or actions hasty, this repentance rite may be employed for simplicity and essentials.\n\n**First, Pay Homage to the Directions**\nWe, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions’ Boundless Realms, the Great Sage Hosts Who Have Attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters, and the Divine Officials of the Ten Realms’ Immortal Lands.\n*Three prostrations, each with reverent repentance.*\n\n**Next, the Repentance**\nWe humbly recall that the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Poles recline in effortless majesty above the Void of Non-Being, while the Five Elder Thearchs unfurl their charts within the Great Desert. They propagate the Dao and virtue to transform all regions, and dispense kindness and compassion to govern all beings. Whatever is entreated, they unfailingly respond.\nNow, we, the sponsors of this grand Yellow Register Fast, certain officials and persons, bear profound gratitude for ruler and kin, and deep loyalty to family and state. To honor blessings and prosperity, we have established this altar and precinct. Following the prescribed rites and presenting the ritual offerings, we take refuge in the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions’ Boundless Realms, the Great Sage Hosts Who Have Attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters, and the Divine Officials of the Ten Realms’ Immortal Lands.\nWe specially beseech the bestowal of their ungoverning benevolence and the diffusion of their impartial grace. May auspicious omens descend upon the ancestral temples and the imperial line’s fortune be prolonged.

May the five clans and six relations be inscribed upon the cinnabar tablets. May a thousand disasters cease, and a hundred blessings be renewed.

The Three Luminaries bestow their radiance, and all beings take form. The Solar Emperor and Lunar Sovereign oversee the registers of life and death, while the Stellar Palaces and Dipper Pivot jointly govern the records of sin and fortune.\nNow, we, the sponsors of this grand Yellow Register Fast, certain officials and persons, with utmost sincerity take refuge in the Perfected Great Sages of the Sun, Moon, and Stellar Palaces, and the Divine Officials of the Three Luminaries’ Immortal Hosts.\nWe specially beseech the bestowal of their great abundance and the diffusion of their impartial virtue.

Below, they stabilize the earth; above, they support the celestial canopy. The sacred mountains and numinous grottoes govern spirits and gods. The underworld bureaus and immortal courts administer sin and fortune.\nNow, we, the sponsors of this grand Yellow Register Fast, certain officials and persons, with utmost sincerity take refuge in the True Lords of the Five Peaks, and the Divine Officials of the Grotto-Heavens and Sacred Mountains Who Have Attained the Dao.\nWe specially beseech their illumination of our sincere devotion and the descent of vast blessings. First, may the imperial destiny be strengthened and the imperial plan secretly protected. May the phoenix’s reign endure for myriad millennia, and the crane’s years equal those of Mount Song and Mount Hua.\nNext, may the nine generations and seven ancestors of the sponsor’s family, whose consciousness lingers in dark prisons, have their records expunged from Mount Tai’s ledgers and find the path to freedom in the immortal grottoes. May the living kin—both inner and outer relations—have their emoluments and longevity increased, and misfortunes and disasters eradicated. May their sinful records be stricken from the Five Peaks, and their names inscribed in the immortal registers of the Nine Heavens. May all moving and quiescent beings together attain liberation.\nAfter attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless. Harmony unites with the Dao in truth.\n\n**The Water Realms**\nWe, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Great Emperor of Fusang, the Divine King of Yang Valley, the Water Emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Jiang, and the Divine Officials of the Twelve River Sources’ Water Realms.\n*Three prostrations, each with reverent repentance and gratitude.*\n\nWe humbly recall that the Eight Seas support the heavens, floating the Ten Continents beyond the world, while the Nine Jiang harness the sun, dividing the Six Directions within the earthly realm. The cosmos relies on their power of conveyance, and all beings depend on their nurturing virtue. They conceal grotto-heavens within, governing all living beings. Having charge over the sources of sin and fortune, they should be entreated with utmost devotion.\nNow, we, the sponsors of this grand Yellow Register Fast, certain officials and persons, with utmost sincerity take refuge in the Great Emperor of Fusang, the Divine King of Yang Valley, the Water Emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Jiang, and the Divine Officials of the Twelve River Sources’ Water Realms.\nWe specially beseech the unfolding of their supreme benevolence and the diffusion of their numinous and enduring grace.

First transmitted in the heavens, they gradually descended to the human realm. There are charts for attaining long life and immortality, and instructions for benefiting beings and pacifying the people. Emperors and kings have revered them to propagate transformation; perfected scholars have cultivated them to ascend to heaven. They are the root-source of the ten thousand methods and the fundamental origin of the nine schools. It is fitting to receive and uphold them, that auspicious blessings may descend.\n\nNow, with utmost sincerity, we, the sponsors of this Great Register Retreat, the officials of such-and-such rank, take refuge in the Thirty-Six Divisions of Revered Scriptures and the True Writings and Sacred Talismans. We specially beseech the opening of great mercy and the bestowal of boundless fortune. May the sacred destiny be eternally upheld, and the grand design subtly assisted. May the ninefold palace enjoy the peace of seas and mountains, and the myriad states be harmonized under the transforming power of unified culture.\n\nWe further beseech that the three masters and nine generations of ancestors of the sponsor’s family be inscribed with virtuous names on the cinnabar registers, and that the living kin be cleansed of their transgressions recorded in the black books. May secret instructions be secretly transmitted, and the immortal ranks be silently attained. May emolument and longevity be renewed, and misfortunes and calamities forever cease. May all beings, whether soaring or sinking, plant or animal, together bathe in the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless. Harmony unites with the Dao in truth.\n\n*Here ends Scroll Forty-Three of the Rituals of the Great Register Retreat of the Most High*\n*Scroll Forty-Four of the Rituals of the Great Register Retreat of the Most High, compiled by Master Du Guangting of the Tang*\n\n**Rite for Pacifying the Dwelling and Circulating the Dao**\n\nThe assembled officials first take their positions before the Mysterious Master and stand in formation. They chant the *Dao*, enter the chamber, and circumambulate, beginning with the offering of incense to the Five Directions in the east. They then present incense at the imperial altar and at their respective stations, each bowing to the Master while visualizing as prescribed.\n\n*Guardian Spirits*, radiant and luminous at dawn,\nPurple mists ascend through empty space.\nStellar altars gleam resplendent,\nTransforming into cloud-palaces.\nThe solar essence and lunar spirit,\nWinged between *Li* and *Kan*.\nGolden Perfected issue their commands,\nDragons and tigers dispel Fengdu’s shades.\nOn this auspicious day, the rite proceeds,\nEight Mighty Ones drum in attendance.\nJade blossoms unfold, rainbow banners swirl,\nHeavenly light descends, the Dao’s *qi* flourishes.\nAll beings receive universal deliverance,\nJoy flows without end.\n\n**Twenty-four strikes of the ritual drum.**\n\nO Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, Three *Qi* of the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao: Summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendant Officials of Left and Right, the Incense-Bearing Golden Youth, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maiden, and the Thirty-Two Fragrant Officials of the Five Thearchs and the Direct Day. Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn attire, to open the gates of the Mysterious Altar and invoke the Celestial Lords and Divine Sovereigns. May the deities of this land and its boundaries, the true officials and upright spirits, attend in mind.\n\nWe pray that the wondrous light of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-*qi* and Numinous Treasure descend and flow into our bodies, that our petitions swiftly ascend to the presence of the Supreme, Boundless, and Great Dao—before the Jade Threshold of the Formless and Spontaneous Golden Gate.\n\n**Each declares their ritual rank:**\n\nWe, your humble servants, in unison and sincerity, reverently address the Formless and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Boundless Great Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of the August Heaven, the Great Sage Assemblies and Perfected Lords of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords, the Jade Clarity Emperor, the Great Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, the Seven Jeweled Mysterious Terrace of the Jade Capital and Golden Gates in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Numinous Treasure Perfected Sovereign of Luminous Augustness, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the officials of the Three Realms, the Perfected Immortals of the Grotto-Heavens, the Five Primordial Thearchs, the Numinous Treasure’s Mighty Spirits, and all true numina above and below.\n\nWe have heard that the Great Dao fuses with the true, and the Primordial August One governs the course of destiny. The Five Scriptures unfold the teachings, and the Three Caverns proclaim their practice. The Heavenly Worthy bestows the ordinances of boundless deliverance; the Supreme One spreads limitless grace. All beings are shaped and refined, all lives rescued and uplifted. We, having accumulated good causes over countless kalpas, have been bathed in the mysterious transformation. Dragon scripts and phoenix records, jade tablets and jasper scrolls—we have been privileged to receive and cultivate them, seeking ascent and deliverance. Yet at the outset of our vows, we pledge salvation as our foremost duty. No petition may be withheld or denied. How much more so when commanded by sacred decree—dare we not make this known above?\n\n**The petition is read.**\n\nAs the words express, our sincerity is earnest and our devotion profound. It is fitting that deliverance be granted, that the mysterious compassion be fulfilled.\n\nWe reflect that before the Five Ultimates, the Three Spirits divided their transformations. In the lower antiquity, customs remained uncorrupted. Dwellings were carved into cliffs and nests built in trees; all embraced the Dao and held fast to virtue. Each found contentment in their place, harmonizing in effortless non-action. But when the myriad signs of yin and yang appeared, and the symbols of beams and rafters arose, fortune and misfortune, good and evil, intertwined in mutual succession. Those who followed the natural order enjoyed generations of blessings; those who defied it suffered calamities and afflictions. The sages, moved by compassion, made salvation their heart’s work. Through repentance of sins and prayer for grace, they exalted the rectitude of the retreat. We now humbly join together, adhering to the canonical rites. We establish the altar and seek blessings and protection.\n\nToday, as we proceed with the rite, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend through the void, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full submission, reverently relying on the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow to the august spirits of the altars of state and the ancestral shrines. May the Celestial Capital gleam with radiant purity, and the Purple Culmen extend its blessings. May fortune grace the imperial residence, and felicity transmit the imperial enterprise. May it stand as firm as Mount Song and Mount Heng, and shine as brightly as the sun and moon. May the Crown Prince and the various princes inherit and uphold the sagely enterprise. May worthy ministers and good counselors ably assist in planning and strategy. May the myriad states come as if by bridge and boat, and all beings enjoy peace and prosperity.\n\nFor this purpose, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assemblies, the virtues of the Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao in truth.\n\nToday, as we proceed with the rite, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend through the void, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full submission, reverently relying on the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow to the nine ancestors and seven generations of the sponsor’s family, and to the departed spirits in the hidden realms. May they dwell in the Crimson Garden and refine their souls on the Cinnabar Terrace. May they don the *qi* of immortality and ascend to the cloudy peaks, entrusting themselves to transformation. May fortune bless their descendants, and grace extend to both the living and the dead. May they ever bear the mysterious felicity and constantly receive primal auspiciousness.\n\nFor this purpose, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assemblies, the virtues of the Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao in truth.\n\nToday, as we proceed with the rite, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the third pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend through the void, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full submission, reverently relying on the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow to the sponsor’s household, their kin and relatives, bringing them shared blessings. May their fortune extend and their lives endure; may misfortunes vanish and calamities dissolve. May the dragon spirits of the dwelling, the yin and yang officers, and the terrestrial officials receive promotions in rank and rewards for merit, their titles and honors augmented. May they bring auspicious protection to the central palace and dispel disasters and misfortunes from the outer realms.\n\nNow, therefore, we kindle incense and take refuge in the Great Sage Assembly of Masters, whose supreme virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into formlessness. Harmony unites with the true Dao.\n\n**Ritual Orientation**\nWith utmost sincerity, we prostrate ourselves and submit our lives to the Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the East, the Azure Emperor of the Nine Qi Celestial Lord, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the eastern quarter. Thrice we bow, each time offering reverent repentance and gratitude. Hereafter, follow this pattern for each direction.\n\n**Repentance**\n**East**\nWe, your servants, offer this rite on behalf of the sponsor, so-and-so, humbly giving thanks to the Boundless Supreme Perfected Azure Emperor of the Nine Qi of the East, the Seven Star Lords of the Azure Dragon and Eastern Dipper—Horn, Neck, Root, Chamber, Heart, Tail, and Winnowing Basket—the Wood Virtue Deities of Jia-Yi and Yin-Mao, the Lesser Yang Qi of the Nine Yi Elder Lord, the Spring Sovereign Gou Mang of Grand White, and the Stellar Officials of Jupiter, the Wood Palace.\n\nWe reflect with awe that the dwelling place may have offended or transgressed against the divine, violated prohibitions, and thereby invited misfortune.

May all inauspicious spirits be dispelled.\n\nShould there be any quarrying of timber or moving of stones, any groundbreaking or construction that offends the true spirits of heaven and earth, disrupts the true qi of yin and yang, encroaches upon the Earthly Mansion, or violates the numinous spirits—though the realms of the unseen and visible differ, and mortal understanding is limited—we now repent and offer thanks, beseeching that all be dissolved.\n\nMay the true qi be proclaimed and spread, the dragon spirits stand guard.

After attaining the **Dao**, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao** and uniting with the true.\n\n**The Water Realms**\nWe, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the **Great Emperor of Fusang**, the **Divine King of Yang Valley**, the **Water Emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Jiang**, the **Divine Officials of the Twelve River Sources’ Water Realms**, and their **Immortal Hosts**.\n\n**Three Bows**—each performed with reverent repentance.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge that the **Three Powers** are thus established, and the **Xun** winds flow into the boundless sea; that the **Seven Virtues** are manifest, and the **Kan** palace is vast. They embrace the myriad streams, cradling the **Nine Heavens**. They govern living beings and oversee karmic consequences. The Emperor, concentrating his spirit upon the **Three Realms** and directing his thoughts to the **Nine Purities**, invokes the **Great Dao’s** grace and divine response through numinous merit. Seeking to magnify the blessings of purity, he repays the **True Spirits**. With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the **Great Emperor of Fusang**, the **Divine King of Yang Valley**, the **Water Emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Jiang**, the **Divine Officials of the Twelve River Sources’ Water Realms**, and their **Immortal Hosts**.\n\nMay extraordinary auspices be widely bestowed, and vast currents bring radiant protection.

May the Eastern Palace and princely residences, the inner screens and outer defenses, all propagate the **Wind of Dao and Virtue**, eternally enjoying the transformation of **Ascendant Peace**. After attaining the **Dao**, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao** and uniting with the true.\n\n**The Sacred Scriptures**\nWe, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the **Thirty-Six Divisions of the Supreme Scriptures**, the **True Writs and Sacred Talismans**.\n\n**Three Bows**—each performed with reverent repentance.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge that before the **Kalpas of Eons**, the **Supreme Perfected** propagated transformation. They revealed the **Root of Non-Speech** through tranquility, and accomplished the **Non-Governing** through subtlety. When the **Two Images** first took form, diverse paths emerged. The **Eight Assemblies’** texts were established, and the **Six Forms’** functions vied in application.\n\nThe **Jade Slips and Jade Cases**, treasured in secrecy above the **Nine Pures**; the **Tortoise Script and Dragon Seal**, proclaimed and circulated throughout the ten thousand realms. They govern humanity and heaven, overseeing the bright and the hidden, the manifest and the obscure.\n\nNow, the Emperor, by heaven-endowed sagacity, grasps the celestial reckoning and unfurls the primordial. Bearing the grace bestowed by the **Great Dao**, moved by the luminous manifestation of divine merit, he aspires to exalt the **Fast of Blessings**, repaying the profound favor from on high.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the **Supreme Perfected, Thirty-Six Divisions of the Most Revered Scriptures**, the **True Writs and Sacred Talismans**.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Emperor’s longevity equal the **Mountains of Heng and Hua**, his brilliance match the **Sun and Moon’s** radiance. May his divine merit surpass the **Divine Works of Lianlu**, his sagely virtue crown that of **Yao and Tang**. May the Empress, consorts, and princesses, the Crown Prince and the various princes, jointly assist in the flourishing era, extending the grand and precious mandate. May the dukes, ministers, and officials, the people of the Hua and Yi, together ascend the court of **Humaneness and Longevity**, and share in the transformation of **Ascendant Peace**.\n\nMay the **Three Paths and Nine Nights**, all beings—whether moving or still, flying or submerged—all rest in the mysterious merit, and together ascend into the **Realm of the Dao**. After attaining the **Dao**, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao** and uniting with the true.\n\n**The Forty-Sixth Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast Rites** concludes.\n**The Forty-Seventh Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast Rites** begins.\n\n**Compiled by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting**\n**Fivefold Confession of Ministers Serving the State**\n\n**The Ten Directions**\nWe, your ministers, wholeheartedly take refuge in the **Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy** of the Ten Directions, the **Perfected Great Sages** who have attained the Dao, the **Most Real Lords and Elders**, and the **Divine Officials of the Ten Realms**. With three bows, we each sincerely confess and repent.\n\nWe have heard that the **Ten Poles of the Heavens** and the **Three Thousand Dao Realms** encircle the Great Void within, encompassing the courts of the **Three Realms**. They manifest wondrous transformation in the **Upper Mystery** and bestow numinous grace upon the **Lower Lands**. How vast is this radiant fortune, faithfully protecting the state and its households!\n\nToday, we humbly offer the **Great Yellow Register Fast** on behalf of [such-and-such] official, dedicating it to the Emperor. Following the **Mysterious Pattern**, we array the imperial altar, beseeching blessings and grace, performing the fast and practicing the Dao. With reverence, we present incense, flowers, dragon-brocade offerings, and pledges of sincerity, taking refuge in the **Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy** of the Ten Directions, the **Perfected Great Sages** who have attained the Dao, the **Most Real Lords and Elders**, and the **Divine Officials of the Ten Realms**.

May the Crown Prince and the various princes filially support the imperial throne.

May the seasons regulate the **Five Candles**, and the years yield **Jade-like Stores**. May the **Hundred Offices** follow their proper order, and the **Five Armies** remain ever at rest.

With three bows, we each sincerely confess and give thanks.\n\nWe have heard that when Heaven and Earth divided their numina, Yin and Yang formed their images. The positions of the **Sun, Moon, and Stars** were established, determining the distinctions of dusk and dawn, concealment and visibility. The **Seven Governors and Three Palaces** faithfully hold the essentials of life and death; the **Wenchang and Dipper Poles** still wield the authority over sin and fortune. It is fitting to exhaust our reverence in cultivation to aid the state and nation.\n\nToday, we humbly offer the **Great Yellow Register Fast** on behalf of [such-and-such] official, dedicating it to the Emperor, presenting ritual pledges. We array the altar, beseeching blessings and grace, performing the fast and practicing the Dao, taking refuge in the **Most Real Great Sages** of the **Palaces of the Sun, Moon, and Stars**, and the **Divine Officials of the Three Luminaries**.

With three bows, we each sincerely confess and repent.\n\nWe have heard that when **Hundun** was split open, the **Myriad Peaks** took shape. They support the **Azure Vault** in their ascent and press down upon the **Yellow Chariot** in their descent. The greatest, like **Changli**, stretch across vast wilds, housing the mists and clouds beyond the seas; the next, like **Heng and Hua**, tower as cloud-pavilions, gathering the finest essences of the world. They are the abodes of **Immortals** and the reliance of states and nations. We now present the rites of **Incense and Prayer** to broaden the blessings of **Radiant Fortune**.\n\nToday, we humbly offer the **Great Yellow Register Fast** on behalf of [such-and-such] official, dedicating it to the Emperor, presenting ritual pledges and arraying the altar.

May they transcend the fruits of the **Seven Stages of Cultivation** and verify the **Flying Ascent of the Three Heavens**. May they refine their spirits in the **Courts of Flowing Fire** and ride the **Palaces of Radiant Clouds**.\n\nMay boundless fortune forever flourish, reverently aiding the **Dragon Chart**.

With triple reverence, we each offer sincere repentance and gratitude.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge that, embodying the **Dao** and drawing upon the numinous, the **power of Water** is indeed paramount. Receiving the **Primordial Yang** to nurture and transform, it pervades all forms; originating from the **First Qi** to generate and complete, it encompasses all beings. Thus, the **Nine Seas and Eight Oceans** display the majesty of floating heaven and nourishing the sun; even a single leaf or slender stem bears the grace of moistening blessings and bestowed glory. Through its **mysterious merit and wondrous efficacy**, it brings fortune to the state and the household.\n\nToday, we reverently conduct the **Grand Yellow Register Fast** on behalf of [Title] the Emperor, adhering to the **mystic rites** and establishing the **imperial altar**. We beseech blessings and grace, performing the fast and practicing the **Dao**. We prostrate and submit to the **Great Emperor of Fusang**, the **Divine King of Yang Valley**, the **Water Emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Jiang**, and the **Twelve River Sources**, along with the **Divine Immortals and Spirit Officials of the Water Realms**. For this fast, we now kindle incense and light lamps, illuminating all heavens.\n\nMay these **merits and virtues** flow to the **august spirits of the altars and temples**, the **ancestral sages of the imperial lineage**, who wander the boundless and unite with the **subtle and formless**.

With triple reverence, we each offer sincere repentance and gratitude.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge that the **Dao in Non-Action** is the root, and the **true lineage** is emptiness and quiescence. Its **wondrous nourishment** is wordless, its **subtle and imperceptible** nature beyond measure. Thus, it initiates the **vast and expansive teaching**, revealing the **secret and profound merit**. Here, the **Eight Assemblies of Numinous Writ** and the **Nine-Ray Cloud Script** take form: dragons coil and phoenixes dance, first congealing within the **Great Vastness**; jade tablets and jasper scrolls are then inscribed within the **layered terraces**. The **thirty-six divisions** are vast, and the **myriad thousands of categories** are numerous. Their principles flow through the **profound and mysterious**, and their meanings encompass all wonders. They are revered by humans and heavens, and followed by states and nations.

May the Empress, consorts, and attendants **enjoy blessings in the Purple Court**; may the Crown Prince and the various princes **inherit the auspicious imperial standard**. May the loyal and meritorious officials **constantly exert themselves in assisting and advising**; may the **myriad living beings** **secure the flourishing and peaceful era**. May the **Heavenly Principle follow its course**, and the **auspicious stars and radiant sun** be witnessed; may the **Earthly Records be peaceful and stable**, and the **Nine Grains and Eight Silkworms** manifest their wonders. May the **hidden and manifest** together prosper, and all **movement and stillness** be at peace. May those within the **seas and the realm** together attain the **transformation of the Dao**.\n\nAfter attaining the **Dao**, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao** and uniting with the true.\n\n**The Forty-Seventh Scroll of the Grand Yellow Register Fast Rites concludes.**\n**The Forty-Eighth Scroll of the Grand Yellow Register Fast Rites.**\n\n**Compiled by Master Du Guangting of the Tang Dynasty: Methods for Expiation and Repentance**\n**General Repentance**\n\nWe now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so, who follows the rites of expiation and examination, conducts the fast, and practices the Dao, repenting for the boundless transgressions committed by thirty-six generations of ancestors, from the myriad past forebears to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. These offenses, accumulated through the ages, have:\n\n**Offended above** the great sages of the myriad heavens, the host of honored ones of the Great Dao, the Three Luminaries and Five Phases, the deities governing the void, wind, clouds, thunder, and rain.\n**Offended below** the Five Marchmounts and all mountains, the thirty-six earthly realms, the mounds and water palaces, and the underworld officials.\n**Offended within** the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces, the yin-yang bureaus, the ancient and modern numinous sages, and the worthies of former ages.\n\nThey have violated the Five Constants and transgressed against the Four Great Elements. Their names are inscribed in the ledgers of sin, and calamities are bound at the gates of darkness. Their lifespans were cut short, failing to fulfill Heaven’s allotted span. After their bodies perished, they remained detained in the earthly courts, confined as suffering souls in the deepest prisons. They have endured every torment, undergone every trial, shuttled through the Three Wretched Paths, and drifted through the Five Destinies. Subjected to cruel punishments and exhausting labors, their forms are broken and emaciated beyond endurance. Their offenses and misfortunes linger unending, with no hope of absolution.\n\nToday, in accordance with the ranks of the transcendent immortals, we repent our sins and seek mercy. We burn incense, light lamps, conduct the fast, and practice the Dao, surrendering our lives to the Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Ten Directions, the perfected great sages who have attained the Dao, the true lords and venerable ones, and the divine officials of the ten celestial realms.\n\nWe humbly implore the Three Honored Ones and the great sages of the myriad heavens to open the fount of great compassion and bestow boundless grace. May they command the flying celestial beings to bear the Nine Dragon Talismanic Decrees, proclaiming to the courts of the Ten Directions and the officials of the underworld hells: absolve the boundless sins accumulated through the ages. Open the Nine Dark Hells and release the souls of the long night. Bathe them in the Crimson Mound’s courts, clothe them in the regalia of the Cavernous Yang’s precincts. May they be reborn in the blessed realms of the divine, and may blessings flow to their descendants. May auspicious protection ever attend them, and may the living and the dead alike find peace. May this uphold the nation’s fortune and extend to all beings. May all attain the mysterious bliss and forever ascend to the true ranks.

In the endless dark of night, there is no means of deliverance.\n\nToday, we repent, seek mercy, conduct the fast, and practice the Dao. We humbly implore the great compassion to show mercy, and the myriad sages to turn their radiance toward us.

These sins may include: failing to yield with righteousness, flattery and deceit without cause; envying the worthy and able, defiling and disrupting the divine Dao; cruelty without measure, slaughter driven by whim; breaking vows and violating covenants, scheming with curses and hexes. The misfortunes and transgressions congeal like mountains, the punishments severe and the trials profound, yet no absolution has been granted. The souls are bound and detained in the Metal Bureau’s Hua Mountain hells, enduring the torments of copper pillars, iron beds, and golden hammers. Day and night, they suffer unrelenting agony, with no respite in eating or resting. Their grievances entangle the living, lingering unresolved. In the endless dark of night, there is no means of deliverance.\n\nToday, we practice the Dao and conduct the fast, beseeching mercy and repenting for liberation.

In the endless dark of night, there is no means of deliverance.\n\nToday, we practice the Dao and conduct the fast, beseeching mercy and repenting for our transgressions. We humbly hope the hosts of heaven will look upon us with favor, and the myriad sages will bestow their grace.

We recite scriptures and practice the Dao, reverently submitting to the Southwest’s Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Celestial Lords of Pristine Qi, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Southwest Realm. We repent for the boundless sins committed by so-and-so’s ancestors across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. In their lifetimes, they may have spoken ornately without substance, feigned truth with deceit, deceived the wise and foolish alike, or insulted true sages. They may have sided with the strong to oppress the weak, or indulged in greed and malice without restraint. They may have contended for profit and wealth, seized reputations and ranks, or schemed to harm and poison the loyal and good. They may have endangered others to secure their own safety, killed living beings for personal gain, or plundered wealth without pity for the orphaned and destitute. They may have sworn oaths and formed pacts, invoking gods and ghosts, thereby incurring karmic retribution that now lingers in the hidden realms. Their souls are bound in the earthly prisons and courts of torment, confined in dark cells, deprived of light. They endure ceaseless trials, suffering without end. Today, we conduct the fast and practice the Dao, repenting and seeking mercy. We humbly hope the Most High Sages and August Perfected Ones, in their great compassion and forgiveness, will cast their divine light downward to illuminate the darkness. May they command the Southwest Quarter’s pounding hells and the courts of the torment officials: deliver the imprisoned souls, that they may be reborn in the courts of blessing. May all receive grace, the living and the dead alike finding peace. Should our prayers be answered, we shall forever bear the profound grace.\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, they ascend into the formless,\nharmony merging with the true Dao.\n\nTo the Northwest Quarter:\nWe now burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so’s performance of the Supreme Fast for Deliverance from Torment. We recite scriptures and practice the Dao, reverently submitting to the Northwest’s Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Celestial Lords of Pristine Qi, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Northwest Realm. We repent for the boundless sins committed by so-and-so’s ancestors across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. Their transgressions run deep, their torments severe, their offenses spanning kalpas without resolution. They suffer retribution across the six destinies and three evil paths, their souls beaten and bound in the earthly prisons and pounding hells. The pain is unbearable, extending to their descendants, the misfortunes flowing endlessly across kalpas. Today, we repent and seek mercy, conducting the fast and practicing the Dao. We humbly beseech the assembled August Sages and Most High Worthies to bestow their compassionate light, absolving the imprisoned souls and delivering them from hidden suffering. May they command the Northwest Quarter’s pounding hells and the courts of the torment officials: resolve grievances, settle disputes, and eradicate all accumulated transgressions. May the living and the dead alike be delivered, their households and nations receiving grace.\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, they ascend into the formless,\nharmony merging with the true Dao.\n\nTo the Upper Quarter:\nWe now burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so’s performance of the Supreme Fast for Deliverance from Torment. We recite scriptures and practice the Dao, reverently submitting to the Upper Quarter’s Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Thirty-Six Celestial Lords, the Lords of Pristine Qi of the Jade Capital, Mystic Metropolis, Purple Tenuity, Golden Gates, the Three Clarities, and the Three Realms, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Upper Realm. We repent for the boundless sins committed by so-and-so’s ancestors across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. In their lifetimes, they may have defied the heavenly Dao, defiled the Three Luminaries, exposed the divine to the elements, or raged against thunder and rain. They may have deceived both the hidden and the manifest, showing no fear of true spirits. The Nine Offices have imposed punishments, the Three Bureaus have meted out trials. Their souls are beaten and bound in the eternal night of the Nine Dark Prisons. They drift through the cold courts, confined in dark cells, lost in endless kalpas without light. Their misfortunes flow to their descendants, entangling both the living and the dead in mutual accusations, with no means of cleansing. Today, we repent and seek mercy, conducting the fast and practicing the Dao. We humbly beseech the Three Clarities, the myriad sages, the Most High Perfected Ones, the Celestial Lords, the Four Controllers, the Five Emperors, the Three Luminaries, the constellations, and the true spirits of the Three Realms to bestow their vast compassion and witness our sincere devotion. May they command the courts of the torment officials and the earthly prisons: deliver the souls, absolve their crimes, resolve grievances, and free them from suffering to be reborn in heaven. May they ascend to the halls of blessing, hear the scriptures, and awaken to the Dao. May they forever transcend life and death, entering the realm of non-action. May disputes be settled, the living and the dead alike finding peace. Should our prayers be answered, we shall forever bear the profound grace.\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, they ascend into the formless,\nharmony merging with the true Dao.\n\nTo the Lower Quarter:\nWe now burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so’s performance of the Supreme Fast for Deliverance from Torment. We recite scriptures and practice the Dao, reverently submitting to the Lower Quarter’s Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Nine Mound Earthly Sovereigns, the Four Controllers, the Five Emperors, the Twelve Immortal Lords, the Nine Palace Perfected Ones, the divine immortals, jade maidens, and the spirit officials of the Lower Realm. We repent for the boundless sins committed by so-and-so’s ancestors across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. In their lifetimes, they may have falsely claimed mastery of the Dao, carved up lands, hills, ridges, plains, and waterways. They may have destroyed tombs and temples, suppressed divine spirits, blocked water sources, or dammed mountains and valleys. They may have razed city walls, altars, and shrines, or offended the earthly officials of marquisates and principalities. They showed no fear of the divine, indulging in evil without restraint. Their souls are beaten and bound in the Lower Realm’s Nine Dark Prisons. They draw water from the eternal night’s river to irrigate the Four Waterways, or bear mountains and carry stones, condemned to endless labor.\n\nTheir suffering is bound as an infant’s, endless through all time. It extends upward to past lives, downward to descendants. Retribution remains unfulfilled, calamity deepens, and punishment grows heavier. Now, through the performance of this fast and the practice of the Dao, we repent and uproot the roots of sin. We prostrate ourselves, beseeching the august assembly of saints to open their mercy and grant pardon. We implore the underworld officials of Fengdu, the Nine Dark Prisons, and the halls of judgment to absolve the boundless karmic causes of past kalpas. May the destitute souls be delivered, freed from the depths of darkness, to roam the true realms and dwell in the land of blessings. May descendants enjoy peace and prosperity, and may the living and the dead alike find serenity. Should our plea be granted, we shall reverently bear the profound grace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\nThe Three Luminaries:\nWe now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this supreme and wondrous fast for the liberation of so-and-so, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the palaces of the sun, moon, and stars, the perfected and great sages, the divine immortals and all spirit-officials of the Three Luminaries. We repent for the boundless sins of so-and-so’s family—across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. They may have been unrighteous rulers, disloyal ministers, unkind fathers, or unfilial sons. They violated the celestial patterns and earthly principles, as well as the sun, moon, and stars, accumulating deep stains of evil. Their hidden sins and manifest transgressions were inscribed in the ledgers of wickedness. Upon death, their souls were seized by ghostly officials and confined in the eternal night’s halls of judgment. Beaten and bound in heavy fetters, they had no means of expiation. Now, through repentance and the seeking of grace, through the performance of this fast and the practice of the Dao, we prostrate ourselves, hoping the great sages of the heavens and the august assembly of the Three Luminaries will command the underworld prisons and halls of judgment to absolve their accumulated sins and reconcile their enmities. May their debts and disputes be settled, and may the living and the dead find peace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\nThe Five Peaks:\nWe now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this supreme and wondrous fast for the liberation of so-and-so, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the True Lords of the Five Peaks, the grotto-heavens of the famous mountains, and the divine immortals and all spirit-officials who have attained the Dao. We repent for the boundless sins of so-and-so’s family—across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. They may have recklessly provoked offenses, defying the divine. They violated the famous mountains and great rivers, the sacred sites and blessed lands, the lords of hills and plains, and the hidden officials and spirit-offices. Their sins coiled endlessly, never pardoned. Their souls were seized and bound in the earthly prisons of the Five Peaks. Their suffering was complete, endless through all time. Now, through the performance of this fast and the practice of the Dao, we repent and seek grace. We prostrate ourselves, hoping the myriad sages will extend their compassion and the heavens will witness and protect. We implore the officials of the Five Peaks’ prisons and halls of judgment to dissolve their enmities, wash away their sins, and eradicate all evil. May the Nine Dark Prisons be illuminated, and may our plea be granted, bearing the profound grace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\nThe Water Realms:\nWe now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this supreme and wondrous fast for the liberation of so-and-so, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the Great Emperor of Fusang, the Divine King of Yang Valley, the water emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Jiang, and the divine immortals and all spirit-officials of the Twelve River Sources and Water Realms. We repent for the boundless sins of so-and-so’s family—across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. They may have slighted the true spirits, disrespected the divine, defiled the springs, or harmed the rivers and marshes. Their transgressions became manifold, binding them in the nether courts. Their souls were seized and beaten, confined in the Water Realms’ prisons under the halls of judgment. They endured every torment, their suffering unbearable, hauling and drawing the dark waves to irrigate the Four Waterways. Through the icy rivers and freezing nights, their bodies cracked. They saw no light, with no means of deliverance. Now, through the performance of this fast and the practice of the Dao, we repent and seek grace. We prostrate ourselves, hoping the myriad sages will witness our plea and the Three August Ones will grant pardon. We implore the officials of the Water Realms’ prisons and halls of judgment to untie their enmities, absolve their sins, and erase their transgressions. May they depart the land of darkness and ascend to the realm of purity. May their souls be refined, attaining ranks to be born in heaven. May their sins be forever erased, and their descendants enjoy peace and prosperity. Should our plea be granted, we shall reverently bear the profound grace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\nThe Sacred Scriptures:\nWe now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this supreme and wondrous fast for the liberation of so-and-so, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the thirty-six divisions of the most perfected and supreme sacred scriptures, the true writs and precious talismans, the secret treasuries of the heavens, the true Dharma of the ten directions, and all spirit-officials who guard the scriptures. We repent for the boundless sins of so-and-so’s family—across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. In past kalpas and future kalpas, across a hundred million lives, through the deeds of the three karmas and the creations of the six senses, their hidden sins and manifest transgressions were heavy in judgment and deep in punishment. They may have slighted or desecrated texts, defiled sacred writs, slandered the holy scriptures, or leaked secret texts. Their calamities coiled endlessly, never repented. Their souls were seized and beaten, confined in the Nine Dark Prisons. They endured torture and were bound in dark fetters. Through the eternal night, they had no means of deliverance. Now, through repentance and the seeking of grace, through the performance of this fast and the practice of the Dao, we prostrate ourselves, hoping the spirit-officials will memorialize the throne and extend their merciful blessings. We implore the officials of the underworld prisons and halls of judgment to dissolve their karmic retributions and reconcile their enmities. May they transcend the gates of the Yellow Springs and ascend the path of blessings. May their descendants be secure and prosperous, and may the Nine Nights and Three Paths alike receive radiant protection. Should our plea be granted, we shall reverently bear the profound grace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\n*Concluding the forty-eighth scroll of the* **Ritual of the Yellow Register Fast of the Most High**.\n\n**Forty-Ninth Scroll of the Ritual of the Yellow Register Fast of the Most High**\n*Edited by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting*\n\n**Reporting Merits and Presenting Memorials**\n\nWhen the days of the fast are complete, either at midnight of the final day or at dawn the following morning, the assembled officials shall arrange themselves in ranks before the Mystic Master. Once the formation is set, they shall chant the *Dao* and enter the chamber. Each shall bow to the Master, maintaining visualization as prescribed.\n\n**Invocation of the Five Stars’ Protective Radiance**\nThe Five Stars array their illumination, resplendent across the five directions.\nThe Water Star averts calamity,\nThe Wood Power brings prosperity.\nMars dispels misfortune,\nVenus repels warfare.\n[Missing character] The Earth Star’s fourfold governance ensures the state’s flourishing.\nInscribed upon jade tablets, names recorded in the Celestial Palace,\nThey ride the whirlwind, wielding light, soaring through the Great Void.\nEmerging from and entering the unseen, they wander and feast in the ten directions.\nFive-colored clouds overspread them, summoning spirits and commanding winds.\nThey dispatch the myriad numina, upholding the Transcendent Elder above.\n\n**Striking the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**\n\nO Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, First Three *Qi*, Supreme Dao Lord, we summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Incense-Bearing Golden Youths, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Thirty-Two Fragrant Officials of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Register for this day. Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn vestments, to open the gates of the Mystic Altar’s Celestial Thearchs. Let the local earth gods and territorial true officials swiftly ascend to receive this summons.\n\nWe now reverently offer incense on behalf of the petitioner’s intent, praying that the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao *qi* and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend and flow into our bodies. May the Mystic Altar be purified, within and without, to attain perfection. May the heavens be free of defilement, the earth purged of demonic dust. May the jade chimes resound, the ten directions grow hushed and clear. May the myriad demons not intrude, and our sincerity ascend unobstructed. May our plea swiftly reach the presence of the Most High, Boundless, Perfect, and True Jade Emperor of the Supreme Dao.\n\n**Each declares their dharma rank:**\nDisciples of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Mystic Capital, conducting the Great Yellow Register Fast, reporting merits and presenting memorials, performing the rite of offering and casting the dragon tablets, and concluding the return-to-palace liturgy.\n\nWe now burn incense, dedicating these merits above for the ancestral spirits of the imperial ancestral temple, the reigning emperor, the civil and military officials, the ministers and all functionaries, as well as for the petitioner’s nine generations and seven degrees of kin, living family members, our own three masters and nine ancestors, all people under heaven, every sentient being, and those lost in the dark paths of the unseen realms. We surrender body, spirit, and destiny to the Ten Directions’ Boundless Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy.\n\nWe beseech forgiveness for the heavy sins of past lives and this existence, deliverance from the Three Evil Paths, and relief from the ten sufferings, eight adversities, and nine calamities. May our bodies attain the true Dao and traverse the empty sky. May we ascend to heaven in broad daylight, awaiting attendance upon the Dao Lord. May we roam freely in the Supreme Golden Palaces of the Seven Treasures’ spontaneous halls, forever harmonizing with the Dao.\n\nMay our mystical entreaty ascend before the Perfect and Boundless True Dao.\n\n**Homage to the Ten Directions**\n**Confession of Transgressions**\n\n**Threefold Invocation Hymn**\n\nThe Law is my beloved wife,\nthe scriptures treasured as jade bright.\nHolding fast the precepts, I restrain the six passions;\nmindful of the Dao, I cast aside all desire.\nSerene and pure, my upright qi abides;\ntranquil and still, my spirit rests in silence.\nHeavenly demons all revere and guard me,\nlife after life I receive boundless fortune.\nMy household and kingdom flourish in abundance,\nthe scriptures and Dao thrive in majestic splendor.\nHeaven and humankind share this one aspiration,\nsoaring aloft in the vastness of the Great Vehicle.\nFrom the heart I establish my field of merit,\nas the Wheel of Dharma ascends in gentle ascent.\nMy seven ancestors ascend to the heavenly halls,\nwhile my own body soars in broad daylight.\nThe Great Dao pervades the mysterious void—\nwith thought, nothing fails to align.\nRefining my form, I enter the immortal truth,\nand attain the adamantine body.\nI transcend the trials of the Three Realms,\nthe five torments of hell are released.\nAll return to the scriptures of the Most High;\nin silent contemplation, I bow in reverence.\n\n**Threefold Prostration**\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow in reverence to the Boundless Great Dao of the Most High.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow in reverence to the thirty-six revered scriptures.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.\n\n**Ritual Circumambulation**\nGathering the true writ, from the east, south, west, north, and center, each at their respective altars, incense is lit to fumigate the true writ. All officials chant the true writ in unison, and the disciple holds the true writ over the incense to fumigate it.\n\nThe Dharma Master strikes his teeth twelve times and recites the incantation:\n*\"Primordial Beginning of the Upper Heavens,\nthe Three Luminaries shine in lofty brilliance.\nTurning light to illuminate,\nthe four directions gleam in clarity.\nGuiding the flow of destiny,\nsparking yang like streaming stars.\nThe five phases clash in discord,\nthe three constellations lose their peace.\nThe Five Celestial Palaces gather the stars,\nthe Seven Luminaries radiate their numen.\nTrue Lord, Great Chief,\nwhose hidden name is Jade Essence.\nThe Lady, Heavenly Consort,\nis called Nurturer of Infants.\nTogether they govern the Mysterious Pass,\nrevolving all heavens.\nNow, with certain calamities,\nominous portents have been mystically revealed.\nI present this true writ,\ninscribed in red, to ascend above.\nDisheveling my hair, I confess my transgressions,\nbaring my crimson sincerity.\nI beseech your mysterious scrutiny,\nto restore the celestial scriptures.\nLet qi not flow amiss,\nlet disasters not arise untimely.\nBurning the sacred writ,\nits smoke scatters in the Jade Court.\nThe Upper Radiance oversees and delivers,\nproclaiming to the myriad spirits.\nQi purifies the Three Passes,\ndisasters vanish in the Nine Nether realms.\nYin and yang harmonize,\nthe land enjoys great peace.\nI entreat the Golden Dragon,\nto swiftly transmit this by wind and fire.\"*\n\nThis incantation derives from the *Red Writ of Jade Secrets*. During the Three Primes and Eight Festivals, when performing the Yellow Register rites or rituals of deliverance, inscribe the text of the Year Star’s assistance to the liver, and use this incantation. If exorcising demonic epidemics, inscribe the Eastern Mountain Divine Incantation, which has its own separate incantation. To avert the hundred-and-six great calamities, inscribe the text to subdue the Eastern River. For scholars cultivating the self, inscribe the Nine Qi of the East. If stars or constellations stray from their courses and the Nine Luminaries bring disaster, follow this incantation.\n\nThe *Jade Secrets* state: *\"In all prayers and exorcisms, if one does not first strike the teeth before reciting the incantation, external demons will intrude, and the gates of response will remain unopened.\"* It further states: *\"If the baleful star is in the east, expose the writ for nine days, and the Golden Dragon will pacify it. For seven days in the west, three in the south, five in the north, and twelve in the center—all follow the qi and numerology of the Great Dao. The baleful star in the east refers to its presence among the Horn and Neck constellations; the rest may be inferred accordingly.\"* Conclude by burning this true writ along with the memorial.\n\nAmidst the dispersing azure smoke of incense.\n\nUpon the conclusion of the incantation, all officials bow again, each following this precedent.\n\nSolemnly invoking their dharma-positions, the disciples of the Upper Clarity and Mystic Capital, your servants [Name] and others, reverently and repeatedly address the Most High, Boundless, and Great Dao—the Primordial Celestial Venerable of the Origin; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Supreme Mystic Elder; the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure Celestial Venerables; the Great Sage Assemblies who have attained the Dao; the Perfected Lords and Masters; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Center; the Celestial Master Lord; the Supreme Ministers and Prime Councilors; the Four Offices and Five Emperors; the Eastern Marchmount’s Minister of Fate and True Lord of Life; the Western Ultimate’s Sovereign of All Perfected Ones; the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lower Teaching; the Numinous Palaces of the Five Marchmounts; the Grotto-Realms of Famous Mountains; and all responsive and efficacious numina of the Three Realms.\n\nBy karmic affinity with the Dao, your servants have personally encountered the true transformation. The Celestial Venerable expounded the Dharma, and the Three Caverns proclaimed its practice. Sacred instructions and numinous charts bring salvation to households and peace to the realm. Having been granted participation in the wondrous and true, we were permitted to receive and cultivate it. Yet first, we must establish merit to universally benefit both the hidden and the manifest. It is fitting to magnify the sagely teachings and broadly deliver heaven and humanity. None who sincerely submit shall be rejected or forsaken. Now, in obedience to the edict, how dare we not report above?\n\nReading the memorial:\nFollowing the memorial’s sincerity, we have joined together in mutual support. Consulting the codes of the numinous immortals and perusing the texts of the Yellow Register, we act on behalf of [Name] at the [Name] Abbey in [State and County], establishing the ritual forms of the Mystic Rite and modeling the Two Modes. We present the lamps, candles, incense, flowers, golden dragons, and silken banners—pledges of our destined lives—to attest and verify our cinnabar sincerity. Beginning at the midnight hour of [Day], we initiate the fast. Burning incense and pacing the Dao, we repent and give thanks to the Mystic Perfected. Kindling lamps to continue the light, we illuminate the Three Realms, reaching downward through the Nine Earths and upward to all heavens. We deliver the living and rescue the dead, universally benefiting household and state. For [Number] days and nights, we pace the Dao and recite the scriptures. At the eleventh hour of [Day], the merit is perfected and the task accomplished. The lotus lamps dim their flames, and the jade chimes gather their sound. The immortal chariots return to the Upper Mysteries, and the Dharma’s flow disperses through the lower realms. Golden dragons ascend in radiance to report the fast’s merit. The sagely grace extends compassion, opening deliverance to the hidden and the lost. Rewarding merit and bestowing honors, it universally reaches the numinous offices.\n\nWithin our bodies, the inner and outer Perfected Officials we bear, the soldiers and scribes of the Three Caverns, the stellar lodges and Nine Palaces, the Five Emperors, the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the troops and cavalry, the attendant incense-bearing Golden Lads, the flower-scattering Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans who transmit and report, and the Flying Dragon Cavalry—all have labored with merit. Now, they shall be separately honored. On yellow silk and vermilion memorials, their merits are proclaimed and promotions recommended.\n\nYour servants’ mastery of the Dharma remains incomplete, constrained by the measures of reverence and humility.\n\nAdvancing or halting in violation of statutes, failing to conform to ritual propriety—we fear being impeached by the Four Offices or seized by the Five Emperors. For a thousand transgressions and ten thousand faults, we beseech pardon and forgiveness. Though our ignorance remains unenlightened, may no punishment be visited upon us.\n\nAt the commencement of this retreat, we reverently invited the Wisdom of the Highest Grade and performed the Ten Precepts Dharma rites, which now being concluded, we escort them back to the Heavenly Palace. The retreat we have conducted is now complete in merit and accomplishment. To further clarify these merits, we present a memorial on yellow silk with vermilion script.\n\nUpon our jade table, we request the inspection of the memorial text. The text is inscribed on five feet of fine yellow silk, with vermilion borders and vermilion script, each line containing twenty-four characters. No \"living\" character appears at the bottom of a line, nor any \"dead\" character at the top. The first line records the Dharma rank in full, concluding with the phrase \"bowing my head.\" The opening address occupies its own line. \"The Most High and Boundless Dao Lord\" appears on the third line. After \"the memorial is hereby presented,\" omit the supplicant’s surname for three lines. After the sacred title, again omit the surname for three lines. The date follows, separated from the sacred title by three lines. All must adhere strictly to the prescribed format, with no emendations—lest corrections incur reprimand, a matter of utmost gravity.\n\n**Reading the Memorial**\nTake the memorial from the incense burner, fumigate it, and begin reading. At the mention of the Dharma rank, bow twice, then resume the kneeling posture. Maintain a harmonious voice and upright qi. When the disciple’s name is read, bow twice again. From the phrase \"your servant, in trembling awe,\" bow twice more. At the date and place, bow once more, then bow twice again. When finished, spread the memorial upon the jade table, aligning it directly before the Celestial Presence. Secure it with a dragon-headed writing knife to the left of the sacred title and a vermilion brush to the right, then resume the kneeling posture. Light three pinches of incense, strike the teeth three times, and dispatch the memorial, issuing the decree:\n\nWe solemnly dispatch the Perfected Officials of the Five Constituents within our bodies, each accompanied by one minor clerk and twelve scribal assistants. We further command the Merit Officers, the Flying Dragon Cavalry, and the Courier Envoys to attire themselves in full regalia—crowns, sashes, pendants, inkstones, brushes, and girded swords—to prepare the records. Without delay, they shall bear this yellow-silk vermilion memorial to the Heavenly Bureaus and present it in audience. Should any errors occur—omissions, misplaced characters, disordered phrases, or improper sequencing—the transmitting scribes, attendant clerks, and their dragon-headed writing knives and long-haired brushes shall correct them on the spot. Let no supervising official have cause to return it.\n\nHolding the breath, ascend the memorial directly to the presence of the Most High and Boundless Dao Lord of the Three Heavens. Proceed without delay. The Left Lord shall pass through the gates, the Right Clerk shall announce in proper order. Each official shall proceed according to rank. May what we have requested descend, what we have summoned arrive, what we have healed be cured, what we have condemned be destroyed, what we have proclaimed be transmitted, what we have promoted advance, what we have wished be fulfilled, and what we have sought be obtained. Should any subordinate official dare obstruct or intercept this memorial, preventing its ascent, they shall be seized and delivered to the nearest prison, their crimes adjudicated according to celestial law to uphold the heavenly statutes.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves, awaiting the response of mysterious grace.\n\nThe Dharma Master, standing behind the table, closes his eyes and faces the Heavenly Gate, bowing deeply in visualization. The officials and soldiers within his body, along with the Generals of the Three Primes and the Merit Officers with their mounts, array themselves before and behind him. His body ascends in a feathered carriage, a dragon-drawn chariot, rising gently within the purple qi to the gate of the Three Heavens. First, he pays homage to the Dharma Masters of the Three Heavens, then enters the left gate of the Mysterious Capital Palace. After presenting the memorial, he bears the case directly into the Three Heavens Gate. Twelve attendants—those bearing the memorial, presenting it, and awaiting its review—stand in readiness. Upon completion, he exits the Three Heavens Gate, mounts his feathered carriage with his retinue, and returns. The passage through the heavenly palaces and celestial roads follows the same sequence as the memorial rites of the Three and Five Heavens—details of which are not repeated here.\n\nNext, the inner officials strike their teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:\nThe memorial having been presented, the Merit Officers, Courier Envoys, and Perfected Officials of the Three and Five Heavens who emerged from our body shall now return—entering through the Gate of Myriad Mysteries, those on the left returning to the left, those on the right to the right. The Directing Merit Officers and overseers shall resume their original positions, ensuring no confusion. When summoned again, they shall arrive as before.\n\nStrike the teeth twice, swallow the saliva twice. Visualize the officials of the Three and Five Heavens memorial rites returning to their places within the body. Bow twice, then roll the memorial into its case, sealing it with the true writ. Place it upon the incense table. The Cavern Tablet Officer shall bear it, the Retreat Supervisor shall escort it, with banners and regalia leading the way, the disciples following. At the Heavenly Gate, it is burned.\n\nThe Dharma Master, from his position, faces the Heavenly Gate and visualizes the Perfected Officials bearing the true-writ memorial ascending with the azure smoke and vermilion flames into the Heavenly Gate.\n\n**Burning the Memorial with Invocation**\nBeings are beset by obstacles and hardships,\nThe Great Dao shows profound compassion.\nSalvation and deliverance abide in precepts and rites,\nAll are enabled to repent their karmic entanglements.\nTransgressions are recorded in the earthly prisons,\nOffenses have reached the ears of Heaven.\nWe confess our faults and pray for true protection,\nOur sincerity reverently directed to the sages.\nDevoutly we worship the Three Treasures,\nPraying to present our memorial for longevity.\nThe burning words ascend to the upper realms,\nNames presented before the Jade Emperor.\n\nLight three pinches of incense, hold the Mountain Memorial Text, strike the teeth nine times, fumigate the text thrice, then read:\n\nWe, the humble Dharma disciple [official title, name, age], born under the governance of [Celestial Emperor], named in the register of [Marchmount], now residing in [prefecture, county, village], respectfully conduct this Yellow Register Grand Retreat of [number] days and nights at [prefecture, county, temple, abode] for the sake of the state, the household, the living and deceased kin, and [specific intention]. The Daoist rites now concluded, we cast this memorial upon the Sacred Mountain. May the divine and immortal ones, the perfected of the Five Marchmounts, most numinous and efficacious, erase our names from the ledgers of sin and inscribe them in the Nine Heavens. We beseech the Sacred Mountain to dispatch a golden dragon courier.\n\nIn the reign year [name], the [year] of the [Celestial Stem-Branch], the [month], the [day] of the [lunar phase], the Three Caverns Dharma Master [name], at the [Sacred Mountain Cavern Abode], hereby concludes this proclamation.\n\nAll officials bow twice again. The disciples are then instructed to hold the memorial tablet above the incense smoke, while the Dharma Master strikes his teeth nine times and recites the incantation:\n\n\"Mystic and luminous, the Primordial Beginning oversees the true.\nThe Five Elders of the Supreme Emperor, crimson script on vermilion writ.\nHeaven and Earth’s origin, governing the Three Luminaries.\nGathering qi to summon the assembly, hastening the ascent of immortals.\nThe exalted talisman’s decree, proclaimed throughout the ten directions.\nSun, moon, and stars; the Five Marchmounts and sacred peaks.\nAbove in the heavens, below on the earth, the great spirits of the unseen.\nOverseeing life and the Register of Destiny, the Southern Three Gates.\nReceive the jade tablet, inscribe names in the cinnabar scroll.\nErase the records of transgression, elevate them as imperial retainers.\nSo-and-so (name) entrusts himself to the supreme Dao, establishing merit through this retreat.\nRedeeming the nine generations of ancestors, all suffering souls.\nThe Daoist rites now concluded, we respectfully approach the Sacred Mountain.\nWe beseech the casting of this jade tablet, the erasure of sinful names,\nthat all may attain liberation, without enmity or kinship.\nDeparting the Three Evil Realms, souls ascend to the Nine Heavens.\nDeliverance in life and death, eternal existence through kalpas.\nToday’s supplication is heard by the myriad perfected.\nWe entreat the dragon tablet to seal the pact with the true officials.\nMay our plea be conveyed by the golden dragon courier.\"\n\nAs the officials bow twice, all repeat the invocation aloud. The phrase *\"golden dragon courier\"* and the four-character memorial tablet inscription are each recited three times.\n\nThe tablet is made of *hu* wood, twelve inches in length, two inches and four *fen* in width, and two *fen* in thickness. It is bordered in vermilion, divided into five columns: four for the memorial text and one for the date. The text is written meticulously in red, without corrections or emendations.\n\nEach tablet is borne by a dragon, three inches and six *fen* in length. For the Son of Heaven, the dragon is of gold; for dukes and marquises, of secondary gold; for scholars and commoners, silver gilded with gold suffices.\n\nUpon completion of the incantation, the mountain and water tablets are sealed with blue paper, bound with silk, and stamped with the seal of the Nine Elders’ Immortal Capital. The earth tablet is sealed with yellow paper and green thread.\n\nAccording to ancient ritual, a jade *bi* head is placed within the Dragon-Casting Ceremony, marking the sealed tablet. The Dharma Master respectfully presents it to the designated cavern abode:\n- For mountains: *[Name] Mountain Cavern Abode*\n- For waters: *[Name] Spring Water Palace*\n- For earth: *[Name] Sacred Altar Earth Palace*\n\nThe Three Caverns Dharma Master [Name] seals the proclamation.\n\n---\n\n**Reading of the Water Tablet Proclamation:**\n\"Now, with reverence, [prefecture, county, village], official so-and-so (name), aged [number], humbly conducts this Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat of [number] days and nights at [location] for the sake of the state, the household, and all living and deceased kin.

Mark red borders and write in red ink, twenty-four characters per line. On the first line, the name and title are written in secret script, ensuring the final *dunshou* character concludes the line precisely. The two characters for \"supplication\" occupy the second line alone. \"The Supreme Peerless Great Dao\" begins the third line. From this point, maintain twenty-four characters per line, ensuring the character for \"life\" does not appear at the bottom, nor the characters for \"death,\" \"ghost,\" or personal names at the top. Follow the prescribed format strictly.\n\nThe undersigned, officiating the Yellow Register Grand Fast ritual, [Title] Master of [Sacred Peak] [Name] Emperor Perfected, your subject [Name], prostrates and bows deeply, respectfully addressing:\n\n**Supplication to the Supreme Peerless Great Dao, the Most True and Spontaneous, beneath the Golden Gates of the Celestial Palace.**\n\nYour subjects, in our ignorance, have presumptuously partaken in the Great Dharma. Our merits are but dust and dew, while our transgressions tower like mountains. Overwhelmed with shame and trepidation, our forms and souls lack truth.\n\nYour subjects bow deeply, bow deeply again. We, indeed humble and insignificant, fortunately rely upon the blessings of the Dao. Gratefully encountering its wondrous transformation, we are filled with boundless joy. Though entrusted with the mysteries of the celestial office and charged with the duty of salvation, our nature remains dull and blind. Yet we pledge our utmost sincerity. We pursue the compassionate breeze and embrace its teachings.\n\nThe wondrous teachings—seeing righteousness, we think of courage, day and night dwelling in our hearts. In the karmic conditions we encounter, how dare we fail to make this report?\n\nNow there is a disciple of the Great Dao from [such-and-such] prefecture, county, village, [holding such-and-such] office, named [so-and-so], aged [such-and-such] years, born on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month. We bow our heads, prostrate ourselves, and set forth our words in full.\n\nWe have heard that the Supreme Orthodox Dharma of the Yellow Register Great Retreat dissolves the sins of past and present lives—those of body, speech, and mind. Above, it benefits the imperial throne; below, it extends to all beings. It safeguards the nation and pacifies the people, averts calamities and repels harm. It augments blessings and prolongs life, dispels misfortune and dissolves disasters. It delivers the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages of forebears, all the departed spirits. It rescues the living and the dead, bestowing universal grace.\n\nRespectfully, we present offerings to the ten directions: golden dragons as tokens of faith, life-thread silks, incense, flowers, oil, and candles—all the requisites of devotion. With sincere hearts, we submit our words for your hearing.\n\nThrough our practice of the Dao, we confess and repent, acknowledging the transgressions of past lives. We sever misfortune and deliver the living and the dead. Though our words may falter, the principle remains clear and worthy of presentation.\n\nRespectfully, we lead fellow Daoist priests [so-and-so] and others, numbering [such-and-such], in accordance with the Yellow Register liturgy of the Lower Prime, the sacred statutes of the immortals. At the altar of the mysterious sanctuary in [such-and-such] prefecture, [such-and-such] county, [such-and-such] abbey, we establish the rites of the mysterious canon, modeling heaven and earth. With the golden dragons and silken banners presented, we consecrate the ten directions. We beseech heaven and implore earth, rescuing the living and the dead. Together, we exert ourselves, purifying our hearts and calming our thoughts. Covered in ashes, we prostrate ourselves, surrendering to the Most True, to pray for our wishes.\n\nFor [such-and-such] days, [such-and-such] nights, [such-and-such] hours of repentance rites, and [such-and-such] hours of scripture recitation, beginning at dawn on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month, we establish the retreat and perform the Dao. This continues until the hour of *hai* on the [such-and-such] day, totaling [such-and-such] hours. Upon the completion of our prayers and the fulfillment of our rites, we respectfully conclude the liturgy and dissolve the altar, casting the dragons into the mountains and waters. With cinnabar writings and talismanic petitions, we submit our words to the sacred altar. Prostrate upon the earth, we present a vermilion memorial on yellow silk, to be heard in the Nine Heavens. We reverently await...\n\nThe Most High, Boundless Dao, Original Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Most High Venerable One; the Supreme Mysterious Elder; the Celestial Worthies of the Numinous Treasure, spontaneously arisen in the Ten Directions; the assemblies of Great Sages who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones; the Supreme Thearchs and Heavenly Thearchs; the Heavenly Master Lords; the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center—may the radiant grace of these whom we reverently address incline toward our crimson sincerity.\n\nShould our petition be granted and the imperial decree bestowed, may it be proclaimed to the Five Elder Thearchs of the Ten Directions, the True Immortals of the Five Marchmounts, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, and the True Spirits of the Ten Realms. May they deliver and ferry across the nine generations and seven ancestors of such-and-such a household, whether bound by affinity or not, whether foe or kin, all equally—every shade and soul in darkness. May they all be enabled to emerge from the eternal night, ascending from the Nine Dark Realms into the Southern Palace. May withered bones be crowned and girded, may decayed remains bloom anew, may the wheel of transmigration be exhausted, and may they be transformed and reborn at the Gate of Blessing. May the local earth spirits guard and protect their forms, and when the spirits return to their former state, may they unite with the light and the unseen.\n\nMay all transgressions of such-and-such a disciple’s household, from past lives to this present existence, be eradicated and dissolved, all grievances reconciled. May calamities be averted, disasters dispelled, life prolonged, and destiny preserved. May the living and the dead flourish, and kinfolk dwell in peace.\n\nAbove, may the Seven Luminaries shine in full splendor, and the Two Modes endure forever. May yin and yang harmonize, and the nine grains yield abundant harvests. May the nation prosper and the people rejoice, and may all under heaven know great peace. May the Six Directions be purified, and the imperial reign prolonged. May pestilence vanish, and auspicious omens appear daily. May primal felicity be preserved, and the grace of the Dao be eternally cherished.\n\nWith reverence, we dispatch the celestial hosts summoned for this ritual fast: the celestial immortals’ legions, the perfected ones’ legions, the divine beings’ legions, the earthly immortals’ legions, the sun and moon’s legions, the stellar constellations’ legions, the Nine Palaces and Five Emperors’ legions, the Three Rivers and Four Seas’ legions, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways’ legions—each numbering nine hundred million myriad cavalry. The overseers of the fast’s affairs, the golden youths attending incense, the jade maidens scattering blossoms, the direct envoys of the Five Emperors, the messengers bearing petitions, the flying dragon couriers.\n\nWithin our bodies, the inner and outer true immortals we bear, the officials of the Numinous Treasure, the guardian generals of the palace—along with the local earth gods and territorial deities, the divinities of the Three Realms, all those who supervise, protect, and transmit commands, or who have labored diligently in honoring and safeguarding the fast—are now fully arrayed. Following our petition, they ascend to the Mysterious Capital to receive their due rewards and commendations. We beseech that the true officials be promoted in rank, the highest immortals elevated to imperial titles. According to their grades, let them be appointed to offices, their ranks and stations duly ordered, all exalted and advanced in accordance with the rites of the Great Perfected.\n\nWe, whose mastery of the Dao remains incomplete, have acted with humility yet transgressed the proper forms; our conduct has violated the statutes, our actions fallen short of ritual decorum. We fear the censure of the Four Offices and the judgment of the Five Emperors. For our thousand faults and myriad sins, we implore pardon and forgiveness. May our ignorance be met with compassion, our offenses spared from punishment.\n\nWithin our bodies, the true officials of the five viscera, having fulfilled their duties, return each to their respective bureaus. May we, through our study, attain the Dao; through our seeking, become immortals, ever to be numbered among the Perfected. May we shine with the radiance of the Three Luminaries and endure with the Five Qi.\n\nWe entreat the Most High and the assembled venerables to bestow their mercy and favor. Through the flying immortals and direct envoys of the true officials, the Merit Registrars of the Orthodox Unity, the left and right official messengers, the yin-yang divine decree officers, the chariot officers of the red talismans, the couriers of the fierce winds, the flying dragon couriers, the celestial immortal couriers, and the flying immortal couriers—each twenty-four in number—we now act.\n\nWith utmost reverence, we, on behalf of so-and-so, have conducted the Great Yellow Register Fast. The rites now concluded, we dissolve the altar, restore the ranks of heaven, and reaffirm the merit and virtue. We present a petition inscribed on yellow silk in vermilion, to be conveyed to the Most High Court of the Supreme Oneness. We, so-and-so, prostrate ourselves in awe and dread, bowing twice in submission, to make this known.\n\n[Your name], of [your state, county, and abbey], respectfully submits this on the [day] of the [month] in the [year] of the reign [title], when the Celestial Gate opens at [hour], at the altar within [abbey].\n\nAll who transcribe this petition must refrain from deletions, emendations, errant characters, interpolations, or defacement. Precision and care are required, for even earthly memorials demand meticulous calligraphy—how much more so those presented to the celestial court?\n\nThe vow is sealed, the incense reignited.\n\nFragrant Bureau Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attending Fragrant Spirits—may the places where we perform the Dao naturally yield golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred numinous perfected ones gather here, before the incense and flame. May the disciples who observe this fast, whether living or deceased, receive blessings; may their families and nations be graced with favor. May the ten directions’ immortal lads and jade maidens attend the fragrant smoke and swiftly convey all that we have petitioned to the Most True, Boundless, and Great Dao—the Three Clarities’ August Saints and the Jade Emperor’s celestial court.\n\n*Exit the chamber*\n\n**The Forty-Ninth Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast Rites Concludes**\n**The Fiftieth Scroll of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast Rites Begins**\n*Revised by Master Du Guangting of Tang Guangcheng*\n\n*Dispersing the altar and setting up the Offering Rite*\n*Enter the chamber*\n\nEach bows to the masters, visualizing as prescribed.\n\n**Guardian Spirits Invoked**\nMengzhang raises the banner; Lingguang wields the halberd.\nThey oversee the troops to bind demons,\nGrasp the light to dispel specters.\nHuangzhong governs all; Gouchen and Tengshe stand guard.\nThey stabilize the five directions, sweep away filth, and expel evil.\nGolden lads bear incense;\nJade maidens scatter blossoms.\nQi congeals into the sun’s radiance; spirits move the moon’s splendor.\nThe Numinous Treasure merges all; the ten thousand forms stand in array.\nThe Flowery Pearl gleams in empty whiteness;\nThe wondrous Dao towers sublime.\nAll perfected ones oversee the passage—\nThis is the realm of immortals.\n\n*Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times*\n\nO Most High Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Supreme Lord Lao—summon forth from within us the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon Couriers, the Fragrant Golden Lads, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants, and the Daily Fragrant Officers—thirty-six each. Summon now the local earth gods and domain spirits, the true officials and righteous deities, to swiftly emerge and open the passes.\n\nWe now properly set up this offering rite and burn incense on behalf of so-and-so, for the state and for the family, to observe the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast for so many days and nights. Through this offering rite and Dao-performing, may we receive the descending flow of the Supreme Ten Directions’ true and living qi into our bodies. May all we petition swiftly reach the Most True, Boundless, and Great Dao—the Three Clarities’ August Saints and the Jade Emperor’s celestial court.\n\n*Each declares their ritual rank*\n\nWe, your

invoke the Ten Directions’ Great Saints, the numinous immortals of Heaven and Earth, the Sovereign Lords of Sun and Moon, the Four Controllers and Five Thearchs, the Three Terraces and Northern Dipper, the true officials of mountains and rivers, the host of numinous treasures, the lords of the Three Offices, and all responsive true spirits within and beyond the Three Realms.\nWe prostrate ourselves, beseeching your boundless compassion to descend and shine your radiance in witness.\n\nYour servants, inheritors of past blessings, have been born into this present life. We have presumptuously received the sacred texts and followed the teachings of the Mysterious Dao. Our merits are lighter than dust and dew, while our transgressions weigh heavier than mountains. Truly, we should restrain ourselves and cultivate self-discipline. Yet the Dao permits salvation and aids the state in establishing merit. As all who turn their hearts toward it cannot be refused, we now have the Great Dao disciple, the official so-and-so, acting for family and state, presenting his faith and submitting his petition. He requests the establishment of a grand Yellow Register Retreat, lasting so many days and nights, to conclude at the hour of the boar on such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month. Through this, he seeks to deliver the souls of the dark night, submit memorials to the highest perfected, dispel calamities and dissolve misfortune, pray for blessings and give thanks for grace. May merit be accomplished and obstacles not arise—all relying upon the ritual register’s clerks and soldiers, the inner and outer officials, the host of perfected saints, and all responsive numinous spirits. By your great favor, may his sincere prayers be answered.\n\nIn the course of these invocations and submissions, should we have erred in offerings or violated ritual codes, or in any movement or stillness offended the divine and true, we now seek to repay the grace of your protection and entreat the bestowal of future blessings. Thus, as the rites conclude, we humbly prepare this offering feast, beseeching your majestic presence to deign to accept and receive it.\n\nYour servants and disciples, unable to bear the weight of our reverent hope, prostrate ourselves in awe and trepidation, bowing again in homage.\nNext, we offer incense, present the hot water.\n\nNext, we offer tea and present wine. Your servants and disciples once more invoke the host of saints and perfected ones, all the officials and attendants.\n\nWe have heard that the Three Clarities’ exalted sages, the Five Venerables, the true numina of Heaven and Earth, and the mysterious directors of fate—\ngenerate and complete the cosmos, nurture the ten thousand spirits.\nTheir embodiment harmonizes with non-action; their merit precedes the covering and bearing of all things.\nTheir divine efficacy is unfathomable; their virtue/power shines in both hidden and manifest realms.\nThey secretly protect the state and silently assist all beings.\nNo disaster remains unresolved; no peril goes unaverted.\nWhatever is petitioned, they surely witness and safeguard.\n\nDisciple So-and-so, turning his heart toward the Ten Poles, bows his head to the host of perfected ones,\nbeseeching that the merit of this retreat be recorded and the covenant of his devotions be attested.\nMay the ninefold ancestors and seven generations of this disciple ascend into the Vermilion Mound,\nwhere clothing and sustenance arise spontaneously and he roams carefree through the Azure Empyrean.\n\nMay your servants and disciples see all misfortunes and calamities dispersed, all transgressions and burdens dissolved.\nMay true qi flourish within, and numinous officials guard without.\nMay their years and life be prolonged, their blessings and protection ever renewed.\nIn all goings and comings, may divine spirits preserve them.\nMay the Northern Palace release the dead; may the Southern Dipper raise them to new life.\nMay the local earth deities constantly provide vigilant protection.\n\nAbove, we pray for the emperor’s ten-thousand-year reign, for the flourishing of the altars of soil and grain.\nMay the realm know great peace, and weapons fall silent.\nMay the long night of the Nine Dark Realms see all reborn in Heaven.\nMay every being under the sky together ascend to the realm of longevity.\n\nYour servants, still imperfect in their mastery of the Dao, fear transgressing the mysterious statutes.\nWe worry that our submissions may not reach, that our prayers may not be heard.\nWe humbly pray that the blue petitions and vermilion memorials swiftly ascend to the Nine Heavens,\nthat the true writs and numinous scriptures universally succor the hidden and manifest worlds.\nMay the mysterious wind spread far and wide, and beneficent blessings descend upon the earth below.\nMay the unseen and seen alike be graced with glory, and the living and dead alike know prosperity.\n\nThe rites of invocation and thanksgiving now complete, may the response be swift.\nWe, dust-bound and humble, dare not detain you long.\nMay the celestial perfected of the upper realms together ascend to their palaces.\nMay the numinous officials of the sacred peaks and rivers return each to their proper office.\nMay the fivefold bodily true officials revert to their celestial precincts.\nWe entreat that the grace of your ascent be manifestly bestowed.\n\nYour servants and disciples, unable to bear the weight of our earnest prayers, prostrate ourselves in awe and trepidation, bowing again in homage.\n\nWe burn incense and scatter fruit.\nWe sit in quiet repose and intone the incantation.\n\nThe Upper Perfected and Supreme Immortals have now returned to their celestial palaces. The attending officials, the local deities of this realm, the Twelve Hour Spirits, the Twenty-Four Officers, and all the upright gods of front and rear, left and right—let them all come and take their seats. May they partake of the offerings and respond to the sincerity of these rites, each returning to their respective domains. May they extol the transformative power of the Dao and assist in rectifying the upright while repelling evil. For so-and-so, may they dispel misfortune and ward off calamity. On the days of the Three Assemblies, their merits shall be duly reported. Should any transgress, the Orthodox Unity’s great law provides clear penalties.\n\nAll gods present, return each to your governance. Should there be further prayers and petitions, they shall be duly announced again.\n\nThe disciple bows twice.\n\n**Hymn for Sending Forth the Gods**\n\nVast and formless, the empty void,\nYet deeply moved by heartfelt emotion.\nReverence draws forth Heaven’s grace,\nNeglect invites demonic intrusion.\nFortune and misfortune rise with fate’s turning,\nAdversity and prosperity arise from karmic conditions.\nThe Dao does not prize pearls or jade,\nThe gods respond only to utmost sincerity.\nWith crimson and azure hues, we toil in earnest,\nPouring forth our deepest devotion.\nNaturally, the Great Sage is moved,\nAnd all receive the descent of radiant numina.\nHolding incense, we state our wishes,\nBowing in hope of auspicious blessings.\nThe Heavenly Worthy abides in quiescence,\nTurn your hearts to reverence the unseen.\n\nNext, proceed with the hymn of precepts, circling thrice to the position of the Precentor.\n\n**The Heavenly Worthy’s Great Compassion**\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion,\nPreaches the precepts to deliver all beings.\nVirtue and power extend to the unseen and seen,\nKarmic retribution moves the gods.\nThe hosts of heaven come to bow in homage,\nThe hordes of demons restrain their forms.\nThe past transcends the Eight Difficulties,\nThe present safeguards a thousand years of life.\nThe merit of the fast now draws to a close,\nTogether we send forth our devout sincerity.\nThe flowing Sanskrit chant soars like clouds,\nIncense smoke mingles with the sound of voices.\nJade phoenixes bear the cinnabar carriage,\nGolden dragons draw the emerald palanquin.\nIn life and death, all find joy,\nFamilies and nations all know peace.\n\nNext, complete the Three Bows of the precepts.\n\n**The Officials Receive Their Duties**\n\nThe High Master, Precentor, Fast Supervisor, Scripture Attendants, Incense Attendants, and Lamp Attendants—each according to their station—proceed in order before the Three Treasures, bow once, and kneel. The tablet is presented to the High Master, who rises, performs the Three Bows, and retires to stand in their respective positions. The High Master rises, bows thrice, and returns to their place.\n\n**The Vows**\n\nFirst, may Heaven and Earth shine in purity;\nSecond, may the cosmos be clear and mysterious;\nThird, may the sagely ruler enjoy myriad years;\nFourth, may transformation reach the Eight Limits;\nFifth, may Heaven bestow sweet dew;\nSixth, may Earth emit auspicious mist;\nSeventh, may the four seasons follow their course;\nEighth, may the myriad things flourish in wholeness;\nNinth, may families abound in filial piety and fraternal duty;\nTenth, may the nation flourish with talent and wisdom;\nEleventh, may the merit of this fast spread widely;\nTwelfth, may good omens daily increase.\n\n**Replenishing the Incense Burner**\n\nIncense Officials and Envoys, Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all attending spirit officials—let them now, at the place where the memorial is presented, naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and jade herbs. May the hosts of a hundred spirits and all the Perfected gather here before the incense burner. May the living and the dead receive blessings, and may families and nations be graced with favor.\n\nThe jade maidens and immortal youths of the Ten Directions, who attend the incense smoke, transmit the petitions we have just presented, directly reaching the presence of the Utmost True and Boundless Dao, the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven.\n\n**Eight Hymns on the Three Paths and Five Sufferings**\n*(Circumambulate thrice, as in the Step-in-Void method)*\n\nThe Three Powers and the myriad things,\nEach relies on the other, each has its spirit.\nFrom beginning to end through the great kalpas,\nWhen fortune is exhausted, Heaven and Earth collapse.\nPassing through the Five Paths,\nHow bitter to die and be reborn again!\nRevolving in the Three Realms,\nComing and going with calamity.\nGreat sages heed this warning,\nEnduring the world, severing attachments.\nFools do not believe the Dharma,\nTheir sins and pains ever cling to them.\nI grieve that the world knows no end,\nAnd so I proclaim this anew:\nIf you wish to escape this suffering,\nTake refuge in the Most High’s scriptures.\nSin and fortune do not come from others,\nThey truly arise from yourself.\nGreat sages thus seal their lips,\nSeeking to extinguish the roots of evil.\nExtinguishing thoughts, forgetting all,\nThey await the great dissolution.\nExpounding the Dao to pacify the world,\nThey will ultimately behold the True.\nLust and jealousy are the chief of misfortunes,\nThe greatest perils to body and life.\nCovetousness and indulgence bring such calamity,\nSurely leading to early death.\nKnowing evil yet not reforming,\nHow can this be the Dao’s peace?\nHarboring malice while feigning uprightness,\nMakes me sigh deeply.\nThe certainty of past lives is evident,\nYet the weak and dying call it false.\nAll wish to see it before their eyes,\nBut when it passes, they dismiss it as fleeting.\nGreat sages, enlightened by the Dao’s teachings,\nGrieve for the stubborn fools.\nTenderly mindful of their suffering,\nEarnestly, they cause me concern.\nHuman life is already spent,\nLike a flame in a lamp’s oil.\nThe Four Great Elements temporarily dwell together,\nThe Five Aggregates are but provisional.\nIn the prime of life, one should study diligently,\nSeeking to preserve one’s self.\nWhen fortune is exhausted, the body and spirit scatter,\nPlunging into the dark hells below.\nThe Upper Sages fear this,\nAnd so they seek the Dao to escape this suffering.\nLearning immortality is urgent,\nUpholding precepts to restrain the heart.\nWhen the void and the upright qi reside,\nImmortals and sages naturally come.\nIf you do not believe the Dharma’s words,\nWhy dwell in the mountains and forests?\nGreat sages delight in the scriptures and precepts,\nReceiving them as treasures for the body.\nTo study is always bitterly late,\nTo cultivate the body, one regrets not starting sooner.\nBy the time one grasps the profound,\nIn a flash, the years have grown old.\nHolding the scroll, chanting to the utmost,\nOne faces death with pain and sorrow.\nThus, in my youth, I abandoned the world\nTo study the Dao.\n\n**Hymn for Dismissing the Altar**\n\nThe vast emptiness embraces all forms,\nThe Utmost Dao is profoundly formless.\nHarmony conveys the wondrous qi,\nResponse and feeling reach the heart’s sincerity.\nIn an instant, it pervades the Eight Extremes,\nRelying on its radiance, it descends with the myriad spirits.\nSubtle incense presents our pure devotion,\nOffering our substance to express our cinnabar sincerity.\nFrom afar, we soar beneath the phoenix canopy,\nFrom afar, we grasp the brocade banner of the phoenix.\nThe smoke officials stand tall and lush,\nThe cloud pavilions rise high and majestic.\nThe jade carriage emerges from the heavens,\nThe golden dragon enters the Great Purity.\nSweet dew bathes the human world,\nFamilies and nations all know peace.\n\n**Exiting the Altar**\n\nThe *Huaxia Hymn* is chanted, leading to the Three Masters’ positions, where all take their places and offer incense.\n\n**Hymn for Taking Leave of the Three Masters**\n*(If the Three Masters’ positions are not set, then send them off at the Heavenly Gate.)*\n\nThe fast now complete, we look up in gratitude for the mysterious grace.\nBowing in homage, we take leave of the Scripture Master.\nThe scriptures and Dharma follow the profound and wondrous,\nTheir reverence all depends on the Master.\nAll who wish to establish goodness,\nMust pay homage and make vows.\nWith focused qi, merit is easily achieved,\nWith a careless heart, regrets are hard to undo.\n\nThe incense is replenished in the burner.\n\nIf one can diligently maintain mindfulness,\nMorning and evening, one soars as an immortal.\nThe fast now complete, we look up in gratitude for the mysterious grace.\nBowing in homage, we take leave of the Register Master.\n\nThe Dao holds fasting as paramount,\nThe Dharma regards audience as constant.\nThose who do not revere nor believe,\nHow can they wander to the Emperor’s realm?\nWith the right bones, one enters the immortal ranks,\nNaturally opening the purple chambers.\nThe Mysterious Woman ascends the cloud terrace,\nBeholding only halls of gold and silver.\nThus we bid farewell to the Three Masters,\nBowing in homage to the August Void.\n\nThe fast now complete, we look up in gratitude for the mysterious grace.\nBowing in homage, we take leave of the Ordination Master.\n\nThe towering Jade Capital Mountain,\nHow majestic is the Mysterious Metropolis!\nThe Perfected walk upon the void,\nBrightly dispelling the long night.\nThe Great Dao is magnified by human effort,\nWith sincerity of heart, the spirits naturally return.\nThe fast and Daoist practices now concluded,\nWe bow and take leave of the Three Masters.\n\nThe cloud chariot does not tarry,\nThe crane carriage cannot be detained.\nWhen next we hold a fast,\nWe shall once more extend our invitation.\n\n**Dedication**\nThe merits of the rites just performed\nAre first dedicated to the Emperor,\nThen to all sentient beings.\nTogether we rely on the mysterious power,\nTo accomplish the supreme Dao.\n\nNext, before the Mysterious Master,\nWe confess our faults and complete the rites.\nThe disciples offer incense in gratitude,\nBowing to the Central Dharma Master of the Mysterious.\nThe Six Offices concluded, the *Dujang* and those below\nExpress thanks to the Dharma Master,\nEach performing their obeisance,\nAs in the rites of the Opening Fast night.\nThe dispersal follows the usual protocol.\n\n*The Fifty-First Scroll of the* **Yellow Register Fast Rites of the Most High** *concludes.*\n\n*The Fifty-Second Scroll of the* **Yellow Register Fast Rites of the Most High**\n*Revised by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting*\n\n**Fangchan for Deliverance from Suffering and Salvation** *(Eastern Direction)*\n\nWe, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of Immediate Response and Salvation from Suffering of the Eastern Direction, and the divine immortals and all spirit-officials of the Eastern Realm.\nThrice we bow in reverence, each with utmost devotion, repenting and offering thanks.\n\nWe, your servants, have heard: in the primordial vastness of the singular qi, the Two Modes unfolded. The mystic winds stirred and forged, and the radiant sun first dawned to illumine all. The azure seas lie limpid and deep, the verdant forests lush and dense.\n\nNow, the chief patron of this grand Yellow Register Fast, so-and-so, moved by benevolence and compassion, has raised this intent to succor all beings. We grieve for the souls adrift and long confined, imprisoned in the dungeons of wind and thunder. For ages untold, their trials have endured, their judgments yet unresolved. With reverence, we perform this grand Yellow Register Fast, respectfully presenting green-woven silks and vibrant banners, taking refuge in the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Eastern Direction, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and all spirit-officials of the Eastern Realm.\n\nWe humbly beseech the numinous might of the Azure Emperor and the Perfected One of Salvation from Suffering: deliver them from the profound calamities of the ten thousand valleys, bestow the wondrous bliss of the Three Clarities. May they forever depart from all suffering and be reborn in the celestial realms. May the nation and its people enjoy peace, the living and the departed share in blessings and prosperity. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\n**Southern Direction**\nWe, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of Immediate Response and Salvation from Suffering of the Southern Direction, and the divine immortals and all spirit-officials of the Southern Realm.\nThrice we bow in reverence, each with utmost devotion, repenting and offering thanks.\n\nWe, your humble servants, have heard that the Three Qi manifest in bodily form, and the Five Spirits divide and transform. The cinnabar tablets inscribe the register of those born above, while the Fiery Continent abides as the land of immortality. Radiant as the sun at its zenith, the Star of Longevity shines with resplendent light.\n\nNow, the sponsor of this grand Yellow Register Retreat, so-and-so, turns his heart toward the Most Sacred, yearning for the Crimson Mound. Earnestly he gazes upon the august golden towers, moved with compassion to deliver those suffering in the fiery pit. Offering crimson-veined silks, he establishes the sacred Yellow Register altar. With jade phoenixes and golden dragons, he conducts the retreat and practices the Dao.\n\nWe take refuge in the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of Immediate Response and Salvation from Suffering of the Southern Direction, the Three Qi Heavenly Lords, and all divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Southern Realm. Humbly we beseech the Vermilion Heaven’s Red Emperor and the True Person of Salvation from Suffering: dissolve the karmic calamities of countless kalpas, deliver those sunk in the nine dark realms. May the flames of the fiery pit be extinguished, the torments of hell’s wardens cease. Together may all assemble with the Perfected, roaming freely in the wondrous realm.

The jade palaces stand in solemn reverence of the august White One, while the golden towers reveal the sacred power of the Divine Sovereign. The Unicorn Continent stretches afar, the Azure Sea lies deep and profound.\n\nNow, the sponsor of this grand Yellow Register Retreat, so-and-so, reverently entreats the sacred altar, upholding its wondrous purpose. He contemplates the multitudes burdened by the golden mallets, pities the prisoners beneath the sword trees—those who have endured the beds and pillows of kalpas, dwelling endlessly in the long night. Offering white-veined silks, he establishes the mysterious Yellow Register altar. The White Beast guards the direction, the golden dragon bears witness.\n\nWe take refuge in the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of Immediate Response and Salvation from Suffering of the Western Direction, the Seven Qi Heavenly Lords, and all divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Western Realm.

The Dao of Heaven flows into form, while the Mountain of Gen establishes its position.\n\nNow, the chief patron of this Yellow Register Grand Fast, so-and-so, merges heart with the wondrous realm, directing thoughts toward the Numinous Capital. Entering stillness, he burns incense and presents the Dragon-Taming Fast’s offerings. We take refuge in the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northeastern Direction, the Lord of the Brahma Qi, and the divine immortals and all spirit-officials of the Northeastern Realm. We beseech the immortals of the Gen Palace, the Perfected of Seeking Sorrow: have mercy on those who suffer the lightning flashes of the Sword Trees, recall the frost’s bite upon the Knife Mountains. The starving wretches of the Nine Nether Realms, the frozen souls of the Ten Torments—extend vast deliverance to the buried, spread universal benevolence to the distant.

Arrayed in the Kun Direction’s profound bearing, it reveals the mysterious workings of Qian’s virtue.

Since there exists an office to mete out karmic retribution, there must also be realms of sinking and perdition.\n\nNow, the chief patron of this Grand Yellow Register Retreat, so-and-so, directs his mind toward the highest realms, fixing his thoughts on hidden merits.

It apportions cold and heat, governs yin and yang, wields the authority over good and evil, and must mete out recompense in due measure. Are there not prison wardens who reverently uphold the golden statutes?\n\nNow, the chief patron of the Yellow Register Grand Retreat, so-and-so, prostrates himself and presents his plea, pouring forth his heart in earnest reflection.

After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\n**Lower Direction**\nWe, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Lower Direction, the August Sovereigns of the Nine Lands, the Four Directors and Five Emperors, the Twelve Immortal Lords, the Perfected of the Nine Palaces, the divine immortals and jade maidens, the Boundless Worlds, and the divine immortals and all spirit-officials of the Lower Realm.\nThrice we bow in reverence, each with utmost devotion, repenting and offering thanks.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge that the earth bears all things, vast and great in its impartial trustworthiness; the profound earth abides in steadfastness, spreading its mighty foundation to endure forever.

We earnestly beseech that the Nine Dark Realms be stilled, that the multitudes in the nether prisons be absolved of calamity. May the sagely transformation extend to the depths below, and may they bathe in the profound grace of the upper realms. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\n**Palace of the Sun**\nWe, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Perfected and Great Sage of the Solar Palace, the August Sovereign of the Solar Orb, the Radiant Perfected Lord, the Cinnabar Cloud Jade Maiden, and the divine immortals and all spirit-officials of the Solar Palace.\nThrice we bow in reverence, each with utmost devotion, repenting and offering thanks.\n\nWe humbly acknowledge that the Great Brilliance spreads its virtue, the radiant luminous warmth of its shining light; the celestial bodies advance their merit, their union manifesting auspicious splendor.

They store the essence of the Mao and Bi constellations, guarding the borders of Zhao and Dai. Truly, they govern drought and flood, presiding over both the seen and unseen realms.\n\nNow, the chief patron of this grand Yellow Register Retreat, so-and-so, reverently turns toward the true winds of the Dao, relying upon its transformative power.

They cradle the lands of Gong and Luo, girded by the Yi and Chan rivers. These true and numinous powers indeed govern sin and fortune.\n\nNow, the great patron of the Yellow Register Grand Fast, so-and-so, in profound supplication seeks the wondrous realm, gazing reverently toward the true lineage. Yearning to amplify the sincerity of salvation and deliverance, he desires to invoke blessings of boundless extension.

May all beings revive in clarity, and granaries overflow with abundance. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\n**Water Palace**\nWe, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Great Thearch of Fusang of the Water Palace, the Divine King of Yang Valley, the Spirit-Lords of the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the Water Thearchs of the Nine Jiang, the Twelve River Sources, and all spirit-officials and immortals of the water palaces.\nThrice we bow in reverence, each with utmost devotion, repenting and offering thanks.\n\nWe, your humble servants, have heard that the white peaks of Kunlun gather the nine bends to pay homage as tributaries; the pure sources of Mount Fan merge the Three Rivers to pour into the sea. Floating in the heavens, they hold virtue within; bearing the earth, they accomplish merit. Boundless and vast, their moisture nourishes all things far and wide. The Three Officials govern their domains, and the hundred valleys submit to their sovereign. Those yin spirits indeed preside over sin and fortune.\n\nNow, the chief patron of this Great Register Fast, so-and-so, with a heart devoted to salvation, prostrates in reverent prayer. May the merit of this fast and abstinence universally bestow blessings upon the hidden and the manifest. We present offerings of faith and hold aloft banners and standards. We take refuge in the Great Thearch of Fusang, the Divine King of Yang Valley, the Spirit-Lords of the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the Water Thearchs of the Nine Jiang, the Twelve River Sources, and all spirit-officials and immortals of the water palaces.

After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\n**Scriptural Treasures**\nWe, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Most True and Supreme Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Treasure Repositories of the Myriad Heavens, the Orthodox Dharma of the Ten Directions, and all spirit-officials who guard and attend the scriptures.\nThrice we bow in reverence, each with utmost devotion, repenting and offering thanks.\n\nWe, your humble servants, have heard that the Primordial Honored One expounded the teachings, and the Supreme Sages transmitted the lineage. The texts inscribed on purple-gold tablets of a square foot, the yellow jade slips carved with penetrating radiance. Profound and wondrous, the mysteries of the Double Mystery; abstruse and deep, the eight assemblies. They are the good causes of fortune and virtue, the wondrous roots of refuge and reliance. The aspirations of the many mountains, the masters and disciples of the multitude of sages.\n\nNow, the chief patron of this Great Register Fast, so-and-so, with utmost sincerity takes refuge in the Most True and Supreme Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Treasure Repositories of the Myriad Heavens, the Orthodox Dharma of the Ten Directions, and all spirit-officials who guard and attend the scriptures. Humbly we beseech that the True Officials of the Three Caverns praise the mysterious blessings of the sagely destiny, and that the numinous favors of the Nine Heavens extend felicitous omens to the worthy and good. May the growth of all beings, both hidden and manifest, be illuminated. May the virtuous friends dwelling in mountain caves unlock the secret formulas to ascend as perfected; may the common folk of the degenerate age awaken to the mysterious gate and delight in recitation. The three paths and nine nights, the seven mysteries of a hundred million ancestors. Together may they bathe in sagely merit and ascend to the wondrous realm. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\n*Concluding the Fifty-First Scroll of the* Great Register Fast Rites of the Most High.\n*Beginning the Fifty-Second Scroll of the* Great Register Fast Rites of the Most High.\n*Edited by Master Du Guangting of Tang Guangcheng.*\n\n**Scripture Recitation**\nIn performing the various fasts of the Numinous Treasure of the Great Register, one circumambulates the Dao thrice daily and recites scriptures thrice, totaling six times day and night, to present petitions and prayers for the disciples’ blessings. After the circumambulation, one may rest briefly before ascending the altar separately to recite scriptures and praise the Dao, with the ritual proceedings following the *Golden Register* model.\n\nUpon ascending the altar, the master dons the cap of the Primordial Beginning, a yellow skirt with a purple robe, and a five-colored cloud-and-rosy-light mantle—this is called the ritual vestment. The assembled officials wear their usual attire. The officials stand in order before the master.\n\nThe *zhiqing* intones the Dao.\nAll in the ritual arena, each with concentrated mind, take refuge in the Three Treasures, extinguishing all thoughts.\nEntering the chamber,\nApproaching the imperial table to offer incense.\n\nUpon offering incense, recite the esoteric incantation:\nJade radiance scatters light, ninefold qi congeals as mist.\nFragrant clouds densely woven, piercing straight to the Nine Heavens.\nThe Golden Lad attendant of incense, the Jade Maiden transmitter of words—\nWhat this servant petitions, heard before the Celestial Emperor.\nWhat this servant entreats, all granted as spoken.\n\nToday’s purificatory fast proclaimed, the hosts of heaven descend to the hall.\nThe Three Realms’ Five Emperors, in ranks, ascend to the Upper Clarity.\nHolding registers and grasping ledgers, all arrive before the Emperor.\n\n**Taking the Three Refuges**\nEach with reverence,\nWith wholehearted devotion, take refuge in the Dao-Treasure of the ten directions.\nMay all beings set their minds to dedication, offering all respect.\nWith wholehearted devotion, take refuge in the Scripture-Treasure of the ten directions.\nMay all beings open their minds to awakening, receiving, upholding, and reciting.\nWith wholehearted devotion, take refuge in the Master-Treasure of the ten directions.\nMay all beings universally ascend the Dharma-bridge, without hindrance.\n\nThe assembly in the ritual arena, holding tablets and concentrating the mind, sit upright in proper form.\nThe officials, each in their place, sit upright.\nChant praises in proper form.\n\n**Eulogy of Past Lives**\nWhile awaiting the procession of scriptures and the offering of water, the attendant of incense performs the incense rite.\nPast lives truly exist, yet the foolish call them nonexistent.\nAll wish to see with their own eyes, dismissing what passes beyond sight as distant.\nThe great sages illuminate the Dao’s teachings, grieving for the benighted.\nTenderly they recall the suffering of children, earnestly they cause me sorrow.\n\n**Silent Contemplation in Proper Form**\nThe master, following proper form, closes the eyes and engages in visualization, naturally proceeding with the scriptures.\n\nWhen reciting the *Scriptures of Numinous Treasure*, the master should visualize the self seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi.\nTo the left, the Azure Dragon; to the right, the White Tiger; before, the Vermilion Bird; behind, the Dark Warrior.\nThe sun, moon, and five planets illuminate the surroundings.\nAttendant immortals of the scriptures array themselves within the altar.\nA circular radiance, like the sun’s image, appears.\nUpon completion, swallow saliva three times, knock the teeth three times, and recite the esoteric incantation:\nSilent, silent, to the ultimate source,\nVastly towering, kalpas high, Ah!\nProfound and open, the scripture of cavernous mystery—\nWho can fathom this depth and distance?\nOnce entering the Great Vehicle’s path,\nWho reckons the kalpas’ multitude?\nNeither born nor extinguished,\nTo be born arises from the lotus.\nSurpassing the denizens of the Three Realms,\nWith compassionate heart, liberating from the world’s snare.\nThe Perfected One of unsurpassed virtue,\nLifetimes evermore as an immortal family.\n\nWhen reciting the *Scriptures of the Dao and Its Virtue*, the master should visualize the Most High Lord Lao, the Great Master of the Mysterious Center, Perfected Master Yin, and Perfected Master He of the Riverside.\nUpon completion, knock the teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times.\nFirst visualize the Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right, the Vermilion Bird before, the Dark Warrior behind, and the Eight Trigrams tortoise beneath the feet.\nThirty-six lions crouch before the head.\nThe Seven Stars of the Dipper in the center.\nThe five viscera generate five qi in spiral patterns, covering the body.\nThe Three Ones attend the scriptures, each with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders.\nHeaven and earth each have eighteen thousand jade maidens and jade lads guarding them.\nRecite the esoteric incantation:\nMysterious, mysterious, the ultimate source of the Dao,\nThe virtue of the highest embodies the primordial vastness.\nThough the celestial perfected are distant and wondrous,\nThey draw near through the Lord of Mud-Pellet Palace.\nPalaces and chambers all of seven treasures,\nWindows and doors naturally apportioned.\nEver pure and rightly real,\nRiding the light, ascending on purple clouds.\nSun and moon illuminate left and right,\nAscending as immortals, preserving eternal years.\nSeven ancestors born in the heavens above,\nLifetimes evermore in the gate of Dao and virtue.\n\nWhen reciting the *Scripture of Salvation*, the master faces east, knocks the teeth thirty-two times to be heard in the thirty-two heavens, and bows in the heart thirty-two times.\nClosing the eyes in silent contemplation, visualize the self seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, the interior and exterior dimly suffused.\nThe Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, lions, and white cranes array themselves to the left and right.\nSun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber’s interior.\n\nThe nape swells with a spherical radiance, its light illuminating the ten directions.\nThus clearly visualized, the secret incantation declares:\n*\"Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three-and-Five Merit Officers, the Attendants of the Left and Right, the Incense-Bearing Golden Lads, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-two of each.\"*\nUnseal and proclaim these words: today is an auspicious celebration, a hall of purity and fasting, where the scripture of boundless salvation is cultivated.\nMay this servant and those of the cyclical signs, through the recitation of the scripture, receive rebirth.\nMay these petitions ascend directly to the august presence of the Supreme Thirty-Two Heavens’ Primordial Thearch.\nInhale qi thirty-two times, then face east to recite the scripture.\nWhen reciting the *Upper Clarity* and *Cavern Spirits* scriptures, follow their respective methods: visualize, intone the incantations, and invoke the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies.\n\n**Invocation to Open the Scripture**\nBow to the Heavenly Worthy before the Void and Sovereign.\n\n**Request to Recite the Precious Scripture**\nRecite the multitude of scriptures.\n\n**Hymn to Conclude the Recitation**\nVast and mysterious, profoundly mysterious.\n\n**Hymn to Rise from the Seat**\nFor all who have come, create good karmic conditions.\nIf enlightenment is granted, reverently bear the profound grace.\n\n**The Assembly Rises**\nThe merit of reciting the scriptures, excerpted from the *Three Caverns’ Regulations*:\n\nNow, the treasured scriptures of the Three Caverns are the supreme models of the myriad heavens.\nThey weave the qi of soaring mystery into chapters of cloud-script,\ntheir meaning surpassing the unborn, their text enduring through eternal kalpas.\nThus, heaven and earth rely upon them to divide and order,\nthe sun and moon depend upon them to revolve.\nGhosts and spirits revere them for their transformative power,\nhumanity upholds them for their liberating guidance.\nThose who chant them ascend in form to the crimson clouds;\nthose who hear them are spiritually reborn in the azure firmament.\nNone—whether of heaven or humanity, the living or the dead—do not look to them in reliance.\nThey are the bridge for all beings, the gateway for the host of perfected.\n\nYet what cannot be spoken of in words is the profound treasury of the Great Vehicle.\nThere is a great Dao disciple, so-and-so, who, for state and family, delivers and uplifts the living and the dead.\nFollowing the *Numinous Treasure’s* concise texts and examining the ranks of immortals,\nhe presents patterned silks as tokens of sincerity, along with oil lamps, candles, incense, and flowers.\nHe performs the grand *Yellow Register* fast for so many days and nights,\ncirculating the Dao nine times and reciting the scriptures nine times.\nWhen he opens the scroll to expound its mysteries, his voice resounds through the Three Clarities;\nwhen he holds the text to chant its profundities, his sound is heard by five hundred million.\n\nMay the Incense-Bearing Golden Lads inscribe fragrant characters in the heavens;\nmay the Scripture-Keeping Jade Youths present the scriptural texts upon the tablets.\nThus, past transgressions dissolve, and blessings descend upon this very day.\nThe living and the dead receive the grace of flourishing peace,\nwhile all beings—moving and still—rejoice in the virtue of growth and completion.\nExtending to the teeming multitudes and the humblest of creatures,\nmay all together board the boat of the Six Perfections and reach the shore of the Three Clarities.\n\n**Three Recitations of the Scripture**\nAfter hearing the scripture, may all beings’ myriad sins be extinguished and the sprouts of goodness grow.\nAfter hearing the scripture, may all beings deeply enter the Dharma gate, take refuge, and accept it in faith.\nAfter hearing the scripture, may all beings forever sever delusion and constantly return to the true Dao.\n\n**Circumambulation**\nRecite the *Hymns to the Seven Perfected*—three or five verses—following the *Step of the Void* method.\nExcerpted from the *Scripture of the Jade Capital Mountain.*\n\nThe Dharma Master strikes his teeth, as the Sovereign resides in the Golden Flower Palace, like an infant in form.\nThe Supreme Mystery of the Void is the school; the Dao is magnified in its scriptures.\nBowing and rising, one has already attained immortality, enduring kalpas without number.\nMajestic is the virtue of the Great Perfected; serene is the cause of non-arising.\nCelestial radiance weaves empty structures, riding the void in natural ascent.\nSun and moon blaze forth, peace and harmony endure without end.\nIn learning immortality, cast aside ornate thoughts; thought upon thought accumulates in succession.\nComing and going disturb my spirit; when the spirit is restless, nothing endures.\nExtinguish thoughts and rest in empty stillness; softly enter the silence of the void.\nRequest the scriptures as if parched with thirst; hold fast to your resolve like metal and stone.\nPreserve the child and ascend the mysterious path; the Five Numinous Ones transmit the registers of passage.\nCross me through the practice of the Six Perfections, thus able to unbind the Three Nets.\nPurify the fast and worship the Primordial Simplicity; exhale and inhale to nurture the cloud-teeth.\nRoam within the Golden Gates; the Jade Capital is my home.\nNaturally, the Seven Treasures arise; each person sits upon a lotus.\nAbove, chew the fruits of the Mystic Capital; below, drink deeply of the melons of the Empty Cavern.\nThe countenance shines like ten suns; why reckon the multitude of kalpas?\nThe Dharma drum assembles the celestial immortals; the ringing bell summons the great demons.\nA numinous wind fans the fragrant blossoms; resplendent, they unfold the brocade robes.\nThe Great Perfected plucks the cloud zither; the assembled immortals strum the divine harps.\nElegant songs of the Three Heavens scatter wisdom through the Jade Flower Forest.\nThe seven ancestors ascend the Hall of Blessings, thereby treading the mysterious tones.\nIf the blessings of past lives were insufficient, this scripture would remain distant and hard to find.\nIf faith in the Dao is not wholehearted, the attempt to soar will instead sink.\nThe Dao of the Supreme is non-action; its magnification lies in the hearts of all beings.\nLearning the Dao depends on sincere faith; serve the master as if they were your closest kin.\nDraw in the radiance and match the pure void; diligently follow the daily renewal.\nUntil all people are delivered, I will not deliver myself.\nGreat vows demand profound recompense; the mysterious virtue must surely be trusted.\nHidden evils and sins run deep; when faced, they turn like a wheel.\nLearning the Dao is also arduous; day and night, cultivate the field of blessings.\nPlanting virtue is like planting a tree; heaping baskets of earth makes a mountain.\nIf you can delight in the mysterious and esteem it, you will lightly ascend the azure heavens.\nCultivate this Dao of non-action, and you will form bonds with goodness.\nThe Supreme’s most recondite scripture is called the *Chapter of Wisdom*.\nRelief from suffering comes through great talent; transcendence of the worldly comes through true virtue.\nThe numinous countenance is rare in the world, gleaming like a lotus in the depths.\nEach person’s conduct has its root, all stemming from the merit of past lives.\nEstablish virtue while there is time; make vows, and none will go unanswered.\nGood and evil both await their response; the principle of rise and fall is unfathomable.\nThe worthy uphold the Dharma’s words; the Dao also lies in forgetting both.\nTo comprehend this is great wisdom, to become a Lord of the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe jeweled canopy connects to the jade chariot; the command is given to ride the nine dragons.\nThe Golden Flower holds aloft the *Cavern Scripture*; the immortal youths all bear incense.\nWhistling and singing resound through the Mystic Capital; jade chimes strike the jasper bells.\nThe body rises to the Supreme Clarity, transcending radiance to roam the Purple Empyrean.\nUphold the Dharma’s net and wander the ultimate mystery in freedom.\nTen thousand kalpas are like last night; a thousand springs are like the morning dawn.\nTowering, it shades the cloud blossoms; hands grasp the branches of the Treasure Grove.\nFragrant smoke arises naturally; the mysterious steps ascend in a whirlwind.\nThe numinous banners disperse with the wind; manifold thoughts dissolve in their time.\nExtinguish wisdom to magnify the great unity; non-action becomes the pure chant.\n\nAll the above is the same as the *Ritual of the Golden Register*.\n\n**Hymn to the Student of Immortality**\nLearning immortality is urgent; uphold the precepts to restrain the heart’s passions.\nIn emptiness and equanimity, the correct qi resides; immortals and sages naturally seek one another.\nIf you do not believe the Dharma’s words, why dwell in the mountain forests?\n\n**Dedication Hymn**\nBefore the Mystic Master, scatter offerings as in the usual ritual.\n\nThe Left Immortal Duke of the Supreme Ultimate said: These eight true hymns are the words of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected of the Supreme.\nThe assembled immortals constantly delight in reciting them; they are not to be divulged to lesser immortals.\nSecretly hidden within the Golden Gates and Jade Chambers, they are fitting to transmit to those who cultivate the *Numinous Treasure Retreat*.\nThey must not be shown to frivolous and ostentatious people. Be cautious, be cautious.\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate Perfected said: The jade maidens and immortal youths who attend the scriptures, upon hearing these sounds of ritual, hymns, and praises, all rejoice and protect the practitioner’s body.\nThis great scripture should always be used with these hymns in worship.\nEven those who silently recite the scriptures should chant them in their hearts.\nThese are the secret words of the highest immortals, the wondrous sounds of the cultivators of truth.\n\nFrom the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Mystic Capital Jade Capital Mountain*, Chapter Three.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: The scriptures are my legacy, guiding the foolish and deluded, able to awaken the boundless Dao-mind in all beings.\nIntention arises from awakening; through awakening, one becomes true.\nAll sages in their cultivation ascend to the Dao’s fruit.\nThus, the Primordial Beginning, with one qi, generated and transformed the three qi, dividing them into the Three Heavens.\nThe first is the Primordial Qi, forming the Clear and Subtle Heaven, called the Jade Clarity Realm, where the Heavenly Treasure Lord manifests.\nAt the beginning of the Dragon Han kalpa, I was called the Formless Heavenly Worthy. In this heaven, I revealed the *Twelve Divisions of the Cavern-Truth Treasure Scriptures* to teach the nine sages of the heavens.\nAlternatively called the *Scripture of the Myriad Heavens’ Mystic Master, Supreme Dharma King*, spanning ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine billion myriad kalpas.\nThe second is the Original Qi, forming the Yu Yu Heaven, called the Supreme Clarity Realm, where the Numinous Treasure Lord manifests.\nAt the beginning of the Yan Kang kalpa, I was called the Nameless Heavenly Worthy. In this heaven, I revealed the *Twelve Divisions of the Cavern-Mystery Numinous Treasure True Scriptures* to teach the nine perfected ones of the heavens.\nAlternatively called the *Scripture of the Three Realms’ Healing King, Supreme True Worthy*, spanning eighty-eight thousand eight hundred eighty-eight billion myriad kalpas.\nThe third is the Mysterious Qi, forming the Great Red Heaven, called the Supreme Purity Realm, where the Divine Treasure Lord manifests.\nAt the beginning of the Red Bright kalpa, I was called the Brahma-Form Heavenly Worthy, also known as the Perfected One Who Observes the World. I revealed the *Twelve Divisions of the Cavern-Spirit Treasure Scriptures* to teach the nine immortals of the heavens.\nAlternatively called the *Scripture of the Ten Directions’ Guide, Supreme Heavenly Worthy*, spanning seventy-seven thousand seven hundred seventy-seven billion myriad kalpas.\nAt the Kai Huang era, I was renamed the Void Sovereign.\nIn the Palace of the Primordial Yang, I expounded the Three Caverns, descending to transform the human realm as the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao Lord, spanning sixty-six thousand six hundred sixty-six billion myriad kalpas.\nBy the time of the Supreme August, I was called the Primordial Beginning, governing from the Purple Tenuity Palace. I broadly disseminated the scriptures and precepts to save and deliver all beings.\n\nThe Three Caverns’ Treasure Scriptures comprise thirty-six divisions, also termed the Three Vehicles. The *Cavern-Real Treasure Scriptures* are called the Great Vehicle; the *Cavern-Mystery Treasure Scriptures*, the Middle Vehicle; and the *Cavern-Spirit Treasure Scriptures*, the Lesser Vehicle. They are bound by the soaring qi of the Mysterious, naturally forming their chapters—jade characters in gold script, dragon patterns in phoenix seal-script. Their great expanse spans one zhang, with eight corners radiating brilliance. They teach and transform the heavens, circulating throughout the world. From beginning to end, through kalpas unending, they perpetually turn the Wheel of the Dao. Some are true, some expedient; some broad, some concise. Adapting to the faculties of beings, they guide cultivation in accord with the age. Though heaven and earth may end their course, the Three Caverns shall never perish. They open the path for all ranks, guiding humans and celestials alike. The Three Realms and Ten Directions all receive their benefit.\n\nAt the dawn of each kalpa, the *Cavern-Real* descends to transform the world. People embrace virtue and power, dwelling together in non-action. All uphold the Orthodox and Real, attaining long life and the Dao. Next, the *Cavern-Mystery* descends, and humanity gradually drifts apart. Simplicity scatters, purity thins, and the Dao is lost while virtue is betrayed. Finally, the *Cavern-Spirit* descends, and humanity grows ever more frivolous and insubstantial. They no longer uphold the Orthodox and Real, and their years and lives grow short. From this point onward, the human heart decays. The Three Caverns cease to circulate, and worldly wisdom flourishes day by day. Humans and spirits intermingle, and the kalpa’s span hastens toward its end. Before a hundred years pass, impermanence reigns in every thought. Death follows without cease. Thus, I re-emerge to proclaim and propagate the Three Caverns, disseminating their teachings among humankind. Adapting to the capacities of each age, I expound the scriptures—sometimes great, sometimes small—suited to the needs of beings.\n\nThus, the original texts of the Primordial Beginning were not fully transmitted below. In the Three Clarities’ upper realms and the Four Brahmā Heavens, the perfected and sages cultivate the Dao, and their texts are complete. Though mountains, rivers, grotto-palaces, seas, and peaks may have their own practices, these are not fully comprehensive. For the scriptures cultivated in each region, the Three Caverns cannot be entirely complete. Therefore, I commanded Laozi to incarnate in the human realm, to save and deliver all beings, and to expound the precepts and regulations. Whether among the Yi or the Xia, whether sage or commoner, throughout the Ten Directions, all are enabled to attain liberation. The wondrous Dharma of the Three Caverns is scattered among humankind. I exhort all men and women to diligently cultivate and practice.\n\nOrdinary beings accumulate sins, their karma weighing them down in delusion. Having no affinity with the Dao, they cannot believe or uphold it. They follow only false teachings, worshipping various heterodox spirits, vainly exhausting body and mind, only to descend into hell in the end. Those who believe and practice the Three Caverns all enter the Hall of Blessings. Some ascend in broad daylight, others attain liberation through corpse-transformation, concealing their traces in grotto-palaces and roaming the world. They attain long life, change their names, and endure through kalpas without end. Refining qi and transforming form, they turn spirit to enter the Dao. None can recognize them—their number is boundless.\n\nAfter my passing, demonic teachings will flourish. The world will uniformly follow them, and people will die young. War, flood, fire, disease, and injury will bring death and harm. Nations will fall, families will perish, and these calamities will follow one after another from dawn to dusk. Treasuries will be exhausted to serve demons and heresies. Falsehood and disorder will daily increase, and the age’s frivolity will spread like a fan. Hunger, cold, and suffering will afflict all, fathers and sons will be scattered and displaced. The world will grow ever more foolish, never to awaken.\n\nI pity you, who have sunk through kalpas uncounted. Thus, I speak these essential words to enlighten the deaf and blind. Yet the wondrous Dharma of the Three Caverns comprises two kinds: the first is the True Dharma, the second the Transformative Dharma. The True Dharma transcends all falsity and endures through kalpas without end. The Transformative Dharma, conveyed through written words, changes and perishes with the times.\n\nWithin the Transformative Dharma, there are five varieties:\n1. The soaring qi of the Mysterious coalesces into cloud-seal script, forming chapters naturally. Their transformations are unfathomable, appearing and vanishing unpredictably. They abide in the upper realms of the Three Clarities, eternally guarding the scriptures. Through kalpas uncounted, they endure, protected by sages and perfected beings.\n2. The numinous script spans one zhang, its eight corners radiant. Throughout the Three Realms and Ten Directions, in the heavens’ five hundred million realms, they rise and fall with the kalpas, circulating in response to karmic conditions.\n3. In the palaces, towers, pavilions, and chambers of the heavens, between gates and doorways, they are inscribed and chanted. They subdue beings and guide their entry and exit in cultivation.\n4. Flower-patterned characters and leaf-script, jade tablets and jasper-bound volumes. On the square zhang of Penglai, in the Langfeng and Mysterious Garden, they appear and vanish unpredictably, enduring or perishing with the kalpas. They teach and train immortals, subduing demonic spirits.\n5. Written on paper, silk, bamboo, wood, and lacquer, they circulate among humankind, transmitted and chanted. At the kalpa’s dawn, they descend; at its end, they ascend. They protect nations, pacify people, and liberate all ranks.\n\nThe scriptures are the words of the Primordial Beginning, teaching and transforming all beings. They enable recognition of the root and origin, past-life karmic conditions, the retribution of sins and blessings, the auspices of good and evil. They reveal the gateways of birth and transformation, the sources of expedient means. Now, turn from evil and follow goodness, preserving and pacifying your nature and life. Attain long life and non-action, returning to the Dao. This is the eternal model. Those who preserve it receive blessings; those who cultivate it become immortals.\n\nFrom the *Sutra of Karmic Retribution and Karmic Conditions*.\n\nThe Supreme Dao Lord addressed the Three Heavens’ Dharma Master, saying: The Heavenly Worthy’s teachings and precepts, the wondrous texts of the Three Caverns—celestial script in jade characters, cloud-seal and dragon-patterned chapters—though boundless, can be summarized and categorized. Though divided into twelve divisions by type, they adapt to differing faculties. They are:\n1. Natural Original Texts\n2. Divine Talismans\n3. Treasure Instructions\n4. Numinous Diagrams\n5. Registers and Genealogies\n6. Precepts and Vinaya\n7. Ritual Propriety\n8. Methods and Techniques\n9. Arts and Calculations\n10. Biographies and Records\n11. Hymns and Eulogies\n12. Memorials and Petitions\n\nThe Natural Original Texts—celestial script in the Eight Assemblies, phoenix-seal and dragon-patterned chapters—are the root of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. They transform humans and spirits, establishing all Dharmas. They summon the Nine Heavens, the immortals, and the Celestial Thearchs. They verify and rectify registers and diagrams, adjusting the turning of the celestial sphere. They subdue Fengdu, vanquish demons, and subjugate spirits. They command the Water Thearch, summon dragons to ascend the clouds. They govern the kalpic cycles of heaven and earth, the names and titles of sages and perfected beings. They oversee the terraces and cities, the realms of the host of perfected.\n\nExpounding and distinguishing them in full, each with its descending gradations.\n\nThe arts of preserving primordial essence and transforming the form.\n\nDivine talismans are the scripts of cloud-seal, the pledges of the divine perfected. They summon and restrain the host of demons, overawing and controlling gods and ghosts. They govern the primordial and command the movements of fate, preserving life and prolonging the years.\n\nJade formulas are the true sounds by which the celestial perfected and upper sages expound and interpret the celestial script of the Eight Assemblies, revealing the Great Dao.\n\nSacred diagrams are the transformative traces of the host of sages, manifesting without fixed form. Their depicted transformations and adaptations enable comprehensive understanding.\n\nGenealogies and registers record the names and titles of the immortal perfected, tracing ancestral lineages and the positions of the divine palaces.\n\nPrecepts and regulations are the injunctions and covenants that prevent wrongdoing and examine transgressions. They weigh and measure sin and fortune, distinguishing between light and heavy.\n\nRitual decorum demonstrates the standards of fasting and purification, the models for advancing and retiring. They regulate the rhythms of bowing and rising, the norms for posture and bearing.\n\nMethods comprise the writings of the host of sages—esoteric essentials of elixirs and medicines, divine herbs and sacred fungi, the arts of refining gold, water, and jade for cultivation.\n\nNumerology and calculations clarify and discern the spirit, preserving the true and contemplating the Dao. Through fasting of the heart and sitting in forgetfulness, one roams the void and strides through the air. Ingesting the six qi and guiding the three luminaries, refining the substance and transforming the form, they are the methods of immortal transcendence.\n\nBiographies and records are the accounts of the host of sages, documenting their studies. Attaining the Dao and achieving perfection, penetrating the mysterious and entering the wondrous, they detail the places of cultivation and the times of fruition.\n\nHymns and eulogies are the artfully adorned dharma-words of the host of perfected and great sages. Extolling the true Dao, they inspire universal faith and joy, arousing dedication and fostering reverence.\n\nMemorials and petitions are the wondrous treasures and marvelous texts transmitted between master and disciple. Ascending the altar to make vows, initiating transmission and ordination, repenting and seeking blessings, they are the words of declaration and announcement.\n\nThese twelve matters comprehensively govern all dharmas. Every intention and purpose is fully encompassed within them. They transform and guide the Three Vehicles, leading into the One Vehicle Dao.\n\n**Catalogue of the Three Caverns and the True Scripture Sections**\n\n*Cavern of Perfection (Dongzhen) Precious Scriptures: Twelve Sections, totaling 230,280 scrolls*\n1.

During the Song dynasty, Master Jianji, in the course of collating and comparing, compiled the *Pearl-Bag Scripture Catalogue*, totaling 18,000 scrolls. Thereafter, amidst the wars in Jiangbiao and the military upheavals in Qinzhong, many true scriptures and secret texts were scattered and lost. Emperor Wu of the Later Zhou established the Abbey of Penetrating the Mysterious, where he collected the remaining scriptures, still numbering ten thousand scrolls. Following the conflagration of the Sui and the rise of the Tang, the imperial house flourished.\n\nDispelling malevolent influences and sweeping away demonic disturbances, the realm was brought to tranquility. By the years of the Kaiyuan era, scriptures and their oral transmissions began to flourish anew. Emperor Xuanzong compiled the *Celestial Net Scripture Catalogue*, totaling 7,300 scrolls. Additionally, there was the *Jade Latitude Supplementary Catalogue*, which recorded commentaries, treatises, and discourses, together amounting to over 9,000 scrolls. Soon after, the two Hu peoples invaded and disrupted the Central Kingdom, and the true teachings declined. The secret repositories of the two capitals were largely consumed by flames. In the first year of the Shangyuan era, the collected scriptures and registers numbered over 6,000 scrolls. By the Dali era, Master Shenfu, scouring the realm for texts and transcribing them in the capital, amassed another 7,000 scrolls. After the Changqing era and into the Xiantong period, the two streets’ transcriptions barely reached 5,300 scrolls. Recently, as great bandits violated the land and the imperial carriage fled south, the two capitals were shrouded in smoke and ash, the six directions overgrown with brambles. The true palaces and Daoist abbeys everywhere fell into ruin, and the jade-bound scriptures and jasper cases were reduced to less than a third. Amidst these dire times, I drifted to Chengdu. Though I followed the imperial retinue in selecting a new capital, my stay was brief. Again, I sought to gather texts, enduring hardships in the process. The old and new scriptures and edicts barely numbered 3,000 scrolls, yet remained uncollated. Soon after, as the court toured the provinces, the acquired scriptures were once more lost. Returning to the Three Shu regions, I wished to resume my search, but the successive military campaigns of my ancestors thwarted my earlier aspirations. Now, in the second year of the Dashun era, the eighth month, the third day of the gengchen cycle, at the Jade Bureau of Transformation in Chengdu, reviewing and examining the regulations and teachings, I set down these brief notes.\n\n*Concluding the Fifty-Second Scroll of the* Highest Clarity Yellow Register Retreat Rites\n*Beginning the Fifty-Third Scroll of the* Highest Clarity Yellow Register Retreat Rites\n\nMaster Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting, abridged:\n\nThe scriptures and regulations all state: among the officiants of the retreat, the one of highest moral stature is designated as the *Fashi* (Dharma Master). The one well-versed in the rites and regulations serves as *Dujian* (Chief Lector).\n\nThe *Dujian*’s official liturgical text further states: first sound the Dharma drum, then lead the assembly of companions. Let conduct follow proper form, and reverence rely upon the recitations. This—reciting, chanting, and guiding—constitutes the *Dujian*’s duties.\n\nIn the regions of Jiangbiao in Wu, and between Ke and Chu, the *Dujian* holds the chime-stone to direct the rites and lead the ceremonies. The phrase “first sound the Dharma drum” refers to the bells and chime-stones, intended to ensure that all officiants are solemnly aligned, their deportment stern and ordered. One must first strike the chime-stone to unify the assembly, then recite and chant as they ascend the altar—this, too, is the *Dujian*’s responsibility.\n\nYet in recent years, when the *Dujian* is of advanced age or virtue, and reluctance arises to burden them with every task, one person from among the officiants is appointed to hold the chime-stone and intone the rites. Though this arises from immediate necessity, it is not an ancient institution. Upon examination, such delegation of duty is a dereliction of office.\n\nMoreover, some later students, acting on their own whims, have arbitrarily appointed an additional person to hold the chime-stone, creating a position outside the six offices without any canonical basis. The error deepens further.\n\nThe *Gaogong Fashi* (High Merit Dharma Master) holds the duty of presenting petitions and proclamations. Their movements and bearing lead the assembly. Should age or infirmity render them unfit, they may seek retirement—how can they delegate their role and thus proliferate superfluous personnel?\n\nIn present-day Shu, the *Gaogong*’s duties are confined to invoking and sealing the incense burners, announcing their name and rank twice. All other proclamations are entrusted to others. Though they may chant first while others follow, how does this differ from a dragon’s roar met by a turtle’s echo? Such conduct invites karmic retribution and self-incurred blame. If human affairs cannot tolerate it, how can the Dao of Heaven respond in kind? Future masters of the rites must take heed: do not pursue immediate convenience, lest you compound your sins in the hereafter.\n\nThe *Jianzhai* (Retreat Supervisor) upholds the regulations and statutes, correcting transgressions and deviations. Their duty lies in impartiality, adhering to canonical law. Should any violation occur, they must issue a written reprimand. The offender, too, must accept punishment willingly.\n\nThe aim is that, outwardly, rites may be observed to preserve the solemnity of the assembly, while inwardly, one remains free of self-deception, avoiding lingering regret. During the process of correction, there must be no clamor or dispute. The one upholding the law must proceed with proper protocol; the guilty must not evade or resist. Such conduct not only offends the sages of the unseen realm but also invites ridicule from the assembly.\n\nNext, the *Shijing* (Scripture Attendants) maintain order in the altar space, overseeing the Dharma seat and the lecterns for scriptures and regulations. They arrange offerings, supplies, and furnishings, ensuring all is properly inspected.\n\nFormerly, within the retreat hall, two high seats were installed for the three daily sessions of lecturing and recitation. Thus, the *Jianyi* (Simplified Rites) states: “Three sessions of lecturing and chanting.” The *Zhijian* (Office Regulations) further states: “Guard the two lion seats.” The *Fajian* (Penalty Regulations) stipulates: “Those listening to the scriptures must not lean or rely on anything, nor hold tablets.” It also states: “Inquire about faulty verses.” These all clarify that, after the ritual proceedings conclude, the Dharma Master and officiants engage in the three daily sessions of lecturing and recitation.\n\nIn recent practice, however, the three daily rites are conducted solely within the altar space, with three sessions of circumambulation and three of scripture recitation. The tradition of lecturing and chanting has long faded, and the two high seats are no longer set up.\n\nDuring scripture recitation, the officiants take their seats. One attendant carries the purifying water, another tends the incense, and another handles the scriptures. After the recitation concludes, the *Shijing* retrieves the scriptures and returns them to their proper place, then arranges and sweeps the altar space, preparing for the offerings. They must ensure that outsiders do not trespass upon or defile the sacred altar—this is the *Shijing*’s duty.\n\nThey must not neglect their responsibilities, nor act with arrogance or irreverence. They must not allow lecterns to lie askew in the altar space, nor permit offerings to be soiled or mixed with profane items. They must not permit servants or laborers to enter the altar, thus offending the divine and transgressing the precepts.\n\nAfter the altar is sealed, passage is forbidden—yet servants, cooks, and attendants casually come and go. Such practices are common and must be strictly prohibited. Should they persist, the *Shijing* will bear the blame and punishment.\n\nThe duties of the *Shixiang* (Incense Attendants) are outlined in the liturgical texts. Yet in recent times, negligence has prevailed, and diligence has waned. Not only does the incense smoke often cease, but the fire frequently dies, leaving the ashes cold. Moreover, before the *Gaogong* has even ascended the altar, some officiants presumptuously add incense. Such deviations are widespread and must be corrected upon review of the rites and regulations.\n\nThe *Shideng* (Lamp Attendants) must remain diligent, ensuring the lamps are lit according to the rites, burning through the night and rekindled at dawn—only then do they fulfill their duty. Yet some unlearned and shallow individuals, instead of having the *Shijing* maintain the altar, have arbitrarily established a position called *Zhitan* (Altar Attendant), creating a superfluous role outside the six offices. Enlightened Dharma Masters should reject such innovations, lest they tread false paths and invite the scorn of future sages.\n\nFurthermore, according to the ancient rites of the *Jinlu* (Golden Register) and the old regulations of the *Huanglu* (Yellow Register), on the night of the preliminary invocation and during the declaration of merits, a *Ziran Chao* (Natural Audience) is first conducted before proceeding with the retreat rites. Thus, the *Qizhai Yi* (Retreat Invocation Rites) states: “The officiants, in succession, first perform the Natural Audience. After the Three Bows, they report to the retreat office, recite the precepts, and proclaim the regulations. At dawn the following day, they proceed with the rites according to the proper method.”\n\nThis practice has been transmitted from Master Zhang of Heaven, Master Lu, Master Kou of Heaven, and Master Zhang Qingdu, down to the present, spanning many generations. All regard the retreat rites as deriving from the *Lingbao* (Numinous Treasure) tradition, with the Natural Audience as the ancestral foundation of the retreat. Thus, it is performed first to demonstrate that the origin is not forgotten.\n\nYet some ignorant Daoists, failing to comprehend the intent of the ancient sages, first appoint the six offices and proclaim the regulations before the *Xuanshi* (Mystic Master), then ascend the altar, falsely claiming adherence to the retreat rites of Master Jianji. Their errors and distortions, their slanderous and illogical arguments, reveal a profound lack of understanding. Even worse, they have followers who imitate such practices.\n\nNot only do they incur the transgression of disordering the rites, but they also bear the sin of slandering the worthy. Those of discerning teaching should jointly reject such practices.\n\nAmong the old rites, there are transmitted errors: only at the moment of declaring the retreat’s merit, during the Natural Audience, should one pay homage to the *Lingbao Heavenly Worthy*. Yet the transmitted practice has been to pay homage to the *Jade Treasure August Supreme* and the like—this slightly deviates from the original intent of the Natural Audience. Perhaps due to the passage of long ages, scribal errors have crept in. In this ritual, corrections have now been made, not out of presumption, but as dictated by reason. May later worthies and those of the present age together propagate this.\n\n**Ritual Procedures for the Retreat Altar’s Chants and Responses**\n\nOn the night of the retreat’s commencement, the assembled officers take their positions before the *Mystic Master*. One is appointed to read the office assignments. Another leads the retreat sponsor to bow twice before the *Mystic Master*. Then, three pinches of incense are offered. After bowing twice more, the sponsor holds the petition case and states the retreat’s purpose. Having completed the statement, the sponsor bows again while holding the case, then turns, kneels, and presents the petition to the *High Merit*. After receiving the case, the retreat sponsor bows, and the *High Merit* returns the bow before retiring to his original position.\n\nNext, the *High Merit* holds the petition case before the *Mystic Master*. Three offerings of incense are made, followed by three bows. Holding the case upright, the *High Merit* formally announces the retreat’s commencement to the *Retreat Assembly*. Then, the *Three Refuges* are chanted. The *Assembly Leader* chants the *Universal Invocation*. The *Hua-Xia* guide leads the procession to the *Three Officials’* altar, where incense is offered. Then, to the *Three Masters’* altar, where incense is offered. The retreat officers are then invited to stand. The guide leads them to the *Earth Gate* and the *Prohibited Altar*. The *Gate-Incantation* is recited, and at the *Celestial Gate*, incense is offered to the *Ten Directions*. They return to their positions.\n\nThe *Assembly Leader* chants, and each officer bows to the masters while maintaining meditative focus as prescribed. The *Dharma Drum* is struck twenty-four times. Each announces their ritual rank. Then, the chant begins:\n\n*\"With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the*\n*Boundless Supreme of the Northern Realm,*\n*Lingbao Heavenly Worthy—*\n*Ten Directions as One.\"*\n\nNext, the *Refuge and Repentance* is chanted. Then, the *Three Karmas*. Then, the *Three Petitions*. The chanting of the rites proceeds.\n\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow our heads to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow our heads to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWith wholehearted reverence, we bow our heads to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.\n\nNext, the chant resumes, and ritual ranks are announced once more.\nNext, the *Great Thanksgiving Petition*.\nNext, the *Three Wisdom Heads* conclude.\nNext, the chant proclaims: \"All present bow body and head to the earth, turn their hearts, and pay homage to the Ten Directions, one bow to each.\"\nBeginning with the North, then the Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, North again, Above, and Below.\nAfter ten bows, they rise to stand.\n\nNext, the chant declares: \"All officers sit in even posture to receive the precepts of solemn dignity.\"\nNext, the precepts are recited.\nAfter the *Hymn of Receiving the Precepts* concludes, the chant proclaims three bows of reverence.\nNext, the *Assembly Leader* chants the appointment of offices: \"One is appointed as *High Merit Great Dharma Master*.\"\nHis office is such that his virtue fills him within, and his solemn dignity is complete without. His every movement and stillness follows the Dharma model, observed by humans and gods alike.\nThe Dharma Master bows, then kneels to receive the ritual tablet.\nNext, all officers receive their appointments.\nNext, the prohibitions are proclaimed.\n\nNext, the *Twelve Vows* are recited.\nNext, the incense burner is replenished.\nNext, the *Learning of Immortality* is performed.\nNext, the *Exiting the Chamber Mantra* is chanted.\nNext, the *Void and Vastness* is invoked.\nNext, before the *Mystic Master*, the *Assembly Leader* chants: \"The preceding rites of repentance and merit are thus concluded...\"\nNext, the chant proclaims: \"The *Fast Supervisor* examines transgressions; the *Fast Supervisor* rebukes and corrects as needed.\"\nAfter this is completed, the chant declares: \"The opening of the fast is concluded. All officers return to their positions.\"\n\nOn the first day at dawn, they stand in formation before the *Mystic Master*.\nThe *Assembly Leader* chants: \"All in the Daoist sanctuary, each direct your minds and take refuge in the Three Treasures with every thought.\"\nNext, they enter the altar.\nNext, the chant proclaims: \"Each bows to the master, contemplating and recollecting as prescribed.\"\nNext, the *Guardian Spirit Mantra* is recited.\nNext, the *Dharma Drum* is sounded twenty-four times.\nNext, the incense burner is kindled.\nNext, the chant proclaims: \"The *Dharma Drum* is sounded again twenty-four times as the officers and divine soldiers proceed.\"\nThe *Dharma Master* strikes the *Dharma Drum* to summon the officials—this is not done during the other eight hours.\nNext, the chant proclaims the titles of each office.\nNext, the three offerings of incense are completed.\nNext, all officers move to the left, stand at the west of the altar, and face east as they chant:\n\"With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the *Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy* of the Infinite East, the *Nine Qi Heavenly Lords*, and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Eastern Realm.\"\nThree bows are performed, each with reverent repentance.\nNext, kneeling, they read the *Eastern Realm Repentance*.\nNext, facing south, they chant:\n\"With utmost

They sat upon seven-jeweled thrones of seven hues. At that time, the Five Thearchic Great Sages, the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony, and the various perfected ones and great immortals—fifty-two thousand five hundred in all—came together before the thrones. Heaven rained fragrant blossoms, and divine dragons performed music. Countless hosts spread forth purple clouds on all sides, while the Three Luminaries shone in unison. The Primordial Era rejoiced in harmony, and the assembled perfected ones arrived in shared procession.\n\nThe Lord of the Dao, moved by compassion, desired to deliver all beings—whether male or female, those of earnest vows, or those of sincere heart—so that all might behold the emergence of the Numinous Treasure Dharma. Even those drawn to the Dharma Gate by good intentions were once, in the ten thousand kalpas of former lives, already devoted to the Most Perfected. Their merit complete and their virtue fulfilled, they were born into the world of the Dao. Now, encountering the flourishing of the Dharma, it is fitting to resolve their doubts and obstructions for them.\n\nThe Twelve Divisions of Scriptures refer to the twelve divisions of the Wondrous Cavern of the Central Dharma. Through these, you shall deliver the people of the ten directions and all heavens. Apply yourselves diligently, and let no demonic words deceive you.\n\nGuangting said: In ancient times, when the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning had already divided the Primal Chaos, the Three Qi unfolded the cosmic pattern. From the primordial essence of the Great Dao—the True One’s qi—were transformed the Numinous Treasure. The Red Writ coagulated into script, descending upon the Five Directions to pacify and stabilize heaven and earth, and to summon the perfected and the numinous. Thus it is said: heaven and earth receive it to be pacified and stabilized; sun and moon receive it to shine with radiance; ghosts and spirits receive it to be delivered and enlightened; and the people receive it to attain longevity. The True Writ has been bequeathed to the world: above, it dissolves celestial calamities and safeguards the emperors; below, it wards off poisonous harm and delivers the multitudes. It subdues gods and demons, rescues the sunken and drowning, and accomplishes all without exception. As the scripture says: “Without the Writ, there is no illumination; without the Writ, there is no clarity; without the Writ, there is no establishment; without the Writ, there is no completion; without the Writ, there is no deliverance; without the Writ, there is no life.” It is also said: “The Red Writ of Jade Characters and the Eight Mighty Dragon Script preserve and regulate the kalpic destiny, ensuring the heavens endure forever.” Such are the wondrous functions of the Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure and the True Writ. Thus they rectify the celestial divisions and harmonize yin and yang; deliver the flying souls and protect the emperors; rescue the drowning and aid the submerged; bridge the hidden and the manifest; reconcile grievances and absolve transgressions; avert death and prolong life. The sufferings of life and death are all saved without exception.\n\nWhen establishing a retreat, the True Writ and Jade Characters are installed to pacify the Five Directions. Upon the conclusion of the altar rites, the Writ is gathered and burned. The ashes are scattered amidst the azure smoke, all in accordance with the Jade Instructions. Should a scholar-practitioner cultivate the Real and seek deliverance for themselves, inscribing their name in the registers of immortality, they shall forever depart the ghostly realms. On the days of the Three Primes, the Eight Nodes, the jiazi, or their own life-destiny day, they shall inscribe the Writ upon jade tablets and cast them into renowned mountains, thereby erasing the karmic ledgers of past lives. Their names ascend to heaven, and each matter is thrice presented before the heavens. The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus record their meritorious deeds. Above, they are distinguished by the heavens; ten thousand spirits revere and protect them; the Five Emperors attend them; and the Three Realms’ administrators welcome them. A thousand demons and ten thousand spirits dare not rashly intrude. As the scripture says: “With resolve firm and unwavering, all endeavors toward the Dao shall succeed.” Seven generations of ancestors ascend to the celestial palaces, and the blessings of life and death respond in kind.\n\n**First Talisman: The Azure Emperor of the East, Command of the Numinous Treasure True Writ**\nThe Jade Characters of the East, twenty-four in number.

The incantation reads:\n\nThe Primordial of the Upper Heavens, the Three Luminaries’ radiant clarity,\nrevolves its light to illumine the four directions in profound purity.\nWhere the celestial

pacify state and people, each method follows the afflicted direction.\nLight lamps to illumine the myriad heavens: if the calamity lies in the east, light nine lamps—or ninety, or nine hundred.\nUse one Golden Dragon and ninety bolts of blue silk, performing the rite for nine days and nights.\nIf the calamity lies in the south, light three lamps—or thirty, or three hundred—\none Golden Dragon, and thirty bolts of crimson silk, performing the rite for three days and nights.\nIf the calamity lies in the center, light twelve lamps—or one hundred twenty, or one thousand two hundred—\none Golden

subdue the demonic hordes of the Northern Feng.\nThe Vermilion Script’s Upper Writ states:\nThose who receive the Numinous Treasure’s supreme method entice divine luminaries to descend.\nThrough concentrated visualization, their resonance reaches the heavens, enabling communion with celestial perfected.\nFirst distinguish the forms of demonic hordes:\nblock their trials and tests, subdue

rites in the northeast of the state, capital, commandery, or territory.\nPractice with concentrated mind: demonic hordes will be crushed and subdued, the state pacified, the people tranquilized.\nHold

calamity.\nThe Dao declares:\nWhen the great kalpa’s calamity befalls heaven and earth, floodwaters surge from all directions,\nscouring filth and eradicating evil, leaving none behind.\nAt such times, heaven and earth merge in darkness, the people drift without distinction of good or ill.\nOnly those devoted scholars who obtain the Numinous Treasure’s true writ—\nthe talismans for great and small kalpas—\nmay ride feathered wings to ascend and observe from on high, or climb numinous peaks and soar.\nAt such times, divine beings shall act on their behalf:\ncommand the flood dragons to open waterways, clearing paths for their passage,\nwhile the River Earl oversees their crossing, sparing them the need for bridges or ferries.\nThe true writ’s numinous subtlety transcends even the great kalpa’s calamity.\nShould one encounter such a time, follow the writ’s instructions.\nFace the water’s northern position, strike the teeth five times, and open the breath’s closure.\nHold the breath for twenty-five cycles, visualizing one’s body and mind.\nFire arises within, emerging from the crown of the head to burn the four directions’ mountains, forests, grasses, trees, and one’s own

according to the writ may also rescue the drowning multitudes,\nsaving the myriad beings from sinking into ruin.\n\nThus did the Great Yu obtain it, summoning spirits and calling forth dragons to channel the hundred rivers, accomplishing his work of flood control. The incantation reads:\n\nThe Five Phases spur one another,\ntheir revolving measures governed by yang.\nYin and yang clash in obstruction,\ncongealing into calamitous surges.\nThe great kalpa’s end is reached,\nsweeping away filth and dispelling miasma.\nThe Nine Rivers receive their reckoning,\nas deluge surges through the channels.\nThe Water Mother lingers,\nbirds and horses gather in flocks.\nSun and moon meet in darkness,\nthe Three Luminaries halt at the pass.\nThe chosen seed-people are selected,\ntheir jade texts compared and examined.\nEvil is cast off, good preserved,\nthe pure and turbid forever parted.\nI partake in the Emperor’s decree,\nmy name inscribed among the Nine Heavens.\nWhen the fourfold great disasters converge,\nthe Red Writ absolves them all.\n\nOn this day, proclaim the command to the myriad spirits,\nthat all may hear: the Nine Rivers’ water palaces, the vast and abyssal deities,\nopen the waterways, clear the river fords.\nDragons respond to the talisman,\nseizing mountains to send forth clouds.\nBearing me, escorting me,\nthey gallop in all four directions.\nCinnabar script in vermilion characters,\nthe Primordial One’s true writ.\nGolden dragons swiftly present it,\nunceasing in every moment.\n\nStanding, make the report to the throne,\nfacing the August Honored One above.\nWhen complete, draw in the breath twenty-five times and swallow it.\nIn an instant, the gods of passage shall arrive\nto ferry the practitioner’s body across.\nIf in the mountains, the mountains shall float;\nif in the waters, the waters shall part.\nThis may be called delivering from peril in the blink of a minnow’s eye.\n\nWhen prefectures and kingdoms suffer water disasters, one may also establish a fast. Inscribe the texts with utmost care, and perform the rites accordingly.\n\nAt the beginning of kalpas without number, the Heavenly Worthy moved the primordial qi and true essence, transforming and giving birth to numinous scriptures to govern the turning of kalpas, protect the state, and pacify the people. Those born under the Zi constellation are blessed, their fortune bound to good causes. Thus do they encounter these texts.\n\nThe people of high antiquity were pure and harmonious, embracing simplicity. They merged with the Dao, and without awaiting fasts or precepts, their practice brought immediate response. In this degenerate age, human hearts are scattered and corrupted. Few uphold the true, while many stray from it. Those who wish to practice this method must follow the writs of the Three Primes, establish the fast, perform the Dao, and concentrate their minds with utmost sincerity. Only then may they inwardly align with the mysterious sages and achieve spiritual resonance. Without this, demonic trials will obstruct them, and their efforts will be in vain.\n\nSelect those of purity and integrity, in places untouched by worldly dust—sacred mountains and numinous sites—to await the response. Thus shall the great Dao’s compassion in delivering beings and the Most High’s grace in saving all be made manifest.\n\nLet those who propagate this transformation exert themselves!\n\nCompiled on the Zhongyuan day of the Gengzi year.\n*Tai Shang Huang Lu Zhai Yi*, Scroll Fifty-Four Concludes\n*Tai Shang Huang Lu Zhai Yi*, Scroll Fifty-Five Begins\n\nMaster Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting, *Ritual for Offering Dragon and Jade Disc* – *Lingxian Section of the Lower Yuan Huanglu Writs* states:\n\nTo deliver beings from the roots of sin, once all fasts and rites of majestic decorum are complete, follow the Red Writs and Jade Formulas, inscribe cinnabar upon the *jin* tablets, bind them with golden dragons and blue-green silk, and present them to the numinous mountains and Five Peaks. The pledge of ascension shall be sealed within the recesses of sheer cliffs. All must accord with the prescribed method.\n\n*Lingxian Section of the Lower Yuan Huanglu Writs* states:\n\nWhen the rites invoking the Five Thearchs’ majesty are complete, take one cinnabar-inscribed jade tablet and one golden dragon, bind them with blue-green silk, and cast them into the Three Rivers to present to the Water Thearch. The pledge of ascension must fully adhere to the jade formulas and written statutes.\n\n*Lingxian Section of the Lower Yuan Huanglu Writs* states:\n\nWhen the rites for the Water Thearch are complete, take nine jade tablets, golden dragons, and golden knots, bind them with blue-green silk, and bury them at the altar site to report and covenant with the Earth Officials. All must follow the regulations as stated.\n\n*Zhenxian Section of the Upper Yuan Jinlu Writs* states:\n\nTo deliver beings from the bonds of life and death, when the fast’s rites of majestic decorum are observed, place five golden dragons atop the True Writs of the Five Directions. Upon completion, cast them into the mountains and waters.\n\n*Lingxian Section of the Lower Yuan Huanglu Writs* states:\n\nFor the rites of majestic decorum to deliver beings from the roots of sin, use refined gold to fashion ten golden dragons to guard the Ten Directions. To deliver the flying souls, place one dragon at each of the ten directions.\n\n*Yugui Mingzhen Ke* states:\n\nWhen performing the precious Huanglu fast, use three *liang* of refined gold to cast three dragons, each weighing one *liang*. The state employs refined gold; dukes, ministers, and high officials use secondary gold; scholars, commoners, and the people may use silver, copper, or gilded substitutes, supplemented with jade tablets (the *yu zha*). Inscribe upon them the purpose of the fast, the state’s name, the year of the Great Year, the month and day, the Dharma master’s name, and the location of the offering. Cast them into renowned mountains and grottoes, numinous springs and dragon caves, or at the fast’s altar or dwelling place to report and covenant with the Three Bureaus of Heaven, Earth, and Water, allowing them to witness and verify the fast’s merit. Should any be omitted, the Nine Departments of the Earth Officials shall hold them accountable.\n\nThe regulations state: The dragon rides the clouds and qi, governs yin and yang. When united, it forms a body; when dispersed, it becomes patterns. Its transformations are unfathomable—it enters the earth and ascends to heaven. Thus, in the Thirty-Six Heavens, the realm of utmost yang, it serves as the courier to transmit messages and communicate with the mysterious and numinous. Is there anything but the dragon that can achieve this? The dragon is a yang creature. Of all things used by heaven, none surpasses the dragon; of those used by earth, none surpasses the tortoise; of those used by humans, none surpasses the horse. Therefore, the heavens employ dragons as their couriers, traversing between the heavens and the human realm. Gold, the noblest of the five metals, is unyielding and incorruptible—a treasure of heaven and earth that communicates with the numinous and harmonizes with the divine. Thus, refined gold is used to cast them in the dragon’s form. Cast into grottoes and palaces, they serve as pledges to covenant with the Three Primes. The true officials of the grottoes and palaces, along with their subordinate offices, receive the dragon pledges and written tablets, record the meritorious deeds, and memorialize them to the Most High Sages. The response to resonance is like a shadow following form. Those who cultivate and uphold these rites must not omit them.\n\nThe regulations state: The tablet (*jian*) serves to report, record, and inscribe. It records the world’s good deeds and reports them to the Perfected Ones. Its length is one *chi* and two *cun*, symbolizing the twelve earthly branches. Its width is two *cun* and four *fen*, corresponding to the twenty-four true qi. Its thickness is two *fen*, representing the Two Modes (yin and yang). Its top and bottom are square, symbolizing the sun’s square shadow. It is upright and unobstructed, yielding to nothing. The state uses jade for its tablets, for jade possesses nine virtues and may be used to ritualize heaven and earth. As a pledge to the divine spirits, jade is thus employed. Dukes, ministers, and commoners all use *jin* wood, for its purity and fine texture may be likened to jade, clarifying the distinctions of rank.\n\nThe regulations state: The jade disc (*bi*) is the treasure used to ritualize heaven, earth, and mountains and rivers, and is made of jade. When offering to mountains and rivers, use one round disc. Its color is azure, its diameter three *cun*, with a hollow center. The mountain tablet serves as a pledge to the Nine Heavens, so an azure disc is used, symbolizing heaven. When offering to water tablets, use a six-pointed disc. Its color is black, its diameter three *cun*, with a hollow center. The water tablet serves as a pledge to the Nine Seas and Water Officials, so a dark disc is used, representing the color of water. The six points correspond to the number of water. When offering to earth tablets, use a yellow disc. It is square, with a diameter of two *cun* and a hollow center. The earth tablet serves as a pledge to the Nine Lands. Yellow is the color of earth, and square is the shape of earth. The disc and dragon accompany the sealed tablet, bound with blue-green silk.\n\nThe regulations state: For the method of casting the three tablets, use nine golden knots to accompany the tablets. For three tablets, twenty-seven knots are used. The golden knots replace the blood oath, and the blue-green silk replaces the cutting of hair. To forge a covenant and convey sincerity, nothing is more weighty. Thus, the blue-green silk binds the knots, disc, tablet, and dragon before casting them. For the state, gold is used for the knots; for ministers and commoners, silver or copper gilded in gold may suffice. The knots have a diameter of nine *fen*, with their outer edges rounded like rings.\n\nThe regulations state: Upon completing the fast, select an auspicious day, or a day of purity during the fast. Prepare offerings, feasts, and ritual implements for the Dharma master, officials, and the fast’s host and disciples. Either board a boat to reach water grottoes or ascend by land to mountain gates. Outside the grottoes and palaces, clear the grass, sweep, and purify the area, then arrange the ritual mats, wine, fruits, delicacies, venison, broth, and tea. The state uses sixty-four portions; ministers and commoners use twenty-four. Follow the solemn ritual decorum: don ceremonial robes, bathe, and pay homage to the ritual proceedings, adhering strictly to the prescribed forms. The local divine officials and supervising generals shall act as intermediaries, reporting to the immortal offices within the grottoes to communicate the fast’s tablets. Thus, blessings and good fortune shall swiftly manifest. Do not fail to report and simply cast the tablets into the grottoes, for without reaching the true numina, one shall incur punishment instead. If the mountain or water grottoes are distant and the master and assembly cannot all attend or ascend, select one or two ritual officers from the altar, along with disciples, to carry the tablets to the grottoes. Perform the offerings and reports as in the original ritual.\n\nIf the state performs the *Investiture of the Dragon* ritual, the Five Marchmounts and various mountains each have their own golden dragon protocols, which differ in complexity from these ordinary rites. Should the fasting patrons—whether due to public or private constraints—be unable to personally attend the grotto-palaces, they may select one individual of utmost sincerity, reverence, and devout diligence to perform the rites in their stead. If no such proxy can be found, the master shall act as intermediary to report on their behalf. Under no circumstances may the tablets be concealed or the matter prolonged. Once the covenant of report and oath is made, the local divine officials shall record and memorialize it; the offense for failure is no trifling matter—utmost caution is required.\n\nUpon arriving at the grotto site, choose level ground outside the entrance—or a boat, or a stone surface—and ensure it is swept clean and purified to establish the ritual space. Prepare five mats of pure cloth, five ritual towels, blue and plain cloths, and offerings of wine, tea, and hot water. Arrange five trays of seasonal fruits, pastries, and delicacies: sixty-four for the state, twenty-four for officials and commoners. Set out four incense burners, four burner cloths, and four tables. Once the arrangements are complete, sprinkle the area beyond the altar with fragrant water to dispel noxious influences and ward off impurities, as in standard ritual procedure.\n\nMaster and disciples alike must bathe and purify themselves. Solemnity and reverence take precedence; laxity, clamor, or irreverence are forbidden. Violations shall incur severe penalties.\n\nEach shall pay homage to the master, contemplating the proper visualization: next, invoke the Three Honored Ones, the scriptural treasures, the Transcendent Masters, the Five Stars, the Five Earths, the Five Marchmounts, the Five Treasuries, the Five Spirits, the scriptural and ordination masters. Envision the three-colored clouds of qi, the grotto-palace of the locale, the true immortals and divine administrators, the supervising officials, and the land spirits on duty—all seated in solemn array, clearly manifest. Conclude as prescribed in the fasting ritual.\n\n*Guardian Spirits.*\n\nThe Five Spirits take their positions, resplendent in guard of the five directions. The August Sovereign shields the soul; the Cinnabar Elder protects the form. The Radiant Spirit attends the po; the Dark Emperor sustains life. The Yellow Emperor of the Center commands the myriad perfected. The Primordial August One issues his decree, and the light of the hidden night unfolds. Sins dissolve in the Northern Bureau; names are inscribed in the Southern Prosperity. The Golden Register fixes one’s destiny; the Jade Script dispels calamity. The Vermilion Mound refines the substance; the spirit soars to the Great Azure. The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the boundless divine realm—all universally receive deliverance and ascend to the celestial halls.\n\nSound the ritual drum twenty-four times.\nOpen the incense burner.\n\nMost High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Supreme Lord Lao: summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendant Messengers of the Left and Right, the Dragon-Riding Couriers of the Left and Right, the Incense-Bearing Golden Lads, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-six each. Now summon the local earth deities and the mountain and river spirits to swiftly appear, don their solemn attire, and attend the memorial.\n\nThis servant now burns incense and offers the Yellow Register Precious Retreat on behalf of so-and-so, having completed the merit and concluded the rites, submitting the document to the numinous mountain. May the Primordial Qi of the Supreme Ten Directions’ True and Upright Ones enter the bodies of this servant and company. May this petition swiftly ascend to the presence of the Supreme, the Boundless Dao, the Kunlun and Five Marchmounts, the numinous mountains and grotto-palaces.\n\nEach declares their ritual rank.\n\nThis humble servant so-and-so and company reverently invoke the Great Luo, the Jade Purity, the Boundless, the Most High and True Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin; the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Supreme Lord Lao; the thirty-six divisions of the honored scriptures; the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center; the Three Treasures and all sacred hosts. May they deign to descend in compassion. We bow our heads and prostrate ourselves again.\n\nWe reverently invoke the perfected immortals of such-and-such grotto-palace, the officials of the grotto-heavens, the attained perfected ones. May they deign to descend in radiance.\n\nWe reverently invoke the local governing deities, the overseers of the void, the incense officials and messengers, the mighty spirits of the Three Caverns, the true officials of the precinct, the guardian generals and officers, the spirits of mountains, waters, rivers, and marshes—all the proper deities, each in their official capacity, to descend.\n\nNext, offer the three pinches of upper-grade incense.\nPresent the wine.\n\nKneeling in reverence, each announcing their dharmic rank, your humble servant [Name], in full devotion, respectfully addresses the Most High and Boundless Dao, the Three Venerable Ones of the Supreme; the hosts of Great Sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions; the Perfected Lords and Masters; the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, and Northern Perfected; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Sacred Scriptures; the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center; the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate; the Three Perfected of the Mysterious Unity; the deities of the heavens, sun, moon, and constellations; the immortals of the Kunlun Upper Palace; the Golden Mother of the Western Numinous; the Perfected Lords of the Five Marchmounts; the rightful officials of the Sacred Mountains; the Hidden and Flourishing Lords in Reserve; the Elder of Mount Qingcheng; the Envoys of Mount Lu; the Obscure and Lofty of Mount Zhong; the Western Mysterious Pond and Terrace; the great spirits of the mounds and mountains; the Three Officials of the Northern Realm; the Six Palaces of the Nether Bureau; the deities above the earth and below the heavens; the numinous spirits of the unseen; the overseers of life and keepers of records; the Three Southern Gates; the supremely divine and numinous; and all the assembled immortals.\n\nThis humble servant, born of dust and defilement, blind and ignorant, has, through the good affinities of ten thousand kalpas, relied upon and followed the transformative power of the Dao. Reverently receiving the compassionate teachings, I have aided the state and established merit, saved beings and delivered people, propagated the Dao, and upheld the Dharma.\n\nShould the transmission of scriptures and registers be conducted on this day, the [day/month/year], the disciple shall approach a Master of the Three Caverns, the Perfected One of [such-and-such] Sacred Peak, [so-and-so], to receive the *True Writings of the Five Venerable Ones*, the *Vermilion Scriptures of the Numinous Chapters*, the *Eight Sceneries of the Three Divisions*, the *Inner Sounds of the Myriad Heavens*, the *Two Registers of Divine Immortals*, the *Eight Might-Inspiring Writs*, the *Tally-Staves of the Five Thearchs*, and the *True Scriptures of the Central Alliance*. Upon completion of the transmission, the disciple shall present a memorial tablet at the Numinous Mountain, offering it with a golden clasp. Thereafter, no further clasps shall be used—these four characters are to be omitted.\n\nThe *Golden Dragon Courier Transmission*.\nThe *Yellow Register Memorial Tablet* states: Humbly offered on behalf of the official [so-and-so] and [such-and-such], who has established the Great Yellow Register Retreat for the sake of state and family, extending blessings to both the living and the deceased. Seeking forgiveness of sins and imploring grace, dissolving calamities and misfortunes.\n\nUpon the conclusion of the ritual, the memorial tablet shall be presented at the Numinous Mountain, transmitted via the *Golden Dragon Courier*, beseeching the erasure of sins from the records and the inscription of names in the *Jade Registers*. May the divine and immortal ones release the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages of kin, the departed and the transformed, redeeming their evil roots and delivering them from the Fengdu and Mount Tai, the Twenty-Four Prisons, the Courts of the Five Sacred Peaks, the Nine Dark Realms, the Knife Mountains and Sword Trees, and the lands of suffering and affliction. May their souls behold the radiant light and forever receive deliverance. May they be transformed through the wheel of rebirth, entering the gates of bliss. May their tombs remain undisturbed, and lawsuits cease. May the entire household receive blessings, and all be indebted to this grace. May malevolent spirits be eradicated, and auspicious omens arise daily. May those who cultivate the Dao and seek the Perfected attain immortal ranks forever. Should these prayers be granted, we shall ever bear the profound grace of the Mysterious.\n\nThis humble servant, [so-and-so], with reverence and awe, bows twice in prostration.\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nNext, rise and hold the memorial tablet, fumigating it with incense.\nKnock the teeth nine times.\n\nAfter reciting the memorial text, seal it with blue paper, binding it with azure silk and the dragon clasp, jade, and other tokens.\nThe disciple shall hold it over the incense while the master recites the incantation:\n\n*\"The Mysterious Above opens and illumines; the Primordial Beginning oversees the Perfected.\nThe Five Venerable Ones of the Thearchs, the Vermilion Scripts of the Cinnabar Writings.\nThe origin of Heaven and Earth, governing the Three Primes.\nGathering qi and summoning assemblies, hastening the pursuit of immortality.\nThe exalted tally-commands, universally proclaimed to the ten directions.\nThe sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the numinous mountains of the Five Peaks.\nAbove the heavens and below the earth, the great spirits of the boundless depths.\nThe overseers of life and keepers of records, the Three Southern Gates.\nPresiding over the Jade Tablets, inscribing names in the Cinnabar Chapters.\nErasing the records of sins, ascending to serve as ministers of the Thearch.\nRelying upon the Supreme Dao, establishing merit through the retreat.\nRedeeming the nine generations of ancestors, all suffering souls.\nUpon the completion of the ritual, reverently following the Numinous Mountain’s decree,\nPresenting the Jade Tablet, beseeching the erasure of sinful names.\nMay all attain liberation, without enmity or kinship.\nDeparting the Three Evil Realms, ascending to the Nine Heavens.\nDelivered from life and death, enduring for a hundred million kalpas.\nToday’s supplication is heard by the myriad Perfected.\nPresenting the Dragon Tablet, pledging alliance with the Perfected Officials.\nMay the prayers be granted, transmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier.\"*\n\nUpon the conclusion of the incantation, the assembled officials shall bow twice more.\nNext, cast the tablet into the grotto.\n\n*Ode to the Dragon Tablet*\nThree bows.\nReturn to the incense burner.\n*Hymn to the Pursuit of Immortality*\nWithdraw the offerings.\n\n**Method for Casting the Water Tablet**\n\nHaving paid homage to the master, visualize as prescribed.\n*Guardian of the Numinous* is invoked.\nThe ritual drum is sounded twenty-four times.\n\nThe Most High Three Heavens, the Primordial Origin, the Three Qi of the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, summon forth from within this servant’s body:\nthe Three and Five Merit Officers,\nthe Left and Right Attendant Envoys,\nthe Left and Right Fragrant-Bearing Dragon Courier Scribes,\nthe Golden Lads of Incense,\nthe Jade Maidens of Transmission,\nand the Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants and Daily Fragrant Officers—\nthirty-six each—are to emerge.\n\nSummon now the local earth deities and territorial spirits, the Perfected Officials and true gods, to swiftly appear, arrayed in solemn attire, and open the sacred barrier.\n\nThis servant now burns incense and casts the tablet, praying that the life-generating qi of the Supreme Ten Directions’ True and Perfected may enter his body, that his petition may swiftly ascend to the presence of the Supreme Limitless Dao’s Radiant Valley Divine King and the Water Thearchs of the Nine Rivers’ Water Palace.\n\nEach performs three bows.\nEach declares his ritual rank.\n*Descend, O Perfected.*\n\nKneeling in reverence, this servant humbly petitions:\n\nThis servant reverently addresses the Supreme Limitless Dao, the Three Supreme Honored Ones of the Supreme,\nthe Great Sage Hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao,\nthe Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters,\nthe Eastern Florescence and Southern Culmen,\nthe Western Numinous and Northern True,\nthe Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures,\nthe Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm,\nthe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate,\nthe Three Perfected of the Mystic Unity,\nthe Sun, Moon, and Five Planets,\nthe Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper,\nthe Five Marchmounts and Four Quarters,\nthe Sun’s Cavern of Eternal Yang,\nthe Radiant Valley’s Grotto of Yin,\nthe Divine Lords and Sage Hosts,\nthe Great Emperor of Fusang,\nthe Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital,\nthe Three Rivers and Four Seas,\nthe Nine Rivers and Huai Marshes,\nthe Three Officials and Nine Palaces,\nthe Twelve River Sources,\nthe Nine Palaces’ Water Thearchs,\nthe Great Spirits of the Vast Cold,\nthe Water Palace Immortals,\nand all assembled numina.\n\nThis servant, born of humble clay in the lower realms, endowed with a meager and common intellect, has by karmic affinity with the Dao encountered this sagely dispensation. The Numinous Treasure has bestowed its teachings, the Great Dharma has delivered humankind. Assisting the state and establishing merit, he upholds the benevolent instructions. Having received the scriptures and registers—on this day, month, and year, he approached the Three Caverns’ Dharma Master, the Perfected of Such-and-Such Marchmount, so-and-so, who transmitted to him the Five Venerable Perfected of the Numinous Treasure, the Scarlet Writ of the Numinous Chapters, the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences, the Inner Sounds of All Heavens, the Two Registers of Divine Immortals, the Eight Might Commandments, the Five Thearchs’ Talismanic Staffs, the Central Alliance Scriptures, and the transmission of all rites—now complete.\n\nHe casts the Dragon Tablet into the limpid spring, fastening it with a golden clasp. If no golden clasp is used, omit these four characters.\nTransmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier.\n\nUpon the completion of the Yellow Register Retreat, this servant, on behalf of such-and-such official, so-and-so, has conducted the Yellow Register Grand Retreat for the state and the household, universally encompassing the living and the deceased. He prays for grace and offers thanks, beseeching blessings and the dissolution of calamities, the resolution of enmities, and the augmentation of life and fortune. With the rites now concluded, he casts the tablet into the numinous spring. Transmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier, he petitions the erasure from the ledgers of death, the dissolution of sins, and the inscription of life. May the divine and immortal grant renewal. May the Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors be delivered from the roots of suffering, departing the Radiant Valley and the dark, frigid realms of the nether night. Bathed and refined, may they ascend to the heavens. May tombs be secure and felicitous, inauspicious entries forever obliterated. May the entire household receive blessings, their divine qi at rest and serene. May learning and discernment be illuminated, wisdom perfected and radiant. May the true Dharma be proclaimed, treachery and malevolence subdued. May the Three Realms bear witness to their deliverance, their merit fulfilled and conduct complete. May the emperor be secure and the state prosper. This servant humbly submits this petition, praying it be granted as stated.\n\nThis servant, with awe and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice.\nHumbly submitted.\n\nNext, the tablet is held and fumigated over the incense. The teeth are clicked three times. After the tablet’s text is read, it is sealed with blue paper, bound with azure silk, and affixed with the dragon clasp and jade ornaments. The disciple holds it over the incense while the master recites the incantation:\n\nThe Five Venerables of the Primordial Origin, exalted lords of the Highest,\nThe Perfected of the Ten Directions, the numinous immortals of Mount Taihua.\nThe Scarlet Writ proclaims the mandate, no hidden realm is untouched.\nAscending to the Nine Heavens, petitioning the descent of the Jade Text.\nThe Sun, Moon, and Five Planets,\nThe Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper.\nPetitioning the Five Marchmounts at the center,\nThe numinous mountains of the Four Quarters.\nPetitioning the rivers and seas below,\nThe Twelve Fountainheads.\nThe Water Thearchs of the Nine Palaces,\nThe Great Spirits of the Vast Cold.\nToday’s supplication is heard,\nAll vows are declared.\nConducting the retreat and performing the Dao,\nUniversally for the living and the dead.\nPraying for the redemption of the Seven Ancestors,\nThe roots of karmic transgressions.\nReverently casting the Jade Tablet,\nPraying it be heard above.\nInscribed in the Water Palace,\nAscending to heaven in the past.\nDelivered from life and death,\nAll spirits hear the plea.\nPresenting the Dragon Tablet,\nPledging alliance with the Water Thearchs.\nGrant as petitioned,\nTransmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier.\n\nThe incantation concluded, the assembled officials bow twice more.\nNext, cast the tablet into the Water Palace.\nChant the *Ode to the Dragon Tablet*.\nThree bows.\nReturn to the incense burner.\n\nThe *Hymn to Lesser Immortals* concludes, dispersed as in the usual rite. The *Method for Casting the Earth Tablet* follows. Each bows to the master, visualizing as prescribed.\n\n**Guardian of the Numinous**\nTwenty-four strikes of the Dharma Drum.\n\nTo the Most High Three Heavens, the Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, the Supreme Lord Lao: summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Left and Right Fragrant-Bearing Dragon Courier Scribes, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Thirty-Six Fragrant Officers of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Registers for the Day.\n\nAt once summon the local Earth Gods and Domain Spirits, the True Officers and Righteous Deities, to swiftly emerge, array themselves, and open the gates.\n\nThis servant now burns incense and casts the tablet, praying that the Primordial Qi of the Ten Directions’ True and Upright Ones enter this body, that this petition swiftly ascend and directly reach the presence of the Most High Boundless Dao, the Nine Lands’ August Spirit of the Earth Mansion, and the Great Deities of the Underworld.\n\nEach performs three bows.\nNext, each declares their Dharma rank.\nThen, facing the southwest, they descend in truth.\nNext, kneeling in full prostration, they intone:\n\nThis servant reverently petitions the Most High Boundless Dao, the Supreme Three Worthies, the Ten Directions’ Perfected Great Sages, the Most Real Lords and Venerable Ones, the Eastern Flowery Radiance, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, the Five Elder Thearchs, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, the Three Perfected of the Mysterious Unity, the Great Emperor of Fengdu, the Nine Mansion Palaces, the Masters of the Yellow Springs and Crooked Springs, the August High Thearch of the Boundless Realm, the Nine Lands’ August Spirit of the Seasons, the Central August, the Nine Lands’ Earth Gods of the Central Yellow, the Five Thearchs of the Earth Mansion, the officials of the Three Realms, the local Earth Gods and Domain Spirits, the True Officers and Righteous Deities, and all numinous spirits of this abode and dwelling.\n\nThis servant, born of coarse qi and foolish nature, has by karmic fortune encountered the True Dharma and auspicious causes. At the opening of the Numinous Treasure’s radiance and the proclamation of the Red Writ, this unworthy one was permitted to attend the Perfected. Aiding the state and serving the times, establishing merit and propagating the teachings, this servant received the Register of the Dharma on such-and-such a day, month, and year, from the Three Caverns’ Dharma Master, the Perfected of Such-and-Such Peak. The transmission included the Five Elder Perfected Texts, the Red Writ Numinous Chapters, the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences, the Inner Sounds of All Heavens, the Two Registers of Gods and Immortals, the Eight Might Commandments, the Five Thearchs’ Talismanic Staffs, the Central Alliance Scriptures, and other texts. The transmission complete, the tablet is cast into the Central Palace, inscribed with a golden clasp—omitting the phrase “afterward twice without clasp” and these four characters.\n\nTransmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier.\n\nThe Yellow Register Retreat’s sponsor, on behalf of such-and-such an official or such-and-such a person, has established the Great Yellow Register Retreat for state and family, universally for the living and the dead. To dissolve calamities, atone for transgressions, pray for blessings, and beseech grace. The Daoist rites concluded, the tablet is cast upon the numinous altar, transmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier.\n\nPray that the Earth Tablet erase transgressions and remove sins. May vows be fulfilled and lives preserved, bodies safeguarded. May names be inscribed in the Jade Calendar of the Nine Elder Immortals’ Capital. May the nine generations of ancestors, parents, karmic kin of countless kalpas, the previously and recently deceased, all partake of blessed causes. May they depart from the Nine Darks below, the Eight Gates’ realm, the earth prisons’ interiors, and the midst of suffering. May their calamitous records dissolve, their tombs and dwellings be purified. May evil roots be severed, and may they ascend to the Hall of Blessings. May this servant’s studies be perfected, merits and deeds resplendent. May life and death share in fortune, eternal protection without peril. May the emperor receive blessings, the world know peace.\n\nThis servant reverently petitions, praying for compassionate response. With utmost awe and trepidation, this servant kowtows twice more. Respectfully submitted.\n\nNext, the tablet’s text is held and fumigated over incense. Twelve knocks of the teeth.\nThe tablet’s text read, it is sealed with yellow paper, bound with azure silk, and adorned with a dragon clasp and jade disk. The disciple holds it over the incense while the master intones:\n\nHeaven and Earth unfold,\nMyriad darknesses part, spirits divide.\nThe Three Origins unite in tally,\nThe Ten Directions shine in clarity.\nThe Five Peaks ascend in report,\nMasters of death, stewards of life.\nCinnabar Writ, Red Text,\nPrimordial Scripture of the Most High.\nUniversally proclaimed to the Supreme,\nThe Nine Lands’ August Spirits.\nToday’s supplication is heard,\nAll immortals’ lives are secured.\nConducting the retreat and performing the Dao,\nUniversally for the living and the dead.\nThis servant’s vow, this servant’s immortality,\nPray cast the jade name.\nEarth Mansion’s August Thearch,\nInscribe and remove the sentence of punishment.\nPetition the Upper Palace,\nEngrave the register in the Flowery Clarity.\nMay this body ascend in flight,\nHeaven and Earth share in numinosity.\nNine generations of karmic kin,\nRotten bones renewed in glory.\nSouls ascend to the Southern Palace,\nRefined in the Immortals’ Court.\nToday’s decree proclaimed,\nAll spirits hear the plea.\nPray with the golden clasp,\nManifest utmost sincerity.\nGrant as petitioned,\nTransmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier.\n\nThe incantation concluded, the assembled officials bow twice more.\nNext, cast the tablet into the altar’s center or beneath the lunar station.\nChant the *Ode to the Dragon Tablet*.\nThree bows.\n\nThe furnace is restored. Upon concluding the *Primary School of Immortals’ Hymns*, disperse this earthen tablet. On the night of merit’s proclamation, after the recitation of incantations and hymns, by dawn it may be buried within the altar—no further petition or announcement is required. Here, following the rites of Master Zhang Chengguang, three tablets are presented for petition, each corresponding to a distinct true rank; thus, they are recorded again.\n\nIf within the altar of the purification fast, only the proclamation of merit is made, and at the time of the libation the incantation is recited, the tablet may then be cast. As for the mountain and water tablets, though proclaimed with the merit’s announcement and the incantation concluded, if a libation is set at the grotto’s site, one must proceed in proper sequence: each is recited, sealed with incantation, and then cast. This ensures completeness; one must not, having petitioned within the altar, proceed directly to the mountain and cast them at will. The true spirits may fail to acknowledge receipt, the merit may not reach its destination, and the loss would be grave—utmost care and deliberation are essential.\n\nThe reason for petitioning these mountain and water tablets within the altar is that the fast’s sponsor or disciples, constrained by public or private affairs, may be unable to personally visit the grotto’s gate. Thus, they are proclaimed together within the altar. If the sponsor or disciples do not shrink from the distance of mountains and waters or the toil of ascent, and personally accompany the assembled officials to the grotto’s precincts, then on the night of merit’s proclamation, after the memorial is presented, only the earthen tablet is petitioned. The mountain and water tablets are set aside, to be addressed in their proper rites at the mountain and water sites—this is most fitting. Careful deliberation must guide action; one must not cling rigidly to the text.\n\nWhen casting the three tablets, it is most excellent to burn one or two hundred paper coins for the local earth deity.\n\n**Method for Casting the Five Thearchs’ Tablets on the Three Primes and Eight Nodal Days to Seek Pardon for Transgressions and Petition the True Ones**\n*From the* True Writ Jade Formulae\n\n**Supreme Petition Tablet for the Lingbao Tradition to Remove Transgressions and Seek Immortality at the Five Marchmounts and Sacred Mountains**\n\nLingbao so-and-so, Master of the Imperial Thearchs, your servant [Name], aged [X] years, born in the month of [X], fate governed by the Thearch of [X], name registered at [X] Marchmount. Aspiring to transcendence, aspiring to immortality, to attain long life and cross the world’s bounds, to soar and ascend to the Upper Clarity. O True Ones of the Five Marchmounts, most divine, most numinous: beseech that my transgressions be erased from the records, my name inscribed in the Nine Heavens. Petition to approach the sacred mountain, transmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier.\n\n[Reign title, era name, year, month, first day, day, hour] at this [location] the proclamation is made.\n\nThese three tablet texts each include the year, name, and governing Thearch. The aspiration for transcendence and immortality, and the following text, are as stated in the Water Mansion’s earthen tablet and the Yellow Register’s water tablet. The sealing incantation of the Dragon-Wall Clasp is as in the previous fast’s method.\n\nFor the first casting of the three tablets, each uses nine clasps. For the second and third castings, only the dragon tablet is used, without clasps.\n\nAfter casting is complete, scatter incense, pour forth water, and chant the hymn:\n\nThe Primal Beginning’s covenant shines,\nImmortals’ names are inscribed.\nThe Three Offices, Nine Bureaus—\nNo transgression remains unremoved.\nScatter incense to the Five Thearchs,\nProclaim the covenant to the Great Void.\nAs petitioned, may I dwell\nThrough ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThree bows.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Most High, Boundless Dao.\nWith utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures.\nWith utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.\n\nThe furnace is restored.\nO Fragrant Officer Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Attendant Fragrant Spirits: may the place where your servant casts the tablet spontaneously generate golden liquor, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred spirits and host of true ones gather here, before the grotto’s furnace. May your servant, in learning the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the fragrant smoke, swiftly conveying the words just proclaimed to the Most High, Boundless Dao, before the Sun Valley Divine King and the Nine Rivers’ Water Mansion and Water Thearch.\n\nEach: three bows.\n\nThe *Primary School of Immortals’ Hymns* is sung as usual.\n\nThe Dao speaks: You who with sincere heart set forth upon the supreme Dao, desiring to deliver all celestial beings, all good men and women, from the Three Evils, the Five Paths, and the Eight Difficulties—may they transcend the Three Evils, and in every life encounter the Dao. On the days of the Eight Nodes and the first of the month, cast the Three Primes’ jade tablets. Erase the records of past transgressions, inscribe names in Heaven. After three offerings, the Three Offices, Nine Bureaus, and all celestial realms will relay the petition to Heaven.\n\nTo the right, distinguish the myriad spirits, reverently guard the Five Thearchs. Attend and protect the Three Realms, oversee the gates and portals. Purify Heaven and Earth; gods, earth deities, sun, and moon come to pay homage. A thousand demons, ten thousand spirits dare not rashly intrude. With steadfast resolve, all endeavors are fulfilled. Seven generations of ancestors are liberated; from the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, they ascend to Heaven’s halls. Karmic retribution for good and evil in life and death is repaid in kind. The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus record merits and transgressions—this principle is most clear. Through countless lives, not a hair’s breadth is lacking.\n\nIf there are those of utmost dedication—emperors, kings, rulers of lands, officials, all people, nine generations of ancestors, those trapped in the Three Paths of darkness—who undertake the great Yellow Register fast for three days and nights, proclaim the covenant to the Nine Heavens, and cast the Three Primes’ tablets, the blessings and benefits are boundless, beyond words. You who earnestly uphold this, do not grow lax or idle, lest demons mar your body.\n\nMaster Daoist Zhang Chengguang says: Upon ascending the altar and receiving the Lingbao Central Covenant, in accordance with the *Spontaneous Golden Regulations*, cast ten golden clasps, release the dragon into the clear spring—this is the way to seek immortality. Ascend the altar again to receive the Five Elders’ Red Writ, the Two Registers, staff, and scepter, and stabilize resolve through contemplation of the subtle. Following the *Luminous True Regulations*, cast the Three Dragons’ twenty-seven clasps, with the mountain, water, and dwelling as pledges for the study of immortality. Then, with the jade formula, separately cast nine dragons’ twenty-seven clasps, and on the Eight Nodal Days cast the mountain, water, and dwelling tablets, forever erasing the records of transgressions and inscribing names in Heaven. Upon concluding the Yellow Register fast, cast the dragon tablet as well, following only the Three Primes’ tablet text, without additional proclamations or established oral formulae. The ignorant masses, passing this down, practice in confusion. In the past, I encountered my master, Lord Lu, who communed with spirits and entered the wondrous, whose words accorded with principle—none failed to evoke response.\n\nThe sublime resides in the heart, yet its writings lack ritual forms. If one merely copies and submits them according to the scriptural text, the mountain, water, and dwelling spirits will not be duly recorded—all actions, seen and unseen, will be reckless, greatly deviating from the Mysterious Tradition. Thus, I have composed these *Three-Part Petition Texts*, each addressed to its respective immortal bureau. Additionally, I have separately set forth *Three Tablet Ready-Made Formulae*. Now, if one follows these clearly in practice, one will surely receive the carving of one’s name in the registers and the erasure of transgressions, with one’s name recorded in the Nine Mysteries. This will elevate one’s family to prior glory, cause one’s studies to flourish, and secure immortality in life and death. I reveal this to my disciples, to be revered and kept secret.\n\nGuangting states: The Great Dao, through the One *qi*, generates and transforms the Three Powers, shaping the myriad existences. Thus, the Three Primes’ courts were established to govern transgressions and blessings—namely, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, who truly preside over the Three Primes. Human life and death, longevity and early demise, transgressions and goodness, fortune and misfortune—none are not bound to them. The *Three Register Tablet Texts* are likewise the canonical forms of the Three Primes. In the method of the fast, one should submit the three tablets to report to the Three Primes. Thus, the mountain tablet is submitted to the Heavenly Cavern of Prostration, petitioning the Celestial Official of the Upper Prime; the water tablet is submitted to the Numinous Spring Water Palace, reporting to the Water Official of the Lower Prime; and the earth tablet is submitted at the altar or dwelling, reporting to the Earth Official of the Middle Prime. Within the tablet texts, the titles and ranks of the true spirits are clearly set forth.\n\nIn recent times, only the mountain and water tablets have been submitted. However, in the regions beyond the Huai and Zhe rivers, the ritual of the three tablets has long been practiced. Now, upon examining the origins, I have found the texts recorded by Master Zhang Chengguang, which petition the Three Primes with great precision, leaving no doubt in the submission and offering of pledges. Thus, they may be followed as a permanent model. Not only in receiving the scriptures but also in submitting the three tablets and conducting the fast for deliverance, all depend on the Three Primes. If all three tablets are duly submitted, the tallying of meritorious deeds will reach the courts of the Three Officials. Those who cultivate and uphold this Way should not hesitate or doubt.\n\n*Concluding the Fifty-Fifth Scroll of the* Supreme Yellow Register Fast Ritual\n*Beginning the Fifty-Sixth Scroll of the* Supreme Yellow Register Fast Ritual\n\nRevised by Master Du Guangting of the Tang, *Ritual of the Lantern*\n\nThe method of the ritual lantern originates from the *Golden Register* scriptures. In all fasts and Dao-trails, burning incense and kindling lanterns are the most urgent tasks. Incense conveys the heart’s sincerity and ascends to move the perfected spirits. Lanterns dispel darkness and illuminate the hidden, opening the underworld’s eternal night. Thus, the scriptures decree: burning incense and kindling lanterns illumine the blessed halls of all heavens above and the long-night hells below. Suffering souls and stagnant spirits, riding this radiance, may at last attain liberation.\n\nSince lanterns must each follow their proper method, they are arrayed according to the fundamental numbers of the Five Phases: nine in spring, three in summer, seven in autumn, five in winter, and twelve in the four seasons. The positions of lanterns for all heavens, all earths, the Eight Trigrams, and the Nine Underworlds are arranged according to their directions in the complete register texts.\n\nWhen incense is burned and invocations are chanted, blessings swiftly descend and misfortunes naturally dissolve. Whether on the night of the fast’s commencement or during its three- or seven-day course, lanterns are kindled according to the method. At dusk, when the Dao-trail concludes, the altar is exited. At the earth-gate, with hymns and banners, in measured and elegant steps, the master leads the assembled officials and disciples in circumambulation beneath the lanterns, chanting invocations at each position. After each invocation, the officials and disciples bow. Upon completion, with a resonant, empty tone, they are guided back before the Mystic Master. The dispersal follows the usual ritual.\n\n*Hymn of the Illumined Lantern*\nThe Most High scatters light in the ten directions,\nFloral lanterns convey pure sincerity.\nAll heavens glow resplendent,\nAll earths shine with clarity.\nMy body, too, becomes luminous,\nThe five viscera blossoming in splendor.\nThe blazing radiance illumines the Great Void,\nFar-reaching thoughts reach the Jade Capital.\n\nThis hymn is chanted in a drawn-out voice in the eastern regions of Songshan, the Yellow River, and Tonghua. At dusk, ascending the altar, the master of invocations is led beneath the lanterns. When the lantern ritual begins, this hymn is chanted first, and the assembly circumambulates the lanterns once, then arranges ranks at the earth-gate to chant invocations, thus fulfilling the ritual.\n\nThe officials arrange their ranks at the earth-gate. The master speaks:\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate and Great Void declare: Yin and yang conjoin in form, heaven and earth divide in shape. Day and night differ, light and darkness diverge. Thus, the pure and ethereal manifest as the abodes of immortals and sages in all heavens, while the turbid and dense flow into the realms of ghosts and spirits in all earths. Above the Nine Heavens, yin qi is wholly dispelled; below the Nine Earths, yang radiance is forever barred. In these shadowed realms, no light remains. At midday, they are veiled in thick mist; at dusk, they sink deeper into gloom. The souls of the long night have no means to awaken. Some beings, devoid of good karma and burdened by past sins, have since their deaths sunk into hell, enduring myriad torments, imprisoned in Fengdu. Deprived of the Three Luminaries, they suffer for kalpas uncounted.\n\nOur Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, opens many gates of salvation. He bequeaths the scripture of kindling lanterns to continue the light and illumine the night. Where the numinous radiance reaches, sins and afflictions are all dispelled. Through the merit of repentance and deliverance, they may fulfill the vow of rebirth.\n\nIf there are good men and good women who arouse the mind for the supreme Dao, follow the regulations, and come to the fast, preparing incense and oil, they may kindle lanterns on behalf of the sovereign, the emperor, the ruler and ministers, fathers and sons, the Three Wretched Paths, and the Nine Nights—whether in darkness or light—illuminating within and without according to the method. Above, they reflect upon the heavens and the halls of blessings; below, they shine upon the Nine Earths and the depths of hell.\n\nMay the suffering souls be delivered, the benighted spirits illuminated. Shall the nine generations ascend to heaven? The Three Wretched Paths cease their accusations. Blessings extend to all, and merit knows no bounds. Know then that such a person, having accumulated good causes over kalpas, shall surely attain the Dao.\n\nNow, so-and-so official, so-and-so, has established the *Huanglu Lingbao* fast, following the ritual texts to kindle lanterns in offering. May it be that the emperor enjoys blessings, the Three Luminaries shine brightly, the seven generations ascend to heaven, and the Three Paths become radiant and serene. In this life, may divine spirits venerate and protect, true sages guard and sustain. May the fortune be majestic, and the immortal fruit be eternally attained.\n\nThe disciple bows twice.\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, at the Dao gate, kindle two lanterns to illuminate the residence of the fast’s sponsor. For the disciple, to dispel calamities and transcend misfortune, to pacify the residence and secure the spirits.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\nThe Dharma Master intones:\n*\"The light of the Orthodox Unity shines upward in crimson smoke.\nTwelve Light-Opening Lads,\nillumine all under heaven and our own bodies.\nA hundred evils are shattered, ten thousand ghosts repelled.\nThe radiance is bright and clear, communicating with the true and reaching the numinous.\nAscending into the formless, merging with the Dao’s spontaneity.\"*\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, at the position of one’s life destiny, kindle three lanterns to illuminate the three souls. For the disciple, to restrain evil and transcend adversity, to bind and guard the three souls.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\n*\"The yang light shines brilliantly, the three souls arise of themselves.\nAll spirits are recorded, ever attached to my form.\nLike the sun at its zenith, may I forever stand firm.\"*\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, at the position of one’s current age, kindle seven lanterns to illuminate the seven po. For the disciple, to pacify the spirits and avert misfortune, to restrain the po and expel evil.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\n*\"The bright lanterns gather light, the wandering essences do not flee.\nThe seven po are secure, all spirits return in full.\nLike the moon at its zenith, may I forever abide in radiance.\"*\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, at the position of the Grand Year, kindle one lantern to illuminate the year-star. For the disciple, to eliminate a year’s disasters and bring blessings and fortune.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\n*\"The Grand Yang flows its brilliance, its radiance filling the four directions.\nIlluminating my body, sevenfold and ninefold encircling.\nWithin, it shines; without, it brightens, penetrating the great void.\"*\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, at the great tomb, kindle three lanterns to illuminate the ancestral burial mounds of the fast’s sponsor. For the disciple, to deliver and transcend the departed souls of former generations, to be reborn in pure realms, to sever karmic entanglements, and resolve the disasters of retribution.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\n*\"Bowing toward the tomb positions of gong, yu, chen, shang, chou, jue, wei, zheng, and xu.*\n*The Grand Yin is dark, kalpas without end.\nThe yang light shines brilliantly, illuminating the decayed bones below.\nThe souls receive the light, refining their forms and returning to the womb.\nBorn in pure realms, they dwell in joy and harmony.\"*\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, at the lesser tomb, kindle five lanterns to illuminate the recent burial mounds of the fast’s sponsor. To deliver the divine spirits and enable rebirth in heaven, to benefit and protect the living, and to prosper blessings and fortune.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\n*\"Bowing toward the tomb positions of gong, yu, xu, jue, chou, shang, wei, and zheng.*\n*The long night is dark, kalpas without end.\nThe light hides in the Grand Yin, the seven po drift and flee.\nThe Crimson Numinous Lads, the Grand Yang shines brilliantly.\nIlluminating the souls and po, the divine spirits return as one.\"*\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, before the altar hall, kindle seven lanterns to illuminate the seven generations of ancestors. May the suffering souls and benighted spirits be reborn in heaven.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\n*\"Heaven turns, earth revolves, the ages shift in succession.\nThe Nine Darks are lightless, the seven generations unseen.\nThe Grand Yang opens the way, the dead souls respond and return.\nThe bright lanterns continue the night, the decayed bones shine anew.\"*\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, in the central courtyard, kindle the lanterns of the Nine Darks to illuminate the long-night abodes of the Nine Darks. To deliver the departed souls of the disciple’s ancestors within the Nine Darks, that they may behold the light.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\n*\"The Nine Darks are dark, kalpas without light.\nThe long night imprisons the souls, the Primordial Beginning unopened.\nThe flower lanterns continue the light, illuminating the Earthly Sovereign below.\nDelivering the seven generations, ascending to the heavenly palaces.\nIlluminating within and without, may they become immortal kings for all generations.\"*\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, at the side gates, kindle two lanterns to illuminate the palace and residence. For the disciple, to expel evil and capture malevolence, to protect the entire household.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\n*\"The yang light opens and brightens, crimson smoke blazes in splendor.\nThe Grand Flame Lads guard the mysterious gates.\nIlluminating the palace and residence, the four windows and eight openings are revealed.\nExpelling ghosts and capturing evil, ten thousand spirits are shattered.\nThe Three Realms venerate and protect, generation after generation unwaning.\nAll the perfected gather, sun and moon shine together.\"*\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, at the earthly gate, kindle twenty-four lanterns to illuminate the twenty-four vital breaths. For the disciple, to prolong life and augment qi, to increase blessings and pacify the spirits, to inscribe the name in the register of the living and erase it from the ledger of the dead.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\n*\"Bowing toward the earthly gate.*\n*The Three Divisions and Eight Luminaries compose my body.\nThe twenty-four breaths form my spirit.\nThe bright lanterns arise of themselves, ascending to the Great Mystery.\nMy body transcends water and fire, merging with qi’s spontaneity.\nThe Eight Luminaries align as one—may I attain divine transcendence.\"*\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, at the eight directions, kindle eight lanterns to illuminate the eight trigrams. For the disciple, to illuminate the eight reaches, open the nine palaces, secretly guard the eight spirits, and open the eight directions.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\n*Bowing toward the royal presence.*\nThe Three Luminaries shine brightly, the Eight Trigrams open their portals.\nHeavenly qi quietly seals, the Great Yin conceals its light.\nThe resplendent lanterns illuminate—may all vows be fulfilled.\nMy body enters radiance, to eternally partake of boundless blessings.\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, at the four cardinal directions and the center, kindle nine lanterns to illuminate the nine palaces. For the disciple, to transcend the nine palaces’ calamities and inscribe their name among the nine celestial palaces’ immortals.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\nThe Nine and Five stand divided, heaven and earth unfold.\nMysterious light lies hidden, the Great Yin does not brighten.\nMay my resplendent lanterns ascend to illuminate the nine palaces.\nThe dark night clears—may my vows prosper.\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, at the ten directions, kindle ten lanterns to illuminate the ten extremities. For the disciple, to illuminate the ten poles, summon the true and descend the numinous, dissolve calamities, and inscribe their name in the ten heavens.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\n*Bowing toward the celestial gate.*\nHeaven opens, earth seals; the mysterious Yin does not shine.\nCrimson smoke ascends, for me it pierces the unseen.\nThe honored deities of the ten directions, with their profound vision, behold my form.\nMy soul and spirit glow resplendently, naturally radiant in essence.\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, at the four directions, kindle twenty-eight lanterns to illuminate the twenty-eight constellations. For the disciple, to erase their name from the ledger of the dead and augment their inscription among the living. The Northern Dipper decrees death, the Southern Dipper extends life.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\n*Bowing toward the southeast.*\nThe bright star blazes brilliantly, its light flowing through the ten gates.\nMysterious essence descends, illuminating the Nine Dark Realms of the north.\nI kindle the resplendent lanterns, riding their light to ascend and be heard.\nMay I attain the azure canopy to illuminate my form and soul.\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, above the celestial gate, kindle thirty-six lanterns to illuminate the thirty-six heavens. For the disciple, to deliver their seven generations of ancestors and ascend them into paradise.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\n*Bowing toward the celestial gate.*\nThe Dragon Han era stretches boundlessly, the Three Qi ride the mysterious.\nThe Brahmanic path is distant, the Maitreya’s great chiliocosm vast.\nMy long soul gazes upward, yearning endlessly.\nToday’s bright lanterns—may my vow to attain immortality be fulfilled.\nWith my seven ancestors, may we together ascend the celestial realms.\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, at the five directions, kindle five lanterns to illuminate the five sacred peaks. For the disciple, to inscribe their name in the immortal register and safeguard their bodily form.\n\nThe disciple performs three bows beneath the lanterns.\nThe numinous mountains of the five peaks stand guard over the five directions.\nThe honored deities of the Five Emperors, the ancestral lineage of immortals.\nToday I kindle lanterns, ascending to illuminate the Heavenly Kings.\nMay my destiny be recorded, my passage into the immortal palaces assured.\nMay my seven ancestors be liberated, together ascending the Great Void.\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: The *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity* bear the weightiest merit. Above, they illuminate the heavens; below, they illuminate the earth. For eight directions and nine nights, all witness the radiance. Those who behold these lanterns shall have their sins extinguished and blessings arise. The one who kindles the lanterns shall receive profound fortune. Their nine generations of ancestors shall ascend to paradise, departing sorrow and suffering, forever escaping the Nine Dark Realms. They shall roam freely in the Upper Prime, within the immortal palaces. The living shall know peace, descendants shall flourish, households shall be purified, and myriad calamities shall not encroach. The living and the dead shall be delivered, and all shall bear the grace of life and death. The merit is boundless, and all aspirations shall be fulfilled. For family and nation, all shall enjoy prosperity and harmony. For nine nights and the Three Wretched Realms, all shall ascend the true Dao. Universally, we revere the Supreme Honored One.\n\nNext, recite the *Lesser Immortal Hymn of Praise*, lead to the presence of the Mysterious Master, and disperse according to the usual rites. Extinguish the lanterns at dawn.\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, the officials responsible for the lanterns must diligently attend to their duties. Ensure the lanterns’ light shines brightly throughout the night, without extinguishing midway. If they dim partially, the one responsible shall incur fault—this must be heeded with care.\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, extinguish the lanterns at dawn. The Dharma Master recites the incantation:\n*\"The mysterious Yin seals its light, the eternal lanterns continue to shine.*\n*The Great Yang has dawned, the Eight Dark Realms open and clear.*\n*The lanterns return to the Great Yin, their light merging with the radiant essence.*\n*The Two Perfected Ones of Sun and Moon unite with me.\"*\nUpon completing the incantation, extinguish the lanterns.\n\nWhenever conducting the *Yellow Register Fast*, one must follow the true texts and jade instructions. Apart from kindling lanterns in the four seasons, separately kindle the various lanterns of the *Golden Register* according to the rites, completing the bows and incantations. Whether performing the rites for three consecutive days or completing the bows and incantations in a single night, all shall receive blessings and benefits, and both the living and the dead shall partake of grace. Even without a fast altar, one may specially kindle these lanterns. Following the rites with bows and incantations, the merit shall be equivalent. Those who revere goodness should widely propagate this.\n\nAlternatively, within the fast, kindle the *Nine Dark Realms Lanterns* and perform the separate rites of bows and incantations. Even without a fast, one may specially kindle the *Nine Dark Realms Lanterns* for the living or the dead, also performing the separate rites of bows and incantations. The ritual procedures are appended below.\n\n**Rites and Incantations for the Nine Dark Realms Spirit Lanterns**\n\nThe *True Immortal Section of the Upper Prime Golden Register Ritual Texts* states: For the *Lantern-Kindling Rites of Dignity*, to eliminate celestial calamities for the emperor and rulers, rectify the celestial divisions, pacify the myriad people, and deliver the living and the dead, kindle the *Nine Dark Realms Spirit Lanterns*. Above, they illuminate the nine celestial halls of fortune; below, they illuminate the nine dark realms of hell. Both humans and heavens receive grace, and the living and the dead bear the favor.\n\nThe *Wondrous Scripture of the Nine Perfected Marvelous Precepts and the Golden Register for Deliverance* states: Across the eight directions of heaven and earth lie the nine dark realms of hell. The tormented and exiled sinful souls arise from the sins committed in life and death. After their bodies perish, they sink into the Three Wretched Realms, enduring retribution endlessly, with no means of liberation. In the eternal night, they never behold light. Were it not for the great sages’ compassion and the opening of karmic deliverance by good causes, they would dwell in darkness forever, their suffering unending through eons. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy established the statutes, composing the *Lantern-Kindling Rites*.\n\nFollowing the radiance of the western sun, its light illumines the depths of the Yellow Springs. Where its flowing brilliance reaches, the suffering of forsaken souls is stilled. Where its divine splendor shines, the anguish of the dark and forlorn ceases. The merit of kindling lanterns brings boundless blessings—whether to deliver the departed or to dispel calamity and remove misfortune.\n\nOne should prepare fragrant oil and journey to the sacred temples. With sincere devotion, bow in reverence, and with utmost piety, gaze upon the true numina. Burn incense, kindle lanterns, and offer rites with vows and worship. Through earnest sincerity and heartfelt devotion, the power of blessings extends. The departed ascend to heaven, and the living receive grace. The doctrine of karmic retribution fully encompasses the law of cause and effect. The *Golden Register*, *Nine Dark Realms*, and *Numinous Treasure* scriptures briefly expound its principles; here, we shall not elaborate further.\n\nAs for the *Nine Dark Realms Lanterns*, one must procure pure and fragrant oil, refraining from wealth obtained through unrighteous means or impure, defiled substances. Alternatively, infuse various incenses into the oil, so that the lamp’s flame burns with purity, diffusing its fragrance. Above, it moves the heavens; below, it purges foul impurities. The lantern’s light shines brightly, dispelling darkness and continuing illumination—thus accruing great merit.\n\nThe *Nine Dark Realms Lanterns* should be arranged before the sacred altar in the grand hall of the multitude of sages, divided into nine trees. Align them according to the nine directions, with nine lamps on each tree. Alternatively, each tree may have nine tiers, with nine lamps per tier. The number nine times nine accords with the pattern of heaven and earth. Below, it opens the nine nights; above, it reaches the nine mysteries. Delivering the living and rescuing the dead is the most sacred of blessings. For those of limited means, even nine lamps suffice—full preparation is not required. In this rite, one need only burn incense and invoke the true, offering sincere prayers in silent devotion. The merit thus communicated is of the same essence.\n\nAlternatively, one may prepare nine portions—or eighty-one—of water, congee, and seasonal fruits, arranging them before the nine directions, which is especially refined. Next, burn incense, meditate upon the deities, and strike the teeth twenty-four times. Then, make the invocation...\n\nThe officiant, your humble servant [Name], respectfully invokes the Local Domain True Officials, the Day-Directing Messengers, and the Void-Space Surveillance and Response Spirit Bureau.

Yet its merit extends further: averting calamities and summoning blessings, atoning for transgressions and seeking grace, its cultivation spans the realms of humans and heavens, its benefits embrace both households and nations—no merit remains unbestowed.\n\nThe *Five Elders’ Vermilion Writs of the Numinous Treasure*, which it enshrines, serve four distinct functions when invoked in detail:\n\nFirst, for seeking immortality and receiving the Dao: the twenty-four characters descending from the Nine Qi of the Eastern Direction.\nSecond, for warding off and restraining stellar influences: the thirty-two characters descending from Jupiter, the Liver-Assisting Star.\nThird, for subduing and vanquishing demonic forces: the thirty-two characters descending from the Incantation of the Eastern Mountain Spirit.\nFourth, for dispelling and mitigating water-borne disasters: the thirty-two characters descending from the Subjugation of the Eastern River below.\n\nThe applications of these five writs are herein complete.\n\nAs recorded in the ritual canons of Celestial Master Zhang Wanfu of the Pure Capital Abbey in the Western Capital: the esoteric languages of the heavens and the *Eightfold Jade Scripts of the Assemblies* were expounded by the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning in the Fragrant Grove Garden to the Youth of Supreme Wisdom. They deliver from the Five Sufferings and universally rescue the Nine Nether Realms. In the rites for the transference of spirits, they are engraved upon stone and put into practice.\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\nFor the present Yellow Register Fast and Altar rites, these texts are fitting for use. Whether in felicitous or inauspicious observances, their apportionment is just and proper. May they circulate for kalpas eternal.\n\nThe incantations are to be burned, the same as the true writs. There are established methods for this, to be jointly propagated.\n\nWritten on the fifth day of the tenth month, the *guiwei* day of the *xinyou* year of the Tianfu era (901), by Du Guangting, Feathered Robe of Tianmu Peak, in homage to the Sage.\n\nAll true writs are to be inscribed in cinnabar upon azure paper, together with the *Eight Hidden Characters of Heaven* and the *Jade Writs of the Central Heaven*, to guard the five directions of the fast altar. On the eve of the rite, the texts are read aloud; thereafter, a golden dragon is placed to secure them. Upon the dispersal of the altar, the texts are read aloud at night, whereupon the disciple holds them above the incense smoke. When the Dharma Master completes the incantation, they are burned in accordance with the memorial casket, precisely as prescribed in the *Rites of the Numinous Treasure True Writs*.\n\n**Eastern Jade Writ**\nDǎnlóu Āhuì, Wúxiǎng Guānyīn.\nXūyán Míngshǒu, Fǎlǎn Pútán.\nJiànà Āyì, Hūhē Liúyín.\nHuādū Qūlì, Xiānpú Yùzhēn.\nTáiluò Dàfàn, Sàn yān qìngyún.\nFēisǎ Yùdū, Míng mó shàng mén.\nWúxíng Shàngshǒu, Huízhí Liúxuán.\nĀtuó Lóngluó, Sìxiàng Xūfù.\n\n**Southern Jade Writ**\nNányán Dòngfú, Yùmóu Shēnshēn.\nFànxíng Luòkōng, Jiǔlíng Chuīqián.\nZéluò Pútái, Lǜluó Dàqiān.\nMiǎomǎng Jiǔchǒu, Sháo yáo yán zāo.\nYún shàng Jiǔdū, Fēishēng zì qiān.\nNàyù Yùfù, Móluó Fǎlún.\nWù chí wú jìng, Lǎnzī Yùnróng.\nFùlǎng Kuòyì, Shényīng zì gōng.\n\n**Western Jade Writ**\nDāolì Chányóu, Póní Jiùtōng.\nWǎnsǒu Dí sè, Tài miǎo zhī táng.\nLiúluó Fànméng, Jǐngwèi Xiāoyú.\nYì miǎo wú jì, Wǎnshǒu Shǎodū.\nĀyù Yùzhú, Huámò Yányóu.\nJiǔkāi Zìbiàn, Āluó Pǐnshǒu.\nWúliàng Fúgài, Fúluó Hé shén.\nYù dàn Chángsāng, □ kōng dù xiān.\n\n**Northern Jade Writ**\nJuéwú Zìyù, Jiǔrì Dǎoqián.\nKūnmǔ Dōngfù, Xíng shè shàng xuán.\nTuóluó Yùmiǎo, Miǎo qì hé yún.\nFēitiān Dàchǒu, Zǒngjiān Shàngtiān.\nShātuó Jiéliàng, Lónghàn Yīngxiān.\nBìluò Fúlí, Kōng gē bǎo zhēn.\nÈyì Wúpǐn, Dòngmiào Zìzhēn.\nYuánfàn Huīmò, Yōujì dù rén.\n\n**Central Jade Writ**\nHuángzhōng Zǒngqì, Tǒngshè Wúqióng.\nZhènxīng Tǔhuī, Liú liàn shéngōng.\n\nThereafter, the disciple holds the writ above the incense smoke.

These offenses have offended the True Numinous Ones, accumulated transgressions congealing in the Lower Origin’s palaces, the numinous springs and boundless seas, the various river sources, the Eight Marshes and Nine Jiang, and the records of the Water Officials. Congealed into calamities, they have entwined through generations. Through this repentance, we humbly beseech the thorough purgation of all offenses. May the imperial enterprise flourish, the sagely legacy extend forever. May the ten thousand regions be at peace, the eight seas undisturbed by waves. May Disciple So-and-so’s transgressions be absolved, disasters eradicated. May the living and the deceased receive protection, the household and state be graced with favor. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the realm of Non-Action, in harmony with the Dao, merging with the True.\n\nThe assembled ministers, on behalf of Official So-and-so and Disciple So-and-so, perform the fast and practice the Dao, sincerely revering and submitting to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Revered Scriptures, the sacred talismans and precious writs, the secret treasuries of the heavens, the true teachings of the ten directions, and all the numinous guardians of the scriptures. Today, we burn incense, reverently submit, and repent, for Disciple So-and-so’s offenses committed from past lives to the present, extending through kalpas. These offenses have violated the categories of the Three Origins, the true precepts and mysterious statutes. Disrespecting the revered scriptures, slandering the orthodox canons, every thought and intention has fallen into the net of transgressions. Entwined and congealed, they have never been repented. Names inscribed on the black tablets, bodies beset by calamities and peril—without relying on the mysterious power, there would be no means of absolution. Through this prayer and repentance, we humbly beseech the thorough purgation of all offenses. May the sagely reign flourish, the imperial virtue extend afar. May the ten thousand regions be bright and tranquil, the four seas at peace. May Disciple So-and-so’s calamities be cleared, the living and the deceased dwell in safety. May all sentient beings bathe in the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the realm of Non-Action, in harmony with the Dao, merging with the True.\n\n*Thus concludes the fifty-eighth fascicle of The Yellow Register Fasts of the Most High.*",

However, since a petition was already submitted at the fast’s initial establishment, daily repetition would be excessive in observance. Thus, it shall be done only once, and all subsequent petitions shall cease.\n\nThe assembled officials arrange their positions, banners, tablets, and incense altars, standing in solemn order before the Mystic Master. Once settled, the cantor intones:\n\n*\"All participants in the Daoist hall, each turn your minds to take refuge in the Three Treasures and all revered ones—\"*\n\nThe *Huaxia Hymn* is chanted, leading to the *Huaxia Hymn at the Earth Gate*. The *Scripture of the Jade Casket Revealing Perfection* is recited.

Immortal lads and jade maidens, heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, flying immortals, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the five Thearchs’ troops and horses, nine hundred million riders, overseers of the fast’s affairs, and the officials of the Three Realms array themselves to left and right.\n\nThen he envisions azure qi issuing from the master’s liver like clouds ascending. Within the azure qi are green dragons and lions. Heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, flying immortals, and the Five Thearchs of the five directions, with their troops and horses, envelop the bodies of the fast’s host and his household.

      "translated_text": "By gracious encounter with the supreme transformation, we have met true masters. They opened the gates of the Three Clarities’ myriad wonders and expounded the principles of the Eight Radiant Immortals’ longevity. They clarified the sea of desires and dredged the river of love to its depths. We gird ourselves with the Dragon Script and hold fast to the divine registers, propagating the Dao and extolling the Dharma, aiding the state and delivering people. In saving beings and establishing merit, purification and abstinence are the foundation.\n\nNow there is the official so-and-so, who, mindful of the state above and the unseen realms beside, seeks blessings and entreats grace, turning his heart toward the Ten Ultimates. He requests the performance of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Purification Rite. We have heard that the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures, the ranks of numinous immortals, the supreme wondrous Dharma, and the Yellow Register sacred altar communicate with the sagely and summon the perfected, modeling heaven and earth. They safeguard the state and family, so that lord and ministers receive the grace of protection; they deliver the living and the dead, so that all in life and death bear the power of preservation. When the Nine Dragons’ talismanic commands are opened, the hells become tranquil; when the Five Thearchs’ majestic spirits are summoned, the celestial charts shine bright and serene. Their merit surpasses all Dharmas, and their beneficence pervades all beings.\n\nThus, in accordance with the mysterious statutes, we present the ritual tokens: incense, flowers, oil, candles, brocade, and golden dragons, pledging faith to the ten directions and allying our hearts with the three realms. We, upholding the sagely teachings and humbly serving in the mysterious offices, are duty-bound to report all prayers and petitions. Today, we purify our minds and compose our thoughts, bathing in clarity and emptiness. We establish and perform the Yellow Register Grand Purification Rite, offering repentance and gratitude beneath the Three Luminaries for so many days and nights. We surrender our lives to the Utmost Perfected, to deliver so-and-so’s living and deceased kin, freeing them from suffering and ascending to bliss, reconciling grievances and dissolving karmic hindrances, dispelling calamities and dissolving disasters.\n\nWe reverently summon the celestial immortals’ armies of the Three Caverns, the flying immortals’ armies, the terrestrial immortals’ armies, the perfected ones’ armies, the divine beings’ armies, the sun, moon, and stellar constellations’ armies, the Nine Palaces and Five Thearchs’ armies, the Three Rivers and Four Seas’ armies—each numbering nine hundred million myriad riders. We summon the thirty-two overseers of the purification rite, the thirty-two golden lads attending incense, the thirty-two jade maidens scattering flowers, the Five Thearchs’ direct talismans, and the messengers who transmit words and memorials. We summon the thirty-two Flying Dragon Riders and the like. Together, they descend to oversee the purification site, secure the state’s fortune, protect all beings, and deliver the myriad generations of so-and-so’s ancestors. May the suffering souls of the unseen realms sever all evil karmic ties, enter the light, forever escape the three evil destinies, transcend the five sufferings, and surrender their lives to the boundless worlds of the ten directions, to the assemblies of great sages who have attained the Dao, and to the Utmost Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones. We beseech the dissolution of calamities and the removal of disasters, the prolongation of life and the preservation of destiny, passage through the three calamities and eight difficulties amid all evils, the protection of the state and the pacification of the family, and universal benefit to all sentient beings.\n\nOnce the Daoist rites are completed, those who have rendered meritorious service may report to the immortal palaces. The Merit Officials and Flying Dragon Riders shall separately memorialize and transmit these matters in due course. When the list of petitions is concluded, they shall return to our bodies and resume their places in the palaces. When summoned again, they shall arrive as before, in accordance with precedent.\n\nWe strike our teeth three times, swallow our saliva twice, and conclude the *Ritual of the Supreme Ultimate’s Purification Rite*.\n\nEach proclaims his Dharma rank, and all the officials secretly recite their own Dharma ranks:\n\nDisciple of the Three Luminaries of the Supreme Clarity’s Mysterious Capital and Great Cavern, Supreme Master of the Three Caverns, Master Practitioner of the Yellow Register Grand Purification Rite, Master of the Sacred Peak so-and-so, Perfected Lord of the Thearch so-and-so, your subject so-and-so, together in sincerity, reverently memorializes the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, the Utmost Limit Great Dao, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Jade Thearch on High, the assemblies of great sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions, the Utmost Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the thirty-two Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Clarity Supreme Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Watchtower, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity, Supreme Palace, Numinous Treasure, Utmost Perfected, Radiant August Dao Lord, the thirty-six divisions of venerable scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the officials and retinues of the three realms, and all true numina.\n\nWe, having accrued good causes over kalpas, were born into this great transformation. The mysterious and true awakened and delivered us, allowing us to dwell within the mysterious gate. Our three masters pledged and transmitted the Three Treasures’ true scriptures, with the Dharma duty to deliver ninety-nine thousand beings. Though we have ascended to the Utmost Perfected, our merit is slight and our virtue meager, and we have not yet attained immortality. Bearing transgressions and treading errors, we linger in the dusty world. Yet from the moment we received the Dharma, we pledged before the three realms to deliver beings and save creatures, making merit our priority. For all who take refuge, we are duty-bound to report.\n\nNow, in obedience to the edict, how dare we not make this known above?\n\nWe read the words:\n\nAs the petition states, the devotion is truly sincere. The purification master, having inherited blessings from past lives and risen in human rank, serves the state and family, aspiring to exalted fortune. Reflecting on his myriad generations of ancestors and the divine spirits of ten lifetimes—who, in their time in the world, accumulated transgressions and faults, wandering the long night of rebirth without means of deliverance—he desires to repay their boundless grace, which is as vast as the heavens.\n\nWe have heard that the Great Dao of Emptiness and Non-Being nurtures all beings. The Supreme Dharma King and the great sages of the heavens extend their compassionate grace, inaugurating the statutes of the Yellow Register. Repenting before the ten heavens and baring our hearts to the eight directions, our red sincerity turns toward them, and ten thousand sins are absolved. Reverently following the mysterious statutes, we present the golden dragon brocade as the token of our destined life, along with incense, flowers, oil, and candles, to manifest our faith and sincerity. We beseech the deliverance of the living and the dead, praying for mysterious protection.\n\nWe purify our spirits and compose our thoughts, cleansing our minds and darkening our hearts. In accordance with the Yellow Register’s simple texts and the numinous immortals’ statutes, we deliver the living and the deceased, establishing the sacred altar. The four quarters and eight directions model heaven and earth. We establish the purification rite and perform the Dao, burning incense and lighting lamps. We reveal the luminous texts of the Jade Treasury, breaking the suffering of the dark night’s underworld gates. We remove the net of sins and rescue those lost in the ford.\n\nToday, at this dawn of the purification rite, we first offer incense, making offerings to the Utmost Perfected and the supreme Dao Treasure. We surrender our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao. We prostrate ourselves, surrendering our lives to the Three Honored Ones on High. By this merit, we dedicate blessings to the purification master so-and-so’s myriad generations of ancestors and all divine spirits, liberating them from the three evil destinies and transcending the six paths of rebirth.",

Ever fearful that our allotted span may end, we shall face judgment in the dark night.

Above, they pray for the enduring fortune of the state; below, they extend their care to both the living and the departed. They seek to repay the nurturing grace of sovereign and kin, and to contemplate the sufferings of those trapped in the cycles of the dark night. Bearing their vows and pledges, they have established this sacred precinct, to atone for past faults and to invoke blessings for the future.

May the *Four Offices and Five Emperors*, the *Mighty Spirits of the Three Realms*, descend with their transformative power, dispelling the mists and clouds to bring blessings; may they manifest their luminous might, attending our prayers and repentance in unison.\n\nMay the gates of the netherworld’s long night be opened, and the sufferings of the imprisoned souls in the dark prisons be released. May they depart the shadowy realms, ascend the celestial thoroughfares, awaken to the Dharma, hear the scriptures, and through contemplation of the *Mysterious*, realize the Dao.\n\nMay the patron’s household—nine generations of kin, both departed and living—see their three karmic offenses dissolved and their six sensory obstructions extinguished. May the celestial nets and earthly snares not bring calamity to their three destinies; may the dark stars and bright constellations forever still the misfortunes of the five phases. May the divine and true protect them, increasing their fortune and longevity.\n\nAbove, may the state’s prosperity know no bounds, and the imperial reign endure forever. May the sacred person of the sovereign enjoy boundless longevity, towering like the mountains; may their sagely grace flow abundantly, vast as the deep seas. May all regions submit in harmony, and the eight directions shine with clarity. May the three luminaries follow their courses in the primordial heavens, and the hundred grains flourish throughout the land. May borders know no war, and customs resound with songs of praise. May the world attain great peace, and all beings fulfill their natures. May this extend to all, whether hidden or manifest, sinking or submerged, that together they may ascend the steps of the true and reach the shore of blessings.\n\nMay the *Heavenly Worthy’s* choice to broadly deliver accord with our humble submission, and may our sincerity in devotion be met below. We respectfully make this known.\n\nWe now invoke:\nFirst, the harmonious union of heaven and earth;\nSecond, the steadfast brightness of sun and moon;\nThird, the orderly succession of yin and yang;\nFourth, the peace of the realm;\nFifth, the flourishing fortune of the emperor;\nSixth, the loyalty and integrity of ministers;\nSeventh, the well-being of the myriad people;\nEighth, the abundance of the hundred grains;\nNinth, the liberation of the suffering in the dark paths;\nTenth, the flourishing of the Great Dao.\n\nWe replenish the incense burner.\nO *Incense Official Messengers*, *Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger*, and all *Spirit Officials* attendant upon the incense, may this place where we perform the Dao naturally generate golden elixir, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms.

Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, and all true numina of the ten directions, three realms, famous mountains, and grotto-heavens.\n\nWe have heard that the Great Dao precedes heaven,\nUtterly real, vast and distant.\nIt is the origin of creation, the potter of yin and yang.\nWhen it condenses spirit, it is profound stillness and emptiness;\nWhen it applies its function, it encompasses the vast and great.\nThe Three Officials and Five Emperors, the Nine Bureaus and Four Offices,\nUphold the mysterious transformation to give life and completion,\nReceiving the divine statutes to examine and tally.\nFortune and misfortune, sin and blessing—\nNot even the tiniest is overlooked.\n\nThe patron of this retreat, so-and-so,\nFrom the first condensation of qi

and death, they err and stray.\nThe bitter roots of past-life adversaries\nHave yet to be dissolved and swept away.\n\nNow, in accordance with the *Scripture on Karmic Retribution and Liberation Spoken by the Flying Heavenly Divine Persons* and the *Text on Salvation and Deliverance*,\nWe prepare golden dragon-patterned silks, incense, flowers, and ritual offerings,\nPurify our minds and refine our conduct,\nEstablishing this sacred precinct.\nWe repent before the Mysterious Perfected,\nRedeeming and ransoming our sins and faults.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Heavenly Worthy, in

from the abode of the long night,\nFreeing them from the midst of the Nine Dark Springs.\nAdorned in the celestial regalia,\nTheir names erased from the ghostly registers,\nThey will ascend beyond the nether realms,\nBathe in the numinous streams,\nAnd attain the carefree realms of the heavenly halls.\nTheir baleful destinies severed,\nFortune and benefit will manifest.\nThe patron’s family, both inner and outer kin,\nWill together partake in this radiant protection.\nDisasters and misfortunes will cease,\nAuspicious omens will ever arrive.\nThe Great Dao will descend with its numinous power,\nThe heavens will bestow their aid.\nNo demonic forces will arise,\nNo evils will assail.\nThe nation’s destiny will extend and flourish,\nThe imperial enterprise will broaden and expand.\nThe

delight in well-being.\nThe harvests will be bountiful,\nThe realm will know no strife.\nThe flying and sinking will follow their nature,\nThe dark night will be illuminated.\nExtending to the ten directions,\nPervading the three realms,\nAll under heaven will be wholly saved,\nAll will receive grace.\n\nMay the blessings of the Heavenly Worthy and Great Sages above be made manifest,\nAnd may the sincerity of our refuge below be answered.\nWe reverently proclaim this to be heard.\n\n**Generating the Aspirations**\nFirst aspiration: For the sake of the Dao’s Four Great Elements, in harmony with the virtue of the retreat’s patron.\nMay the seven generations of parents be spared from falling into sorrow and suffering,\nAscend to the heavenly halls,\nAnd receive clothing and food naturally.\n\nSecond aspiration: For the emperor and lord of the nation, may the Dao’s transformation flourish and prosper.\nMay the schools and academies thrive,\nThe imperial teachings expand and flourish.\nMay their majesty and dignity be revered,\nUniversally admired by all under heaven.\nMay the people praise the Great Peace,\nThe four barbarians submit in awe.\nMay evil and malevolence self-destruct,\nSages and worthies be born daily.\n\nThird aspiration: For the Dharma Master, may great merit and virtue be established.\nMay their teachings be clear and far-reaching,\nAll attaining the flight of immortals.\n\nFourth aspiration: For fellow practitioners of the same aspiration.\nMay they swiftly attain the immortal Dao,\nMutually aiding and delivering one another.\n\nFifth aspiration: For the ninefold kin to live in harmony,\nEsteeming benevolence and righteousness,\nHonoring the Dao and despising wealth,\nTheir conduct a model for all beings.\n\nSixth aspiration: For those who diminish themselves to bestow alms upon Daoists and the hungry and cold.\nMay all people under heaven\nEach find their rightful place.\n\nSeventh aspiration: For the wriggling and

merit,\nEstablishing virtue to compensate for faults.\n\nNinth aspiration: For the prosperity of family and nation.\nMay the ancestral temples have heirs,\nGenerations give rise to worthy talent.\n\nTenth aspiration: For reverently receiving the scriptures and teachers,\nNever daring to slacken in equanimity.\nWith one mind, broadly delivering all,\nMay they attain the rank of upper

May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the fragrant smoke, transmitting and presenting my supplications, swiftly reaching the presence of the Most High, the Limitless, the Great Dao, the Three Clarities, the Supreme Saints, and the Jade Emperor.\n\n*Exiting the Chamber*\n*End of the Fourth Scroll of the* **Highest Clarity Yellow Register Retreat Rites**\n*Fifth Scroll of the* **Highest Clarity Yellow Register Retreat Rites**\n*Compiled by Master Du Guangting of Tang Guangcheng*\n\n**Second Day: Midday Procession of the Dao**\n*Entering the Chamber*\nEach pays homage to the master, visualizing as prescribed.\n\nThe Yellow Center guards with qi, severing the roots of demonic clans.\nSuppressing the sources of evil,\nCutting off the traces of demons.\nBy the talismanic command of the Most High,\nDivine power is summoned and controlled.\nThe myriad spirits are thus subdued,\nRepelling misfortune and eliminating calamity.\nThe three wheels of royal qi,\nCirculate the true wind.\nThe purple portal cradles jade,\nBestowing boundless deliverance.\nTo the left, the Azure Waist is commanded;\nTo the right, the Mushroom Youth is summoned.\nRiding the whirlwind and soaring light,\nMastering the nine voids.\nThe Mysterious Altar responds to the moment,\nMounting the qi in emptiness.\nThe ten thousand perfected descend in unison,\nDelivering boundless salvation.\n\n*Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times*\n\nO Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin of the Three Qi, Most High Lord Lao: summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Left and Right Fragrant Bearers, the Dragon-Riding Couriers, the Golden Youths attending incense, the Jade Maidens transmitting words, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, the Direct-Day Fragrant Officials—thirty-six each. Summon forth the local earth gods and territorial deities, the true officials and orthodox spirits, to swiftly emerge, prepare their attire, and open the gates. As we now burn incense, we dedicate it to so-and-so official, so-and-so person, for the state and for the family, in the performance of the Most High Yellow Register Great Retreat for so many days and nights. Today, on the second day at midday, we ascend the altar, pay homage to the perfected, and practice the Dao. May we receive the life-generating qi of the Most High and the ten directions’ true perfected ones, flowing into our bodies, so that our supplications swiftly reach the presence of the Most High, the Limitless, the Great Dao, the Jade Emperor.\n\nEach declares their dharma rank:\n\nWe, disciples of the Mysterious Capital, humbly and with one heart, reverently supplicate the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Non-Being and Spontaneous Origin, the Limitless Great Dao, the Most High Great Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Jade Emperor, the ten directions’ great saintly perfected ones who have attained the Dao, the myriad true lords and venerable masters, the thirty-six Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Void Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, the Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Watchtower, Seven-Jewel Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity Supreme Palace, the Numinous Treasure Perfected Sovereign of Luminous Augustness, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the King of Total Perfection of the Western Culmination, the Eastern Minister of Destiny, the Supreme Primordial Perfected One, the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace Lower Teaching, the numinous palaces of the Five Marchmounts, the perfected immortals of the renowned mountains and grotto-heavens, the responsive and perceptive spirits of the Three Realms, and all true numina.\n\nWe, by fortunate coincidence, meet this blessed occasion, our good karma accumulated from past encounters. The Three Honored Ones spread the transformation of non-action; the Four Luminaries open the gate of broad salvation. Thus, with mortal forms, we rely on the wondrous dharma of our lineage. We unfold the precious writs of the ninefold radiance, gaze upon the jade chapters of the Three Caverns. Though inwardly we measure our meager capacities, surely we are unworthy. Only through the fast and precepts do we hope to establish modest merit, aiding the state and delivering people, fulfilling the mysterious intent. In all our endeavors, how dare we not report them above?\n\n*Reading the Petition*\nFollowing the words of the petition, we sincerely submit to the Mysterious Culmination. For the state and for the family, we request blessings and pray for grace.\n\nDisciple so-and-so reflects: my nature is endowed with the three numina, my spirit molded by the four greats. In the River of Love, my nature is drowned; in the Sea of Desire, my sincerity races. Illusory realms are easily confused; the mountain of blessings is hard to construct. Faults and transgressions accumulate, deepening with the years. I have heard that the wondrous retreat of the Yellow Register is a secret rite of the Mysterious Capital. Above, it delivers billions of ancestors, severing the roots of evil karma and sinful retribution; below, it rescues the nine nights and three paths, the destitute souls and hidden spirits. It dissolves calamitous knots, opens deliverance for heaven and humanity. Wherever its blessings extend, families and states enjoy eternal peace. Thus, with solemn reverence and earnest sincerity, I prepare fragrant flowers, offerings, patterned silks, golden dragons, lamps, and candles, establishing the retreat and practicing the Dao, praying for the descent of the perfected. Universally for the living and the dead, I turn my heart and plead for destiny.\n\nToday, at midday, practicing the Dao, we, the assembled dharma practitioners, offer this first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering to the Most High and True Dao Treasure. We dedicate our bodies, lives, and destinies, prostrating ourselves, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Most High. May this merit, above, benefit the sacred spirits of the altars of soil and grain and the ancestral temples. May they merge with the three realms, ascend the nine heavens, secretly assist the great foundation, and safeguard the great enterprise. May the emperor’s longevity equal the sun and moon, his transformation harmonize the three origins. May his chariots and standards reach the eight extremities, his dominion embrace the ten thousand states. May the heir apparent, the regional lords, and the imperial aides assist the imperial plan. May the worthy ministers and meritorious officials protect and govern the royal house. May auspicious clouds spread their radiance, and the dharma rain nourish all. May the four companions and three masters, the mountain-dwelling fellow practitioners, together attain the fruit of perfection, all ascend the immortal ranks.\n\nThus, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great saintly host of the perfected and true. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, in harmony and union with the Dao in truth.\n\nToday, at midday, practicing the Dao, we offer this second pinch of incense. We dedicate our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao, prostrating ourselves, taking refuge in the Most High Revered Scriptures. May this merit bless the nine generations of ancestors in the hidden chambers and the seven lineages of spiritual consciousness. May the vast radiance shine downward, leading them from the dark springs’ gates; may the mysterious grace spread widely, releasing them from the net of scorching toil. May the Three Officials erase their records, and the Five Paths generate their spirits. May they hear the true dharma in the Purple Tenuity, pay homage to the perfected in the Azure Vault. May they wear the talismans of the numinous writs, transcend the cold courts of the night prisons. May the six destinies and three paths together reach the realm of blessings.\n\nThus, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great saintly host of the perfected and true. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless.",

The Azure Scriptures spread afar, rescuing the four deluded from the six destinies; the Vermilion Writings broadly expounded, bestowing abundant blessings upon the Nine Dark Realms. The living and the dead alike receive grace, the benighted and the enlightened together know peace.\n\nWe, above, consider the nine mystic generations and seven ancestral lines, the karmic bonds of kalpas past, extending to lord and kin, and reaching to family and state. Reflecting upon the radiant favor, we grandly open the vast interior. We take refuge at the Mysterious Altar, offering sincerity to the Purple Palace.

Incense, flowers, lamps, and candles attest to our faith and convey our sincerity. Dragon jades and patterned silks express the heart and display our rites. With concentrated thought and focused visualization, we hope to attain resonance and communion.\n\nWe pray that the Supreme Dharma King will shine forth his compassionate light to illumine below; that the Great Sage of the Mysterious Capital will extend his beneficent influence to descend afar. May he command the flying heavenly spirit-kings to proclaim the covenant to the Three Realms; may he open the palaces of the Cold Court to release the hidden souls. May the numinous essences of generations past all receive deliverance and elevation. Bathed in the divine fluid, may they ascend beyond the Southern Palace. Hearing the Dharma-sound, may they transform and be born in the immortal realms.\n\nAbove, we pray for the eternal life of the sagely lord, for the imperial enterprise to know no bounds.

May the tracks of chariots be wholly unified, the celestial motions all harmonious. May the Eight Winds blow gently, the Five Grains ripen abundantly. May weapons of war not be raised, beacon fires forever stilled. May the people know no disease, and customs abound in auspicious signs. May our family, kin, and clan all partake of vast fortune. May the Three Paths and Nine Nights, the moving and the still, the floating and the hidden, all receive the compassion of the wondrous Dao, and together attain the fruits of spontaneity.\n\nAbove, may the Heavenly Worthies manifest their great compassion; below, may our sincere prayers be answered. We humbly present this petition for your hearing.\n\nWe make our vows:\n\nFirst vow: May the Great Dao be serene and empty, tranquil and still, abiding in clarity. May it broadly open the Dharma-gates to instruct the stubborn. May all receive its beneficent influence and cultivate with diligent austerity. May we, with our fellow students, universally ascend to the void, preserving ourselves with Heaven, and abiding forever without care.\n\nSecond vow: May the various heavens congeal qi and become clear. May the high void broadly cover, preserving the true and securing the numinous. May the climate be harmonious, the four seasons balanced.

May Heaven be preserved for long ages, enduring for kalpas without end.\n\nThird vow: May the earth cover and support without limit. May it be stable and not sink, the seas not collapse. May it protect and secure family and state, the myriad people flourishing in accord. May it nourish the living and pacify the dead, its beneficence pervading the ten directions. May crops and plants flourish, daily increasing in abundance. May all receive its generous support, the myriad kinds all following.\n\nFourth vow: May the sun and moon, the two luminaries, be lofty and bright. May they know no dimming or eclipse, their waxing and waning peaceful and clear. May their light illumine the various heavens, penetrating and dispelling the dark and obscure. May they secure the kalpic destiny, the world’s reign peaceful. May they universally bestow moistening grace, showering blessings upon all beings.\n\nFifth vow: May the stars and constellations shine with the same brilliance as the sun. May their revolving torches illumine, brightly reflecting the ten directions. May each abide in its proper place, their paths straight and true. May they protect and secure family and state, sparing them from calamity and harm. May the Four Seas be tranquil and unified, the world universally flourishing.\n\nSixth vow: May the four seasons follow their nodes in succession. May the seasonal qi be harmonious and balanced, without calamity or affliction. May pestilence and poison be extinguished, the world universally at peace. May the Five Grains ripen abundantly, the state prosperous and the people joyful.\n\nSeventh vow: May floating clouds congeal qi and gather mist. May they soar high and become clear, shading the mysterious and profound. When hidden, they are without action; when dispersed, they fill the heavens. May immortals and transcendents dwell together, forming friendships with the host of perfected. May beneficence flow to all, loving the state and cherishing the people. May all beings be universally saved, humanity enduring kalpas together.\n\nEighth vow: May wind and rain flow and shower without limit. May they universally bestow and release, receiving their flourishing. May the myriad things flourish, the state’s stores and the people’s abundance increase.\n\nNinth vow: May the Five Marchmounts each abide in their proper place. May they tower majestically, containing and concealing, forever serving as immortal palaces. May they secure the state’s destiny, preserving Heaven without end. May they protect and deliver all, none not looking up in reverence.\n\nTenth vow: May the rivers and seas be vast and boundless. May they contain and embrace, expansive and broad, nurturing even the smallest. May their depths be profound and their kindness gentle, moistening all that wriggles and breathes. May Heaven and humanity protect and bless, their years enduring like kalpic stone.\n\nEleventh vow: May the emperor’s state daily flourish. May the Four Quarters be peaceful and harmonious, weapons of war not raised. May Heaven and humanity sing in praise, auspicious responses arriving in flight. May teachings be widely disseminated, majestic transformations overflowing. May the myriad people rejoice, eternal joy without end.\n\nTwelfth vow: May the crawling and flying, the moving and stirring, those already born and those yet to be born, all receive safety and universally attain life. May all see the primordial qi and receive the forms of yang. May grasses and trees, fruits and forests endure winter without withering. May all be delivered and saved, none not flourishing and radiant.\n\nHarmonizing with the Dao, uniting in perfected truth.\n\nThe incense is offered again.",

      "translated_text": "The Twenty-Four Rolls of the Dharma Drum Resound\n\nFrom the Supreme Three Heavens, the Primordial Origin of the Three Qi, the Most High Lord Lao, summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attending Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon-Riding Scribes, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Thirty-Six Officers of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense—each in their thirty-sixfold ranks. Summon now the local earth deities and domain guardians, the true officials and correct spirits, to swiftly emerge and open the passes.\n\nWe now burn incense in proper ritual, dedicating this to so-and-so official, so-and-so person, for state and family, as we undertake the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast for so many days and nights. On this second day, at twilight, we ascend the altar, burn incense, and perform the Dao-procession. May the life-generating qi of the Most High’s Ten Directions and Correct Perfected Ones descend and flow into our bodies, that our supplications swiftly reach the presence of the Jade Thearch, the August Emperor of the Supreme Dao of the Utmost Real and Infinite.\n\nEach proclaims their dharma-rank:\n\nDisciples of the Supreme Clarity and Mystic Capital, we, so-and-so, humbly and with one mind, reverently address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous Origin, the Infinite Dao, the Most High Great Dao Lord, the Great Sagely Ancestor, the Highest Great Dao, the Golden Watchtower, the Mysterious Origin, the Heavenly Thearch of the August Emperor, the Most High Lord Lao, the Supreme Mysterious Elder, the Great Sages of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Void Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, the Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous, the Northern Perfected, the Mystic Capital, the Golden Watchtower, the Seven-Treasure Mystic Terrace, the Purple Tenuity, the Supreme Palace, the Numinous Treasure, the Perfected and Radiant August Dao Lord, the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Center, the Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, the Director of Destinies Perfected Lord, the King of Total Perfection of the Western Culmen, the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lower Teaching, the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Departments, the True Officials of the Five Marchmounts, the Grottoes and Caverns of the Numinous Mountains, the responsive and perceptive deities of the Three Realms, and all the mysterious bureaus.\n\nWe have long been endowed with the true vehicle and born in an age of Dao-transformations. The Vermilion Writs govern fate; the Mysterious Teaching spreads widely. We have presumptuously received the grace of masters and transmitted the secret registers. Yet we have not been able to lodge our spirits in the famous peaks, fix our thoughts on the Central Void, or befriend the Supreme Perfected. Thus, while we vow to deliver the departed according to the mysterious statutes, our first duty is to aid the state, expound the Dharma to save people, and establish merit as our foundation. In all our petitions, how dare we not make this known above?\n\nRecitation of the Words\n\nFollowing the recited words, we truly and earnestly pray. May this benefit the state and family, universally extending to the living and the dead. We reverently invoke the imperial altar, looking up to implore the mysterious blessings.\n\nWe, in accordance with the Purple Yang Jade Writs and the Yellow Register’s precious texts, the karmic conditions of sin and fortune, and the deliverance statutes, present silk as ritual sincerity, dragon jades, incense, and flowers, offering our sincere hearts as we perform the fast and vigil. We prostrate ourselves, hoping the Great Sages of the Ten Directions and the Most High’s host of venerables will condescend to descend their majestic radiance and graciously turn their wise gaze. May they broadly bestow blessings and favor, fulfilling our heartfelt sincerity.\n\nOn this twilight procession of the Dao, we request the Dharma assembly to offer the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to rely on the Three Venerables of the Most High. May these merits be dedicated to the ancestral temples and the august spirits of the altars of soil and grain, ascending to the Great Clarity, roaming the Purple Watchtower. May the emperor’s august brilliance, together with the encompassing of heaven and earth, equally honor transformations, pervade the boundless, and extend benevolence to all without exception. May the empress, inner officials, and the six palaces be suffused with goodness. May the crown prince and the various princes have blessings extending for ten thousand generations. May the myriad officials, ministers, the Four Companions, and the Three Masters all enter non-action and fully attain the fruits of the Real.\n\nThus we burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely host of masters and the virtues of the Perfected. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nOn this twilight procession of the Dao, we request the Dharma assembly to offer the second pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.\n\nWe devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to rely on the Most High’s Venerable Scriptures. May these merits bring blessings to such-and-such a family, the ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears, the departed spirits. May the transgressions of kalpas be washed away, receiving the registers of the Three Caverns; may the karmic retributions of accumulated lives be dissolved, escaping the ninefold darknesses of suffering. May their essences be refined in the Southern Palace, their spirits ascend to the upper realms.\n\nThus we burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely host of masters and the virtues of the Perfected. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nOn this twilight procession of the Dao, we request the Dharma assembly to offer the third pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters.\n\nWe devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to rely on the Three Venerables of the Most High. May these merits bring blessings to such-and-such a family, the six relations and five clans, the inner and outer kin. May good fortune be ever renewed, and calamities and misfortunes naturally cease. May the Valley Spirit embrace the wondrous, and the Supreme Dao bestow its grace. In all actions and thoughts, may they all receive primordial auspiciousness. Then may the three paths and six destinies, all sentient beings, have the waves of the sea of suffering stilled and the flames of the furnace of craving quelled. May the true wind spread widely, and the rain of kindness universally moisten. May all fully realize the stages of the Dao and attain the fruits of the Real.\n\nThus we burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely host of masters and the virtues of the Perfected. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nSalutation to the Directions\n\nRepentance",

In this propitious season, we purify ourselves with solemn fast and devotion, our minds fixed upon the Three Realms, our thoughts cleansed in the profound mystery. We burn incense, kindle lamps, recite scriptures, and circumambulate the Dao, hoping that through our earnest devotion, our prayers may ascend to the august numina.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves, beseeching the Three Supreme Venerables and the Great Saints of the Ten Directions to cast their merciful gaze upon us and perceive the sincerity of our hearts. May they bestow great blessings upon the ancestral temple and secure the grand designs of the state. May the realm enjoy peace, and the sacred person of the Emperor be eternally blessed.

May the people proclaim great peace, the four barbarians submit in reverence. May evil and malevolence vanish of themselves, and sages and worthies arise daily.\n\nThird invocation: For the Dharma Masters, may their merit and virtue be greatly established, their teachings and transformations be luminous and far-reaching. May they all attain the flight of immortals.\n\nFourth invocation: For fellow aspirants in study, may they swiftly attain the immortal Dao and mutually enlighten one another.\n\nFifth invocation: For the harmony of the nine relations, may they esteem benevolence and righteousness, value the Dao and disdain wealth, their conduct serving as a model for all.\n\nSixth invocation: For selflessness, may they bestow alms upon Daoist priests and those who suffer hunger and cold.

As they emerge, they array themselves in solemn attire and open the gates of the Mysterious Altar to the Heavenly Thearch and Divine Lord. They shall summon the local earth gods and territorial true officials.\n\nToday, in reverent offering for the intent of supplication and grace at the Jade Palace, we present our cinnabar script. May the numinous radiance of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure descend and flow into our bodies. Thus shall the purple essence surge and flourish, the Jade Palace shine resplendent. The Five Elders shall nurture the root, the Ten Thousand Thearchs gather the true. Our forms shall mirror the luminous pearl, riding the light and harnessing the imperial chariot. Golden radiance blazes forth, guiding the qi to ascend to the Upper Clarity.

Thus do the Mysterious and Yellow unfold in order, their light and brilliance manifest and proclaimed. The sun’s palace and moon’s city stand high above the Nine Clarities; the utmost true and primordial sages dwell steadfast within the Eight Luminaries. They nurture the vast and benefit the heavens and humans, spreading divine merit to guard the states and kingdoms. Therefore, the five sacred and profound chapters reward the Five Thearchs and expand the Five Directions; the Three Caverns, vast and deep, emerge from the Three Clarities to bless the Three Realms. Lofty beyond measure, revered through kalpas uncounted.\n\nWe have long revered the mysterious scriptures and early partaken of the true and wondrous.

May the Purple Palace gather our spirits, bestowing protection upon the imperial domain. May it transcend the Six Directions in non-action, surpassing the eras of Fu Xi and Shen Nong to perpetuate the imperial blessings.\n\nNow, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the great sagely hosts, the virtues of the utmost true, who after attaining the Dao ascend into the formless.

At the dawn of radiant enlightenment, upon the vast expanse of supreme nothingness, the divine winds gathered in subtlety, and the true Dao fused with essence. There emerged the chapters of *Eternal Life and Salvation of the World*, containing the essentials of soaring ascent and transcendence. The Dharma’s resonance first resounded, transmitted through forty thousand kalpas; the Crimson Palace repeatedly proclaimed it, revered by five hundred million heavens. Thus, the Nine August Masters received it, practicing and venerating it through the ages, aiding the state and pacifying the realm, bestowing auspicious blessings and conferring fortune.\n\nWe, aspiring to truth and holding the Dao in reverence, unfold the primordial. We pray for boundless blessings, awaiting the communion of sincere devotion. On this propitious day of stellar brilliance, we follow the rites of supplication to invoke felicity. Lighting lamps and burning incense, we recite the scriptures and circumambulate the Dao. With minds fixed upon the Ten Poles, we send forth our earnest pleas to the heavens. We beseech the myriad sages to incline their radiance, and the hosts of venerables to extend their grace. May their discerning gaze bestow favor, and the Purple Palace grant blessings.\n\nMay the imperial dynasty’s altars flourish and endure, the ancestral temples stand secure. May the grand foundation be firmly established, enduring through eternal kalpas. May the Emperor’s longevity surpass Penglai, his fortune equal the boundless heavens. May his reign mirror the calendars of Yao and Shun, endless as the sun and moon; may his domain encompass the traces of Yu and the enclosures of Zhou, bringing harmony to Hua and Yi alike. May the imperial consorts and princes assist in upholding the imperial way. May all within the four seas and under heaven receive and propagate his sagely grace. May distant courts submit in reverence, and remote lands become tributary guests. May the years yield abundant harvests, and the people attain peace and joy.\n\nMay the imperial heir apparent be cultured, gentle, and kind, radiating benevolence and harmony. May his loyalty and filial piety shine in the southern quarter, his virtue admired by all; may his humility and reverence flourish in the eastern realm, his noble example inspiring the nine domains. May he forever assist in the sagely enterprise, ensuring the prosperity of the great treasure. Extending to all, whether manifest or hidden, high or low, may all ascend to the garden of benevolence and longevity, and together partake in the era of harmony and prosperity.\n\nAbove, may the radiant Celestial Worthy’s boundless grace be manifest; below, may it fulfill our humble servants’ sincerity in taking refuge.\n\nRespectfully invoked.\n\nVows:\nFirst vow: May the Great Dao flow freely, and all under heaven embrace virtue.\nSecond vow: May all sentient beings awaken to the Dao.\nThird vow: May the sorrowful souls of the nine nights attain liberation at once.\nFourth vow: May the forsaken spirits without refuge all receive rebirth.\nFifth vow: May the world know peace, and the five grains ripen in abundance.\nSixth vow: May ministers be loyal and children filial, rulers benevolent and fathers kind.\nSeventh vow: May the four seas be united, and enmities resolved in harmony.\nEighth vow: May those in wombs and eggs all be born and thrive.\nNinth vow: May chronic and recent illnesses swiftly be healed.\nTenth vow: May the destitute and orphaned be clothed and fed.\n\nReplenishing the incense burner:\nIncense Official Messengers, Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all attendant spirit officials—may this place where we present our petition naturally generate golden elixir, cinnabar, and jade mushrooms. May the hosts of a hundred spirits and immortals gather here before the mystic altar. May our bodies radiate golden splendor, severing the roots of the womb’s bonds. May the seven mysteries be uplifted, and the hundred passages perfected for immortality. May the registers of death be erased, and our seats established in the mud-pill palace. May our names be recorded in the Eastern Flowery Realm, and our spirits ascend to the void’s mystery. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the incense smoke, conveying our supplications swiftly to the Celestial Worthy of the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Formless and Nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, before the Golden Portal and Jade Steps.\n\nExiting the chamber.\nThus concludes the twelfth scroll of the *Rites of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast*.",

heaven be unified,\nAnd the affairs of all under heaven be accomplished as one.\nMatching the Two Modes in greatness, emerging from the myriad beings to occupy the honored place.\nWith merit unpossessed, they shine as brightly as sun and moon;\nIn magnifying the Dao through non-action, they endure as long as heaven and earth.\nMoreover, with unified enfeoffment and the Six Harmonies as home,\nBenevolent nurturance is surely equitable, and great iron knows no barriers.\nThe Emperor, in sincerity and care, governs by embodying the Dao.\nHe opens the courtyard of benevolence and longevity, weaving the transformation of Huaxu.\nYet now, as certain officials are beset by calamity and misfortune,\nHis celestial compassion is deeply stirred.\nHe issues virtuous decrees and reverently conducts the assembly of blessings,\nPreparing the tenfold splendor of sincere offerings,\nUnfurling the ritual canons of the Three Caverns.\nSeated in the Hall of Audience, he meditates in profound stillness,\nGazing toward the Jade Void and bowing in reverence,\nHoping to rely on purity and cleanliness to achieve resonance and communion.\n\nWe, your servants, having long studied the luminous statutes and reverently followed the mysterious decree,\nHave arrayed the altar and set forth the sacred texts, modeling earth and emulating heaven.\nWith the Emperor’s offerings—golden dragon-patterned silks, incense, flowers, oil, and candles—\nWe follow the standards of the Cavernous Mystery to perform the supreme and wondrous fast.\nWe ascend petitions to the Ten Heavens and pledge oaths to the Three Realms.\nHumbly we pray that the host of sages of the Jade Purity and the boundless exalted ones\nMay look down with favor upon our earnest devotion and greatly extend their grace and forgiveness.\nThey shall command the Four Offices, Five Emperors, Northern Culmen, and Southern Palace\nTo receive the luminous edicts of the Four Poles and uphold the mandates of the Nine Dragons.\nFor these officials, within the celestial bureaus and earthly administrations,\nAmong the talismanic charts and registers of destiny,\nMay they untangle grievances, harmonize debts and disputes,\nAbsolve transgressions, and wash away faults.\nMay they dispel the disasters of stellar conjunctions and the misfortunes of inauspicious years,\nEradicating the accumulated sins of past lives without measure.\nThrough this repentance and prayer, may all be cleansed and dissolved,\nSo that the Nine Ancestral Realms receive blessings and the entire clan be graced with honor.\nMay their years be long and distant, their ranks and emoluments ever-increasing.\nMay a thousand calamities cease and ten thousand virtues be perfected.\nThus shall the transforming grace of the Heavenly Worthy be manifest,\nAnd the earnest wishes of the sagely sovereign be fulfilled.\n\nWe further beseech that the imperial destiny be ever-prosperous,\nThe sagely lifespan prolonged and vast.\nMay all within the realm universally partake of the fruits of the Dao.\nMay the Two Modes shine in peace, the Three Radiances gleam in splendor.\nMay the Nine Grains flourish in abundance, the Five Armies sheathe their weapons.\nMay dragon spirits stand guard, and pestilence be kept at bay.\nMay the sighs of the suffering cease, and the fields resound with songs of joy.\nMay all beings, winged or crawling, fulfill their natures,\nAnd all things, moving or still, flourish in glory.\nMay the Nine Nights reveal their light, and the Three Paths close their gates.\nMay the boundless responses of the Great Dao be witnessed,\nAnd the sagely and enlightened prayers be answered.\nMay all, near and far, ascend the shore of blessings.\nAbove, may the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy be made clear;\nBelow, may the sincerity of our devotion be matched.\nRespectfully we present this petition for your hearing.\n\nWe now raise our thoughts:\nFirst thought: For the Dao, the Four Great Elements unite in virtue.\nMay the seven generations of parents be freed from suffering and sorrow,\nAscend to the heavenly halls, and enjoy natural sustenance.\n\nSecond thought: For the Emperor and lords of the realm,\nMay the Daoist transformation flourish,\nThe schools thrive in abundance, and the imperial teachings expand in grandeur.\nMay their majesty and decorum be revered by all under heaven.\nMay the people proclaim great peace, and the four barbarians submit in awe.\nMay evil and malevolence vanish of themselves, and sages and worthies arise daily.\n\nThird thought: For the Dharma Masters,\nMay their merit and virtue be greatly established,\nTheir teachings enlightened and far-reaching,\nAnd all attain the flight of immortality.\n\nFourth thought: For fellow students of the Dao,\nMay they swiftly attain the immortal way and mutually enlighten one another.\n\nFifth thought: For the harmony of the nine relations,\nMay they esteem virtue and renounce wealth,\nTheir conduct a model for all things.\n\nSixth thought: For self-denial,\nMay alms be given to Daoist priests and the hungry and cold.\nMay all people under heaven find their rightful place.\n\nSeventh thought: For the crawling and creeping, all sentient beings,\nMay all be perfected and accomplished.\n\nEighth thought: For the absolution of past-life and present sins,\nMay merits be established to atone for transgressions.\n\nNinth thought: For the prosperity of family and state,\nMay ancestral temples be maintained and worthy talents arise in every generation.\n\nTenth thought: For the reverence of scriptural masters,\nMay none grow lax or unequal in their devotion.\nWith a single mind and boundless compassion,\nMay they attain the rank of immortals,\nAscend to heaven in broad daylight,\nAnd pay

the Mystic Realm.\n\nReiterating the Dharma Titles:\nDisciple of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Mystic Capital, Supreme Master of the Three Caverns,\nYour servant [Name] respectfully invokes once more the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning;\nThe Supreme Lord of the Great Dao;\nThe Supreme Lord Lao;\nThe hosts of sagely and virtuous beings of the Boundless Dao and Power in the ten directions;\nThe Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;\nThe Heavenly Master, Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;\nThe High Ministers, High Chancellors, High Protectors, High Tutors;\nThe Four Directors and Five Emperors;\nAll the divine officials and revered spirits of the Three Realms.\n\nWe, your servants, have heard that the Dao’s workings unfold,\nAnd the true scriptures spread their transforming influence.\nThe luminous precepts and wondrous teachings\nAwaken those in the heavens and the human realm;\nThe sacred registers and marvelous texts\nAre proclaimed to those in darkness and stagnation.\nThus, the Three Vehicles and Three Caverns\nGuide the lost and grieving to return;\nThe dragon scripts and phoenix writings\nAssist the state and bring forth blessings.\nWith profound sincerity and responsive resonance,\nThe empty chamber connects to the true.\nAll rests in utmost devotion,\nTo honor and receive divine grace.\n\nReverently considering the Great Dao,\nIt silently aids the Emperor’s work.\nThe Emperor, in his official capacity, encounters obscurity and adversity,\nYet his compassionate concern runs deep.\nTo dispel and resolve these, he seeks to preserve purity and peace.\nOffering dragon jades, incense, flowers, and patterned silks as ritual tokens,\nHe establishes a fast and erects an altar.\nWe, your servants, undeservingly hold office in the Mystic Bureau,\nAnd reverently receive the enlightened command.\nFollowing the ritual codes and forms,\nWe earnestly invoke the true spirits.\nBurning incense and lighting lamps,\nWe illuminate the darkest nights.\nAbove, they shine upon the halls of blessings;\nBelow, they open the courts of the unseen and benighted.\nFor [Name], we repent and offer gratitude for the living and the dead,\nReconciling karmic adversaries.\nFor so many days and nights,\nWe perform the Dao and recite the scriptures.\nWe repent for the nine generations and seven lineages,\nFor past lives and the present existence.\nFor transgressions in the unseen and manifest realms,\nFor faults and flaws in life and death.\nFor malevolent karmic ties and the roots of sin,\nFor past debts and ancient enmities.\nFor the nine palaces and eight trigrams,\nFor the three destinies and five phases.\nFor the dark and bright stars,\nFor boundless calamities and misfortunes.\nThrough this prayer and repentance,\nWe beseech their complete eradication.\nMay the ancestral spirits ascend,\nAnd accumulated faults be pardoned.\nMay misfortune dissolve with repentance,\nAnd fortune follow wishes to arrive.\nMay a hundred blessings suffuse,\nAnd a thousand disasters be cleansed.\nMay official emoluments and blessings be renewed,\nAnd years of life extended.\nEver serving the sagely court,\nAbove, repaying the Emperor’s grace;\nBelow, may the two forces maintain their purity,\nAnd the three luminaries radiate splendor.\nMay the five planets follow their courses,\nAnd the eight winds harmonize.\nMay the precious chart stand firm,\nAnd the sagely reign endure.\nSurpassing the ways of emperors and kings,\nPacifying the nine regions and purifying the myriad states.\nMay the six palaces and hundred offices\nProclaim virtue within and beyond.\nMay the Crown Prince and the various princes\nAssist with wisdom and sagacity.\nMay the years be free of pestilence,\nAnd the people sing in praise.\nMay the world know great peace,\nAnd all beings fulfill their nature.\nIn the depths of the darkest nights,\nWhether moving or still, flying or sinking,\nMay all share in the merit of this repentance and gratitude,\nAnd together awaken to the Dao of mystic communion.\nAbove, may the Heavenly Venerable’s vast grace of deliverance be manifest;\nBelow, may our repentance and gratitude be sincere.\nRespectfully, we make this invocation known.\n\n**Vows**\n\nFirst Vow:\nMay the Great Dao be serene and formless,\nAbiding in

The [deceased] official, grieving beyond the gates of the nether springs, cherishes remembrance in the hidden earth. We, in reverent cultivation of supreme merit, array the altar precincts, hoping to invoke the compassion of the Most Sagely and relieve the torments of the underworld’s barriers. Moreover, in obedience to the imperial edict, how dare we not make this known above?\n\n**Reading the Petition**\nAs the petition states, it is fitting to submit this plea.\n\nWe, your servants, reverently follow the wondrous decrees of the Nine Heavens and the scriptures of the Three Registers.

drifting, adrift and submerged,\nsuch has been the unceasing plight from ancient times to the present.\n\nUnless one is endowed with the qi of the Dao from birth,\nor heaven-bestowed with immortal talent,\none cannot shatter the chariot of misfortune by ascending the ranks of blessings,\nnor traverse the cloud-lined thoroughfare to transcend the earthly realm.\nIn this fleeting, floating world,\nwho can escape the wheel of rebirth?\n\nThis official, since his birth into this life and through countless kalpas past,\nhas accumulated transgressions,\nhis sins amassing like a string of beads.\n\nAs a military officer, he may have drilled troops and commanded armies,\npunished the wicked and suppressed rebels,\nor in the midst of mowing down and eradicating,\nfound jade and stone indistinguishable.\nThough his service to the times may have been tied to establishing merit,\nhis reliance on killing and his pursuit of victory\nhave inevitably incurred guilt.\n\nMoreover, in the course of feasts and rewards,\nthere must be slaughter and roasting.\nIn enforcing the laws to punish the wicked,\nthere must be the execution of penal codes.\nThus, in cases of accidental or mistaken killing,\ntransgressions and violations are unavoidable.\n\nOr when soldiers march through camps and fortifications,\nencroaching upon and desecrating ancient tombs,\noffending and provoking dragon spirits,\ndigging and excavating hills and plains,\ndefiling and polluting springs and streams,\ntrampling sacred lands,\nand defiling numinous traces—\nthese acts may stem from unresolved past debts\nor unredressed former grievances.\n\nOr when, in the course of official duties,\nhe has wielded authority with personal bias,\nhis judgments in life bearing the stain of guilt,\nand in death facing karmic retribution—\nin the dark, hidden prisons of the underworld,\nthere is no means of repentance or redemption.\n\nAs a civil official, when administering affairs,\nhe may have acted willfully and indulged his inclinations,\nweighing punishments and discerning cases\nwithout regard for compassion or mercy,\nenforcing the law and upholding regulations\nwithout thought of pardon or leniency.\nIn matters of granting or withholding, encouraging or discouraging,\nhe may have erred in balancing severity and leniency.\nIn levying and collecting taxes,\nhe may have harmed through harshness and urgency,\nprovoking the resentment of people and the grievance of all things.\nThese offenses, once firmly established,\nmay stem from past debts or former grievances,\nor from defying heaven and betraying earth,\nyet he has never offered repentance or atonement.\nAccumulated in the courts of the underworld,\nsince the time of his death,\nkarmic retribution has befallen him,\nwith no means of deliverance or redemption.\n\nThe Emperor, mindful of his past merits\nand grieving for his journey to the netherworld,\nhas examined the standards of the Purple Yang,\nand unfolded the statutes of repentance and deliverance.\nHe has solemnly established the magnificent altar,\nand reverently implored the boundless grace of the heavens.\n\nWe humbly beseech the host of saints and sages of the myriad heavens,\nand the Three Supreme Venerables,\nto turn their limitless mercy\nand bestow the great compassion of their grace.\nMay they command the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus,\nthe Five Emperors and Four Offices,\nthe Thirty-Six Prisons of Mount Tai and Fengdu,\nto reconcile grievances and dissolve karmic retribution,\nto erase and cast away the records of sins.\nBy the edict of great pardon,\nmay he be released from the depths of darkness,\nreceive transformation in the Southern Palace,\nand be born upon the path of blessings.\nMay nine generations and seven lineages\ntogether partake in this radiant protection.\n\nMay all beings in the Three Paths and Six Realms,\nof every rank and kind,\nwhether moving or still, flying or submerged,\nascend to the shore of blessings.\nMay the Three Luminaries display auspicious signs,\nand the Four Seasons attain perfect harmony.\nMay the sacred lifespan be long and enduring,\nand the nation’s fortune prosperous and eternal.\nMay weapons be laid to rest,\nand plagues and poisons vanish.\nMay the hundred grains ever flourish,\nand all under heaven enjoy peace and prosperity.\n\nThus, the great compassion of the Most High Heavenly Venerable\nshall be manifest above,\nand the sincerity of our devotion in seeking refuge\nshall be fulfilled below.\n\nWe reverently present this petition for your hearing.\n\n**Invocation of Intentions**\n\nFirst intention: For the four great elements of the Dao,\nand the host of the retreat’s virtuous patrons—\nmay the seven generations of parents\nbe freed from sorrow and suffering,\nascend to the heavenly halls,\nand enjoy natural sustenance.\n\nSecond intention: For the Emperor and the lords of the realm—\nmay the Dao’s transformation flourish and

people praise the Great Peace,\nand the four barbarians submit in deference.\nMay evil and malevolence self-destruct,\nand the worthy and sagely be born daily.\n\nThird intention: For the Dharma Master—\nmay his merit and virtue be greatly established,\nhis teachings enlightened and far-reaching,\nand may he, together with all, attain transcendence as an immortal.\n\nFourth intention: For fellow aspirants and disciples—\nmay they swiftly attain the Dao of immortality,\nand mutually guide and deliver one another.\n\nFifth intention: For the harmony of the nine relations—\nmay they

and the hungry and cold.\nMay all people under heaven\neach find their rightful place.\n\nSeventh intention: For the crawling and creeping,\nall sentient beings—\nmay they all attain fulfillment.\n\nEighth intention: For the remission of past lives’ sins\nand this life’s karmic retribution—\nmay merits be established to compensate for transgressions.\n\nNinth intention: For the

      "translated_text": "A single lapse in vital essence severs one forever from the realm of the worthy.\nThrough endless nights unbroken, ten thousand kalpas stretch without end.\nThus, as the Celestial Venerable surveys the Eight Gates, He reveals the scriptures of salvation for the living;\nMoved by compassion for the Three Realms, the Lord of the Dao proclaims the ordinances for deliverance from death.\nThat all may together ascend the courts of fortune and transcend the sea of desire.\nThe true scriptures and their wondrous purport rectify the state and transform the people.\nThe Emperor, mindful of the departed souls, publicly issues his sacred edict.\nIn accordance with the statutes of the Three Clarities, he opens the altar of the Nine Memorials.\nWith oil lamps, candles, incense, and flowers, he offers his sincerity to the host of sages.\nWith silk and ritual tokens, he presents his supplications to the myriad heavens.\nBurning incense, kindling lamps, reciting scriptures, and pacing the Dao,\nHe purifies his heart and cleanses his thoughts, prostrating himself to entreat the Perfected.\nHe hopes that the divine radiance of the Eight Luminaries will descend to illuminate the dark prisons of the netherworld,\nAnd that the talismanic commands of the Nine Dragons will swiftly arrive at the courts of accumulated night.\nTo deliver the souls in ceremony, raising them from the winding springs of the Yellow Springs.\nTo absolve and release [Name] Official, for transgressions across past lives and the present existence,\nFor boundless kalpas of accumulated faults and grievous errors, for past enmities and debts owed,\nWhether committed by oneself or bequeathed by ancestors,\nThe offenses are manifold, beyond memory or reckoning.\nSome defy Heaven and Earth, betraying the divine spirits;\nSome harm others or injure creatures.\nIn death, they suffer retribution, enduring it for years on end.\nWithout the mysterious power of the Dao, there is no means of release.\nNow, by the merit of this great fast and the cause of repentance and deliverance,\nMay the ten thousand sins and thousand transgressions all be eradicated and washed away.\nMay the divine souls be purified and serene, their sins and afflictions dissolved and pacified.\nMay they depart suffering, escape premature death, and attain realization of the Dao alongside the Perfected.\nMoreover, for the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages of the departed,\nMay they together bathe in this sublime merit and ascend the path of fortune.\nMay auspicious protection and blessings extend to the living.\nAbove, may the Two Images be clear and tranquil, the Three Luminaries harmonious and bright.\nMay wind and clouds follow their proper order, and malevolent forces sink and vanish.\nMay the imperial reign be boundless, and the Sacred Personage enjoy ten thousand years of life.\nMay the three agricultural seasons yield abundant harvests, with sprouting grain and ripening ears;\nMay the four seas be linked by ships and roads, with tribute of celestial beasts and rare fragrances.\nMay the empress, consorts, and imperial concubines, the crown prince and the various princes,\nSupport and assist the purple court, safeguarding the imperial ultimate.\nMay the dukes, ministers, and aides, the loyal and virtuous civil and military officials,\nAssist the ninefold throne and harmonize the eight directions.\nMay weapons be sheathed and silenced, and the myriad peoples enjoy peace and prosperity.\nExtending to the dragons of water and land, and all creatures that fly or dwell below,\nMay the merit of this fast reach them, and its beneficence spread far and wide.\nThroughout the seas and the world within, may all attain the realm of longevity.\nAbove, may the great compassion of the Radiant Celestial Venerable be manifest;\nBelow, may the sincerity of our repentance and gratitude be fulfilled.\n\nWe humbly present this entreaty.\n\n**Vows**\n\nFirst Vow: May the Great Dao be serene and void, tranquil and empty.\nMay it dwell in stillness and clarity, opening wide the gates of the Dharma,\nInstructing the stubborn and guiding them with beneficence,\nThat all may cultivate with diligence and, joining the ranks of fellow learners,\nTogether ascend the void, preserving harmony with Heaven,\nAnd abide in eternal peace without sorrow.\n\nSecond Vow: May the myriad heavens condense their qi and become pure.\nMay the high void broadly cover, preserving the true and securing the numinous.\nMay the climate be harmonious, the four seasons balanced and peaceful.\nMay the state be secure and the people prosperous, the world at rest and tranquil.\nMay all be universally saved, and beneficence extend to all living beings.\nMay the kalpa be preserved long, enduring for countless kalpas without decline.\n\nThird Vow: May the earth, in its boundless embrace,\nBe stable and unshaken, the seas calm and uncollapsed.\nMay it safeguard and secure the state and the people,\nNurturing life and comforting the dead, its beneficence pervading the ten directions.\nMay crops flourish and commerce thrive day by day.\nMay all receive its abundant support, and the myriad beings follow in harmony.\n\nFourth Vow: May the sun and moon, the two luminaries, shine brightly on high.\nWithout eclipse or dimming, may they remain constant and clear.\nMay their light illuminate the heavens, dispelling all darkness.\nMay they safeguard the kalpa and the world, ensuring peace and harmony.\nMay their beneficence and moisture universally bestow blessings upon all beings.\n\nFifth Vow: May the stars shine with brilliance equal to the sun.\nMay their revolving light illuminate the ten directions.\nMay each remain in its proper place, moving in straight paths.\nMay they safeguard the state and the people, free from calamity or harm.\nMay the four seas be united in peace, and the world flourish in prosperity.\n\nSixth Vow: May the four seasons progress in due order.\nMay the climate be harmonious and temperate, free from disaster or affliction.\nMay plagues and poisons vanish, and the world enjoy peace and tranquility.\nMay the five grains ripen abundantly, the state be wealthy, and the people joyful.\n\nSeventh Vow: May floating clouds gather their qi and condense into mist.\nSoaring high and clear, they shade the mysterious and profound.\nIn concealment, they are quiescent; when dispersed, they fill the heavens.\nMay immortals and transcendents dwell together, befriending the host of Perfected.\nMay beneficence flow to all, fostering the state and cherishing the people.\nMay all beings be universally saved, and humanity endure for kalpas to come.\n\nEighth Vow: May wind

end.\nMay they protect and deliver all, none failing to revere them.\n\nTenth Vow: May the rivers and seas be vast and boundless,\nContaining and embracing all, nurturing even the smallest beings.\nProfound and gentle, may they moisten and nourish all that wriggles and breathes.\nMay Heaven and humanity receive blessings, their years enduring like the kalpa’s stone.\n\nEleventh Vow: May the Emperor’s domain flourish day by day.\nMay the four frontiers be peaceful and harmonious, weapons of war stilled.\nMay Heaven and humanity sing in praise, auspicious days dawning.\nMay teachings be disseminated and governance flourish,\nThe myriad people rejoicing without end.\n\nTwelfth Vow: May all creatures that fly or crawl, born or unborn,\nAll be secure and universally attain life and growth.\nMay they all perceive the primordial qi and receive the forms of yang.\nMay grasses, trees, fruits, and forests endure winter without withering.\nMay all be delivered and none fail to flourish in splendor.\n\nMay harmony and the Dao unite with the true,\nAnd the furnace be restored.",

      "translated_text": "**Threefold Invocation**\n\nThe Great Dao pervades the Mysterious Void,\nWith devotion, none fails to align.\nRefining the essence, one enters the Immortal True,\nAnd attains the Vajra body.\nTranscending the Three Realms’ trials,\nThe Five Sufferings of Hell dissolve.\nAll return to the Supreme Scriptures;\nIn stillness, we bow in reverence.\n\n**Threefold Prostration**\n\nWe, your servants, wholeheartedly prostrate and bow to the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao.\nWe, your servants, wholeheartedly prostrate and bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, wholeheartedly prostrate and bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Realm.\n\n**Reaffirming the Dharma Rank**\n\nWe, disciples of the Supreme Clarity and Mysterious Capital, your servants [Name] and others, with utmost sincerity, jointly invoke:\nThe Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin;\nThe Supreme Lord of the Great Dao;\nThe Supreme Lord Lao;\nThe Most Perfect, Spontaneous, Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy;\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Cries and Saves from Suffering;\nThe Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;\nThe Heavenly Master and Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Realm;\nThe Supreme Ministers and Prime Ministers;\nThe Five Elderly Lords of the Supreme;\nThe Lords of the Three Primes;\nThe Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water;\nAnd all the responsive and efficacious venerable spirits of the Three Realms.\n\nWe, your servants, have heard that the Great Sages unfolded the cosmic plan, and the Primordial Sovereign guided the course of destiny. The celestial gates nurture all life, while the earthly records shape all things. Among all beings, humans are the most spiritually endowed, standing above all other creatures. Yet as yin and yang alternate, the nature and consciousness of beings ebb and flow. In conduct, there arise distinctions of good and evil; in movement and stillness, outcomes of fortune and misfortune are determined. Through sin and blessing, one ascends or descends; through life and death, one is separated or united. Therefore, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and the Heavenly Great Sage, in their boundless compassion, issued the decree of salvation and opened the gate of protection. They commanded the Five Emperors and Four Controllers to extend their mechanisms of deliverance, and the hosts of the Three Primes and all the Sages to respond and govern. The Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water revealed the principles of judgment, while the clerks of the yin and yang bureaus proclaimed the rites of retribution. Their intent was to enable all to ascend the steps of blessing and together transcend the net of sin. Yet the deluded remain hard to awaken, and the turbid hard to purify. Transgressions and errors accumulate without end.\n\nThis official, from past lives to the present, through countless kalpas, has undergone the revolutions of rebirth. Whether through the constructions of the six senses or the deeds of the three karmas, the offenses are manifold and beyond recollection. At times, leading armies and commanding multitudes, he waged campaigns in all directions. At others, upholding the law and maintaining order, he regulated and restrained others. Sometimes punishing the wicked and suppressing the violent, he wielded the axe to assert authority. Or protecting the weak and curbing the strong, he dispensed rewards and meted out punishments. At times, undertaking construction and earthworks, he offended the dragon spirits. Or hosting banquets and feasting guests, he slaughtered living beings. Sometimes angling for the hidden or fowling the roosting, he galloped in the hunt. Or adjudicating legal codes, he judged cases with partiality. At times, swayed by love and hate, joy and anger, he indulged his whims. The sorrows of the living and the grievances of the dead accumulated as unrepented sins in the dark underworld. The Three Officials record the names of the guilty, and the Five Emperors tally the accounts of retribution. In the shadowy night prisons, to whom can one turn for deliverance?\n\nThe Emperor, moved by compassion for the suffering souls, wishes to elevate and deliver them. Following the regulations and standards, he has solemnly established the altar. Divine lamps scatter their radiance through the Nine Netherworlds, and incense wafts its fragrance across the Three Realms. We universally repent sins before all the heavens and pray for grace throughout the Ten Directions. We humbly beseech the Supreme Sages and High Worthies to shine their merciful light in pity; may the Three Officials and Five Emperors let their vast blessings flow abundantly. Bestow boundless grace and magnify the great acts of compassion. May all sins, without exception, be washed away. Even those in the Four Extremes and the Ten Immortals shall be discerned and illuminated. Draw them forth from the depths of the Dark Prison and guide them to the Courts of Flowing Fire. Purify their forms and souls, and bathe their spirits. May they ascend to the Realm of Eternal Joy and soar to the Upper Palaces. Realize the Dao and partake in the True, forever escaping the dark night.\n\nMay all past grievances and debts be resolved with devotion. May accumulated sins and residual calamities dissolve in an instant. May descendants enjoy blessings, and may distant ancestors ascend. May all beings—whether moving or still, flying or submerged—within the suffering realms touched by this ritual’s merit, together partake in auspicious fortune.\n\n**Supreme Vows**\n\nMay the sun and moon shine with steadfast clarity, and may Heaven and Earth stand firm in peace. May the stars and constellations be auspicious, and may wind and rain be timely. May the great enterprise flourish, and may the Sacred Person enjoy myriad years. May the imperial lineage, like the branches of Heaven, forever shade the Eight Extremes; may civil virtue and martial prowess encompass the Nine Provinces in transformation. May weapons be sheathed, and may the harvests be abundant. Within and beyond the realm, may all attain benevolence and longevity.\n\nAbove, may the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy be manifest; below, may the sincerity of our devotion be fulfilled.\n\n**Vows**\n\nFirst, may the Great Dao spread and flow, and may all under Heaven embrace virtue.\nSecond, may all sentient beings awaken to the Dao.\nThird, may the sorrowful souls of the Nine Nights all attain liberation.\nFourth, may the lonely and unattached spirits all receive rebirth.\nFifth, may the world know great peace, and may the five grains be abundant.\nSixth, may ministers be loyal and children filial, may rulers be benevolent and fathers kind.\nSeventh, may the Four Seas be united, and may the six relations be harmonious.\nEighth, may the hidden in wombs and the sheltered in eggs all attain birth and growth.\nNinth, may chronic and acute illnesses swiftly be cured.\nTenth, may the destitute and exposed among the living be clothed and fed.\n\n**Replenishing the Incense Burner**\n\nIncense Official Messengers, Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all the Attendant Spirit Officials: At this place where we face the Origin, may the golden liquid elixir and the azure mushroom naturally arise. May the hosts of the Hundred Spirits and all the Perfected gather here before the incense burner and the altar of fragrant fire. May we who study the Dao attain the Dao, and those who seek immortality attain immortality. May the patrons of this ritual receive blessings, and may both the hidden and manifest realms be graced with favor. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the Ten Directions, guarding the orchid incense, swiftly transmit our recent invocations directly to the presence of the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Most Perfect Jade Emperor.\n\n**Exiting the Chamber**\n\nHere concludes the eighteenth scroll of the *Rites of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast*.",

With regal tassels draped and screens of state behind, the sovereign presides over the myriad regions.

      "translated_text": "Should we express our unadorned sincerity, it shall surely reach the august spirits.\n\nWe reflect that from the inception of creation to this very day, the sovereign cannot spread transformation without the people, nor can the people attain tranquility without the sovereign. The sovereign aligns with Heaven, and the king establishes the ultimate standard. How could they not draw upon the power of creation and rely upon divine efficacy? Only then can they transmit glory through generations and perpetuate blessings across the ages.\n\nSince the primordial past, states and households have endured. Those who faithfully adhere to the principles of purity and quiescence are graced by the profound blessings of the Mysterious Origin. The Emperor, upholding Heaven’s mandate and grasping the cosmic order, has assumed the throne in accordance with destiny. Reverent, frugal, benevolent, and harmonious, he labors diligently over all affairs of state, ever more vigilant with each passing day. Yet even as he governs with ceaseless diligence, darkness and adversity still afflict the realm. Without recourse to the Supreme Dao, how could peace and deliverance be achieved?\n\nThe official [Name], long renowned for his great merit, redoubles his earnest devotion. Devoted to the sovereign and the state, he knows no rest. Thus, with utmost reverence, he prepares fragrant flowers, abundant offerings, and solemn pledges of faith. Laying bare his heart before the Three Realms, he bows in homage to the heavens. He exhausts his luminous sincerity, humbly beseeching auspicious protection.\n\nMay his crimson petition ascend, and the profound grace of the Mysterious descend. May the awe-inspiring power of transformation be bestowed, preserving the Emperor’s distant and enduring reign. Let the decree command the Nine Heavens, and the celestial hosts patrol the Eight Extremities. May wind and thunder sweep away the miasmic vapors, clearing the cosmos, and annihilate calamities to secure the altars of state. Let treacherous omens be purged, the sun and moon shine with steadfast clarity, and comets and baleful stars be driven away. May weapons of war melt like ice, rebellious ministers and their factions reform their hearts, and epidemic plagues and malevolent spirits vanish like clouds dispersed by lightning.\n\nMay the Hua and Yi peoples alike joyfully follow the winds of virtue, and the entire realm delight in the radiance of sagely governance. May the official [Name] enjoy emoluments as lofty as Mount Song and Mount Heng, and years as enduring as the pine and cassia. May he forever uphold loyalty and filial piety in service to his sovereign and parents. May the Emperor’s sagely longevity rise like the North Star and Mount Tai, his illustrious reign extend as far as the heavens and earth endure. May all beings, seen and unseen, ascend to the realm of longevity.\n\nThus, the transformative compassion of the Most High Heavenly Worthy is made manifest, and the sincerity of your servants’ devotion is answered.\n\nWith reverence, we make this declaration.\n\n**Invocation of Intentions**\n\nFirst intention: For the Dao, the Four Great Elements unite in virtue. May the seven generations of the retreat’s sponsor be freed from sorrow and suffering, ascend to the heavenly halls, and enjoy natural sustenance.\n\nSecond intention: For the Emperor and rulers of states, may the Dao’s transformation flourish. May schools and academies thrive, the imperial teachings expand, and solemn decorum be universally observed. May the people praise great peace, the four barbarians submit in reverence, evil vanish of itself, and sages and worthies arise daily.\n\nThird intention: For the Dharma Master, may great merit be established. May teachings be luminous and enlightened, and all attain transcendence.\n\nFourth intention: For fellow practitioners of the Dao, may they swiftly attain immortality and mutually guide one another.\n\nFifth intention: For the nine relations to live in harmony, esteeming benevolence and righteousness, prizing the Dao and despising wealth, serving as models for all.\n\nSixth intention: For those who humble themselves to bestow alms, Daoists and the hungry and cold. May all people under heaven find their rightful place.\n\nSeventh intention: For crawling and creeping creatures, all sentient beings, may they all achieve fulfillment.\n\nEighth intention: For the pardon of past lives’ transgressions. May this life’s karmic retribution be redressed through meritorious deeds.\n\nNinth intention: For the prosperity of family and state. May ancestral temples be maintained, and worthy talents arise in every generation.\n\nTenth intention: For revering the master and the scriptures. May we never falter in devotion, cultivating equanimity and single-mindedness. May all beings be broadly delivered, attaining the rank of immortals, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, and paying homage to the Most High. May we forever become perfected beings, riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages, harmonizing with the Dao and uniting with the Real.\n\n**Replenishing the Incense Burner**",

Comets and baleful stars conceal their forms, while auspicious stars manifest their blessings. The eight winds align in sequence, the six qi balance in harmony. Drought and flood are averted, disasters and malevolent forces eradicated. Mountains and rivers remain serene, fierce beasts retreat and vanish. Customs become pure and virtuous, creatures free from plague. Ghosts and demons flee without trace, evil and perverse forces are crushed and destroyed. Barbarians submit in reverence, borderlands enjoy peace. Treacherous ministers and rebellious sons offer loyalty and devotion. Beacons remain unlit, weapons fall silent. The imperial enterprise flourishes, the sagely lifespan endures. The court abounds in loyal and worthy officials, the countryside harbors no neglected talents. The six palaces and hundred ministers together propagate the wind of virtue and power; the crown prince and various kings jointly support the vast and grand enterprise. Ships and caravans gather in full, harvests are ever abundant. May Official So-and-so be truly blessed with auspicious fortune, his official emoluments and state sacrifices renewed.\n\nMay even those in the dark springs and cold underworld, the six destinies and three paths, be illuminated by the radiance of wisdom, forever dispelling gloom and obscurity. May the divine wind cleanse impurities, attaining perfect coolness and purity. May all crawling, flying, sinking, and soaring beings ascend to the Dharma realm. Above, may the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy be manifest; below, may the sincerity of our repentance and gratitude be fulfilled.\n\nWe respectfully present this supplication for your hearing.\n\n**Vows**\nFirst vow: May the Great Dao flow universally, and all under Heaven embrace virtue.\nSecond vow: May all sentient beings awaken to the Dao.\nThird vow: May the souls in the nine nights of darkness attain liberation at once.\nFourth vow: May the lonely and unsupported spirits all receive rebirth.\nFifth vow: May the world enjoy great peace and the five grains abundant harvests.\nSixth vow: May ministers be loyal and sons filial, rulers benevolent and fathers kind.\nSeventh vow: May the four seas be united, and enmities and affections reconciled.\nEighth vow: May those in hidden wombs and eggs all attain birth and completion.\nNinth vow: May chronic and recent illnesses swiftly be healed.\nTenth vow: May orphaned and destitute beings enjoy ample clothing and food.\n\n**Replenishing the Incense Burner**\nIncense Official Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Attendant Incense Spirits, and all divine officials: at the place where we conduct the Dao, may golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms naturally arise. May the hundred spirits and host of Perfected Ones gather here before the incense burner and sacred flame. May we, your servants, who study the Dao attain the Dao, and those who seek immortality attain immortality. May the nation receive blessings, and both the hidden and manifest realms be graced with favor.\n\nMay the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions, attending the orchid-scented smoke, swiftly transmit our recent supplications directly to the presence of the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Utmost Perfected Jade Emperor.\n\n**Exiting the Chamber**\nHere concludes the twenty-first scroll of the *Rites of the Supreme Yellow Register Fast*.",

Step into the void, circling the Supreme Ultimate—its height and depth divide, the light and pure ascending to join Heaven.\n\nShould one cultivate the utmost Dao,\nthe body becomes a true immortal.\nTheir deeds surpass the three thousand,\ntheir time spans forty thousand years.\nThe cinnabar terrace opens its treasure scrolls,\nthe golden mouth transmits the flow.\nThe Great Brahmā, Lord of the Three Heavens,\nthe Five Venerable Ones of the Void Sovereign—\neven they scarcely glimpse its wondrous subtlety,\nhow much less can it be captured in words.\nThe jeweled throne descends upon the golden hall,\nthe rosy crown illumines the jade pavilion.\nMyriad perfected ones attend the imperial court,\ntheir flying sandals treading the roots of clouds.\nMisty as fine mist, drifting,\ntheir gossamer robes trail gently.\nExquisite, they ascend with auspicious smoke,\nlightly following the soaring phoenix.\nHaving partaken in the jade chamber’s feast,\nthey suddenly point toward the grotto-heaven’s return.\nStanding at Fusang’s shore,\nthey race toward the radiance of the Sun Emperor.\n\n**Three Bows**\nWe, your servants, prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity to the Supreme and Boundless Dao of the Great Ultimate.\nWe, your servants, prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\n**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**\nWe, your humble servants [Name] and others, now reverently reaffirm and address the Supreme and Boundless Dao, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning; the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao and the host of sagely ones of virtue; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; the High Ministers and Prime Chancellors, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, and all divine officials of the Three Realms.\n\nWe have heard that the Great Dao sheds its light, spreading harmony and transformation. It shapes and steeps the primordial qi, giving birth to the Three Powers. Yin and yang alternate in their cycles, kalpas rise and fall in their destined turns. Endowed with spirit and nurtured in form, beings take shape and flow into manifestation. Before transcending the mechanism of change, they are bound to signs of prosperity and decline. Without invoking the supreme sages, blessings are hard to bestow.\n\nWe reflect upon the jade books of the Three Caverns, the golden tablets of the Nine Heavens—turtle-scripted phoenix scrolls, dragon-sealed tiger tallies. These can stabilize emperors and kings, safeguarding the kalpas; embodying the boundless Dao, they endure with Heaven. Next, they can restore the celestial canon, altering the course of disasters; pacifying families and protecting nations, aiding beings and bringing peace to people. The netherworld receives their deliverance, and the distressed find means of expiation. When fragrant incense ascends, sincere prayers surely reach. When the true register is presented, the august spirits surely witness.\n\nThe disciple [Name], fearing misfortune in their fate and deeply troubled, presents offerings and petitions, praying for manifest protection. We, having received the luminous teachings, exhort and guide the Dharma stream. Following the mystic statutes, we undertake this fast to cultivate blessings, invoking the Three Realms and repenting to the Ten Directions. Pouring forth our sincerity, we turn the scriptures and perform the Dao. Lamps divide like crane flames, dispelling darkness with flowing radiance; incense scatters like dragon smoke, piercing the void to convey our faith.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Celestial Worthy and the Supreme Ones bestow their compassionate salvation; that the Golden Towers and Jade Capitals, the thousand perfected ones, extend their protective power. May decrees descend upon the Three Realms, universally proclaiming to all heavens. Bestow blessings, extend grace, deliver the living and ferry the dead. Reconcile grievances, dissolve disasters. Let the five phases avoid harmful clashes, and the three luminaries cease inauspicious conjunctions. Above, resolve the afflictions of celestial bodies and the twelve celestial mansions; below, resolve the calamities of mountains and rivers, the nine palaces, and the eight trigrams’ domains.\n\nFor accumulated transgressions and deep misfortunes, layered disasters; for past grievances and old debts, unintended killings and mistaken harms; for the three karmas and six emotions, boundless offenses—through this repentance, we beseech their complete eradication.\n\nWe pray that the nation’s destiny be prolonged, the sage’s longevity eternal; that the three luminaries shine brightly, the four seasons harmonize. May weapons of war not rise, beacon fires cease their warnings. May evil demons hide, auspicious omens arrive. Floods, fires, droughts, locusts, wars, and plagues—may none assail our borders, and may perfect peace be preserved.\n\nWe further pray that the seven generations of ancestors ascend to Heaven, the nine depths of darkness be released from confrontation. May all beings, flying and crawling, fulfill their natures and dwell in peace. May the earthly prisons and yin tribunals, the three paths and six destinies, all ascend to the shore of blessings, bathed in the wind of the Dao.\n\nAbove, may the Celestial Worthy’s vast salvific grace be manifest; below, may it match the sincerity of we, your servants, in our devotion. We reverently present this petition.\n\n**Invoking the Ten Resolutions**\nFirst resolve: For the four great elements of the Dao, in harmony with the virtue of the fast’s sponsor. May the seven generations of parents escape suffering and sorrow, ascend to Heaven’s halls, and enjoy natural sustenance.\n\nSecond resolve: For the emperor and sovereign, may the Dao’s transformation flourish. May academies thrive, the imperial teachings expand. May their majesty be awe-inspiring, witnessed by all under Heaven. May the people praise great peace, the four barbarians submit. May evil demons perish, sages and worthies be born daily.\n\nThird resolve: For the Dharma masters, may their merit and virtue be greatly established. May their teachings be clear and far-reaching, all attaining immortality.\n\nFourth resolve: For fellow practitioners. May they swiftly attain the immortal Dao, mutually guiding and delivering one another.\n\nFifth resolve: For the nine relations to be harmonious, valuing benevolence and righteousness. May they honor the Dao and despise wealth, their conduct a model for all.\n\nSixth resolve: For self-denial, bestowing alms upon Daoists and the hungry and cold. May all people under Heaven find their rightful place.\n\nSeventh resolve: For crawling and creeping creatures, all sentient beings. May they all receive fulfillment.\n\nEighth resolve: For pardoning past lives’ debts. May this life’s karmic retribution be resolved through merit, amending past wrongs.\n\nNinth resolve: For the prosperity of family and nation. May ancestral temples have descendants, and worthy talents be born in every generation.\n\nTenth resolve: For honoring the scripture masters. May we never falter, maintaining equanimity and single-mindedness. May we broadly deliver all beings, attaining the highest immortality, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight, paying homage to the Supreme. May we forever become perfected ones, riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages, merging in harmony with the True.\n\n**Returning to the Brazier**",

may his chariot tracks unify all under heaven.\nMay inner and outer realms be harmonious and peaceful; may the constant norms be properly ordered.\n\nThus do we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely hosts, the perfected and true virtues, that after attaining the Dao, we may ascend into the formless.\nHarmonizing with the Dao, we attain the true.\n\nTonight, as we conduct the evening Dao procession, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the second pinch of incense.\nMay this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Utmost True *Scripture* Treasure.\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Most High.\nMay this merit flow to the disciple [name]’s household.\nMay their numinous essence endure for a hundred million generations;

      "translated_text": "Yet our traces mingle with the marketplace and court, our merits as light as dust and dew. Ever deepening our vigilance and fear, we dare not rest in ease. Yet the Dharma demands propagation, and duty calls first to deliverance and salvation.\n\nNow the patron of this retreat, [Name], pressed by calamitous celestial omens and assailed by illness and distress, grieves as if life were a flickering candle, his very existence imperiled. Today, he lays bare his heart to plead for life, prostrating at the gate of the Dharma. We, your servants, accordingly follow the luminous ordinances, conducting this retreat and performing the Dao. We inscribe the petitions, enumerate the transgressions, and offer repentance for both the living and the dead.\n\nWe fear that through nine generations, karmic misfortunes have flowed and accumulated; that in past lives and former ages, grievances have knotted and congealed. Perhaps in resolve or thought, he has transgressed against hidden virtue; or in emotion or intent, failed to align with the numinous. Past faults and former errors, hidden sins and manifest transgressions—all these causes and conditions, layer upon layer, have woven this disaster and peril.\n\nWe further fear that in the three destinies and five phases, the nine palaces and eight trigrams, the celestial patterns and stellar constellations, the revolutions of fate and the cycles of years, baleful influences have descended, and stars have cast their baleful light. Perhaps his life’s allotment is meager, his fortune weak; or he has incurred old slayings, unintended harms, new grievances, or past debts. Or perhaps the qi of the five pestilences and hundred poisons, or the followers of malevolent spirits and demonic attachments, have assailed him—externally penetrating his skin and flesh, internally invading his viscera and bowels—giving rise to this grave illness, which has yet to be cured or dispelled.\n\nWe humbly beseech the Most High to bestow mercy, and the Three Luminaries to absolve his sins. May all karmic enmities be dissolved, all disasters and misfortunes harmonized and released. For sins without limit across past lives and this present existence, we now offer repentance and supplication, praying that all be forgiven and erased. May his true qi flow freely, his numinous fluids spread and moisten. May the hundred afflictions be purged, the six palaces attain peace. May his allotted blessings increase in abundance, his years extend in longevity. May his entire household enjoy fortune, and both inner and outer realms be graced with prosperity.\n\nAbove, we pray for the tranquility of the altars of soil and grain, and the eternal life of the emperor. May wind and rain be timely and harmonious, the years abundant, and the times prosperous. May all sentient beings with consciousness ascend to the realm of longevity.\n\nMay the great compassion of the Most High Heavenly Venerable shine above, and may our sincerity in prayer and repentance be met below. We reverently present this petition for your hearing.\n\n**Invocation of Intentions**\n\nFirst intention: For the Dao, the four great elements unite in virtue. May the patron’s seven generations of parents be freed from sorrow and suffering, ascend to the heavenly halls, and enjoy sustenance as natural as the Dao itself.\n\nSecond intention: For the emperor and sovereign, may the transformative power of the Dao flourish and prosper. May the schools and academies thrive, the imperial teachings expand in grandeur. May their majesty and dignity be revered by all under heaven. May the people praise the era as one of great peace, and the four barbarians submit in awe. May evil and malevolence vanish of their own accord, and worthy individuals arise daily.\n\nThird intention: For the Dharma Master, may great merit and virtue be established. May their teachings be luminous and far-reaching, and may they together attain the flight of immortals.\n\nFourth intention: For fellow aspirants and disciples, may they swiftly attain the Dao of immortality and mutually guide one another to liberation.\n\nFifth intention: For the nine relations, may harmony prevail. May they esteem benevolence and righteousness, honor the Dao and disdain wealth, and serve as models for all beings.\n\nSixth intention: For selfless giving, may offerings be made to Daoist masters and those who suffer from hunger and cold. May all people under heaven find their rightful place.\n\nSeventh intention: For all creatures that creep and crawl, may every sentient being attain fulfillment and completion.\n\nEighth intention: For the absolution of past lives’ sins and present-life karmic retributions, may merits be established to redress transgressions.\n\nNinth intention: For the prosperity of family and state, may ancestral temples be tended by worthy descendants, and generations give rise to sages and talents.\n\nTenth intention: For reverence toward the master and scriptures, may we never falter in diligence, maintaining a mind of equanimity. May all beings be broadly delivered, and may we together attain the rank of immortals, ascending to heaven in broad daylight to pay homage to the Most High. May we forever become perfected beings, riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages, harmonizing with the Dao to become true. **The incense burner is sealed.**",

Thus, the three thousand luminous realms all submit to its divine grace; the five hundred million celestial gates together attain its Dao transformation.\n\nAs fortune and misfortune alternate, and blessings and calamities shift, all may be dispelled by its sagely power, washed clean by its numinous grace.

Raising the Dharma raft to ferry across the sea of delusion, suspending the jewel to gather all beings. Proclaiming the precepts and expounding the teachings, warding off distress and aiding the imperiled.\n\nThus, we purify our thoughts and cleanse our hearts, performing the retreat and practicing the Dao. We pray that your sagely power may dispel calamities and obscurations.\n\nToday, at the noon audience, we conduct the Dao ritual. The Dharma assembly now offers the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most High and Perfected Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, reverently relying upon the Three Honored Ones of the Most High.

      "translated_text": "May this incense smoke ascend through the void, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Master-Treasures. We devote our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves with heads to the earth, reverently relying on the Three Supreme Ones. May these merits and virtues flow to the disciple So-and-so’s person. May calamities be washed away, and misfortunes be dissolved. Past grievances and old debts, through repentance and prayer, be wholly eradicated; deep-seated transgressions and hidden blemishes, through the fragrance of cultivation, be purified. May malevolent forces be stilled, and years of fortune be prolonged.\n\nFor this, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely hosts and perfected virtues of our masters. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into non-action. We harmonize with the Dao to become true.\n\nWe bow in ritual, repent, and reflect. Envisioning the nine-colored perfect image, we swallow saliva and recite the secret incantation against demons. Stepping in emptiness, we circumambulate:\n\nThe azure canopy of Primordial Qi unfurls,\nGolden incense forms pearl-like smoke.\nThe flying dawn gathers reins as one,\nBowing before the Jade Emperor’s presence.\nHis heart vast and at ease, he bestows upon us the *Tai Ling Pian*.\nThis is the indestructible Dao,\nBy which the myriad heavens uphold our authority.\nWe traverse the hollow void,\nWhile lower immortals grope in its depths.\nThe One Qi transforms the primordial origin,\nVastly preceding the Two Modes.\nPrecious ramparts race golden steeds,\nTrue incense sprays from jade lotuses.\nSoaring through space, we rein in dragon steeds,\nWhile Brahmanic chants guide the divine chariot.\nThrough endless kalpas of eternal spring,\nWe soar in the formless heavens.\nThe mysteries of the Initial Perfected are hard to fathom,\nThus we admonish the immortals within the precepts.\nThe exalted Perfected illuminate virtue and the Dao,\nBequeathing to the world the *Five Thousand Words*.\nThough our explanations are meager and shallow,\nWe exhaust our sincerity to fathom the wondrous origin.\nRainbow banners adorn the sacred canons,\nFeathered hymns resound through cloud-borne chariots.\nAuspicious cranes hover in the sky,\nPropitious winds dispel summer’s heat.\nThe vault of heaven responds to these sounds,\nBestowing a reign of countless years.\n\nWe perform the Three Bows:\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\nReaffirming our ranks, we, the humble disciples So-and-so, respectfully re-present our supplication to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Commencement; the Supreme Great Dao Lord; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; the High Ministers and Prime Aides; the Four Directors and Five Emperors; the Right and Left Perfected Ones of the Orthodox Unity; the Supreme Perfected Purple Void Primordial Lady of the Southern Peak; and all the divine officials and hosts of the Three Realms.\n\nWe humbly recall: when the Heavenly Origin established the supreme pole and the Earthly Principle marked the pivot, riding the wondrous Dao to differentiate forms and fixing the Two Modes to set forth images, their vast embrace knew no bounds, their sheltering power was inexhaustible. Yet the cycles of nine and six bring changes of ascent and descent; the alternations of decline and prosperity mark the passage of kalpas. How much more so for human kind—how could they be free from decline and decay?\n\nDisciple So-and-so, dwelling in the worldly net and stained by the dusty realm, is constrained by qi and phenomena, struck by fortune and misfortune. Thus, he is entangled in illness and misfortune, ever more deeply beset by worry and peril. We fear that in past lives and this existence, karmic blemishes remain unwashed, old grievances and accumulated transgressions, debts and disputes, are yet unresolved. Perhaps through intentional killing or accidental harm, he has incurred misfortune and blame. Or through the stars and his natal destiny, he has suffered evil and calamity. His form and fate are humble and fragile—there is nowhere to turn for repentance and prayer.\n\nTherefore, we lay bare our hearts to the Great Dao, prostrating ourselves before the Mystic Code. We establish the altar and humbly offer repentance and gratitude. Following the rank and protocol of the Heavenly Master, we initiate the first ritual document. In accordance with the Purple Void Primordial Lady’s method of repentance for calamities, we now petition on behalf of So-and-so:\n\nWe summon the Heavenly Prosperity Lord and one hundred thousand Yellow-Clad Soldiers to gather and remove all inauspicious influences, the twelve criminal and deadly qi, from within and without the disciple’s household.\n\nWe further summon the Southern Palace Heavenly Bright Lord and the Northern Star Six Mechanisms Lord to collect the five pestilences, hundred poisons, and hundred illnesses.\n\nWe summon the Feng-Li Lord and the Red Plain Lord to eliminate the disciple’s ailments of the heart, abdomen, and urinary obstructions.\n\nWe summon the Heavenly Official Five Balances Lord, the Earthly Official Five Balances Lord, the Nine Rivers Northern Sea Lord, the Kingly Law Lord, the Nine Assemblies Lord, the Great Official Yang Order Lord, the Southern Superior Lord, the Momentary Lord, and the Stone Immortal Lord to expel all inner and outer demonic afflictions causing illness.\n\nWe summon the Heaven-Covering Great General and the Upper Prime Officer Lord to capture and subdue all malevolent deceased spirits, averting misfortune and inviting blessings.\n\nWe summon the Earth-Restraining Lord and the Four Hu Lords to dispel the calamities of the disciple’s current year and natal destiny, severing the qi of deceased spirits’ influences.\n\nWe summon the Qi-Moving Calamity-Dissolving Lord, the Supreme High Granary Lord, the Supreme Heavenly Lord, and the Level Heaven Lord to dissolve and remove the ghosts of death, mourning, punishment, harm, and the five graves.\n\nWe summon the Numinous Plain Heavenly Essence Lord, the Red Heaven Qi-Consuming Lord, and the Spirit-Gathering Upper Bright Lord to sever the disciple’s nightmares, malevolent ghosts, and the qi of lingering illnesses.\n\nMay the twenty-four divisions of heavenly officials and soldiers descend in timely fashion to punish evil, extinguish malevolence, and subdue inauspicious influences. May true qi secretly aid him, granting peace and well-being. May his dreams and waking be upright, his lifespan prolonged. May his nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and his six relations receive blessings. May dragon spirits guard and protect him, his dwelling secure and tranquil.\n\nAbove, we pray that the imperial Dao shines resplendently, the Heavenly Origin be bright and serene. May weapons of war be forever stilled, wind and rain arrive in due season. May grain and crops be abundant, the hidden and manifest realms harmonious. May all beings be universally included, even those in the darkest chambers. May all together bathe in the profound grace and together attain the realm of blessings. May the luminous Heavenly Worthy’s vast compassion respond to our humble repentance and supplication.\n\nWe respectfully present this entreaty.\n\nWe now make our vows:\n\nFirst, may the Great Dao be serene and empty, tranquil and still, dwelling in clarity and purity. May it widely open the gates of the Dharma, instructing the stubborn and foolish. May all receive its beneficent grace and cultivate with diligence. May we, together with our fellow students, universally ascend to the void, preserving our union with heaven, abiding forever without care.\n\nSecond, may the myriad heavens condense their qi and become clear. May the high void broadly shelter, preserving the true and securing the numinous. May the climate be harmonious, the four seasons balanced. May the nation be secure, the people prosperous, and all under heaven be at peace. May all beings be universally aided, and its beneficence extend to all life. May the heavens be preserved for countless kalpas, never to collapse.\n\nThird, may the earth bear and sustain without end.",

As they emerge, let them solemnly prepare and open the gates of the Mysterious Altar to the Heavenly Thearch and Divine Lords, and summon the local earth gods and territorial true officials. This servant now, acting on behalf of the intent herein, prays that the wondrous light of the Jade Purity Dao Qi and Numinous Treasure may descend and flow into the bodies of this servant and company, thereby rendering the Mysterious Altar pure and transforming both inner and outer into truth. Let the heavens be free of defilement, the earth purged of demonic dust. Let the chiming of jade resound, the ten directions grow solemn and clear. Let the myriad demons not intrude, true sincerity ascend above. May the words this servant utters swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme, Boundless, Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Golden Gate Jade Steps of the Great Dao.\n\nEach declares their dharma rank:\nIn reverent unity, we, your servants, humbly address the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Boundless Great Dao Supreme Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Jade Thearch of the August Heaven, the Great Sage Hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Void Thearch, the Great Thearch of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Gate, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Terrace, Purple Tenuity, Upper Palace, Numinous Treasure, Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, and all the true numina of the Three Realms.\n\nWe, your servants, have heard that the undifferentiated gives rise to form, the True One congeals into light. Heaven and earth rely upon it for their inception, yin and yang operate through it for generation and transformation. Flourishing and decline alternate, good and evil intertwine. The sun and moon have their times of waning and decline, cold and heat have their cycles of advance and retreat. Only this Great Dao pervades the hidden and manifest. It extends blessings and bestows grace, broadly aiding all existence. We, your servants, early explored the true instructions and obtained a glimpse of the numinous charts. The Three Caverns’ jade cases contain rites of prayer and exorcism; the Nine Heavens’ golden tablets transmit texts of salvation and protection. For forty thousand kalpas they have been expounded, by five hundred million heavens they are revered. They subdue demonic evil and summon demonic spirits. They assist the state in establishing merit, deliver beings and save things. When there is something to be prayed for, how dare we not make it known above?\n\nRecitation of the Petition:\nFollowing the words of the petition, we are truly sincere and earnest. Disciple So-and-so, with disasters yet unceased and illnesses yet unalleviated, surrenders his life to the various heavens and lays bare his heart to the Great Dao. He requests to perform the fast and vigil, to invite the descent of numinous power. Thus, with cinnabar sincerity, he together hopes for mysterious protection. Tonight, during the evening audience and circumambulation, the Dharma assembly is entreated to offer the first pinch of incense. May the smoke of this incense ascend directly to offer reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe, your servants, surrender our bodies and lives, prostrate ourselves, and look up in reliance upon the Three Worthies of the Supreme. May the merit of this act flow to the Emperor and the august personages of the nine ancestral temples. May they ascend in splendor to the Three Purities, bestowing auspiciousness upon the myriad states. May the great foundation be firmly established, the phoenix calendar eternally flourishing. May the Crown Prince and various princes steadfastly support the great enterprise. May the empresses, consorts, and all officials assist in the sagely plans. May the tracks of carts be as one, the ladders and ships all gather. For this reason, we now burn incense and personally take refuge in the Great Sage Hosts, the Perfected and Virtuous Ones. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into non-action, harmonizing and uniting with the Dao as truth.\n\nTonight, during the evening audience and circumambulation, the Dharma assembly is entreated to offer the second pinch of incense. May the smoke of this incense ascend directly to offer reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.\n\nWe, your servants, surrender our bodies and lives, prostrate ourselves, and look up in reliance upon the Three Worthies of the Supreme. May the merit of this act flow to the patron of this fast, the household of So-and-so. May the nine ancestors and seven generations, the obscured and lingering spirits, transcend the earthly dust and ascend to the celestial thoroughfares. May litigation be stilled at the gates of darkness, blessings and auspiciousness flow to future descendants. May the Nine Yous and earthly prisons all behold the light of compassion. May the beings of the six destinies together ascend to the realm of goodness. For this reason, we now burn incense and personally take refuge in the Great Sage Hosts, the Perfected and Virtuous Ones. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into non-action, harmonizing and uniting with the Dao as truth.\n\nTonight, during the evening audience and circumambulation, the Dharma assembly is entreated to offer the third pinch of incense. May the smoke of this incense ascend directly to offer reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters.\n\nWe, your servants, surrender our bodies and lives, prostrate ourselves, and look up in reliance upon the Three Worthies of the Supreme. May the merit of this act flow to disciple So-and-so’s person. May karmic debts be pacified, disasters and calamities dissolved. May inauspicious declines melt like ice, illnesses and misfortunes disperse like clouds. May the Southern Dipper extend life, the Eastern Palace register blessings.

      "translated_text": "Now, therefore, we kindle incense and surrender ourselves in refuge to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters, whose virtue is most true. Having attained the Dao, they ascend into the realm of non-action, harmonizing with the Dao to merge with the Real.\n\nWe bow in the four directions, repent, and pace the void. As we circumambulate, our steps trace the celestial net; the heavenly winds blow swiftly upon us. Our fluttering robes rise to the handle of the Dipper, while we hold the fly-whisk and bow to the Banner of the Three Stars. Lions bear vermilion tassels, and qilins lead jade-green chariots. Flying through the eight extremities, how often have we seen the spring branches burst forth? Verdant temples crown crimson headbands, and azure mists entwine our feathered robes. At dawn we hasten to the Hall of Solar Virtue; by night we arrive at the Gate of Lunar Splendor. We strike and play with the fires of the celestial sphere, and the soaking rains awaken the earth’s mechanisms. The Jade Chamber cannot retain us—we soar instead toward the ninefold heavens.\n\nOnce, in the Hall of Extended Grace, at midnight, the Nine August Ones descended. The Six Perfected divided left and right, while yellow mists coiled around the balustrades. Within the vast palace, the divine lords were revered, and celestial soldiers guarded the Dao sanctuary. Today, as filial descendants, we continue this resolve, standing but a foot’s span from the numinous radiance.\n\nWith threefold prostration, we, your servants, bow our heads in utmost sincerity to the Supreme, Boundless Dao of the Great Ultimate.\nWe, your servants, bow our heads in utmost sincerity to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, bow our heads in utmost sincerity to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\nReverently addressing the ranks of the Dharma, we, your servants, So-and-so and others, humbly reaffirm our supplication to the Supreme, Boundless Dao of the Great Ultimate, the Primordial Celestial Venerable of the Origin; the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Venerable Perfected of the Ten Directions’ Boundless Dao and Virtue; the Celestial Thearchs and Great Emperors; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm; the High Ministers and Prime Ministers; the Four Directors and Five Emperors; and all the divine officials and numinous spirits of the Three Realms.\n\nWe bear the precious script upon our persons, ever ashamed of the divine grace bestowed. Privately delving into the profound mysteries, our aspiration lies in spreading the light of yang. We seek to establish merit through transformation, broadly benefiting all beings. Disciple So-and-so, beset by inauspicious fate and afflicted by illness, presents this petition with utmost sincerity, praying for blessings. We request the elevation of this fast and the invocation of the true numina. Thus, we respectfully follow the canonical rites, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao.\n\nFirst, we repent for disciple So-and-so’s transgressions, both past and present, which are deep and grievous. Some offend the benevolence of heaven and earth’s nurturing embrace; others betray the virtue of the sun and moon’s illumination. We have violated the nature of the two qi and five phases, harmed the harmony of the three luminaries and six regulations. Unresolved karmic debts from the past compound with newly accrued sins. We have caused harm through error and killing, indulging our wills and following our hearts. Ignorant of causes and conditions, heedless of prohibitions and taboos, moved by the six emotions, and acting through the three karmas, we have transgressed against the unseen and the manifest, contravened the teachings of the scriptures. Thus, we incur these retributions and construct these calamities.\n\nWe further fear having offended the dragon spirits by initiating construction on earth and wood, violating geomantic principles and contravening celestial timing. We dread the influences of the stellar lodges and the afflictions of yearly cycles, the clashes of the Nine Palaces and the conflicts of the Eight Trigrams. Obstruction runs deep, and our anxieties are acute. Therefore, we now perform this fast and practice the Dao, repenting for our transgressions. We kindle incense, recite scriptures, and pray to heaven to petition for life. May all calamities, sins, and faults be repented and eradicated. May the Great Unity extend life, and the Three Primes avert death. May the Jade Lads dispense medicine, and the Five Emperors bestow talismans. May the six viscera be harmonized, and the hundred passages flow freely. May longevity be prolonged and emolument endure, misfortune vanish and fortune arise.\n\nWe further pray that the nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and the six relations receive protection. May those who soar and those who sink fulfill their natures, and all beings, moving and still, be secure. Above, we wish for the imperial enterprise to flourish, heaven to endure and earth to last. May martial prowess be stilled, and civil virtue be consummated. May the sun’s wisdom shine doubly bright, and rivers float with sagely grace. May linked pearls and conjoined jades once more be seen in the dark heavens; may the Eight Trigrams and Nine Categories be re-revealed in the limpid Luo. May the three agricultural seasons proceed in order, and the nine grains know no fault. May drought and flood not arise, and pestilence not occur. May weapons be forever sheathed, and wind and rain come in due season.\n\nExtending to the hidden paths, may all sentient beings be universally included. May the ministers of yin and yang, the officials of mountains and rivers, propagate the Dao and pacify the people, punish the perverse and protect the upright. May all ascend the shore of fortune and together attain the stages of the Dao.\n\nMay the vast compassion of the Heavenly Venerable above be manifest, and may the sincere devotion of your servants below be answered.\n\nWe make our vows:\nFirst, may heaven and earth be bright and pure.\nSecond, may the atmosphere be clear and mysterious.\nThird, may the sage live ten thousand years.\nFourth, may transformation reach the eight boundaries.\nFifth, may heaven bestow sweet dew.\nSixth, may earth emit auspicious mists.\nSeventh, may the four seasons follow their course.\nEighth, may the myriad things be born whole.\nNinth, may families abound in filial piety and fraternal duty.\nTenth, may the state teem with talent and worthies.\nEleventh, may the officiants of this rite obtain blessings.\nTwelfth, may those who study the Dao attain immortality.\n\nWe replenish the incense burner. May the Incense Officials, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and the various spirit officials of the incense attend to where we present this incense, naturally generating golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred numinous perfected gather here before the incense burner. May we who study the Dao attain the Dao, and those who seek immortality attain immortality.

      "translated_text": "Each visualizes the nine-hued perfect image, swallows saliva, and recites the secret demon-commanding incantation. Treading the void in dance, circling in reverence, they prostrate to the Supreme, burn incense, and return to the formless. Radiant light follows their turn, and the Dharma-wheel likewise completes three revolutions. Mystic vows arise in the four quarters, and numinous blessings extend to kings and lords. Seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, their splendor spreading in glorious display. Their songs resound beyond the vast desert, and celestial music delights their joy. Together they offer fragrant virtue to the Supreme, with whom even the lower immortals cannot compare. Wondrous thoughts illumine dark enlightenment, and in throngs they ride the void in wandering. Circling, they tread the cloud-net, mounting the void to walk the dark principle. Chanting the hymns of the Lord of Unity, a hundred channels naturally harmonize. Below, they command the lads of the eight seas; above, they escort the lofty immortals. The hosts of heaven scatter flowers of incense, and a serene numinous wind arises. Long-held vows fix the root of destiny, thus attaining the highest eminence. Rejoicing before the Supreme, even ten thousand kalpas would not mark its beginning. Towering is the Dark Capital Mountain, where the ten directions revere the August One. Lofty is the Heavenly Treasure Terrace, its radiance streaming like the sun’s flame. Resplendent are the jade-forest blossoms, their crimson fruits gleaming bright. Ever mindful to feast on primordial essence, refining the fluids to secure bodily form. Golden light scatters through the Purple Tenuity, profound and serene, the Great Vehicle glides free.\n\n**Three Bows**\nWe, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity to the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao.\nWe, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity to the thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, prostrate with utmost sincerity to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\n**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**\nWe, your humble servants, such-and-such and others, now respectfully reaffirm our address to the Supreme, Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Celestial Worthy, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm, the Three Master Lords, the High Ministers and High Chancellors, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, and all the divine officials of the Three Realms.\n\nWe, your servants, dust-bound and of humble merit, have accumulated good fortune over lifetimes to encounter this assembly. The mystic wind spreads universally, and the true teaching is proclaimed afar. Precious talismans and jade-scriptures descend from the Three Clarities to unfold transformation; dragon-writ and phoenix-edicts encompass the myriad sages in transmitting truth. Reverently receiving the guidance of our masters, we have all been graced with their instruction. Yet we have not been able to cultivate diligently nor preserve our ascent to flight. Only by establishing merit, delivering people, and aiding beings can we repay the virtue of the Perfect Dao in shaping all things and requite the benevolence of heaven and earth in covering and supporting all. Whatever beings turn their hearts toward it should be duly reported.\n\nThe patron of this retreat, such-and-such, has learned that the Three Primes possess their ranks, and the Supreme Sages have bequeathed their texts. This is the season when the Celestial Prime renews its mandate, the day when the Three Palaces of the Emperor issue their amnesty. Both the hidden and the manifest receive protection, and all that moves or grows is touched by grace. Privately reflecting that to repay one’s lord and parents, nothing precedes the building of blessings; to serve one’s family and country, nothing surpasses the merit of this retreat. Thus we prostrate at the numinous altar, turning our hearts to the Supreme Sages. Bearing the tokens of the Dharma, we have reverently established this ritual precinct. Jade pendants and pearl banners mingle with sacred regalia in dazzling splendor; whale-bell and phoenix-chime lead the immortal chants in ethereal measure. The Perfected and Sages draw near from afar, and our sincerity is lifted upward. We humbly pray that the great treasure of your numinous influence may bless and protect the imperial enterprise. May the phoenix calendar be subtly extended, and the dragon majesty firmly secured. May the emperor’s sagacity surpass that of Fuxi and Huangdi, his benevolence equal that of Yao and Shun. May the myriad dwellings rest in harmony, and the nine regions submit to transformation. May the three frontiers be pacified, forever free from the toil of beacon fires; may the eight extremities shine in clarity, ever open to tribute from afar. May the imperial enterprise of Great Peace outshine all rivals. May the stars follow their courses in the nine heavens, and wind and rain be balanced through the four seasons. May weapons, disease, and epidemics not afflict the common people; may floods, droughts, fires, and locusts not arise within the kingdom’s borders.\n\nNext, we pray for the household of the patron of this retreat: may the nine lineages be delivered, and the five clans live in harmony. May their name be inscribed in the south for accumulated goodness, and their record of transgressions erased in the northern bureau. May calamities not arise, and blessings be ever renewed. May their official emoluments be increased in the heavenly palace, and their lifespan extended in the immortal precincts. Thereafter, may the frozen courts of the long night and the riverine realms of Fengdu be transformed. May dark prisons become pure and tranquil abodes, and hells be converted into realms of formlessness. May all beings fulfill their natures, and every kind awaken. May heaven endure and earth abide, ever advancing in the Dao’s transformation. Above, may the radiant grace of the Heavenly Worthy of Vast Salvation be manifest; below, may the sincerity of we, your servants, in turning toward the Dao be answered.\n\nRespectfully we make this address known.\n\n**Initiating the Vows**\nFirst vow: for the four great elements of the Dao to unite in virtue with the patron of this retreat. May the seven generations of parents escape suffering and sorrow, ascend to heaven, and enjoy natural sustenance.\n\nSecond vow: for the emperor and lords of the realm, that the Dao’s transformation flourish. May schools and academies thrive, and the imperial teaching expand. May their majesty and decorum be revered, and all under heaven look upon them. May the people praise Great Peace, and the four barbarians submit. May evil and perversity vanish of themselves, and sages and worthies arise naturally.\n\nThird vow: for the Dharma Master, that great merit be established. May their teaching and transformation be clear and far-reaching, and all attain flight as immortals.\n\nFourth vow: for fellow students of the Dao. May they swiftly attain the immortal way and mutually aid one another in deliverance.\n\nFifth vow: for the nine relations to live in harmony, esteeming benevolence and righteousness. May they value the Dao and scorn wealth, their conduct a model for all beings.\n\nSixth vow: to diminish oneself and bestow alms upon Daoist masters and those who suffer hunger and cold. May all people under heaven find their proper place.\n\nSeventh vow: for creeping and crawling beings. May all sentient beings equally achieve fulfillment.\n\nEighth vow: to pardon past transgressions. May the sins of this life be redressed by establishing merit to compensate for faults.\n\nNinth vow: for the flourishing of the household. May the ancestral temple have descendants, and worthy talent arise in every generation.\n\nTenth vow: to honor and receive the scripture masters, never daring to grow remiss, but maintaining a single, equal mind. May all beings be broadly delivered, and all attain the rank of immortal. May they ascend to heaven in broad daylight, pay homage to the Supreme, and forever become Perfected Ones, riding cloud chariots and feathered carriages. Harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.\n\nThe incense is replenished.",

Truly, we should lift our traces to the cloudy groves, nest our spirits in the tranquil vastness, shake our robes free of the vulgar, and pursue friendship with the highest Perfected. Yet the Great Sages have bestowed their regulations, and the Primordial August One has spread the teachings. First, we must aid the state and proclaim transformation, succoring beings and pacifying the people, propagating the Dao and establishing merit, broadly covering all kinds. For every prayer and supplication, how dare we not report it above?\n\n*Reading the petition*\nAccording to the words of the petition, it is fitting to submit this report.\nThe retreat master, [name], above reveres the ancestral temples, below extends to all beings. Hoping to establish good merit and broadly propagate excellent blessings, especially as this is the auspicious season of the [specific] Primordial Festival, a day of purification and retreat. The Jade Emperor presides above, and the ten thousand sages review merit in the Three Realms. The living and the dead share in blessings, not a hair’s breadth omitted. Thus, we perform this rite of prayer and supplication to express the sincerity of human servants. Holding the Dharma tokens, we have reverently established the altar. We, your servants, relying on the canonical rites, concentrate our spirits and purify our thoughts, directing our hearts to the Crimson Palace and bowing our hands to the Pure Capital. We hope that feathered canopies and cloud chariots will descend in semblance, that the highest Perfected and august Sages will vaguely manifest their presence, bestowing blessings across seas and mountains, encompassing the hidden and the manifest with their protection.\n\nToday, at the noon audience, we, the Dharma assembly, perform the first offering of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao. We, your servants, surrender our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves, looking up to the Three Supreme Ones of the Most High. May this merit, above, benefit the sacred spirits of the altars of soil and grain and the ancestral temples, causing them to ascend to the Azure Heavens and bestow blessings upon the imperial domain.\n\nMay the Emperor’s virtue equal that of Fuxi and Shennong, his merit match that of the Yellow Emperor and Emperor Yan. May the mountain of his longevity grow ever higher, the sun of his sagacity shine ever brighter. May the tracks of chariots unite, weapons be stilled, the stars and planets move in harmony, wind and rain come in season. May the Crown Prince and the various kings inherit the celestial mandate and continue the sagely line. May the Empress, consorts, princesses, the hundred officials, and all ministers daily receive new blessings, their illustrious glory flourishing.

      "translated_text": "Each visualizes the nine-colored spherical image, swallows saliva, and recites the secret incantation to command demons. Stepping in the void, circling in procession, bowing and rising while contemplating the Most High, the radiant splendor flourishes in the cinnabar field. Glancing left, one uplifts the somber essence; gazing right, one grasps the resplendent brilliance. The Six Perfections crown the pure conduct, and virtue and the Dao renew with each dawn. Accumulated blessings from past lives respond, and hearing the scriptures feels as intimate as kin. Heaven-endowed with transcendent talent, joyfully reciting the subtle and profound texts, one breathes the qi of supreme harmony, exhaling and inhaling the essence of flowing clouds. Embryonic breathing stills the hundred passages, and in profound emptiness, one masters the three conveniences. The Niwan Palace shines with luminous splendor, and thus one becomes an immortal of golden radiance. The Demon Kings respectfully receive their charge, enabling ascent to the heavens. All begins with fasting and precepts, accumulating merit to bind past-life affinities. Soaring through the great void, one uplifts the loftiest beings, guiding the reins to traverse the ten directions, resting upon the slopes of the darkly radiant peaks. Gazing up at the Terrace of Kalpas, looking down upon the purple cloud net, one roams the Most High’s capital, sitting together upon lotus blossoms. Through accumulated study, one becomes a Perfected Person, serene and harmonious in vital essence. Endlessly enjoying boundless longevity, why count the myriad cedars? The great Dao’s master is profound stillness, and the immortal companion is the peerless hero. The noble scion bestows the spirit talisman, while the Great One bears the cavernous scriptures. The relics gleam with golden form, and the dragon chariot swiftly arrives to welcome. The Heavenly Worthy gazes upon the cloud carriage, soaring lightly through the void. Fragrant blossoms fall like snow, and misty vapors flourish upon the darkly radiant beams.\n\n**Three Bows**\nWe, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Most High Boundless Great Dao.\nWe, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.\n\n**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**\nWe, your humble servants, so-and-so and others, respectfully reaffirm and address the Most High Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Supreme Mysterious Ancient; the Perfect, Boundless Great Dao and the Host of Sagely Worthies; the Heavenly Worthies and Perfected Ones; the Great Emperors and Heavenly Thearchs; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the Three Masters; the High Ministers and Prime Ministers; the Four Directors and Five Emperors; and all the divine officials and true spirits of the Three Realms.\n\nWe reflect upon our lowly and humble station, yet bathed in the mysterious wind of the Dao. Elevated in the ranks of the Dao, our names are listed among the true teachings. We have glimpsed the profundities of the Three Caverns and Five Scriptures, perused the dragon-bound and phoenix-scribed texts. Yet we have not hidden our traces or concealed our names in secluded forests and remote valleys, aspiring to ascension and eternal adherence to the numinous regulations. At the outset of receiving the Dharma, we made a pact with the Three Officials: our duty is first to succor beings, assisting the state and transforming the times. Establishing the teachings and accomplishing merit, we exhaust our sincerity and integrity.\n\nNow, the ritual sponsor so-and-so petitions with earnest devotion, for the state and for the people, offering heartfelt loyalty and presenting incense and flowers as tokens of faith. We request the exalted fast and Dharma to repay the sovereign and parents. Moreover, the Three Primes are the season of great amnesty, when the living and the dead receive blessings; the Three Radiances mark the days of great illumination, when the hidden and the manifest are enlightened. In the Upper Palace of the Dark Capital, the Golden Gates of the Purple Tenuity, the myriad heavens hold their courtly feasts, and the host of sages turn their chariots. Absolving transgressions and elevating merit are fitting for this auspicious occasion. Dispelling calamities and invoking blessings, we pray for flourishing times.\n\nWe, in accordance with the canonical statutes, reverently perform the fast and vigil. Establishing the altar and practicing the Dao, we model earth after heaven. Burning incense and lighting lamps, we illuminate the dark night. The fragrant smoke ascends to the heavens, awaiting the true sages’ distant descent. May our sincerity reach them, and may we receive their abundant grace.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Three Clarities’ sagely worthies and the eight poles’ lofty venerables deign to lend their majestic radiance, bringing peace to the state’s fortunes. May they secure and pacify the altars of soil and grain, purifying and ordering the realm. May the emperor’s dual brilliances shine equally, his longevity matching the mountains. May he dredge the vast sources without end, bearing the vermilion screen with effortless governance. May the eight seas and nine continents see the cessation of weapons, and the three frontiers and six directions know no alarm from blades or arrows. May he rival the Three and Five in eminence, surpassing the sagacity of Fuxi and Shennong. May the winds of the Winnowing Basket and rains of the Net bring harmony, ensuring abundant harvests; may the sun of Shun and clouds of Yao shine resplendently, bringing peace to the myriad regions. May the crown prince embody the image of brightness and separation, and the various princes stand firm as bedrock. Within the six palaces, virtue is surely cultivated; among the hundred ministers, loyal counsel is clearly manifest. Climbing mountains and crossing seas, all follow the sagacious decrees. From distant lands and foreign domains, all converge under the Dao’s transformation. May the frontiers be tranquil and orderly, and near and far rejoice in well-being. May pestilence not arise, and calamitous omens vanish of themselves.\n\nThen, may the long-night abodes of the Nine Darks and the realms of the Three Paths and Six Destinies see the deliverance of the nine generations of ancestors and the three masters. May the ritual sponsor so-and-so’s accumulated transgressions from past lives be cleansed and dissolved through repentance; may the thousand disasters and myriad afflictions be washed away by the true spirits. Renewed in fortune and lifespan, may they eternally enjoy benefit and integrity. May their inner and outer kin all attain supreme auspiciousness. May those who soar and those who sink fulfill their natures, and may all creatures be secure. Within heaven and earth, may no being lose its place. May the Heavenly Worthy’s vast compassion above respond to our devoted sincerity below.\n\n**Petitions**\nFirst, we pray that the Great Dao remain serene and empty, tranquil and still, dwelling in clarity. May it widely open the Dharma gates, instructing the stubborn and ignorant. May all receive its beneficent grace, cultivating diligently and austerely. May we, together with our fellow students, universally ascend to the void, preserving ourselves with heaven and abiding forever without care.\n\nSecond, we pray that the various heavens condense their qi and clarify their essence, vast and lofty in their coverage, preserving the true and securing the numinous. May the climate be harmonious, the four seasons balanced. May the state be secure and the people prosperous, the world at peace. May all be broadly succored, and beneficence reach all beings. May heaven be preserved eternally, enduring for countless kalpas without collapse.\n\nThird, we pray that the earth endure in its covering and bearing without end, stable and unshaken, the seas not engulfing or collapsing. May it secure and protect the state and families, and the multitudes of people flourish. May it nurture the living and pacify the dead, its beneficence encompassing the ten directions. May crops and plants flourish, and enterprises daily prosper. May all receive its abundant support, and the myriad things follow accordingly.\n\nFourth, we pray that the sun and moon, the two luminaries, shine brightly, without eclipses or disturbances, their waxing and waning serene and clear. May their light illuminate the heavens, dispelling all darkness. May they safeguard the kalpas and ensure peaceful reigns. May they universally bestow moisture and grace, showering blessings upon all beings.",

May the five grains ripen in abundance, the state prosper, and the people rejoice.\n\nSeventh, we pray that floating clouds gather qi and amass mist. Soaring high and clear in the heavens, may they shade and cover the profound and mysterious. When concealed, they remain in non-action; when dispersed, they fill the sky.

May the four frontiers be peaceful and harmonious, weapons and warfare unraised. May heaven and humanity sing in praise, auspicious omens descending in flight. May teachings be disseminated with solemnity, and virtuous transformation spread far and wide. May the multitudes rejoice in celebration, their joy unending.\n\nTwelfth, we pray that all creatures—those that soar, crawl, or stir, whether born or yet unborn—may universally receive safety and security, attaining life and growth. May they all behold the primordial qi, receiving the forms of yang. May grasses, trees, fruits, and forests endure winter without withering. May all be delivered and uplifted, none that do not flourish in fresh splendor. May harmony unite with the Dao in truth, returning to the crucible.",

Its divine transformations greatly flourish, universally delivering the multitudes. Thus, the officials of heaven, earth, and water oversee the clarity of transgressions and blessings; the clerks of yin and yang assess fortune and misfortune. The flying celestials recite the jade-casket texts, while the highest sages request the jade-case registers. From families to states, all are permitted to repent and pray.

      "translated_text": "By grace of our masters’ guidance, we bear the secret registers of the Three Clarities; through reverent reception of the Mystic Decree, we chant the true scriptures of the Three Caverns. Ranked among the immortal orders, our names ascend the jade tablets. Yet we have not yet refined spirit and burnished bone, nor severed traces to attain the empty breast. In vain do we abide at the Gate of All Wonders, often transgressing the statutes of the Luminous Perfected. Formerly, on the day we received the Dharma, we pledged alliance to the Five Emperors and swore oaths to the Three Officials—to deliver and uplift heaven and humanity, to aid and assist family and state. Whatever prayers are offered, by principle they must be declared. Today, our earnest sincerity is too profound to suppress. Having received the petition’s intent, how dare we not report it above?\n\n**Reading the Petition**\nAs the petition humbly states, its principles succor the hidden and the manifest. The patron of this retreat, through kalpas of accumulated merit and virtues surpassing all heavens, reveres the great transformation of the spontaneous and worships the Primordial Honored One of the Boundless. They assist the state and guide the sovereign, cherishing kin and serving elders. Embracing the profound intent of deliverance and uplift, they pity the sunken souls of the hidden depths. Moved by compassion, their hearts grieve and their aspirations pour forth. Following the sagely teachings, they repay great kindness. Unfolding the canons of the Yellow Register, they open the ranks of the Mystic Altar. With solemn adornment and reverent offerings of incense and flowers, they invoke the spirits of the Three Officials and Five Emperors, and pay homage to the sages of the Golden Portal and Jade Chambers.\n\nWe, in accordance with the scriptures and in observance of the precepts, purify our thoughts and concentrate our spirits, cleansing our minds and fixing our devotion. Today, at the noon audience as we perform the Dao, the assembly of Dharma-pleaders raises the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High and Perfectly True Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Supreme. May these merits, above, benefit the ancestral temples and imperial altars of the august house, their numinous might harmonizing with the effortless and their achievements manifesting in perfect fulfillment. May the dragon’s chart of the emperor endure forever, the phoenix’s reign flourish evermore. May the realm be unified in culture and governance, harmonious as seas and mountains. May the myriad people rely on this, all affairs be upright. May virtuous transformation shine forth, generations flourish abundantly. May the ten thousand regions be tranquil, the nine luminaries radiant and exalted.\n\nThose who withdraw to cultivate perfection, their teachers and parents, all may roam the eight poles and swiftly ascend the Three Clarities. For this reason, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely assembly of the Perfected, whose virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless.\n\nToday, at the noon audience as we perform the Dao, the assembly of Dharma-pleaders raises the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High and Perfectly True Treasure of the Scriptures.\n\nWe surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Supreme. May these merits confer blessings upon the patron of this retreat. May the ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears, the departed spirits, have their names stricken from the registers of doom and their merits inscribed in the tablets of record. May they ascend as perfected beings to serene realms, their blessings flowing to descendants. Abiding long in the steadfastness of the One, may their names be exalted in posterity; eternally cherishing the Three Treasures, may their teachings be handed down to future generations.\n\nFor this reason, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely assembly of the Perfected, whose virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless, harmonizing with the true Dao.\n\nToday, at the noon audience as we perform the Dao, the assembly of Dharma-pleaders raises the third pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High and Perfectly True Treasure of the Masters.\n\nWe surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying on the Three Honored Ones of the Supreme. May these merits extend grace to all beings, bestowing blessings upon the myriad people. May all attain fulfillment in life and growth, each equally sharing in benefit and relief. Extending to the drifting souls of travelers and the wandering spirits of the waves—those who have suffered the deep calamities of the eight difficulties and escaped the extreme torments of the nine dark realms—may their names, not yet erased from the black registers nor recorded in the cinnabar books, all receive the compassionate favor of the Honored Ones. Command the Heavenly Officials to record them in full, instruct the Earth Prisons to gather them completely. May they all come to the altar feast and partake in deliverance and salvation. May they forever depart from evil destinies, all plant the roots of goodness. Sheltered in the heavens and among humanity, may they be reborn in bliss.\n\nFor this reason, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the great sagely assembly of the Perfected. Their virtue, having attained the Dao, ascends into the formless, harmonizing with the true Dao.\n\n**Repentance**\nThreefold Invocation.",

vastness of the Great Vehicle.\nBy the heart’s intent, the field of blessings is established,\nAnd the Wheel of Dharma rises in boundless ascent.\nMay the seven ancestors ascend to the heavenly halls,\nWhile my own form soars in the light of day.\n\n**Threefold Prostration**\nWe, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,\nTo the Supreme Primordial Dao of the Utmost Pole.\nWe, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,\nTo the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWe, your servants, with utmost sincerity bow our heads in reverence,\nTo the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\n**Reaffirming the Dharma Ranks**\nWe, the disciples of the Upper Clarity and Mystic Capital, the Masters of [such-and-such] Peak, once more invoke:\nThe Supreme Primordial Dao of the Limitless, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning;\nThe Supreme Lord of the Great Dao;\nThe Supreme Lord Lao;\nThe Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures;\nThe Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm;\nAnd all the perfected and numinous beings within and beyond the Three Realms, in the sacred mountains and grotto-heavens.\n\nWe, your servants, have heard that the Supreme Mystery acts,\nReceiving the non-acting to become acting;\nThe Most Sagely is without partiality,\nGiving life to beings yet remaining without attachment.\nIt nurtures and shapes all things,\nHalting poison and fostering growth.\nIts use is inexhaustible, its divine power ungoverned.\nIt proclaims the work of vast opening,\nAnd magnifies the gate of deliverance and salvation.\nThe net is cast wide, its great trust silent and profound.\n\nNow, the master of this fast, [so-and-so], perceiving the subtle and pondering the distant,\nKnocks upon the silent to seek the mysterious, spanning kalpas before Heaven.\nThe ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears,\nTheir forms dispersed and qi scattered,\nHave left residual karmic afflictions,\nExtending even to his own person.\nReaching to kin and dependents,\nThey cycle through birth and death,\nCreating transgressions and faults.\nLooking up, he relies on the texts of repentance and cleansing,\nHoping for the favor of purification and absolution.\nAdmiring the principle of deliverance by the Mystic Venerable,\nHe solemnly observes the rites with reverence;\nFollowing the statutes of salvation by the Supreme Sages,\nHe strictly upholds the fast and precepts.\nWith golden dragon talismans and offerings of faith,\nHe approaches the sacred thrones to pay homage to the Perfected.\nReciting the numinous scriptures, he devoutly prays for the sages’ protection.\n\nFurther considering the officiants of this fast,\nWho hold positions of governance and oversee regions,\nThe weal and woe of the people rest upon them,\nAnd the creation of blessings depends entirely on their prayers and supplications.\nWeary from the toils of the rite, their myriad concerns,\nThey bind their hearts in earnest devotion.\nThey think of the meritorious and worthy,\nExtending to the masses.\nSome established merit in service to the state,\nPerishing in royal affairs;\nSome, facing peril, forgot their families,\nDying in foreign lands far from home;\nSome, as merchants or traders, amassed wealth at the cost of their lives;\nSome, as officials, compromised integrity, taking bribes and losing their lives;\nSome succumbed to epidemics;\nSome were caught in rebellion and plunder.\nThose beyond pardon were executed,\nLeaving them childless and without heirs,\nTheir tonsured remains burned,\nTheir yin souls without refuge, their yang souls without support.\nDeprived of offerings in spring and autumn,\nTheir messages carried only by crows and magpies.\nGathered, they become disasters of drought and flood;\nScattered, they become pests of locusts and caterpillars.\nThough their merit was great, it went unrecognized,\nWith no means to be enshrined and venerated;\nThough their crimes were grave, they may yet repent,\nSeeking refuge to amend their ways.\nAll sink into the Five Sufferings,\nAll stagnate in the Nine Dark Realms.\nWithout the grace of the Mystic Ones,\nThey cannot escape the netherworld.\n\nWe humbly beseech the Merciful and Sagely True Lord of the Northern Culmen,\nTo command the spirits of mountains, rivers, and earth,\nThe lords of altars, temples, and city gods,\nTo pursue, summon, and guide them,\nSearching far and wide.\nMay they all come to the numinous altar,\nTo listen and receive.\nMay they all renounce the ghostly registers,\nAnd don the celestial regalia.\nBathed in the waves of grace,\nMay they transcend to the fruits of sageliness.\nAscending to the Golden Gates in carefree ease,\nThey shall offer praise in the Jade Capital.\nWith the sages’ boundless favor,\nAnd the gods’ power to uplift,\nMay they be reborn within the Middle Kingdom,\nSurely entering the gates of supreme goodness.\n\nThus, we pray that the master of this fast may extend blessings to kin and allies,\nHonor spreading to the loyal and filial.\nMay calamities be utterly extinguished,\nAnd auspicious qi converge as one.\nMay the earth’s vitality flourish,\nAnd Heaven’s patterns shine in mystery.\nMay baleful stars withdraw their radiance,\nAnd propitious qi surge with light.\nMay the Mystic Transformation expand,\nAnd the imperial domain flourish.\nMay rivers run clear and seas be calm,\nRain fall in season and winds be gentle.\nMay the hundred grains burgeon in abundance,\nAnd the five weapons be stilled.\nMay the myriad people enjoy wealth and joy,\nAnd the Nine Virtues shine forth.\nMay all things thrive,\nAnd all creatures fulfill their natures.\n\nAbove, may the Celestial Worthies’ compassionate grace descend;\nBelow, may our sincerity in devotion be answered.\n\n**Respectfully presented for your attention.**\n\n**Vows**\nFirst, we vow that the Great Dao,\nSerene and formless,\nDwelling in tranquility and emptiness,\nAbiding in clarity,\nMay widely open the gates of the Dharma,\nInstructing the stubborn and wayward.\nMay all receive its beneficent grace,\nAnd cultivate with diligence.\nMay those who study together,\nAll ascend to the void,\nPreserving harmony with Heaven,\nAnd abiding forever without care.\n\nSecond, we vow that the myriad heavens,\nFormed of pure and settled qi,\nVast and lofty in their embrace,\nMay guard the Perfected and secure the numinous.\nMay the seasons be harmonious,\nAnd the Four Movements balanced.\nMay the state be secure and the people prosperous,\nAnd all under Heaven enjoy peace.\nMay all beings be broadly delivered,\nAnd the blessings extend to all life.\nMay Heaven be preserved for eternity,\nUnshaken through countless kalpas.\n\nThird, we vow that the earth,\nBoundless in its bearing,\nMay remain stable and unshaken,\nThe seas unyielding and uncollapsed.\nMay it safeguard states and households,\nAnd the multitudes thrive in accord.\nMay the living be nurtured and the dead find rest,\nIts blessings extending to the ten directions.\nMay crops flourish,\nAnd enterprises daily prosper.\nMay all receive its abundant support,\nAnd the myriad beings follow in harmony.\n\nFourth, we vow that the sun and moon,\nThe two luminaries, lofty and bright,\nMay know no eclipses,\nTheir waxing and waning serene and clear.\nMay their light illumine the heavens,\nDispelling all darkness.\nMay they safeguard the kalpas,\nAnd the world’s destiny be peaceful.\nMay their beneficent moisture be universally bestowed,\nAnd their blessings shower upon all beings.\n\nFifth, we vow that the stars,\nEqual in brilliance to the sun and moon,\nMay revolve and shine,\nIlluminating the ten directions.\nMay each remain in its proper place,\nMoving in straight paths.\nMay they safeguard states and households,\nFree from calamity and harm.\nMay the Four Seas be united in peace,\nAnd all under Heaven flourish.\n\nSixth, we vow that the four seasons,\nFollowing their cycles,\nMay bring harmonious climates,\nFree from disaster and affliction.\nMay plagues and poisons vanish,\nAnd all under Heaven enjoy peace.\nMay the five grains ripen in abundance,\nAnd the state be rich, the people joyful.\n\nSeventh, we vow that floating clouds,\nFormed of gathered qi and mist,\nMay drift high and clear in the sky,\nShading the mysterious and profound.\nWhen concealed, they are non-acting;\nWhen dispersed, they fill the heavens.\nMay immortals and sages dwell together,\nForming friendships with the host of Perfected.\nMay their blessings flow to all,\nReviving the state and cherishing the people,\nDelivering the multitudes,\nAnd sharing the kalpas’ span.\n\nEighth, we vow that wind and rain,\nFlowing and showering without end,\nMay be universally bestowed,\nNurturing growth.\nMay all things flourish,\nAnd the state’s stores and people’s wealth abound.\n\nNinth, we vow that the Five Peaks,\nEach secure in its place,\nTowering and vast in their embrace,\nMay long serve as palaces of immortals.",

we pledged to propagate the true teachings and deliver both the living and the departed.\nWhatever we present here is rightfully submitted for your consideration.\nThe officiant, disciple [Name], holds a position of weighty responsibility.\nAssisting the Dao in establishing merit, they magnify goodness and uphold the Dharma.\nYet we observe that in recent years, within these borders,\nthe people have suffered misfortune and calamity.\nThough there has been no drought or flood, the qi remains disordered.\nPoverty, sickness, and plague afflict the weak, leaving them starved and destitute.\nThe multitudes languish, stricken by unseen harm;\nthe trembling masses perish in distress.\nThus, bodies remain unpreserved, lives incomplete.\nThe old and young alike fall prey to illness, death heaped upon death.\nFor mortals in this world, life is but a fleeting moment—\nswift as lightning, rapid as the wind, scarcely held secure.\nThe causes of death are manifold:\nSome serve their lords with selfless devotion, repaying their sovereigns with loyalty,\ndying in battle, heedless of survival.\nOthers, driven by greed, perish in pursuit of wealth.\nSome chase fame and office, only to meet their end in the quest for glory.\nOthers, of cruel and deceitful nature,\nshow no kindness to creatures, no mercy to people.\nTheir hearts harbor perversity, their tempers flare unchecked.\nWhen illness strikes, none tend to them;\nonce afflicted, they swiftly succumb.\nOr, pressed by hunger and cold, assailed within and without,\nthey perish by the roadside, unclaimed by any.\nSome are dragged by swine or pulled by dogs;\nothers are gnawed by rats or devoured by insects,\ndying in torment on the road, their corpses filling ditches.\nSome lie exposed to wind and sun,\nwashed by rain, eroded by frost,\ntheir flesh unseen, their bones left bare.\nSome lack limbs, others lack heads or feet,\ntheir bodies scattered, a piteous sight.\nNow, we gather their remains, burying them together,\nregardless of gender or age.\nWe spare them from exposure, ensuring all are covered and concealed.\nMoreover, in the great teachings, compassion is fundamental.\nThe first duty is to shelter the dead, a principle that moves us to sorrow.\nThe sages of old, the Confucian masters, established rites:\nplanting pines upon burial mounds to guard against earth’s encroachment,\nburying bones and flesh to spare the living from lament.\nThus, they sought harmony for the living and safety for the dead.\nIs this fate’s decree, or the dictates of right principle?\nOur hearts ache with grief, our outward gaze brims with pity.\nTherefore, we come to this place, preparing the Daoist fast and offering.\nWe humbly present our repentance and gratitude, that it may ascend to the Thirty-Six Heavens;\nwe broadly proclaim our refuge, that it may resound through the Ten Directions.\nWe prostrate ourselves, beseeching the Perfected Sages and the Most High Venerables,\nto command the Offices of the Three Officials and Five Emperors,\nand proclaim to the Six Realms and Nine Dark Realms:\nbestow abundant grace, bring all to peace and stability.\nPardon the transgressions of the living and the dead,\nrelease them from the torments of judgment and suffering.\nBathe them in celestial blessings, cleanse the shades of the underworld.\nRefine and deliver their forms and souls, freeing them from sin and affliction.\nMay the living receive aid and protection;\nmay the dead attain rebirth.\nThe officiant, [Name], undertakes this burial,\ncreating a shared tomb for all.\nMay each rest in their proper place, all find their due.\nMay they swiftly attain rebirth, unobstructed by lingering ties.\n\nWe further pray for harmonious seasons and balanced qi,\nfor the prosperity of all beings and the peace of the age.\nMay the vast night realms ever offer the chance for redemption;\nmay the distant heavens fulfill the vow of tranquility.\nAbove, may the great compassion of the Heavenly Venerables be manifest;\nbelow, may our sincerity in devotion be answered.\n\nWe humbly submit this entreaty.\n\n**Vows**\nFirst, may the Great Dao spread far and wide, and all under heaven embrace its virtue.\nSecond, may all sentient beings awaken to the Dao.\nThird, may the souls of the Nine Nights be liberated at once.\nFourth, may the lonely and forsaken all find rebirth.\nFifth, may the world know peace and the five grains flourish.\nSixth, may ministers be loyal and children filial, rulers benevolent and fathers kind.\nSeventh, may the four seas unite, and enemies and kin be reconciled.\nEighth, may those in hidden wombs and eggs all be born and thrive.\nNinth, may chronic and acute illnesses swiftly heal.\nTenth, may the destitute and

      "translated_text": "May we dwell in mountain vales and secluded grottoes, vanish our traces by numinous springs. Casting off the clamor of the dusty world, we refine ourselves in secret wonders. Yet the true and merciful nurture all beings as their first priority; the Great Dao delivers humanity by establishing merit as its foundation. Thus we humbly petition for salvation, universally extending to both the hidden and the manifest. Though the dead may plead for deliverance, their karmic bonds are not easily severed. Now, in accordance with the sacred decree, how dare we not make this known above?\n\nHaving recited the petition and verified its words, we find the supplicant’s aspiration lies in liberation and salvation. In this long night of the unseen, compassion and sorrow are our duty. We reflect that the Great Image divides its form to endow life and nurture essence. Riding harmony and yielding to fate, we embody earth and emulate heaven. Yet the void and purity are difficult to preserve, and the mechanisms of karma easily lead astray. Consciousness drifts with the dust, illusory realms shift and change. Transgressions and errors abound, the tally of sins is immeasurable. Sunk in the eternal night of the underworld, redemption seems impossible across countless kalpas. Only through devoted cultivation may we hope for ascent and deliverance.\n\nTherefore, we lay bare our hearts before the Three Caverns and surrender our lives to the hosts of heaven. The Yellow Register unfolds its rites of repentance and deliverance; the Mysterious Capital possesses the ranks for the transference of spirits. With utmost sincerity and purity, we seek to atone for our faults and transgressions. Each of us directs the cinnabar heart, praying for auspicious blessings.\n\nToday, at the midpoint of the ritual circuit, the assembly of Dharma practitioners raises the first incense offering. May the smoke of this incense ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe, your servants, surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves to the ground, reverently relying upon the Three August Ones of the Supreme. May these merits flow to the revered spirits of the state altars and the ancestral sages of our lineage. May they ascend and wander in the true realms, transcend and attain the ranks of immortality. May they feast in the Southern Palace and bestow blessings upon the Northern Gate. May the imperial destiny endure forever, the sagely lifespan extend boundlessly. May the sound of their teachings spread across the eight seas, uniting the chariots and writings of the ten thousand nations.",

Their grace extends to the hidden and the manifest, their blessings pervade heaven and earth. Having encountered this decree, we now exhaust our sincerity, establishing merit to propagate the Dao and uphold its luminous teachings.\n\nThe patron of this retreat, so-and-so, for the sake of the departed soul—whose form was shaped in remote antiquity, whose qi was received from the primordial heavens—from beginningless time until this day, has followed the turning of karmic conditions, deluded within the dream-realm. The six senses stirred dust, the ten fetters obscured the nature. Easily were sins born, swiftly did transgressions accumulate. Some offenses violated the true numina, others transgressed prohibitions and taboos, offending the heavenly Dao above and disrupting the earthly shades below. There were instances of intentional killing or accidental harm, greed for wealth that harmed righteousness. They lacked the virtue of compassion and yielding, disrupted the harmony of ritual and music. They encroached upon and harmed living beings, damaged and destroyed creatures’ lives. Their sins bound the courts of the Three Officials, their names filled the registers of the Five Emperors. Since the body’s dissolution, they have faced karmic retribution—some detained in the dark prisons, others adrift in alien destinies. Endlessly they wander in the long night, with no means of deliverance.\n\nThus, we gather our hearts in prayer, pouring out our pleas to heaven. We present patterned silks to fulfill the rites of supplication, prepare dragon-brocade tokens to convey the pledges for the soul’s ascent. We kindle the Nine Dark Lamps to illuminate the long night, perform the rites to the ten directions’ sagely titles to open the path through dense darkness. Above, we report to the various heavens; below, we notify the various earths, extending to the realms of the Five Peaks and Fengdu, the paths of the three evil destinies and six destinies. May the dew of compassion quench their scorching toil, may the winds of mercy dispel their burning afflictions. May enmities be reconciled, debts and disputes resolved. May the black ledgers on Mount Fengdu be burned, the red records on the Southern Culmen inscribed. May a thousand transgressions and ten thousand errors all be expunged. May they be refined in the Court of Flowing Fire, their souls purified in the Palace of Lesser Yin. Ascending to the ranks of immortals, they shall ride the celestial thoroughfares. Thus, may the Three Luminaries shine upon the Two Modes, may the Five Weapons be sheathed and the Hundred Grains flourish. May the celestial mandate abound, the sagely lifespan extend. May the dragon spirits endure, secretly aiding wind and rain. May all living beings be harmoniously nurtured, all in the patron’s household—living and deceased—receive blessings, their kin prosper. May the dark courts and nether ferries together attain true fruition. Above, may this manifest the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy; below, may it fulfill our devotion in taking refuge.\n\nRespectfully submitted for your attention.\n\nVows:\nFirst vow: May the Great Dao abide in tranquil emptiness, at ease in stillness and void, dwelling in clarity. May it widely open the gates of the Dharma, instructing the stubborn. May all receive its grace, cultivate with diligence, and join the assembly of learners, universally ascending to the void. May they preserve harmony with heaven, enduring without care.\n\nSecond vow: May the various heavens condense qi and clarify, their vast expanse sheltering and preserving the true and numinous. May the climate be regulated, the four seasons harmonious. May the nation be secure, the people prosperous, all under heaven tranquil. May all be broadly delivered, their blessings reaching all living beings. May the heavens endure, unshaken for countless kalpas.\n\nThird vow: May the earth bear and sustain without end, stable and unyielding, the seas and abysses unshaken.

May each remain in its proper place, their paths straight. May they protect and secure the nation and households, free from calamity. May the four seas be at peace, all under heaven flourish.\n\nSixth vow: May the four seasons follow their cycles, the climate harmonious, free from disaster. May plagues and poisons vanish, all under heaven at peace. May the five grains ripen abundantly, the nation prosper and the people rejoice.\n\nSeventh vow: May floating clouds condense qi and gather mist, soaring high and clarifying, shading the mysterious. Concealed, they are quiescent; dispersed, they fill the heavens. May immortals and transcendents dwell together, befriending the hosts of perfected beings. May their grace flow to all, benefiting the nation and cherishing the people. May all beings be universally delivered, sharing the kalpa’s years.\n\nEighth vow: May wind and rain flow and shower without end, universally bestowing their bounty. May all things flourish, the nation’s stores and people’s wealth abound.\n\nNinth vow: May the Five Peaks each remain in their proper place, towering and encompassing, ever serving as immortal palaces.

Some bear sins beyond absolution, grievous transgressions without measure, knotted fast and never undone. They may dwell in the ten directions of the cosmos, within the Five Peaks or the Nine Netherworlds, or under the governance of the Water Palace or Earth Bureau, confined in the dark courts of night, where wretched souls and suffering shades are held fast in the depths of the Yellow Springs. There, they endure the torments of water, fire, wind, and blade, day and night, their forms and spirits broken, their pain unbearable. Their afflictions extend to descendants, calamity flowing to later generations. In the endless dark of the netherworld, there is no path to liberation. Following the scriptural ordinances, we humbly seek their deliverance. Through the earnest observance of this retreat and the rites of repentance, we beseech mercy, offering our sincere devotion and praying for the gaze of the Mysterious One.\n\nAt this moment, as [Name] conducts the ritual and the assembly of the dharma invokes the first offering of incense, may this fragrant smoke ascend directly to honor the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao. We surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves in reverence, and turn in devotion to the Three Supreme Ones. May the merit of this act flow to [Name]’s family—thirty-six generations, nine ancestors, seven lineages—and to all departed spirits and hidden souls. May the radiance of the divine descend to illuminate the ninefold darkness, and may the power of the Dao suffuse all, ending the trials in every prison. May enmities dissolve, sins be absolved, souls bathed in the Pool of Flowing Fire, and rebirth granted within the Palace of Southern Florescence. May celestial robes adorn their forms and the dew of wisdom purify their hearts. May they forever sever evil ties and forever ascend to the realm of blessings.\n\nNow, as incense is kindled, we take refuge in the great sagely assembly, the perfected virtues of the Most High, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into the realm of Non-Action, harmonizing with the True Dao.\n\nAs [Name] conducts the ritual and the assembly of the dharma invokes the second offering of incense, may this fragrant smoke ascend directly to honor the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.

May the merit of this act flow to the state, to the august rites of the Nine Temples, and to the ancestral sages of the imperial line. May their spirits gather in the Crimson Towers, bestowing blessings upon the grand design. May the emperor’s virtue align with the Three Absences, his benevolence spread to the Nine Realms.

      "translated_text": "**Collected by Master Du Guangting of the Tang Dynasty**\n\n**On Repentance**\n\nTo conduct the Dao and establish the fast, order is fundamental. Even slight disorder disrupts the proper form. When perception falters, ritual deportment and musical offerings falter in their reverence. Not only does this invite censure from the celestial courts, but it also risks ridicule from fellow practitioners.\n\nShould wind and rain approach during rites at the open altar, or in the swelter of summer or the biting cold of winter; if dawn or dusk arrives untimely, or unexpected disturbances arise—halting the proceedings abruptly would cause panic and disorder, while adhering strictly to the statutes would delay and inconvenience. In such cases, the chief cantor may lead the assembly in *stepping the void* before the altar, invoking the divine. If the disturbance is severe, simplify the rites to their essence: the *Three Petitions* and *Great Thanksgiving* will suffice. Adapt to the moment, lest rigidity become one’s undoing.\n\n**Twenty Directions’ General Repentance**\n\nThe assembled officers face north as the chief cantor intones:\n*\"We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Ten Poles’ Heavenly Lords, the Three Luminaries and Five Peaks, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Sacred Scriptures, and all divine immortals and spirit-officials.\"*\n\nAfter bowing, each repents with reverence. As the cantor invokes each direction, all bow once:\n*\"We humbly recall: the Dao acts through non-action, and virtue governs without dominion. It encompasses the myriad dharmas as the greatest within the realm and spans the nine schools to open the gate of all mysteries. The principles of good and evil are distinct, and the statutes of sin and blessing clearly manifest. Thus, the Vermilion Register of the Southern Palace records ascent as the reward for goodness, while the Black Book of the Northern Bureau inscribes death as the reckoning for transgression. These serve to punish and encourage, rescuing the benighted. Only after clarifying the origins of the teaching can one align with the intent of non-action.*\n\n*Now, on behalf of the sponsor of this Great Yellow Register Fast, the official [Name], who cherishes loyalty and filial piety, and whose gratitude to sovereign and kin runs deep, we initiate this rite of incense and devotion to repay the kindness of nurture. With fragrant offerings, ritual gifts, dragon-jade, and patterned silks, we take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the perfected deities of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the True Lords of the Sacred Mountains and Grotto-Heavens, the Five Peaks, the Water Palaces’ revered spirits, the Three Treasures’ officials, the Ten Directions and Three Realms, and all true numina. We beseech the grace of celebration and bestowal, the descent of great compassion’s blessings.*\n\n*May the sponsor’s [Name] household—ancestors of a hundred thousand generations, the wandering souls in the cold courts of eternal night—all be liberated. May the three affinal and five consanguineous kin, all relations and dependents, have their misfortunes erased from the Nine Yin and their blessings born in the Three Luminaries. May calamities cease, and longevity extend. May the Emperor’s sagacity surpass that of Fuxi and Shennong, his years equaling heaven and earth. May the Crown Prince and regional lords long assist in this flourishing era. May the Empress, consorts, and concubines forever uphold the sacred enterprise. May the myriad officials and feudal lords devote themselves to its support. May the four seas and ten thousand lands be transformed by unified culture. May weapons fall silent and wind and rain follow their course. May the sun and moon retain their purity, and the stars their proper motion. May Fengdu’s judgments be stayed, and all creatures dwell in safety. May we all embody the lineage of clarity and stillness, and together realize the Dao of the subtle and formless. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\"*\n\n**Twenty Directions’ Sequential Repentance**\n\nThe assembled officers move left, stand facing east, and the chief cantor intones:\n*\"We, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Eastern Direction’s Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, and the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Eastern Realm.\"*\n\nAfter bowing, each repents with reverence.\n*\"Eastern Direction...\"*",

Next, for the chief patron’s nine generations of lingering attachments, whose transgressions are recorded in the ledgers of Mount Tai, and for his five clans of kin, whose names are inscribed among the immortals of the Eastern Dipper: may misfortunes cease, and the span of fortune and longevity be prolonged.

First, we pray for the sagely person’s supreme fortune and the flourishing of the great enterprise. May the red crow manifest its auspiciousness, and the vermilion phoenix arrive in ceremony. May border cities know no alarms of beacon fires, and distant lands present tribute by land and sea. Next, for the chief patron’s household—his nine generations and seven ancestors refining their essences in the Vermilion Mound, and his five clans and six relations whose names are inscribed on the cinnabar registers—may misfortunes cease, and past faults dissolve of themselves.

We humbly pray that blessings extend to the imperial palace, preserving peace and prosperity. May the dragon’s chart and marchmount’s stability endure, and the phoenix’s records align with heaven’s order. For the sponsor’s family, may their nine generations of ancestors ascend beyond the dark realms of Youdu; may their six relations enjoy radiant peace, basking in the sacred sun’s brilliance. May sins be extinguished and disasters dispelled, with longevity and emoluments everlasting. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.\n\n**Central Marchmount**\nWe, your humble servants, have heard that as the revered of the four wilds and the chief of all mountains, the lofty Songshan stands supreme among the marchmounts, its towering heights reaching heaven. With thirty-six peaks rising and falling, its verdant hues span Gong and Luo; stretching for myriad miles, its azure expanse upholds the vault of heaven.

After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.\n\n**Water Palace**\nWe, your humble servants, have heard that the highest virtue lies in merit, governing the Kan Palace to accumulate power; the most yielding nature flows through the Xun Sea to still its waves. It draws its numen from the primordial chaos and extends its sageliness beyond heaven and earth. Floating the sky and bathing the sun, its boundless source defies measure; spanning the earth and steaming clouds, its vast expanse eludes comprehension. Below, it opens the dragon gods’ palace and divides the bureaus of sin and blessing. Its governance is impartial, sustaining both the hidden and the manifest.\n\nNow, the sponsor of this grand Yellow Register Retreat, [Name], acting for family and state, repents transgressions and seeks grace.

We humbly pray that blessings from the nine heavens flow to all nations. May turtle-script and dragon-seals herald auspicious omens in the age of Yao; may seas be calm and rivers clear, matching the sacred era’s longevity. For the sponsor’s family, may the nine generations of ancestral spirits erase their names from the water palace’s ledgers of sin; may their five relations and six kin be recorded in the immortal registers of Peng Palace. May disasters naturally cease and emoluments ever grow. May all creatures, winged and swimming, together receive the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.\n\n**Sacred Scriptures**\nWe, your humble servants, have heard that the Great Dao divides its light, first expounding the wordless teaching; the Heavenly Worthy spreads transformation, gradually bestowing the written works. Thus, qi coalesces into chapters, and clouds congeal into seals. Each character spans a zhang, radiating eight-cornered numinous rays; their traces scatter across the heavens, harmonizing with the five assemblies’ tones. The twelve hundred precepts, twelve thousand rules of deportment, thirty-six divisions of sacred scriptures, and three thousand six hundred canons and statutes—cultivating them leads to immortality and transcendence as a divine immortal; upholding them aids the state, guides the sovereign, pacifies the people, and benefits all beings. They encompass all methods and universally deliver sentient beings.\n\nNow, the sponsor of this grand Yellow Register Retreat, [Name], acting for family and state, repents transgressions and seeks grace. With utmost sincerity, they take refuge in the Most True and Supreme Thirty-Six Divisions of Sacred Scriptures, the natural scriptural precepts, the orthodox Dharma of the ten directions, the secret treasuries of all heavens, the true writs and precious talismans, the scripture-attending divine lords, ministers, and officials, and all the divine bureaus of ritual and dharma protection. We humbly pray that blessings descend from the nine heavens, bestowing prosperity upon all nations. May the sacred body be harmonious and flourishing, and the precious mandate enduring. For the sponsor’s family, may the nine generations of ancestral spirits be inscribed on the cinnabar tablets; may their six relations and kin be ranked in the purple registers. May disasters be eradicated and blessings with longevity ever expand. May the three paths and nine nights together bathe in the divine merit. After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to unite with the True.\n\n*Concluding the Forty-First Scroll of the* **Ritual of the Yellow Register Retreat of the Most High**\n*Beginning the Forty-Second Scroll*\n*Compiled by Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting*",

      "translated_text": "**Rite for Pacifying the Dwelling and Circulating the Dao**\n\nThe assembled officials first take their positions before the Mysterious Master and stand in formation. They chant the *Dao*, enter the chamber, and circumambulate, beginning with the offering of incense to the Five Directions in the east. They then present incense at the imperial altar and at their respective stations, each bowing to the Master while visualizing as prescribed.\n\n*Guardian Spirits*, radiant and luminous at dawn,\nPurple mists ascend through empty space.\nStellar altars gleam resplendent,\nTransforming into cloud-palaces.\nThe solar essence and lunar spirit,\nWinged between *Li* and *Kan*.\nGolden Perfected issue their commands,\nDragons and tigers dispel Fengdu’s shades.\nOn this auspicious day, the rite proceeds,\nEight Mighty Ones drum in attendance.\nJade blossoms unfold, rainbow banners swirl,\nHeavenly light descends, the Dao’s *qi* flourishes.\nAll beings receive universal deliverance,\nJoy flows without end.\n\n**Twenty-four strikes of the ritual drum.**\n\nO Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, Three *Qi* of the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao: Summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendant Officials of Left and Right, the Incense-Bearing Golden Youth, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maiden, and the Thirty-Two Fragrant Officials of the Five Thearchs and the Direct Day. Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn attire, to open the gates of the Mysterious Altar and invoke the Celestial Lords and Divine Sovereigns. May the deities of this land and its boundaries, the true officials and upright spirits, attend in mind.\n\nWe pray that the wondrous light of the Jade Clarity’s Dao-*qi* and Numinous Treasure descend and flow into our bodies, that our petitions swiftly ascend to the presence of the Supreme, Boundless, and Great Dao—before the Jade Threshold of the Formless and Spontaneous Golden Gate.\n\n**Each declares their ritual rank:**\n\nWe, your humble servants, in unison and sincerity, reverently address the Formless and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Boundless Great Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of the August Heaven, the Great Sage Assemblies and Perfected Lords of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords, the Jade Clarity Emperor, the Great Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, the Seven Jeweled Mysterious Terrace of the Jade Capital and Golden Gates in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Numinous Treasure Perfected Sovereign of Luminous Augustness, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the officials of the Three Realms, the Perfected Immortals of the Grotto-Heavens, the Five Primordial Thearchs, the Numinous Treasure’s Mighty Spirits, and all true numina above and below.\n\nWe have heard that the Great Dao fuses with the true, and the Primordial August One governs the course of destiny. The Five Scriptures unfold the teachings, and the Three Caverns proclaim their practice. The Heavenly Worthy bestows the ordinances of boundless deliverance; the Supreme One spreads limitless grace. All beings are shaped and refined, all lives rescued and uplifted. We, having accumulated good causes over countless kalpas, have been bathed in the mysterious transformation. Dragon scripts and phoenix records, jade tablets and jasper scrolls—we have been privileged to receive and cultivate them, seeking ascent and deliverance. Yet at the outset of our vows, we pledge salvation as our foremost duty. No petition may be withheld or denied. How much more so when commanded by sacred decree—dare we not make this known above?\n\n**The petition is read.**\n\nAs the words express, our sincerity is earnest and our devotion profound. It is fitting that deliverance be granted, that the mysterious compassion be fulfilled.\n\nWe reflect that before the Five Ultimates, the Three Spirits divided their transformations. In the lower antiquity, customs remained uncorrupted. Dwellings were carved into cliffs and nests built in trees; all embraced the Dao and held fast to virtue. Each found contentment in their place, harmonizing in effortless non-action. But when the myriad signs of yin and yang appeared, and the symbols of beams and rafters arose, fortune and misfortune, good and evil, intertwined in mutual succession. Those who followed the natural order enjoyed generations of blessings; those who defied it suffered calamities and afflictions. The sages, moved by compassion, made salvation their heart’s work. Through repentance of sins and prayer for grace, they exalted the rectitude of the retreat. We now humbly join together, adhering to the canonical rites. We establish the altar and seek blessings and protection.\n\nToday, as we proceed with the rite, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the first pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend through the void, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Dao.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full submission, reverently relying on the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow to the august spirits of the altars of state and the ancestral shrines. May the Celestial Capital gleam with radiant purity, and the Purple Culmen extend its blessings. May fortune grace the imperial residence, and felicity transmit the imperial enterprise. May it stand as firm as Mount Song and Mount Heng, and shine as brightly as the sun and moon. May the Crown Prince and the various princes inherit and uphold the sagely enterprise. May worthy ministers and good counselors ably assist in planning and strategy. May the myriad states come as if by bridge and boat, and all beings enjoy peace and prosperity.\n\nFor this purpose, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assemblies, the virtues of the Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao in truth.\n\nToday, as we proceed with the rite, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the second pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend through the void, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Scriptures.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full submission, reverently relying on the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow to the nine ancestors and seven generations of the sponsor’s family, and to the departed spirits in the hidden realms. May they dwell in the Crimson Garden and refine their souls on the Cinnabar Terrace. May they don the *qi* of immortality and ascend to the cloudy peaks, entrusting themselves to transformation. May fortune bless their descendants, and grace extend to both the living and the dead. May they ever bear the mysterious felicity and constantly receive primal auspiciousness.\n\nFor this purpose, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the Great Sage Assemblies, the virtues of the Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao in truth.\n\nToday, as we proceed with the rite, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the third pinch of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend through the void, directly offering reverence to the Supreme Perfected Treasure of the Masters.\n\nWe dedicate our bodies and lives, prostrating ourselves in full submission, reverently relying on the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow to the sponsor’s household, their kin and relatives, bringing them shared blessings. May their fortune extend and their lives endure; may misfortunes vanish and calamities dissolve. May the dragon spirits of the dwelling, the yin and yang officers, and the terrestrial officials receive promotions in rank and rewards for merit, their titles and honors augmented. May they bring auspicious protection to the central palace and dispel disasters and misfortunes from the outer realms.",

The covenantal might suspends the statutes that aid the state, and the Numinous Treasure sets forth the forms of repentance and entreaty. Whatever is sought is surely attained through resonance.\n\nYour disciple, so-and-so, dwells amidst the dust of the world and has not yet fathomed the subtle and wondrous. Yet in choosing this site for construction, the dwelling may not be auspicious. We fear we have offended the true spirits and violated prohibitions, contravening the signs of the Eight Dwellings and Five Phases, and failing in the directions of yin, yang, punishment, and virtue. Overcome with anxiety and doubt, we now present our repentance and thanksgiving.\n\nThus, we solemnly prepare the altar and meticulously follow the canonical rites. With reverence, we offer incense and flowers, devoutly performing the fast. We turn our hearts to the Ten Poles, repenting our sins before all heavens.

May all inauspicious spirits be dispelled.\n\nShould there be any quarrying of timber or moving of stones, any groundbreaking or construction that offends the true spirits of heaven and earth, disrupts the true qi of yin and yang, encroaches upon the Earthly Mansion, or violates the numinous spirits—though the realms of the unseen and visible differ, and mortal understanding is limited—we now repent and offer thanks, beseeching that all be dissolved.\n\nMay the true qi be proclaimed and spread, the dragon spirits stand guard. May disasters and calamities be eradicated, and blessings and goodness come forth. May the dwelling be secure and tranquil, all movements harmonious and peaceful.

May the lingering dead and stagnant qi, the bound souls and hidden spirits, all receive blessings and each be delivered. May they abandon evil and return to the correct, attune to the Dao and commune with the true.\n\nMay the imperial reign be long and distant, the vitality of the people bright and flourishing. May all under heaven be wholly saved, and every moving thing partake in glory. Above, may the vast grace of the Illuminated Heavenly Worthy be manifest; below, may our repentant sincerity be answered.\n\n*Making vows:*\n\nFirst, may heaven and earth be bright and pure;\nSecond, may the atmosphere be clear and mysterious;\nThird, may the sage live ten thousand years;\nFourth, may transformation reach the eight limits;\nFifth, may heaven bestow sweet dew;\nSixth, may earth emit auspicious mist;\nSeventh, may the four seasons follow their courses;\nEighth, may all things grow whole;\nNinth, may households abound in filial piety and fraternal duty;\nTenth, may the state teem with talent and worthies;\nEleventh, may the merit of the fast spread widely;\nTwelfth, may good omens daily increase.\n\n*Replenishing the incense burner:*\n\nIncense Official Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Attendant Incense Spirits—may the place where we offer incense naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms.

These offenses, accumulated through the ages, have:\n\n**Offended above** the great sages of the myriad heavens, the host of honored ones of the Great Dao, the Three Luminaries and Five Phases, the deities governing the void, wind, clouds, thunder, and rain.\n**Offended below** the Five Marchmounts and all mountains, the thirty-six earthly realms, the mounds and water palaces, and the underworld officials.\n**Offended within** the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces, the yin-yang bureaus, the ancient and modern numinous sages, and the worthies of former ages.\n\nThey have violated the Five Constants and transgressed against the Four Great Elements. Their names are inscribed in the ledgers of sin, and calamities are bound at the gates of darkness. Their lifespans were cut short, failing to fulfill Heaven’s allotted span. After their bodies perished, they remained detained in the earthly courts, confined as suffering souls in the deepest prisons. They have endured every torment, undergone every trial, shuttled through the Three Wretched Paths, and drifted through the Five Destinies. Subjected to cruel punishments and exhausting labors, their forms are broken and emaciated beyond endurance. Their offenses and misfortunes linger unending, with no hope of absolution.\n\nToday, in accordance with the ranks of the transcendent immortals, we repent our sins and seek mercy. We burn incense, light lamps, conduct the fast, and practice the Dao, surrendering our lives to the Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Ten Directions, the perfected great sages who have attained the Dao, the true lords and venerable ones, and the divine officials of the ten celestial realms.\n\nWe humbly implore the Three Honored Ones and the great sages of the myriad heavens to open the fount of great compassion and bestow boundless grace. May they command the flying celestial beings to bear the Nine Dragon Talismanic Decrees, proclaiming to the courts of the Ten Directions and the officials of the underworld hells: absolve the boundless sins accumulated through the ages. Open the Nine Dark Hells and release the souls of the long night. Bathe them in the Crimson Mound’s courts, clothe them in the regalia of the Cavernous Yang’s precincts. May they be reborn in the blessed realms of the divine, and may blessings flow to their descendants. May auspicious protection ever attend them, and may the living and the dead alike find peace. May this uphold the nation’s fortune and extend to all beings. May all attain the mysterious bliss and forever ascend to the true ranks. After attaining the Dao, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao and uniting with the true.\n\n**East**\nWe now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so, who conducts the great fast of expiation and examination, recites the scriptures, and practices the Dao, surrendering our lives to the Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the East, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, and the divine officials of the eastern celestial realm. We repent for the boundless transgressions committed by so-and-so’s thirty-six generations of ancestors, from the myriad past forebears to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. These sins, accumulated through the ages, include:\n\nActs contrary to kindness and nurturance, lacking benevolence and humanity; disloyalty to lords and teachers, failing in filial piety; harming the good and upright, offending the divine; violating the Five Constants and indulging in all manner of evil; curses and malevolent prayers, killing the innocent. Their punishments are severe, their calamities profound, yet they have not received absolution. Their souls are seized and beaten, confined in the Wood Bureau’s Eastern Marchmount’s pounding hell, suffering the torments of sword trees, blade mountains, wind, and thunder. Day and night, they endure excruciating trials beyond endurance. Their misfortunes afflict their descendants, and their woes flow endlessly to later generations. In the endless dark of night, there is no means of deliverance.\n\nToday, we repent, seek mercy, conduct the fast, and practice the Dao. We humbly implore the great compassion to show mercy, and the myriad sages to turn their radiance toward us. May they proclaim to the courts of the Eastern Bureau and the officials of the underworld: untangle the knots of enmity, absolve the souls of their sins. May they be entrusted to the courts of blessings, ascend to the pure realms. May the living enjoy peace and prosperity, forever bearing the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, we shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao and uniting with the true.\n\n**South**\nWe now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this to so-and-so, who conducts the supreme wondrous fast of expiation and examination, recites the scriptures, and practices the Dao, surrendering our lives to the Limitless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the South, the Three Qi Heavenly Lords, and the divine officials of the southern celestial realm. We repent for the boundless transgressions committed by so-and-so’s thirty-six generations of ancestors, from the myriad past forebears to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. These sins, accumulated through the ages, include:\n\nFollowing cruel impulses to kill the innocent; making vows and pacts to inflict harm upon beings; lewd and improper conduct, oppressing the chaste and good; transgressing rites and decorum, indulging in evil deeds; offending Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, and all divine beings. Their punishments are severe, their calamities profound, yet they have not received absolution. Their souls are seized and beaten, confined in the Fire Bureau’s Southern Marchmount’s pounding hell, suffering the torments of furnace and charcoal, their forms burned and broken. Day and night, they endure excruciating trials beyond endurance. Their misfortunes afflict their descendants, flowing endlessly onward. In the endless dark of night, there is no means of deliverance.\n\nToday, we repent, seek mercy, conduct the fast, and practice the Dao.

We repent for the boundless sins committed by so-and-so across thirty-six generations, from countless ancestors to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. These sins may include: failing to yield with righteousness, flattery and deceit without cause; envying the worthy and able, defiling and disrupting the divine Dao; cruelty without measure, slaughter driven by whim; breaking vows and violating covenants, scheming with curses and hexes. The misfortunes and transgressions congeal like mountains, the punishments severe and the trials profound, yet no absolution has been granted. The souls are bound and detained in the Metal Bureau’s Hua Mountain hells, enduring the torments of copper pillars, iron beds, and golden hammers.

The souls are bound and arraigned in the Water Bureau’s Heng Mountain hells, suffering the agonies of freezing ice, night gardens, and icy rivers.

We repent for the boundless sins committed by so-and-so’s ancestors across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. In their lifetimes, they may have spoken ornately without substance, feigned truth with deceit, deceived the wise and foolish alike, or insulted true sages. They may have sided with the strong to oppress the weak, or indulged in greed and malice without restraint. They may have contended for profit and wealth, seized reputations and ranks, or schemed to harm and poison the loyal and good. They may have endangered others to secure their own safety, killed living beings for personal gain, or plundered wealth without pity for the orphaned and destitute. They may have sworn oaths and formed pacts, invoking gods and ghosts, thereby incurring karmic retribution that now lingers in the hidden realms. Their souls are bound in the earthly prisons and courts of torment, confined in dark cells, deprived of light. They endure ceaseless trials, suffering without end. Today, we conduct the fast and practice the Dao, repenting and seeking mercy.

They may have deceived both the hidden and the manifest, showing no fear of true spirits. The Nine Offices have imposed punishments, the Three Bureaus have meted out trials. Their souls are beaten and bound in the eternal night of the Nine Dark Prisons. They drift through the cold courts, confined in dark cells, lost in endless kalpas without light.

May they command the courts of the torment officials and the earthly prisons: deliver the souls, absolve their crimes, resolve grievances, and free them from suffering to be reborn in heaven.

Retribution remains unfulfilled, calamity deepens, and punishment grows heavier. Now, through the performance of this fast and the practice of the Dao, we repent and uproot the roots of sin. We prostrate ourselves, beseeching the august assembly of saints to open their mercy and grant pardon. We implore the underworld officials of Fengdu, the Nine Dark Prisons, and the halls of judgment to absolve the boundless karmic causes of past kalpas. May the destitute souls be delivered, freed from the depths of darkness, to roam the true realms and dwell in the land of blessings. May descendants enjoy peace and prosperity, and may the living and the dead alike find serenity. Should our plea be granted, we shall reverently bear the profound grace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\nThe Three Luminaries:\nWe now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this supreme and wondrous fast for the liberation of so-and-so, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the palaces of the sun, moon, and stars, the perfected and great sages, the divine immortals and all spirit-officials of the Three Luminaries. We repent for the boundless sins of so-and-so’s family—across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. They may have been unrighteous rulers, disloyal ministers, unkind fathers, or unfilial sons. They violated the celestial patterns and earthly principles, as well as the sun, moon, and stars, accumulating deep stains of evil. Their hidden sins and manifest transgressions were inscribed in the ledgers of wickedness. Upon death, their souls were seized by ghostly officials and confined in the eternal night’s halls of judgment. Beaten and bound in heavy fetters, they had no means of expiation. Now, through repentance and the seeking of grace, through the performance of this fast and the practice of the Dao, we prostrate ourselves, hoping the great sages of the heavens and the august assembly of the Three Luminaries will command the underworld prisons and halls of judgment to absolve their accumulated sins and reconcile their enmities. May their debts and disputes be settled, and may the living and the dead find peace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\nThe Five Peaks:\nWe now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this supreme and wondrous fast for the liberation of so-and-so, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the True Lords of the Five Peaks, the grotto-heavens of the famous mountains, and the divine immortals and all spirit-officials who have attained the Dao. We repent for the boundless sins of so-and-so’s family—across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. They may have recklessly provoked offenses, defying the divine. They violated the famous mountains and great rivers, the sacred sites and blessed lands, the lords of hills and plains, and the hidden officials and spirit-offices. Their sins coiled endlessly, never pardoned. Their souls were seized and bound in the earthly prisons of the Five Peaks. Their suffering was complete, endless through all time. Now, through the performance of this fast and the practice of the Dao, we repent and seek grace. We prostrate ourselves, hoping the myriad sages will extend their compassion and the heavens will witness and protect. We implore the officials of the Five Peaks’ prisons and halls of judgment to dissolve their enmities, wash away their sins, and eradicate all evil. May the Nine Dark Prisons be illuminated, and may our plea be granted, bearing the profound grace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\nThe Water Realms:\nWe now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this supreme and wondrous fast for the liberation of so-and-so, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the Great Emperor of Fusang, the Divine King of Yang Valley, the water emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Jiang, and the divine immortals and all spirit-officials of the Twelve River Sources and Water Realms. We repent for the boundless sins of so-and-so’s family—across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. They may have slighted the true spirits, disrespected the divine, defiled the springs, or harmed the rivers and marshes. Their transgressions became manifold, binding them in the nether courts. Their souls were seized and beaten, confined in the Water Realms’ prisons under the halls of judgment. They endured every torment, their suffering unbearable, hauling and drawing the dark waves to irrigate the Four Waterways. Through the icy rivers and freezing nights, their bodies cracked. They saw no light, with no means of deliverance. Now, through the performance of this fast and the practice of the Dao, we repent and seek grace. We prostrate ourselves, hoping the myriad sages will witness our plea and the Three August Ones will grant pardon. We implore the officials of the Water Realms’ prisons and halls of judgment to untie their enmities, absolve their sins, and erase their transgressions. May they depart the land of darkness and ascend to the realm of purity. May their souls be refined, attaining ranks to be born in heaven. May their sins be forever erased, and their descendants enjoy peace and prosperity. Should our plea be granted, we shall reverently bear the profound grace. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend into the formless, harmonizing with the Dao to become true.\n\nThe Sacred Scriptures:\nWe now reverently burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life, dedicating this supreme and wondrous fast for the liberation of so-and-so, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. We take refuge in the thirty-six divisions of the most perfected and supreme sacred scriptures, the true writs and precious talismans, the secret treasuries of the heavens, the true Dharma of the ten directions, and all spirit-officials who guard the scriptures. We repent for the boundless sins of so-and-so’s family—across a hundred million generations and thirty-six lineages, extending to the departed spirits and all kith and kin. In past kalpas and future kalpas, across a hundred million lives, through the deeds of the three karmas and the creations of the six senses, their hidden sins and manifest transgressions were heavy in judgment and deep in punishment. They may have slighted or desecrated texts, defiled sacred writs, slandered the holy scriptures, or leaked secret texts. Their calamities coiled endlessly, never repented. Their souls were seized and beaten, confined in the Nine Dark Prisons. They endured torture and were bound in dark fetters. Through the eternal night, they had no means of deliverance. Now, through repentance and the seeking of grace, through the performance of this fast and the practice of the Dao, we prostrate ourselves, hoping the spirit-officials will memorialize the throne and extend their merciful blessings. We implore the officials of the underworld prisons and halls of judgment to dissolve their karmic retributions and reconcile their enmities. May they transcend the gates of the Yellow Springs and ascend the path of blessings. May their descendants be secure and prosperous, and may the Nine Nights and Three Paths alike receive radiant protection. Should our plea be granted, we shall reverently bear the profound grace.

The Celestial Venerable expounded the Dharma, and the Three Caverns proclaimed its practice. Sacred instructions and numinous charts bring salvation to households and peace to the realm. Having been granted participation in the wondrous and true, we were permitted to receive and cultivate it. Yet first, we must establish merit to universally benefit both the hidden and the manifest. It is fitting to magnify the sagely teachings and broadly deliver heaven and humanity. None who sincerely submit shall be rejected or forsaken. Now, in obedience to the edict, how dare we not report above?\n\nReading the memorial:\nFollowing the memorial’s sincerity, we have joined together in mutual support. Consulting the codes of the numinous immortals and perusing the texts of the Yellow Register, we act on behalf of [Name] at the [Name] Abbey in [State and County], establishing the ritual forms of the Mystic Rite and modeling the Two Modes. We present the lamps, candles, incense, flowers, golden dragons, and silken banners—pledges of our destined lives—to attest and verify our cinnabar sincerity. Beginning at the midnight hour of [Day], we initiate the fast. Burning incense and pacing the Dao, we repent and give thanks to the Mystic Perfected. Kindling lamps to continue the light, we illuminate the Three Realms, reaching downward through the Nine Earths and upward to all heavens. We deliver the living and rescue the dead, universally benefiting household and state. For [Number] days and nights, we pace the Dao and recite the scriptures. At the eleventh hour of [Day], the merit is perfected and the task accomplished. The lotus lamps dim their flames, and the jade chimes gather their sound. The immortal chariots return to the Upper Mysteries, and the Dharma’s flow disperses through the lower realms. Golden dragons ascend in radiance to report the fast’s merit. The sagely grace extends compassion, opening deliverance to the hidden and the lost. Rewarding merit and bestowing honors, it universally reaches the numinous offices.\n\nWithin our bodies, the inner and outer Perfected Officials we bear, the soldiers and scribes of the Three Caverns, the stellar lodges and Nine Palaces, the Five Emperors, the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the troops and cavalry, the attendant incense-bearing Golden Lads, the flower-scattering Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans who transmit and report, and the Flying Dragon Cavalry—all have labored with merit.

      "translated_text": "Advancing or halting in violation of statutes, failing to conform to ritual propriety—we fear being impeached by the Four Offices or seized by the Five Emperors. For a thousand transgressions and ten thousand faults, we beseech pardon and forgiveness. Though our ignorance remains unenlightened, may no punishment be visited upon us.\n\nAt the commencement of this retreat, we reverently invited the Wisdom of the Highest Grade and performed the Ten Precepts Dharma rites, which now being concluded, we escort them back to the Heavenly Palace. The retreat we have conducted is now complete in merit and accomplishment. To further clarify these merits, we present a memorial on yellow silk with vermilion script.\n\nUpon our jade table, we request the inspection of the memorial text. The text is inscribed on five feet of fine yellow silk, with vermilion borders and vermilion script, each line containing twenty-four characters. No \"living\" character appears at the bottom of a line, nor any \"dead\" character at the top. The first line records the Dharma rank in full, concluding with the phrase \"bowing my head.\" The opening address occupies its own line. \"The Most High and Boundless Dao Lord\" appears on the third line. After \"the memorial is hereby presented,\" omit the supplicant’s surname for three lines. After the sacred title, again omit the surname for three lines. The date follows, separated from the sacred title by three lines. All must adhere strictly to the prescribed format, with no emendations—lest corrections incur reprimand, a matter of utmost gravity.\n\n**Reading the Memorial**\nTake the memorial from the incense burner, fumigate it, and begin reading. At the mention of the Dharma rank, bow twice, then resume the kneeling posture. Maintain a harmonious voice and upright qi. When the disciple’s name is read, bow twice again. From the phrase \"your servant, in trembling awe,\" bow twice more. At the date and place, bow once more, then bow twice again. When finished, spread the memorial upon the jade table, aligning it directly before the Celestial Presence. Secure it with a dragon-headed writing knife to the left of the sacred title and a vermilion brush to the right, then resume the kneeling posture. Light three pinches of incense, strike the teeth three times, and dispatch the memorial, issuing the decree:\n\nWe solemnly dispatch the Perfected Officials of the Five Constituents within our bodies, each accompanied by one minor clerk and twelve scribal assistants. We further command the Merit Officers, the Flying Dragon Cavalry, and the Courier Envoys to attire themselves in full regalia—crowns, sashes, pendants, inkstones, brushes, and girded swords—to prepare the records. Without delay, they shall bear this yellow-silk vermilion memorial to the Heavenly Bureaus and present it in audience. Should any errors occur—omissions, misplaced characters, disordered phrases, or improper sequencing—the transmitting scribes, attendant clerks, and their dragon-headed writing knives and long-haired brushes shall correct them on the spot. Let no supervising official have cause to return it.\n\nHolding the breath, ascend the memorial directly to the presence of the Most High and Boundless Dao Lord of the Three Heavens. Proceed without delay. The Left Lord shall pass through the gates, the Right Clerk shall announce in proper order. Each official shall proceed according to rank. May what we have requested descend, what we have summoned arrive, what we have healed be cured, what we have condemned be destroyed, what we have proclaimed be transmitted, what we have promoted advance, what we have wished be fulfilled, and what we have sought be obtained. Should any subordinate official dare obstruct or intercept this memorial, preventing its ascent, they shall be seized and delivered to the nearest prison, their crimes adjudicated according to celestial law to uphold the heavenly statutes.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves, awaiting the response of mysterious grace.\n\nThe Dharma Master, standing behind the table, closes his eyes and faces the Heavenly Gate, bowing deeply in visualization. The officials and soldiers within his body, along with the Generals of the Three Primes and the Merit Officers with their mounts, array themselves before and behind him. His body ascends in a feathered carriage, a dragon-drawn chariot, rising gently within the purple qi to the gate of the Three Heavens. First, he pays homage to the Dharma Masters of the Three Heavens, then enters the left gate of the Mysterious Capital Palace. After presenting the memorial, he bears the case directly into the Three Heavens Gate. Twelve attendants—those bearing the memorial, presenting it, and awaiting its review—stand in readiness. Upon completion, he exits the Three Heavens Gate, mounts his feathered carriage with his retinue, and returns. The passage through the heavenly palaces and celestial roads follows the same sequence as the memorial rites of the Three and Five Heavens—details of which are not repeated here.\n\nNext, the inner officials strike their teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:\nThe memorial having been presented, the Merit Officers, Courier Envoys, and Perfected Officials of the Three and Five Heavens who emerged from our body shall now return—entering through the Gate of Myriad Mysteries, those on the left returning to the left, those on the right to the right. The Directing Merit Officers and overseers shall resume their original positions, ensuring no confusion. When summoned again, they shall arrive as before.\n\nStrike the teeth twice, swallow the saliva twice. Visualize the officials of the Three and Five Heavens memorial rites returning to their places within the body. Bow twice, then roll the memorial into its case, sealing it with the true writ. Place it upon the incense table. The Cavern Tablet Officer shall bear it, the Retreat Supervisor shall escort it, with banners and regalia leading the way, the disciples following. At the Heavenly Gate, it is burned.\n\nThe Dharma Master, from his position, faces the Heavenly Gate and visualizes the Perfected Officials bearing the true-writ memorial ascending with the azure smoke and vermilion flames into the Heavenly Gate.\n\n**Burning the Memorial with Invocation**\nBeings are beset by obstacles and hardships,\nThe Great Dao shows profound compassion.\nSalvation and deliverance abide in precepts and rites,\nAll are enabled to repent their karmic entanglements.\nTransgressions are recorded in the earthly prisons,\nOffenses have reached the ears of Heaven.\nWe confess our faults and pray for true protection,\nOur sincerity reverently directed to the sages.\nDevoutly we worship the Three Treasures,\nPraying to present our memorial for longevity.\nThe burning words ascend to the upper realms,\nNames presented before the Jade Emperor.\n\nLight three pinches of incense, hold the Mountain Memorial Text, strike the teeth nine times, fumigate the text thrice, then read:\n\nWe, the humble Dharma disciple [official title, name, age], born under the governance of [Celestial Emperor], named in the register of [Marchmount], now residing in [prefecture, county, village], respectfully conduct this Yellow Register Grand Retreat of [number] days and nights at [prefecture, county, temple, abode] for the sake of the state, the household, the living and deceased kin, and [specific intention]. The Daoist rites now concluded, we cast this memorial upon the Sacred Mountain. May the divine and immortal ones, the perfected of the Five Marchmounts, most numinous and efficacious, erase our names from the ledgers of sin and inscribe them in the Nine Heavens. We beseech the Sacred Mountain to dispatch a golden dragon courier.\n\nIn the reign year [name], the [year] of the [Celestial Stem-Branch], the [month], the [day] of the [lunar phase], the Three Caverns Dharma Master [name], at the [Sacred Mountain Cavern Abode], hereby concludes this proclamation.",

hold fast to your resolve like metal and stone.\nPreserve the child and ascend the mysterious path; the Five Numinous Ones transmit the registers of passage.\nCross me through the practice of the Six Perfections, thus able to unbind the Three Nets.\nPurify the fast and worship the Primordial Simplicity;

its magnification lies in the hearts of all beings.\nLearning the Dao depends on sincere faith; serve the master as if they were your closest kin.\nDraw in the radiance and match the pure void; diligently follow the daily renewal.\nUntil all people are delivered, I will not deliver myself.\nGreat vows demand profound recompense; the mysterious virtue must surely be trusted.\nHidden evils and sins run deep; when faced, they turn like a wheel.\nLearning the Dao is also arduous; day and night, cultivate the field of blessings.\nPlanting virtue is like planting a tree; heaping baskets of earth makes a mountain.\nIf you can delight in the mysterious and esteem it, you will lightly ascend the azure heavens.\nCultivate this Dao of non-action, and you will form bonds with goodness.\nThe Supreme’s most recondite scripture is called the *Chapter of Wisdom*.\nRelief from suffering comes through great talent; transcendence of the worldly comes through true virtue.\nThe numinous countenance is rare in the world, gleaming like a lotus in the depths.\nEach person’s conduct has its root, all stemming from the merit of past lives.\nEstablish virtue while there is time; make vows, and none will go unanswered.\nGood and evil both await their response; the principle of rise and fall is unfathomable.\nThe worthy uphold the Dharma’s words; the Dao also lies in forgetting both.\nTo comprehend this is great wisdom, to become a Lord of the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe jeweled canopy connects to the jade chariot; the command is given to ride the nine dragons.\nThe Golden Flower holds aloft the *Cavern Scripture*; the immortal youths all bear incense.\nWhistling and singing resound through the Mystic Capital; jade chimes strike the jasper bells.\nThe body rises to the Supreme Clarity, transcending radiance to roam the Purple Empyrean.\nUphold the Dharma’s net and wander the ultimate mystery in freedom.\nTen thousand kalpas are like last night; a thousand springs are like the morning dawn.\nTowering, it shades the cloud blossoms; hands grasp the branches of the Treasure Grove.\nFragrant smoke arises naturally; the mysterious steps ascend in a whirlwind.\nThe numinous banners disperse with the wind; manifold thoughts dissolve in their time.\nExtinguish wisdom to magnify the great unity; non-action becomes the pure chant.\n\nAll the above is the same as the *Ritual of the Golden Register*.\n\n**Hymn to the Student of Immortality**\nLearning immortality is urgent;

they are not to be divulged to lesser immortals.\nSecretly hidden within the Golden Gates and Jade Chambers, they are fitting to transmit to those who cultivate the *Numinous Treasure Retreat*.\nThey must not be shown to frivolous and ostentatious people. Be cautious, be cautious.\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate Perfected said: The jade maidens and immortal youths who attend the scriptures, upon hearing these sounds of ritual, hymns, and praises, all rejoice and protect the practitioner’s body.\nThis great scripture should always be used with these hymns in worship.\nEven those who silently recite the scriptures should chant them in their hearts.\nThese are the secret words of the highest immortals, the wondrous sounds of the cultivators of truth.\n\nFrom the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Mystic Capital Jade Capital Mountain*, Chapter Three.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: The scriptures are my legacy, guiding the foolish and deluded, able to awaken the boundless Dao-mind in all beings.\nIntention arises from awakening; through awakening, one becomes true.\nAll sages in their cultivation ascend to the Dao’s fruit.\nThus, the Primordial Beginning, with one qi, generated and transformed the three qi, dividing them into the Three Heavens.\nThe first is the Primordial Qi, forming the Clear and Subtle Heaven, called the Jade Clarity Realm, where the Heavenly Treasure Lord manifests.\nAt the beginning of the Dragon Han kalpa, I was called the Formless Heavenly Worthy.

      "translated_text": "The Three Caverns’ Treasure Scriptures comprise thirty-six divisions, also termed the Three Vehicles. The *Cavern-Real Treasure Scriptures* are called the Great Vehicle; the *Cavern-Mystery Treasure Scriptures*, the Middle Vehicle; and the *Cavern-Spirit Treasure Scriptures*, the Lesser Vehicle. They are bound by the soaring qi of the Mysterious, naturally forming their chapters—jade characters in gold script, dragon patterns in phoenix seal-script. Their great expanse spans one zhang, with eight corners radiating brilliance. They teach and transform the heavens, circulating throughout the world. From beginning to end, through kalpas unending, they perpetually turn the Wheel of the Dao. Some are true, some expedient; some broad, some concise. Adapting to the faculties of beings, they guide cultivation in accord with the age. Though heaven and earth may end their course, the Three Caverns shall never perish. They open the path for all ranks, guiding humans and celestials alike. The Three Realms and Ten Directions all receive their benefit.\n\nAt the dawn of each kalpa, the *Cavern-Real* descends to transform the world. People embrace virtue and power, dwelling together in non-action. All uphold the Orthodox and Real, attaining long life and the Dao. Next, the *Cavern-Mystery* descends, and humanity gradually drifts apart. Simplicity scatters, purity thins, and the Dao is lost while virtue is betrayed. Finally, the *Cavern-Spirit* descends, and humanity grows ever more frivolous and insubstantial. They no longer uphold the Orthodox and Real, and their years and lives grow short. From this point onward, the human heart decays. The Three Caverns cease to circulate, and worldly wisdom flourishes day by day. Humans and spirits intermingle, and the kalpa’s span hastens toward its end. Before a hundred years pass, impermanence reigns in every thought. Death follows without cease. Thus, I re-emerge to proclaim and propagate the Three Caverns, disseminating their teachings among humankind. Adapting to the capacities of each age, I expound the scriptures—sometimes great, sometimes small—suited to the needs of beings.\n\nThus, the original texts of the Primordial Beginning were not fully transmitted below. In the Three Clarities’ upper realms and the Four Brahmā Heavens, the perfected and sages cultivate the Dao, and their texts are complete. Though mountains, rivers, grotto-palaces, seas, and peaks may have their own practices, these are not fully comprehensive. For the scriptures cultivated in each region, the Three Caverns cannot be entirely complete. Therefore, I commanded Laozi to incarnate in the human realm, to save and deliver all beings, and to expound the precepts and regulations. Whether among the Yi or the Xia, whether sage or commoner, throughout the Ten Directions, all are enabled to attain liberation. The wondrous Dharma of the Three Caverns is scattered among humankind. I exhort all men and women to diligently cultivate and practice.\n\nOrdinary beings accumulate sins, their karma weighing them down in delusion. Having no affinity with the Dao, they cannot believe or uphold it. They follow only false teachings, worshipping various heterodox spirits, vainly exhausting body and mind, only to descend into hell in the end. Those who believe and practice the Three Caverns all enter the Hall of Blessings. Some ascend in broad daylight, others attain liberation through corpse-transformation, concealing their traces in grotto-palaces and roaming the world. They attain long life, change their names, and endure through kalpas without end. Refining qi and transforming form, they turn spirit to enter the Dao. None can recognize them—their number is boundless.\n\nAfter my passing, demonic teachings will flourish. The world will uniformly follow them, and people will die young. War, flood, fire, disease, and injury will bring death and harm. Nations will fall, families will perish, and these calamities will follow one after another from dawn to dusk. Treasuries will be exhausted to serve demons and heresies. Falsehood and disorder will daily increase, and the age’s frivolity will spread like a fan. Hunger, cold, and suffering will afflict all, fathers and sons will be scattered and displaced. The world will grow ever more foolish, never to awaken.\n\nI pity you, who have sunk through kalpas uncounted. Thus, I speak these essential words to enlighten the deaf and blind. Yet the wondrous Dharma of the Three Caverns comprises two kinds: the first is the True Dharma, the second the Transformative Dharma. The True Dharma transcends all falsity and endures through kalpas without end. The Transformative Dharma, conveyed through written words, changes and perishes with the times.\n\nWithin the Transformative Dharma, there are five varieties:\n1. The soaring qi of the Mysterious coalesces into cloud-seal script, forming chapters naturally. Their transformations are unfathomable, appearing and vanishing unpredictably. They abide in the upper realms of the Three Clarities, eternally guarding the scriptures. Through kalpas uncounted, they endure, protected by sages and perfected beings.\n2. The numinous script spans one zhang, its eight corners radiant. Throughout the Three Realms and Ten Directions, in the heavens’ five hundred million realms, they rise and fall with the kalpas, circulating in response to karmic conditions.\n3. In the palaces, towers, pavilions, and chambers of the heavens, between gates and doorways, they are inscribed and chanted. They subdue beings and guide their entry and exit in cultivation.\n4. Flower-patterned characters and leaf-script, jade tablets and jasper-bound volumes. On the square zhang of Penglai, in the Langfeng and Mysterious Garden, they appear and vanish unpredictably, enduring or perishing with the kalpas. They teach and train immortals, subduing demonic spirits.\n5. Written on paper, silk, bamboo, wood, and lacquer, they circulate among humankind, transmitted and chanted. At the kalpa’s dawn, they descend; at its end, they ascend. They protect nations, pacify people, and liberate all ranks.\n\nThe scriptures are the words of the Primordial Beginning, teaching and transforming all beings. They enable recognition of the root and origin, past-life karmic conditions, the retribution of sins and blessings, the auspices of good and evil. They reveal the gateways of birth and transformation, the sources of expedient means. Now, turn from evil and follow goodness, preserving and pacifying your nature and life. Attain long life and non-action, returning to the Dao. This is the eternal model. Those who preserve it receive blessings; those who cultivate it become immortals.\n\nFrom the *Sutra of Karmic Retribution and Karmic Conditions*.\n\nThe Supreme Dao Lord addressed the Three Heavens’ Dharma Master, saying: The Heavenly Worthy’s teachings and precepts, the wondrous texts of the Three Caverns—celestial script in jade characters, cloud-seal and dragon-patterned chapters—though boundless, can be summarized and categorized. Though divided into twelve divisions by type, they adapt to differing faculties. They are:\n1. Natural Original Texts\n2. Divine Talismans\n3. Treasure Instructions\n4. Numinous Diagrams\n5. Registers and Genealogies\n6. Precepts and Vinaya\n7. Ritual Propriety\n8. Methods and Techniques\n9. Arts and Calculations\n10. Biographies and Records\n11. Hymns and Eulogies\n12. Memorials and Petitions\n\nThe Natural Original Texts—celestial script in the Eight Assemblies, phoenix-seal and dragon-patterned chapters—are the root of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. They transform humans and spirits, establishing all Dharmas. They summon the Nine Heavens, the immortals, and the Celestial Thearchs. They verify and rectify registers and diagrams, adjusting the turning of the celestial sphere. They subdue Fengdu, vanquish demons, and subjugate spirits. They command the Water Thearch, summon dragons to ascend the clouds. They govern the kalpic cycles of heaven and earth, the names and titles of sages and perfected beings. They oversee the terraces and cities, the realms of the host of perfected.",

They regulate the rhythms of bowing and rising, the norms for posture and bearing.\n\nMethods comprise the writings of the host of sages—esoteric essentials of elixirs and medicines, divine herbs and sacred fungi, the arts of refining gold, water, and jade for cultivation.\n\nNumerology and calculations clarify and discern the spirit, preserving the true and contemplating the Dao. Through fasting of the heart and sitting in forgetfulness, one roams the void and strides through the air. Ingesting the six qi and guiding the three luminaries, refining the substance and transforming the form, they are the methods of immortal transcendence.\n\nBiographies and records are the accounts of the host of sages, documenting their studies. Attaining the Dao and achieving perfection, penetrating the mysterious and entering the wondrous, they detail the places of cultivation and the times of fruition.\n\nHymns and eulogies are the artfully adorned dharma-words of the host of perfected and great sages. Extolling the true Dao, they inspire universal faith and joy, arousing dedication and fostering reverence.\n\nMemorials and petitions are the wondrous treasures and marvelous texts transmitted between master and disciple.

      "translated_text": "Dispelling malevolent influences and sweeping away demonic disturbances, the realm was brought to tranquility. By the years of the Kaiyuan era, scriptures and their oral transmissions began to flourish anew. Emperor Xuanzong compiled the *Celestial Net Scripture Catalogue*, totaling 7,300 scrolls. Additionally, there was the *Jade Latitude Supplementary Catalogue*, which recorded commentaries, treatises, and discourses, together amounting to over 9,000 scrolls. Soon after, the two Hu peoples invaded and disrupted the Central Kingdom, and the true teachings declined. The secret repositories of the two capitals were largely consumed by flames. In the first year of the Shangyuan era, the collected scriptures and registers numbered over 6,000 scrolls. By the Dali era, Master Shenfu, scouring the realm for texts and transcribing them in the capital, amassed another 7,000 scrolls. After the Changqing era and into the Xiantong period, the two streets’ transcriptions barely reached 5,300 scrolls. Recently, as great bandits violated the land and the imperial carriage fled south, the two capitals were shrouded in smoke and ash, the six directions overgrown with brambles. The true palaces and Daoist abbeys everywhere fell into ruin, and the jade-bound scriptures and jasper cases were reduced to less than a third. Amidst these dire times, I drifted to Chengdu. Though I followed the imperial retinue in selecting a new capital, my stay was brief. Again, I sought to gather texts, enduring hardships in the process. The old and new scriptures and edicts barely numbered 3,000 scrolls, yet remained uncollated. Soon after, as the court toured the provinces, the acquired scriptures were once more lost. Returning to the Three Shu regions, I wished to resume my search, but the successive military campaigns of my ancestors thwarted my earlier aspirations. Now, in the second year of the Dashun era, the eighth month, the third day of the gengchen cycle, at the Jade Bureau of Transformation in Chengdu, reviewing and examining the regulations and teachings, I set down these brief notes.\n\n*Concluding the Fifty-Second Scroll of the* Highest Clarity Yellow Register Retreat Rites\n*Beginning the Fifty-Third Scroll of the* Highest Clarity Yellow Register Retreat Rites",

      "translated_text": "Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting, abridged:\n\nThe scriptures and regulations all state: among the officiants of the retreat, the one of highest moral stature is designated as the *Fashi* (Dharma Master). The one well-versed in the rites and regulations serves as *Dujian* (Chief Lector).\n\nThe *Dujian*’s official liturgical text further states: first sound the Dharma drum, then lead the assembly of companions. Let conduct follow proper form, and reverence rely upon the recitations. This—reciting, chanting, and guiding—constitutes the *Dujian*’s duties.\n\nIn the regions of Jiangbiao in Wu, and between Ke and Chu, the *Dujian* holds the chime-stone to direct the rites and lead the ceremonies. The phrase “first sound the Dharma drum” refers to the bells and chime-stones, intended to ensure that all officiants are solemnly aligned, their deportment stern and ordered. One must first strike the chime-stone to unify the assembly, then recite and chant as they ascend the altar—this, too, is the *Dujian*’s responsibility.\n\nYet in recent years, when the *Dujian* is of advanced age or virtue, and reluctance arises to burden them with every task, one person from among the officiants is appointed to hold the chime-stone and intone the rites. Though this arises from immediate necessity, it is not an ancient institution. Upon examination, such delegation of duty is a dereliction of office.\n\nMoreover, some later students, acting on their own whims, have arbitrarily appointed an additional person to hold the chime-stone, creating a position outside the six offices without any canonical basis. The error deepens further.\n\nThe *Gaogong Fashi* (High Merit Dharma Master) holds the duty of presenting petitions and proclamations. Their movements and bearing lead the assembly. Should age or infirmity render them unfit, they may seek retirement—how can they delegate their role and thus proliferate superfluous personnel?\n\nIn present-day Shu, the *Gaogong*’s duties are confined to invoking and sealing the incense burners, announcing their name and rank twice. All other proclamations are entrusted to others. Though they may chant first while others follow, how does this differ from a dragon’s roar met by a turtle’s echo? Such conduct invites karmic retribution and self-incurred blame. If human affairs cannot tolerate it, how can the Dao of Heaven respond in kind? Future masters of the rites must take heed: do not pursue immediate convenience, lest you compound your sins in the hereafter.\n\nThe *Jianzhai* (Retreat Supervisor) upholds the regulations and statutes, correcting transgressions and deviations. Their duty lies in impartiality, adhering to canonical law. Should any violation occur, they must issue a written reprimand. The offender, too, must accept punishment willingly.\n\nThe aim is that, outwardly, rites may be observed to preserve the solemnity of the assembly, while inwardly, one remains free of self-deception, avoiding lingering regret. During the process of correction, there must be no clamor or dispute. The one upholding the law must proceed with proper protocol; the guilty must not evade or resist. Such conduct not only offends the sages of the unseen realm but also invites ridicule from the assembly.\n\nNext, the *Shijing* (Scripture Attendants) maintain order in the altar space, overseeing the Dharma seat and the lecterns for scriptures and regulations. They arrange offerings, supplies, and furnishings, ensuring all is properly inspected.\n\nFormerly, within the retreat hall, two high seats were installed for the three daily sessions of lecturing and recitation. Thus, the *Jianyi* (Simplified Rites) states: “Three sessions of lecturing and chanting.” The *Zhijian* (Office Regulations) further states: “Guard the two lion seats.” The *Fajian* (Penalty Regulations) stipulates: “Those listening to the scriptures must not lean or rely on anything, nor hold tablets.” It also states: “Inquire about faulty verses.” These all clarify that, after the ritual proceedings conclude, the Dharma Master and officiants engage in the three daily sessions of lecturing and recitation.\n\nIn recent practice, however, the three daily rites are conducted solely within the altar space, with three sessions of circumambulation and three of scripture recitation. The tradition of lecturing and chanting has long faded, and the two high seats are no longer set up.\n\nDuring scripture recitation, the officiants take their seats. One attendant carries the purifying water, another tends the incense, and another handles the scriptures. After the recitation concludes, the *Shijing* retrieves the scriptures and returns them to their proper place, then arranges and sweeps the altar space, preparing for the offerings. They must ensure that outsiders do not trespass upon or defile the sacred altar—this is the *Shijing*’s duty.\n\nThey must not neglect their responsibilities, nor act with arrogance or irreverence. They must not allow lecterns to lie askew in the altar space, nor permit offerings to be soiled or mixed with profane items. They must not permit servants or laborers to enter the altar, thus offending the divine and transgressing the precepts.\n\nAfter the altar is sealed, passage is forbidden—yet servants, cooks, and attendants casually come and go. Such practices are common and must be strictly prohibited. Should they persist, the *Shijing* will bear the blame and punishment.\n\nThe duties of the *Shixiang* (Incense Attendants) are outlined in the liturgical texts. Yet in recent times, negligence has prevailed, and diligence has waned. Not only does the incense smoke often cease, but the fire frequently dies, leaving the ashes cold. Moreover, before the *Gaogong* has even ascended the altar, some officiants presumptuously add incense. Such deviations are widespread and must be corrected upon review of the rites and regulations.\n\nThe *Shideng* (Lamp Attendants) must remain diligent, ensuring the lamps are lit according to the rites, burning through the night and rekindled at dawn—only then do they fulfill their duty. Yet some unlearned and shallow individuals, instead of having the *Shijing* maintain the altar, have arbitrarily established a position called *Zhitan* (Altar Attendant), creating a superfluous role outside the six offices. Enlightened Dharma Masters should reject such innovations, lest they tread false paths and invite the scorn of future sages.\n\nFurthermore, according to the ancient rites of the *Jinlu* (Golden Register) and the old regulations of the *Huanglu* (Yellow Register), on the night of the preliminary invocation and during the declaration of merits, a *Ziran Chao* (Natural Audience) is first conducted before proceeding with the retreat rites. Thus, the *Qizhai Yi* (Retreat Invocation Rites) states: “The officiants, in succession, first perform the Natural Audience. After the Three Bows, they report to the retreat office, recite the precepts, and proclaim the regulations. At dawn the following day, they proceed with the rites according to the proper method.”\n\nThis practice has been transmitted from Master Zhang of Heaven, Master Lu, Master Kou of Heaven, and Master Zhang Qingdu, down to the present, spanning many generations. All regard the retreat rites as deriving from the *Lingbao* (Numinous Treasure) tradition, with the Natural Audience as the ancestral foundation of the retreat. Thus, it is performed first to demonstrate that the origin is not forgotten.\n\nYet some ignorant Daoists, failing to comprehend the intent of the ancient sages, first appoint the six offices and proclaim the regulations before the *Xuanshi* (Mystic Master), then ascend the altar, falsely claiming adherence to the retreat rites of Master Jianji. Their errors and distortions, their slanderous and illogical arguments, reveal a profound lack of understanding. Even worse, they have followers who imitate such practices.",

      "translated_text": "Not only do they incur the transgression of disordering the rites, but they also bear the sin of slandering the worthy. Those of discerning teaching should jointly reject such practices.\n\nAmong the old rites, there are transmitted errors: only at the moment of declaring the retreat’s merit, during the Natural Audience, should one pay homage to the *Lingbao Heavenly Worthy*. Yet the transmitted practice has been to pay homage to the *Jade Treasure August Supreme* and the like—this slightly deviates from the original intent of the Natural Audience. Perhaps due to the passage of long ages, scribal errors have crept in. In this ritual, corrections have now been made, not out of presumption, but as dictated by reason. May later worthies and those of the present age together propagate this.\n\n**Ritual Procedures for the Retreat Altar’s Chants and Responses**\n\nOn the night of the retreat’s commencement, the assembled officers take their positions before the *Mystic Master*. One is appointed to read the office assignments. Another leads the retreat sponsor to bow twice before the *Mystic Master*. Then, three pinches of incense are offered. After bowing twice more, the sponsor holds the petition case and states the retreat’s purpose. Having completed the statement, the sponsor bows again while holding the case, then turns, kneels, and presents the petition to the *High Merit*. After receiving the case, the retreat sponsor bows, and the *High Merit* returns the bow before retiring to his original position.\n\nNext, the *High Merit* holds the petition case before the *Mystic Master*. Three offerings of incense are made, followed by three bows. Holding the case upright, the *High Merit* formally announces the retreat’s commencement to the *Retreat Assembly*. Then, the *Three Refuges* are chanted. The *Assembly Leader* chants the *Universal Invocation*. The *Hua-Xia* guide leads the procession to the *Three Officials’* altar, where incense is offered. Then, to the *Three Masters’* altar, where incense is offered. The retreat officers are then invited to stand. The guide leads them to the *Earth Gate* and the *Prohibited Altar*. The *Gate-Incantation* is recited, and at the *Celestial Gate*, incense is offered to the *Ten Directions*. They return to their positions.\n\nThe *Assembly Leader* chants, and each officer bows to the masters while maintaining meditative focus as prescribed. The *Dharma Drum* is struck twenty-four times.

      "translated_text": "Guangting said: In ancient times, when the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning had already divided the Primal Chaos, the Three Qi unfolded the cosmic pattern. From the primordial essence of the Great Dao—the True One’s qi—were transformed the Numinous Treasure. The Red Writ coagulated into script, descending upon the Five Directions to pacify and stabilize heaven and earth, and to summon the perfected and the numinous. Thus it is said: heaven and earth receive it to be pacified and stabilized; sun and moon receive it to shine with radiance; ghosts and spirits receive it to be delivered and enlightened; and the people receive it to attain longevity. The True Writ has been bequeathed to the world: above, it dissolves celestial calamities and safeguards the emperors; below, it wards off poisonous harm and delivers the multitudes. It subdues gods and demons, rescues the sunken and drowning, and accomplishes all without exception. As the scripture says: “Without the Writ, there is no illumination; without the Writ, there is no clarity; without the Writ, there is no establishment; without the Writ, there is no completion; without the Writ, there is no deliverance; without the Writ, there is no life.” It is also said: “The Red Writ of Jade Characters and the Eight Mighty Dragon Script preserve and regulate the kalpic destiny, ensuring the heavens endure forever.” Such are the wondrous functions of the Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure and the True Writ. Thus they rectify the celestial divisions and harmonize yin and yang; deliver the flying souls and protect the emperors; rescue the drowning and aid the submerged; bridge the hidden and the manifest; reconcile grievances and absolve transgressions; avert death and prolong life. The sufferings of life and death are all saved without exception.\n\nWhen establishing a retreat, the True Writ and Jade Characters are installed to pacify the Five Directions. Upon the conclusion of the altar rites, the Writ is gathered and burned. The ashes are scattered amidst the azure smoke, all in accordance with the Jade Instructions. Should a scholar-practitioner cultivate the Real and seek deliverance for themselves, inscribing their name in the registers of immortality, they shall forever depart the ghostly realms. On the days of the Three Primes, the Eight Nodes, the jiazi, or their own life-destiny day, they shall inscribe the Writ upon jade tablets and cast them into renowned mountains, thereby erasing the karmic ledgers of past lives. Their names ascend to heaven, and each matter is thrice presented before the heavens. The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus record their meritorious deeds. Above, they are distinguished by the heavens; ten thousand spirits revere and protect them; the Five Emperors attend them; and the Three Realms’ administrators welcome them. A thousand demons and ten thousand spirits dare not rashly intrude. As the scripture says: “With resolve firm and unwavering, all endeavors toward the Dao shall succeed.” Seven generations of ancestors ascend to the celestial palaces, and the blessings of life and death respond in kind.\n\n**First Talisman: The Azure Emperor of the East, Command of the Numinous Treasure True Writ**\nThe Jade Characters of the East, twenty-four in number. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, scholar-practitioners shall inscribe them in vermilion and carry them, or cast them into renowned mountains. The Nine Qi of the East commence with the August Azure Heaven. Amidst the verdant mists and towering ramparts dwells an Elder who oversees the celestial registers and summons qi to elevate immortals.\n\nAnother thirty-two characters govern the advent of baleful stars. Inscribed in vermilion upon azure paper and exposed in the courtyard for nine days, they dissolve calamities when carried. For the cultivation of the Yellow Register, they pacify the East. Proceed according to the following incantation:\n\nThe Year Star assists the liver; Horn and Neck stabilize the Real.\nRoot, Chamber, Heart, and Tail revolve through the four seasons.\nWinnowing Basket governs the seven luminaries; the Northern Dipper’s wheel turns bright.\nReceiving qi, it captures the false and sweeps away calamitous hosts.\n\nAnother thirty-two characters subdue demonic spirits. Inscribed in vermilion upon black paper and faced toward the northeast, they cause demons to vanish and ghosts to submit. Proceed according to the incantation.\n\nThe Eastern Mountain’s divine incantation summons the Nine Heavens.\nThe Red Writ’s talismanic command convenes Fengdu.\nBinding demons and dispatching ghosts, all slain shall not escape.\nAll shall be sent to the Wooden Palace; none dare delay.\n\nAnother thirty-two characters govern the summoning of the Eastern Sea’s Water Emperor. In times of great floods or when crossing vast waters, call forth dragons and subdue spirits by inscribing in yellow upon azure paper. Proceed according to the incantation, then cast the Writ into the water to traverse the calamity. The River Earl shall welcome you; below, it commands the Eastern River and the oceanic water spirits. In the great kalpic deluge, dragons shall bear you. The water palaces open paths, a thousand roads and ten thousand passages. The Red Writ of the Most High is unobstructed by wind or fire.\n\n**Second Talisman: The Vermilion Emperor of the South, Command of the Numinous Treasure True Writ**\nThe Jade Characters of the South, thirty-two in number, govern the registers of divine immortals. On the day of the Beginning of Summer, the jiazi, or their life-destiny day, scholar-practitioners shall inscribe the Writ in vermilion upon tablets and cast them into renowned mountains. Their names shall enter the immortal registers, and they shall attain long life as divine immortals.\n\nThe Cinnabar Heaven of the South, the Jade Hall of the Vermilion Emperor. Within dwells a great spirit named the Vermilion Sovereign. Above, calamitous vapors disperse; the Three Qi surge with radiance. Divine immortals receive their mandate, responding to the Great Yang.\n\nAnother thirty-two characters govern the summoning of the southern constellations. Employ them to avert calamities of transformation and to pacify the Yellow Register retreat altars. Inscribed in vermilion upon azure paper, they restore the celestial patterns, and heavenly calamities dissolve of themselves.\n\nMars assists the heart; Well and Ghost guard Chamber.\nWillow, Star, Spread, and Wing resist the four quarters.\nChariot governs the seven lodges, revolving the celestial constants.\nSummoning and hastening conjunctions, the true path proceeds apace.\n\nAnother forty characters govern the subduing of celestial demons and spirits. Inscribed in yellow upon red wooden slips, they cause demons and spirits to submit and vanish. Proceed according to the incantation.\n\nThe Red Writ commands the numinous, northward subduing Fengdu.\nSwiftly dispatch demonic lineages, severing and extinguishing their perverse roots.\nThe talismanic tally exacts retribution, clearly enumerating their transgressions.\nThe Southern Mountain’s divine incantation overawes the eight directions.\nHosts of demons vanish; myriad trials are shattered and destroyed.\n\nAnother forty-eight characters govern the subduing of water calamities. Summon the Southern Sea’s Water Emperor and the myriad dragon spirits. Inscribed in yellow upon azure paper, the water officials shall welcome you.\n\nThe Southern Sea’s Water Emperor, the Dragon King Great Elder.\nThe divine incantation flows forth, universally sweeping away inauspiciousness.\nFlying calamities of floodwaters summon dragons above.\nWaterways are opened, a thousand paths and ten thousand passages.\nDare any resist? They shall be seized and sent to the Fire Palace.\nNone disobey the Red Writ’s proclamation.\n\n**Third Talisman: The Yellow Emperor of the Center, Command of the Numinous Treasure True Writ**\nThe Jade Characters of the Center, forty in number, govern the registers of divine immortals. On the jiazi of their life-destiny day, or the days of the spring equinox, autumn equinox, summer solstice, or winter solstice, scholar-practitioners shall inscribe them in vermilion and ingest them, or cast them into renowned mountains. Their names shall enter the immortal registers.",

      "translated_text": "On the day the calamity appears, inscribe the true writ according to its method and expose it in the central courtyard, facing the afflicted direction. For instance, if the star resides in the east—among the Horn and Neck’s seven lodges—face east and recite the incantation, exposing the writ for nine days. Proceed likewise for other directions. Strike the teeth twelve times, loosen the hair, and lift the head. The incantation reads:\n\nThe Primordial of the Upper Heavens, the Three Luminaries’ radiant clarity,\nrevolves its light to illumine the four directions in profound purity.\nWhere the celestial cycles clash, meteors surge in streaming brilliance;\nthe five divisions transgress, the three norms lose their peace.\nThe Five Ladles govern the stars, the seven lodges gleam with numinous power.\nThe True Lord, Great Luminary—his sacred name is Jade Purity.\nThe Lady, Empress of Humankind, is styled Nurturer of Infants.\nTogether they oversee the Mystic Pass, revolving all the heavens.\nNow a guest-calamity arrives, mystically announcing the inauspicious.\nWe present the true writ in vermilion script, loosen our hair in atonement,\nand bare our crimson sincerity.\nMay the Mystic Mirror witness this: restore the celestial norm,\nlet qi not stray wantonly, let calamities not arise without cause.\nBurn the numinous writ, scatter its smoke in the Jade Court.\nThe Upper Radiance surveys the degrees, universally notifying the myriad spirits.\nQi purifies the Three Passes, calamities vanish in the Nine Darknesses.\nYin and yang harmonize, the land knows great peace.\nHaving dispatched this via the Golden Dragon’s wind-and-fire courier,\nexpose the true writ in the central courtyard, where the Golden Dragon shall guard it.\nIf the calamity lies in the east—referring to the Horn and Neck’s seven lodges—\ncomplete nine days and nights, then burn the writ and scatter its ashes amid the blue smoke.\n\nFor all rites to dispel celestial calamities and pacify state and people, each method follows the afflicted direction.\nLight lamps to illumine the myriad heavens: if the calamity lies in the east, light nine lamps—or ninety, or nine hundred.\nUse one Golden Dragon and ninety bolts of blue silk, performing the rite for nine days and nights.\nIf the calamity lies in the south, light three lamps—or thirty, or three hundred—\none Golden Dragon, and thirty bolts of crimson silk, performing the rite for three days and nights.\nIf the calamity lies in the center, light twelve lamps—or one hundred twenty, or one thousand two hundred—\none Golden Dragon, and one hundred twenty bolts of yellow silk, performing the rite for twelve days and nights.\nThe center refers to the Celestial Market, the Supreme Subtlety, and the Purple Tenuity Palaces.\nIf the calamity lies in the west, light seven lamps—or seventy, or seven hundred—\none Golden Dragon, and seventy bolts of white silk, performing the rite for seven days and nights.\nIf the calamity lies in the north, light five lamps—or fifty, or five hundred—\none Golden Dragon, and fifty bolts of black silk, performing the rite for five days and nights.\nThe rest follows the *Upper Prime Statutes of the Primordial Numinous Treasure*.\nThe Yellow Register Fast is regularly practiced in accordance with this method.\n\nThe Primordial Numinous Treasure’s Five Elders summon and subdue the demonic hordes of the Northern Feng.\nThe Vermilion Script’s Upper Writ states:\nThose who receive the Numinous Treasure’s supreme method entice divine luminaries to descend.\nThrough concentrated visualization, their resonance reaches the heavens, enabling communion with celestial perfected.\nFirst distinguish the forms of demonic hordes:\nblock their trials and tests, subdue their demonic essence.\nThrough visualization, self-cultivation, and resonance, divine luminaries are readily summoned.\nTo perform this method, follow the true writ’s instructions.\nFace the northeast and strike the teeth thirty-six times—the northeast is the Demon Gate.\nFor grave illnesses, pestilences, or malevolent apparitions arising wantonly,\nperform the fast and writ-installation rites in the northeast of the state, capital, commandery, or territory.\nPractice with concentrated mind: demonic hordes will be crushed and subdued, the state pacified, the people tranquilized.\nHold the breath for nine cycles, then lift the head and recite:\nThe Three Primes unfold clarity, revolving the celestial constant.\nAs the cycles’ reckoning concludes, the Hundred-Six seizes the net.\nAt the great kalpa’s convergence, myriad demons contend in motion.\nThe Northern Feng is unrestrained, releasing its demonic lineage.\nHordes of demons rampage, malevolence obscures the celestial light.\nThe August Emperor commands, universally notifying the ten directions.\nHe elucidates the celestial degrees, expands the dharma’s teachings.\nThe true Dao governs the people, subjugating and dispelling the inauspicious.\nWhat petty demons dare assemble in throngs?\nThe Vermilion Script’s jade writ restrains and seizes the demonic realm.\nThe Three Officials of the Northern Feng swiftly transmit the decree.\nA thousand warriors bind their vigor, ten thousand demons surrender their forms.\nFlowing bells interweave their brilliance, stirring the qi of the Great Yang.\nGolden Tigers patrol the four quarters, Celestial Warriors capture the fugitive.\nGreat and small assemble together, none may hide or evade.\nThe Primordial’s proclamation is presented to the Upper Palaces.\nHold the breath for a long while, awaiting the resonance of what has been summoned.\nDistinguish the true forms of the numinous spirits, visualize and resonate with their efficacy.\nDo not speak of this, lest the work be undone.\n\nThe Primordial’s Five Elders dispel the great kalpa’s floodwaters,\nsummon the flood dragons and water palaces, and transmit the true writ’s jade formula for averting calamity.\nThe Dao declares:\nWhen the great kalpa’s calamity befalls heaven and earth, floodwaters surge from all directions,\nscouring filth and eradicating evil, leaving none behind.\nAt such times, heaven and earth merge in darkness, the people drift without distinction of good or ill.\nOnly those devoted scholars who obtain the Numinous Treasure’s true writ—\nthe talismans for great and

      "translated_text": "Master Guangcheng of the Tang, Du Guangting, *Ritual for Offering Dragon and Jade Disc* – *Lingxian Section of the Lower Yuan Huanglu Writs* states:\n\nTo deliver beings from the roots of sin, once all fasts and rites of majestic decorum are complete, follow the Red Writs and Jade Formulas, inscribe cinnabar upon the *jin* tablets, bind them with golden dragons and blue-green silk, and present them to the numinous mountains and Five Peaks. The pledge of ascension shall be sealed within the recesses of sheer cliffs. All must accord with the prescribed method.\n\n*Lingxian Section of the Lower Yuan Huanglu Writs* states:\n\nWhen the rites invoking the Five Thearchs’ majesty are complete, take one cinnabar-inscribed jade tablet and one golden dragon, bind them with blue-green silk, and cast them into the Three Rivers to present to the Water Thearch. The pledge of ascension must fully adhere to the jade formulas and written statutes.\n\n*Lingxian Section of the Lower Yuan Huanglu Writs* states:\n\nWhen the rites for the Water Thearch are complete, take nine jade tablets, golden dragons, and golden knots, bind them with blue-green silk, and bury them at the altar site to report and covenant with the Earth Officials. All must follow the regulations as stated.\n\n*Zhenxian Section of the Upper Yuan Jinlu Writs* states:\n\nTo deliver beings from the bonds of life and death, when the fast’s rites of majestic decorum are observed, place five golden dragons atop the True Writs of the Five Directions. Upon completion, cast them into the mountains and waters.\n\n*Lingxian Section of the Lower Yuan Huanglu Writs* states:\n\nFor the rites of majestic decorum to deliver beings from the roots of sin, use refined gold to fashion ten golden dragons to guard the Ten Directions. To deliver the flying souls, place one dragon at each of the ten directions.\n\n*Yugui Mingzhen Ke* states:\n\nWhen performing the precious Huanglu fast, use three *liang* of refined gold to cast three dragons, each weighing one *liang*. The state employs refined gold; dukes, ministers, and high officials use secondary gold; scholars, commoners, and the people may use silver, copper, or gilded substitutes, supplemented with jade tablets (the *yu zha*). Inscribe upon them the purpose of the fast, the state’s name, the year of the Great Year, the month and day, the Dharma master’s name, and the location of the offering. Cast them into renowned mountains and grottoes, numinous springs and dragon caves, or at the fast’s altar or dwelling place to report and covenant with the Three Bureaus of Heaven, Earth, and Water, allowing them to witness and verify the fast’s merit. Should any be omitted, the Nine Departments of the Earth Officials shall hold them accountable.\n\nThe regulations state: The dragon rides the clouds and qi, governs yin and yang. When united, it forms a body; when dispersed, it becomes patterns. Its transformations are unfathomable—it enters the earth and ascends to heaven. Thus, in the Thirty-Six Heavens, the realm of utmost yang, it serves as the courier to transmit messages and communicate with the mysterious and numinous. Is there anything but the dragon that can achieve this? The dragon is a yang creature. Of all things used by heaven, none surpasses the dragon; of those used by earth, none surpasses the tortoise; of those used by humans, none surpasses the horse. Therefore, the heavens employ dragons as their couriers, traversing between the heavens and the human realm. Gold, the noblest of the five metals, is unyielding and incorruptible—a treasure of heaven and earth that communicates with the numinous and harmonizes with the divine. Thus, refined gold is used to cast them in the dragon’s form. Cast into grottoes and palaces, they serve as pledges to covenant with the Three Primes. The true officials of the grottoes and palaces, along with their subordinate offices, receive the dragon pledges and written tablets, record the meritorious deeds, and memorialize them to the Most High Sages. The response to resonance is like a shadow following form. Those who cultivate and uphold these rites must not omit them.\n\nThe regulations state: The tablet (*jian*) serves to report, record, and inscribe. It records the world’s good deeds and reports them to the Perfected Ones. Its length is one *chi* and two *cun*, symbolizing the twelve earthly branches. Its width is two *cun* and four *fen*, corresponding to the twenty-four true qi. Its thickness is two *fen*, representing the Two Modes (yin and yang). Its top and bottom are square, symbolizing the sun’s square shadow. It is upright and unobstructed, yielding to nothing. The state uses jade for its tablets, for jade possesses nine virtues and may be used to ritualize heaven and earth. As a pledge to the divine spirits, jade is thus employed. Dukes, ministers, and commoners all use *jin* wood, for its purity and fine texture may be likened to jade, clarifying the distinctions of rank.\n\nThe regulations state: The jade disc (*bi*) is the treasure used to ritualize heaven, earth, and mountains and rivers, and is made of jade. When offering to mountains and rivers, use one round disc. Its color is azure, its diameter three *cun*, with a hollow center. The mountain tablet serves as a pledge to the Nine Heavens, so an azure disc is used, symbolizing heaven. When offering to water tablets, use a six-pointed disc. Its color is black, its diameter three *cun*, with a hollow center. The water tablet serves as a pledge to the Nine Seas and Water Officials, so a dark disc is used, representing the color of water. The six points correspond to the number of water. When offering to earth tablets, use a yellow disc. It is square, with a diameter of two *cun* and a hollow center. The earth tablet serves as a pledge to the Nine Lands. Yellow is the color of earth, and square is the shape of earth. The disc and dragon accompany the sealed tablet, bound with blue-green silk.\n\nThe regulations state: For the method of casting the three tablets, use nine golden knots to accompany the tablets. For three tablets, twenty-seven knots are used. The golden knots replace the blood oath, and the blue-green silk replaces the cutting of hair. To forge a covenant and convey sincerity, nothing is more weighty. Thus, the blue-green silk binds the knots, disc, tablet, and dragon before casting them. For the state, gold is used for the knots; for ministers and commoners, silver or copper gilded in gold may suffice. The knots have a diameter of nine *fen*, with their outer edges rounded like rings.\n\nThe regulations state: Upon completing the fast, select an auspicious day, or a day of purity during the fast. Prepare offerings, feasts, and ritual implements for the Dharma master, officials, and the fast’s host and disciples. Either board a boat to reach water grottoes or ascend by land to mountain gates. Outside the grottoes and palaces, clear the grass, sweep, and purify the area, then arrange the ritual mats, wine, fruits, delicacies, venison, broth, and tea. The state uses sixty-four portions; ministers and commoners use twenty-four. Follow the solemn ritual decorum: don ceremonial robes, bathe, and pay homage to the ritual proceedings, adhering strictly to the prescribed forms. The local divine officials and supervising generals shall act as intermediaries, reporting to the immortal offices within the grottoes to communicate the fast’s tablets. Thus, blessings and good fortune shall swiftly manifest. Do not fail to report and simply cast the tablets into the grottoes, for without reaching the true numina, one shall incur punishment instead. If the mountain or water grottoes are distant and the master and assembly cannot all attend or ascend, select one or two ritual officers from the altar, along with disciples, to carry the tablets to the grottoes. Perform the offerings and reports as in the original ritual.",

      "translated_text": "The furnace is restored. Upon concluding the *Primary School of Immortals’ Hymns*, disperse this earthen tablet. On the night of merit’s proclamation, after the recitation of incantations and hymns, by dawn it may be buried within the altar—no further petition or announcement is required. Here, following the rites of Master Zhang Chengguang, three tablets are presented for petition, each corresponding to a distinct true rank; thus, they are recorded again.\n\nIf within the altar of the purification fast, only the proclamation of merit is made, and at the time of the libation the incantation is recited, the tablet may then be cast. As for the mountain and water tablets, though proclaimed with the merit’s announcement and the incantation concluded, if a libation is set at the grotto’s site, one must proceed in proper sequence: each is recited, sealed with incantation, and then cast. This ensures completeness; one must not, having petitioned within the altar, proceed directly to the mountain and cast them at will. The true spirits may fail to acknowledge receipt, the merit may not reach its destination, and the loss would be grave—utmost care and deliberation are essential.\n\nThe reason for petitioning these mountain and water tablets within the altar is that the fast’s sponsor or disciples, constrained by public or private affairs, may be unable to personally visit the grotto’s gate. Thus, they are proclaimed together within the altar. If the sponsor or disciples do not shrink from the distance of mountains and waters or the toil of ascent, and personally accompany the assembled officials to the grotto’s precincts, then on the night of merit’s proclamation, after the memorial is presented, only the earthen tablet is petitioned. The mountain and water tablets are set aside, to be addressed in their proper rites at the mountain and water sites—this is most fitting. Careful deliberation must guide action; one must not cling rigidly to the text.\n\nWhen casting the three tablets, it is most excellent to burn one or two hundred paper coins for the local earth deity.\n\n**Method for Casting the Five Thearchs’ Tablets on the Three Primes and Eight Nodal Days to Seek Pardon for Transgressions and Petition the True Ones**\n*From the* True Writ Jade Formulae\n\n**Supreme Petition Tablet for the Lingbao Tradition to Remove Transgressions and Seek Immortality at the Five Marchmounts and Sacred Mountains**\n\nLingbao so-and-so, Master of the Imperial Thearchs, your servant [Name], aged [X] years, born in the month of [X], fate governed by the Thearch of [X], name registered at [X] Marchmount. Aspiring to transcendence, aspiring to immortality, to attain long life and cross the world’s bounds, to soar and ascend to the Upper Clarity. O True Ones of the Five Marchmounts, most divine, most numinous: beseech that my transgressions be erased from the records, my name inscribed in the Nine Heavens. Petition to approach the sacred mountain, transmitted via the Golden Dragon Courier.\n\n[Reign title, era name, year, month, first day, day, hour] at this [location] the proclamation is made.\n\nThese three tablet texts each include the year, name, and governing Thearch. The aspiration for transcendence and immortality, and the following text, are as stated in the Water Mansion’s earthen tablet and the Yellow Register’s water tablet. The sealing incantation of the Dragon-Wall Clasp is as in the previous fast’s method.\n\nFor the first casting of the three tablets, each uses nine clasps. For the second and third castings, only the dragon tablet is used, without clasps.\n\nAfter casting is complete, scatter incense, pour forth water, and chant the hymn:\n\nThe Primal Beginning’s covenant shines,\nImmortals’ names are inscribed.\nThe Three Offices, Nine Bureaus—\nNo transgression remains unremoved.\nScatter incense to the Five Thearchs,\nProclaim the covenant to the Great Void.\nAs petitioned, may I dwell\nThrough ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThree bows.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Most High, Boundless Dao.\nWith utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures.\nWith utmost sincerity, prostrate and bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.\n\nThe furnace is restored.\nO Fragrant Officer Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Attendant Fragrant Spirits: may the place where your servant casts the tablet spontaneously generate golden liquor, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred spirits and host of true ones gather here, before the grotto’s furnace. May your servant, in learning the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking immortality, attain immortality. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the fragrant smoke, swiftly conveying the words just proclaimed to the Most High, Boundless Dao, before the Sun Valley Divine King and the Nine Rivers’ Water Mansion and Water Thearch.\n\nEach: three bows.\n\nThe *Primary School of Immortals’ Hymns* is sung as usual.\n\nThe Dao speaks: You who with sincere heart set forth upon the supreme Dao, desiring to deliver all celestial beings, all good men and women, from the Three Evils, the Five Paths, and the Eight Difficulties—may they transcend the Three Evils, and in every life encounter the Dao. On the days of the Eight Nodes and the first of the month, cast the Three Primes’ jade tablets. Erase the records of past transgressions, inscribe names in Heaven. After three offerings, the Three Offices, Nine Bureaus, and all celestial realms will relay the petition to Heaven.\n\nTo the right, distinguish the myriad spirits, reverently guard the Five Thearchs. Attend and protect the Three Realms, oversee the gates and portals. Purify Heaven and Earth; gods, earth deities, sun, and moon come to pay homage. A thousand demons, ten thousand spirits dare not rashly intrude. With steadfast resolve, all endeavors are fulfilled. Seven generations of ancestors are liberated; from the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, they ascend to Heaven’s halls. Karmic retribution for good and evil in life and death is repaid in kind. The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus record merits and transgressions—this principle is most clear. Through countless lives, not a hair’s breadth is lacking.\n\nIf there are those of utmost dedication—emperors, kings, rulers of lands, officials, all people, nine generations of ancestors, those trapped in the Three Paths of darkness—who undertake the great Yellow Register fast for three days and nights, proclaim the covenant to the Nine Heavens, and cast the Three Primes’ tablets, the blessings and benefits are boundless, beyond words. You who earnestly uphold this, do not grow lax or idle, lest demons mar your body.\n\nMaster Daoist Zhang Chengguang says: Upon ascending the altar and receiving the Lingbao Central Covenant, in accordance with the *Spontaneous Golden Regulations*, cast ten golden clasps, release the dragon into the clear spring—this is the way to seek immortality. Ascend the altar again to receive the Five Elders’ Red Writ, the Two Registers, staff, and scepter, and stabilize resolve through contemplation of the subtle. Following the *Luminous True Regulations*, cast the Three Dragons’ twenty-seven clasps, with the mountain, water, and dwelling as pledges for the study of immortality. Then, with the jade formula, separately cast nine dragons’ twenty-seven clasps, and on the Eight Nodal Days cast the mountain, water, and dwelling tablets, forever erasing the records of transgressions and inscribing names in Heaven. Upon concluding the Yellow Register fast, cast the dragon tablet as well, following only the Three Primes’ tablet text, without additional proclamations or established oral formulae. The ignorant masses, passing this down, practice in confusion. In the past, I encountered my master, Lord Lu, who communed with spirits and entered the wondrous, whose words accorded with principle—none failed to evoke response.",

      "translated_text": "The sublime resides in the heart, yet its writings lack ritual forms. If one merely copies and submits them according to the scriptural text, the mountain, water, and dwelling spirits will not be duly recorded—all actions, seen and unseen, will be reckless, greatly deviating from the Mysterious Tradition. Thus, I have composed these *Three-Part Petition Texts*, each addressed to its respective immortal bureau. Additionally, I have separately set forth *Three Tablet Ready-Made Formulae*. Now, if one follows these clearly in practice, one will surely receive the carving of one’s name in the registers and the erasure of transgressions, with one’s name recorded in the Nine Mysteries. This will elevate one’s family to prior glory, cause one’s studies to flourish, and secure immortality in life and death. I reveal this to my disciples, to be revered and kept secret.\n\nGuangting states: The Great Dao, through the One *qi*, generates and transforms the Three Powers, shaping the myriad existences. Thus, the Three Primes’ courts were established to govern transgressions and blessings—namely, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, who truly preside over the Three Primes. Human life and death, longevity and early demise, transgressions and goodness, fortune and misfortune—none are not bound to them. The *Three Register Tablet Texts* are likewise the canonical forms of the Three Primes. In the method of the fast, one should submit the three tablets to report to the Three Primes. Thus, the mountain tablet is submitted to the Heavenly Cavern of Prostration, petitioning the Celestial Official of the Upper Prime; the water tablet is submitted to the Numinous Spring Water Palace, reporting to the Water Official of the Lower Prime; and the earth tablet is submitted at the altar or dwelling, reporting to the Earth Official of the Middle Prime. Within the tablet texts, the titles and ranks of the true spirits are clearly set forth.\n\nIn recent times, only the mountain and water tablets have been submitted. However, in the regions beyond the Huai and Zhe rivers, the ritual of the three tablets has long been practiced. Now, upon examining the origins, I have found the texts recorded by Master Zhang Chengguang, which petition the Three Primes with great precision, leaving no doubt in the submission and offering of pledges. Thus, they may be followed as a permanent model. Not only in receiving the scriptures but also in submitting the three tablets and conducting the fast for deliverance, all depend on the Three Primes. If all three tablets are duly submitted, the tallying of meritorious deeds will reach the courts of the Three Officials.

      "translated_text": "Revised by Master Du Guangting of the Tang, *Ritual of the Lantern*\n\nThe method of the ritual lantern originates from the *Golden Register* scriptures. In all fasts and Dao-trails, burning incense and kindling lanterns are the most urgent tasks. Incense conveys the heart’s sincerity and ascends to move the perfected spirits. Lanterns dispel darkness and illuminate the hidden, opening the underworld’s eternal night. Thus, the scriptures decree: burning incense and kindling lanterns illumine the blessed halls of all heavens above and the long-night hells below. Suffering souls and stagnant spirits, riding this radiance, may at last attain liberation.\n\nSince lanterns must each follow their proper method, they are arrayed according to the fundamental numbers of the Five Phases: nine in spring, three in summer, seven in autumn, five in winter, and twelve in the four seasons. The positions of lanterns for all heavens, all earths, the Eight Trigrams, and the Nine Underworlds are arranged according to their directions in the complete register texts.\n\nWhen incense is burned and invocations are chanted, blessings swiftly descend and misfortunes naturally dissolve. Whether on the night of the fast’s commencement or during its three- or seven-day course, lanterns are kindled according to the method. At dusk, when the Dao-trail concludes, the altar is exited. At the earth-gate, with hymns and banners, in measured and elegant steps, the master leads the assembled officials and disciples in circumambulation beneath the lanterns, chanting invocations at each position. After each invocation, the officials and disciples bow. Upon completion, with a resonant, empty tone, they are guided back before the Mystic Master. The dispersal follows the usual ritual.\n\n*Hymn of the Illumined Lantern*\nThe Most High scatters light in the ten directions,\nFloral lanterns convey pure sincerity.\nAll heavens glow resplendent,\nAll earths shine with clarity.\nMy body, too, becomes luminous,\nThe five viscera blossoming in splendor.\nThe blazing radiance illumines the Great Void,\nFar-reaching thoughts reach the Jade Capital.\n\nThis hymn is chanted in a drawn-out voice in the eastern regions of Songshan, the Yellow River, and Tonghua. At dusk, ascending the altar, the master of invocations is led beneath the lanterns. When the lantern ritual begins, this hymn is chanted first, and the assembly circumambulates the lanterns once, then arranges ranks at the earth-gate to chant invocations, thus fulfilling the ritual.\n\nThe officials arrange their ranks at the earth-gate. The master speaks:\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate and Great Void declare: Yin and yang conjoin in form, heaven and earth divide in shape. Day and night differ, light and darkness diverge. Thus, the pure and ethereal manifest as the abodes of immortals and sages in all heavens, while the turbid and dense flow into the realms of ghosts and spirits in all earths. Above the Nine Heavens, yin qi is wholly dispelled; below the Nine Earths, yang radiance is forever barred. In these shadowed realms, no light remains. At midday, they are veiled in thick mist; at dusk, they sink deeper into gloom. The souls of the long night have no means to awaken. Some beings, devoid of good karma and burdened by past sins, have since their deaths sunk into hell, enduring myriad torments, imprisoned in Fengdu. Deprived of the Three Luminaries, they suffer for kalpas uncounted.\n\nOur Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, opens many gates of salvation. He bequeaths the scripture of kindling lanterns to continue the light and illumine the night. Where the numinous radiance reaches, sins and afflictions are all dispelled. Through the merit of repentance and deliverance, they may fulfill the vow of rebirth.\n\nIf there are good men and good women who arouse the mind for the supreme Dao, follow the regulations, and come to the fast, preparing incense and oil, they may kindle lanterns on behalf of the sovereign, the emperor, the ruler and ministers, fathers and sons, the Three Wretched Paths, and the Nine Nights—whether in darkness or light—illuminating within and without according to the method. Above, they reflect upon the heavens and the halls of blessings; below, they shine upon the Nine Earths and the depths of hell.",

Where its flowing brilliance reaches, the suffering of forsaken souls is stilled. Where its divine splendor shines, the anguish of the dark and forlorn ceases. The merit of kindling lanterns brings boundless blessings—whether to deliver the departed or to dispel calamity and remove misfortune.\n\nOne should prepare fragrant oil and journey to the sacred temples. With sincere devotion, bow in reverence, and with utmost piety, gaze upon the true numina. Burn incense, kindle lanterns, and offer rites with vows and worship. Through earnest sincerity and heartfelt devotion, the power of blessings extends. The departed ascend to heaven, and the living receive grace.

Alternatively, infuse various incenses into the oil, so that the lamp’s flame burns with purity, diffusing its fragrance. Above, it moves the heavens; below, it purges foul impurities. The lantern’s light shines brightly, dispelling darkness and continuing illumination—thus accruing great merit.\n\nThe *Nine Dark Realms Lanterns* should be arranged before the sacred altar in the grand hall of the multitude of sages, divided into nine trees. Align them according to the nine directions, with nine lamps on each tree. Alternatively, each tree may have nine tiers, with nine lamps per tier. The number nine times nine accords with the pattern of heaven and earth. Below, it opens the nine nights; above, it reaches the nine mysteries. Delivering the living and rescuing the dead is the most sacred of blessings. For those of limited means, even nine lamps suffice—full preparation is not required. In this rite, one need only burn incense and invoke the true, offering sincere prayers in silent devotion. The merit thus communicated is of the same essence.\n\nAlternatively, one may prepare nine portions—or eighty-one—of water, congee, and seasonal fruits, arranging them before the nine directions, which is especially refined.

These offenses have offended the True Numinous Ones, accumulated transgressions congealing in the Lower Origin’s palaces, the numinous springs and boundless seas, the various river sources, the Eight Marshes and Nine Jiang, and the records of the Water Officials. Congealed into calamities, they have entwined through generations. Through this repentance, we humbly beseech the thorough purgation of all offenses. May the imperial enterprise flourish, the sagely legacy extend forever. May the ten thousand regions be at peace, the eight seas undisturbed by waves. May Disciple So-and-so’s transgressions be absolved, disasters eradicated. May the living and the deceased receive protection, the household and state be graced with favor. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the realm of Non-Action, in harmony with the Dao, merging with the True.\n\nThe assembled ministers, on behalf of Official So-and-so and Disciple So-and-so, perform the fast and practice the Dao, sincerely revering and submitting to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Revered Scriptures, the sacred talismans and precious writs, the secret treasuries of the heavens, the true teachings of the ten directions, and all the numinous guardians of the scriptures. Today, we burn incense, reverently submit, and repent, for Disciple So-and-so’s offenses committed from past lives to the present, extending through kalpas. These offenses have violated the categories of the Three Origins, the true precepts and mysterious statutes. Disrespecting the revered scriptures, slandering the orthodox canons, every thought and intention has fallen into the net of transgressions. Entwined and congealed, they have never been repented. Names inscribed on the black tablets, bodies beset by calamities and peril—without relying on the mysterious power, there would be no means of absolution. Through this prayer and repentance, we humbly beseech the thorough purgation of all offenses. May the sagely reign flourish, the imperial virtue extend afar. May the ten thousand regions be bright and tranquil, the four seas at peace. May Disciple So-and-so’s calamities be cleared, the living and the deceased dwell in safety. May all sentient beings bathe in the mysterious grace. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the realm of Non-Action, in harmony with the Dao, merging with the True.\n\n*Thus concludes the fifty-eighth fascicle of The Yellow Register Fasts of the Most High.*",
