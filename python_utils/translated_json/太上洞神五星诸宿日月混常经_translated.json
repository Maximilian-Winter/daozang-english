  "full_translation": "*The Supreme Cavernous Divine Scripture of the Five Planets, All Constellations, Sun, and Moon in Harmonious Constancy*\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Cavernous Divine Scripture of the Five Planets, All Constellations, Sun, and Moon in Harmonious Constancy*. The compiler is unknown, likely dating to the Song or Yuan dynasties. It speaks of the essences of the sun, moon, and stellar lodgings manifesting in bodily form to aid humanity. One scroll.\n\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Cavernous Divine Section, *Scriptural Texts* category.\n\n---\n\nThe stars of the Northern Dipper are the essence of the Great One. On the first day of each of the four *meng* months, they descend to divine for humanity, wandering among settlements. Their discernment and discourse differ from ordinary people. Those who sincerely seek and inquire shall never go unanswered.\n\n**Wood** is the essence of Jupiter, its nature benevolent. On *jia* or *yi* days after the Beginning of Spring, it wanders among temples and monasteries, appearing as a dignified figure of medium build with sparse whiskers, clad in green robes. It engages monks in debate on profound principles, its reasoning unmatched. Reverent and refined, its demeanor stands apart from the crowd—its eyes bright and clear, its teeth and speech fine, its responses gracious. Those who recognize it and inquire with propriety may present their heart’s desires, and all shall be granted. If one seeks wealth, it responds with benevolence, often secluding itself on *chen* days at the Eastern Marchmount.\n\n**Fire** is the essence of Mars, its nature ritual propriety. After the Beginning of Summer, on *bing* or *ding* days, it appears as a vermilion-clad youth, fair of complexion and dignified in form, robed in brocade of rare hues and damask of exotic patterns. Keen of ear and sharp of eye, it is rich in decorum—its bows, advances, and retreats all in accord with etiquette, its speech articulate. It delights in mingling with young boys, singing and chanting in the villages, foreseeing events with uncanny clarity. Those who recognize and inquire of it shall have their heart’s desires met, for it responds with ritual propriety. All who encounter it attain their aspirations, often secluding itself on *wei* days at the Southern Marchmount.\n\n**Earth** is the essence of Saturn, its nature trustworthiness. On *wu* or *ji* days during the four seasons and the reign of earth in late summer, it wanders among markets and taverns, clad in yellow robes, its appearance extraordinary. Fond of fine food and drink, it carries provisions to share with others. Those who encounter it receive food, drink, money, and goods—whatever they seek, it grants. It roams with wondrous principles, ever desiring to aid others. Those who meet it shall see their descendants prosper, their wealth and resources growing daily. It often secludes itself on *chen* days at Mount Song.\n\n**Metal** is the essence of Venus, its nature righteousness. On *geng* or *xin* days after the Beginning of Autumn, it wanders among the dwellings of women, clad in white robes, tall in stature. Skilled in music and eloquent of speech, it bestows treasures upon people. Those who recognize and seek it shall have their wishes fulfilled. At times, it appears as an elder riding a white horse, or bearing musical instruments, ever willing to grant the requests of others. It often secludes itself on *xu* days at Mount Hua.\n\n**Water** is the essence of Mercury, its nature wisdom. On *ren* or *gui* days, it wanders among secluded streams and ravines or upon terraces and pavilions, clad in dark robes, holding a ruler and reciting poetry in leisurely delight. Its speech is witty, rich in principle. Those who recognize and seek it shall receive teachings on literature, divination, and numerology. It often secludes itself on *wu* or *ji* days at Mount Heng.\n\n**The Sun** is the essence of the Great Yang. On *ding* or *si* days of the four *meng* months, it wanders in great marshes, clad in yellow-red robes, riding a dappled horse. It travels alone, singing and chanting for its own amusement, a satchel of texts slung upon its horse. Those who recognize it and seek it in the marshes on these days shall be taught the arts of ritual propriety, righteousness, and the scriptures of immortality. It frequents the households of noble women in great commanderies. Those who encounter it shall surely attain the arts of transcendence.\n\n**The Moon** is the essence of the Great Yin. On *xin* or *you* days, it appears as a woman, fair and eloquent, her bearing graceful as she wanders alone in secluded places. Those who recognize it often inquire of military strategies and extraordinary victories, for it broadly aids humanity. Those who encounter it shall be favored by kings and naturally attain fine official positions, enjoying lifelong nobility and wealth. It also delights in bestowing treasures upon others. Often, it secludes itself on *bingzi* days among military encampments, its compassion vast and loving. Those who seek it shall have their wishes fulfilled, obtaining money and clothing from elsewhere, and within three years, they shall attain wealth and nobility as they desire.\n\nThose who perceive the seven essences above and receive them with ritual propriety shall enjoy lifelong wealth and nobility, their official positions as they desire, all their requests fulfilled. What they obtain shall be the arts of transcending the world and attaining deathlessness.\n\nThe essence of **Horn Star** often appears on *yin* or *mao* days after the Beginning of Spring, wandering among temples and monasteries. Sparse of whisker and beard, it engages in debate on Chan principles, its reasoning unmatched. At times, it frequents taverns, drinking and reveling alone, clad in dark green robes. Those who recognize and seek it shall be taught the arts of nurturing life and sowing seeds.\n\nThe essences of **Kang, Di, and Chamber Stars** often travel together on *yin* or *mao* days, clad in dark green robes, all riding dappled horses. They wander among crowds or at grand vegetarian feasts, their appearances extraordinary, a faint purple aura above their heads. Those who recognize and seek them shall be granted arts to save the world, sparing them from poverty and suffering.\n\nThe essences of **Heart, Tail, and Winnowing Basket Stars** often appear together on *chen* days, clad in yellow robes, sometimes as Daoists wandering among temples and monasteries. Each holds a rare object in hand, their forms dignified, their speech sparse. Those who recognize and seek them shall be taught medical arts and remedies.\n\nThose who encounter and recognize the essences of these seven stars shall attain their desires, naturally gaining wealth and nobility, their spirits sharp, their wisdom keen and agile.\n\nThe essences of **Well and Ghost Stars** often appear on *si* days as master monks, dignified in bearing, holding prayer beads and *ruyi* scepters. They wander among the households of the loyal, filial, virtuous, and noble, seeking fine food and drink. If offered, they accept; if not, those who encounter them shall still attain wealth and nobility. On these days, when yin and yang unite, noble sons are surely born.\n\nThose who seek shall attain all without obstruction, and they delight in wondrous skills displayed outwardly, so that others make no further demands of them.\n\nThe essences of **Willow and Star** often appear on *jia-wu* days as Daoist priests, radiant in spirit, eloquent in speech. They entice others with the arts of the Dao and the methods of immortality, and those who seek them shall ascend in broad daylight. Their forms are clad in yellow-white robes, beneath which lie garments adorned with pearls. Those who recognize them and receive them with reverence shall prosper; if one harbors disrespect, they shall encounter bandits and ruin.\n\nThe essences of **Extended Net, Wings, and Chariot** appear together as old men, dressed in yellow, riding yellow oxen and bearing wine vessels. They wander among great estates and villages. Those who seek them are often gifted wine; those who drink it shall become earthbound immortals and never die. If one speaks ill or slanders them, they shall bear deformed children and suffer the ruin of their households within three years. If one reveres them, they shall bear noble sons, and wealth shall grow of its own accord.\n\nWhenever one encounters the divine essences of these seven stars, they shall become either a high minister or a master of the arts in their time. Within a month, they shall grow plump and fair, wealth shall come unbidden, and the wise and sagacious shall arrive without seeking. All shall meet with good fortune.\n\nThe essences of **Straddling Legs, Bond, and Stomach** appear as handsome youths, their patterns exquisite and their skills refined. Their silken robes shift in hue as they ride fine white horses, galloping freely. They often wander among villages on *shen-you* days, carrying rare treasures with them. Those who recognize and seek them shall receive all they desire, and if given fine fruits to eat, they shall never die. If a woman eats them, she shall bear a noble son, a high minister of extraordinary talent.\n\nThe essences of **Mao and Net** often appear on *geng-zi* days as youths skilled in music, sometimes bearing instruments as they wander at the gates of nobles and high ministers. They bring forth sons of talent and nobility; if daughters are born, they shall become consorts or empresses. They delight in wine, and those who offer it shall grow vastly wealthy.\n\nThe essences of **Turtle Beak and Three Stars** often appear on *wu-xu* days as children, graceful in appearance and full of charm. They ride donkeys, wear yellow robes, and hold vessels of gold and silver shaped like flowers and leaves, unlike those of ordinary folk. Those who encounter and seek them shall attain all their desires: naturally gaining fine official posts, beautiful wives and concubines, and splendid garments. Others shall bestow gifts upon them unbidden, for it is no feat of their own effort.\n\nWherever the essences of these seven stars arrive, the household shall know no poverty for generations. Those who recognize them shall not die, and all their desires shall be fulfilled. If one fails to receive them with reverence, within three years the household shall be ruined, its members perish, and they shall bear blind or deformed children, or raise wicked offspring.\n\nThe essences of **Dipper and Ox** often appear on *ren-zi* days as old women, fair of complexion, clad in dark green-black robes. They are eloquent and witty, carrying fine garments to sell. They favor the homes of the virtuous and the charitable, and those who receive their offerings shall honor them. If one wears their garments to court, the Son of Heaven shall favor them, and official posts shall come unbidden. If a woman wears them, she shall bear noble sons, wise and skilled in many arts, and gold and silver from the earth shall come to her without seeking.\n\nThe essence of **Woman Star** often appears on *gui-si* days as a maiden of twenty or younger, incomparable in beauty, clad in bright robes, graceful in movement, skilled in adornment, and adept at transforming others. She wanders among villages, enchanting men. Those who encounter her shall attain wealth and nobility, becoming high ministers of the state. Within three years, the ruler shall summon them of his own accord. If one treats her with irreverence or speaks improperly, within three years they shall suffer grave illness. If one seeks her arts, they shall obtain the immortal arts of the Mysterious Woman of Grand Yin and ascend in broad daylight.\n\nThe essences of **Emptiness, Rooftop, House, and Wall** often appear on *gui-chou* days as Buddhist nuns, fair of complexion and clad in fresh, clean robes. They wander among villages, sometimes arriving at the gates of households, where they expound parables to guide men. Those who encounter them shall see their fields, silkworms, livestock, and estates flourish that very year.\n\nDaily encounters shall bring ever-increasing prosperity, bearing noble sons who are destined to become high ministers. Great wealth and nobility shall come unbidden, and their beards and hair shall never whiten. Should one harbor desires yet find them unfulfilled, within a year their household shall be ruined, their kin perish, and they shall bear sightless children. Of the first seven stars, those who encounter them shall earn universal reverence—whatever they desire shall come to pass without seeking, and the aged shall regain their youth.\n\nThe essences of these celestial lodgings are recognized by many. Wherever these stellar essences descend upon a region, even in lands governed by sagely and enlightened officials, they shall manifest likewise. The Grand Duke recognized the essence of Venus; Li Si, the essence of Saturn; Zhuge Liang, the essence of Mars, thereby obtaining the secret military strategies of the *Bingji*; the Yellow Emperor recognized the essence of the Grand Yin’s moon and ascended in broad daylight. Zhang Liang recognized the essences of Jupiter and Venus; Han Xin, the essences of Horn and Neck; Li Jing, the essence of the Southern Seven Stars, thereby obtaining the *Wansheng Bingjue* and the *Leigong’s Formula*. Cao Cao recognized the essence of the sun; Li Chunfeng, the essence of the Eastern Seven Stars, mastering the celestial patterns and qi cycles. To enumerate them all would be endless—from ancient times to the present, many have attained such knowledge. The details are too numerous to record in full, yet those who encounter them shall naturally grow wise, attain wealth and nobility, and possess discernment beyond ordinary men. One must take heed.\n\nHere ends the *Supreme Cavernous Divine Scripture of the Five Planets, Celestial Lodgings, Sun, and Moon in Perpetual Harmony*.",

      "translated_text": "Daily encounters shall bring ever-increasing prosperity, bearing noble sons who are destined to become high ministers. Great wealth and nobility shall come unbidden, and their beards and hair shall never whiten. Should one harbor desires yet find them unfulfilled, within a year their household shall be ruined, their kin perish, and they shall bear sightless children. Of the first seven stars, those who encounter them shall earn universal reverence—whatever they desire shall come to pass without seeking, and the aged shall regain their youth.\n\nThe essences of these celestial lodgings are recognized by many. Wherever these stellar essences descend upon a region, even in lands governed by sagely and enlightened officials, they shall manifest likewise. The Grand Duke recognized the essence of Venus; Li Si, the essence of Saturn; Zhuge Liang, the essence of Mars, thereby obtaining the secret military strategies of the *Bingji*; the Yellow Emperor recognized the essence of the Grand Yin’s moon and ascended in broad daylight. Zhang Liang recognized the essences of Jupiter and Venus; Han Xin, the essences of Horn and Neck; Li Jing, the essence of the Southern Seven Stars, thereby obtaining the *Wansheng Bingjue* and the *Leigong’s Formula*. Cao Cao recognized the essence of the sun; Li Chunfeng, the essence of the Eastern Seven Stars, mastering the celestial patterns and qi cycles. To enumerate them all would be endless—from ancient times to the present, many have attained such knowledge. The details are too numerous to record in full, yet those who encounter them shall naturally grow wise, attain wealth and nobility, and possess discernment beyond ordinary men. One must take heed.\n\nHere ends the *Supreme Cavernous Divine Scripture of the Five Planets, Celestial Lodgings, Sun, and Moon in Perpetual Harmony*.",
