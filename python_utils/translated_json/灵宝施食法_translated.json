  "full_translation": "**The Lingbao Offering of Food Ritual**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Lingbao Offering of Food Ritual*\nAuthor unknown, approximately dating to the Song or Yuan dynasties. It expounds the rites and methods for offering food to the deceased. One fascicle.\n**Source Text:** *Supplement to the Daoist Canon*\n\nThis ritual may be practiced daily, which is most excellent. If one cannot maintain perpetual abstinence, it is still permissible so long as one avoids the five pungent vegetables, impure substances, and intoxication. If performed only on fast days, that too depends on the practitioner.\n\nEach morning at mealtime, first set aside a portion of pure rice in a small container. At night, when all is quiet, face the void and silently recite the *Mantra for Purifying the Three Karmas*, as in the *Morning Repentance Before the Perfected*. While reciting, one must unify body and mind, cast off worldly burdens, dissolve illusory realms, and perceive the radiant brilliance of golden light.\n\nNext, recite the *Mantra to the Earth God*, visualizing the Earth Deity standing in attendance. The Earth God of this place is most efficacious, ascending to heaven and descending to earth, traversing the hidden and the nether realms. As my intercessor, he must not delay, and on the day of merit, his name shall be inscribed in the *Upper Clarity*.\n\nThen recite the *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* once. The recitation of this scripture serves to cultivate sincerity and invoke responsive resonance. While reciting, one must be free of distracting thoughts, all conditions stilled, the light of the sun illuminating above, the *Niwan* radiant with perfect light, suffused with the compassion of the Most High, the host of Perfected arrayed within.\n\nNext, offer the invocation:\n*\"Your humble servant [Name], bowing in reverence and taking refuge, respectfully addresses the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and the Natural, the Jade Clarity Lord and Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure, the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue of the Most High Lord Lao, the Compassionate Father of Azure Radiance and Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering, the Heavenly Worthies of Salvation in All Directions, the Perfected and Divine Lads of Salvation in All Directions, the Three Perfected Lords of the Supreme Clarity and the Mysterious Unity, the Great Dharma Masters of the Three Heavens and the Orthodox Unity Perfected Observer, the Perfected Lord of the Left Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, the Perfected Lord of the Celestial Master and Grand Historian of the Nine Provinces, the Primordial Lady of the Golden Watchtower Who Preserves the Wondrous Dao, the Perfected Lord of the Unsurpassed Savior Bodhisattva, the Divine Administrators of the Nine Heavens Who Deliver Souls, all the Perfected Immortals who have attained the Dao in the Ten Directions, the Lineage Masters of the Registers of the Dao, the Marshals and Generals of Thunder and the Five Peaks, the Officers and Attendants of the Divine Tigers Who Pursue and Capture, and the Great Gods of the Three Primes and Five Paths.*\n\n*With profound reverence, I beseech your boundless compassion to cast your penetrating gaze upon this humble offering. Here, at [Location], the Daoist [Name] abstains from a meal to offer food, universally aiding the hidden spirits. May auspicious light descend to illuminate the nether paths, summoning and guiding the wandering souls to swiftly arrive. Relying upon the power of the Three Treasures and the wisdom of the Compassionate One, may sweet dew be scattered and dharma-food transformed, pervading the ten directions and all realms, so that ghosts and spirits may all receive deliverance.\"*\n\nNext, recite the *Mantra for Illuminating Ghosts and Spirits*:\n*\"Namo wei fu ding ji li.\"*\nOne breath, seven repetitions. *\"Swiftly come and be gathered!\"*\nVisualize a mass of black *qi*, vast and boundless, approaching from behind the left shoulder, within which myriad points of starlight shine. With one inhalation and exhalation, disperse it before you, as if divine generals lead their hosts.\n\nNext, offer the invocation:\n*\"I solemnly summon all demonic spirits, human spirits, hell-beings, hungry ghosts, and animals of the ten directions and boundless worlds; all male and female orphaned souls, those who perished in calamities, those who owe lives, wealth, kindness, or righteousness; prisoners of karmic debt; those who fell in battle or died unjustly from ancient times to the present, in distant lands or this realm; all wandering souls and stagnant spirits, ghosts and numinous beings—may you all, by the power of the Dao, come to this sacred altar to receive food and resolve enmities, ascending through merit and transformation.\"*\n\nNext, recite the *Mantra for Opening the Throat with Sweet Dew*:\n*\"Om li yuan xi ping zha xi she hua ye.\"*\nOne breath, nine repetitions.\nVisualize the Compassionate One responding and floating in the void, scattering sweet dew. Press the tongue against the upper palate, lips and teeth closed, gaze directed upward to the crown. When the mouth is filled with sweet moisture, gradually swallow the fluid, transforming heat and vexation into coolness, banishing hunger and thirst—thus are the hidden spirits all succored.\n\nNext, recite the *Mantra for Transforming Food*:\n*\"Om bu lu li yan yu duo she.\"*\nOne breath, seven repetitions.\nBy the power of the divine mantra, transform the dharma-food, making it vast and boundless. Then recite the *Five Kitchens Mantra* once, slowly and unhurriedly:\n*\"One breath harmonizes with the Great Harmony, attaining the One Dao, all in perfect accord. There is no thought of thought, nor seeking of non-thought; thought arises without attachment. This is the dharma as it is—hold to it thus. Do not let the mind cling to the mind, nor dwell in cessation. Cut off the mind’s attachments, yet do not preserve the mind. When true, guard the true origin; cultivate the will, detach from the will. Accumulated cultivation does not depart from the will, yet the will is not cultivated. Past karma is without self; know that all foods are *qi*-bound. *Qi* is not bound by long stillness; bound *qi* returns to the original *qi*. Take as you should, release as you must.\"*\n\nNext, recite the *Mantra for Resolving Enmities*:\n*\"Hua men om li hong, dissolving the debts of the five ghosts.\"*\nOne breath, seven repetitions.\nWith body and mind serene and clear, free from resentment or aversion, may the multitude of souls awaken, forgetting both kindness and grievance, naturally attaining liberation.\n\nFinally, proclaim the dispersal:\n*\"All divine beings, may your hunger be sated and your emptiness filled, your heat and vexation cooled. May all conflicts be resolved and enmities reconciled. Further, if you take refuge in the Dao, you shall avoid falling into hell. If you take refuge in the scriptures, you shall avoid falling into the realm of hungry ghosts. If you take refuge in the master, you shall avoid falling into the animal realm. If you uphold the Nine Wondrous Precepts of the Perfected, you shall eradicate the great sins of the Nine Dark Prisons. If you make the Four Great Vows, you shall attain the Dao’s fruition. Now, I proclaim each in turn—listen with your hearts.*\n\n*The Three Refuges are: taking refuge in the Wondrous Dao of the Great Jade Capital of the Great Net; taking refuge in the *Jade Scripture of the Inner Radiance of the Flowery Hall*; and taking refuge in the lineage masters who have attained the Dao in heaven and earth.*\n\n*The Nine Precepts of the Perfected are:*\n*1. Be respectful and yielding, filial and nurturing to parents.*\n*2. Be diligent and loyal to your sovereign.*\n*3. Do not kill; be compassionate and save all beings.*\n*4. Do not engage in licentiousness; maintain integrity in conduct.*\n*5. Do not steal; act with righteousness and self-sacrifice.\"*\n\n6. Do not rage; do not oppress others with fury.\n7. Do not deceive; do not flatter, rob, or harm the good.\n8. Do not be arrogant; do not scorn the utmost truth.\n9. Do not waver; uphold the precepts with single-minded devotion.\n\nThe Four Great Vows are:\nVow to illuminate your original nature and not fall into the deluded ford;\nVow to awaken great compassion and depart from all emotional desires;\nVow to broadly cultivate merit and virtue, universally saving all beings;\nVow to take refuge in the true lineage, praising and propagating the Dao’s transformation.\n\nBy upholding the above refuges and precepts, restraining body and mind, and sustaining the power of your vows, you shall remain unsullied through the kalpas. May all beings throughout the future eons, through this same cultivation, each attain liberation and transcendence.\n\nNext, the *Food-Dispersing Incantation*:\nI set forth pure and undefiled offerings,\nUniversally bestowed upon the hosts of hidden souls.\nOne grain pervades the ten directions,\nShared by river-sands of ghosts and spirits.\n\nNext, bow in reverence and gaze as they depart, then dedicate the merit.\nThe divine radiance ascends in audience,\nPiercing through the crown gate.\nClose the qi with fierce focus,\nExhale sharply through the left hand,\nAnd trace the *Wu* character.\nAmidst the surging black qi,\nTen thousand points of gentle light\nAscend into formlessness,\nUtterly unobstructed—\nBeware of doubt and stagnation.\n\nThe incantation:\nMay this merit be dedicated\nTo the Great Compassionate Honored One.\nMay it bless my lineage and kin,\nMasters, teachers, and all dependents.\nMay it extend to all beings,\nThat all may attain the supreme Dao.\n\nIn the preceding incantation, characters with the \"mouth\" radical or \"side\" component are to be pronounced on one side only. For standard characters with established pronunciations, recite them as usual, without hesitation or confusion.\n\nThe *Lingbao Rite of Offering Food* is now complete.",
