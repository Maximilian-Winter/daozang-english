Among the various stones, some are not commonly known, and not all elixirs require them. The fifteen *Nodding Vermilion* methods are later additions, sharing the same stone names and thus included here.\n\n**Chalcanthite Water**\nProcess one *jin* of chalcanthite by grinding it with thick vinegar until moistened, place it in a bamboo tube, and cover it with two *liang* of nitre. Seal the opening with lacquer, place the bamboo tube in a rice steamer filled with vinegar, and bury it three *chi* deep in the earth.

Refine it, then place it in a bamboo tube, adding two *liang* of nitre per *jin*, seal the opening with lacquer, and bury it three *chi* deep in the earth. After fifteen days, the water forms, called *Golden Flowing Liquid*.\n\n**Iron Bloom Water**\nTake iron bloom and process it with *Cloud Essence Salt Water*, moistening it until damp, place it in a bamboo tube, adding two *liang* of nitre per *jin*, seal the opening with lacquer, and immerse it in a jar of vinegar. Bury it three *chi* deep in the earth. After forty-five days, the water forms, called *Mysterious Numinous Golden Compassion Water*, which can confer immortality.\n\n**Lead Bloom Water**\nTake five *shao* of frost-like powder and mix it with *Golden Elder Bloom Powder*, moistening it with *Cloud Essence Salt Water* until damp, place it in a bamboo tube, adding two *liang* of nitre per *jin*, seal the opening with lacquer, and immerse it in a jar of vinegar. Bury it three *chi* deep in the earth, and warm it with horse-dung fire. After thirty days, the water forms.\n\n**Bloom Water**\nProcess accumulated snow by moistening it with *Yellow Light Mercury* until damp. For each *jin* of bloom powder, use three *liang* of mercury, place it in a bamboo tube, seal the opening with lacquer, and immerse it in a jar of vinegar. Bury it three *chi* deep in the earth, and warm it with horse-dung fire. After thirty days, the water forms, called *Flowing Serenity*.\n\nIn secluded places, if these methods are followed, they will never fail.\nGao Qi says: First, pour five *dan* of wine into flowing water at the chosen site. If there is no flowing water, dig a well. Pour the wine into the well to stabilize the earth’s *qi*, so that all practitioners may drink and eat of this water. The fire used should be a *winning fire*. For *sudden fire*, let the chaff fire reach within one *cun* of the vessel.\n\nThe transmission of divine scriptures requires a solemn vow, using one *liang* of gold fish, a jade dragon, and a silver ring as tokens, replacing the ancient oath of cutting hair and smearing blood. Since such items are no longer available in this age and cannot be omitted without violating ritual propriety, reverently prepare forty *chi* of blue cloth as a substitute for the gold fish pledge, and forty *chi* of silk as a token for the silver ring and jade dragon. Present these to a master who possesses the scriptures. The master shall distribute them to wandering scholars in the mountains, not keeping them for personal use. This clarifies the celestial covenant, ensuring no selfishness. Violating the oath will invoke punishment from the four directions.\n\n**Inauspicious Days for Elixir-Making**\nSpring: *Wu-chen*\nSummer: *Ding-si*, *Wu-shen*, *Ji-si*, *Chou-wei*, *Chen*\nAutumn: *Wu-xu*, *Ji-hai*, *Xin-hai*, *Geng-zi*\nWinter: *Wu-yin*, *Ji-mao*, *Gui-you*, *Wei-xu*\nAlso avoid days of *Ren-bing*, *Wu-ding*, *Hai-earth*, *Wu-gui*, *Xin-si*, the day’s *Jian*, *Ri-sha*, *Fan-zhi*, *Yuan-ji*, the first, middle, and last months of the season, *Shou-bi*, the last day of the month, the first day of the month, the *Shang-shuo*, *Ba-kui*, *Wang-wang*, *Liu-hou*—all are inauspicious. Elixirs made on these days will not succeed.\n\nFor making *Six-One Mud*, one must also choose an auspicious day.\nHere ends the *Thirty-Six Water Methods*.",
