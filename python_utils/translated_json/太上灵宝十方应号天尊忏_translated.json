  "full_translation": "The *Repentance Ritual of the Most High Numinous Treasure Ten Directions Responsive Titles Celestial Worthy*\n\n**Title:** *Repentance Ritual of the Most High Numinous Treasure Ten Directions Responsive Titles Celestial Worthy* (Ten fascicles; originally comprising Fascicle One and Fascicles Three through Nine).\n\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan* Section, *Weiyi* Category.\n\n---\n\n**Fascicle Two of the Repentance Ritual of the Most High Numinous Treasure Ten Directions Responsive Titles Celestial Worthy**\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, having heard the Most High expound the karmic causes of good and evil, and the matters of retribution being settled, bowed in reverence and praise. With utmost sincerity and earnestness, he addressed the Most High again, saying:\n\n\"Sentient beings, deluded and ignorant, are enmeshed in the snares of the world and cannot awaken. They remain trapped in the cycle of sin, drifting through birth and death, ever abiding in suffering. Gazing up to the Merciful Worthy, they yearn for enlightenment, that in future lives as men and women, they may turn their hearts to the good Dao and not fall into the Three Wretched Realms.\"\n\nThe Most High replied:\n\n\"All sentient beings, casting off one body to receive another, have for kalpas beyond measure allowed their bodies, minds, thoughts, and intentions—along with their eyes, ears, noses, and mouths—to accumulate manifold sins. Deluded and ensnared by sensory contact, they commit transgressions both inwardly and outwardly. The six senses arise in turn, each begetting the next. The roots of sin grow ever deeper, and with every thought, they commit boundless wrongs—sins as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges. These ingrained habits, long accumulated, reside within the body. From past causes to present ones, from kalpa to kalpa, they cannot be reckoned. Yet with a single thought of turning the heart, all may be purified.\n\nIt is like a bright mirror, its surface obscured by dust and grime, all manner of impurities gathered to cloud its clarity, leaving it dimmed within and without. But should it one day encounter a skilled craftsman who wipes, polishes, and washes it, its inner and outer surfaces will gleam with radiance, illuminating all near and far, restored to its original brightness. Why is this so? Because its nature was originally pure.\n\nSentient beings are likewise: their spirits are fundamentally pure, free from all defilement. Yet after receiving form, they gradually become stained by the dust of inner and outer impurities, accumulating transgressions. The six roots, six desires, six emotions, six entrances, six defilements, six thieves, six dusts, and six consciousnesses discriminate between right and wrong, recklessly committing foul and corrupt acts. Darkness spreads within and without, and their true nature is lost. Adrift in the cycle of death and rebirth, they perpetually generate the causes of sin. When retribution and karmic conditions converge, they enter hell, suffering myriad torments, sinking for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nOut of compassion, I take pity on sentient beings. Thus, from kalpa to kalpa, I manifest in the world—now as a sage, now as an ordinary being—assuming various responsive forms to teach and transform them. I propagate scriptures and precepts, awakening and delivering them, that they may escape suffering. Yet sentient beings, lacking good fortune, fail to awaken. Even the sages, immortals, and perfected beings of the heavens constantly desire that people cleanse evil and cultivate good, for then benevolent spirits will protect and guard them. If sins remain bound to the body and one does not repent, malevolent spirits will bring calamity, and they will suffer in birth and death.\n\nAll sentient beings know only to adorn their faces, clothing, hands, and feet outwardly, yet do not know to cleanse their bodies and minds inwardly to dissolve the bonds of sin. If, like the face, hands, feet, and clothing, they diligently purify themselves, then good will surely find its place, and what fault could reach them? Now, I shall distinguish these matters further, and each should repent accordingly.\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Repentance for Killing Living Beings**\n\nThe Most High addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, saying:\n\n\"All sentient beings, past and present, unmindful of compassion, kill and harm living beings, devouring them insatiably. Whether for parents, themselves, their children, grandchildren, or kinfolk, or for following omens of good and ill fortune, gathering in villages and hamlets, they kill living beings beyond count. Whether for offering sacrifices to ancestors, praying to the earth gods, or celebrating at the hearth, they kill living beings without measure.\n\nThey kill cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs, donkeys, horses, chickens, and other domesticated creatures; or deer, foxes, hares, tigers, leopards, jackals, and wolves, and other beasts of the mountains and wilds; or geese, ducks, crows, magpies, turtledoves, kites, owls, teals, egrets, and other flying birds; or insects, snakes, vipers, scorpions, wasps, centipedes, millipedes, crickets, ants, and the like; or soft-shelled turtles, terrapins, tortoises, alligators, fish, shrimp, sturgeon, crabs, snails, clams, frogs, and other aquatic creatures; or dung beetles, midges, moths, caterpillars, earthworms, and other small insects; or mosquitoes, fleas, lice, mayflies, and other ephemeral creatures.\n\nThey fly hawks and unleash hounds, exhausting forests and draining marshes to kill living beings; or set nets and spread snares, or set fires to mountains to kill living beings; or wield bows and arrows, knives and staves to kill living beings; or, whether sitting, lying, walking, or standing, crush living beings with their hands or trample them underfoot; or build houses and construct walls, killing living beings; or plow fields and sow crops, digging pits and excavating earth, killing living beings; or cut grass and level ground, gather firewood and fell trees, killing living beings; or pluck flowers and pick fruit, raise silkworms and dry cocoons, killing living beings; or light lamps and kindle fires, turning their backs to the light and facing the dark, killing living beings; or divert water into burrows or pour boiling water on the ground, killing living beings; or drink water, eat rice, wash their hair, or bathe their bodies, killing living beings; or rip open wombs and break eggs, severing sinews and shattering bones, killing living beings; or open their mouths, form intentions, stretch out their hands, or move their feet, killing living beings; or before the Celestial Worthies, the great Dao, the true scriptures, and wondrous dharma, or all the sages, kill living beings; or under the three luminaries of heaven and earth, kill living beings; or on the Three Primes, Eight Festivals, Ten Straightfast Days, or during fasts, or in wind, rain, darkness, and gloom, kill living beings; or within sacred altars, numinous temples, or upon the seats of dharma assemblies, kill living beings; or in anger, sorrow, joy, or revelry, kill living beings; or when compounding medicines to heal the sick, kill living beings; or when life ends in their hands or death comes by the blade; or in military campaigns; or for vengeance; or relying on power and might.\"\n\nOr relying on wealth and power; or severing heads and limbs, flaying skin and fur, searing with fierce fire, boiling in scalding water; or forcibly separating mother and child, cutting off gestation; or attacking the root of life, causing annihilation; or killing through terror, poison, or curses; or self-killing, instructing others to kill, intentional killing, accidental killing, killing by speech, killing by intention, killing by thought, killing by witnessing, killing by relaying orders. Such deeds, concealed within, remain unconfessed; without repentance, they bind one for kalpas unending. With reverent devotion, I sincerely bow in faith.\n\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Great Sage, Perfectly Real, Original Celestial Worthy.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of the Mysterious Capital’s Wondrous Manifestation.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth’s Opening Salvation.\nWith sublime faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of the Lofty and Venerable Canopy.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of the Self-Moving Wheel.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Ascends the Supreme Realm.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Turning Numinous Response.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Carefree Great Emptiness.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Vast and Mysterious Merit.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy Illumined by Sun and Moon.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of the Purple Palace’s Bestowed Grace.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Subdues Demonic Might.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Refined Rebirth.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Lofty Mystery.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Great Might.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Brahmanic Form.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Cypress Void Wisdom.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Transcendent and Exalted Salvation.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Teaches and Transforms Myriad Beings.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Eternal Joy and Guidance.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Jade Splendor and Numinous Radiance.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Mysterious Vault’s Bestowed Transformation.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Golden Countenance.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Receives and Treasures the Scriptures.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Disperses Flowing Might and Virtue.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Utmost Sagacity and Profound Grace.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Knows Past Lives.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Enters the Dharma Gate.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Serene Qi.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Penetrating Vision and Mystery.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Ninefold Numinous Self-Mastery.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of the Heavenly Gate’s Lofty Renown.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of the Dragon Chariot’s Descent and Salvation.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Compassion for the Five Sufferings.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Fragrant Light and Virtue.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Jeweled Form and Joy.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Pities the Afflicted.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Liberates from the Cage.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of the Dragon’s Voice and Merciful Salvation.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Celestial Worthy of Unobstructed Purity.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion and Salvation from Suffering.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion and the Supreme Ultimate.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion and Universal Salvation.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Perfected of Great Compassion and Wondrous Conduct.\n\nI take refuge in the Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions and all the Great Perfected Sages. From kalpas immeasurable, I, so-and-so, have cast off bodies and received bodies; I may have committed the sins of killing described above, or my ancestors, parents, children, descendants, and kin may have committed such sins of killing, extending to the present. Today, I rely upon the grace of great compassion to attain thorough repentance, resolve karmic entanglements, and increase good affinities. May all the slain—feathered flocks, furred herds, and creeping creatures—by virtue of this extraordinary merit, each be transformed, liberated, and attain carefree transcendence.\n\nI prostrate to the Three Treasures of the Ten Directions, the True and Perfect.\n\n**Chapter on the Repentance of the Three Karmas**\n\nThe Most High addressed the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, saying: All sentient beings, sunk in evil destinies without means of liberation, do so because of the three karmas of body, mind, and speech.\n\nFirst, the sins of bodily karma: failing to reflect upon one’s own body, which receives the nurturing of the Two Modes, the illumination of the Three Luminaries, the sustenance of the Four Seasons, and the generation of the Five Agents, yet remains unaware of gratitude, reverence, or awe. Failing to reflect upon one’s body, which receives the nurture of parents, the instruction of teachers, yet does not uphold filial devotion. Failing to reflect upon one’s body, which receives the protection and transformation of kings and great ministers, yet does not cultivate loyalty and respect. Failing to reflect upon one’s body, which is recorded in the registers of sin and merit by all the sages, yet does not believe in the retribution of good and evil, assuming all is naturally enduring, remaining unaware, unafraid, unrepentant, unguarded, and careless—only craving refinement, indulging in evil influences, committing boundless killings, thefts, and sexual misconduct, violating norms and disrupting order, drinking to excess and acting wantonly.\n\nSecond, the sins of mental karma: the fire of ignorance burns ceaselessly. The six senses and three delusions race without restraint; from this arise all evils. Or conceiving the thought of stealing from the lofty sages, the sacred scriptures, secret registers, numinous shrines, pure precincts, gardens, flowers, fruits, and offerings to the Dharma. Or conceiving the thought of stealing from the state treasuries, the wise and the noble, as well as the lowly and foolish, all manner of things. Any object, if coveted in a single thought, constitutes theft. False imaginings of good and evil arise within; retribution for good and evil manifests without. Or conceiving thoughts of defying the Three Luminaries, belittling the multitude of sages. Or conceiving schemes in secret, plotting to wrong the virtuous. Or conceiving the thought of killing living beings, willfully harming creatures. Or conceiving deceitful, cunning, and treacherous thoughts, engaging in villainy and slander. Or conceiving envy toward those superior to oneself, harboring jealousy and self-importance. Or conceiving the thought of teaching others to do evil, causing them to transgress righteousness. Or conceiving the thought of ruining others’ successes, obstructing their good deeds. Or conceiving the thought of separating others from their kin, severing their bonds of affection.\n\nOr conceiving the thought of violating scriptures and defying the Dharma, breaking fasts and transgressing precepts. Or beholding all forms and appearances, conceiving desires of every kind. Or toward all beings, sacred and profane, conceiving thoughts of ignorance and folly. Or conceiving the thought of turning from truth toward falsehood, believing in perverse and inverted views. Or conceiving the thought of obstinately clinging to one’s own ignorance and baseness, refusing to follow virtuous transformation. Or conceiving the thought of harming others to benefit oneself, injuring them to enrich oneself. Or conceiving thoughts of anger, hatred, stinginess, and greed, or of frivolity and mockery. Or conceiving the thought of remembering a single fault in another while forgetting their past kindness and righteousness. Or conceiving the thought of harming others with venomous words, or bringing calamity through fair speech. Or conceiving the thought of reckless fantasies and dreams, indulging in dissipation and impropriety. Or conceiving the thought of speaking one way while thinking another, praising to the face and slandering behind the back. Or conceiving the thought of seeking refuge in haste, then retreating without turning back.\n\nAll such thoughts, lacking the mind of equanimity, arise daily in the lives of beings.\n\nThird are the sins of verbal karma. All men and women accumulate verbal transgressions as deep as kalpas. Or consuming the five pungent flavors and meat, filling and nourishing the body without shame or satiety, indulging all day in harsh speech, divisive words, deceit, and false accusations. Or toward the Most Perfect Great Dao, the Three Luminaries of Heaven and Earth, the precious scriptures and wondrous Dharma, the worthy and the elders, teachers and parents, the high and the low, the poor and the rich, the spirits in darkness and in light—uttering flowery and ornate words, never truthful or sincere. All curses and imprecations, slanderous and abusive speech, scolding the wind and cursing the rain, berating superiors and inferiors, mocking the foolish and the wise, responding to good with evil, fostering enmity and strife, speaking perversely to humiliate others, using clever words to delude the multitude, judging good and evil, sowing discord among kin and friends, passing off falsehood as truth, turning emptiness into substance, dwelling on others’ faults, extolling one’s own virtues, amplifying others’ grievances to advance oneself, boasting and deceiving, suppressing the good and upright.\n\nThough reciting scriptures and teachings, inwardly harboring arrogance and falsehood, never truly taking refuge, yet claiming merit for oneself. When the Most Divine, all-hearing and upright, does not respond to flattery or supplication, one then generates slander and defamation. The sins of the three karmas arise in every moment, unceasing and unrecognized. Layer upon layer, they weigh down the boat; accumulating evil, one falls into ruin. Today, turning in sincerity, may all be repented.\n\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Great Sage, the Most Perfect Primordial Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Augments Good Affinities.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Crimson Palace of Flying Steps.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Body of Eternal Joy.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Mystery and Lofty Mystery.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Towers Ascending in Emptiness.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Faith and Wisdom.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Causes of Emergence from the World.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Terrace of Pure Radiance.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Virtue and Self-Mastery.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Ultimate Without Name.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Origin.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Treasure and Luminosity.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Good Fragrance.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Bears the Sun of Wisdom.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Upright and Tranquil True Appearance.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Fans the True Wind.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Good Contemplation and Mystery.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Bell.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Good Intentions and Aspirations.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Luminosity.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Majestic Virtue and Purity.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Compassion and Salvation.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Treasure Radiance Illuminating the Boundless.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Lion-like Dignity and Decorum.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy, King of Meritorious Penetration.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Illumination and Contemplation.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Heavenly Anxiety and Virtue.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Light Breaking Through Afflictions.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Stillness and Silence.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Augments Expedient Means.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy, Lord of Sandalwood Virtue.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Pure Treasure.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Treasure Eloquence.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Radiance Pervading the Darkest Reaches.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Opens and Communicates Holy Power.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Empty Sky’s Appearance.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Immortal Spirits’ Pristine Essence.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Five Clouds’ Soaring Traces.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Remembers the Deluded Multitude.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Extracts from Sin.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion Who Universally Saves.\nWith sincere faith, we bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Wondrous Conduct.\n\nWe take refuge in the Most High Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and all the Great Perfected Sages.\n\nFrom kalpas without measure until this day, I, so-and-so, have cast off bodies and received bodies, and the sins of the three karmas I have committed are boundless and immeasurable, concealed within this form. Or perhaps the sins committed by my ancestors, and those for which I, so-and-so, now suffer retribution—relying on the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthies, may they deign to deliver and uplift me, dissolving the roots of the three karmas and purifying the six senses. May I be spared the punishments of the Nine Dark Realms: the body flayed by wind-knives, the heart pierced by iron halberds, molten bronze poured into the mouth, the tongue torn out. May I be delivered and liberated.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves before the Three Treasures of the Ten Directions, the True and Perfect.\n\n**Chapter on Releasing Enmity**\n\nThe Most High addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, saying: Of all the sufferings of sinking into evil destinies and the bitter toils of birth and death, none is so difficult to escape, nor so deeply entangled in mutual retribution, as the sin of enmity. All beings in the world of abandoning the worthy and forsaking the good have yet to awaken to the good Dao. All day long, they diligently increase their karmic deeds, unaware that harboring enmity brings no benefit to themselves. They merely see matters before their eyes and give rise to ignorance. Or they inwardly nurse grievances, vainly disturbing the heart’s core.\n\nLittle do they know that the gods who govern fate and oversee all within heaven and earth and the void, along with the spirits within the human body who record transgressions, record their resentments and submit them to the Celestial Palace, where their offenses are determined. Delivered to the courts of the netherworld, once they enter evil destinies, they endure every kind of suffering. Reborn among humans, they again become enemies. Age after age, life after life, without end—all is self-created and self-endured, as inseparable as form and shadow. How could one escape?\n\nThus, the perfected ones, in great matters, relinquish rank and even life itself; in small matters, they forsake adornments and sever attachments, strictly upholding emptiness and stillness, refraining from contention between self and others—all precisely to eliminate this enmity. Moreover, among one’s closest kin, where filial devotion and deep affection should naturally abound, discord instead prevails in many cases. This is all due to the weight of enmity from past lives, which causes such conditions in this present existence.\n\nThose who serve as teachers, revered parents, elders, or superiors often impose expectations of service and repayment, and if these are not met, resentment arises. Those who are children, descendants, or family members often expect kindness, love, and nurturance, and if these fall short, resentment is born. Without expectations, how could resentment exist?\n\nResentment may arise toward heaven and earth, the Three Luminaries, and the exalted perfected sages; toward wind and rain, thunder and lightning, bitter cold and scorching heat; toward rulers, parents, teachers, and elders, or the six relations of kin; toward fields and gardens, homes and dwellings, the five grains and five flavors; toward hemp and silk, fine fabrics, fruits and vegetables; toward friends and associates, in struggles for fame and profit; in buying and selling, where prices are low on purchase and high on sale; in public and private disputes, with cunning words and twisted arguments.\n\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Numinous Primordial Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Treasure Radiance Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Fragrant Virtue Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Wisdom-Sun Heavenly Worthy of Universal Reception.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Upright and Tranquil True Form Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Fans the True Wind.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Contemplation.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Golden Pillar Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Good Intentions.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Great Illuminating Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Majestic Virtue and Pure Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Mysterious Compassion and Salvific Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Treasure Radiance Illuminating the Boundless Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Lion’s Majestic Demeanor.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Pervades Merit and Virtue.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Universally Illuminating Contemplative Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Heavenly Care and Virtue.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Light Dispelling Afflictions.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Stillness.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Augmenting Expedient Means.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy, Lord of Sandalwood Virtue.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Pure Treasure.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Treasure Eloquence.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Light Pervading the Darkest Reaches.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Opens the Sagely Power.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Void and Form.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Immortal Spirits and Pristine Simplicity.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Five Clouds Ascending the Path.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Remembers the Deluded Multitudes.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Salvation from Suffering.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Liberation from Sin.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Universal Salvation.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Wondrous Conduct.\n\nWe take refuge in the Most High Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and all the great perfected sages.\n\nFrom kalpas without beginning until this day, I, so-and-so, have cast off this body and taken on another, and the offenses of the three karmic actions I have committed are measureless and boundless, concealed within me. Moreover, the sins committed by my ancestors, as well as those for which I, so-and-so, now suffer retribution—relying upon the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthies, I pray that they may extend their deliverance, that the three karmic actions may be absolved at their source, and that the six senses may be purified. May I be delivered from the punishments of the Nine Hells below: the wind-knives that flay the body, the iron halberds that pierce the heart, the molten bronze poured into the mouth, and the tearing out of the tongue. May I be delivered and liberated.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves before the Three Treasures of the Ten Directions, the True and Perfect.\n\n**Chapter on Releasing Enmity**\n\nThe Most High addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, saying: Of all the sufferings of sinking into evil destinies and the bitter toils of birth and death, none is so difficult to escape, nor so deeply entangled in mutual retribution, as the sin of enmity. All beings in the world of abandoning the worthy and forsaking the good have yet to awaken to the good Dao. All day long, they diligently increase their karmic deeds, unaware that harboring enmity brings no benefit to themselves. They merely see matters before their eyes and give rise to ignorance. Or they inwardly nurse grievances, vainly disturbing the heart’s core.\n\nLittle do they know that the gods who govern fate and oversee all within heaven and earth and the void, along with the spirits within the human body who record transgressions, record their resentments and submit them to the Celestial Palace, where their offenses are determined...\n\nWind and rain, thunder and lightning, severe cold and scorching heat—all give rise to enmity. Lords and parents, teachers and elders, the six relations and kin—all give rise to enmity. Fields and gardens, homes and dwellings, the five grains and five flavors—all give rise to enmity. Hemp and silk, brocade and fine cloth, fruits and vegetables—all give rise to enmity. Friends and companions, contending for fame and profit—all give rise to enmity. Trading and bartering, buying cheap and selling dear—all give rise to enmity. Public and private litigation, crafty arguments and twisted words—through repentance and confession, the aforementioned enmities may be extinguished. The sins of enmity shall all be dissolved. Let each reflect and examine, that future matters may be amended. Cease from further transgressions, and be spared from endless cycles of karmic retribution, life after life. Whether sinking or stagnating, whether as human or celestial, the roots of evil shall be forever severed, and one shall roam free and at ease, no longer entangled. Reverently bow to the Ten Directions’ Most High, Perfect, and True Three Treasures.\n\nHere ends the second scroll of *The Supreme Numinous Treasure’s Ten Directions’ Responsive Invocation of the Heavenly Worthy’s Repentance Ritual*.\nHere begins the tenth scroll of *The Supreme Numinous Treasure’s Ten Directions’ Responsive Invocation of the Heavenly Worthy’s Repentance Ritual*: \"The Chapter on Teachers, Lords, and Parents.\"\n\nThe Supreme One addressed the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, saying: All sentient beings receive transformation and nurturance from the great Dao of Heaven and Earth, entrusting their forms to their parents. Their parents carry them in their arms, nurse them at the breast, and endure cold and heat, darkness and light, sparing no effort in their upbringing. Yet when they grow, they become stained by evil destinies, indulging in lust, craving, and desire, swayed by joy and anger, sorrow and vexation. The three karmic actions and ten evils, the six senses and six dusts, the six entrances and six consciousnesses, the six roots and six thieves—gradually, they become inwardly and outwardly defiled, accumulating transgressions and burdens. They sink into worlds that forsake the worthy and mingle with the wicked, drowning in the dark prison of the river of love and death. Though they possess human form, in the myriad torments of hell, they differ not from birds and beasts. If not for a teacher to shatter their doubts and dissolve their obstructions, to dispel their attachments and remove their delusions, to reveal the great Dharma of the Three Vehicles, the myriad wondrous precepts, the scriptures and registers, talismans and charts, the rituals of repentance and merit, the secret formulas of longevity, and the feathered texts of deliverance—guiding them step by step, restraining and cultivating their practice, from near to far, transcending the mundane to enter sageliness, forming boundless karmic ties, and liberating their burdened bodies—then how could they ascend to offer blessings to the seven generations of ancestors and descend to aid all beings? Thus, teachers possess the grace of delivering the world, and parents possess the power of giving life. Their grace and power are towering and vast, boundless and immeasurable. Rightly should one reflect upon them, reverently obey, and cherish filial devotion.\n\nYet how base and shallow are sentient beings, bringing ruin upon themselves! In serving their teachers, lords, and parents, they lack gentleness, compliance, reverence, and care, nor do they offer filial devotion and love. From beginning to end, they are disobedient and unceasing. Their every action breeds resentment, and all becomes transgression. They feel no shame for failing to repay the grace of deliverance, nor do they rise to requite the debt of birth. If they persist in such evils, their sins grow heavier still. Without repentance and redirection, how can the source of their offenses be cleansed?\n\nToday, so-and-so awakens, repents, and confesses: From beginningless time until this present life, whether abandoning the body to receive the Dharma, seeking the Dao and following a teacher, acting for oneself or others, or widely transmitting the scriptures and precepts—there has been no intent to honor the teacher, nor has there been faith and devotion. Broken vows and violated precepts have accumulated faults and multiplied transgressions. Or toward parents, the heart of reverence, filial devotion, and nurturance has been lost, and the grace of birth and nursing forgotten. The sins described above are boundless and immeasurable, binding one in the unseen realm and summoning karmic retribution. Yet by relying on the vast and divine majesty and the infinite power of compassion, they may be cleansed through repentance, all sins dissolved, and the roots of goodness strengthened. If the deceased are reborn among humans, may their affinity with the Dao be firm, their awakening to the true vehicle swift, and may they always dwell in peace, never falling into evil destinies. With wholehearted devotion, earnest resolve, and sincere reverence, they offer themselves to their teachers, lords, and parents, and with faith, they pay homage to the Ten Directions’ Greatly Compassionate and Supreme Worthy.\n\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Great Sage, Perfectly True, Primordial Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of

Worthies of the Ten Directions and all the Great Perfected Sages.\nSo-and-so today arouses the supreme intention for the Dao, relying on the power of great compassion, and in accordance with the invocation, so be it.\n\nIt is earnestly hoped that in past and present lives, the masters who transmitted the Dao, whether already divine or not yet sagely, whether already enlightened or not yet enlightened, may their Dao-heart remain firm, unshaken by ten thousand trials, swiftly entering the Great Vehicle to realize the eternal Dao, neither born nor extinguished, neither sinking nor decaying.\n\nIt is further hoped that in past kalpas and the present life, the seven generations of parents, whether sunken or stagnant, whether already reborn or not yet reborn, may ascend into the Dharma-gate.\nMay all evil and myriad karmic conditions be simultaneously liberated, transcending the mundane to enter sageliness, uniting with the Dao to become perfected.\nThey bow their heads to the Orthodox and True Three Treasures of the Ten Directions.\n\n**The Hells Chapter**\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct bowed his head and addressed the Most High, saying: \"The wondrous discourses of all chapters have been heard and understood. Yet I have not learned how many kinds of hells there are, and how their severity varies.\"\n\nThe Most High replied: \"Since cultivation has distinctions, how could the hells lack degrees of severity? When a person dies, the Earth Bureau reports to the Heavenly Emperor-Kings of the Upper Realms and the Three Primordials and Four Offices, who determine the register of sins and assign their corresponding severity.\"\n\nAgain, he bowed his head and respectfully inquired: \"Do all the dead pass through hell?\"\nThe Most High answered: \"Those who have accumulated good deeds and possess merit have their names already recorded in the registers of heaven, and their forms are transformed to receive blessed rebirth. How could they pass through hell again? Only those who have accumulated evil, after their lives end, must face retribution. Some enter the Fengdu or Mount Tai’s twenty-six hells; some enter the Nine Dark or Eighteen Hells; some enter the Eastern Wind and Thunder Hell; some enter the Southern Fire and Obstruction Hell; some enter the Western Metal Blade Hell; some enter the Northern Cold Ice Hell; some enter the Northeastern Whipping and Beating Hell; some enter the Southeastern Scorching Hell; some enter the Southwestern Hot Iron Bed Hell; some enter the Northwestern Cauldron Boiling Hell; some enter the Central Axe and Halberd Hell; some enter the Lower Dung and Filth Hell; some enter the Heaven-Watching Hell; some enter the Level Heaven Hell; some enter the Spontaneous Hell; some enter the Nine Level Hells; some enter the Azure Edict Hell; some enter the Dark Heaven Hell; some enter the Nine Orthodox Hells; some enter the Dark Sands Hell; some enter the August Heaven Hell; some enter the Prohibition and Punishment Hell; some enter the Northern Dark Hell; some enter the Statutes and Decrees Hell; some enter the Avīci Hell; some enter the Female Azure Hell; some enter the Heavenly Unity Hell; some enter the Supreme Dark and Mysterious Hell; some enter the Five Marchmounts’ Hells; some enter the Four Seas and Nine Rivers’ Prisons.\n\nIn such hells as these, the dark prisons are bitterly confining, the long nights are freezing, fierce flames and flying winds, swift thunder and startling quakes, sharp blades and sword-spears, iron rods and metal hammers, copper pillars and iron beds—embracing or lying upon them, poisonous birds and ferocious beasts with frost fangs and snow teeth, mutually inflicting torture. Even unto the myriad streams of the Ash River, the thousand-fathom poisonous waves, soaking within them, the pain is boundless. Fierce wardens drive them on, punishing divine soldiers, hundreds of millions in number, subjecting them to every kind of torture. In a single day, they die ten thousand deaths and are reborn ten thousand times. At such a time, how could regret avail? After enduring for a kalpa, their sins exhausted, they are reborn. Some become donkeys, oxen, mules, or horses, ridden by humans; some become feathered, scaled, or shelled creatures, slaughtered by humans. After enduring this retribution, they may regain human form, yet remain foolish, ugly, and incomplete in spirit. Dwelling only in lowly conditions, with limbs maimed, eyes blind, ears deaf, mute, or afflicted with madness, illness, hunger, cold, and starvation, lacking clothing and food, subjected to punishments and laws, they constantly dwell in suffering, barely distinct from beasts, never at peace. All this arises from past karma—how could they escape it? Without repentance, how could they be freed?\n\nTherefore, with single-minded devotion, prostrate and earnest, they dedicate this to their masters, parents, ancestors, and kin, and further to so-and-so, extending to all sentient beings, repenting of hellish sins and paying homage to the Great Compassionate Supreme Worthy.\n\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Beginning, the Great Sage and Perfectly True.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Unity.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Abides in the Primordial Form.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Divine Activity.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Protects the Multitudes of Spirits.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Terrace and Diligent Virtue.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Lofty Stability and Wisdom.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Silent Recollection and Non-Action.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Hidden Radiance in Victorious Splendor.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Roams in Stillness.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Concentrates Spirit in the Purple Palace.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Clarity and True Purity.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Subtle Vision of the Purple Ultimate.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Void and Constant Stillness.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Profound Obscurity and Divine Transformation.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Peace and Bliss.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Most Victorious Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Upright Serenity and Harmonious Radiance.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Vast Flowering Virtue.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Pure Perfection.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Harmonious Radiance and Hidden Wonders.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Transcends the Dark Boundary.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from the Eight Difficulties.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Rides the Light and Floats in the Void.\n\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Congeals Spirit and Generates Wisdom.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Serene Appearance and Pure Stillness.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds from the Utmost Void.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers Across the Dark Sea.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Soaring Form and Countenance.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Embodies True Reality.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Dissolves Demonic Trials.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Awakens to the Kalpas.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Governs the Mysterious Palace.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Attends the Banquet at Fusang.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Pacifies and Comforts the Myriad Spirits.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Power and Treasured Reality.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Southern Cinnabar Wisdom.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Reveals the Mysterious and Hidden.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Initiates Divine Transformations.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of a Hundredfold Adornments.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Salvation from Suffering.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Liberation from Sin.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Universal Relief.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Wondrous Practice.\n\nTake refuge in the Most Supreme Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, and all the Great Perfected Sages.\nI, so-and-so, together with my masters, parents, clan relatives, and all sentient beings—from beginningless time until this day—have never awakened, and have accumulated transgressions through our actions. I fear that after the end of this life, we may enter these great hells, endure such retribution, and know no peace.\n\nMay all these transgressions be wholly dissolved from this single repentance, may we never pass through the realms of suffering, and may our good affinities grow. May the deceased be reborn, their dark prisons dismissed, and may they naturally attain bliss, forever departing from the evil destinies.\n\nI bow my head to the Orthodox Three Treasures of the Ten Directions.\n\n**Chapter on Vows**\n\nThe Most High addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Practice, saying: \"The wondrous principles I have just expounded—each concerning sin and merit—have their respective distinctions. Each practice of cultivation reveals its essential path; each Dharma-gate is universally opened.\"\n\nThus have I spoken for the sake of all beings—words direct and principles manifest, text flowing and meaning coherent—so that delusion may be dispelled, doubt shattered, and the mundane transcended to enter sagehood. All this lies solely in this path: single-minded sincerity to attain awakening.\n\nYet I ever contemplate how all beings fail to broadly generate great vows. With every thought, they should succor others; with each念, deliver people. Whether human or celestial, all should arise in equality. As for body, mind, speech, and intention—eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and faculties—let them ever remain pure, steadfast, and unyielding. In movement, repose, waking, and rest, let them all be practiced. Diminish self for the benefit of others; place others before oneself. Accumulate merit in the body, ever engaging in purification and repentance. Once the roots of transgression are eradicated, the sprouts of goodness daily arise—how wondrous indeed!\n\nI reverently bow to the Compassionate Honored One, then generate great vows.\n\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Great Sage, Perfectly Realized Primordial Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Illuminates the Profound and Establishes Principle.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Five Clouds’ Floating Chariot.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Seven Jeweled Grove.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Cherishes and Loves All.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dharma-Treasury of Stillness and Emptiness.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Purple Sun’s Jeweled Seal.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Concentrated Truth and Wondrous Refinement.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Perfect and Complete Wisdom.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious and Solitary Awakening.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Bestows the Dharma-Teaching.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Receives the Jade Script’s Mandate.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Quiescence and Purity.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity and Golden Countenance.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Free from Attachment.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Cloud-Shade.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Moistens with the True Source.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Accords with Conditions and Gathers.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Limitless Nurturance.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Pure Radiance and Restful Splendor.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Transcends Form and Matter.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Shadow-Transformation in the Empty Palace.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Self-Mastery in the Human and Celestial Realms.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Numinous Longevity.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Empyrean’s Guest Court.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Vermilion Lotus’ Wondrous Countenance.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Left Mystery’s Perfection.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Luminous Qi Soaring Through the Empyrean.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Simplicity’s Dispersed Forms.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Whose Wisdom Precedes the Myriad Things.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Illuminates the Boundless.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Cinnabar Clouds’ Unfurled Splendor.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Floating Jade’s Radiance.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Banquet on Mount Ao.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Purple Sun’s Ministers.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Truth’s Gathering.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Heavenly Chimes’ Resonant Melody.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Forgiveness.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Teachings.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dragon Chariot’s Procession.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Salvation from Suffering.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and the Supreme Ultimate.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Universal Salvation.\nWith sincere faith, I bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Wondrous Practice.\n\nHaving completed these reverent bows to the Heavenly Worthies of Great Compassion in the Ten Directions—one thousand two hundred in all—and to the Perfected Ones of Great Compassion—one hundred twenty in all—I once more prostrate and take refuge.\n\nThrough this boundless merit and infinite true instruction, I, so-and-so, today generate the unsurpassed Dao-mind, dedicating it to my teacher, parents, clan, and kin, as well as to the three evil destinies, five sufferings, nine dark prisons, and six paths—even to the flying, crawling, wriggling, and all sentient beings. I generate this great vow:\n\nMay the Great Dao flourish and transform, the Dharma-teachings circulate widely, and all living beings hear and behold them, awaken to the Dao, attain perfection, and obtain manifold blessings.\nMay Heaven and Earth endure long, their shelter and support boundless; may the sun, moon, and stars illumine without end, their cycles harmonious and revolutions unceasing.\nMay kings govern with equality, their actions accord with the Dao’s intent; may ruler and ministers rejoice in harmony, and their reigns and descendants prosper.\nMay the nine provinces be pure and solemn, malevolent vapors forever stilled; may the four seas be serene and tranquil, and the civilizing transformation of Hua and Yi vast.\nMay the four seasons follow their sequence, the hundred grains flourish abundantly; may the people’s customs be prosperous and peaceful, and calamities never arise.\nMay mountains and rivers manifest auspicious signs, the land be harmonious and fitting; may the five phases unfold in harmony, and the myriad things flourish and thrive.\nMay all earthly spirits and deities generate the Dao-mind and attain the true Dao.\nMay the Dragon Kings of rivers, seas, mountains, and streams each arise in goodness, benefiting and aiding all, ascending in rank and position.\nMay the mountain spirits, stone demons, and myriad earthly and wooden specters transform their forms and natures, awaken to goodness, and return to truth.\nMay all flying, crawling, and wriggling beings each generate spiritual nature.\nMay faithful men and women’s Dao-minds be steadfast, entering the Dharma-gate, women transforming into male forms, intelligent and self-mastered.\nMay those who dwell in mountains or hide in markets, who study the Dao and seek immortality, keep their true minds ever firm and swiftly enter the Great Vehicle.\nMay those afflicted with chronic illnesses and grievous ailments attain peace and tranquility; may the mute, deaf, and blind gain intelligence and clarity; may the crippled and lame stretch and rest at ease.\nMay all three karmic actions, life after life, awaken to realization, never generating evil roots, and avoid falling into realms of suffering.\nMay all entangled in enmity, hatred, and resentment be released; may the foolish attain wisdom, the miserly learn to give and benefit, the arrogant generate reverence, the generous remain unwavering in thought, and those who perform good deeds swiftly accomplish them.\nMay all beings awaken to the illusory body and cultivate the true and proper body.\nAbandon the body of affliction, obtain the upright body.\nAbandon the body of desire, obtain the joyous body.\nAbandon the body of karmic transgression, obtain the body of blessed retribution.\nAbandon the body of outflows, obtain the unobstructed body.\n\nMay all beings abandon the body entangled in grievance and obtain the carefree body.\nAbandon the short-lived body and obtain the long-lived body.\n\nMoreover, may all beings awaken to their fundamental mind, emerging from ignorance.\nAbandon the mind of anger and hatred, and generate the mind of joy.\nAbandon the mind of jealousy and envy, and generate the mind of harmony and delight.\nAbandon the mind of delusion and malice, and generate the mind of compassion and wisdom.\nAbandon the mind of killing and harm, and generate the mind of pity and empathy.\nAbandon the mind of miserliness and greed, and generate the mind of devotion.\nAbandon the mind of falsity and deception, and generate the mind of truth and sincerity.\n\nMoreover, may all beings awaken to their emotions and intentions, emerging from the shadows of the aggregates.\nAbandon base and malevolent emotions, and generate vast and magnanimous emotions.\nAbandon sorrowful and afflicted emotions, and generate serene and untroubled emotions.\nAbandon craving and desirous emotions, and generate pure and true emotions.\nAbandon deceitful and perverse emotions, and generate upright and authentic emotions.\n\nMoreover, may all beings awaken to their speech, emerging from insatiability.\nAbandon the mouth of gluttony and taste, and obtain the mouth that constantly recites true scriptures.\nAbandon the mouth that destroys goodness and promotes evil, and obtain the mouth that expounds true meaning.\nAbandon the mouth of divisive speech and strife, and obtain the mouth of compassion and equanimity.\nAbandon the mouth of curses and slander, and obtain the mouth of praise and hymns.\n\nMoreover, may all beings abandon the eyes of desire and obtain the eyes of wisdom.\nAbandon the eyes of anger and hatred, and generate the eyes of compassion.\nAbandon the eyes that perceive evil, and generate the eyes that behold goodness.\nAbandon the eyes of prying and scrutiny, and generate the eyes of the true Dao.\n\nMoreover, may all beings abandon the ears that hear evil and obtain the ears that draw near to goodness.\nAbandon the ears that delight in lewdness, and obtain the ears of purity.\nAbandon the impure ears, and obtain the ears that truly receive the Dharma.\n\nMoreover, may all beings’ noses abandon杂息 and constantly receive the qi of celestial offerings, fragrant flowers, and wondrous blossoms.\n\nMoreover, may all beings abandon all perverse, evil, and reckless thoughts—false and improper imaginings—and constantly attain refined, upright, and single-minded thoughts.\n\nMoreover, may all beings be free from illness and affliction, free from the cycles of rebirth and transformation, free from hunger and thirst, free from calamity and misfortune, free from cold and heat, free from distress and suffering, and constantly abide in peace and bliss.\n\nMoreover, may all entangled in grievance, debt of life, debt of wealth, debt of benevolence, and debt of righteousness forever sever their bonds and each attain liberation.\n\nMoreover, may all shackles, fetters, and prisons, all dangers, hardships, and distress, be completely dissolved.\n\nMoreover, may all evil persons arouse the mind of goodness, and may all three disasters be forever extinguished.\n\nMay the ten-directional hells transform into the ten utmost pure lands, and may all great hells become boundless jeweled realms.\nMay the tremors of hell transform into celestial music, and may the raging fires of hell become cool breezes.\nMay the icy cold of hell turn into the warmth of spring, and may the cauldrons of hell become lotus ponds.\nMay the boiling waters of hell transform into Dharma waters, and may the knife mountains of hell become lotus peaks.\nMay the spears and halberds of hell turn into banners and standards, and may the fire chariots of hell become jeweled carriages.\nMay the ash rivers of hell transform into jade pools, and may the suffering wheels of hell become Dharma wheels.\nMay the karmic winds of hell turn into pure breezes, and may the filth of hell become fragrant mountains.\nMay the hells of swallowing fire and eating coals transform into ambrosia entering the heart, and may the crushing rocks become cloud ladders leading to the Dao.\nMay all the suffering places of hell become realms of bliss.\nUpon the river of desire, may rosy clouds form bridges; within the sea of suffering, may clouds serve as boats and oars.\nMay the records of hellish sins be entirely abolished, and may all suffering beings attain liberation at once.\nMay the hellish ghost officials ascend as immortals, and may the hellish ghosts and spirits ascend as celestial companions.\n\nMoreover, may so-and-so, life after life, receive and relinquish the body.\nMay this vow be firmly established and unwavering.\nThough heaven and earth may end, this vow shall have no end.\nThough kalpas may be exhausted, this vow shall not be exhausted.\nThough mountains and valleys may shift, this vow shall not shift.\nThough rivers and streams may dry up, this vow shall not dry up.\nMay humans and gods together revere it, and may the living and the dead alike rely upon it.\nTogether may they assemble in truth and authenticity, and accomplish the supreme Dao.\n\nAt that time, the Wondrously Practiced Perfected One, having heard these causes and conditions, bowed in reverence and uttered this verse:\n\nThe Most Sagely One reveals the secret essence,\nDelivering all humans and gods.\nThe great vow is inexhaustible through kalpas,\nIts merit profound beyond profundity.\nIn life and death, all find joy,\nAnd demon kings naturally preserve their integrity.\nNeither this nor that—yet together\nThey accomplish the supreme immortals.\n\nWhen the Most High Lord of the Dao had finished expounding the scripture, celestial music resounded, and the perfected sages, with their retinues, returned to the upper palace. The ten directions became serene and still. Thereupon, the Wondrously Practiced Perfected One, the Heavenly Thearchs, and all the perfected multitudes rejoiced, bowed in reverence, and vowed to uphold and propagate it for the salvation of all. Each inscribed it in dragon script and phoenix seal, encased in golden caskets and jade wrappings, and titled it: *The Most High Numinous Treasure Repentance Sutra of the Ten Directional Response and Appellation of the Heavenly Worthy*. They bowed in reverence to the Three Treasures of the Ten Directions, True and Authentic.\n\nThus concludes the tenth fascicle of *The Most High Numinous Treasure Repentance Sutra of the Ten Directional Response and Appellation of the Heavenly Worthy*.",

      "translated_text": "The *Repentance Ritual of the Most High Numinous Treasure Ten Directions Responsive Titles Celestial Worthy*\n\n**Title:** *Repentance Ritual of the Most High Numinous Treasure Ten Directions Responsive Titles Celestial Worthy* (Ten fascicles; originally comprising Fascicle One and Fascicles Three through Nine).\n\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan* Section, *Weiyi* Category.\n\n---\n\n**Fascicle Two of the Repentance Ritual of the Most High Numinous Treasure Ten Directions Responsive Titles Celestial Worthy**\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, having heard the Most High expound the karmic causes of good and evil, and the matters of retribution being settled, bowed in reverence and praise. With utmost sincerity and earnestness, he addressed the Most High again, saying:\n\n\"Sentient beings, deluded and ignorant, are enmeshed in the snares of the world and cannot awaken. They remain trapped in the cycle of sin, drifting through birth and death, ever abiding in suffering. Gazing up to the Merciful Worthy, they yearn for enlightenment, that in future lives as men and women, they may turn their hearts to the good Dao and not fall into the Three Wretched Realms.\"\n\nThe Most High replied:\n\n\"All sentient beings, casting off one body to receive another, have for kalpas beyond measure allowed their bodies, minds, thoughts, and intentions—along with their eyes, ears, noses, and mouths—to accumulate manifold sins. Deluded and ensnared by sensory contact, they commit transgressions both inwardly and outwardly. The six senses arise in turn, each begetting the next. The roots of sin grow ever deeper, and with every thought, they commit boundless wrongs—sins as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges. These ingrained habits, long accumulated, reside within the body. From past causes to present ones, from kalpa to kalpa, they cannot be reckoned. Yet with a single thought of turning the heart, all may be purified.\n\nIt is like a bright mirror, its surface obscured by dust and grime, all manner of impurities gathered to cloud its clarity, leaving it dimmed within and without. But should it one day encounter a skilled craftsman who wipes, polishes, and washes it, its inner and outer surfaces will gleam with radiance, illuminating all near and far, restored to its original brightness. Why is this so? Because its nature was originally pure.\n\nSentient beings are likewise: their spirits are fundamentally pure, free from all defilement. Yet after receiving form, they gradually become stained by the dust of inner and outer impurities, accumulating transgressions. The six roots, six desires, six emotions, six entrances, six defilements, six thieves, six dusts, and six consciousnesses discriminate between right and wrong, recklessly committing foul and corrupt acts. Darkness spreads within and without, and their true nature is lost. Adrift in the cycle of death and rebirth, they perpetually generate the causes of sin. When retribution and karmic conditions converge, they enter hell, suffering myriad torments, sinking for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nOut of compassion, I take pity on sentient beings. Thus, from kalpa to kalpa, I manifest in the world—now as a sage, now as an ordinary being—assuming various responsive forms to teach and transform them. I propagate scriptures and precepts, awakening and delivering them, that they may escape suffering. Yet sentient beings, lacking good fortune, fail to awaken. Even the sages, immortals, and perfected beings of the heavens constantly desire that people cleanse evil and cultivate good, for then benevolent spirits will protect and guard them. If sins remain bound to the body and one does not repent, malevolent spirits will bring calamity, and they will suffer in birth and death.\n\nAll sentient beings know only to adorn their faces, clothing, hands, and feet outwardly, yet do not know to cleanse their bodies and minds inwardly to dissolve the bonds of sin. If, like the face, hands, feet, and clothing, they diligently purify themselves, then good will surely find its place, and what fault could reach them? Now, I shall distinguish these matters further, and each should repent accordingly.\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Repentance for Killing Living Beings**\n\nThe Most High addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, saying:\n\n\"All sentient beings, past and present, unmindful of compassion, kill and harm living beings, devouring them insatiably. Whether for parents, themselves, their children, grandchildren, or kinfolk, or for following omens of good and ill fortune, gathering in villages and hamlets, they kill living beings beyond count. Whether for offering sacrifices to ancestors, praying to the earth gods, or celebrating at the hearth, they kill living beings without measure.\n\nThey kill cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs, donkeys, horses, chickens, and other domesticated creatures; or deer, foxes, hares, tigers, leopards, jackals, and wolves, and other beasts of the mountains and wilds; or geese, ducks, crows, magpies, turtledoves, kites, owls, teals, egrets, and other flying birds; or insects, snakes, vipers, scorpions, wasps, centipedes, millipedes, crickets, ants, and the like; or soft-shelled turtles, terrapins, tortoises, alligators, fish, shrimp, sturgeon, crabs, snails, clams, frogs, and other aquatic creatures; or dung beetles, midges, moths, caterpillars, earthworms, and other small insects; or mosquitoes, fleas, lice, mayflies, and other ephemeral creatures.\n\nThey fly hawks and unleash hounds, exhausting forests and draining marshes to kill living beings; or set nets and spread snares, or set fires to mountains to kill living beings; or wield bows and arrows, knives and staves to kill living beings; or, whether sitting, lying, walking, or standing, crush living beings with their hands or trample them underfoot; or build houses and construct walls, killing living beings; or plow fields and sow crops, digging pits and excavating earth, killing living beings; or cut grass and level ground, gather firewood and fell trees, killing living beings; or pluck flowers and pick fruit, raise silkworms and dry cocoons, killing living beings; or light lamps and kindle fires, turning their backs to the light and facing the dark, killing living beings; or divert water into burrows or pour boiling water on the ground, killing living beings; or drink water, eat rice, wash their hair, or bathe their bodies, killing living beings; or rip open wombs and break eggs, severing sinews and shattering bones, killing living beings; or open their mouths, form intentions, stretch out their hands, or move their feet, killing living beings; or before the Celestial Worthies, the great Dao, the true scriptures, and wondrous dharma, or all the sages, kill living beings; or under the three luminaries of heaven and earth, kill living beings; or on the Three Primes, Eight Festivals, Ten Straightfast Days, or during fasts, or in wind, rain, darkness, and gloom, kill living beings; or within sacred altars, numinous temples, or upon the seats of dharma assemblies, kill living beings; or in anger, sorrow, joy, or revelry, kill living beings; or when compounding medicines to heal the sick, kill living beings; or when life ends in their hands or death comes by the blade; or in military campaigns; or for vengeance; or relying on power and might.\"",

Failing to reflect upon one’s body, which receives the nurture of parents, the instruction of teachers, yet does not uphold filial devotion. Failing to reflect upon one’s body, which receives the protection and transformation of kings and great ministers, yet does not cultivate loyalty and respect. Failing to reflect upon one’s body, which is recorded in the registers of sin and merit by all the sages, yet does not believe in the retribution of good and evil, assuming all is naturally enduring, remaining unaware, unafraid, unrepentant, unguarded, and careless—only craving refinement, indulging in evil influences, committing boundless killings, thefts, and sexual misconduct, violating norms and disrupting order, drinking to excess and acting wantonly.\n\nSecond, the sins of mental karma: the fire of ignorance burns ceaselessly. The six senses and three delusions race without restraint; from this arise all evils. Or conceiving the thought of stealing from the lofty sages, the sacred scriptures, secret registers, numinous shrines, pure precincts, gardens, flowers, fruits, and offerings to the Dharma. Or conceiving the thought of stealing from the state treasuries, the wise and the noble, as well as the lowly and foolish, all manner of things. Any object, if coveted in a single thought, constitutes theft. False imaginings of good and evil arise within; retribution for good and evil manifests without. Or conceiving thoughts of defying the Three Luminaries, belittling the multitude of sages. Or conceiving schemes in secret, plotting to wrong the virtuous. Or conceiving the thought of killing living beings, willfully harming creatures. Or conceiving deceitful, cunning, and treacherous thoughts, engaging in villainy and slander. Or conceiving envy toward those superior to oneself, harboring jealousy and self-importance. Or conceiving the thought of teaching others to do evil, causing them to transgress righteousness. Or conceiving the thought of ruining others’ successes, obstructing their good deeds. Or conceiving the thought of separating others from their kin, severing their bonds of affection.",

      "translated_text": "Little do they know that the gods who govern fate and oversee all within heaven and earth and the void, along with the spirits within the human body who record transgressions, record their resentments and submit them to the Celestial Palace, where their offenses are determined. Delivered to the courts of the netherworld, once they enter evil destinies, they endure every kind of suffering. Reborn among humans, they again become enemies. Age after age, life after life, without end—all is self-created and self-endured, as inseparable as form and shadow. How could one escape?\n\nThus, the perfected ones, in great matters, relinquish rank and even life itself; in small matters, they forsake adornments and sever attachments, strictly upholding emptiness and stillness, refraining from contention between self and others—all precisely to eliminate this enmity. Moreover, among one’s closest kin, where filial devotion and deep affection should naturally abound, discord instead prevails in many cases. This is all due to the weight of enmity from past lives, which causes such conditions in this present existence.\n\nThose who serve as teachers, revered parents, elders, or superiors often impose expectations of service and repayment, and if these are not met, resentment arises. Those who are children, descendants, or family members often expect kindness, love, and nurturance, and if these fall short, resentment is born. Without expectations, how could resentment exist?\n\nResentment may arise toward heaven and earth, the Three Luminaries, and the exalted perfected sages; toward wind and rain, thunder and lightning, bitter cold and scorching heat; toward rulers, parents, teachers, and elders, or the six relations of kin; toward fields and gardens, homes and dwellings, the five grains and five flavors; toward hemp and silk, fine fabrics, fruits and vegetables; toward friends and associates, in struggles for fame and profit; in buying and selling, where prices are low on purchase and high on sale; in public and private disputes, with cunning words and twisted arguments.\n\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Numinous Primordial Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Treasure Radiance Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Fragrant Virtue Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Wisdom-Sun Heavenly Worthy of Universal Reception.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Upright and Tranquil True Form Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Fans the True Wind.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Contemplation.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Golden Pillar Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Good Intentions.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Great Illuminating Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Majestic Virtue and Pure Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Mysterious Compassion and Salvific Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Treasure Radiance Illuminating the Boundless Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Lion’s Majestic Demeanor.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Pervades Merit and Virtue.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Universally Illuminating Contemplative Heavenly Worthy.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Heavenly Care and Virtue.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Light Dispelling Afflictions.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Stillness.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Augmenting Expedient Means.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy, Lord of Sandalwood Virtue.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Pure Treasure.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Treasure Eloquence.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Light Pervading the Darkest Reaches.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Opens the Sagely Power.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Void and Form.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Immortal Spirits and Pristine Simplicity.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Five Clouds Ascending the Path.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Remembers the Deluded Multitudes.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Salvation from Suffering.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Liberation from Sin.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Universal Salvation.\nWith sincere heart, we pay homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion and Wondrous Conduct.\n\nWe take refuge in the Most High Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and all the great perfected sages.\n\nFrom kalpas without beginning until this day, I, so-and-so, have cast off this body and taken on another, and the offenses of the three karmic actions I have committed are measureless and boundless, concealed within me. Moreover, the sins committed by my ancestors, as well as those for which I, so-and-so, now suffer retribution—relying upon the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthies, I pray that they may extend their deliverance, that the three karmic actions may be absolved at their source, and that the six senses may be purified. May I be delivered from the punishments of the Nine Hells below: the wind-knives that flay the body, the iron halberds that pierce the heart, the molten bronze poured into the mouth, and the tearing out of the tongue. May I be delivered and liberated.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves before the Three Treasures of the Ten Directions, the True and Perfect.\n\n**Chapter on Releasing Enmity**\n\nThe Most High addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, saying: Of all the sufferings of sinking into evil destinies and the bitter toils of birth and death, none is so difficult to escape, nor so deeply entangled in mutual retribution, as the sin of enmity.

      "translated_text": "Wind and rain, thunder and lightning, severe cold and scorching heat—all give rise to enmity. Lords and parents, teachers and elders, the six relations and kin—all give rise to enmity. Fields and gardens, homes and dwellings, the five grains and five flavors—all give rise to enmity. Hemp and silk, brocade and fine cloth, fruits and vegetables—all give rise to enmity. Friends and companions, contending for fame and profit—all give rise to enmity. Trading and bartering, buying cheap and selling dear—all give rise to enmity. Public and private litigation, crafty arguments and twisted words—through repentance and confession, the aforementioned enmities may be extinguished. The sins of enmity shall all be dissolved. Let each reflect and examine, that future matters may be amended. Cease from further transgressions, and be spared from endless cycles of karmic retribution, life after life. Whether sinking or stagnating, whether as human or celestial, the roots of evil shall be forever severed, and one shall roam free and at ease, no longer entangled. Reverently bow to the Ten Directions’ Most High, Perfect, and True Three Treasures.\n\nHere ends the second scroll of *The Supreme Numinous Treasure’s Ten Directions’ Responsive Invocation of the Heavenly Worthy’s Repentance Ritual*.\nHere begins the tenth scroll of *The Supreme Numinous Treasure’s Ten Directions’ Responsive Invocation of the Heavenly Worthy’s Repentance Ritual*: \"The Chapter on Teachers, Lords, and Parents.\"\n\nThe Supreme One addressed the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, saying: All sentient beings receive transformation and nurturance from the great Dao of Heaven and Earth, entrusting their forms to their parents. Their parents carry them in their arms, nurse them at the breast, and endure cold and heat, darkness and light, sparing no effort in their upbringing. Yet when they grow, they become stained by evil destinies, indulging in lust, craving, and desire, swayed by joy and anger, sorrow and vexation. The three karmic actions and ten evils, the six senses and six dusts, the six entrances and six consciousnesses, the six roots and six thieves—gradually, they become inwardly and outwardly defiled, accumulating transgressions and burdens. They sink into worlds that forsake the worthy and mingle with the wicked, drowning in the dark prison of the river of love and death. Though they possess human form, in the myriad torments of hell, they differ not from birds and beasts. If not for a teacher to shatter their doubts and dissolve their obstructions, to dispel their attachments and remove their delusions, to reveal the great Dharma of the Three Vehicles, the myriad wondrous precepts, the scriptures and registers, talismans and charts, the rituals of repentance and merit, the secret formulas of longevity, and the feathered texts of deliverance—guiding them step by step, restraining and cultivating their practice, from near to far, transcending the mundane to enter sageliness, forming boundless karmic ties, and liberating their burdened bodies—then how could they ascend to offer blessings to the seven generations of ancestors and descend to aid all beings? Thus, teachers possess the grace of delivering the world, and parents possess the power of giving life. Their grace and power are towering and vast, boundless and immeasurable. Rightly should one reflect upon them, reverently obey, and cherish filial devotion.\n\nYet how base and shallow are sentient beings, bringing ruin upon themselves! In serving their teachers, lords, and parents, they lack gentleness, compliance, reverence, and care, nor do they offer filial devotion and love. From beginning to end, they are disobedient and unceasing. Their every action breeds resentment, and all becomes transgression. They feel no shame for failing to repay the grace of deliverance, nor do they rise to requite the debt of birth. If they persist in such evils, their sins grow heavier still. Without repentance and redirection, how can the source of their offenses be cleansed?\n\nToday, so-and-so awakens, repents, and confesses: From beginningless time until this present life, whether abandoning the body to receive the Dharma, seeking the Dao and following a teacher, acting for oneself or others, or widely transmitting the scriptures and precepts—there has been no intent to honor the teacher, nor has there been faith and devotion. Broken vows and violated precepts have accumulated faults and multiplied transgressions. Or toward parents, the heart of reverence, filial devotion, and nurturance has been lost, and the grace of birth and nursing forgotten. The sins described above are boundless and immeasurable, binding one in the unseen realm and summoning karmic retribution. Yet by relying on the vast and divine majesty and the infinite power of compassion, they may be cleansed through repentance, all sins dissolved, and the roots of goodness strengthened. If the deceased are reborn among humans, may their affinity with the Dao be firm, their awakening to the true vehicle swift, and may they always dwell in peace, never falling into evil destinies. With wholehearted devotion, earnest resolve, and sincere reverence, they offer themselves to their teachers, lords, and parents, and with faith, they pay homage to the Ten Directions’ Greatly Compassionate and Supreme Worthy.\n\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Great Sage, Perfectly True, Primordial Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Mystic Wisdom and Far-Reaching Illumination.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Virtue Transforming Distant Lands.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Floating Purple Radiance.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Vehicle’s Empty Wisdom.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Practices Perfectly Fulfilled.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Cavern’s Profound Stillness.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Awakens to the Myriad Dharmas.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jeweled Canopy.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Severs Delusion and Confusion.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Mystic Illumination Without Limit.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Leads the Host of Spirits.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Harmonizes Spirits and Beings.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dharma Cloud’s Flowing Moisture.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Dwells in True Seclusion.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Upright and Wondrous Aspiration.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Wondrous Blessings.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Realizes the Source of the Dao.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Extends the Light of Images.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Embodies the Dao’s Nurturance.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Illumination.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Exhorts the Dharma Without Obstruction.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Aids the Affinity of the Dharma.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Perfect True Appearance.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Tenuity’s Radiance.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Blessings and Responds to Authority.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Capital’s Descending Grace.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Profound Stillness and Mystic Obscurity.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Practice Perfected in the Empty Realm.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Expedient Means in the Beginning.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Wondrous and Mystic Divine.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Responds to Affinities and Constantly Aids.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Guides the World in Non-Action.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Turns the Wheel of Myriad Dharmas.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Perfect Radiant Virtue.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Increase and Benefit.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Harmonious Purity and Joy.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Mystic Obscurity and Non-Action.",

When a person dies, the Earth Bureau reports to the Heavenly Emperor-Kings of the Upper Realms and the Three Primordials and Four Offices, who determine the register of sins and assign their corresponding severity.\"\n\nAgain, he bowed his head and respectfully inquired: \"Do all the dead pass through hell?\"\nThe Most High answered: \"Those who have accumulated good deeds and possess merit have their names already recorded in the registers of heaven, and their forms are transformed to receive blessed rebirth. How could they pass through hell again? Only those who have accumulated evil, after their lives end, must face retribution. Some enter the Fengdu or Mount Tai’s twenty-six hells; some enter the Nine Dark or Eighteen Hells; some enter the Eastern Wind and Thunder Hell; some enter the Southern Fire and Obstruction Hell; some enter the Western Metal Blade Hell; some enter the Northern Cold Ice Hell; some enter the Northeastern Whipping and Beating Hell; some enter the Southeastern Scorching Hell; some enter the Southwestern Hot Iron Bed Hell; some enter the Northwestern Cauldron Boiling Hell; some enter the Central Axe and Halberd Hell; some enter the Lower Dung and Filth Hell; some enter the Heaven-Watching Hell; some enter the Level Heaven Hell; some enter the Spontaneous Hell; some enter the Nine Level Hells; some enter the Azure Edict Hell; some enter the Dark Heaven Hell; some enter the Nine Orthodox Hells; some enter the Dark Sands Hell; some enter the August Heaven Hell; some enter the Prohibition and Punishment Hell; some enter the Northern Dark Hell; some enter the Statutes and Decrees Hell; some enter the Avīci Hell; some enter the Female Azure Hell; some enter the Heavenly Unity Hell; some enter the Supreme Dark and Mysterious Hell; some enter the Five Marchmounts’ Hells; some enter the Four Seas and Nine Rivers’ Prisons.\n\nIn such hells as these, the dark prisons are bitterly confining, the long nights are freezing, fierce flames and flying winds, swift thunder and startling quakes, sharp blades and sword-spears, iron rods and metal hammers, copper pillars and iron beds—embracing or lying upon them, poisonous birds and ferocious beasts with frost fangs and snow teeth, mutually inflicting torture. Even unto the myriad streams of the Ash River, the thousand-fathom poisonous waves, soaking within them, the pain is boundless. Fierce wardens drive them on, punishing divine soldiers, hundreds of millions in number, subjecting them to every kind of torture. In a single day, they die ten thousand deaths and are reborn ten thousand times. At such a time, how could regret avail? After enduring for a kalpa, their sins exhausted, they are reborn. Some become donkeys, oxen, mules, or horses, ridden by humans; some become feathered, scaled, or shelled creatures, slaughtered by humans. After enduring this retribution, they may regain human form, yet remain foolish, ugly, and incomplete in spirit. Dwelling only in lowly conditions, with limbs maimed, eyes blind, ears deaf, mute, or afflicted with madness, illness, hunger, cold, and starvation, lacking clothing and food, subjected to punishments and laws, they constantly dwell in suffering, barely distinct from beasts, never at peace. All this arises from past karma—how could they escape it? Without repentance, how could they be freed?\n\nTherefore, with single-minded devotion, prostrate and earnest, they dedicate this to their masters, parents, ancestors, and kin, and further to so-and-so, extending to all sentient beings, repenting of hellish sins and paying homage to the Great Compassionate Supreme Worthy.\n\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Beginning, the Great Sage and Perfectly True.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Unity.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Abides in the Primordial Form.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Divine Activity.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Universally Protects the Multitudes of Spirits.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Terrace and Diligent Virtue.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Lofty Stability and Wisdom.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Silent Recollection and Non-Action.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Hidden Radiance in Victorious Splendor.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Roams in Stillness.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Concentrates Spirit in the Purple Palace.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Clarity and True Purity.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Subtle Vision of the Purple Ultimate.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Void and Constant Stillness.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Profound Obscurity and Divine Transformation.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Peace and Bliss.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Most Victorious Heavenly Worthy.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Upright Serenity and Harmonious Radiance.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Vast Flowering Virtue.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Pure Perfection.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Harmonious Radiance and Hidden Wonders.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Transcends the Dark Boundary.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from the Eight Difficulties.\nWith devoted faith, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy Who Rides the Light and Floats in the Void.",
