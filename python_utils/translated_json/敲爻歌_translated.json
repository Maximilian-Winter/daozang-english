  "full_translation": "**\"The Knocking Yarrow Song\" by Lü Dongbin**\n\nA lotus-wandering guest at Han’s end and Tang’s realm,\nThus the knocking of yarrow remains unfathomable.\nUnbound by transverse or inverse, no barriers stand—\nStillness is non-action, movement is form.\n\nDrinking wine, eating meat,\nYet holding fast to mist and flowers, cutting off lust.\nSinging songs and chanting verses of rouge and powder,\nUpholding precepts while wine and meat fill the belly.\n\nForm is medicine, wine is emolument,\nWithin wine and sensuality, no restraints bind.\nOnly through flowers and wine is long life misled,\nDrinking wine with flowers makes gods and ghosts weep.\n\nBreak no precepts, commit no lewdness,\nFor breaking precepts drowns true nature.\nLewdness corrupts the treasure of long life—\nOnly those with Dao-power may attain it.\n\nMen of Dao-power, true free spirits,\nWine is their good friend, flowers their companion.\nSeeking the true man in the willow lanes,\nThe true man is found only in the flower streets’ play.\n\nPlucking blossoms, wearing them while drinking the wine of immortality,\nIn this scene, non-action makes the Dao flourish.\nLet the deluded masses mock and jeer—\nImmortal flowers and wine are the immortal realm.\n\nIn this realm, no ordinary guest,\nThe maiden and infant birth joy.\nWithin the grotto, four-season flowers ever bloom,\nEach blossom knits the elixir of long life.\n\nThe elixir of long life, plucked from the flower’s heart,\nLayer upon layer of petals, radiant spring’s splendor.\nOrdinary folk know not the flower’s principle—\nA single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.\n\nThank heaven and earth, revere the void,\nTo retreat as an immortal youth is to follow the ancestors.\nBend the ear to hear the primordial, wondrous essence,\nAscend Penglai’s first peak.\n\nThe first peak, a sacred thing,\nWhere only golden sprouts grow in the indistinct.\nMouth to mouth, the transmission leaves no written trace—\nOnly those with firm spiritual roots and marrow may receive it.\n\nFirm marrow, refined roots,\nPetal upon petal of peach blossoms in the grotto’s spring.\nSevens of the White Tiger nurtured in pairs,\nEights of the Green Dragon, all weighing one catty.\n\nTrue father and mother, escorting the primordial palace,\nWood Mother and Metal Lord, their natures inherently gentle.\nWithin the twelve palaces, the toad’s essence appears,\nEver the earthly soul descends, the celestial spirit.\n\nLead is wrought, mercury first born,\nJade crucible and golden tripod, yet uncooked.\nOne husband, one wife, mirroring heaven and earth,\nOne man, one woman, uniting Qian and Kun.\n\nGeng must be born, Jia must be born,\nWhen Jia and Geng are born, the Dao begins to sprout.\nPlucking the root of heaven and the marrow of earth,\nWhite snow and yellow sprouts grow of themselves.\n\nLead too is born, mercury too is born,\nBorn to be eternally cooked as one.\nThis refining is not of fluids or humors,\nBut the essence of heaven and earth, sun and moon.\n\nThe Yellow Dame matches them to perfect union,\nTransmitted mouth to mouth without a moment’s delay.\nThe Eight Trigrams and Three Primes rely wholly on mercury,\nThe Five Phases and Four Images—how could they leave lead?\n\nLead begets mercury, mercury begets lead,\nSeizing the mechanism of Qian and Kun’s creation.\nIn the profound and obscure, the indistinct arises,\nFrom the indistinct and vague, a mass coalesces.\n\nNature must be empty, intent must be single,\nLest the monkey-mind leap and grasp at random.\nWhen the flower’s dew first opens, touch it not—\nLock it in the earthen cauldron, withdraw not the bolt.\n\nWithin the jade crucible, refined with gentle fire,\nThrough the twelve hours, guard the One.\nAt this time, the Yellow Path unites yin and yang,\nThe Three Natures and primordial palaces leak nothing.\n\nWhen qi moves, true fire burns,\nLet not the primordial pearl leave the sacred hall.\nAdjust the fire’s timing, beware of danger—\nThe first nine, the hidden dragon, must not be refined.\n\nThe fire’s message shifts, the knife’s edge transforms,\nThe yellow sprouts of the great earth grow everywhere.\nWithin the reckoning of the Five Phases, one yang is born,\nThe twenty-four qi arrayed like strung pearls.\n\nWhen the fire’s count is complete, the medicine ripens,\nThen come the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl.\nThree leads yield but one lead’s completion,\nThe golden fruit and immortal sprout have yet to manifest.\n\nReinstall the furnace, reestablish the tripod,\nRiding the tiger, mounting the dragon, leaving the mortal realm.\nThe sun’s essence just appears, the moon’s radiance congeals,\nThe two eights unite in Ren and Bing.\n\nDragon-mercury binds, tiger-lead forms,\nPenglai is but a short journey away.\nKun-lead and Qian-mercury are the ancestors of the golden elixir,\nDragon-lead and tiger-mercury are most efficacious.\n\nGrasp this principle, and the Dao is complete,\nThe thirty thousand divine farmers guard the crystal.\nGuard the time, fix the day, clarify the talisman’s moment,\nDevote the heart solely to reverent intent.\n\nWhen black lead passes, gather the pure and true,\nA single clash settles great peace.\nThe three carts transport treasures of pearl,\nDelivered to the sacred treasury, naturally efficacious.\n\nHeavenly spirits protect, earthly deities welcome,\nMerging the essences of Qian, Kun, sun, and moon.\nThe tiger’s roar—once—and the dragon emerges from its den,\nPhoenixes dance as the luan-birds fly from the golden city.\n\nCinnabar matched, mercury stilled,\nA band of rosy clouds arrays before the Great Clarity.\nFrom the lead pool, golden light emerges,\nMercury’s fiery pearls flow into the imperial capital.\n\nDragon and tiger mate, externally holding fullness,\nThe saint walks, the spirit flies within the sacred vessel.\nIn one hour, the golden elixir is complete,\nAscending to the golden gates as purple clouds arise.\n\nThe immortal peach ripens, pluck and consume it,\nMyriad transformations come to pay homage, heaven and earth rejoice.\nObserve fasting, await the birth of one yang,\nThen advance the Zhou Heaven, fathoming its principle.\n\nFathom its principle, refine the golden elixir,\nWater and fire steam through a hundred barriers.\nNurturing the embryo for ten months, the divine elixir forms—\nHow could a man’s pregnancy be ordinary?\n\nThe inner elixir complete, the outer elixir achieved,\nInner and outer join in harmonious union.\nFormed into a single mass of purple-golden light,\nTransforming and soaring through heaven and earth for ages.\n\nThe elixir enters the belly—no common thing—\nThe yin form is stripped away, pure yang remains.\nAscending, feather-transformed, a guest of the Three Clarities,\nName fulfilled, merit complete, reaching the highest heavens.\n\nGuests of the Three Clarities, riding jade chariots,\nMounting cranes, soaring through the empyrean into the Great Void.\nSuch carefree joy and delight,\nRoaming the three realms, most pure and wondrous.\n\nAbove the Great Void, the perfected cultivator,\nBright and round, nothing remains.\nNothing remains—only the Dao is manifest,\nFrom the five directions, the true man’s visage emerges.\n\nImmortal boys and girls welcome with colored clouds,\nWithin the Palace of Five Lights, the true decree is transmitted.\nTransmitting the true decree, transforming hidden feelings,\nThe listeners and those awakened to conditions melt like ice,\nOuter paths and asuras shrink back in terror.\n\nTouching dry bones, they stand and take form,\nTrusting the heavenly ladder is ever level.\nNine generations of ancestral spirits attain liberation—\nWho would envy the splendor of wealth and honor?\n\nSeek the resolute, seek the worthy,\nTogether set the crucible to refine the mortal frame.\nIf one hoards talent and begrudges treasure,\nTen thousand immortals will refuse to come.\n\nThe true cultivator speaks no falsehood,\nFor each reckless word incurs a great debt.\nThrough ten thousand kalpas in sinking sands, the Dao remains unachieved,\nFrom all seven apertures, the eyes burst blood.\n\nThe destitute yet steadfast vow earnestly,\nTo gather all worldly passions and lift them away.\nJoined in the immortal assembly of Penglai,\nThe torments of the mundane world are wholly stilled.\n\nThe mortal realm is brief—ponder it well,\nFor within the grotto-heavens, sun and moon stretch long.\nWith firm resolve and苦心 for two or three years,\nAcross a hundred thousand kalpas, life knows no end.\n\nAttain the sagely Dao, perceive the true constant,\nTiger’s maw and blade’s edge bring no harm.\nWater, fire, mosquitoes, dragons cause no injury,\nClapping hands, one laughs in the heavenly palace.\n\nThese merits, truly wondrous,\nYet who among men would claim them?\nFoolish disciples cling to form, lust, and wealth,\nThus immortals refuse to summon them.\n\nThe true and perfect Dao makes no distinction,\nAsking neither high nor low, rich nor poor.\nEven princes and nobles must first cast off splendor,\nTempering their sharp edges.\n\nIf wrath remains unremoved, folly unchanged,\nOne plunges into the sea of samsara’s birth and death.\nHeaps of gold and jade fill mountains and rivers,\nYet immortals but smile and pay no heed.\n\nFame is not noble, the Dao most supreme,\nSage after sage, worthy after worthy, manifest in descendants.\nGirded with jade, astride a proud steed,\nA fleeting glimpse—like dust in a crack.\n\nDust in a crack, fire in stone,\nWhy vainly fix the heart on lasting schemes?\nThrough bitter torment, none can be called back,\nSeizing profit, contending for fame, like a seething cauldron.\n\nLike a seething cauldron, mercury sinks and drowns,\nLosing the Dao, deluded by truth, karma’s root.\nOne who levels the thorns in the heart’s field,\nShall receive the celestial mechanism revealed.\n\nLife must be transmitted, nature must be awakened,\nTo enter sagehood, transcend the ordinary—this rests with you.\nFew tread the path of the Three Clarities,\nWhile many vie to enter the gates of the Six Realms.\n\nRepay the worthy, cast aside longing,\nGuard well the mechanism of life and nature.\nIf even one lacks fragrance,\nClinging to waves and dregs, one strays from the path.\n\nTo cultivate nature alone, neglecting life,\nThis is the foremost malady of practice.\nTo refine only the ancestral nature, not the elixir,\nThrough ten thousand kalpas, the yin spirit struggles to attain sagehood.\n\nGrasping the life-school, deluded by nature’s root,\nLike gazing at a reflection without a precious mirror.\nA fool whose life spans heaven and earth,\nHolding family wealth yet lacking the master’s handle.\n\nTo cultivate both life and nature, origin upon origin,\nRide the Dharma-wave at the ocean’s bottom in the Dharma-boat.\nCapture alive the dragon’s head,\nThen know the master craftsman’s skill was not in vain.",
