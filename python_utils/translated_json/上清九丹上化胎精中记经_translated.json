  "full_translation": "**The Upper Clarity Scripture on the Nine Elixirs and the Transformation of Embryonic Essence: Central Record**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Upper Clarity Scripture on the Nine Elixirs and the Transformation of Embryonic Essence: Central Record* (abbreviated as *Central Record of Embryonic Essence*).\n\nAuthor unknown, approximately dated to the Eastern Jin dynasty. A foundational scripture of the early Shangqing (Upper Clarity) tradition. One fascicle.\n\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n**The Upper Clarity Scripture on the Nine Elixirs and the Transformation of Embryonic Essence: Central Record** (alternate title: *Nine Heavens’ Jade Embryo and Numinous Radiance*)\n\n**Table of Contents #1**\n- Talisman of the Nine Elixirs’ Yang Spirit for Upper Transformation\n- Talisman of Embryonic Essence for Refining the Spirit\n- Talisman of the Three Passes and Twelve Knots within the Embryonic Sac\n- Talisman of the Nine Elixirs’ Flowing Essence for Preserving Life\n\nThe text of the *Nine Elixirs’ Upper Transformation* was bestowed by the Lord Emperor of the Grand Tenuity upon the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens. It enables the ninefold cyclical refinement of essence, the return of spirit, the dissolution of the purple embryonic knots, and the nourishment of the primordial orifices with flowing essence. Internally, it fills the marrow; externally, it overflows through the nine apertures, brightening them. The bones are refined, and each joint receives the true. Its method is lofty and wondrous, concealed within the Golden Chamber and Jade Abode of the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Capital. According to the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, it is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas. Only those whose names are inscribed in the Purple Registers of the Upper Clarity in green script may partake of its teachings. Whoever violates its sacred prohibitions shall be smitten by divine soldiers. Those who cultivate it in secret and attain the Dao shall ascend as immortals in broad daylight.\n\nThe Venerable Person of the Nine Heavens addressed the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens: \"When heaven and earth exchange their revolutions, the two images merge into the true. Yin and yang descend their qi, corresponding above to the Nine Mysteries. The flowing elixir undergoes nine transformations, congealing qi into essence. Essence transforms into spirit, and spirit metamorphoses into humanity. Thus, humans mirror heaven and earth, and their qi follows the natural. The qi of the natural is the essence of the Nine Heavens, which, when transformed into the human body, is contained, nurtured, and nourished within the embryo. After nine months, the qi is full; the qi of the Nine Heavens is pervasive. In the tenth month, birth occurs. The formation of the embryo and its transformation may be auspicious or inauspicious, long-lived or short-lived, for these depend on the purity of the karmic roots and the congealed qi. If the viscera accumulate stagnation and the six palaces suffer damage, the form and spirit will not be firm, and the body will not receive the numinous. When the qi of death enters the orifices, how can one endure? Many engage in cultivation and study yet remain ignorant of this origin. Now, I reveal it to you: the true of a single form, when born, dissolves its knots, nourishes the hundred spirits, and the body naturally radiates light. The inner palaces become luminous, the spirit rests in its abode, and the myriad qi ascend as immortals. Guard this secret; do not lightly disclose it.\n\nAll who receive life form the nine elixirs’ upper transformation within the embryonic sac, following the qi of the Nine Heavens. When the qi is full and the spirit complete, they recognize within the embryonic membrane their past lives, know their original roots, and comprehend the karmic cycles of the Nine Heavens’ kalpas that shaped their bodies. Yet upon beholding the yang path and the vastness of the Three Luminaries, they forget the causes of their birth and origin. This arises from the stagnation of the embryonic roots, the blockage of the Three Passes, the disorder of the five palaces, and the obstruction of the gates by the qi of death, preventing the numinous passes from opening and causing the forgetting of karmic causes. If a numinous perfected one entrusts transformation, refining the jade embryo and briefly passing through the purple portal, treading the human path, they emerge naturally radiant, beholding the numinous with luminous splendor. They then ascend bodily to the Nine Heavens, no longer bound to the cycle of congealing essence and receiving qi to become human.\n\nThose who cultivate and study, aspiring to immortality, must refine the body with the nine elixirs, dissolve the knots of the five spirits, guide qi to its original birth, and extinguish the roots at the Three Gates. After nine refinements and ten transformations, the hundred joints become luminous. Once the embryonic knots are severed and the original true is known, one becomes an immortal of the highest rank. Without this method, the Three Palaces remain dull, the qi of death is not extinguished, the stomach does not receive the numinous, qi departs and spirit wanders, the Red Child is not joyful, the palaces lie abandoned, and demonic influences enter the body. Thus, the hundred ailments arise, life is not fulfilled, and the pain is beyond words.\n\nYang qi is red and is called the Mysterious Elixir. Yin qi is yellow and is called Yellow Essence. When yin and yang intersect and the two qi descend, essence transforms and spirit congeals, corresponding above to the Nine Heavens. The qi of the Nine Heavens then descends to fill the cinnabar field, merging with essence to congeal and unite at the Gate of Life. After nine cycles, this becomes the Nine Elixirs. Through upper transformation and lower congealment, a human is formed. In the first month, qi is received; in the second, the numinous; in the third, transformation is contained; in the fourth, essence congeals; in the fifth, the body and head take shape; in the sixth, the form is transformed; in the seventh, the spirit’s positions are arrayed; in the eighth, the nine orifices become bright; in the ninth, the qi of the Nine Heavens pervades, and sound emerges; in the tenth, the Director of Destinies inscribes the register, and life is received at birth. Thus, humans receive the qi of the Nine Heavens and the essence of yin and yang, called the Nine Elixirs, which together form the human body. Once born as human, one should return to the original true, regulate the five viscera, dissolve the embryonic roots, and sever the gates of death to naturally become an immortal.\n\nAll who are born within the embryonic sac receive the qi of the Nine Heavens, congealing essence to form the human body. Yet within the embryo, there are twelve knots that coil around the five viscera, causing stagnation and blockage, knots that cannot be dissolved, and nodes that cannot be extinguished. Thus, human illness arises from the stagnation of nodes, and the end of life comes from the fixation of knots. If one can dissolve the twelve embryonic knots, even the desire for death will be unattainable.\n\nThe upper part of the embryo has four knots: the first knot lies within the Muddy Pellet (brain), the second in the mouth, the third in the cheeks, and the fourth in the eyes. To dissolve the four upper knots, on the day of one’s original destiny at dawn, enter a chamber, burn incense, and bow nine times toward the northwest, facing the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens. Strike the teeth nine times, and thrice invoke the taboo name of the Primordial Father, *Zunhui*. Then bow three times toward the southeast, thrice invoking the taboo name of the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Heavens, *Dunhuan*. Sit upright according to your original destiny, close your eyes, and visualize the Primordial Father: his body is nine inches and nine fen tall, clad in a sash of dark yellow and plain numinous silk. He wears a crown of accumulated nine-tiered pearls and jade, the *Wujijinxian* cap, and resides in the Jade Capital of the Supreme Ultimate within the Nine Heavens, the Treasure Palace of the Cinnabar Numinous Realm in the Cavern of Primordial Purity. He rides a flying chariot of azure radiance, attended by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending from the northwest to enter your body and govern the realm of the Muddy Pellet.\"\n\nNext visualize the Mysterious Mother: her body is six inches and six fen tall, clad in a sash of azure treasure, divine radiance, brocade, frost-silk, and nine-colored essence. She wears a crown of purple origin and dark yellow treasure, residing above the Nine Qi and the Ultimate Non-Ultimate, within the Sevenfold Radiance of the Jasper Grove, the Cinnabar Chamber of the Jade Treasure, the Cavern of Primordial Purity, the Ninefold Radiance Realm, and the Upper Clarity Precinct. She rides a flying canopy of purple clouds and refined feathered shade, attended by ten supreme phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, descending from the southeast to enter your body and govern the Cavern Chamber of the face.\n\nVisualize the Father and Mother transforming into blue and yellow qi, coiling and intertwining, vying above your head and face. When complete, strike the teeth nine times and softly intone:\n\n*\"I, [your name], receive the transformation of the Nine Numinosities, yet my qi remains impure, my nodes stagnant and coiled, sealing the numinous gates. Reverently, by my original destiny, I report above to the Lofty Dawn’s Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother, and below to my own body. May the Eight Radiant Scenes shine as one, the Nine Heavens unite in truth, jointly dissolving the four upper knots of the womb-root. May the numinous turn back to guard the gates, the nine apertures knit into immortality, the inner embryo refined and transformed, the Nine Elixirs congeal the spirit, blue transmuted into red, the two qi entwined. May my life span equal the Three Luminaries, and my years endure for countless eons.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow qi eighty-one times and cease.\n\nThen visualize the King of *Yudan* Immeasurable Heaven, surnamed *Hun*, taboo name *Shuangnianchu*, clad in a nine-colored, seamless, naturally patterned robe, wearing a crown of radiant essence and solar roundness. He governs within the Boundless Dark Terrace and Purple Gate of Heaven, riding a nine-mountain jade wheel, attended by twenty-four jade immortals.\n\nNext visualize the King of *Shangshang Chanshan* Immeasurable Longevity Heaven, surnamed *Xi*, taboo name *Yanniannan*, clad in a nine-colored cloud-patterned robe, wearing a crown of luminous essence and lunar radiance. He governs the Kingdom of Heavenly Kings, the Seven Treasures of the Vermilion Grove, and the Jasper Terrace, riding a twelvefold dark turtle and flying azure feathered canopy, attended by thirty-two jade lads of the Upper Palace.\n\nNext visualize the King of *Xuyan* Heaven, surnamed *Zi*, taboo name *Niannaichu*, clad in a nine-colored robe of the Three Dharma Clouds, wearing a crown of Heavenly Origin and Jade Treasure. He governs the Jade Capital and Numinous Metropolis Palace of Heaven, riding a nine-colored flying swan and threefold plain flying clouds, attended by twenty-four jade maidens of pure numinosity.\n\nVisualize the Three Heavenly True Kings descending above your head and face, transforming into blue, purple, and yellow qi, chaotic as intertwining clouds. They enter through the mouth, ears, and nostrils, encircling your entire face. Then look up and intone:\n\n*\"Great Kings of the Three Heavens, Ninefold Mysterious Numinous Immortals, dissolve for me the knots and barriers of my head and face. Transform the Nine Elixirs naturally, descending upon the Golden Gate of Essence. Intermingle the clouds of the Three Perfected, flowing into my body to perfect my spirit. Scour away the qi of death, extinguish the womb-root, secure the numinous radiance, and cast off all baleful afflictions. May each knot be untied, each node receive the true, the dark radiance flow and spread, deeply irrigating the hidden springs. Proclaim my name to the Nine Heavens, return the embryo to immortality, inwardly replete and outwardly full, within and without become spirit.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow qi nine times and cease.\n\nNext visualize the Eight Radiant Lads of the Upper Realm.\n\nWith eyes closed, visualize the brain spirit, named *Awareness Primordial Lad*, styled *Dao Capital*, one inch and one fen tall, clad in white brocade, wearing a three-ridge treasure crown.\n\nThe hair spirit, named *Mysterious Father Hua*, styled *Dao Balance*, two inches and one fen tall, clad in dark cloud brocade, wearing a *Wujijinxian* cap.\n\nThe skin spirit, named *Permeating Multitude Second*, styled *Dao Link*, one inch and five fen tall, clad in a yellow brocade flying skirt, wearing a Three Qi Treasure Heaven Crown.\n\nThe eye spirit, named *Void Supervisor Born*, styled *Dao Lad*, three inches tall, clad in five-colored patterned robes, wearing a *Tongtian* crown.\n\nThe neck marrow spirit, named *Numinous Plan Cover*, styled *Dao Circumference*, five inches tall, clad in a white brocade plain skirt, wearing a three-ridge treasure crown.\n\nThe spine spirit, named *Benefit Calendar Auxiliary*, styled *Dao Pillar*, three inches and five fen tall, clad in soft white jade robes, wearing a *Xuanyuan* treasure crown.\n\nThe nose spirit, named *Surging Dragon Jade*, styled *Dao Subtle*, two inches and five fen tall, clad in azure-yellow plain brocade flying skirt, wearing a *Yuanyou* crown.\n\nThe tongue spirit, named *Beginning Ridge Peak*, styled *Dao Fork*, seven inches tall, clad in crimson brocade flying skirt, wearing a *Jinxian* cap.\n\nWhen the Eight Radiant Scenes are complete, all resemble infants, gathered upon the face, each settled in its place. Then strike the teeth eight times and softly intone:\n\n*\"Upper Radiance, one realm, eight spirits unite the true. The qi of the Nine Elixirs transforms and perfects my body. A thousand chariots, ten thousand riders, like clouds dispersing and mist scattering, descend to encircle my head and face, bestowing numinosity and arraying spirit. Above, dissolve the knots and nodes; within, extinguish the womb-root; below, remove the fixed stagnations. Unblock and regulate the Three Passes. The Eight Radiant Scenes guard and protect, sharing the same age as the numinous. The Imperial Lord and Mysterious Mother, turning back to the Lofty Dawn, descend their jade splendor, halting my withered freshness. Return my countenance to crimson, my face to golden immortality. Transform the radiance to pursue lightning, directly entering the Gate of the Sun.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow qi eight times, then cease, and ingest the talisman of the Upper Transmutation’s Nine Elixirs and Yang Numinosity.\n\n**Talisman of the Upper Transmutation’s Nine Elixirs and Yang Numinosity**\nInscribed in cinnabar on blue paper, three copies.\n\nAt high noon, face your original destiny, strike the teeth nine times, and softly intone:\n\n*\"Upper Transmutation of the Nine Qi, refining and transforming the hundred spirits. Within, govern the Six Palaces; without, descend the Great Immortals. The Mysterious Mother crafts the essences, dissolving knots and dispersing stagnations, severing and extinguishing the womb-root. The body becomes light, the flesh flies, responding to qi naturally, ascending with qi to stand before the Emperor.\"*\n\nWhen finished, ingest the talisman, swallow nine times, and cease.\n\nThe knots of the upper realm reside within the precincts of the head and face. On the day of your original destiny, at dawn enter the chamber, silently visualize the true numinous, dissolve the knots and disperse the nodes, sever and extinguish the womb-root. Ingest fluids, swallow qi, and employ the talisman of Yang Numinosity to unblock and regulate the Three Palaces. After three years of this practice, the body will rest and qi strengthen, bones lighten and flesh firm, riding the void to fly, entering and exiting without obstruction.\n\nAfter nine years, one attains communion with the numinous, conversing with spirits as equals, descending in cloud chariots, ascending into the Emperor’s dawn. This secret transformative Dao must be guarded against disclosure to the uninitiated—its precepts and prohibitions are weighty, and transgression brings calamity upon the Seven Mysteries. Only through clandestine cultivation can one achieve the rank of Supreme Immortal.\n\nWithin the middle realm, there are four knots: the first resides among the Five Viscera, the second within the Great Granary, the third within the Large Intestine, and the fourth within the Small Intestine. To dissolve these four knots of the middle realm, on the day of your original destiny at the hour of high noon, enter the chamber, burn incense, and bow nine times toward the northwest, facing the Primordial Father. Thrice invoke the Primordial Father’s taboo name, *Zunhui*; then turn to the southeast and bow three times, facing the Mysterious Mother. Thrice invoke the Mysterious Mother’s taboo name, *Dunhuan*. Sit upright upon your current year’s position, knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, and visualize the Primordial Father: his form stands nine inches and nine fen tall, clad in a sash of dark yellow and plain numinous silk, his head crowned with a seven-tiered pearl-and-jade cap, the *Wuji Jinxian* coronet, dwelling in the Jade Capital of the Supreme Ultimate within the Nine Heavens, the Vermilion Numinous Precinct of the Cavernous Origin within the Treasure Palace of the Cinnabar Spirit Realm. He rides a flying chariot of azure radiance, accompanied by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending from the northwest to enter the Five Viscera within your body.\n\nNext, visualize the Mysterious Mother: her form stands six inches and six fen tall, clad in a nine-colored sash of luminous brocade, frost-silk, and divine light, her head crowned with the *Ziyuan Xuanhuang* treasure coronet. She dwells in the Sevenfold Radiance Vermilion Chamber of the Nine Qi’s Primordial Ultimate, the Treasure Palace of the Cavernous Origin within the Nine Radiance Precinct of the Upper Clarity Realm. She rides a feathered canopy of flying essence upon purple clouds, accompanied by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, descending from the southeast to enter your Five Viscera.\n\nVisualize the father and mother transforming into blue and yellow qi, merging into a chaos as round as the sun, illuminating the Five Viscera, their radiance shining within and without. Then raise your head and intone:\n\n*\"Spirit of the Father, essence of the Mother,\nThe two qi unite as one,\nNine elixirs congeal and transform,\nNurturing the purple jade of the womb.\nReceiving the radiance of the Grand Tenuity,\nDestiny linked to the Nine Numinous,\nThe Emperor unfolds the divine,\nFlowing truth to irrigate life.\nThe knots of the Five Viscera unbind,\nThe Six Palaces become limpid and clear.\nThe stomach’s tube opens to wisdom,\nThe nine orifices grow bright and lucid.\nOld nodes disperse and vanish,\nA new embryo flourishes anew.\nTransforming the body through radiant refinement,\nAdorned with the nine stars’ regalia,\nThe Three Luminaries flank my retinue,\nFlying into the Emperor’s court.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow forty-five breaths and cease.\n\nNext, visualize the Heavenly King of Serene Stillness: surnamed *Jin*, taboo name *Yuyu*, clad in a seven-colored dragon-patterned robe of penetrating light, his head crowned with the *Yin Essence Moonlight* diadem. He governs from the Vermilion Palace’s Jade Terrace in the heavens, riding an eight-scene flying wheel, accompanied by twelve jade immortals.\n\nThen visualize the Heavenly King of Unyielding Joy: surnamed *Ning*, taboo name *Yuyu*, clad in a nine-colored robe of flying frost and cloud-patterned brocade, his head crowned with the *Azure Florescence Year-Star Mystic Essence* coronet. He governs from the nine-tiered Jade Terrace of the Vermilion Chamber in the Heavenly Origin Palace, riding a chariot of white deer and cinnabar radiance, accompanied by twenty-six jade immortals of the Upper Palace.\n\nNext, visualize the Heavenly King of Responsive Transformation: surnamed *Yao*, taboo name *Yuzan*, clad in a nine-colored robe of flowing luminous cloud-brocade, his head crowned with the *White Radiance Grand White Jade Essence* coronet. He governs from the Vermilion Chamber of the Upper Palace in the Heavenly Jade Grove, riding a flying phoenix and soaring auroral purple wheel, accompanied by thirty-six jade immortals of the Grand Perfected.\n\nFinally, visualize the Three Heavenly Perfected Kings descending together into the Five Viscera within your body, transforming into red, white, and black qi, merging into a chaos like cloudy mist. They enter through the aperture of the heart, suffusing the Five Viscera entirely. Then softly intone:\n\n*\"Nine elixirs congeal in the auroral void,\nThree qi intertwine and bind.\nProfound truth fills and descends,\nWithin and without, bright and clear.\nThe Great Granary opens and closes,\nIntestines and stomach knot into immortals.\nSever and extinguish the stem of nodes,\nDispel and dissolve the roots of old.\nThree harmonies form a covenant,\nNine transformations congeal the spirit.\nReturning essence to the jade womb,\nTo perfect this body of mine.\nNine-colored dark yellow,\nFlowing essence to irrigate fluids.\nScouring and washing away stagnations,\nWithin, no dregs or dust remain.\nFlourishing branches unite in splendor,\nPlanting and nurturing the numinous root.\nEach aperture grows limpid and bright,\nEach node becomes cool and serene.\nBones transform into radiant flight,\nAscending into the Purple Heavens.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow nine breaths upward and cease.\n\nNext, visualize the Eight Radiant Divine Lads of the Middle Realm. Close the eyes and summon the spirit of the throat: named *Hundred Streams Flow*, styled *Dao Tong*, his form eight inches tall, clad in nine-colored patterned robes, his head crowned with the *Level Heaven Purple Dawn* coronet. The spirit of the lungs: named *Plain Numinous Life*, styled *Dao Ping*, his form eight inches and one fen tall, clad in white brocade and flying cloud robes, his head crowned with the *Nine Origins Treasure Coronet*. The spirit of the heart: named *Brilliant Yang Prosperity*, styled *Dao Ming*, his form nine inches tall, clad in crimson patterned robes, his head crowned with the *Jade Dawn Treasure Heaven Coronet*. The spirit of the liver: named *Opening Lord Lad*, styled *Dao Qing*, his form seven inches tall, clad in flying azure feather skirts, his head crowned with the *Three-Ridge Coronet*. The spirit of the gallbladder: named *Dragon Virtue Constraint*, styled *Dao Fang*, his form three inches and six fen tall, clad in azure, yellow, and green skirts, his head crowned with the *Wuji Jinxian Coronet*. The spirit of the left kidney: named *Spring Origin Perfected*, styled *Dao Qing*, his form three inches and seven fen tall, clad in five-colored transforming light skirts, his head crowned with the *Wandering Coronet*. The spirit of the right kidney: named *Image Other None*, styled *Dao Sheng*, his form three inches and five fen tall, clad in white brocade robes, his head crowned with the *Three Qi Treasure Radiance Coronet*. The spirit of the spleen: named *Treasure Origin Complete*, styled *Dao Qian*, his form seven inches and three fen tall, clad in yellow brocade flying skirts, his head crowned with the *Purple Dawn Coronet*.\n\nWhen the visualization of the Eight Radiant Lads is complete, they all appear in the form of infants, uniting within the Five Viscera, each settling into its proper place. Then knock the teeth eight times and raise your head to intone:\n\n*\"Eight Radiant Lads of the Middle Realm,\nTransforming ninefold above,\nRefining essence into the jade womb,\nKnots of qi in the Purple Tenuity.\nRefining the hun and solidifying the po,\nAll spirits gather and return.\nThe Emperor unbinds the knots,\nNine orifices scatter and open.\nThe Mysterious Mother descends with numinosity,\nEach node receives its radiance.\nWithin, replete; without, overflowing,\nFlourishing light never wanes.\nAttaining union with the Eight Radiant,\nRiding the same chariot to fly,\nThe mandate of my original destiny begins,\nAs I have visualized and returned.\nCarry me upward in ascent,\nParting the gates of the numinous to behold.\"*\n\nUpon completion, raise your head and swallow eight breaths to conclude, then ingest the talisman of \"Embryonic Essence and Refined Spirit.\" The talisman of *Embryonic Essence and Refined Spirit* is inscribed in yellow on white paper, three copies in total.\n\nAt high noon, face the direction of your current year’s station, knock the teeth nine times, and softly intone:\n*\"Mysterious qi congeals essence,\nYin transforms and Yang arises,\nNine revolutions, Eight Radiant attained,\nRiding the flowing chariot,\nDescending into my body,\nCommuning with spirits and anchoring numinosity,\nUnbinding knots and scattering tangles,\nFour fetters dissolved and purified,\nNine orifices open wide,\nMyriad qi universally tranquil,\nRiding the void and soaring in radiance,\nAscending into the Grand Clarity.\"*\n\nUpon completion, ingest the talisman and swallow saliva nine times to conclude.\n\nThe four knots of the Middle Realm reside within the Five Viscera. On the day of your original destiny, at dawn, untie the upper knot; at high noon, untie the middle knot, severing the root of the embryonic womb. Ingest numinous fluid, wield the spirit talisman, swallow primordial qi, and commune with the spirit abode. After three years of such practice, the numinous qi will overflow; after nine years of accumulated resonance, you will share a chariot with the spirits, soaring through the Great Void and ascending into the Emperor’s abode. The sublime and wondrous method is no empty Way—those who earnestly seek immortality must deeply guard this scripture.\n\nThe Lower Realm also contains four knots: one in the bladder, one in the yin organ, one in the posterior gate, and one in both feet. To untie the four knots of the Lower Realm, on the day of your original destiny at midnight, when the qi of the new day begins, enter your chamber, burn incense, and bow nine times toward the northwest, facing the Primordial Father. Call his name thrice: *\"Zun Hui.\"* Then turn toward the southeast and bow three times, facing the Mysterious Mother. Call her name thrice: *\"Dun Huan.\"*\n\nFace the Grand Year’s station, sit upright, knock the teeth nine times, close your eyes, and visualize the Primordial Father: nine inches and nine fen in height, clad in a sash of dark yellow and plain numinous silk, wearing a cap adorned with seven strands of pearls and jade, the *Wuji Jinxian* crown. He dwells in the Jade Palace of the Great Ultimate within the Nine Heavens, the Treasure Treasury of the Vermilion Numinosity in the Cavernous Origin of the Red Mystery Village. He rides a chariot of azure radiance, accompanied by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending from the northwest into the Five Viscera and bladder within your body.\n\nNext, visualize the Mysterious Mother: six inches and six fen in height, clad in a nine-colored sash of azure treasure, divine radiance, brocade, frost-like gauze, and embroidered silk. She wears a crown of purple origin and dark yellow treasure, dwelling in the Sevenfold Radiance of the Jade Grove within the Nine Qi and Wuji, the Treasure Treasury of the Cavernous Origin in the Ninefold Radiance Village of the Upper Clarity. She rides a canopy of flying essence and purple clouds, accompanied by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, descending from the southeast into your bladder and down to both feet.\n\nVisualize your father and mother transforming into azure and yellow qi, merging into a chaos as round as the sun, illuminating your entire body inside and out. Then raise your head and intone:\n*\"Yin and Yang harmoniously unite,\nDual qi resplendently clear,\nAbove transforms into mysterious cinnabar,\nBelow revolves into yellow essence,\nEmbracing the embryo and undergoing transformation,\nThe body assumes no fixed form,\nThe Emperor oversees and illumines,\nNine orifices receive numinosity,\nTwelve knots of the departments,\nDissolved and extinguished in the Yellow Court,\nEight Radiant entwine and bind,\nThe stomach’s knot becomes purple jade,\nThree hun refined,\nSeven po tranquil,\nMyriad spirits treasured and anchored,\nWithin and without in perfect balance,\nThree Realms and Eight Radiant,\nBorn together with me,\nConvey me in flight and ascent,\nTo ascend and reach the Jade Clarity.\"*\n\nUpon completion, swallow twenty-four breaths to conclude.\n\nNext, visualize the Brahma Treasure Heavenly King, surnamed Jing, named *Wuyun Yao*, clad in a nine-colored robe of flowing clouds and flying dawn, wearing a crown of flowing cinnabar, crimson treasure, and luminous essence of the stars. He governs the Sevenfold Radiance Palace in the southern heavens, riding a chariot of flowing radiance, vermilion clouds, and jade canopies, accompanied by twelve jade immortals of the Upper Palace.\n\nThen visualize the Brahma-Makaya Heavenly King, surnamed Xuan, named *Dian Hong*, clad in a nine-colored robe of primordial phoenix and flying clouds, wearing a crown of dark dawn, morning stars, and flowing essence. He governs the Purple Jade Terrace of the Ninefold Mystery Phoenix City in the heavens, riding a flying wheel of white unicorn and plain clouds, accompanied by thirty-two jade lads of the Great Florescence.\n\nNext, visualize the Parinata Heavenly King, surnamed Yu, named *Ling Kun*, clad in a nine-colored robe of seamless dark clouds and treasure, wearing a crown of *Wuji* flowing yellow and celestial essence. He governs the Ninefold Chambers of the Jade Capital’s Great Existence Wondrous Palace in the celestial mounds, riding a five-colored cloud chariot, accompanied by twelve jade lads of the Great Mystery.\n\nVisualize the Three Heavenly True Kings descending together into your body, residing in the bladder and down to both feet, transforming into purple, green, and azure qi, merging into a mist like clouds, entering through the yin organ and flowing into the bladder, posterior gate, and both feet, illuminating inside and out.

A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders fill my yin, bladder, posterior gate, and the spaces within my two feet. Then, knock the teeth eight times and raise a prayer, saying:\n\n*\"The Eight Radiant Ones of the lower region, scattered in form and transformed in spirit, embrace the primordial and nurture qi. They refine the fetal purple mist. The Primordial Father of Grand Unity and the Mysterious Mother entwine. The two essences flow and irrigate, containing and nourishing the inner perfected ones. The Imperial Lord establishes the register; the Controller of Destiny alters the years. The knotted joints disperse; the nine apertures become fresh. The hun and po are preserved and secured.

He resides in the Cinnabar Field below the navel, governing the Three Regions and the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones.\n\nKnock the teeth thirty-two times and softly pray, saying:\n\n*\"Great spirit of the Mysterious Above, governing all without exception, settling and guarding the hidden valley, flowing essence beneath the purple canopy. The host of perfected ones attend in spirit; the Three Regions exchange protection. The Imperial Lord illumines the seat; the Mysterious Mother rejoices in offering. The Nine Origins unite in accord; the Controller of Destiny extends the journey. The Three Dawns shine together, binding with the perfected in a sash.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow the twenty-four breaths, then stop and ingest the Inner Talisman of the Three Passes and Twelve Knotted Fetal Bonds.\n\n**Inner Talisman of the Three Passes and Twelve Knotted Fetal Bonds**\nWrite in red on bamboo membrane, three slips. After completing the visualization, face the Year-Star and ingest them, softly praying:\n\n*\"The four knots of the upper region solidify the Muddy Pellet; they cast one into the flowery countenance and cut short one’s flourishing years. The four knots of the middle region gather misfortune into a flock, coiling and binding the Great Granary, hastening the wandering hun. Malevolent influences and treachery penetrate; radiant dreams are not steadfast. The four knots of the lower region bind the posterior gate, obstruct the nine apertures, and sever the root of life.\n\nThe Imperial Lord proclaims the numinous; the Five Scripts of the Nine Heavens dissolve and unbind the joints, extinguishing all roots and sources. The Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother nurture and nourish the Three Passes. The Eight Radiant Ones guard and prepare; true qi scatters and distributes. Above is clear, below is yellow; outside is square, inside is round. Exterior and interior are equally pure, descending to summon the Three Origins. Attaining the Eight Radiant Ones, one rides the clouds of dawn and soars through the void, ascending to the Golden Gate.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow twelve breaths, then swallow twenty-four times, and stop.\n\nOn one’s natal day, at the three hours of dawn, noon, and midnight, dissolve the twelve knotted joints of the Three Regions. On the eight seasonal nodes, this practice should also be performed to hasten the nearness of immortality.\n\nCultivating on the eight nodes follows the same visualization as the three hours. Practicing this for three years, one’s face will radiate jade light, the body will reflect golden perfection, flesh will diminish, bones will become light, and the inner knots will transform into an immortal. After nine years, the numinous descends, and one ascends to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThose who study without this method labor in vain. The knots remain undissolved, coiled and entangled day by day. Spirit and qi do not spread; malevolent influences enter the body. The wandering hun scatter—how can one attain immortality?\n\nSincere and devoted scholars must diligently seek this source. Dissolving the knots at the three hours, one will surely attain the highest immortality.\n\nThe *Returning Womb’s Jade Splendor* gathers the Three Passes and receives the perfected. The Three Regions and Eight Radiant Ones, the Twenty-Four Spirits, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, together ride the purple mist.\n\nThe sublime and wondrous transformation, the *Numinous Writ of the Jade Emperor*—if rashly transmitted or lightly divulged, calamity will extend to the seven ancestors. The dead souls will fill the debt, forever submerged in the river’s source. One’s own person will bear the punishment, suffering the Three Paths and Five Torments, for ten thousand kalpas without release. Scholars, be cautious and guard these words in secret.\n\nThe spirits of the Two Radiant Ones are all the transformed spiritual essences of the Nine Heavens. The Primordial Father transforms above; the Mysterious Mother forms the womb. The Nine Heavens nurture and rear, completing the human being. The Twenty-Four Persons each possess numinous passes.\n\nIf one wishes to cultivate and study yet does not know how to visualize their forms, the spirits will wander and qi will scatter. Dead qi will knot and sink; malevolent demons will enter the radiance, shortening life and cutting short the years.\n\nIf one knows how to cultivate and dissolve the Three Passes, the spirits will settle in their palaces, the numinous will guard the Jade Gate. The knotted joints will dissolve of themselves; dead qi will vanish of itself. The ten thousand spirits will unite in radiance, and one will ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nAll people are born endowed with the qi of the Nine Heavens. Qi congeals into essence; essence transforms into cinnabar; cinnabar changes into a human being. The fetal bond is conceived and nurtured according to nature.\n\nHaving attained human form, one should return to nourish the original perfected. Let essence overflow the Six Palaces, qi descend to the Spirit Court. Within and without, one will be luminous and fresh, sharing the numinous with the perfected.\n\nThis method is lofty and wondrous, not transmitted to lesser immortals. Those who cultivate and attain the Dao will reverse white hair and halt aging, their lifespan equaling the Three Radiant Ones. Heaven and earth will incline toward them. If one rashly divulges its essentials, one’s person will be severely punished.\n\nAll scholars of the highest learning must first dissolve the knots of the Three Passes within the body.\n\nThe way to dissolve the knots also requires that, in the month of the fetal bond, one nourish the original essence. Let the dead knots sink and dissolve; the Nine Perfected will guard the numinous. True qi having descended, one will naturally attain longevity. When qi and image correspond, one will achieve success without study.\n\nIn practicing this method, suppose one was born in the seventh month—then the gestation is ten months. For a ten-month gestation, one receives the qi of the *Parinirmitavaśavartin* Heaven. On the first, eleventh, and twenty-first days of the tenth month, at dawn, noon, and midnight—three times in one month—bathe in fragrant water, burn incense, and enter the chamber. Face the northwest and bow nine times to the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens. Face the southeast and bow three times to the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Heavens. Then, sit upright facing the lunar station, knock the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize the Heavenly King of *Parinirmitavaśavartin*, surnamed Jade, named *Ling Wu*, clad in a nine-colored, seamless, dark-cloud treasure-fur robe, wearing a *Wuji Liuhuang Tianxing Feijing* crown, riding a five-colored cloud chariot, followed by twelve Jade Lads of the Grand Mystery, descending to enter one’s body and guard the Muddy Pellet Palace.\n\nVisualize verdant clouds swirling densely, crowning and enveloping your body. After a long while, draw the cloud-qi into your mouth and swallow it nine times, then softly intone:\n\nThe Primordial spreads qi, the Yang Dao opens and flows,\nThe Two Images descend in union, azure and yellow follow.\nAbove, they transform the Nine Elixirs; within the Three Palaces, essence congeals.\nForm accords with nature; qi accords with the Great Void.\nThe Thearch guards the numinous; the Mysterious Mother watches the chamber.\nThe myriad spirits settle in peace; the six viscera flourish within.\nThe Nine Heavens’ coronet and sash descend; the Three Radiances shed their light.\nThe Five Perfected assist and protect; the body returns to emptiness and hollowness.\nRiding the void, driving the floating, ascend to the Thearch’s hall.\n\nWhen finished, swallow qi nine more times, then swallow saliva twenty-four times to conclude. Thus the qi of the Nine Heavens nourishes the body, and when the time comes to form the embryo, stagnation, accumulations, and nodules will not arise again in the Three Passes. Practicing this for three years, one may foreknow events a myriad leagues away and the omens of fortune and misfortune. This is because the joints receive the real, and the orifices open to clarity.\n\nIn the eleventh month, receive the qi of *Brahmakāyika* Heaven. On the second, twelfth, and twenty-second days of the month, at dawn, noon, and midnight—three times in one month—bathe in fragrant water, burn incense, and enter the chamber. Face the northwest and bow nine times to the Primordial Father. Face the southeast and bow three times to the Mysterious Mother. Then, sit upright facing the lunar station, knock the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize the Heavenly King of *Brahmakāyika*, surnamed Mystery, named *Yun Hong*, clad in a nine-colored, phoenix-winged, soaring-cloud treasure-fur robe, wearing a *Xuanchen Chensing Liujing* crown, riding a white qilin-drawn, plain-cloud flying chariot, followed by thirty-two Jade Lads of Mount Taihua, descending to enter the Grotto Chamber within your body. Visualize emerald clouds swirling densely, crowning and enveloping your form. After a long while, draw the cloud-qi into your mouth and swallow it nine times, then softly intone:\n\nThe Nine Heavens’ flowing elixir transforms and congeals essence above;\nThe Primordial Father infuses qi; the Mysterious Mother receives the numinous.\nThe Five Flowers scatter radiance; the Three Perfected merge as one.\nThe Thearch commands the register; the Great One inscribes life.\nAbove, the Mysterious; below, the Yellow—within the Three Palaces, all is solemn and pure.\nThe nine orifices receive the real; the myriad spirits harmonize in peace.\nRiding the turning of the years, return to your original form.\nAscend with qi; be born with spirit.\nSoaring through the Mysterious Void, ascend to report at the Thearch’s court.\n\nWhen finished, swallow qi nine more times, then swallow saliva twenty-four times to conclude. Practicing this for three years, the intestines are refined and qi is augmented; one may foresee what has not yet come to pass. After nine years, the bones become light, and one ascends in broad daylight.\n\nIn the twelfth month, receive the qi of *Brahma-pāriṣadya* Heaven. On the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third days of the month, at dawn, noon, and midnight—three times in one month—bathe in fragrant water, burn incense, and enter the chamber. Face the northwest and bow nine times to the Primordial Father. Face the southeast and bow three times to the Mysterious Mother. Then, sit upright facing the lunar station, knock the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize the Heavenly King of *Brahma-pāriṣadya*, surnamed Essence, named *Wuyun Yao*, clad in a nine-colored, flowing-cloud, dawn-soaring treasure-fur robe, wearing a *Liudan Jiangguan*, *Yingxing Xuanjing* crown, riding a rosy-cloud, cinnabar-sky jade chariot with feathered canopy, followed by twelve Jade Immortals of the Upper Palace, descending to enter the Grotto Heaven Bright Hall within your body. Visualize violet clouds swirling densely, crowning and enveloping your form. After a long while, draw the cloud-qi into your mouth and swallow it nine times, then softly intone:\n\nThe Nine Elixirs flow with essence, transforming and congealing naturally.\nThe Primordial Father descends in mystery; the Mysterious Mother arrays the numinous.\nThe Thearch oversees the spirit; the Great One guards the real.\nThe Controller of Destinies inscribes the register; the Eastern Flower records the immortal.\nFlying blossoms of the August Mushroom irrigate the body’s form.\nThe Eight Radiances and Nine Qi refine and transform the root of the embryo.\nWithin the Three Palaces, the network congeals; the nine orifices receive the new.\nThe spirit is keen in the hidden passes; within, one perceives without obstruction.\nThe body transforms and the form changes, merging with qi like smoke.\nRiding the void, driving the empty, soar and ascend to the Thearch’s dawn.\n\nWhen finished, swallow qi nine more times, then swallow saliva twenty-four times to conclude. Practicing this for three years, the bones transform into jade, the spirit rejoices and qi abounds; one may foreknow future events not yet manifest. After nine years, the form changes, and one soars through the Great Void.\n\nIn the first month, receive the qi of *Parīttābha* Heaven. On the fourth, fourteenth, and twenty-fourth days of the month, at dawn, noon, and midnight—three times in one month—bathe in fragrant water, enter the chamber, and burn incense. Face the northwest and bow nine times to the Primordial Father. Face the southeast and bow three times to the Mysterious Mother. Then, sit upright facing the lunar station, knock the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize the Heavenly King of *Parīttābha*, surnamed Radiance, named *Zhao Yi*, clad in a nine-colored, flowing-light, luminous-cloud brocade robe, wearing a *White Radiance Tai Bai Yujing* crown, riding a flying phoenix-drawn, rosy-cloud purple chariot, followed by thirty-six Jade Immortals of the Great Perfected, descending to enter the Canopy Palace within your body. Visualize white clouds swirling densely, crowning and enveloping your form. After a long while, draw the cloud-qi into your mouth and swallow it nine times, then softly intone:\n\nThe Three unite as One; the Nine Transformations congeal the spirit.\nAbove opens; below expands—the Two Radiances entwine.\nYin and Yang flourish within, descending to my body.\nQi is endowed by the Nine Numinous; my name is inscribed in the Lofty Dawn.\nWithin the Three Palaces, the purple network accords with nature’s pattern.\nWithin and without, all is thoroughly pervaded; the bones transform into immortals.\nReturning qi and descending spirit, all the myriad spirits are fully possessed.\nWearing feathered robes, I am borne aloft to ascend the dawn.\n\nWhen finished, swallow qi nine times, then swallow saliva twenty-four times to conclude. Practicing this for three years, the lungs transform into gold, and the face takes on a jade-like complexion. After nine years, the spirit descends, and one ascends in broad daylight.\n\nIn the second month, receive the qi of *Apramāṇa-śubha* Heaven. On the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the month, at dawn, noon, and midnight—three times in one month—bathe in fragrant water, enter the chamber, and burn incense. Face the northwest and bow nine times to the Primordial Father. Face the southeast and bow three times to the Mysterious Mother. Then, sit upright facing the lunar station, knock the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize the Heavenly King of *Apramāṇa-śubha*, surnamed Congealment, named *Ning Yiwei*, clad in a nine-colored, flying-frost, cloud\n\nWhen the three harmonize to form the warp, the two spirits intermingle in peace, the Nine Perfected descend in streams, sun and moon flank like wings, the Seven Stars cast their dark radiance, the Five Lodges revolve like a canopy, the Three Passes shine brightly, the myriad spirits don their regalia, the nine apertures are cleansed and unobstructed, the six palaces receive their irrigation, inner flourishing manifests outwardly, and one perceives all without boundary—thus abiding long with Heaven and Earth, eternally partaking of the Four Greatnesses. This done, swallow the qi nine times, and swallow the saliva nine times to conclude.\n\nPracticing this for three years, the liver weaves into a purple network, jade-like luster emerges within, and inner and outer become luminously clear, allowing one to perceive the yet-unmanifest. After nine years, the spirit descends, and one ascends to the Nine Heavens in flight.\n\nIn the third month, receive the qi of *Jiran* Heaven. On the sixth, sixteenth, and twenty-sixth days of the month, at dawn, noon, and midnight—three times in one month—bathe in fragrant water, enter the chamber, and burn incense. Face the northwest and bow nine times to the Primordial Father. Face the southeast and bow three times to the Mysterious Mother. Then, sit upright facing the lunar station, knock the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize the Heavenly King of *Jiran*, surnamed *Jin*, named *Yanbi*, clad in a seven-colored, dragon-patterned, luminous robe, wearing a crown of yin-essence and night-light, riding an eight-scene flying chariot, accompanied by twelve jade immortals. Visualize them descending into the Longevity Palace within your body, seeing a verdant cloud of qi swirling densely around you. After a long while, draw the cloud-qi into the mouth and swallow it nine times, then softly intone:\n\nThe Supreme Dao is profound and obscure,\nthe mysterious qi subtly divides.\nThe Nine and Five flow forth,\nthe Eight Convergences command the Gate of Life.\nIn the Cinnabar Palace, the Red Child,\nreceiving qi from the Lord of the Empire,\nholds the Peach of Longevity and the Register of Life,\npresented to the Three Origins.\nThe host of perfected ones oversees and reflects,\nrefining the precious hun and po souls.\nInner freshness and outer radiance,\nthe spirit guards the hidden passes.\nThe Eight Scenes flank the body,\nthe Nine Qi descend with numinosity.\nSoaring through the mysterious void,\none ascends to the Gate of the Emperor.\n\nThis done, swallow the qi nine times, and swallow the saliva nine times to conclude.\n\nPracticing this for three years, the gallbladder transforms into jade frost, and purple mist congeals within. The nine apertures receive the spirit, allowing one to converse with the Red Child. After nine years, one obtains a purple canopy of dark clouds and ascends to the Nine Heavens.\n\nIn the fourth month, receive the qi of *Xuyan* Heaven. On the seventh, seventeenth, and twenty-seventh days of the month, at dawn, noon, and midnight—three times in one month—bathe in fragrant water, enter the chamber, and burn incense. Face the northwest and bow nine times to the Primordial Father. Face the southeast and bow three times to the Mysterious Mother. Then, sit upright facing the lunar station, knock the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize the Heavenly King of *Xuyan*, surnamed *Zi*, named *Yanbin*, clad in a nine-colored robe adorned with the patterns of the Three Dharmas, wearing a crown of Heavenly Origin and precious brightness, riding a nine-colored flying swan and three-pure flying clouds, accompanied by twenty-four jade maidens of pure spirit. Visualize them descending into the Yellow Court within your body, seeing a yellow cloud of qi swirling densely around you. After a long while, draw the cloud-qi into the mouth and swallow it nine times, then softly intone:\n\nThe three hun are now at peace,\nthe seven po now tranquil.\nHeaven arrays the Five Lodges,\nthe body models the Seven Stars.\nThe myriad spirits attend as wings,\nthe mysterious perfected exhale their numinosity.\nJade mushrooms flow and pour,\nthoroughly irrigating the five forms.\nInner fullness and outer overflow,\nthe hidden passes shine clearly.\nReturning to refine the marrow,\nreverting from white to green,\none roams the scenes with transformations,\nexiting the hidden and entering the obscure,\nriding the void to fly through space,\nascending to the Moon’s Court.\n\nThis done, swallow the qi nine times, and swallow the saliva nine times to conclude.\n\nPracticing this for three years, the spleen transforms into gold, and the body emits golden essence. One beholds the five viscera and converses with the Eight Scenes. After nine years, one soars in flight and ascends to the Jade Clarity.\n\nIn the fifth month, receive the qi of *Shangshang Chan Shan Wuliang Shou* Heaven.

Face the northwest and bow nine times to the Primordial Father. Face the southeast and bow three times to the Mysterious Mother. Then, sit upright facing the lunar station, knock the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize the Heavenly King of *Shangshang Chan Shan Wuliang Shou*, surnamed *Xi*, named *Yannan*, clad in a nine-colored cloud-patterned robe, wearing a crown of luminous essence and moonlight, riding twelve dark turtles and a flying azure feathered canopy, accompanied by thirty-two jade lads of the Upper Palace. Visualize them descending into the Double Union Palace within your body, seeing a purple cloud of qi swirling densely around you. After a long while, draw the cloud-qi into the mouth and swallow it nine times, then softly intone:\n\nThe Eight Scenes array their positions,\nthe myriad spirits align in order.\nThe five viscera blossom,\nthe nine apertures shine clearly.\nThe heart transforms into a king,\nthe bones turn to flying dust.\nRosy skirts flutter,\nfeathered capes drift like mist.\nThe inner perfected surge,\nflying in azure feathered robes.\nCloud chariots and purple canopies,\njade carriages return.\nConveying the immortal to soar,\nwinding and circling,\nI request to ascend in flight,\nrising to the Supreme Subtlety.\n\nThis done, swallow the qi nine times, and swallow the saliva nine times to conclude.\n\nPracticing this for three years, the kidneys transform and congeal into an immortal form, the entire body perfected. The Three Origins descend, and one ascends to Heaven in broad daylight.\n\nIn the sixth month, receive the qi of *Yudan Wuliang* Heaven. On the ninth, nineteenth, and twenty-ninth days of the month, at dawn, noon, and midnight—three times in one month—bathe in fragrant water, enter the chamber, and burn incense. Face the northwest and bow nine times to the Primordial Father. Face the southeast and bow three times to the Mysterious Mother. Then, sit upright facing the lunar station, knock the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize the Heavenly King of *Yudan Wuliang*, surnamed *Hun*, named *Shuangnan*, clad in a nine-colored, seamless, naturally patterned robe, wearing a crown of radiant essence and solar roundness, riding a nine-unicorn jade chariot, accompanied by twenty-four jade immortals. Visualize them descending into the Crimson Palace within your body, seeing a crimson cloud of qi swirling densely around you. After a long while, draw the cloud-qi into the mouth and swallow it nine times, then softly intone:\n\nThe qi of the Nine Heavens now fills and suffuses me, arraying the Eight Effulgences and ordering the Three Palaces. The ten thousand spirits take their stations, and numinous perfected ones commune; the Director of Destinies fixes my register, while the Great One lends support. The Three and the Five align in harmony, and I behold the revolutions of the Great Yang. Through three transformations and nine revolutions, I return to my imperial homeland. A golden chariot with a jade canopy, flanked by jade radiance, descends upon my body, settling within my Golden Hall. It guards me, accompanies me, and soars with me—ascending through the Great Mystery to feast in the Imperial Chamber.\n\nWhen this is complete, swallow the qi nine times, and swallow the saliva nine times to conclude.\n\nAfter three years of such practice, a jade blossom blooms within the heart, and the ten thousand qi transform into immortality. One perceives the hidden and scrutinizes the obscure, conversing with spirits as equals. After nine years, one rides the Eight Effulgences and soars into the Upper Clarity.\n\nFrom the tenth month of conception to the sixth month, the qi of the Nine Heavens is fully received. By the seventh month, combined with the tenth, the qi of Heaven and Earth reach fullness, and one is born through the revolutions of the Great Yang. Thus, on the tenth day at dawn, the twentieth day at noon, and the thirtieth day at midnight—three times each month—bathe in fragrant water, enter the chamber, and burn incense. Face the northwest and bow nine times, then turn to the southeast and bow three times. Return to sit upright facing your natal destiny, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and visualize the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens, whose tabooed name is *Zunhui*, descending from the northwest of Heaven into the Muddy Pellet Palace within your body. Visualize the Mysterious Mother, whose tabooed name is *Dunhuan*, descending from the southeast of Heaven into the Gate of Destiny within your Elixir Field.\n\nThe Primordial Father transforms into azure qi, descending from the Muddy Pellet Palace, while the Mysterious Mother transforms into yellow qi, ascending from the Gate of Destiny. The two qi converge within the Crimson Palace, blending into a golden hue and intertwining. In an instant, the azure qi becomes an infant, and the yellow qi becomes a phoenix. The phoenix holds in its beak the talisman of *Nine Elixirs Flowing Essence for Preserving Life*, feeding it to the infant’s mouth. Once the infant receives the talisman, it transforms into a round sun, emerging above the head, while the phoenix becomes a lunar effulgence, returning to the Gate of Destiny. The radiance of the sun and moon shine upon each other from afar, illuminating the entire body. Then, draw the essence of the sun eighty-one times and the light of the moon forty-five times, softly intoning:\n\nAbove, it transforms the hidden depths; below, it illumines the form with the Great Yang. The two qi unite and converge in the Crimson Palace. The Primordial transforms into an infant, the Mysterious into a phoenix—now separating, now merging, through nine transformations blending into gold. The sun and moon face each other, communicating above and below. The Imperial Spirit guards the left, while Peach Prosperity wings the right. White Prime and Limitless Flourishing abide in the Grotto Chamber. The ten thousand spirits gather in splendor, teeming and vast. Ascending and descending, they circulate essence, inwardly crystallizing jade radiance. Externally and internally, they display their feathered regalia. A dragon chariot arrives to welcome me, soaring through the Mysterious Void to ascend into the Great Emptiness.\n\nWhen this is complete, ingest the talisman of *Nine Elixirs Flowing Essence for Preserving Life*. Then, swallow the qi nine times and the saliva nine times to conclude.\n\nAfter three years of such practice, the Perfected One appears in form, the face bearing a golden countenance, the body emanating wondrous light. After nine years, one soars aloft and ascends to Heaven in broad daylight.\n\n**The Talisman of Nine Elixirs Flowing Essence for Preserving Life**\nInscribed in azure on bamboo membrane, face your natal destiny and ingest three talismans at the three periods of the day. This penetrates the abdomen, refines the marrow, transforms the bones, and coalesces the spirit. After three years, the entire body undergoes transmutation.\n\nBefore ingesting the talisman, intone:\nHeaven descends and Earth ascends; the two qi intermingle in abundance. The Nine Elixirs transform and change, crystallizing essence within the central chamber. The Eight Effulgences scatter their numinosity, and the Six Palaces flourish within. The ten thousand spirits unite in purity, eternally enjoying the Great Intestine. They traverse the ends of Heaven and Earth, their joy unending.\n\nWhen this is complete, ingest the talisman and swallow the nine qi to conclude.\n\nIn practicing this Dao, one must calculate the months of gestation and proceed accordingly, completing the full ten months. This is the *Record of Embryonic Essence within the Womb*, the root of immortal study and the wellspring of seeking life. Without this Dao, one’s diligence is in vain, bringing no benefit to body or spirit. If the body is not refined and the root of karma remains unsevered, the true spirit wanders astray. Even if cloud chariots descend, the body cannot ascend of its own accord.\n\nThis is the most secret of Dao, to be cautiously imparted only to the truly devoted. The covenant is solemn, and violations bring calamity upon oneself. Through secret cultivation and earnest devotion, one may attain transcendence and ascend to Heaven in broad daylight.\n\nIf the month of conception is unknown, use the month of one’s natal destiny as the gestational month and proceed accordingly. For example, if one’s natal destiny is in the first month (tiger), then the first month is the gestational month. Others should follow this model.\n\nThe *Record of Embryonic Essence Transformed by the Nine Elixirs* is also called *Luminous Womb of the Jade Embryo*. It arises at the inception of the Nine Mysteries, crystallizing the natural qi of the Great Emptiness to form its precious script. The Twenty-Four Perfected and the Thirty-Nine Emperors all practiced this method. The Supreme Thearch transmitted it to the Lady of the Southern Culmen, who transmitted it to the Thearch of the Grand Tenuity. The Thearch of the Grand Tenuity transmitted it to the Golden Portal Thearch of Later Saints, who transmitted it to the Azure Lad of the Supreme Minister. The Azure Lad compiled and arranged its sequence of practice, entrusting it to the Perfected One of the Western City. The Queen Mother of the West has now sealed one copy on Mount Fangzhang in Yingzhou.\n\nAccording to the statutes, those whose bones align with immortality after seven thousand years—whose names are recorded in the imperial register—may receive this transmission. In the present era, within seven hundred years, it may be transmitted three times. Those who obtain this text are attended by nine jade lads and nine jade maidens, who guard and protect the practitioner’s body.\n\nTo treat the sacred text with disrespect, transmit it to the unworthy, or reveal celestial secrets brings retribution upon one’s seven generations of ancestors, who are punished by the Three Officials. They are condemned to carry stones and pile mountains for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. One’s own body is subjected to trial, eternally confined to the earthly prisons, barred from entering immortality.\n\nWhen transmitting this scripture, master and disciple must face each other in a fast for ninety days, or at least thirty days. The disciple must offer one catty of gold, eighty feet of white silk, and one catty of elixir as tokens of the covenant’s sincerity. Kneeling and facing north, they swear the oath before transmission.\n\nThis must not be lightly transmitted. Without covenant or sincerity, practicing this Dao brings calamity upon the seven mysteries, and one’s own body bears the punishment. Burdened with guilt, one wanders the dark night for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. Practitioners must be prudent and cautious, never recklessly divulging this teaching.\n\nThe *Upper Clarity Scripture of the Nine Elixirs and the Record of Embryonic Essence Transformation in the Central Realm of Refinement* concludes. #1 The characters \"Table of Contents\" were added by the editor.",

      "translated_text": "**The Upper Clarity Scripture on the Nine Elixirs and the Transformation of Embryonic Essence: Central Record**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Upper Clarity Scripture on the Nine Elixirs and the Transformation of Embryonic Essence: Central Record* (abbreviated as *Central Record of Embryonic Essence*).\n\nAuthor unknown, approximately dated to the Eastern Jin dynasty. A foundational scripture of the early Shangqing (Upper Clarity) tradition. One fascicle.\n\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n**The Upper Clarity Scripture on the Nine Elixirs and the Transformation of Embryonic Essence: Central Record** (alternate title: *Nine Heavens’ Jade Embryo and Numinous Radiance*)\n\n**Table of Contents #1**\n- Talisman of the Nine Elixirs’ Yang Spirit for Upper Transformation\n- Talisman of Embryonic Essence for Refining the Spirit\n- Talisman of the Three Passes and Twelve Knots within the Embryonic Sac\n- Talisman of the Nine Elixirs’ Flowing Essence for Preserving Life\n\nThe text of the *Nine Elixirs’ Upper Transformation* was bestowed by the Lord Emperor of the Grand Tenuity upon the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens. It enables the ninefold cyclical refinement of essence, the return of spirit, the dissolution of the purple embryonic knots, and the nourishment of the primordial orifices with flowing essence. Internally, it fills the marrow; externally, it overflows through the nine apertures, brightening them. The bones are refined, and each joint receives the true. Its method is lofty and wondrous, concealed within the Golden Chamber and Jade Abode of the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Capital. According to the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, it is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas. Only those whose names are inscribed in the Purple Registers of the Upper Clarity in green script may partake of its teachings. Whoever violates its sacred prohibitions shall be smitten by divine soldiers. Those who cultivate it in secret and attain the Dao shall ascend as immortals in broad daylight.\n\nThe Venerable Person of the Nine Heavens addressed the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens: \"When heaven and earth exchange their revolutions, the two images merge into the true. Yin and yang descend their qi, corresponding above to the Nine Mysteries. The flowing elixir undergoes nine transformations, congealing qi into essence. Essence transforms into spirit, and spirit metamorphoses into humanity. Thus, humans mirror heaven and earth, and their qi follows the natural. The qi of the natural is the essence of the Nine Heavens, which, when transformed into the human body, is contained, nurtured, and nourished within the embryo. After nine months, the qi is full; the qi of the Nine Heavens is pervasive. In the tenth month, birth occurs. The formation of the embryo and its transformation may be auspicious or inauspicious, long-lived or short-lived, for these depend on the purity of the karmic roots and the congealed qi. If the viscera accumulate stagnation and the six palaces suffer damage, the form and spirit will not be firm, and the body will not receive the numinous. When the qi of death enters the orifices, how can one endure? Many engage in cultivation and study yet remain ignorant of this origin. Now, I reveal it to you: the true of a single form, when born, dissolves its knots, nourishes the hundred spirits, and the body naturally radiates light. The inner palaces become luminous, the spirit rests in its abode, and the myriad qi ascend as immortals. Guard this secret; do not lightly disclose it.\n\nAll who receive life form the nine elixirs’ upper transformation within the embryonic sac, following the qi of the Nine Heavens. When the qi is full and the spirit complete, they recognize within the embryonic membrane their past lives, know their original roots, and comprehend the karmic cycles of the Nine Heavens’ kalpas that shaped their bodies. Yet upon beholding the yang path and the vastness of the Three Luminaries, they forget the causes of their birth and origin. This arises from the stagnation of the embryonic roots, the blockage of the Three Passes, the disorder of the five palaces, and the obstruction of the gates by the qi of death, preventing the numinous passes from opening and causing the forgetting of karmic causes. If a numinous perfected one entrusts transformation, refining the jade embryo and briefly passing through the purple portal, treading the human path, they emerge naturally radiant, beholding the numinous with luminous splendor. They then ascend bodily to the Nine Heavens, no longer bound to the cycle of congealing essence and receiving qi to become human.\n\nThose who cultivate and study, aspiring to immortality, must refine the body with the nine elixirs, dissolve the knots of the five spirits, guide qi to its original birth, and extinguish the roots at the Three Gates. After nine refinements and ten transformations, the hundred joints become luminous. Once the embryonic knots are severed and the original true is known, one becomes an immortal of the highest rank. Without this method, the Three Palaces remain dull, the qi of death is not extinguished, the stomach does not receive the numinous, qi departs and spirit wanders, the Red Child is not joyful, the palaces lie abandoned, and demonic influences enter the body. Thus, the hundred ailments arise, life is not fulfilled, and the pain is beyond words.\n\nYang qi is red and is called the Mysterious Elixir. Yin qi is yellow and is called Yellow Essence. When yin and yang intersect and the two qi descend, essence transforms and spirit congeals, corresponding above to the Nine Heavens. The qi of the Nine Heavens then descends to fill the cinnabar field, merging with essence to congeal and unite at the Gate of Life. After nine cycles, this becomes the Nine Elixirs. Through upper transformation and lower congealment, a human is formed. In the first month, qi is received; in the second, the numinous; in the third, transformation is contained; in the fourth, essence congeals; in the fifth, the body and head take shape; in the sixth, the form is transformed; in the seventh, the spirit’s positions are arrayed; in the eighth, the nine orifices become bright; in the ninth, the qi of the Nine Heavens pervades, and sound emerges; in the tenth, the Director of Destinies inscribes the register, and life is received at birth. Thus, humans receive the qi of the Nine Heavens and the essence of yin and yang, called the Nine Elixirs, which together form the human body. Once born as human, one should return to the original true, regulate the five viscera, dissolve the embryonic roots, and sever the gates of death to naturally become an immortal.\n\nAll who are born within the embryonic sac receive the qi of the Nine Heavens, congealing essence to form the human body. Yet within the embryo, there are twelve knots that coil around the five viscera, causing stagnation and blockage, knots that cannot be dissolved, and nodes that cannot be extinguished. Thus, human illness arises from the stagnation of nodes, and the end of life comes from the fixation of knots. If one can dissolve the twelve embryonic knots, even the desire for death will be unattainable.\n\nThe upper part of the embryo has four knots: the first knot lies within the Muddy Pellet (brain), the second in the mouth, the third in the cheeks, and the fourth in the eyes. To dissolve the four upper knots, on the day of one’s original destiny at dawn, enter a chamber, burn incense, and bow nine times toward the northwest, facing the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens. Strike the teeth nine times, and thrice invoke the taboo name of the Primordial Father, *Zunhui*. Then bow three times toward the southeast, thrice invoking the taboo name of the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Heavens, *Dunhuan*. Sit upright according to your original destiny, close your eyes, and visualize the Primordial Father: his body is nine inches and nine fen tall, clad in a sash of dark yellow and plain numinous silk. He wears a crown of accumulated nine-tiered pearls and jade, the *Wujijinxian* cap, and resides in the Jade Capital of the Supreme Ultimate within the Nine Heavens, the Treasure Palace of the Cinnabar Numinous Realm in the Cavern of Primordial Purity. He rides a flying chariot of azure radiance, attended by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending from the northwest to enter your body and govern the realm of the Muddy Pellet.\"",

Thrice invoke the Primordial Father’s taboo name, *Zunhui*; then turn to the southeast and bow three times, facing the Mysterious Mother. Thrice invoke the Mysterious Mother’s taboo name, *Dunhuan*. Sit upright upon your current year’s position, knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, and visualize the Primordial Father: his form stands nine inches and nine fen tall, clad in a sash of dark yellow and plain numinous silk, his head crowned with a seven-tiered pearl-and-jade cap, the *Wuji Jinxian* coronet, dwelling in the Jade Capital of the Supreme Ultimate within the Nine Heavens, the Vermilion Numinous Precinct of the Cavernous Origin within the Treasure Palace of the Cinnabar Spirit Realm. He rides a flying chariot of azure radiance, accompanied by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending from the northwest to enter the Five Viscera within your body.\n\nNext, visualize the Mysterious Mother: her form stands six inches and six fen tall, clad in a nine-colored sash of luminous brocade, frost-silk, and divine light, her head crowned with the *Ziyuan Xuanhuang* treasure coronet. She dwells in the Sevenfold Radiance Vermilion Chamber of the Nine Qi’s Primordial Ultimate, the Treasure Palace of the Cavernous Origin within the Nine Radiance Precinct of the Upper Clarity Realm. She rides a feathered canopy of flying essence upon purple clouds, accompanied by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, descending from the southeast to enter your Five Viscera.\n\nVisualize the father and mother transforming into blue and yellow qi, merging into a chaos as round as the sun, illuminating the Five Viscera, their radiance shining within and without.

He governs from the Vermilion Chamber of the Upper Palace in the Heavenly Jade Grove, riding a flying phoenix and soaring auroral purple wheel, accompanied by thirty-six jade immortals of the Grand Perfected.\n\nFinally, visualize the Three Heavenly Perfected Kings descending together into the Five Viscera within your body, transforming into red, white, and black qi, merging into a chaos like cloudy mist. They enter through the aperture of the heart, suffusing the Five Viscera entirely. Then softly intone:\n\n*\"Nine elixirs congeal in the auroral void,\nThree qi intertwine and bind.\nProfound truth fills and descends,\nWithin and without, bright and clear.\nThe Great Granary opens and closes,\nIntestines and stomach knot into immortals.\nSever and extinguish the stem of nodes,\nDispel and dissolve the roots of old.\nThree harmonies form a covenant,\nNine transformations congeal the spirit.\nReturning essence to the jade womb,\nTo perfect this body of mine.\nNine-colored dark yellow,\nFlowing essence to irrigate fluids.\nScouring and washing away stagnations,\nWithin, no dregs or dust remain.\nFlourishing branches unite in splendor,\nPlanting and nurturing the numinous root.\nEach aperture grows limpid and bright,\nEach node becomes cool and serene.\nBones transform into radiant flight,\nAscending into the Purple Heavens.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow nine breaths upward and cease.\n\nNext, visualize the Eight Radiant Divine Lads of the Middle Realm. Close the eyes and summon the spirit of the throat: named *Hundred Streams Flow*, styled *Dao Tong*, his form eight inches tall, clad in nine-colored patterned robes, his head crowned with the *Level Heaven Purple Dawn* coronet. The spirit of the lungs: named *Plain Numinous Life*, styled *Dao Ping*, his form eight inches and one fen tall, clad in white brocade and flying cloud robes, his head crowned with the *Nine Origins Treasure Coronet*.

The spirit of the left kidney: named *Spring Origin Perfected*, styled *Dao Qing*, his form three inches and seven fen tall, clad in five-colored transforming light skirts, his head crowned with the *Wandering Coronet*. The spirit of the right kidney: named *Image Other None*, styled *Dao Sheng*, his form three inches and five fen tall, clad in white brocade robes, his head crowned with the *Three Qi Treasure Radiance Coronet*. The spirit of the spleen: named *Treasure Origin Complete*, styled *Dao Qian*, his form seven inches and three fen tall, clad in yellow brocade flying skirts, his head crowned with the *Purple Dawn Coronet*.\n\nWhen the visualization of the Eight Radiant Lads is complete, they all appear in the form of infants, uniting within the Five Viscera, each settling into its proper place. Then knock the teeth eight times and raise your head to intone:\n\n*\"Eight Radiant Lads of the Middle Realm,\nTransforming ninefold above,\nRefining essence into the jade womb,\nKnots of qi in the Purple Tenuity.\nRefining the hun and solidifying the po,\nAll spirits gather and return.\nThe Emperor unbinds the knots,\nNine orifices scatter and open.\nThe Mysterious Mother descends with numinosity,\nEach node receives its radiance.\nWithin, replete; without, overflowing,\nFlourishing light never wanes.\nAttaining union with the Eight Radiant,\nRiding the same chariot to fly,\nThe mandate of my original destiny begins,\nAs I have visualized and returned.\nCarry me upward in ascent,\nParting the gates of the numinous to behold.\"*",

Practicing this for three years, one’s face will radiate jade light, the body will reflect golden perfection, flesh will diminish, bones will become light, and the inner knots will transform into an immortal. After nine years, the numinous descends, and one ascends to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThose who study without this method labor in vain. The knots remain undissolved, coiled and entangled day by day. Spirit and qi do not spread; malevolent influences enter the body. The wandering hun scatter—how can one attain immortality?\n\nSincere and devoted scholars must diligently seek this source. Dissolving the knots at the three hours, one will surely attain the highest immortality.\n\nThe *Returning Womb’s Jade Splendor* gathers the Three Passes and receives the perfected. The Three Regions and Eight Radiant Ones, the Twenty-Four Spirits, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, together ride the purple mist.\n\nThe sublime and wondrous transformation, the *Numinous Writ of the Jade Emperor*—if rashly transmitted or lightly divulged, calamity will extend to the seven ancestors. The dead souls will fill the debt, forever submerged in the river’s source. One’s own person will bear the punishment, suffering the Three Paths and Five Torments, for ten thousand kalpas without release. Scholars, be cautious and guard these words in secret.\n\nThe spirits of the Two Radiant Ones are all the transformed spiritual essences of the Nine Heavens. The Primordial Father transforms above; the Mysterious Mother forms the womb. The Nine Heavens nurture and rear, completing the human being. The Twenty-Four Persons each possess numinous passes.\n\nIf one wishes to cultivate and study yet does not know how to visualize their forms, the spirits will wander and qi will scatter. Dead qi will knot and sink; malevolent demons will enter the radiance, shortening life and cutting short the years.\n\nIf one knows how to cultivate and dissolve the Three Passes, the spirits will settle in their palaces, the numinous will guard the Jade Gate. The knotted joints will dissolve of themselves; dead qi will vanish of itself. The ten thousand spirits will unite in radiance, and one will ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nAll people are born endowed with the qi of the Nine Heavens. Qi congeals into essence; essence transforms into cinnabar; cinnabar changes into a human being. The fetal bond is conceived and nurtured according to nature.\n\nHaving attained human form, one should return to nourish the original perfected. Let essence overflow the Six Palaces, qi descend to the Spirit Court. Within and without, one will be luminous and fresh, sharing the numinous with the perfected.\n\nThis method is lofty and wondrous, not transmitted to lesser immortals. Those who cultivate and attain the Dao will reverse white hair and halt aging, their lifespan equaling the Three Radiant Ones. Heaven and earth will incline toward them. If one rashly divulges its essentials, one’s person will be severely punished.\n\nAll scholars of the highest learning must first dissolve the knots of the Three Passes within the body.\n\nThe way to dissolve the knots also requires that, in the month of the fetal bond, one nourish the original essence. Let the dead knots sink and dissolve; the Nine Perfected will guard the numinous. True qi having descended, one will naturally attain longevity. When qi and image correspond, one will achieve success without study.\n\nIn practicing this method, suppose one was born in the seventh month—then the gestation is ten months. For a ten-month gestation, one receives the qi of the *Parinirmitavaśavartin* Heaven. On the first, eleventh, and twenty-first days of the tenth month, at dawn, noon, and midnight—three times in one month—bathe in fragrant water, burn incense, and enter the chamber. Face the northwest and bow nine times to the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens. Face the southeast and bow three times to the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Heavens. Then, sit upright facing the lunar station, knock the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize the Heavenly King of *Parinirmitavaśavartin*, surnamed Jade, named *Ling Wu*, clad in a nine-colored, seamless, dark-cloud treasure-fur robe, wearing a *Wuji Liuhuang Tianxing Feijing* crown, riding a five-colored cloud chariot, followed by twelve Jade Lads of the Grand Mystery, descending to enter one’s body and guard the Muddy Pellet Palace.",

      "translated_text": "The qi of the Nine Heavens now fills and suffuses me, arraying the Eight Effulgences and ordering the Three Palaces. The ten thousand spirits take their stations, and numinous perfected ones commune; the Director of Destinies fixes my register, while the Great One lends support. The Three and the Five align in harmony, and I behold the revolutions of the Great Yang. Through three transformations and nine revolutions, I return to my imperial homeland. A golden chariot with a jade canopy, flanked by jade radiance, descends upon my body, settling within my Golden Hall. It guards me, accompanies me, and soars with me—ascending through the Great Mystery to feast in the Imperial Chamber.\n\nWhen this is complete, swallow the qi nine times, and swallow the saliva nine times to conclude.\n\nAfter three years of such practice, a jade blossom blooms within the heart, and the ten thousand qi transform into immortality. One perceives the hidden and scrutinizes the obscure, conversing with spirits as equals. After nine years, one rides the Eight Effulgences and soars into the Upper Clarity.\n\nFrom the tenth month of conception to the sixth month, the qi of the Nine Heavens is fully received. By the seventh month, combined with the tenth, the qi of Heaven and Earth reach fullness, and one is born through the revolutions of the Great Yang. Thus, on the tenth day at dawn, the twentieth day at noon, and the thirtieth day at midnight—three times each month—bathe in fragrant water, enter the chamber, and burn incense. Face the northwest and bow nine times, then turn to the southeast and bow three times. Return to sit upright facing your natal destiny, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and visualize the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens, whose tabooed name is *Zunhui*, descending from the northwest of Heaven into the Muddy Pellet Palace within your body. Visualize the Mysterious Mother, whose tabooed name is *Dunhuan*, descending from the southeast of Heaven into the Gate of Destiny within your Elixir Field.\n\nThe Primordial Father transforms into azure qi, descending from the Muddy Pellet Palace, while the Mysterious Mother transforms into yellow qi, ascending from the Gate of Destiny. The two qi converge within the Crimson Palace, blending into a golden hue and intertwining. In an instant, the azure qi becomes an infant, and the yellow qi becomes a phoenix. The phoenix holds in its beak the talisman of *Nine Elixirs Flowing Essence for Preserving Life*, feeding it to the infant’s mouth. Once the infant receives the talisman, it transforms into a round sun, emerging above the head, while the phoenix becomes a lunar effulgence, returning to the Gate of Destiny. The radiance of the sun and moon shine upon each other from afar, illuminating the entire body. Then, draw the essence of the sun eighty-one times and the light of the moon forty-five times, softly intoning:\n\nAbove, it transforms the hidden depths; below, it illumines the form with the Great Yang. The two qi unite and converge in the Crimson Palace. The Primordial transforms into an infant, the Mysterious into a phoenix—now separating, now merging, through nine transformations blending into gold. The sun and moon face each other, communicating above and below. The Imperial Spirit guards the left, while Peach Prosperity wings the right. White Prime and Limitless Flourishing abide in the Grotto Chamber. The ten thousand spirits gather in splendor, teeming and vast. Ascending and descending, they circulate essence, inwardly crystallizing jade radiance. Externally and internally, they display their feathered regalia. A dragon chariot arrives to welcome me, soaring through the Mysterious Void to ascend into the Great Emptiness.\n\nWhen this is complete, ingest the talisman of *Nine Elixirs Flowing Essence for Preserving Life*. Then, swallow the qi nine times and the saliva nine times to conclude.\n\nAfter three years of such practice, the Perfected One appears in form, the face bearing a golden countenance, the body emanating wondrous light. After nine years, one soars aloft and ascends to Heaven in broad daylight.\n\n**The Talisman of Nine Elixirs Flowing Essence for Preserving Life**\nInscribed in azure on bamboo membrane, face your natal destiny and ingest three talismans at the three periods of the day. This penetrates the abdomen, refines the marrow, transforms the bones, and coalesces the spirit. After three years, the entire body undergoes transmutation.\n\nBefore ingesting the talisman, intone:\nHeaven descends and Earth ascends; the two qi intermingle in abundance. The Nine Elixirs transform and change, crystallizing essence within the central chamber. The Eight Effulgences scatter their numinosity, and the Six Palaces flourish within. The ten thousand spirits unite in purity, eternally enjoying the Great Intestine. They traverse the ends of Heaven and Earth, their joy unending.\n\nWhen this is complete, ingest the talisman and swallow the nine qi to conclude.\n\nIn practicing this Dao, one must calculate the months of gestation and proceed accordingly, completing the full ten months. This is the *Record of Embryonic Essence within the Womb*, the root of immortal study and the wellspring of seeking life. Without this Dao, one’s diligence is in vain, bringing no benefit to body or spirit. If the body is not refined and the root of karma remains unsevered, the true spirit wanders astray. Even if cloud chariots descend, the body cannot ascend of its own accord.\n\nThis is the most secret of Dao, to be cautiously imparted only to the truly devoted. The covenant is solemn, and violations bring calamity upon oneself. Through secret cultivation and earnest devotion, one may attain transcendence and ascend to Heaven in broad daylight.\n\nIf the month of conception is unknown, use the month of one’s natal destiny as the gestational month and proceed accordingly. For example, if one’s natal destiny is in the first month (tiger), then the first month is the gestational month. Others should follow this model.\n\nThe *Record of Embryonic Essence Transformed by the Nine Elixirs* is also called *Luminous Womb of the Jade Embryo*. It arises at the inception of the Nine Mysteries, crystallizing the natural qi of the Great Emptiness to form its precious script. The Twenty-Four Perfected and the Thirty-Nine Emperors all practiced this method. The Supreme Thearch transmitted it to the Lady of the Southern Culmen, who transmitted it to the Thearch of the Grand Tenuity. The Thearch of the Grand Tenuity transmitted it to the Golden Portal Thearch of Later Saints, who transmitted it to the Azure Lad of the Supreme Minister. The Azure Lad compiled and arranged its sequence of practice, entrusting it to the Perfected One of the Western City. The Queen Mother of the West has now sealed one copy on Mount Fangzhang in Yingzhou.\n\nAccording to the statutes, those whose bones align with immortality after seven thousand years—whose names are recorded in the imperial register—may receive this transmission. In the present era, within seven hundred years, it may be transmitted three times. Those who obtain this text are attended by nine jade lads and nine jade maidens, who guard and protect the practitioner’s body.\n\nTo treat the sacred text with disrespect, transmit it to the unworthy, or reveal celestial secrets brings retribution upon one’s seven generations of ancestors, who are punished by the Three Officials. They are condemned to carry stones and pile mountains for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. One’s own body is subjected to trial, eternally confined to the earthly prisons, barred from entering immortality.\n\nWhen transmitting this scripture, master and disciple must face each other in a fast for ninety days, or at least thirty days. The disciple must offer one catty of gold, eighty feet of white silk, and one catty of elixir as tokens of the covenant’s sincerity. Kneeling and facing north, they swear the oath before transmission.\n\nThis must not be lightly transmitted. Without covenant or sincerity, practicing this Dao brings calamity upon the seven mysteries, and one’s own body bears the punishment. Burdened with guilt, one wanders the dark night for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. Practitioners must be prudent and cautious, never recklessly divulging this teaching.",

Visualize them descending into the Crimson Palace within your body, seeing a crimson cloud of qi swirling densely around you. After a long while, draw the cloud-qi into the mouth and swallow it nine times, then softly intone:",
