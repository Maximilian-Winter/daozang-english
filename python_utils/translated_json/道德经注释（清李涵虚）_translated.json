This is but our humble retreat.\n\nOne day, wandering through the Daoist observatories, I found several volumes of *The Outer History of Yuanqiao*, expounding on the art of prolonging life—never straying from Laozi’s Way.\nAmong them was *Thirteen Classics Commentary*, all Laozi’s works.\nThe commentary on the *Dao De Jing* was the most meticulous.\nAt its end, *The Nine-Layer Path* was appended—even more straightforward and accessible. I inquired of a Daoist priest: *“Who is Master Shuxia?”*\nHe replied: *“He hides among farmers.”*\nI then sought Master Shuxia at Juanshan, and he proved a kindred spirit in the Daoist tradition, imparting the true essence.\nUpon returning, I published the *Thirteen Classics* in the marketplace, as a token of my gratitude for his benevolence.\nExternally, I printed and distributed the *Dao De Jing* and *Nine-Layer Path* to the Lin Palace monasteries.\n\nThis work, though concise, contains the complete essence.\nWe few can practice it easily, perfecting ourselves and others—here lies its power.\n\nMoreover, recalling the saying *“Those who receive the book as disciples”*:\nEach follows their own Daoist lineage, establishing names beyond the world, like the great rivers flowing into streams and brooks.\n\nZixia received teachings from Huizong, and we inherit from Zixia—thus, our lineage is clear.\n\nAlas! In the affairs of Heaven and Earth, those like us—simple folk—need not contend, nor can we.\n\n「Master Dao Yu is now seventy, Master Dao Sheng is nearing ancient old age, and Master Dao He is no longer a youth. Within the mountains and forests, what joy could there be? Only by bearing this single commentary on the *Dao De Jing* and this one treatise of the *Nine-Layer Path* do we find delight, singing long songs in the cliffs and valleys, our voices echoing to silence the clouds of the streams. Each of us forgets our names and the cycles of time.\n\nIn the month of *Rui* (mid-autumn) of the *Zun* cycle (1899), the three recluses of Shu Mountain recognized Dao Guang’s gentle and profound essence. Pure Yang Master prefaced the *Dao De Jing*, advocating *wu wei* (non-action) in action. The *Justice* commentary elucidates without contrivance. The Dao Ancestors transmitted it, and the Dao descendants expounded upon it—thus, the Great Dao becomes ever clearer here.\n\nAmong them, there is the *Hanyuzi* (Embracing the Void), a man of transcendent talent. His *Jin Shu* (Golden Book) was revealed in dreams, born in a humble home beneath a tree. He dwells in the *Juan Shan* (卷山), passing down a tradition of sincerity and purity. The *Zai Shi* (載錫) jade tablet was indeed fitting for him. As a youth, he attained sudden enlightenment; as an adult, he practiced profound meditation. Once reading *The Outer History of the Fang Hu* (方壶外史), he secretly aspired to attain the True and enter the Mysterious, standing beside the Master Lu (陸子) at my side.\n\nI heard of him and sought him out. He introduced himself as a Daoist of *Wu Shan* (吾山), and with *Qian Xu* (潛虚), I accompanied him to observe his spirit and resolve. He resided in obscurity on the eastern slopes of *E Peak* (峨峰), serene and quiet, speaking little, unmoved by honor and profit. He often satisfied his aspirations with a single lute.\n\nAfter meeting him, I remained with him for years, during which he spoke to me of the *Heavy Mysterious* (重玄) teachings, and I understood them instantly. Thus, he exerted his talent and strength, composing *The Outer History of the Yuan Shao* (圆峤外史), a counterpart to Master Lu’s *Fang Hu* (方壶).\n\nTherefore, where Master Lu has *The Theory of Mysterious Skin* (玄肤论), here we have *The Discussion on Daoist Insights* (道窍谈); where Master Lu has *The Chapter on Rectification* (就正篇), here we have *The Treatise on Following the Dao* (循途说). These are all texts of the Clear and True Dao. Yet his most wondrous work is the commentary on the *Dao De Jing*, which is indeed a beacon for all ages, named *The Eastern Justice* (东来正义), rivaling Master Lu’s *The Supplementary Notes on the Southern Flower* (南华副墨). If these two Masters are considered, they may truly be called those who excel in discussing Laozi and Zhuangzi.\n\nNow, those who comment on this scripture have five flaws and three virtues. The five flaws are: favoring discussions of governing the world, the first. Favoring discussions of cultivating the body, the second. Some may say the Dao encompasses both body and world, yet their words lack coherence and ultimately stray into error, the third. Not understanding the true practice of the Great Dao, they first demand the people’s peace and the nation’s wealth before achieving *wu wei* (non-action), and if they immediately discuss purity and stillness, they will inevitably fall into emptiness, the fourth. Not recognizing the profound power of the Great Dao, they insist on returning to the root and obeying the command, thus counting as *you wei* (action). If they immediately discuss the sacred and divine, they will inevitably become like mere hymns, the fifth.\n\nWhat are the three virtues? The first is that his commentary aligns with the inner and outer aspects of the Dao, dividing it into primary and supplementary, thereby illuminating the scripture’s expansive meaning. The second is that his teachings are sequential and interwoven, ensuring the scripture’s principles are thoroughly connected. The third is that his heart holds true understanding, and his words are unobstructed by *Chan* (禅) barriers, allowing the scripture’s meaning to shine forth.\n\nI have often lamented that the essence of the *Dao De Jing* has not been made clear throughout the world. I wished to write a commentary to explain it, yet even now, I feel inadequate. Now, seeing *Hanyuzi*’s exposition, it possesses the three virtues without the five flaws. If his work had appeared a thousand years earlier, all other commentaries could have been unnecessary, and Daoists would not need to speak further.\n\nThus, I rejoice in presenting it and marking its significance, storing it in the sacred mountains and passing it to those of noble resolve. The purpose of my annotations is also to borrow the truth of his commentary, supplement what I have not yet explained, and demonstrate it through my own annotations.\n\n**Poem on *The Eastern Justice* (东来正义)**\nThe Revered Daoist Huizong first established the preface and commentary—\nHis own preface uniquely opens the gate to virtue.\n\nAgain, I see the Purple Qi from Guanzhong arrive,\nDirectly observing the Jade Son beneath the plum tree.\n\nHe wishes to teach the later generations to measure the Dao together,\nAnd can make the Primordial Dao yet more honored.\n\nHow many commentators lack such a foundation?\nThe treasure is long protected, guarding the Kunlun peaks.\n\n—By *Yuzhu Right Minister* (玉枢右相), *Taoqing Master of the Great Mystery* (太清洞玄校理), practicing merit and demerit, concurrently selecting matters of the Dao and the Immortal, the *Xuanxuan Daoist of Liaodong* (辽东玄玄道人), and disciple Zhang Quan Yi (侍友张全一) who inscribed this at Qingfu (青阜).\n\nOne commentary can reveal the Dao’s profound mysteries—\nAgain, I see the Purple Qi arriving from the East.\n\nStrumming the lute and playing the flute, a true gentleman,\nDiscussing the scripture and expounding the law, a master of eloquence.\n\nI dwell in the Fang Hu, playing with the boundless sea,\nYou ascend the Yuan Shao, dominating the Penglai peaks.\n\nToday, we sit together on the riverside pavilion,\nReciting the *Southern Flower* (南华) while laughing at our own folly.\n\n—By *True Scripture of the Three Pure Ones* (三清总校真函), concurrently recording the secrets of the *Tongtian* (洞天), *Master of Universal Salvation* (文明普度先生), *Eastern Dao Ancestor* (东派祖师), *Fellow of the Immortal Histories Hall* (同仙史馆), and junior disciple Lu Xixing (愚弟陆西星) who inscribed this.\n\nThe body resides in the Cloud Mountains, the Dao within oneself—\nThe depths of spirit and *qi* are most profound and mighty.\n\nAt Qingdao, the strict *Zhi* (驰) is externally practiced,\nWhile the flames are stilled in the *Dantian* (丹田), guarding the inner stillness.\n\nPeople call him the Great Abbot,\nI jokingly name him Lord of the Long Wall.\n\nLeaning on the *Dao De Jing*’s commentary and annotations,\nHis enlightenment of all scriptures is equally profound.\n\n—By *Heavenly Immortal Baiqiong Guan* (天仙白琼管) who inscribed this.\n\n**Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* (*The Eastern Justice* (东严正义))**\nWritten by the owner of the *Zixia Cave* (紫霞洞) in *Yuan Shao Mountain* (圆峤山), *Hanyuzi* (涵虚生), and perfumed by respectful dedication.\n\nPublished by Daoist disciples Zhu Dao Sheng (朱道生) and Li Dao Yu (李道育), revised at the *Yueyang Pavilion* (岳阳楼). Chapter One.»\n\nThe **Dao** that can be spoken of is not the eternal **Dao**;\nThe **name** that can be named is not the eternal **name**.\n\nThe **Dao** is that which, internally, governs the self,\nExternally, governs the world—\nThe **Way** of daily life, ever practiced.\n\nThe **Dao** in its hidden depths is beyond speech,\nYet when it manifests, it can be spoken of.\nIt encompasses manifestation within concealment,\nBoundless yet infinitesimal—\nThus, the **Dao** is the **Dao** beyond the ordinary.\n\nThe **name** in the formless void is beyond naming,\nYet when it emerges in the **Tai Ji** (太极), it can be named.\nIt generates the **Tai Ji** from the void—\nCapable of stillness, capable of motion—\nThus, the **name** is the **name** beyond the ordinary.\n\n**Collective Annotation:** What all follow is called the **Dao**.\nWhat can be spoken of is what can be described.\nThe **Dao** beyond the ordinary—this is the **Great Dao**.\n\nTo mark its form, one speaks of **name**.\nWhat can be named is what can be likened.\nThe **name** beyond the ordinary—this is the **name** without fixed designation.\n\n---\nThe **nameless** is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nThe **named** is the mother of all things.\n\n**Nameless:** That is the **Wu Ji** (无极).\n**Named:** That is the **Tai Ji**.\n\nFrom non-being to being—\nThis is the true **nameless** without fixed designation.\n\nIn the primordial **Wu Ji**, undifferentiated,\nNo signs, no form—\nOriginally beyond likeness of sound or scent,\nThus the **Dao** is at the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAfter the **Tai Ji** manifests distinctly,\nThere is birth, there is nurturing—\nEvidence of creation’s workings,\nThus the **Dao** is the mother of all things.\n\n**All things**—\nEncompassing Heaven and Earth in totality.\nBefore Heaven and Earth, this **Dao** exists,\nGiving rise to Heaven, Earth, humans, and all beings—\nLike a great parent, beyond compare.\nSpeaking of mother, yet father is implied within.\n\n---\nThus, to observe its subtlety, one must be ever without desire,\nTo observe its limits, one must be ever with desire.\n\n**Subtlety**—that which is **nameless**—thus still,\nEver quiet to observe it.\n**Limits**—that which is **named**—thus dynamic,\nEver responsive to observe it.\nWithout desire, with desire—\nEver still, ever responsive.\n\nTo observe the **nameless** with no desire,\nTo observe the **named** with desire.\nThe **Dan** (alchemical) school regards the **Xuan Guan** (玄关) as the subtle orifice of **having** and **non-being**,\nFor it is rooted in this principle.\n\n---\nThese two—\nSame origin, yet different names,\nBoth called **Xuan** (玄).\n**Xuan**, again **Xuan**—\nThe gateway to all subtleties.\n\n**Two**—that is the **subtlety of the orifice**.\nBeing arises from non-being—\nSame origin, yet non-being transforms into being—\nDifferent names, yet still the same.\n\nThe **orifice of having and non-being**—\nBoth are **Xuan**.\nObserving subtlety with no desire—\nOne **Xuan** attained.\nObserving the orifice with desire—\nAnother **Xuan** attained.\nTwo **Xuans** converge into one **Xuan**.\n**Xuan** encompasses all subtleties—\nThe gateway to all subtleties lies here.\n\n**Chapter Two**\n(*River Above Master’s annotation* originally titled *Chapter on Nurturing the Body*, alternatively *Chapter on Beauty and Virtue*.)\n\n---\nAll under Heaven know beauty when it is called beauty—\nThen ugliness arises;\nAll know virtue when it is called virtue—\nThen non-virtue arises.\n\nThus, **having and non-being** generate each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete one another,\nLength and shortness define each other,\nHigh and low contrast each other—\n(*High* refers to elevation, *contrasting* refers to reversal.)\n\nSounds harmonize with one another,\nFront and back follow one another.\n(*\"Node\"* here is a variant of *\"form\"*—other editions read *\"compare\"* [较].)\n\n**Already**—*stop* also, *depart* also, as in *The Broad Rhymes*.\n\nNow, beauty and ugliness are most opposites.\nKnowing beauty as beauty—then ugliness must cease.\nVirtue and non-virtue are most distant.\nKnowing virtue as virtue—then non-virtue must depart.\n\nThe **original purity** of humankind is all beauty and virtue.\nYet when stained by later **human desires**,\nThen ugliness and non-virtue arise.\n\nBut one cannot fail to discard human desires\nAnd seek one’s original purity.\n\nOnly by taking **emptiness and responsiveness** as essence,\nAnd **transformation and motion** as function,\nDoes one attain:\nHaving arises from non-being, non-being from having;\nFirst difficulty, then ease;\nLength defines shortness, shortness defines length;\nHigh and low reverse each other;\nSame kinds seek each other, like sounds resonating;\nThe child follows behind—\nThe returning cycle descends before.\n\nThis is the **Dao of nurturing the body**.\n\nThus, the **Sage** dwells in **non-action**,\nPractices **non-speech** teaching;\nAll things arise yet are not claimed,\nAre born yet not possessed,\nAre done yet not relied upon,\nAre accomplished yet not dwelled upon.\nOnly by not dwelling does one not depart.\n\nThis follows from the previous discussion of nurturing the body.\nThe Sage’s nurturing of the body is **non-action**.\nThe Sage’s teaching is **non-speech**.\nDwelling in it fulfills one’s aspiration,\nPracticing it yields inner attainment.\nAll things spontaneously arise, awaiting the Sage’s harmonization,\nYet the Sage does not claim them.\nNot only does the Sage not claim them—\nEven the merit of nurturing the people is not possessed by the Sage.\nThe merit of governance is not relied upon by the Sage.\nWhen great deeds are accomplished, one rests—\nAs when the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao at Kongtong,\nOr the Yu Emperor, weary, ascended to his throne.\n\nLater heroes and outstanding figures,\nOnce their deeds were done, retired with courage—\nNone dwelled upon their achievements.\nNot dwelling means not clinging.\nOnly by not clinging to deeds\nDoes one return to seek the Dao of nurturing the body.\nGuarding the body without departing,\nOne becomes a **Perfect Person**.\n\nNurturing the body can govern the world,\nCultivating oneself can cultivate others—\nThus is it.\n\nWho would say the **Dao of Laozi** is entirely about stillness and extinction?\n\n**Chapter Three**\n(*River Above Master’s annotation* originally titled *Chapter on Settling the People*, Peng’s edition titled *Chapter on Non-Action*)\n\nNot elevating the worthy—so the people do not contend;\nNot treasuring hard-to-obtain goods—so the people do not steal;\nNot displaying what is desirable—so the heart does not乱.\nThus, the **Sage’s** governance:\nEmpties the heart, fills the belly,\nWeakens the will, strengthens the bones.\nAlways keeping the people in **ignorance and desirelessness**,\nSo that even the wise dare not act.\n\nPractice **non-action**, and nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nThe final passage of the previous chapter spoke of the Sage’s governance of the world,\nHow, once deeds were done, one did not dwell upon them,\nBut returned to seek the Dao of nurturing the body.\n\nYet even in governance, the **Dao** is this:\nNot competing with the people in valuing the worthy,\nThen the heart of contention fades, and the people do not contend.\nNot competing with the people in valuing goods,\nThen the heart of greed is severed, and the people do not steal.\nNot displaying what is desirable while desiring it,\nThen the heart of desire is removed.\nThe people’s hearts, thus, do not乱,\nAnd the Sage’s heart, thus, does not乱.\n\nThe goodness of governing the world\nAll stems from the goodness of nurturing the body.\nThus, the Sage’s nurturing of the body,\nThough **non-action**, is never without governance.\n\nNames, profits, and desires all vanish—\nOnly guarding the **Middle** to empty the heart.\nNames, profits, and desires all purified—\nOnly cultivating **qi** to fill the belly.\nMoreover, the will gentle and yielding—\nUsing weakness as function;\nThe bones firm and strong—\nUsing strength as essence.\nMaking the body serene and unadorned,\nIn harmony with the world in **non-doing**.\nThus the people also remain in **ignorance and desirelessness**,\nEmbracing their **original simplicity**,\nSo that even the wise of the world cannot act,\nNor dare to act.\n\nThus is the **Sage’s** governance of **non-action**.\n\n**Chapter Four**\n(*River Above Master’s annotation* originally titled *Chapter on the Rootless*)\n\n**Chapter Five**\n(*The Way is void yet its use is inexhaustible.\nDeep and vast, it seems the origin of all things.\nBlunt its sharpness, unravel its tangles,\nDull its brilliance, harmonize with the dust.\nMysterious! As if it exists—\nI know not whose child it is, yet it precedes the Sovereign-on-High.*)\n\nThe Sage’s **non-action** lies entirely in emptiness and its use.\n**Void** is **emptiness**.\nThe Way employs emptiness in its use—\nIts measure encompasses heaven and earth, yet never seems full;\nDeep and vast, like the ancestral root of all things.\nIt blunts the world’s sharpness without harm,\nUnravels its entanglements without toil—\nFor emptiness consumes sharpness and confusion.\nIt harmonizes with the world’s brilliance without obscuring,\nMerges with its dust without defilement—\nFor emptiness forgets brilliance and dust.\nOnly its **void** essence remains,\nEver congealed in **mysterious** stillness—\nAs if it exists, yet truly stores nothing.\nAsk who its child is, and you know its child—\nIts name precedes the Sovereign-on-High?\nTruly the **beginning without beginning**,\nThe **first of the Primordial**,\nThe **Heaven-before-Heaven**.\n\n**Chapter Six**\n(*Heaven and Earth are not kind;\nThey treat all things as fodder for dogs.*)\n\nHeaven and Earth act without benevolence,\nYet fulfill all things’ needs.\nEach thing takes what it requires,\nUses what it must.\nNot-kindness is the utmost kindness—\nIf benevolence were required for their nurturing,\nThen each thing would demand Heaven and Earth’s favor for birth,\nA task impossible to exhaust.\nOnly by not providing fodder for beasts\nDo beasts eat fodder.\nOnly by not feeding men their dogs\nDo men feed their dogs.\nThus benevolence’s scope grows ever vast.\nSpeaking of fodder and dogs,\nOne may extend it to fruits, vegetables, chickens, and swine.\n\n(*The Sage is not kind;\nHe treats the people as fodder for dogs.*)\n\nThe Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth’s **virtue**,\nLetting the people each nurture themselves,\nEach fulfill their own needs—\nThis is **non-action** achieving completion.\n\n(*Between Heaven and Earth—\nIs it not like a bellows?*\nEmpty yet unbroken,\nMoving yet ever producing.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—\nBetter to guard the **Middle**.*)\n\nHeaven, Earth, and the Sage\nDo not contrive food and use for all things and people—\nYet all things and people naturally obtain their sustenance,\nThrough the **void** and **Middle**’s encompassing capacity.\nHeaven and Earth divide into two realms,\nBetween which lies an empty, boundless space—\nLike the bellows’ unfathomable depth,\nThe flute’s resonant passage.\n**Qi** flows in and out, naturally without effort—\nThus emptiness can contain,\nUnbroken by the myriad things.\nIts capacity is boundless,\nMoving yet silently functioning,\nEver expanding its full measure—\nIts essence is inexhaustible.\nHeaven and Earth do not speak,\nNor does the Sage.\nIf they spoke much,\nTheir words would be numbered,\nAnd numbers could be exhausted—\nThus better to guard the **Middle**.\n\n**Chapter Seven**\n(*The **Valley Spirit** does not die—\nThis is called the **Mysterious Female**.\nThe **Mysterious Female’s** gate—\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nEndless, as if it exists—\nUsing it brings no toil.*)\n\nThe Sage guards the **Middle** to nurture the body,\nFor the **Valley Spirit** is the **original nature**.\n**Valley** signifies **emptiness**,\n**Spirit** signifies **numen**—\nThe nature, being empty and numinous, does not perish.\nNot perishing is **not-death**.\nWhy call the **Valley Spirit** the **Mysterious Female**?\n**Mysterious** is Heaven,\n**Female** is Earth.\nHeaven and Earth unite to form the **Mysterious Female**,\nBetween them lies an empty, boundless space.\nThe Confucian school names it **Hidden and Subtle**—\nWithin lies a realm unseen and unheard.\nThe Buddhist school names it **That**—\nWithin lies a truth beyond good and evil.\nThe Sage nurtures the body by borrowing the **Mysterious Female’s** empty void\nTo cultivate the **Valley Spirit’s** empty numen—\nThus the **Valley Spirit** names the **Mysterious Female**,\nA naming drawn from its function.\nOne **Mysterious**, one **Female**—\nOne **Heaven**, one **Earth**.\nConfucius said: *Is not Heaven-Earth the gateway of the **Changing**?*\n*The **Paramount Concordance** says: “Heaven-Earth are the **Changing’s** threshold.”*\nThe **Two Cavities Method**—where golden **qi** converges—\nThis is the **Mysterious Female’s** gate.\nYin and Yang circulate within,\nKan and Li copulate there.\nThe chamber where man and woman merge their essence,\nWhere sun and moon exchange their light—\nThe Sage reverses this,\nMaking it the **Gate of Life**.\nThe common man follows it naturally,\nMaking it the **Door of Death**.\nEarth-Heaven’s harmonious union\nEncompasses nothing else.\nThus it is also called the **root of Heaven and Earth**—\nThe root where Heaven and Earth mutually conceal themselves.\nThe root of Heaven and Earth\nIs the place to return to the origin,\nTo refine **qi** and transform **spirit**.\nEndless, as if it exists—\nThis is nurturing the **Valley Spirit**, naturally **embryonic breathing**.\nUsing it brings no toil—\nThis is the **outer furnace’s** natural correspondence,\nThe **symbolic fire** without effort.\n**Not toil** means **not to labor**.\n\n**Chapter Eight**\n(*Heaven is long, Earth is durable.\nWhy can Heaven and Earth endure so long?\nBecause they do not seek to live for themselves,\nThus they attain eternal life.\nTherefore the Sage puts his body last,\nYet his body is first;\nSets his body outside,\nYet his body is preserved.\nIs this not because he has no selfishness?\nThus he fulfills his selfishness.*)\n\n---\n*(Note: The final chapter’s original text was incomplete in the provided excerpt. The translation ends where the text concludes.)*\n\n「The **Dao/Way** of eternal life is that Heaven is long and Earth is durable.\nYet the reason Heaven and Earth can endure so long is that they remain in stillness and focus while moving and opening, in contraction and expansion, giving birth to all things broadly and widely, nurturing without selfishness, and thus attain this eternal life.\nIf Heaven and Earth were to selfishly possess their own **virtue/power**, then the fate of all things would be obstructed, and Heaven and Earth would harm their own harmony.\nIf the nature of things were not upright, Heaven and Earth would destroy them.\nThe injury and ruin of all things are the injury and ruin of Heaven and Earth.\nOnly by not selfishly possessing their own **virtue/power** and instead using it for all beings’ lives,\ndo all beings’ ceaseless generation become the eternal life of Heaven and Earth—\nthus they attain eternal life.\nThe Sage follows the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth.\nTherefore, the Sage nurtures his body with gentleness and frailty,\nappearing to put his body last to seek life.\nYet gradually filling and satisfying,\nhe truly preserves his body first to attain life.\nGuarding the center and controlling the outer,\nhe seems to set his life outside, as if without life.\nYet by first forgetting and then remembering,\nhe preserves his body to have life.\nBut all these are ways of not selfishly possessing his **Dao/Way**,\nfor the Sage is serene and tranquil,\nand the people’s nature is also pure and virtuous.\nThe Sage reaches his natural lifespan,\nand the people’s lives are also long and venerable.\nThe **Great Dao/Way** is without selfishness,\nyet to this extent, the Sage also appears to selfishly possess his own life.\nWithout selfishness, yet fulfilling it—\nthis is the utmost.\n\n**Chapter Eight**\n(*River Master’s commentary titles this the \"Chapter of Concealing Light,\" Peng’s version the

toward it.\nIn comparison, water flows downward yet people still have high and low,\nso it is even more divine in the **Dao/Way** and refined beyond water.\n\n**Chapter Nine**\n(*River Master’s commentary titles this the \"Chapter of Leveling the Uneven,\" Peng’s version the \"Chapter of Holding Fullness.\")\n\n**Holding and filling to excess, unaware of its fullness;\nGrasping and sharpening to extremity, cannot be long preserved.**\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them;\nWealth and honor with arrogance, only bring self-inflicted ruin.\n\n**Holding:** obtaining also.」\n\n「**Grasping:** probing also.\n\nOnce a person has obtained its **qi**, yet still harbors the thought of further excess,\nthis marks the beginning of inviting deficiency—\nthus, it is better to stop at its fullness.\n\nWhen a person is probed for its treasures,\nand suddenly feels the urge for sharpness and brilliance,\nthis is surely a sign of inevitable decline—\nthus, it cannot be long preserved.\n\nIf one does not stop when it is best to stop,\nit will be like gold and jade filling the hall,\nyet none can guard them.\n\nIf one does not preserve when it should be preserved,\nit will be like wealth and honor with arrogance,\nself-inflicting ruin.\n\nSuch is the **Dao/Way** of humanity.\n\n**When achievements are complete, name is fulfilled, and one withdraws—\nthis is the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.**\n\nMoreover, let us speak of the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.\nHeaven does not speak of achievements and name,\nbut takes nurturing and flourishing, growth and fulfillment,\nas its achievements and name.\n\nWhen things are fully grown and their function complete,\nthe seasons bring their renown—\nHeaven and Earth thus withdraw and shift.\n\nIt hides itself in winter’s order,\nto nurture the **yang** and the living.\n\nHow then might one observe the **Dao/Way** of Heaven?\n\n**Chapter Ten**\n(*He’s version titled \"Chapter of Capability,\" Peng’s version \"Chapter of Mysterious Virtue/Power.\")\n\n**To bear the vital essence and embrace unity,\ncan one truly remain unseparated?**\n\n**To focus the **qi** and attain softness,\ncan one be like an infant?**\n\n**To

titled \"Chapter of Use,\" Peng’s version \"Chapter of Beneficial Use.\")\n\n**Camp:** as in *camp* and *wei* (defensive and circulatory) of *camp-wei*.\n*Wei* belongs to yang, while *camp* belongs to yin.\n**Camp-po:** that is, the yin soul.\nSome say: *Camp* is *po*.\nTo take *camp* as *po* is a misinterpretation.\nOne must know that when speaking of the yin *po*, the yang soul is contained within it.\nOn the fifteenth of the eighth month, the soul fully enters the lunar *po*, and the moon becomes full, attaining pure *Gàn* (metallic yang).\nThe Sage, at this time, governs the *Héché* (river vehicle) to bear it,\nand thus *Gàn*’s gold is secured—\nas the Classic says: *\"Obtain the One, and all things are complete.\"*\nHaving obtained the One,\none must not lose the One.\nThe Sage bears the *po* and returns,\nembraces the One and dwells within,\nand thus the earthly *po* seizes *Zhūyōng* (cinnabar).\nHence, can one truly remain unseparated?\n\nIn the tenth month, warmth nurtures internally—\nthe inner fire is naturally kindled.\nWarmth *qi* abides constantly,\nand the fetus grows like an infant.\nThe Sage focuses *qi* to attain softness—\nthis is the inner fire.\nHence, can one be like nurturing an infant?\n\n**Xuan-lan:** inner observation.\nTo purify and remove **Xuan-lan** is to be serene and observe inwardly.\nSerene and inward observation—\nthe heart bears no blemish or burden,\nas in:\n*\"To observe emptiness is emptiness,\nemptiness has nothing to empty.\nWhat is emptied has nothing,\nand nothingness is without nothing.\nWithout nothingness, it is tranquil and ever still.\"*\n\nTo love the people is to settle them,\nto govern the realm is to enrich it.\nWhen the people are settled and the realm is rich,\none may then practice the politics of *wuwei* (non-action).\nTo govern the body, *jing* (essence) and *dìng* (stability) bring peace to the people,\n*qiān* (lead) sufficiency brings wealth to the realm.\nRefining oneself achieves *jing* and *dìng*,\nreturning the elixir achieves *qiān* sufficiency.\nRefinement and elixir—\nonly then can one practice the Dao of embracing the One and *wuwei*.\n\nTo govern the body, guarding *cí* (feminine) is the practice,\nnourishing the spirit and fetus cannot but guard *cí*.\nWhen the Heavenly Gate bursts open,\nthe yang spirit enters and exits freely,\nopening and closing as it will—\ncan one then be free from the toil of guarding *cí*?\n\nTo govern the body, knowledge is a disturbance.\nWhen the Sage’s body is perfected,\nthe spirit of knowledge is transformed—\nequally enlightened, equally awakened.\nBright and clear in all directions,\nunobstructed—\ncan one then be without knowledge?\n\nMoreover, there is the merit of bearing sons and grandsons,\nexchanging cauldrons and dividing the fetus.\nWith the capacity to accumulate virtue and blessings,\none establishes merit to benefit the world.\nYet though one gives birth and does not possess the birth,\nit is like powdered void.\nThough one acts and does not rely upon it,\nit is boundless compassion.\nThe heart of protecting the realm and aiding the people\nendures for countless eons,\nyet without boasting as the sovereign of heaven.\nThis is truly called **Mysterious Virtue/Power**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\n(*He’s version titled \"Chapter of No-Use,\" Peng’s version \"Chapter of Beneficial Use.\")\n\n**Thirty spokes converge at one hub;\nit is their emptiness that gives the chariot its use.\nClay is shaped into vessels;\nit is their emptiness that gives the vessel its use.\nDoors and

\"Chapter of Restraint of Desires,\" Peng’s version \"Chapter of the Abdomen.\")\n\nThirty-six spokes, modeling the revolutions of sun and moon,\nYet the hub stands at the chariot’s center, where all axles pass.\nEmpty within, converging without—\nThough the hub itself is void, it is the chariot’s true function.\n\n*Cao* is the blending of water and earth;\n*Zhi* is the clay, the artisan’s work—brick and tile.\nBefore shaping, there is no vessel;\nYet once molded and fired, its use is complete.\n\nDoors and windows bring light to the hall—\nBefore their carving, the hall seems nonexistent.\nOnce adorned, its purpose is fulfilled.\n\nThus, what is *has* is for advantage,\nBut what is *void* is for use.\nAll that exists arises from the void—\nThis is their general principle.\n\n---\n\n**Five colors** blind the eyes;\n**Five tones** deafen the ears;\n**Five flavors** dull the palate;\n**Hunting and galloping** drive the mind to madness;\n**Rare treasures** entangle the steps.\n\nTherefore, the Sage values the **abdomen** over the eyes,\nAnd discards the former to embrace the latter.\n\n*Shuang*: loss.\n\nThe maddened: the unrestrained.\n\nRare treasures and delights—\nAll men covet them.\nThus, when treasures cling to one’s person,\nThey hinder movement as well.\nThe five—colors, sounds, flavors, hunts, and goods—\nHarm men thus.\nTherefore, the Sage holds them cheap,\nGuarding inner wealth while scornful of externals,\nThus able to discard the former and embrace the latter.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\n*(River Upper Master’s annotation: \"Chapter on Disdaining Shame\"; Peng’s version: \"Chapter on Favor and Nobility\")*\n\n**Favor and shame, like sudden alarm;\nNobility and great calamity, like the body itself.**\n\nIf favor comes as alarm,\nThen one must hide precious jade deep within.\nIf shame comes as alarm,\nThen one must firmly establish roots.\n\nThis is the emblem of a hidden heart and resolute will.\n\nIf nobility is like the body,\nThen one must rejoice in the Dao and rest in honor;\nIf calamity is like the body,\nThen one must harmonize brilliance and spread slander.\n\nThis is the method of embracing the Primordial and preserving the True.\n\n**What is meant by \"favor and shame, like sudden alarm\"?**\n*(Wang Bi and other versions read: \"Favor is low\")*\nTo gain it as alarm,\nTo lose it as alarm—\nThis is called \"favor and shame, like sudden alarm.\"\n\nFavor as low—\nLike saying: honor and favor are unstable,\nEver shifting downward,\nThus gains and losses cannot be relied upon.\n\nTo gain it as alarm,\nTo lose it as alarm—\nSometimes gaining, sometimes losing,\nEver vigilant and striving with the times—\nThis is what is meant by \"favor and shame, like sudden alarm.\"\n\n**What is meant by \"nobility and great calamity, like the body itself\"?**\nThe reason I have great calamity\nIs that I have this body.\n\n「When I have no body,\nWhat calamity shall I have?\n\nThus, he who values his body as the foundation for the world\nCan entrust himself to the world;\nHe who cherishes his body as the world’s reliance\nCan commit himself to the world’s service.\n\nThis passage elucidates the **nobility of calamity**—\nYet it first clarifies that calamity exists\nBecause one must return to the absence of calamity.\n\nBut the cause of great calamity\nLies in the present form of the fleshly body,\nSo calamity can be imposed upon it.\n\nOnce the shell is shed and the **True Qi** preserved,\nCalamity cannot be imposed upon it.\n\nOr, if one retains his form and dwells in the world,\nHis **True Qi** contained within,\nConcealing his brilliance and obscuring his traces—\nWhat calamity could then bend him?\n\nThus, when one holds his body in esteem,\nTreating it as the world’s vessel of life,\nYet does not dare to slight his precious form—\nThen he can entrust his body to the world.\nThis is how the **Yellow Stone Master** instructed **Zifang**.\n\nWhen one safeguards his body,\nTreating it as the world’s support and trust,\nYet does not dare to reveal his matchless talents—\nThen he can commit his body to the world’s service.\nThis is how **Zhang Jiuling** admonished **Yehou**.\n\nHe who well preserves his body\nIs one who well governs his own life.\nHe who well governs his own life\nIs one who well governs the world.\n\nConfucius said:\n*The dragon and serpent’s dormancy*\nIs to preserve their bodies.\n*To utilize and secure one’s dwelling*\nIs to exalt **Virtue/Power**.\nThe **noble man** keeps his **treasures** within his body,\nWaiting for the time to act—\nWhat then is

(能常应).\n**The tranquil** (寂然),\nFurther **becomes profound** (湛然).\nThus **knowing constancy** is **clarity** (明).\n\n**Common folk**, unaware of the **true constancy’s Dao/Way** (真常之道)\nLies in

(其次者，道之次也).\nThe **Most High Dao** achieves without action, governs without words.\nThe **second level** cannot achieve without action, cannot govern without words,\nSo they **revere and praise with affection** (亲爱而奖誉之), to **promote transformation** (以兴化焉).\n**Again next**, unable to promote transformation through affectionate praise,\nThey must **enforce with laws and commands, making them fear and submit** (则必以法令畏之而服之焉).\n**Again next**, unable to make them submit through fear of laws,\nThey must **use cleverness to dominate and subdue** (则必以智巧侮之而驭之焉).\nWhen **Dao** descends to **cleverness**, the **wind grows low** (风斯下矣),\nAnd the rest is unworthy of observation (其余不足观也已).\n\nThus, **trust is again spoken of at the root** (故复言根心之信).\nIf the **ruler values trust**, then the

(下即有不信者焉).\nAnd the Sage **must rely on trust for governance** (而圣人必以信为治理也).\n\n**Precious words** (贵言): **speak with caution** (慎言).\nWhen the ruler **personally practices genuine governance** (躬行实政),\n**Leisurely and inspiring trust** (优游感孚),\nWithout issuing commands, the people **submit willingly** (不诰令而民情服),\nThus **their words must be spoken with utmost care** (故必谨慎其令言).\nWhen

reverence,\nwhere response flows naturally—\nacting without action,\nyet something is accomplished.\n\nAgain, the next level governs through laws and merit.\nThen, through wisdom and cunning—\nthe **arts of strategy**—\nwhere action brings results.\n\nBut the most profound truth is **trust**,\nfor **trust belongs to the earth**,\nand the **elixir’s essence**, from beginning to end,\nfinds its

as losing the **primordial unity** of the body\nleads to the **restorative work** of recovery.\n\nUsing **clarity and strategy** to probe deeper\nonly makes the people’s true feelings more

learning?\nThus it is said:\n*\"Do not fear what they fear.\"*\n\n---\n**Ah, vast and boundless!**\nThe masses rejoice, rejoicing,\nas if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,\nas if ascending the Spring Platform.\nI alone am tranquil, with no trace yet shown—\nlike an infant before it learns to speak.\n*Buying, buying*—\nas if drifting without destination.\nThe masses all have abundance,\nwhile I alone seem forsaken.\nAh, my heart is that of a simpleton!\n*Dull, dull*—\nwhile the vulgar are bright and clear,\nI alone am dim and murky.\n*Dull, dull*—\nlike the obscurity of night,\nsilent, as if without end.\nThe masses all have purpose,\nwhile I alone am stubborn and crude.\nI alone differ from others,\nyet I alone cherish the **Mother** of the **Dao**.\n\nThe **Dao** before Heaven unfolds,\nlike the pristine chaos before creation—\neffortless yet complete,\nsilent yet governing.\nThus the masses attain the pure transformation,\nrejoicing and content in harmony.\nThey share its virtue,\nas if feasting on the grandest sacrifice.\nThey dwell together in its realm,\nas if ascending the Spring Platform.\nThough this may be the custom of Hua Xu,\nnothing surpasses it.\n\nThe Sage says:\nI alone am serene and still,\nremote and unmarked,\nlike an infant before it learns to speak.\n*Buying, buying*—\nto ride along with the **Dao**,\nthus it is called *buying, buying*.\nAscending and descending, moving within—\nendless, as if without support.\nThus the masses all have excess to seek,\nwhile I alone stand apart,\nas if abandoned by the world.\nThen the masses are all wise,\nwhile I alone seem foolish—\nfor great skill appears as clumsiness.\n\n*Dull, dull*—\nlike the darkness of Heaven and Earth,\n*flitting*—\nas if the comings and goings have no fixed path.\nFrom this, it is seen:\nthe masses all have purpose,\nwhile I alone am confused and dim,\nfloating like a fool, crude and unadorned.\nPeople do not follow me,\nand I do not follow them.\nOne grain of **yang dan**,\ncalled the **Mother Qi**—\nI alone seek and consume it\nto attain longevity.\nThus, the masses do not equal the Sage,\njust as ‘yes’ and ‘nodding’ differ,\nor good and evil.\nIs this not why the Sage alone proclaims the **Abandonment of Learning**?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two**\n*\"The vastness of virtue’s container\nfollows only the **Dao**.\nThe **Dao** as a thing—\nonly vague, only hazy.\nHazy and vague—\nyet within it, there are forms.\nVague and hazy—\nyet within it, there is substance.\nDeep and dark—\nyet within it, there is essence.\nIts essence is most true—\nwithin it, there is veracity.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nits name does not fade,\nto observe the myriad things.\nHow do I know the myriad things are thus?\nBecause of this.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two (On Virtue’s Container)**\n\n**孔 (Kǒng):** *emptiness, vastness.*\nThe utmost emptiness, the utmost vastness—\nits virtue and vessel can contain wondrous things,\nthus the **Dao** enters through this.\n\nThe **Dao** as a thing—\nhazy and vague, without fixed form.\nIn terms of *separating essence*, it originally has no image.\nNow vague, now hazy—\nwhat has no form seems to have form.\nNow hazy, now vague—\nwhat has no substance already has substance.\n\nSome say *\"hazy and vague\"* rhymes with *image*,\n*\"vague and hazy\"* rhymes with *substance*.\nYet they do not know the Sage’s words invert letters,\nhiding within them the inversion of the **Dao**’s law.\n\n*\"Hazy and vague\"*—this is the original image of essence.\n*\"Vague and hazy\"*—this is the substance nurtured by essence,\nas male beneath female, their union forming *jing*—\none thing, yet truly two.\n\nThus, there is form in the first phrase,\nsubstance in the second,\nand *jing* in the third.\nThe sentence structure itself embodies the **Dao**’s inversion.\n\nFor *jing* is the fire of essence descending,\nilluminating and responding to form—\nonly then does it reveal the *Kàn* (abyss) emotions,\nyet it remains subtly profound, beyond measure—\nhence *\"deep and dark.\"*\n\nThe *jing* of depth and darkness—\nthis is the true *jing*.\nTo obtain true *jing*,\none must know true *xin* (faith).\nThus, within it lies faith—\nvast as tides rising,\nmelted as ice thawing.\n\nThe cultivator, at this moment,\nwaits for faith’s first arrival—\nwhen it is clearly *jing*, then seize it, suppress it.\nTiming must be precise—\nthen the *Jīnxiān* (Golden Immortal) fate is yours.\n\nIt is called *true gold*,\n*Chǒujīng* (First Scripture),\n*true water*,\n*shénshuǐ* (Divine Water),\n*true lead*,\n*qiānqì* (Lead Qi),\n*Báihǔ* (White Tiger),\n*hǔqì* (Tiger Qi)—\nyet all refer to true *jing*.\n\nThus, from ancient times to now,\nthis true *jing*’s name remains in all scriptures.\nBy observing one true thing,\none perceives the principle of all things—\nnone escape this original *qi*.\n\n*\"To observe the myriad things\"*—\nthis is to examine their beginnings.\nHence it is said:\n*\"How do I know the myriad things are thus?\nBecause of this.\"*\n\n**Supplementary Note:**\nWithin this chapter, four references to *\"among\"* (*kǒng*)

confused\"*—\ngreed blinds the mind.\n\nThese are the ancient words of the *Tàishàng* (Supreme One) before,\nteaching the essential **Dao** of self-cultivation.\nThus, the Sage governs the world\nby embracing *oneness* as the model for all under heaven.\n\nTo embrace *oneness* is:\nnot self-illuminating,\nnot self-righteous,\nnot self-praising,\nnot self-glorifying.\n\n*(Wang’s annotation: These four lines correspond to \"what is bent becomes whole,\"*\n*yet this interpretation is mistaken—*\n*for \"hence bright,\" \"hence manifest,\" \"hence enduring,\" \"hence meritorious\"*\n*each clarify their respective lines above.)*\n\nSomeone asks:\n*\"Why does the ancient text repeat ‘what is bent becomes whole’?\"*\nI say:\nThis is the *Tàishàng* quoting ancient words of self-cultivation\nto introduce the principle of all under heaven.\nThus it says: *\"Was not this a mere empty phrase?\"*\nIf one reverently guards this sincerity,\nthen all under heaven will surely return to this

downpours that do not last the day—\nthough even the heavens and earth produce them,\nthey too cannot endure long.\nHow much less so for mortals?\n\nThus, all who follow the **Dao**’s path—\ncultivating virtue and walking the **Dao**—\nmust do so naturally,\nonly then can they be one with virtue and the **Dao**.\n\nLoss is also *wuwei*.\nTo act without *wuwei* is to invite the very

of one’s own virtue* (*kuà*): to hasten, to rush forward.\"\nTo **aspire** (*qí*) is to lift one’s head upward, unable to stand long.\nTo **hasten** is to weary one’s feet, unable to walk far.\nThose who see only themselves, insist on their own rightness,\npraise themselves, or vaunt their own virtue—\nall are those who fail to embrace this natural effortlessness,\nand thus will never accomplish anything.\n\nThis is likened to the **Dao**:\n‘Excessive intake and superfluous actions.’\nSome may loathe this,\nso those who follow the **Dao** do not dwell there.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 25**\n*\"Boasting of one’s own virtue* (*kuà*): to hasten, to rush forward.\"\n\nThere is a **formless** and **mixed** entity (*hùnchéng*),\nborn before Heaven and Earth.\nSilent and vast (*jì xiāo liáo*),\nit stands alone yet never alters,\ncirculates endlessly yet never falters,\nand may be called the **Mother of all things**.\n\nI do not know its name,\nso I call it **\"Dao\"** (*dào*).\nI force a name upon it and call it **\"Great\"** (*dà*).\nGreat is **passing** (*shì*),\npassing is **distant** (*yuǎn*),\ndistant is **returning** (*fǎn*).\nThus the **Dao** is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nand the Sovereign (*wáng*) is also Great.\nWithin the realm (*yù*), there are four Great Ones,\nand the Sovereign occupies one of them.\n\nHumans follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the **Dao**,\nand the **Dao** follows **Nature**.\n\nThe **Mother of all things** (*mǔqì*)\nis the **original** and **formless** *qi* (*hóngméng shǐqì, hùnhùn wúmíng*).\nThe **formless** is that which was born before Heaven and Earth.\nSilent (*jì*): clear (*qīng*).\nVast (*liáo*): empty (*xū*).\nStanding alone in the realm of clarity and emptiness,\nyet never changing its true and constant nature—\nthis is none other than the **formless** and **mixed**.\n\nOne entity flowing through all things,\ncompleting them yet never failing—\nthis is what may be called the **Mother of all things**.\n\nSince the beginning of the **Dao** (*dào zǔ*) and the opening of the cosmos,\nthe **Mother** *qi* has been known to exist before the **Hun** (*hùndùn*).\nIt gives birth to Heaven, Earth, humans, and all things,\nnurturing them within its embrace.\nWhen asked its name,\nI did not know it,\nso I first called it **\"Dao\"** (*dào*).\n**Dao** is composed of the radicals *shǒu* (首) and *chū* (辶),\nindicating that which moves before Heaven and Earth to give birth.\nI then forced a name upon it and called it **\"Great\"** (*dà*).\n**Great** is composed of the radicals *yī* (一) and *rén* (人),\nindicating that which precedes all things and emerges first.\nThus, through all ages,\nit is called the **Great Dao** (*Dàdào*).\n\nThe **Great** is limitless in its power,\nruling above *Qián* (乾) and below *Kūn* (坤).\n**Passing** (*shì*), it departs from you.\n**Distant** (*yuǎn*), it reaches everywhere—\neven to the North *Kǎn* (坎) and West *Duì* (兑).\nThis **Dao** is boundless,\nand when it reaches its utmost, it returns.\n\nIt may emerge in *Zhèn* (震),\nalign in *Sūn* (巽),\nmanifest in *Lí* (离),\nand complete in *Gèn* (艮).\nGreat indeed!\nThe **Dao**, Heaven, Earth, and the Sovereign\nare the four Great Ones within the realm.\n\nWithout the **Dao**, one cannot know Heaven—\nHeaven is Great.\nWithout Heaven, there is no covering of Earth—\nEarth is Great.\nWithout Earth, there is no bearing of the Sovereign—\nthe Sovereign is also Great.\nThe Sovereign resides among them,\nas the first among all people.\nThe Sovereign is the master of the people,\nnever leaving humanity.\nHumans dwell upon Earth,\nso they follow Earth.\nEarth lies beneath Heaven,\nso it follows Heaven.\nHeaven is within the **Dao**,\nso it follows the **Dao**.\nThe **Dao** is most wondrous in its **Natural** state,\nso it follows **Nature**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 26**\nHeavy (*zhòng*) is the **root of lightness** (*qīng*),\nstill (*jìng*) is the **master of agitation** (*zào*).\nThus the **virtuous** (*jūnzǐ*) walks through the day\nwithout straying from the balance of **lightness** and **heaviness**.\n\nThough surrounded by splendor and spectacle (*róngguān yànchǔ*),\nthey dwell in **transcendent** ease (*chāorán*).\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots (*wànshèng zhǔ*)\nlighten themselves against the world (*shēn qīng tiānxià*)?\nTo **lighten** is to lose one’s ministers,\nto **agitate** is to lose one’s **virtue**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 27**\n\nHeaviness is water;\nlightness is fire.\nWater gives birth to fire within itself,\nso heaviness is the **root of lightness**.\n\nStillness is **calm abiding** (*dìng*);\nagitation is **wisdom** (*huì*).\nCalm abiding gives rise to wisdom within itself,\nso stillness is the **master of agitation**.\n\nObserve the **virtuous** (*jūnzǐ*) whose talent and **virtue** are both profound:\nthey move through the day without straying from the balance of **lightness** and **heaviness**,\nseeking to apply themselves with **lightness** and ease.\nThough surrounded by splendor and spectacle (*róngguān yànchǔ*),\nthey dwell in **transcendent** ease (*chāorán*),\nundisturbed by the bustle of the world.\n\nYet how can the sovereign of the **Red Palace** (*Zhàngōng zhǔ*),\none held in such esteem as the ruler of ten thousand chariots (*wànshèng zhǔ*),\nsuddenly abandon this principle and forget it?\nThey neither **uphold** heaviness to nurture lightness,\nnor **preserve** stillness to govern agitation.\n\nI fear that if they lean entirely toward **lightness**,\nthey will lose the **true water**—the genuine talent—\nand fire will have no **root**.\nFire arises from water,\nwater serves as fire’s **minister** (*chén*),\nhence it is called **minister**.\n\nIf they lean entirely toward **agitation**,\nthey will lose the **true stillness**—the genuine **calm abiding** (*dìng*)—\nand wisdom will have no **master**.\nWisdom emerges from **calm abiding**,\nstillness serves as wisdom’s **master** (*jūn*),\nhence it is called **master**.\n\nThe **virtuous** act leaves no trace,\nthe **virtuous** word no flaw or censure,\nthe **virtuous** plan requires no calculations or schemes,\nthe **virtuous** closure needs no locks or keys yet cannot be opened,\nthe **virtuous** binding needs no cords or constraints yet cannot be undone.\n\nTherefore, the Sage always **upholds** the **virtue** of saving others,\nand thus never abandons anyone.\nAlways **upholds** the **virtue** of saving things,\nand thus never abandons anything.\nThis is called **following the bright** (*xí míng*).\n\nHence, the **virtuous** person is the teacher of the **non-virtuous**,\nwhile the **non-virtuous** person is the **resource** (*zī*) of the **virtuous**.\nIf one does not **honor** their teacher,\nnor **cherish** their **resource**,\neven if their wisdom is vast, they will be deeply **bewildered** (*dà mí*),\nand this is called **the essence of subtlety** (*yào miào*).\n\nThe act that leaves no trace is the **natural** process of the **celestial chariot** (*hé chē*),\nif it is forced, then one **conceives** and **manipulates** it.\n\nThe word that has no flaw is the **natural** **inheritance** (*zǔ shù*),\nif it is forced, then one **contradicts** and **distorts** the **principles**.\n\nThe plan that requires no calculations is the **natural** **firing time** (*huǒ hòu*),\nif calculations are used, then one becomes **stuck** in **divination lines** (*yáo zé*).\n\nThe closure that cannot be opened is the **natural** **inner prohibition** (*nèi jìn*),\nif it can be opened, then one merely **shuts** the ears and eyes.\n\nThe binding that cannot be undone is the **natural** **congealing** (*níng jù*),\nif it can be undone, then one **forcibly** **joins** it.\n\nTherefore, the Sage **preserves** the **natural** **virtue** of the **true water**—the genuine talent—\nand **establishes** both self and others,\nso all may be **relied upon** (*chóng zhòng*).\nHe **perfects** both self and things,\nso all may be **observed** (*guān*).\n\nThe one who **inherits enlightenment** does so by awakening those who are yet unaware—\nthe mind **transmits** and **alerts** to awakening.\nThis is called **inheriting enlightenment**.\n\nThus, the virtuous **realize** the **illuminated virtue** (*míngdé*),\nand the unvirtuous, though drawn to it, also **realize** the **illuminated virtue**.\nThe unvirtuous do not **self-reflect**,\nbut the virtuous, seeing unvirtue, **can** **self-reflect**.\nThey **turn to teach** one another, **turn to aid** one another.\nIf they do not **aid** or **teach** one another,\nwhat could be more **precious** or **lovable**?\nThen one **fabricates cleverness**—\nthough wise, one is **greatly deluded**.\n\nThe **refinement of the self**’s **subtle essence** lies in nothing else.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Eighth** (*River Master’s version: \"Return to Simplicity\"; Peng’s version: \"Constant Virtue\"*)\n\n*\"Know its masculine, preserve its feminine—\nthis is the **creek** of the world.\nAs the **creek** of the

**uphold**.\n\n**First:** *Masculine application, feminine transformation.*\n*The Parametric Concordance* says:\n*\"The masculine yang spreads the dark transformation,\nthe feminine yin governs the yellow refinement.\"*\nThis is it.\n**Knowing** this allows one to **apply** and **act**,\n**preserving** this allows one to **transform** and **nurture**.\nWhen masculine and feminine **interact harmoniously**,\nthe metal **conceals** within the water,\nand the water **revolves**, giving birth to its metal.\nWhen the metal *qi* is sufficient, the **tide arrives**—\nits force is like the **creek’s flow**.\nFlowing **backward**, ascending **against the current**,\nthis is the **creek** of the world’s **irrigation**.\n\nYet though it is the **creek** of irrigation,\nwhen the **yang fire advances** and the **yin symbol** descends,\n**constant virtue**—returning to root, fulfilling mandate—\ncannot depart.\nThus it returns to the **earthen pot**,\nto **nourish** the **fetal infant**.\n\n**Second:** *Masculine retreat, feminine concealment.*\n*The Awakening to Reality* says:\n*\"Within the masculine, the feminine conceives the sacred embryo.\"*\nIf we speak of **generative principle**,\nwhen yin is extreme, yang is born—\nthis is the feminine **conceiving** the masculine.\nIf we speak of **nurturing things**,\nwhen yang is extreme, yin is born—\nthis is the masculine **conceiving** the feminine.\nThe masculine **conceiving** the feminine—\nhaving **retreated** the masculine to **refine** the elixir,\none must further **conceal** the feminine to **warm** the elixir.\nIts force is like the **creek’s ravine**,\npouring downward from above,\nfalling into the **creek**—\nthus the **Way of preserving** the feminine\nis like the world’s **creeks and ravines**,\nwith **flow** and **return**.\nThis is the **true constant** **original virtue**,\nwhich cannot depart from its place.\nTo return to the **creek** is like returning to the **Yellow Court**.\nTo return to the **infant** is to **nurture** the **sacred embryo** in stillness.\n\n---\n*\"Know its white, preserve its black—\nthis is the **model** of the world.\nAs the **model** of the

workings**,\nfurther illustrating them through **color and form**.\nThe **white** is the **essence of metal**,\nthe **black** is the **foundation of water**.\nThe **essence of metal**—\nthe masculine yang **spreads** within the feminine and **gives birth**.\nBefore this essence exists,\nthe **Kun Mother’s** body is **void**,\nyet when she **interacts with** the **Qian Father’s** light,\nKun becomes **substantial** and forms **Kàn**.\nWith Kàn’s form already complete,\nthe moon **emits** the **Dui** phase—\nthis is called **metal within water**.\nThe **metal within water** truly **relies on** the **Kun Mother’s** nurturing to form,\nthus it is called **mother *qi***.\n*The Awakening to Reality* says:\n*\"Taking white from black is the elixir mother.\"*\nThe **mother *qi*** has a **white light**, called **yang light**.\nWhen the **yang light** appears,\none **circulates** one’s own **mercury** to **welcome** it—\nthis is the **\"two phases seeking medicine.\"**\nWhen they **correspond**, the **two eights** of the same kind\nare **seized** at once,\nrefined into **yang elixir**—the **elixir mother**.\nYet its **transformation** occurs externally,\nso the **elixir mother** is only **external medicine**.\nThe adept **uses external medicine** to **refine internal medicine**,\nwith **mother *qi*** **concealing** the **child *qi***.\nWithin the **elixir mother**, **yang lead** is again produced—\n**driving the River Vehicle** to **transport** it,\n**reversing** to the **original palace**,\n**concealing** in the **earthen pot**,\nthe **four phases harmonizing**, the **three clans** **interacting**—\nthis time, **joyful**, one attains **long life**.\n\nYet though the **method and function** are thus,\n**knowing white** must first **preserve black**,\n**preserving black** alone enables one to **know white**,\nand **knowing white** still requires **preserving black**.\nWithin this are **three layers of subtle application**,\nsufficient as the **model** for the world.\nIf one **follows** this and **acts** accordingly,\nthen **natural constant virtue** will not err.\nHaving not erred,\none may **return** and **verify** the **Ultimate Void**,\nand **refine the spirit** back to **emptiness**.\n\n**Knowing white** must **preserve black**—\nthe **yang enters** the **yin**.\n**Preserving black** enables one to **know white**—\nthe **yang is born** within the **yin**.\n**Knowing white** still requires **preserving black**—\nthe **spirit returns**, the **qi conceals**.\nThe **principles of heaven, earth, and ten thousand

‘auspicious’—\nyet ‘fine arms’ are called ‘not-auspicious’—\nhow can arms be deemed fine indeed?**\n\n**Arms** are the most harmful of things—\nnone despise them more than those who do.\nFor their schemes are numerous, their disturbances manifold;\nwould **those who follow the Dao** ever take pride in such **‘fine arms’**?\n\nThus, the **gentle person** in their daily life\nholds **auspicious left** dear—**left** is the seat of **good fortune**.\nBut when they wield **arms**, they hold **inauspicious right** dear—**right** is the seat of **calamity**.\nThis further shows that **arms** bring no **auspiciousness**.\n\nThough **arms** are not the **gentle person’s** instrument,\nthere are times when they must be used—\nto **relieve distress** is the highest purpose.\nDo not let **impulsive intent** and **excessive fervor** arise;\nlet banners hang limp, and **tranquility** prevail.\n\nEven if they **subdue the enemy** and return in triumph,\nthey never count **arms** as a **beautiful thing**.\nIf one does count **arms** as a **beautiful thing**,\ntheir heart must surely **delight in killing**.\n\nThose who **delight in killing**—\nhow can they be allowed to **fulfill their ambitions** in the realm?\nHow can they **exploit arms** across the world?\n\nObserving human affairs, I sigh deeply—\n**auspicious matters** are held to the **left**,\n**inauspicious matters** to the **right**.\n**Left** is **yang**—the principle of **life**—\n**right** is **yin**—the principle of **death**.\n\nThus, in the **military**, there is the **Supreme Commander** and the **Vanguard Commander**.\nThe **Vanguard Commander’s** troops\ndare not attack or kill without the **Supreme Commander’s** command.\nSeeing the **Vanguard Commander’s** **intent to preserve life**,\ntheir station is placed to the **left**.\nThe **Supreme Commander’s** **intent to kill**,\ntheir station is placed to the **right**.\nStationed to the **right**, they are bound by **funeral rites**—\nthe most **inauspicious** affair under heaven.\nThus, the **Supreme Commander** is placed under **funeral rites**,\nto warn them not to **kill lightly**.\n\nAlas!\nA **commander’s triumph** may cost **ten thousand bones**—\nthe sorrow is enough to **weep bitterly**.\n\nHence, when **killing is many**, it is met with **mourning tears**,\nand **victory in war** is treated as a **funeral matter**.\n\nThe **heart of the Sage** is the **heart of heaven and earth**—\nto **cherish life** above all.\n\n*In my humble view:*\nThe chapter’s **allegory** speaks of the **auspiciousness of the female

inexhaustible.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six (River Upper Master’s version: \"Subtle Clarity\")**\nWhen one seeks to gather, one must first let go.\nWhen one seeks to weaken, one must first

overcomes strength.\nA fish cannot escape the depths,\nnor can the state’s sharpest tools be openly displayed to the people.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven**\nThe Dao acts without action yet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings could preserve it,\nall things would transform of their own accord.\nWhen transformation occurs and they wish to act,\nI will subdue them with the nameless *Purity*.\n\nThe nameless *Purity* will also not wish to act.\nWithout desire, they will remain tranquil,\nand the world will naturally align.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight**\nThe *Great Virtue* does not claim virtue—thus it has virtue.\nThe *Lesser Virtue* does not lose virtue—thus it has no virtue.\nThe *Great Virtue* acts without action yet nothing is left undone.\nThe *Lesser Virtue* acts with action yet nothing is accomplished.\n\nThe *Great Benevolence* acts yet nothing is left undone,\nwhile the *Great Righteousness* acts yet something is accomplished.\nThe *Great Propriety* acts yet none respond—\nso it forces its way, only to meet resistance.\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows;\nwhen virtue is lost, benevolence follows;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;\nwhen righteousness is lost, propriety follows.\n\nFor propriety is the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nyet the beginning of chaos.\n*Preemptive Knowledge* is the adornment of the Dao,\nyet the origin of folly.\n\nTherefore, the noble person abides in the profound, not the superficial,\nin the genuine, not the adorned.\nThus, they discard the latter and embrace the former.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine**\nIn the past, those who attained the *One*:\nHeaven gained the *One* and became clear,\nEarth gained the *One* and became tranquil,\nThe spirit gained the *One* and became responsive,\nThe grain gained the *One* and became abundant,\nAll things gained the *One* and flourished,\nLords and kings gained the *One* to establish rectitude for the world.\n\nTheir attainment was through the *One*.\nIf Heaven lacked clarity, it would fear collapse.\nIf Earth lacked tranquility, it would fear upheaval.\nIf the spirit lacked responsiveness, it would fear stagnation.\nIf the grain lacked abundance, it would fear depletion.\nIf all things lacked flourishing, they would fear annihilation.\nIf lords and kings lacked rectitude, their noble status would fear decline.\n\nThus, nobility stems from humility,\nelevation from the foundation of lowliness.\nLords and kings call themselves \"lonely and bereft,\"\nnot seeking to be polished like jade or solitary like stone.\nThis is their grounding in humility, is it not?\n\nHence, they seek to avoid the clamor of many carriages,\nnot desiring the restless brilliance of jade\nor the detached rigidity of stone.\n\nThe *One* is the origin of all multiplicity.\n\nAt the very beginning of creation, it was called the *One*—before the *One* came into being, there was nothing to grasp; after the *One* emerged, distinctions were made. To attain this *One*, one must return to the primordial.\n\nBetween before and after, there is *qi* without substance, and substance without *qi* is but an empty form. The Five Phases regard water as the *One*, for this water is the utmost of virtue and the utmost of clarity, an unfathomable power of *dharma* water. To name it \"water\" seems too forceful; to not name it \"water\" is also too void.\n\nNow let us trace back from those who attain the *One*: The Dao begins with the *One* of old. Heaven opened from old, and through the *One* it opened. Yet without this water, there would be no division—how then would its clarity be seen?\n\nEarth was divided from old, and through the *One* it was divided. Yet without this water, there would be no support—how then could its tranquility be established?\n\nThe spirit was revered from old, and through the *One* it was revered. Yet without this water, there would be no nourishment—how then could its responsiveness be illuminated?\n\nThe grain was attained from old, and through the *One* it was attained. Yet without this water, there would be no containment—how then could it aid in its abundance?\n\nAll things were formed from old, and through the *One* they were formed. Yet without this water, there would be no cultivation—how then could it provide for their flourishing?\n\nLords and kings became rulers from old, and the *One* was their ruler. Yet without this water, there would be no benefit to use—how then could they secure the stability and rectitude of the world?\n\nHeaven, Earth, spirit, grain, all things, and lords and kings—each has its own form, yet the means by which they achieve clarity, tranquility, responsiveness, abundance, flourishing, and rectitude are all through the *One*.\n\nClarity without fracture comes from pure water-*qi*.\nTranquility without upheaval comes from bearing water-*qi*.\nResponsiveness without stagnation comes from flowing water-*qi*.\nAbundance without depletion comes from filled water-*qi*.\nFlourishing without annihilation comes from nourishing water-*qi*.\nRectitude without decline—those of noble status—water’s virtue aids them, for its nature is to flow downward from lowliness.\n\nFrom ancient times, rulers who were humble yet honored have shone. Thus, nobility stems from humility, elevation from the foundation of lowliness. \"Lonely and bereft, not seeking grain\"—this self-designation of lords and kings is indeed both humble and lowly. Yet those who do not know of their wealth in the Four Seas, their nobility as Heaven’s Son, or their jade-like sustenance from all quarters—it is through this very humility of \"lonely and bereft\" that they attain these things. Is this not the grounding in humility?\n\nIn general, lords and kings who preserve their humility are truly preserving the *One*.\n\nThus, from this perspective, one may extend to all things: as in the case of the *One* driving many carriages, where the multitude is recklessly harnessed, leading to ruin without awareness. Or as with jade’s restless brilliance and stone’s detached rigidity—these show the appearance of excess. Yet the *One* of the *Dao* does not desire to take them.\n\n(Chapter Forty) *(The River-Upper Master’s annotated version was originally titled \"Discarding Use\")*\n\n**Chapter Forty-One**\nThe return is the movement of the Dao;\nThe weak is the application of the Dao.\nAll things under Heaven are born from *having*;\n*Having* is born from *non-being*.\n\n**Return:** to restore.\nWhen Heaven and Earth merge in obscurity, the first movement of the Dao is the coming of *One Yang* [returning].\n**Weak:** softness.\nWhen the body and mind are serene and tranquil, when *qi* is concentrated to achieve softness—this is the wondrous application of the Dao.\n\nThe matter of the *Returned Elixir* lies in merging the *having* of *Qian* [Heaven] with the *non-being* of *Kun* [Earth], planting the seed of *Qian* so that *Kun* bears it. From *non-being* arises *having*—thus the Dao is born from *having*, and *having* from *non-being*.\nAll things under Heaven are like this.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two**\nThe Dao gives birth to *One*;\n*One* gives birth to *Two*;\n*Two* gives birth to *Three*;\n*Three* gives birth to all things.\n\nThe Dao stands above the Three Powers and precedes the Five Phases. The *Taoist Master* discusses creation.\nThus, it must begin with the Dao.\nThe Great Dao is formless, boundless in its unity.\nWhen motion arises from stillness, *One* then appears.\n*One* is water, corresponding to *Kǎn* [the trigram].\n*Kǎn* resides in the north, the trigram of labor.\nAll things begin and end through this.\nTo end is to return to the root;\nTo begin is the coming of *One Yang* [returning].\n*Yang* is fire, hence though water is spoken of, fire is within—*One* gives birth to *Two*.\nWhen water and fire are harmonized, when *yin* and *yang* are in accord, when wood stirs with vitality, when all things flourish—thus *Two* gives birth to *Three*, and *Three* to all things.\n\nThis broadly speaks of creation, yet the Dao of the *Returned Elixir* is also within it.\n\n**Note:** Later Heaven’s sequence is disordered and complex; when the Five Phases are fully invoked, their numbers are complete.\nMetal generates Water—*Four* generates *One*.\nWater generates Wood—*One* generates *Three*.\nWood generates Fire—*Three* generates *Two*.\nFire generates Earth—*Two* generates *Five*.\nEarth generates Metal—*Five* generates *Four*.\n\nThe Five Phases of Primordial Heaven are orderly and simple; three numbers suffice to encompass the five.\nWater conceals fire within—*One* generates *Two*.\nWood thrives with fire’s vigor—*Two* generates *Three*.\nWhen wood flourishes, it is the time when all things first emerge—*Three* can encompass all.\nMoreover, in the practice of refining the elixir, the Five Phases are all contained within *One* and *Two*. When water and fire are cultivated in duality, the numbers *Three*, *Four*, and *Five* assist them—thus it is unnecessary to emphasize *Three* alone.\nThe *Taoist Master* speaks of *Three* to exhaustively encompass all things, hence the mention of the number *Three*.\nNor is it necessary to speak of *Two*—*One qi* is the elixir; *Two*, *Three*, *Four*, and *Five* assist it. The Five Phases are all contained within *One*.\nWater conceals the *yang* fire within—*One* contains *Two*.\nWater hides the wood-mercury—*One* contains *Three*.\nWater reveals the metal-lead—*One* contains *Four*.\nWater embraces true earth—*One* contains *Five*.\nNor is it necessary to speak of *One*—the obscure and formless, the embryo in void, can also be contained within the Dao.\nIs not the art of the *Returned Elixir* supremely simple and easy?\nThough words are many, they return to the utmost essentials—only their profundity is honored, not their excess.\n\nAll things bear *yin* externally and embrace *yang* within, blending *qi* to achieve harmony.\nAbove, it is said that *Three* gives birth to all things—*Three* is the number of wood.\nThings flourish when wood is vigorous; wood thrives when fire is strong. Fire arises within water, thus the body of all things externally bears *yin* while internally embracing *yang*.\n\n「Externally *yin* and internally *yang*, externally void and internally substantial—this void encompasses *yang qi*, which is called *chóngqì* (penetrating *qi*).\nAt this point, all things align with the *Great Harmony* (Tàihé).\n\nNow, let us speak of this in terms of *elixir* (Dān) methods:\nWhen the receptive (*Kūn*) interacts with the creative (*Jiàn*), the *yang* metal transforms into *Kǎn* (Abyss).\nThe Abyss’s form is externally void and internally substantial—thus, one must use penetrating void to contain its *qi*, just as the *Great Harmony* (Tàihé) breathes forth in *yīnyūn* (misty vapors).\n\nWhat people despise—*singleness*, *widowhood*, and *barrenness*—are titles claimed by kings and nobles.\nThus, some things are diminished to gain, while others are gained to diminish.\nWhat people teach, I also teach: the *strong* and *violent* shall not die as they wish—I shall take them as my disciples.\n\nNone are more reviled than those with *lowly names*—*singleness*, *widowhood*, and *barrenness*—yet kings and nobles embrace these titles.\nThough it may tarnish their reputation, it truly benefits them.\n\nHence, when observing all things, there are those who gain by loss and lose by gain—this is understood through contemplating the *Dao* of the *Yì* (Book of Changes).\n\nThe *Pǐ* (Negation) hexagram: *yang* above and *yin* below, seeking to transform into *Yì* (Gain).\nThe *Way* of Heaven does not presume to exalt itself.\nThus, by diminishing above and augmenting below, the *Pǐ* (Negation) phase—where Heaven and Earth do not interact—can shift into the *Yì* (Gain) phase of *yang* descending upon *yin*.\nTherefore, the virtuous person uses it to move toward goodness and amend faults.\n\nThe *Tài* (Greatness) hexagram: *yin* above and *yang* below, seeking to know the *Way* of diminishing.\nThe *Way* of Earth cannot be self-sufficient.\nThus, by diminishing below and augmenting above, the *Tài* (Greatness) phase—where Heaven and Earth interact—also follows its *Way* in the upward course of diminishing.\nTherefore, the virtuous person uses it to restrain anger and curb desires.\n\nHeaven and Earth gain by diminishing—thus, *to use gain is not as effective as to use diminishing*.\n\nThe two hexagrams stand equal, yet one should emulate the *Way* of the diminishing hexagram.\nWhat of *mountains* and *marshes* diminishing? If inverted and applied, they become *wind* and *thunder* for gain.\n*Mountains*, *marshes*, *wind*, and *thunder* respond in kind—this is precisely because of diminishing.\n\nThis is *teaching*; this is the *Yì*’s teaching; this is the teaching of the ancients.\n\nThe *Tàishàng* (Supreme Sage) said:\n*\"What people teach, I also teach\"—*\nI instruct people to know the *Way* of self-diminishing.*」\n\n「What is not virtuous, the virtuous person’s foundation relies upon—\nthus, the *Way* again employs the *strong and unyielding* as its *teaching father*.\n\nThe *strong and unyielding* are those who seize by force—\nthey diminish others to benefit themselves,\nyet ultimately gain nothing.\n\n*Father* and *foundation* share the same root,\nboth following the upper tone.\n\n**Chapter 43** (*Héshànggōng*’s annotation reads *Biān yòng* [偏用] Chapter, *Péng*’s version is *Zhì róu* [至柔] Chapter)\n【The most yielding in all under Heaven\ncan gallop across the most

their ears and eyes,\nGazing upward, listening downward,\nEach with their own expectations—\nThe Sage treats them as children,\nThus achieving harmony.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 50**\n(*River Master’s version: \"Chapter on Valuing Life\"; Peng’s version: \"Chapter on Nurturing Life\"*)\n\nTo be born is to enter death.\nThose who cling to life—\nThirteen out of ten.\nThose who accept death—\nThirteen out of ten.\nThe people’s birth is their movement toward death’s ground—\nAlso thirteen out of ten.\nWhy so?\nBecause their attachment to life is excessive.\n\n---\n\nNow the Sage who nurtures life well,\nWalks on land yet meets no rhinoceros or tiger,\nEnters battle yet is not harmed by armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to strike with its horn,\nThe tiger finds no place to place its claws,\nWeapons find no room to wield their blades.\nWhy so?\nBecause there is no place of death for him.\n\nAll things are born and then enter death,\nYet all lie within the thirteen out of ten.\nNow, the thirteen out of ten—\nAll previous commentaries have failed to grasp its true meaning,\nAnd I shall now elucidate it.\nTen is the number of Heaven and Earth’s creation.\nOne Heaven, one Earth,\nOne **Yáng** (乾), one **Yīn** (坤).\nThe **Yáng** hexagram has three **Yáng** lines,\nThe **Yīn** hexagram has three **Yīn** lines.\nAll things encounter the three **Yáng** lines and are born,\nEncounter the three **Yīn** lines and die.\nYet for humanity’s birth,\nThey share in the three **Yáng** lines with all things,\nBut when entering the three **Yīn** lines, they hasten it themselves.\nThe seven emotions and six desires\nSeverely deplete the primordial spirit—\nHence, it is said: *\"to move is to enter the realm of death.\"*\n\nYet even when they hasten death themselves,\nThey still return to the three **Yīn** lines.\nWhy do things and humans have three births and three deaths?\nBecause excessive attachment to life\nLeads to death being extinguished, yet life again added.\nWhen death is extinguished, life stirs once more—\nThis is the cyclical, interdependent force.\nOtherwise, if there were birth without death,\nThe myriad things would proliferate endlessly, filling the world—\nHow then could there be any orderly settlement?\n\nThough all things die in winter and are born in spring,\nTheir birth and death are merely transformations of movement and stillness.\nAs for humans, once dead, they do not rebirth—\nNot because Heaven and Earth’s transformations wait for them,\nBut because they do not know how to nurture life,\nThus they fall long into the realm of death.\n\nThe **Tian Di** (Heaven-Earth) has the virtue of abundant life,\nThe Sage has the method of nurturing life—\nIf humans diligently seek it,\nThey should reverse the **Yáng**-born **Yīn**-dying Dao,\nTransforming it into the **Yáng**-advancing **Yīn**-retreating function,\nThen longevity and enduring vision may be achieved,\nAnd they shall not be the same as those who are born and die,\nMoving into the realm of death like common folk.\n\nThings have three **Yáng** lines for their birth,\nAnd three **Yīn** lines for their death.\nThe Dao of nurturing life,\nIs to embed one **Yáng** line within the three **Yīn** lines of the **Yáng** hexagram,\nThus **Yīn** becomes solid and forms the **Kǎn** (坎) hexagram.\nThe three **Yīn** lines of the **Yīn** hexagram,\nSprout one **Yīn** line within the three **Yáng** lines,\nThus **Yáng** becomes hollow and forms the **Lí** (离) hexagram.\n**Kǎn** and **Lí**—these are the medicinal substances.\nEntering the chamber to cultivate in stillness,\nObserve my one **Yáng** line returning and reviving—\nThen practice the nurturing method,\nMaking it rise and fall.\nThis is the Dao of **Huán Dàn** (还丹),\nThe function of returning to the origin,\nThe art of extending life,\nThe secret of attaining immortality.\n\nTo reverse and return is nurturing,\nTo descend and ascend is nurturing,\nTo externalize and internalize is nurturing—\nWithin, there is the **Huáng Pó** (黄婆),\nOnly then can nurturing be achieved.\nNurturing is not easily spoken of.\nWhen the **Zǐ** (子) and **Mǔ** (母) are deeply intertwined,\nTheir cultivation runs profound—\nWhen the infant and maiden coexist,\nTheir joy is boundless—\nWhen **Yīn** (铅) and **Yáng** (汞) coalesce,\nThe sacred embryo forms—\nWhen **Wu Wéi** (无为) is verified,\nThe **Yáng** spirit emerges.\nThough rhinoceros, tiger, and weapons of war exist,\nThey have no place to wreak havoc—\nHow could they then have three **Yáng** lines for birth,\nAnd three **Yīn** lines for death,\nLike ordinary humans and things?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 51**\n(*River Master’s version: \"Chapter on Nurturing Virtue\"; Peng’s version: \"Chapter on Revering and Honoring\"*)\n\nThe **Dao** gives birth to it,\n**Virtue** (德) nurtures it,\nThings take form from it,\nAnd **shì** (势, force/condition) completes it.\nThus, all things do not fail to revere the **Dao** and honor **Virtue**.\nThe **Dao**’s reverence,\n**Virtue**’s honor—\nNone command them, yet they ever arise naturally.\nHence, the **Dao** gives birth to it,\n**Virtue** nurtures it, lengthens it, and cultivates it,\nCompletes it, matures it,\nFosters it, and protects it.\nIt gives birth yet does not possess it,\nActs yet does not rely upon it,\nLengthens yet does not rule it.\nThis is called **Xuán Dé** (玄德, Mysterious Virtue).\n\nThe **Dao** sows things,\n**Virtue** guards things—\nThus things are born by the **Dao** and nurtured by **Virtue**.\nThings manifest their forms,\nAnd **shì** (势) alone can complete them.\nAll things revere the **Dao** and honor **Virtue**,\nBecause the **Dao** is nameless, while **Virtue** has a name;\nThe **Dao**’s reverence,\n**Virtue**’s honor—\n**Dao** and **Virtue** have no need to command or enforce,\nThings’ nature spontaneously aligns.\nOnly the **Dao** governs birth,\nOnly **Virtue** governs nurturing.\nTo lengthen, cultivate, and mature—\nAnd to foster and protect—\nBinding and preserving the whole spirit,\nAll are **Virtue**’s techniques.\nNot possessing, not relying, nor ruling—\nAchieving without action is true enlightenment.\n**Xuán Dé** (玄德) is the highest **Virtue**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 52**\n(*River Master’s version: \"Chapter on Returning to the Origin\"; Peng’s version: \"Chapter on Having a Beginning\"*)\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nWhich serves as the mother of the world.\nHaving obtained its mother,\nOne may know its child.\nHaving known its child,\nOne must again guard its mother,\nAnd thus, throughout life, one shall not perish.\nBlock its **Yuè** (兑, Joy),\nClose its gate,\nAnd one shall never tire throughout life.\nOpen its **Yuè** (兑),\nAnd aid its affairs,\nYet one shall never be saved throughout life.\nTo perceive the small is clarity,\nTo guard the soft is strength.\nUsing its light,\nYet returning to its clarity,\nOne shall not suffer bodily harm.\nThis is called **Xí Cháng** (袭常, Following the Constant).\n\nThe **Dao** of the world has an end, yet must have a beginning;\nIndeed, its beginning is not a single point.\n\n**Jīn Dān** (金丹, Golden Elixir) has:\nA place of origin, matters of practice, and substances of return.\nWhat is the place of origin?\nIt is the **Kūn** (坤, Earth) Furnace and the **Yīn** (阴, Yin) Furnace—\nThe **Yīn Yáng** (阴阳, Yin-Yang) Furnace, for within the **Yīn** (阴, Yin) lies concealed the **Yáng** (阳, Yang).\nThe **Yǎn Yuè** (偃月, Reclined Moon) Furnace, for the moon manifests in the **Yuè** (兑, Joy) direction.\nThe **Xiān Tiān Miào Dǐng** (先天妙鼎, Primordial Wondrous Cauldron), for **Yuè** (兑) is the young maiden.\n\n*The Awakening to Reality* (《悟真》) speaks of “the **Chuǎn Yào Chuān Yuán** (产药川源, Birthplace of the Elixir’s Stream),” all referring to the place of origin.\n\nWhat are the matters of practice?\nTo attain utmost emptiness, to steadfastly preserve stillness—\nThen I observe its return.\nWith mud, one clarifies;\nWith stillness, one slowly purifies.\nWith tranquility, one endures;\nWith waiting, one carefully nurtures.\nAll these are matters of practice.\n\nWhat is the substance of return?\n**Hún Hún** (混混) becomes **Chéng Chéng** (成成),\n**Yǎo Yǎo** (窈窈) meets **Míng Míng** (冥冥),\nWithin which there is **Xìn** (信, Faith),\nWithin which there is **Jīng** (精, Essence).\nThe **Pǔ** (朴, Uncarved Primordial) without name,\nThe **Jīn** (金, Metal) without form—\nAll these are the substances of return.\n\nThe **Golden Elixir** (还丹) begins with this **Jīn** (金, Metal),\nThus it is called “having a beginning.”\nYet this **Jīn** (金, Metal) is not originally the **Kūn** (坤, Earth) family’s possession,\nBut the **Huǒ Jīng** (火精, Fire Essence) of the **Jiān** (乾, Heaven) family.\n\nThe **Dān Fǎ** (丹法, Elixir Method) takes **shā** (砂, sand) as its foundation,\nPlaced in the **Kūn** (坤, Earth) Furnace to form **Kǎn** (坎, Abyss),\nHarmonized with the **Yù Pó** (玉池, Jade Pool)’s **shuǐ yín** (水银, mercury) to create **wù tǔ** (戊土, Fifth-Earth Soil),\nWhich is the **Yáng Dān** (阳丹, Yang Elixir).\n\nThe **Yáng Dān** (阳丹, Yang Elixir) is the **Wài Dān** (外丹, External Elixir),\nThe **External Elixir** is the **Dān Běn** (丹本, Elixir Root),\nThe **Jīn Huā** (金花, Golden Flower) is it,\nThe **Zhēn Zhǒng** (真种, True Seed) is it,\nThe **Huáng Yá** (黄芽, Yellow Sprout) is it,\nThe **Bái Xuě** (白雪, White Snow) is it.\nThe **External Elixir** serves as the mother of the **Nèi Dān** (内丹, Internal Elixir),\nThus the beginning is called the mother of the world.\n\nThe mother has a sacred name: **Yáng Qiān** (阳铅, Yang Lead).\nWith **Yang Lead** as mother,\nThere is **Yīn Gǒng** (阴汞, Yin Mercury) as child.\n**Yīn Gǒng** (阴汞) is the **Hòu Tiān** (后天, Postnatal) essence of the child,\n**Yáng Qiān** (阳铅) is the **Xiān Tiān** (先天, Primordial) essence of the mother.\nWhen the **Yang Lead** from the outer realm subjugates the **Yīn Gǒng** (阴汞, Yin Mercury) of the inner realm,\nThe mother and child unite—\nThus one knows its child.\n\nYet the arrival of this **Yang Lead** requires the subtle application of **Huǒ Gōng** (火功, Fire Work).\nFor **lead** (铅) is generated in the **Kǎn Gōng** (坎宫, Abyss Palace),\nHeavy and unrising.\nTo seize and control the **Zhēn Gǒng** (真汞, True Mercury) of the **Lí Gōng** (离宫, Separation Palace),\nOne must apply fierce **wǔ huǒ** (武火, Martial Fire) to boil,\nThen it ascends in leaps and bounds.\nAfter the **Yang Lead** and **True Mercury** meet,\nOne must then preserve the **Shì Chéng** (守城, Fortifying) and **Mù Yù** (沐浴, Bathing) stages,\nNever again applying **Martial Fire**.\n\nAt first, the mother clings to the child in coming,\nThen the child clings to the mother in dwelling—\nThus it is said, *“Having known its child, one must again guard its mother.”*\nWhen mother and child cling to each other,\nOne shall not perish throughout life—\nThen the Great Elixir is complete.\n\nThe Great Elixir is called **Nèi Yào** (内药, Internal Medicine),\nThe **Sèng Tāi** (圣胎, Sacred Embryo) is this,\nThe **Yīng’ér** (婴儿, Infant) is this,\nThe **Zhēn Rén** (真人, True Person) is this.\n\nThose who cultivate the **Internal Elixir** must possess **Tiānrán Zhēn Huǒ** (天然真火, True Heavenly Fire),\nEndlessly nurtured within the **Tǔ Fǔ** (土釜, Earthen Cauldron),\nYet also rely on the **Yīn Yáng Fú Huǒ** (阴阳符火, Yin-Yang Talismanic Fire) of the external furnace,\nDiligently refining and adjusting.\n\nBy drawing and replenishing,\nOne transforms form into **qi** (气),\nAnd **qi** into **shén** (神, Spirit).\nWhen form and spirit are both perfected,\nThey align with the **Dao** in truth.\nThus one must block its **Yuè** (兑, Joy),\nAnd close its gate,\nFor the entire life’s work lies here.\n\nNurturing both kinds—\nThe **Wén Huǒ** (文火, Gentle Fire) within and the **Fú Huǒ** (符火, Talismanic Fire) without—\nPreserving the full ten months,\nAbandoning contrivance to realize non-action,\nOne dare not tire from external affairs,\nLest they disrupt the inner stillness.\n\n*The Three Harmonies* (《参同》) states:\n*“Firmly block its interactions,\nEndeavor to complete its solidity.\nObserve and wait with utmost caution,\nCarefully adjust its cold and warmth.\nCirculate through the twelve nodes,\nWhen each node is exhausted, again draw near.”*\nThis is the method of nurturing.\n\nThe inner realm does not escape,\nThe outer realm does not intrude—\nBlocking **Yuè** (兑) and closing the gate\nIs the essential key.\n\nIf one does not block its **Yuè** (兑),\nAnd instead daily engages with external affairs,\nThe **Dao** Family often speaks of temporal matters—\nThis is to seek aid in external schemes,\nYet already one has injured the inner cultivation.\nWhen the mouth opens, **shénqì** (神气, Spirit-Qi) scatters;\nWhen the mind is unsettled, **Fire Work** weakens.\nThe Great **Dao** of longevity\nI fear may not be fulfilled—\nThus it is said: *“Aid its affairs, yet one shall never be saved throughout life.”*\n\nTo perceive the small is called clarity—\nThe **Jīn Guāng** (金光, Golden Light) of the elixir,\nIts form like **shǔ mǐ** (黍米, millet grains),\nThus it is called small.\nTo see this small is called clarity.\n\nTo guard the soft is called strength—\nThe **Wáng Shuǐ** (王水, King Water) of the body,\nIts **qi** originally balanced and gentle,\nThus it is called soft.\nTo guard this soft is called strength.\n\nThe **Guāng** (光, Light) is the **shén** (神, Spirit),\nThat is, the **Golden Light**.\nThe **Míng** (明, Clarity) is the **qì** (气, Qi),\nThat is, the **Jīn Jīng** (金精, Metal Essence).\nWhen the **Golden Light** envelops the **Metal Essence**,\nThen light and clarity are concealed within,\nAnd **shénqì** (神气, Spirit-Qi) rely upon each other.\n\nWhen the embryonic nurturing is complete,\nOne escapes the calamities of the body—\nThus it is said: *“Using its light, yet returning to its clarity, one shall not suffer bodily harm.”*\nThis is called the **Dao** of *Following the Constant* (袭常),\nThe cultivation of longevity and enduring vision.\n\n*Following the Constant* means guarding its true constancy.\n\n**Mountain Evaluation**: This chapter is explained verse by verse with clarity,\nEach word extracted with precision—\nThe **Dao** of the **Golden Elixir** is fully revealed here.\nI have often said that the **Tàishàng** (太上, Supreme) Classic,\nThough concise in meaning,\nEven true immortals cannot fully grasp—\nYet how clear are these annotations!\nDelightful indeed!\nExceedingly joyous!\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three**\n*(River Master’s version titled \"Beneficial Proof,\" Peng’s version titled \"Jiérán\")*\n\n*\"Let my family’s resolve be firm and knowing,\nWalking the Great

shortcuts,\nStriving for crooked paths.\nFrivolous deeds invite calamity,\nDraining essence, scattering spirit.\n\nLike the court’s old offices—\nOnce stripped of their rank,\nThe original yang is utterly lost.\nLike the boundaries of fields—\nAll overgrown with weeds,\nThe orifices are all blocked.\nLike the granaries’ stores—\nAll wasted away,\nThe essence and qi are utterly depleted.\n\nThey merely adorn themselves in embroidered finery,\nBelt on sharp blades,\nChase after those who glut on food and drink,\nAnd vainly imagine wealth is sufficient.\nSuch people\nTake stealing the Dao as their heart’s intent—\nLike one stealing through a wall with a pole,\nDarkly snatching objects—\nThis is merely called *stealing with a pole*.\nHow could this be the Dao?\nHow could this be the Dao?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 54** (*Guangshang Gong’s commentary reads \"Xiu Guan\" [修观], Peng’s reads \"Shan Jian\" [善建]*)\nThe **Way of True Virtue** is unshaken,\nThe **Way of True Embrace** is

is complete in the self,\nThe demonstration of the **Dao** is boundless,\nThus the world is known through this.\n\n**Chapter 55** (*Guangshang Gong’s commentary reads \"Xuan Fu\" [玄符], Peng’s reads \"Han De\" [含德]*)\nThe depth of **virtue** contained\nIs likened to that of an infant.\nVenomous insects do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not seize,\nRaptors do not snatch.\n\nBones frail, sinews soft, yet grasp is firm.\nUnknowing of male and female union yet remains intact—**virtue** is at its peak.\nAll day wailing and swallowing without hoarseness—**harmony** is at its peak.\n\nTo know **harmony** is to know **constancy**,\nTo know **constancy** is to know **clarity**.\nTo grow with benefit is called **auspicious**.\nThe heart commanding *qi* is called **force**.\n\nWhen things flourish, they age—this is called *not* the **Dao**,\nAnd *not* the **Dao** brings early decline.\n\n*Han* (含): to cherish.\nCherishing **virtue** deeply is the **True Person** (真人).\nThe **True Person**’s heart\nDoes not lose the infant’s heart,\nThus likened to an infant—purely forgetful of things.\n\nThus, even evil insects and beasts do not harm.\nBones frail, sinews soft—this is the infant’s body,\nYet its grasp is firm.\n\nWhen people know of male and female union,\nThen the infant’s **virtue** is diminished and life is lost.\nThe infant, unknowing, retains **virtue** at its purest—\nIt has no desires.\n\n*Nou* (朘): the infant’s **yin** essence, also to shrink.\nThe common folk use *gōu suō* (肭缩) for *nou suō* (朘缩), meaning to shrink without lifting.\n\nWhen people rage, their *qi* becomes hoarse,\nBut the infant has wailing and swallowing without hoarseness.\nWailing is calling out,\nSwallowing is gulping.\nAll day calling and gulping without hoarseness—\nThis is the peak of **harmony** in *qi*.\n\nIf one knows **harmony**, then **constancy** is guarded without fail.\nIf one knows **constancy**, then **True Clarity** is naturally present.\n\nIndeed, there are benefits to human life—\nThe infant’s auspicious and harmonious *qi*.\nIf one were to possess knowledge and awareness,\nAnd command *qi* with the heart,\nThen it would reverse softness and become **force**.\n\nThe world’s lovers of **force** have also observed this in things.\nThe last three sentences are explained in the previous thirty chapters.\n\n**Chapter 56**\n\n---\n\n**(Chapter 57 –

noble under heaven.\n\nThe knowing are those who have attained through practice.\nThe unspeaking are difficult to articulate,\nFor their profound cultivation and self-realization\nYearn to speak yet the tongue cannot keep pace.\nIf one merely values speech,\nAnd claims, *“I have mastered the true scriptures of the Daoists,\nTheir transmission is complete,\nNo need for a teacher’s guidance—\nMy Way is ready to be walked.”*\nHow could they know that **True** is indeed **True**,\nYet the subtle intricacies, the refined analogies,\nThe deep mechanisms of its teachings—\nI fear they have not yet fully explored them?\n\nMoreover, **ascending to the True** and entering the **Dao**,\nIs none other than **returning to the elixir** (还丹).\nOnce the **elixir’s principles** (还丹理) are clear,\nOnly then can one attain the **Dao**.\nNow I ask you:\nWhat are the **乾坤坎兑**—the **Hexagrams of Heaven, Earth, Water, and Fire**?\nWhat are the **龙虎汞铅**—the **Dragon, Tiger, Mercury, and Lead**?\nWhat are the **宾主雌雄**—the **Guest, Host, Yin, and Yang**?\nHow does one **体认** (embody and recognize) **恍惚杳冥**—the **flickering and boundless**?\nHow does one **安排** (settle) **浮沉颠倒**—the **rising and sinking,

**consummation**?\n\nFurthermore, the **words are hard to convey**,\nThe **grace and awe are hard to spread**,\nThe **first opportunity is hard to find**,\nThe **fire’s intensity is hard to

me: Where are such teachings recorded?\n\n**Even more so**, the **practice and discipline** (功夫行持)\nCannot be borrowed from books.\nTo **abandon desire for beauty**,\nTo **forsake wealth for

its **Way**.\n\nTo **follow the map and seek the horse** (按图索骥),\nIs it enough to exhaust its subtleties?\nThus, the knowing do not speak,\nThe speaking do not know—\nBecause there are things **too

not be fully understood in a few words—\nHow much less so for those below them?\n\nNowadays, people regard **oral transmission** as a **quickened secret**,\nBut this is all incorrect.\nUnless **oral transmission** is fully exhausted,\nThe teacher departs and returns.\nDuring their **instructive inquiries**,\nOne must **listen attentively, absorb deeply, and remember truly**.\nThen, it can **connect with the ancient texts**,\nAnd **illuminate the layered principles**.\nThis is the **wondrous essence of oral transmission**—\nWhen people read the **Elixir Scriptures**, if they have many,\nYet upon hearing the **oral transmission**,\nThey **suddenly awaken**—\nUsing the **Scriptures to verify the transmission**,\nUsing the **transmission to verify the Scriptures**,\nTrue and not hollow,\nIn accord with the **Great Dao**.\nThis is why **true teachers must be sought**,\nAnd why **bright minds cannot rely on mere cleverness alone**.\n\nMoreover, **true teachers** are **rooted in the original**,\nTheir **foundation is the soil of yin virtue** (阴德之土),\nRefined and cultivated—\nHow could they not know the **heavy mysteries of the Dao**?\nHeaven grants these **secret words** to the **good**,\nYet not to the **unworthy**.\nIf one knows yet **speaks lightly of them**,\nThen **Zhu Yang** (紫阳) would have **three times banished** them.\nTheir **silence is not mere reluctance to speak lightly**—\nEven if **great vessels meet**,\nAnd the **urgency of passing the torch** is keen,\nThey must **test repeatedly and temper thoroughly**.\nOnly then, after the **disciple’s diligent suffering**,\nDoes the **teacher reveal the fragrance, spread the teachings, and pass the bowl**.\nThis is the **future lineage’s unfolding**—\nBeware of hearing yet **not practicing**,\nOr obtaining yet **keeping secret**.\nWhen spoken of thus,\nIs it not **difficult**?\n\nMy **commentary on the *Laozi’s Dao De Jing***,\nThough more detailed than the explanations of earlier sages,\nStill, in **sequentially annotating each chapter**,\nI **follow the Scriptures’ remnants**,\nYet **cannot fully expound the Dao’s wondrous mechanisms** in continuous passages.\n**Heroes and resolute scholars**,\nFortunate are those who **find a clear teacher**\nTo **pierce and reveal**—\nThen their **attainment of the law** will be all the easier.\n\n**Discussing the first two lines of this chapter**,\n*Sealing the mouth* (塞兑) and *shutting the door* (闭门)\nIs **nurturing the spirit and *qi*** (养神气).\n*Dulling the sharpness* (挫锐) yet **not being dulled by it**,\nIs **guarding the weak**.\n*Unraveling the tumult* (解纷) yet **not being disturbed by it**,\nIs **remaining steadfast and composed**.\n*Harmonizing the radiance* (和光) yet **keeping its luminosity hidden**,\n*Unifying the dust* (同尘) yet **rising above it**.\nMencius said:\n*“The sage’s relation to the people is like this.”*\nThis is the **essence of Mysterious Unity**.\n\nThus, it cannot be grasped as intimate,\nNor as distant—\nIf it could be grasped as intimate,\nThen it could be grasped as distant.\nIf it cannot be **beneficial or harmful**,\nIf it cannot be **noble or lowly**,\nIt is the same in this regard.\nThus, it is the **most noble under heaven**,\nWith **no greater nobility than the sage’s virtue**.\n\n**Chapter 57**\n\nThe world abounds in taboos and prohibitions,\nYet the people grow ever poorer.\nThe people possess many sharp implements,\nAnd the state becomes ever more corrupt.\nThe people develop many skills and artifices,\nAnd strange, licentious things proliferate.\nLaws and decrees grow ever more explicit,\nAnd thieves and robbers multiply.\nThus the sage says:\n*“I act with non-action, yet the people transform themselves.\nI love tranquility, yet the people align themselves.\nI create no affairs, yet the people grow rich.\nI have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.”*\n\n**Steadfastness** (正) is not merely upright posture—\nIt is the teaching of reverence,\nCausing them to be moved and trust.\n**Mysterious Unity** (奇) is not the same as deceitful scheming—\nIt is the teaching of quiet restraint,\nMaking them hard to fathom.\nThus, the sage must govern with **steadfastness**,\nAnd employ **Mysterious Unity** in warfare.\n\nTo take the world with **non-action** (无事),\nIs to achieve success with **non-action** (无为).\nThis is the way to know the **Dao/Way of governing the world** (治世之道)\nThrough the **Dao/Way of cultivating oneself** (治身之道).\n\nWhen the court abounds in taboos and prohibitions,\nGreedy and base ministers advance,\nAnd thus the people are made poor.\nWhen the people possess many sharp implements,\nCrafty and deceitful individuals arise,\nAnd thus the state grows corrupt.\nWhen skills and artifices please the ruler,\nStrange and licentious things must proliferate.\nWhen laws and decrees oppress the people,\nThieves and robbers will surely increase.\nThese are all deviations in governance.\n\nThus, the sage further cites the words of the ancients,\nTo observe the **constant principle of governance** (治道之常),\nWhich lies in the distinction between **having desires** (有欲) and **without desires** (无欲).\n\n**Chapter 58**\n\n---\n\nWhen governance is **obscure and unassuming** (閟閟),\nIts people are **sincere and pure** (醇醇).\nWhen governance is **overly scrutinizing and strict** (察察),\nIts people are **deceitful and cunning** (缺缺).\nCalamity (祸) is where fortune (福) leans,\nFortune is where calamity lurks.\nWho knows its limits?\nIt is because there is no **steadfastness** (正).\n\n**Steadfastness** (正) becomes **Mysterious Unity** (奇),\n**Virtue/power** (德) becomes **bewitching** (妖).\nThe people’s confusion is longstanding.\n\nThus, the sage is square yet does not cut,\nHonest yet does not harm,\nDirect yet does not overreach,\nBright yet does not dazzle.\n\nWhen governance is **unassuming and sincere** (醇醇)—its simplicity fostering tranquility—\nthe people find peace in stillness.\nWhen governance is **rigid and exacting** (察察),\nthe people grow **negligent and evasive** (缺缺).\n\nWhere misfortune and fortune intertwine,\nfew grasp their true measure—\nfor who can guard **steadfastness** (正) when none perceive its bounds?\nThe words *\"steadfast\"* and *\"know\"* carry a sigh:\nhow can one uphold what is unseen?\n\n**Steadfastness** (正) is the straight **Dao/Way**,\nyet when abandoned, it twists into **strangeness and deceit**.\n**Virtue/power** (德) is harmony itself,\nyet without it, it curdles into **omen and malevolence**.\nThus, when the people stray so long—\nis it not the work of years?\n\n*\"Cutting\"* (割) is severing,\n*\"wounding\"* (刿) is harm,\n*\"overreaching\"* (肆) is reckless haste,\n*\"dazzling\"* (耀) is ostentation—\nall lead the people astray.\n\nOnly the sage is **square without sharp edges**,\nupright yet unyielding in injury,\nwalking the straight path while concealing brilliance—\nthus aligning with the **Dao/Way’s true course**.\n\n**Chapter 59**\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of governing people and serving **Heaven**—\nnone surpasses **frugality** (啬),\nthis is called *\"early service\"*.\n\n*\"Early service\"* means accumulating **virtue/power** (德) in abundance,\naccumulating **virtue/power** (德) in abundance means nothing is unconquered,\nnothing is unconquered means none can fathom its limits,\nnone can fathom its limits—\nthen one may possess a **state**.\n\nA **state** is the root of longevity,\none may endure for ages.\nThis is called the **Dao/Way** of *deep-rooted and firm*,\nof *eternal life and lasting vision*.\n\n---\n**Frugality** (啬): parsimony.\n**Early service** (早服): refers to enriching the state and bringing peace to the people.\n**Accumulating virtue/power** (积德): refers to the people’s peace securing the state’s wealth and prosperity.\n**Unconquered** (克): victorious.\n\nJust as treating affairs with **frugality** (啬) brings wealth and peace to the state,\nso the people’s peace ensures the state’s wealth and victory in war—\nvictory in war means none can know its end.\nWhen benevolence overflows and kindness runs deep,\none must surely gain the **state**.\n\n**State** (国): refers to the foundation of the realm.\nThe realm’s foundation established,\none deposits true sand in the jade pool,\nwhile first refining its lead mother.\nThe lead mother seizes the **mercury child** (汞子),\nthen one may enjoy the **state**’s longevity.\n\nThis is called the cultivation of *deep-rooted and firm*,\nthe **Dao/Way** of *eternal life and lasting vision*.\n**Deep-rooted and firm** (根蒂): returning to the root to subdue the **qi** (气),\nnurturing the stem to preserve the spirit (神).\n\n**Chapter 60**\n\n「To govern a great state, one must treat it as delicately as cooking a small fish.\nTo rule the world with the **Dao/Way** (道), its demons shall not be fearsome.\nNot that the demons are not fearsome—\ntheir spirit shall not harm the people.\nNot that their spirit harms no one—\nthe sage also harms none.\nWhen both do not harm each other,\n**virtue/power** (德) returns and merges.\n\n**Chapter 61**\n---\n【The great state is like the *lower reaches* (下流), the confluence of the world,\nthe receptive of the world.\nThe receptive ever conquers the active through stillness,\nand stillness is the *lower reaches*.\nThus the great state yields to the small state and takes the small state;\nthe small state yields to the great state and takes the great state.\nSo sometimes one yields to take,\nsometimes one yields and is taken.\nThe great state, with its great excess (大过),\nseeks to nourish and sustain all under its rule.\nThe small state, with its small excess (小过),\nseeks to enter and serve others.\nWhen both attain their desires,\nthe greater should thus take the *lower reaches*.\n\n---\nThis chapter instructs the lords of the world to practice yielding to embrace the smaller states.\nThe *lower reaches* (下流) is where all waters gather—\ncomparing the great state’s dominion over lesser states,\nhence the saying: *\"The great state is like the lower reaches,\"*\nnot that it resides in the lower reaches.\n\nIt unites vassals and tributaries,\nso it is called the *confluence of the world*.\nIt should employ soft **virtue/power** (德),\nhence likened to the receptive of the world.\n\nThe receptive (牝) is soft **Dao/Way** (道);\nthe active (牡) is rigid **Dao/Way**.\nThough the small state is rigid,\nthe great state conquers it through soft stillness—\nthus stillness is the **virtue/power** of yielding and humility.\n\nWhen the great state yields to the small state,\nthe small state rejoices to become its loyal subject,\nand its annual provisions may be gathered.\nWhen the small state yields to the great state,\nthe great state may have intentions of reward,\nand its yearly offerings may be invited.\n\nThus sometimes one yields to take,\nsometimes one takes while yielding.\nThe great and small mutually depend on each other.\n\nThe great state’s excess (大过) is likened to the *Easy* (易) **Dao/Way**.\nThe *Ze-Feng* (泽风) hexagram benefits in ventures,\nso its imagery compares it to water drowning wood—\nwater rising high, and all its wood submerged,\na symbol of great excess.\nThe sweet dew descending from Kunlun (昆仑)\noriginally benefits ventures as *Hen* (亨),\naligning perfectly with the great excess—\nspirit transforms into **qi** (气), and **qi** into essence (精),\nfilling the *Dan Tian* (丹田).\n\nThus it has the **virtue/power** of seeking to nourish and sustain all.\n\nThe small state’s excess (小过) is also likened to the *Easy* **Dao/Way**.\nThe *Lei-Shan* (雷山) hexagram benefits in steadfastness,\nso its imagery compares it to a bird’s lingering cry—\na bird should descend to be heard,\na symbol of small excess.\nThe true essence (真液) descending from the *Dan Tian*\noriginally benefits steadfastness as *Ji* (吉),\nmatching perfectly with the small excess—\nessence generates **qi**, and **qi** generates spirit,\nsoaring to depend on the *Huang Ting* (黄庭).\n\nThus it has the **Dao/Way** of seeking to enter and serve others.\n\n---\nThe great state, Kunlun (昆仑),\nits essence flows downward into the *Yuan Hai* (元海).\nThe essence further transforms into **qi**,\nand enters the *Dan Tian* (丹田).\nWhen the great state yields to the small state,\nits essence flows downward from Kunlun to the *Dan Tian* to generate **qi**—\nthus the one who takes the *Dan Tian*’s **qi** is the yielding to take.\n\nOr when the *Dan Tian*’s **qi** ascends back to Kunlun to generate essence,\nthe one who swallows Kunlun’s essence is the taking while yielding.\n\nThe great state’s excess (大过) is indeed drawn from the *Easy* **Dao/Way**.\nIts essence, like Kunlun’s sweet nectar,\ndescends to the *Huang Ting* (黄庭),\nwhere the **qi** of the *Dan Tian* is gathered and reversed—\nthis is the yielding to take.\n\nThe small state’s excess (小过) is also drawn from the *Easy* **Dao/Way**.\nIts essence, like the *Dan Tian*’s true nectar,\nascends back to Kunlun,\nwhere Kunlun’s essence is merged and falls into the *Huang Ting*—\nthis is the taking while yielding.\n\nThe great state’s excess (大过) is likened to the *Ze-Feng* (泽风) hexagram,\nwhere water submerges wood—\nthe great state’s essence, overflowing like the waters,\nseeks to sustain all under its rule.\n\nThe small state’s excess (小过) is likened to the *Lei-Shan* (雷山) hexagram,\nwhere a bird’s lingering cry signifies descent—\nthe small state’s essence, descending like the bird,\nseeks to enter and serve the great state.\n\nWhen both great and small attain their desires,\nit is all because of the great state’s yielding to the small.»\n\n「Rising and descending, one after the other,\nmutually supporting, mutually preserving,\nreversing the Heaven and Earth,\ncountering the flow of the Yellow River.\n\nThe subtlest method of cultivating the self\nis none other than this.\n\n*Commentary*:\nThus, some lines read: \"The Yellow Court lies below, gathering Kunlun’s essence,\" then it is the **taking while descending**.\nAgain, some read: \"The Yellow Court reflects below, collecting the *Dan Tian*’s **qi**,\" then it is the **taking while descending**.\n\nThis meaning may also be observed in context.\n\n*Master Wu’s Appraisal*:\nThe Yellow Court is the domain for nurturing the heart,\nthe **female gate** (牝户) is the source for nourishing the kidneys.\n\nNow, calling the nurturing of the heart the **female gate**,\nit is because the **Dao/Way** values stillness—\npreserving the spirit and safeguarding the essence.\n\nConcentrating the spirit and gathering the **qi**,\nthe **Dao/Way** values gentleness.\n\nEmptiness of the spirit to receive the **qi**,\nthe **Dao/Way** values humility.\n\nGuarding the spirit and awaiting the **qi**,\nthe **Dao/Way** values frailty.\n\nUsing the spirit to interact with the **qi**,\nthe **Dao/Way** values submission.\n\nHarmonizing the spirit and **qi**,\nthe **Dao/Way** values accord.\n\nThe **female Dao** (牝道) possesses the six **virtues/powers** (德) of stillness, gentleness, humility, frailty, submission, and accord,\nthus borrowing the name **female gate** to metaphorically replace the Yellow Court—\nnot shifting the gate’s location to the Yellow Court’s realm.\n\nFamilies of *Dan Tian* cultivation often reverse the symbols of hexagrams and lines,\nfrequently lending names to one another.\n\nTo speak plainly, the **Returning Dao** (回道) further elucidates this:\nEach phrase holds a true secret,\nsweeping away a thousand metaphors.\n\nHold it as treasure—\ndo not reveal it to the unworthy.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two**\n(*River Above Master’s Commentary* treats this as the **Dao/Way** chapter; *Peng’s* version as **Dao/Way’s profound secrets**)\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is the profound mystery of all things.\nA treasure for the virtuous,\na safeguard for the unvirtuous.\nFine words can be sold,\nnoble deeds can be bestowed upon others.\nWhat can be discarded from the unvirtuous?\nThus, the establishment of the Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes,\neven with a jade tablet to precede the four horses,\nis not as beneficial as sitting and mastering this **Dao/Way**.\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this **Dao/Way** in such esteem?\nWas it not because:\none who seeks it shall obtain it,\nand one who holds it shall be absolved of guilt?\n\nThus, it is held as precious throughout the world.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is the profound mystery of all things—\nthe origin of creation and transformation.\n\nThe virtuous treasure it highly,\nusing it to cultivate the elixir and attain sainthood.\nThe unvirtuous also preserve it,\nfor it can replenish their **qi** and prolong their years.\nThis is the **Dao/Way’s** utmost fairness.\n\nTo speak of this **Dao/Way**,\none can attract followers as readily as selling goods.\nTo practice this **Dao/Way** with honor,\none can elevate others by a rank.\nThis is the **Dao/Way’s** never-failing reward.\n\nThose in the world who forsake this **Dao/Way** and rush blindly—\nthey themselves are unvirtuous;\nthe **Dao/Way** has never abandoned anyone.\nThus, even with the Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes as noble persons,\nand the jade tablet and four horses as noble things,\nwhen compared to this **Dao/Way**,\nsitting and mastering it remains the most precious.\n*Sitting*: guarding. (See *Zuo Zhuan*: \"The Chu people sat at their northern gate\" for this usage.)\nAlso, *sitting*: kneeling. (See *Qu Li*: \"When sitting, one must shift\" for this usage.)\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this **Dao/Way** in such esteem?\nBecause seeking it brings attainment,\nand attaining it absolves one from guilt.\nThus, nothing in the world is as precious as this.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three**\n(*River Above Master’s Commentary* treats this as the **En/beginning** chapter; *Peng’s* version as the **Great** chapter)\n\nTo act without acting,\nto manage without managing,\nto savor the insipid.\nGreat and small, many and few—\nrepay resentment with **virtue/power**,\nplanning the difficult in its ease,\nachieving the great through the minute.\nThe world’s difficult tasks\nmust begin with what is easy.\nThe world’s great undertakings\nmust begin with what is small.\nThus, the sage never seeks to do what is great,\nand so can accomplish the great.\n\nLight promises bring few fulfillments,\nmany trivialities bring many hardships.\nTherefore, the sage treats even the difficult as difficult,\nand so ultimately faces no difficulty.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Four**\nTo act without acting is to act in tranquility,\nto manage without managing is to manage in stillness,\nto savor the insipid is to savor in simplicity—\nall pointing to serene detachment.\n\nGreat and small, many and few—\nto measure things and apply them evenly.\nTo repay resentment with **virtue/power** means\nto respond in kind, repaying **virtue/power** with **virtue/power**,\nnot adding excess.\n\nTo plan the difficult in its ease means\nthat where others find things light,\nI alone regard them as difficult—\nnot that difficulty follows ease,\nbut that I treat what is easy as difficult.\n\nTo achieve the great through the minute means\nnot to belittle small actions,\nlest they accumulate into great **virtue/power**.\nThis aligns with the text’s words:\nThus, the world’s difficult tasks\nmust begin with what is easy.\nThe world’s great undertakings\nmust begin with what is small.\nThis should now be clear.\n\nTo begin with what is easy\nis to guard against recklessness in trivial matters.\nTo begin with what is small\nis to value small actions from the start.\n\nThe sage never seeks to do what is great,\nand so can accomplish the great.\nThis further clarifies\nthat great undertakings must begin with the small.\n\nAs for beginning with what is easy,\nanother argument is made to explain it:\nOne who makes light promises\nwill surely lack trustworthiness.\nThus, those who speak much of trivialities\nwill inevitably face many hardships.\nTherefore, even what is not difficult,\nthe sage treats as difficult,\nand so ultimately faces no difficulty.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Five**\nWhat is stable is easy to uphold;\nwhat has not yet manifested is easy to plan.\nWhat is fragile is easy to shatter;\nwhat is subtle is easy to disperse.\nAct before things exist,\ngovern before chaos arises.\n\nA tree thick as a man’s embrace\nbegins as a sprout.\nA nine-tiered tower\nrises from a pile of soil.\nA thousand-li journey\nbegins with a single step.\n\nThose who act invite ruin;\nthose who grasp lose hold.\nThe sage acts without acting,\nand so knows no ruin.\nHolds without grasping,\nand so knows no loss.\n\nThe common folk, in their undertakings,\noften ruin what is nearly complete.\nTo be as cautious at the end as at the beginning\nis to know no failure.\n\nThus, the sage desires without desiring—\ndesires the Dao but does not covet rare treasures.\nLearns without learning—\nlearns method but remains effortlessly natural—\nturning back the errors of the masses,\naiding the spontaneous order of all things,\nand daring not to act.\n\nAs the first fifty-seven chapters state:\n*\"I act without acting, and the people transform themselves.\nI love stillness, and the people align themselves.\nI act without acting, and the people grow rich.\nI desire nothing, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\nThis is the same principle.\n\nThe ancient masters of the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people,\nbut rather to keep them simple.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern\nbecause their cleverness is too great.\nTo govern with cleverness is the ruin of the state;\nto govern without cleverness is the state’s blessing.\n\nTo know these two principles\nis to grasp the standard.\nTo grasp the standard\nis called *Mystic Virtue*.\n\nMystic Virtue is profound, vast,\ncontrary to the ways of things,\nand reaches the Great Harmony.\n\nThe Dao does not value knowledge and discernment,\nfor they diminish its primal unity;\nit values ignorance and oblivion,\nto preserve its nameless essence.\n\nThus, the master of the Dao does not seek to enlighten the people,\nbut rather to keep them simple.\n\n*\"The people are difficult to govern because their cleverness is too great.\"*\nThis is what was said before:\n*\"When wisdom arises, great deceit follows.\"*\n\n*\"To govern with cleverness is the ruin of the state.\"*\nThis is what was said before:\n*\"When governance is meticulous, the people grow weary.\"*\n\n*\"To govern without cleverness is the state’s blessing.\"*\nThis is what was said before:\n*\"Abandon the sage, discard wisdom—the people’s gain is a hundredfold.\"*\n\nWisdom and lack of wisdom—\nthese two determine the state’s prosperity or ruin,\nand serve as the model for governance.\n\nIf one knows this,\nthen one may be called *Mystic Virtue*.\n\n*Mystic Virtue*—\nits depths are vast, its light far-reaching,\nits simplicity not simple,\ncontrary to the blind striving of all things.\n\n*Great Harmony*—\nthe Great Transformation.\n\nThus, *Mystic Virtue* alone may attain the Great Transformation.\n\nThe rivers and seas are able to be the sovereign of all valleys because they excel in yielding to them—thus they become the sovereign of all valleys.\n\nTherefore, the Sage, wishing to be above others, must speak in humility.\nWishing to lead others, must place himself behind them.\n\nThus, the Sage, though in high station, is not held in awe,\nthough in the forefront, does not cause harm.\n\nTherefore, the world willingly follows and never tires,\nfor he does not contend—\nthus none under heaven can contend with him.\n\nThe rivers and seas excel in yielding,\nand all currents flow to them,\nhence they are called the sovereign of all valleys—\nto illustrate the Sage.\n\nTo be above the people yet speak in humility—\nthis is what was said before:\n*\"The lofty relies on the low as its foundation.\"*\n\nTo lead others yet place oneself behind—\nthis is what was said before:\n*\"Retreat one’s self, yet one’s self is foremost.\"*\n\nThus, the Sage’s virtue is pure and harmonious,\nin high station without the terror of coercive might,\nand the people do not feign reverence.\nIn the forefront without the aggression of overbearing *qi*,\nand the people do not guard against harm.\n\nTherefore, the world willingly acclaims the Sage,\ndelighting without surfeit.\nNone can contend with him—\nfor the Sage, like the rivers and seas, excels in yielding,\nand all currents cannot divide his influence.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seventh**\n*(He Shang Gong’s annotation: \"Chapter on the Three Treasures\"; Peng’s text agrees.)*\n\nThe world all says I am great—\nyet it seems I am not so.\nFor only the truly great\nappear to be not great.\nIf one seems great,\nlong has it been small!\n\nI have three treasures, hold them close.\nFirst is **compassion (慈)**, second is **frugality (俭)**,\nthird is not daring to act before all under heaven.\n**Compassion** makes one courageous,\n**frugality** makes one capacious,\nnot daring to act before all under heaven\nmakes one a vessel of lasting worth.\n\nNow, if one abandons **compassion** for courage,\none must have a heart of endurance.\nIf one abandons **frugality** for capaciousness,\none must have a heart of greed.\nIf one abandons humility for precedence,\none must have a heart of contention.\nAll these are paths to death.\n\n**Compassion** in battle brings victory,\nin defense brings security.\nWhen Heaven intends to save one,\nit does so through **compassion** as a shield.\n**Compassion** is the great Dao indeed!\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty-Eighth**\n*(He Shang Gong’s annotation: \"Chapter on Aligning with Heaven\"; Peng’s text agrees.)*\nThe adept at being a **scholar-official (士)** does not rely on force.\nThe adept at war does not rage in anger.\nThe adept at overcoming the enemy does not vie in contention.\nThe adept at using others places himself beneath them.\nThis is called the virtue of **non-contention (不争之德)**,\nthis is called the strength of using others,\nthis is called the ancient extreme of aligning with Heaven.\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty-Ninth**\n*(He Shang Gong’s annotation: \"Chapter on Mysterious Application\"; Peng’s annotation: \"Chapter on Lightly Treating the Enemy\")*\nIn wielding arms, there is a saying:\n*\"I dare not

without arms.\nNo calamity is greater than lightly treating the enemy—\nlightly treating the enemy nearly forfeits my treasures.\nThus, when forces clash and are matched,\nthe **merciful (哀)** will prevail.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seventieth**\n*(He Shang Gong’s annotation: \"Chapter on Knowing Difficulty\"; Peng’s annotation: \"Chapter on Knowing Self\")*\nTo wield arms, one must say:\n*\"I do not

drawn bow, its essence is simply balance and equilibrium.\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised, so the two arms are level.\nThe overabundant are diminished, the insufficient are supplemented, so the body stands upright.\nThe Dao of Heaven harmonizes the seven **zhèng** (political offices) and orders the five **xíng** (types of conduct), achieving its wondrous regulation through balance and equilibrium.\nHence, it is also said: *\"The Dao of Heaven diminishes the overabundant and supplements the insufficient.\"*\n\nBut the Dao of man is otherwise—\nit diminishes the insufficient to serve the overabundant,\nthus making the insufficient even more so,\nand the overabundant even more so.\nWho could use their own overabundance to serve the insufficient of all under Heaven?\nOnly those who

upon it,\ndiminish the overabundant to serve all under Heaven,\nyet do not claim the virtue as their own—\nis this not because they do not reveal their own virtue?\n\nThe vulgar annotation in verse says:\n*\"The Dao of Heaven diminishes excess and accepts humility to bring benefit,\nwhile human nature consumes and depletes, worsening misfortune evermore.*\nIf one can grasp the meaning of the scripture,\nthe sand elixir and the gold elixir will unite with the sacred lineage of the Dao.\n\nThe **Tàishàng** speaks in terms of the readily apparent.\n\nThe opening three lines echo what was previously stated: *\"The utmost gentleness under Heaven, galloping through the utmost firmness under Heaven.\"* Without anything to replace it, meaning no other substance can surpass this in overcoming firmness. Though all under Heaven know the principle that *gentleness overcomes strength and softness overcomes hardness*, none can put it into practice.\n\nTherefore, the **Tàishàng** further cites the words of the sages to illustrate the profound virtue of gentleness: *\"To bear the filth of the state is called the guardian of the ancestral altars. To bear the misfortunes of the state is called the ruler of all under Heaven.\"* His words are upright yet seem contrary, for the sages take upon themselves the blame, saying: *\"I truly bear much guilt—what crime has the people committed? My virtue is thin and shallow; Heaven has sent this calamity upon me.\"* Their upright words appear reversed because they seek blame within themselves rather than pointing it outward at others. This is indeed the Dao of gentleness.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Ninth** (*River Master’s commentary originally titled \"Tasking Trust\" [任契], Peng’s text the same*)\n*\"When great grudges are reconciled, there will still be lingering grudges.\nHow can this be considered good?\nThus, the sages hold the left contract but do not blame the people.\nThose with virtue manage the contract, those without manage the fulfillment.\nThe Dao of Heaven has no favorites, always favoring those who are good.\"*\n\nIf the realm has many grudges, the ruler’s virtue must be shallow. If one meets the people’s grudges yet still does not blame oneself, but instead wishes to reconcile the great grudges, then even if some grudges are reconciled, there will still be those that remain unreconciled, and lingering grudges cannot be easily dispelled. How can this be called complete goodness?\n\nConfucius said: *\"If one is generous to oneself yet sparing in blaming others, one will be far from grudges.\"* Therefore, the sages govern the world by cultivating the virtue of self-generosity, gaining the people’s trust, and not blaming them—so the people naturally come to trust them. It is like sealing a covenant, dividing the contract into halves, each party holding their own, forever relying upon it. Then neither deceives the other, nor does one suspect the other.\n\nIf the sages uphold virtue as if holding the left contract, who among the people would not be delighted? Thus, those with virtue manage the contract, and those without manage the fulfillment.\n\nFulfillment (*彻*): means to examine faults. Those who obsessively examine faults, never reflecting upon themselves, will not be followed by the people. The Dao of Heaven has no favorites, always favoring those who are good. As the *Book of Documents* says: *\"The august Heaven has no favorites; reverence earns its favor. The people have no constant hearts; hearts turn toward those with kindness.\"*\n\n**Chapter Eightieth** (*River Master’s commentary originally titled \"Standing Alone\" [独立], Peng’s text titled \"Small States\"*)\n*\"Small states, few people.\nLet them possess the implements of ten or a hundred households yet not use them.\nLet them value death so much that they do not move far.\nThough they have boats and carriages, there is no need to ride them.\nThough they have armor and weapons, there is no need to display them.\nLet them return to knotting cords for record-keeping.\nLet them find their food sweet, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, their customs joyful.\nNeighboring states are in sight, the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard,\nYet the people live to old age and die without visiting one another.\"*\n\nThere are those who wish to make their states great and their populations numerous, possessing the implements of ten billion or a hundred million households yet not using them—then their use will only grow more extravagant. The **Tàishàng** does not follow this path. Instead, he uses the small to illustrate the great, showing that the small can encompass the great.\n\nIn a small state with few people, if they possess the implements of ten or a hundred households yet do not use them, their use will only become more abundant. What difficulty is there in returning to simplicity and purity? Therefore, he lets the people not use their implements, cherishing only their lives. They dwell in their native land, do not migrate to other regions. They value death yet do not die, nurturing life to prolong it—what else is there to seek?\n\nAt this time, the people within the state move with ease and vigor, so there is no need for boats or carriages. Within the state’s borders, thieves and bandits are nonexistent, so there is no need for armor or weapons. The governance of the state is pure and substantial, so the custom of knotting cords can be revived. The food is sweet, the clothing fine, the dwellings secure, and the customs joyful. Neighboring states are in sight, the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard, yet the people live to old age and die without visiting one another—then their interactions are simple and unburdened by extravagance, their provisions abundant yet each remains content in their own home.\n\nThe high-minded of the state say:\n*\"A single hill and valley suffice—we deem it better than the world beyond.\nA single spring and autumn pass in ease, as if forgotten within a pot.*\nGrandfathers and grandmothers live in lasting health,\nHusbands and wives grow old together in harmony.\nBrothers and sisters play on the *xūn* and *zhé*,\nChildren and grandchildren harmonize the *luán* and *hè*.\nWhat difference is there from the blessed lands of the immortals, the realm of Ultimate Bliss?\"*\n\n**Chapter Eighty-First**\n*\"Trustworthy words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not trustworthy.\nThe good do not argue; those who argue are not good.\nThe wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\nThe sages do not accumulate.\nWhen they act for others, their own virtue grows greater;\nWhen they give to others, their own abundance increases.\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming.\nThe Dao of the sages acts without striving.\"*\n\nTrust, goodness, and wisdom—all pertain to upright speech, summarizing the entire *Sutra*’s meaning. Sincere and substantial discourse is true alone, not adorned with empty flourishes to please the world. Those who seek to please the world rely on empty flourishes, not sincerity—hence it is said: *\"Trustworthy words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not trustworthy.\"*\n\nContinuing the fine tradition, it is uprightness alone, not engaging in sophistry to confuse others. Those who confuse others rely on sophistry, not on upholding tradition—hence it is said: *\"The good do not argue; those who argue are not good.\"*\n\nDiscourse that penetrates to its depths is one principle alone, not indulging in superficiality to display talent. Those who display talent indulge in superficiality, not depth—hence it is said: *\"The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\"*\n\nAnd yet, it follows with establishing virtue and deeds, fulfilling the grand purpose of this *Sutra*. Accumulation means accumulating goodness. The sages do not speak of accumulating goodness; they only establish their own great virtue and great deeds. Their virtue and deeds are boundless and universal, so when they act for others, their own virtue and deeds only grow greater.\n\nThe more one gives virtue and merit to others, the more one’s own virtue and merit abound.\n\nThe Dao thrives through silent operation, hence it brings benefit but inflicts no harm. The sages’ Dao rests in effortless transformation, their hearts devoid of striving; they do not vie with others in amassing good deeds or reputation, so their greatness aligns with Heaven’s. The ancients said: *\"The highest excellence lies in establishing virtue, the next in establishing deeds, the next in establishing words. All three are imperishable.\"* This may be applied to what is spoken here.\n\nAfter completing his annotation of this *Sutra*, the Master of Emptiness’ conduct and speech harmonized with its teachings, as if he had studied it repeatedly. He claimed that without uttering a single word, he could reveal the true essence of the Way.\n\nThe concluding chapter, which speaks of virtue and merit as its final annotation, he also deemed most beautiful and good.\n\nThen, he pondered how the phrase *\"Act without contention\"* could serve as the root for all eighty-one chapters. Suddenly, he realized: *\"Yes, yes! This single sentence alone suffices as the sovereign grain of the entire *Sutra*.\"*\n\nWhat practitioners fear is hearing the Dao yet still engaging in petty strife for minor merit, minor virtue, trifling literary fame, or chasing after fleeting wealth and honors—thus exhausting their precious, useful lives in vain pursuits.\n\nThe sages’ Dao mirrors the Way of Heaven; Heaven’s Dao governs spontaneous transformation, naturally bringing benefit while inflicting no harm. The sages’ Dao encompasses effortless transformation—is it not also benefit without harm?\n\nI wish those who achieve their aims and fulfill their names, who exhaust filial piety and perfect loyalty, would all take refuge in the True and all attain the Dao. First, they refine themselves with jade-like purity, dwelling in great seclusion among the marketplace. Next, they forge their merit with gold-like precision, dwelling deeply in ravines and valleys. Internally, they exhaust their own efforts; externally, they sever all striving and contention.\n\nFor only by not contending does one ensure that none in the world can contend with them—such is the perfected sage.\n\nThe sacred scriptures’ grand conclusion is consummate indeed.\n\n**The True Transmission of Laozi**\nLaozi was a man of Chu.\nHis father, **Ganyuan Gao**, served as the **Shang** (or **Zhou**) court’s **Grand Historian**.\nHe wed **Hongshi**, whose given name was **Yingfu**.\nOne day, while napping, he beheld five-colored cloud radiance enveloping **Taiyi LaoJun**, who descended from the heavens, then suddenly transformed into a shooting star and flew into his mouth.\nThereafter, he conceived a **jewel embryo**, and twelve years later gave birth in **Kuh County’s** **Lai Village**, **Qu Ren Lane**, beneath a **plum tree**.\nTaking the plum as his surname, he was called **Laozi** because he was born from the **LaoJun** vision, **Zhong’er** for his long ears, and **Baiyang Fu** by his title.\nThis occurred on the **fifteenth day of the third month, Year One of Shang King Wu Ding**.\n\n(*As recorded in the **Scriptures of the Transcendent** and **Records of the Path**. The **Inner Transmission** states: “Surname Li, given name Er. His mother saw the **sun’s essence** descend like a shooting star, entering her mouth, and thus conceived. Carrying him for seventy-two years, she gave birth beside the **Huo River** in **Chen State**, beneath a plum tree. Pointing to the plum, she declared, ‘This shall be my lineage.’ Born with white hair, he was thus called **Laozi**. With three ear leaks, he was also called **Lao Dan**.” The **Five Schools’ Web of Fate** says: “Surname Li, given name **Zai**, born on the **fourteenth day of the ninth month, Dingwei Year** of **King Ding**.” The **Expanded Lunar Ordinances** recount: “The **Jade Maiden**, Laozi’s mother, dreamed of five-colored cloud radiance coalescing into a pearl, which flew into her mouth. Swallowing it, she conceived. After eighty-one years, she gave birth beneath a **sacred grove tree**, emerging from her left armpit. This too occurred on the fifteenth day of the third month, Year One of Wu Ding.”*)\n\n「The *Suoyou Qianliang Lu* records: *“In the year **Qianyuan** of the **Dingwei** cycle, **Li Zai** conceived for seventy-two years without a husband. He was born from a union with his neighbor, **Yishou**.”*\n\nThe *Xuyang Zalu* recounts: *“Laozi’s mother, the **Yuanjun** (Primordial Lady), was impregnated when **day-precision** (solar essence) entered her mouth, which she swallowed. Thus, she carried him for seventy-two years before giving birth.”*\n\nLiu Xie’s *Xin Lun* states: *“Laozi was conceived through the influence of the **Fire Star** (Mars).”*\n\nThe *Lushi* (Chronicles of History) says: *“A **flowing star** (meteor) struck him, and after twelve years, he was born. From birth, he could speak, with a **yellow face** and **radiant white hair**, hence the name **Laozi**. He was from **Lai Village** in **Kuxian** (Bitter County), where *Lai* is a variant of *Le*, thus he was also called **Lao Lezi** (Old Le).”*\n\nThe *Gaoshi Zhuan* (Biographies of the High Worthies) notes: *“Laozi was born during the **Shang Dynasty** (Yin era).”*\n\nThe *Shenxian Zhuan* (Biographies of Immortals) states: *“Laozi, also named **Zhong’er** (Middle Son), was conceived when his mother was struck by a **great flowing star** (meteor). Some say she carried him for seventy-two years before giving birth. Others claim his mother had no husband, and **Li** was her family name. Still others say his mother, while passing beneath a **plum tree**, conceived and gave birth. From birth, he could speak, pointing to the plum tree and declaring, ‘This shall be my surname.’”*\n\nThe *Lieshen Zhuan* (Biographies of the Immortals) recounts: *“Laozi entered his mother’s womb riding a **white deer**.”*\n\nThe *Tang Ji* (Tang Records) says: *“Laozi’s mother ate a **plum** and conceived. Her parents abandoned her, and after eighty years, she gave birth beneath a **plum tree**. The **Tang Emperor Gaozu** traced his lineage to Laozi, hence the term **Xian Li Pan Gen** (Ineffable Plum Root).”*\n\nThe *Zalu* (Miscellaneous Notes) notes: *“**Xuanyao Yufu** (Mysterious and Marvelous Jade Maiden), descended from **heavenly yellow-black qi** (vital essence), entered her mouth and conceived. After three thousand seven hundred years, she was born in the **Western Thatagata Kingdom**—this is the tale of **Daode Tianzun** (The Celestial Venerable of Virtue and Way), not Laozi.”»\n\nOf **innate purity and filial piety**, he relied on the **common folk’s transformation** (cultivation).\n\n「In his lifetime, he was serene and simple, devoid of desire—externally rejecting wealth and honor, internally nurturing his **jing** and **qi** (vital essence and vital energy). During the transition between the Shang and Zhou dynasties, he endured for over a hundred years without decline, and was then known as the **Ancient Hidden Sage** (古隐君子). The *Shiji* (Records of the Grand Historian) states: *“He lived to over a hundred and sixty years, or some say over two hundred. Zhi Chuan (稚川) says: ‘Laozi lived in the Zhou for over three hundred years.’”* The *Lushi* (Chronicles of the Path) records: *“His mother lived to four hundred and forty years, or some say two hundred and twenty.”* The *Guangji* (Comprehensive Records) says: *“Two hundred and seventy years.”* The *Shantang Sikao* (Hall of Mountains' Four Examinations) notes: *“He was born in the reign of Shang Emperor Wu Ding, and lived until the ninth year of Qin Emperor Shihuang, spanning nine hundred and ninety-six years.”* Calculating from Wu Ding’s first year to Shihuang’s ninth year, his actual lifespan was one thousand and eighty-seven years. Laozi often changed his name during the Zhou era.\n\nIn the time of King Wen (文王), he was known as **Xieyi Zi** (燮邑子, also written as **Zhiyou Shixian** 支邑先生), serving as the **Keeper of the Archives** (守藏史). In the time of King Wu (武王), he was called **Yucheng Zi** (育成子), serving as the **Chief Historian** (柱下史). During King Kang’s reign (康王), he was known as **Guochu Zi** (郭叔子), and in King Xian’s time (顷王), he was called **Lao Lezi** (老莱子). His wife was also virtuous and wise, and together they retired in farming and sericulture (耕桑). He wrote fifteen treatises, expounding the **practical applications of Daoism** (道家之用). When King Zhuang of Chu (楚庄王) heard of them, he sought his counsel. At the time, Lao Lezi was weaving, and the king approached and asked: *“I wish to govern my kingdom well—would you, Master, assist me?”* Lao Lezi replied: *“Agreed.”* The king then left.」\n\nHis wife returned from gathering firewood and asked, *“Did you agree to his request?”* He replied, *“Indeed.”* His wife said, *“I have heard: ‘Those whom you may feed with wine and meat, you may also strike with rods and clubs. Those whom you may grant office and emolument, you may also execute with axes and cleavers.’ I cannot be made a tool of others.”* She cast aside her basket and departed. Lao Lezi, delighted, immediately fled with his wife.\n\nSima Qian records: *“Laozi’s son was named Zong, who served as a general in Wei and was ennobled at Duan. Zong’s son was Wang. Wang’s son was Yan. Yan’s great-great-grandson was Xia, who served in the Han. Xia’s son Jie became tutor to the King of Jiaoxi, residing in Qi.”* At the time, the generations of ancestors and descendants must have wandered without fixed abode, their lineages branching and diverging. Some say: In Yue, he was Fan Li; in Qi, he was Yuyi; in Wu, he was Tao Zhu Gong; in the early Han, he was Huangshi Gong; during Emperor Wen’s reign, he was He Shang Gong—these are all matters beyond verification.\n\nGe Zichuan remarked: *“Laozi emerged in every age, often changing his name. The reason for this is that, according to the *Nine Palaces*, the *Three-Five Canon*, and the *Elemental Period Canon*, each person encounters critical junctures in life. When such times arrive, one must change one’s name to align with the shifts in primordial *qi*, thereby transcending calamity and prolonging life. Even in the present age, many Daoists do the same. Laozi remained in Zhou for over a hundred years, passing through multiple such junctures, hence his many names. To establish Laozi’s true origins, we must rely primarily on historical records and his own secret scriptures, cross-referencing them. Other folk accounts are largely baseless.”*\n\nMoreover, the *Western Ascension: Middle Embryo*, *The Return of the Mandate: The Wrapped*, *Pearl Stratagem and Jade Mechanism*, and the *Golden Canon: Inner Classic* all describe Laozi as having white-yellow skin, beautiful brows and broad forehead, long ears and large eyes, sparse teeth and square mouth, thick lips, and a forehead marked with three to five enlightened lines. His horns resembled the sun’s rays, his eyebrows hung like the moon, his nose was straight with twin pillars, his ears had three apertures, his feet stepped upon the numbers two and five, and his hands grasped ten symbols. He stood nine *chi* tall, with teeth numbering sixty-four—these were the outward signs of a sage.\n\nThose who receive the Mandate of Heaven inherently possess divine insight and foresight, differing from common mortals. They are the masters of the Dao, thus able to be aided by celestial beings and followed by immortals. Hence, the teachings he transmitted to save the world amounted to nine hundred thirty volumes, along with seventy volumes of talismans—all recorded in the central chapters of his original scriptures. The catalogues remain, and their authenticity can be verified. Those texts not included in this count were later additions by Daoist practitioners, not genuine works (as noted by Zichuan).\n\nLaozi cultivated effortlessly, refining himself through stillness (as recorded in the *Shiji*). He devoted himself entirely to longevity, yet though he remained in Zhou for centuries, his rank and status never advanced. He sought to blend his light with the mundane, his essence remaining naturally true. Only when his Dao was complete did he depart—he was indeed an immortal (*Shenxian Zhuan*).\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Zhou, he intended to inquire about ritual from Laozi. Laozi said, *“What you speak of—both the person and their bones—have long since decayed, yet their words endure. Moreover, a noble seeks to ride the times; if the times do not favor them, they travel lightly like a tumbleweed. I have heard: ‘A wise merchant conceals their wealth as if empty; a virtuous person’s excellence appears as folly.’ Abandon your arrogance and greed, your vain demeanor and licentious desires—for these bring no benefit to your life.”*\n\nLater, he asked Confucius, *“Have you attained the Dao?”*\n\nConfucius said, *“I have sought it for twenty-seven years and have not yet attained it.”*\n\nLaozi replied, *“If the Dao could be presented to others, then all would offer it to their lords. If the Dao could be advanced upon others, then all would advance it to their kin. If the Dao could be told to others, then all would tell it to their brothers. If the Dao could be transmitted to others, then all would transmit it to their children. Yet it cannot be so—there is no inner master to dwell within the Dao.”*\n\nWhen Confucius spoke to Laozi of *ren* and *yi*, Laozi said, *“Scatter chaff in the eyes, and the four directions shift. A gnat’s sting on the skin, and one cannot sleep the whole night. Now *ren* and *yi* are harsh and violent—they agitate my heart and mind, and no chaos is greater. My wish is that the world not lose its natural simplicity, that it move with the wind and stand firm in virtue, returning naturally to its origin. Why must you strive so ostentatiously, as if carrying a great drum to seek a lost child? The wild goose does not bathe daily to become white; the crow does not blacken itself daily to become black. Black and white in their simplicity are insufficient to distinguish beauty and ugliness. Unpraised observation is insufficient to expand one’s true nature. Fish left in a dried-up spring cling together on land, moistening each other with breath, nourishing each other with spittle—yet it is not as good as forgetting each other in the vast rivers and lakes.”*\n\nConfucius then said to Laozi, *“I have studied the *Odes*, the *Book of Documents*, the *Rites*, the *Music*, the *Symbols of the Yi*, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, and with these I have served seventy-two lords.”*\n\n「Discussing the *Dao* of the ancient kings, yet clarifying the traces of the Zhou and Chou rulers, one sovereign finds no practical use for it—how profound! How difficult it is to speak of humans, and how difficult it is to elucidate the *Dao*!」\n\nLaozi replied, *“The Six Classics are but the relics of the ancient kings—how could they be the means by which the *Dao* was practiced? What you speak of now are all mere traces. For traces are what the foot leaves behind, yet traces are not the feet themselves.”*\n\nConfucius returned, and for three days did not speak. Zigong wondered and asked him, *“Master, why is this so?”* Confucius said, *“I know that birds can fly, fish can swim, and beasts can run. Those that run can be caught in nets, those that swim can be reeled with lines, and those that fly can be snared with arrows. But as for the dragon, I do not know how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend to the ninth heaven. Now, seeing Laozi—is he not like the dragon?”*\n\nLaozi dwelled in Zhou for a long time, but seeing the decline of Zhou’s *virtue/power*, he ascended a green ox-cart and departed westward through the Qin Pass, ascending to Kunlun. The Pass Overseer Yin Xi observed a purple vapor and, foreknowing his arrival, swept the road for forty *li* to welcome him. When Laozi indeed arrived, Yin Xi said, *“Master, you are about to depart in seclusion—please, for me, write down your teachings.”* So he halted his cart in the pass and composed *The Dao and Virtue* in over five thousand words, imparting all to Yin Xi before departing.\n\nDuring the Eastern Han era, there was a descendant of the Wang family in Qingzhou, named Cheng, with the courtesy name Xuanfu, and the *Dao* name Donghua. He encountered the Kunlun Western Mother, Wang Qitian Zhu. Zhu, delighted by their shared surname, bestowed upon him the title Baiyun Shangzhen and gave him Laozi’s green talisman of jade seals and the golden sacred scriptures. Xuanfu devoted himself to these teachings for three years, diligently practicing without ceasing. Moved by his sincerity, Laozi descended and condensed *The Inner Landscape of the Yellow Court* into one volume, naming it *The Outer Landscape*, which he entrusted to Xuanfu for cultivation, also revealing the fire preparation methods for the nine-refinement, eight-essence elixir. Xuanfu then concealed his light and obscured his traces, building a hermitage to quietly refine his practice. When his efforts were complete, he was titled *Donghua Emperor*, overseeing the *qi* of the Eastern Minor Yang.\n\nHe was also called *Zifu Minor Yang*, the Great Emperor of Fushang, and the Lord of the Ministerial Assistants. Through three successive transmissions, he reached Chunyang Master, who declared: *“Laozi’s* Outer Landscape *and Yuzhen’s* Inner Landscape *are both stored in the Fushang Palace. Donghua’s ancestor praised and passed them down, recording Laozi’s intention to guide the world. The* Dao *of the Old Lord before and Laozi after—are they one or two? They are harmonious yet distinct.”*\n\nIn ancient times, Laozi’s previous incarnation was the embodiment of the *Dao* of the Supreme Old Lord (Laojun). Thus, his transformations between concealment and revelation mirrored those of the Old Lord. The Old Lord in the Upper Antiquity manifested as the Three Pure Ones. During the reign of Tianhuang, he was named the Heavenly Teacher of Ten Thousand Laws; during Dihuang, the Mysterious Middle Teacher of the Law; during Renhuang, the Firm Master. After the Three Sovereigns, he became the Golden Threshold Emperor. In the time of Fu Xi, he was called Yuxiazi (later changed to Yumi). In the time of Shennong, he was the Nine-Spirited Laozi. During the reign of Emperor Ku, he was Lutuzzi. In the time of Yao, he was Wuchengzi. In the time of Shun, he was Yinshouzi. In the time of Xia Yu, he was Zhenxingzi. In the time of Shang Tang, he was Xizezi. It was only during the reign of Shang’s Wuding that he descended fully as Laozi. This was another epoch of cosmic transformation, a new beginning for heaven and earth.\n\nLater scholars, unaware of this, conflated Laozi with Laojun, thus attributing the previous incarnation’s deeds to his later life. Some claimed Laozi was born before heaven and earth, while others asserted he was the essence of heaven. Such assertions leave even the most meticulous scholars in disbelief, beyond the *Laojun’s Authentic Scripture*. *The Master Who Embrace Simplicity* states: *“If one possesses the* Dao *of heaven, then one has the arts of the* Dao*. The practitioners of the* Dao *have existed since the time of Xī and Huāng, through to the Three Dynasties. Why must it always be one Laozi?”* This arises from later disciples who favor the strange and unusual, seeking to elevate Laozi’s status. In truth, Laozi was simply an extraordinary master of the *Dao*, not a supernatural figure.\n\nIf one claims Laozi attained the *Dao*, then people must strive to emulate him. If one claims he was a supernatural being, then longevity becomes unattainable through learning. In my humble view, Laojun before was supernatural, while Laozi later shared the same path as others. The supernatural cannot be learned, but the path shared by all can be. The core intent of Laozi’s teachings is simply this: to rely on truth.\n\nThe Confucian scholars say that the birth of sages is due to human *qi* receiving heavenly essence—this is the most plausible explanation. Laozi’s birth borrowed the Four Great Elements to form his shape; through rigorous cultivation, he achieved grand deeds, becoming the model for immortals and the exemplar of *Dao* and *virtue*. When his merits were fulfilled and his practice complete, he returned to oversee all the heavens. Divided into myriad forms, yet unified as one. He descended as a mortal, but both his divine and human aspects centered on cultivating the *Dao*—what cannot be learned lies here, and what can be learned also lies here.\n\nAs for Zhuangzi and Fang Shuo, their claims that Laozi merely changed his name are untrustworthy; these were indeed Laozi’s own bestowals. The *Treasure of Praise* states:\n*“Descendants like those of the Lacquer Garden and Fang Shuo—\nthey meticulously dissect the faintest radiance.\nIt is as if the mother of Dan Yang\ndreamed of receiving divine seals from an immortal,\nthus giving birth to the great sage’s talent.”*\n\nThe *Dao* transmissions say:\n*“Those who follow Laozi’s teachings\nare pure and tranquil, without contention with the world,\nthus they can embrace simplicity while harboring preciousness,\nnever facing adversity in a perilous age.”*\n\nHis origins are profound, his influence vast—\nhow could he not be the eternal exemplar set by heaven and earth?\n\nResiding on Qing Island for several years,\nhe often instructed the late disciples Zhuzi, Jiezi, and Huifeng Sizi\nwith his method of purity and stillness,\never vigilant and fearful,\nnever daring to forget his ancestral teachings.\n\nBefore there was Laojun,\nand after there was Laozi—\none in essence, two in form,\nharmonious yet clearly distinct.»\n\nHis writings are of such refined quality,\nlike the flowing waters of today and the moon’s past essence.\n\n*(The Master of Wu Mountain)* interweaves narration and commentary,\nboth as history and as solemn discourse.\n\nThe collected biographies of various schools\nall display his skill in selecting the finest and savoring the brightest.\n\nThis is the **precious transmission** of Laozi’s first chapter. *(Preserved by the Baohua sect)*",

      "translated_text": "「Master Dao Yu is now seventy, Master Dao Sheng is nearing ancient old age, and Master Dao He is no longer a youth. Within the mountains and forests, what joy could there be? Only by bearing this single commentary on the *Dao De Jing* and this one treatise of the *Nine-Layer Path* do we find delight, singing long songs in the cliffs and valleys, our voices echoing to silence the clouds of the streams. Each of us forgets our names and the cycles of time.\n\nIn the month of *Rui* (mid-autumn) of the *Zun* cycle (1899), the three recluses of Shu Mountain recognized Dao Guang’s gentle and profound essence. Pure Yang Master prefaced the *Dao De Jing*, advocating *wu wei* (non-action) in action. The *Justice* commentary elucidates without contrivance. The Dao Ancestors transmitted it, and the Dao descendants expounded upon it—thus, the Great Dao becomes ever clearer here.\n\nAmong them, there is the *Hanyuzi* (Embracing the Void), a man of transcendent talent. His *Jin Shu* (Golden Book) was revealed in dreams, born in a humble home beneath a tree. He dwells in the *Juan Shan* (卷山), passing down a tradition of sincerity and purity. The *Zai Shi* (載錫) jade tablet was indeed fitting for him. As a youth, he attained sudden enlightenment; as an adult, he practiced profound meditation. Once reading *The Outer History of the Fang Hu* (方壶外史), he secretly aspired to attain the True and enter the Mysterious, standing beside the Master Lu (陸子) at my side.\n\nI heard of him and sought him out. He introduced himself as a Daoist of *Wu Shan* (吾山), and with *Qian Xu* (潛虚), I accompanied him to observe his spirit and resolve. He resided in obscurity on the eastern slopes of *E Peak* (峨峰), serene and quiet, speaking little, unmoved by honor and profit. He often satisfied his aspirations with a single lute.\n\nAfter meeting him, I remained with him for years, during which he spoke to me of the *Heavy Mysterious* (重玄) teachings, and I understood them instantly. Thus, he exerted his talent and strength, composing *The Outer History of the Yuan Shao* (圆峤外史), a counterpart to Master Lu’s *Fang Hu* (方壶).\n\nTherefore, where Master Lu has *The Theory of Mysterious Skin* (玄肤论), here we have *The Discussion on Daoist Insights* (道窍谈); where Master Lu has *The Chapter on Rectification* (就正篇), here we have *The Treatise on Following the Dao* (循途说). These are all texts of the Clear and True Dao. Yet his most wondrous work is the commentary on the *Dao De Jing*, which is indeed a beacon for all ages, named *The Eastern Justice* (东来正义), rivaling Master Lu’s *The Supplementary Notes on the Southern Flower* (南华副墨). If these two Masters are considered, they may truly be called those who excel in discussing Laozi and Zhuangzi.\n\nNow, those who comment on this scripture have five flaws and three virtues. The five flaws are: favoring discussions of governing the world, the first. Favoring discussions of cultivating the body, the second. Some may say the Dao encompasses both body and world, yet their words lack coherence and ultimately stray into error, the third. Not understanding the true practice of the Great Dao, they first demand the people’s peace and the nation’s wealth before achieving *wu wei* (non-action), and if they immediately discuss purity and stillness, they will inevitably fall into emptiness, the fourth. Not recognizing the profound power of the Great Dao, they insist on returning to the root and obeying the command, thus counting as *you wei* (action). If they immediately discuss the sacred and divine, they will inevitably become like mere hymns, the fifth.\n\nWhat are the three virtues? The first is that his commentary aligns with the inner and outer aspects of the Dao, dividing it into primary and supplementary, thereby illuminating the scripture’s expansive meaning. The second is that his teachings are sequential and interwoven, ensuring the scripture’s principles are thoroughly connected. The third is that his heart holds true understanding, and his words are unobstructed by *Chan* (禅) barriers, allowing the scripture’s meaning to shine forth.\n\nI have often lamented that the essence of the *Dao De Jing* has not been made clear throughout the world. I wished to write a commentary to explain it, yet even now, I feel inadequate. Now, seeing *Hanyuzi*’s exposition, it possesses the three virtues without the five flaws. If his work had appeared a thousand years earlier, all other commentaries could have been unnecessary, and Daoists would not need to speak further.\n\nThus, I rejoice in presenting it and marking its significance, storing it in the sacred mountains and passing it to those of noble resolve. The purpose of my annotations is also to borrow the truth of his commentary, supplement what I have not yet explained, and demonstrate it through my own annotations.\n\n**Poem on *The Eastern Justice* (东来正义)**\nThe Revered Daoist Huizong first established the preface and commentary—\nHis own preface uniquely opens the gate to virtue.\n\nAgain, I see the Purple Qi from Guanzhong arrive,\nDirectly observing the Jade Son beneath the plum tree.\n\nHe wishes to teach the later generations to measure the Dao together,\nAnd can make the Primordial Dao yet more honored.\n\nHow many commentators lack such a foundation?\nThe treasure is long protected, guarding the Kunlun peaks.\n\n—By *Yuzhu Right Minister* (玉枢右相), *Taoqing Master of the Great Mystery* (太清洞玄校理), practicing merit and demerit, concurrently selecting matters of the Dao and the Immortal, the *Xuanxuan Daoist of Liaodong* (辽东玄玄道人), and disciple Zhang Quan Yi (侍友张全一) who inscribed this at Qingfu (青阜).\n\nOne commentary can reveal the Dao’s profound mysteries—\nAgain, I see the Purple Qi arriving from the East.\n\nStrumming the lute and playing the flute, a true gentleman,\nDiscussing the scripture and expounding the law, a master of eloquence.\n\nI dwell in the Fang Hu, playing with the boundless sea,\nYou ascend the Yuan Shao, dominating the Penglai peaks.\n\nToday, we sit together on the riverside pavilion,\nReciting the *Southern Flower* (南华) while laughing at our own folly.\n\n—By *True Scripture of the Three Pure Ones* (三清总校真函), concurrently recording the secrets of the *Tongtian* (洞天), *Master of Universal Salvation* (文明普度先生), *Eastern Dao Ancestor* (东派祖师), *Fellow of the Immortal Histories Hall* (同仙史馆), and junior disciple Lu Xixing (愚弟陆西星) who inscribed this.\n\nThe body resides in the Cloud Mountains, the Dao within oneself—\nThe depths of spirit and *qi* are most profound and mighty.\n\nAt Qingdao, the strict *Zhi* (驰) is externally practiced,\nWhile the flames are stilled in the *Dantian* (丹田), guarding the inner stillness.\n\nPeople call him the Great Abbot,\nI jokingly name him Lord of the Long Wall.\n\nLeaning on the *Dao De Jing*’s commentary and annotations,\nHis enlightenment of all scriptures is equally profound.\n\n—By *Heavenly Immortal Baiqiong Guan* (天仙白琼管) who inscribed this.\n\n**Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* (*The Eastern Justice* (东严正义))**\nWritten by the owner of the *Zixia Cave* (紫霞洞) in *Yuan Shao Mountain* (圆峤山), *Hanyuzi* (涵虚生), and perfumed by respectful dedication.\n\nPublished by Daoist disciples Zhu Dao Sheng (朱道生) and Li Dao Yu (李道育), revised at the *Yueyang Pavilion* (岳阳楼).

externally,\nso the **elixir mother** is only **external medicine**.\nThe adept **uses external medicine** to **refine internal medicine**,\nwith **mother *qi*** **concealing** the **child

To attain this *One*, one must return to the primordial.\n\nBetween before and after, there is *qi* without substance, and substance without *qi* is but an empty form. The Five Phases regard water as the *One*, for this water is the utmost of virtue and the utmost of clarity, an unfathomable power of *dharma* water. To name it \"water\" seems too forceful; to not name it \"water\" is also too void.\n\nNow let us trace back from those who attain the *One*: The Dao begins with the *One* of old. Heaven opened from old, and through the *One* it opened. Yet without this water, there would be no division—how then would its clarity be seen?\n\nEarth was divided from old, and through the *One* it was divided. Yet without this water, there would be no support—how then could its tranquility be established?\n\nThe spirit was revered from old, and through the *One* it was revered. Yet without this water, there would be no nourishment—how then could its responsiveness be illuminated?\n\nThe grain was attained from old, and through the *One* it was attained. Yet without this water, there would be no containment—how then could it aid in its abundance?\n\nAll things were formed from old, and through the *One* they were formed. Yet without this water, there would be no cultivation—how then could it provide for their flourishing?\n\nLords and kings became rulers from old, and the *One* was their ruler. Yet without this water, there would be no benefit to use—how then could they secure the stability and rectitude of the world?\n\nHeaven, Earth, spirit, grain, all things, and lords and kings—each has its own form, yet the means by which they achieve clarity, tranquility, responsiveness, abundance, flourishing, and rectitude are all through the *One*.\n\nClarity without fracture comes from pure water-*qi*.\nTranquility without upheaval comes from bearing water-*qi*.\nResponsiveness without stagnation comes from flowing water-*qi*.\nAbundance without depletion comes from filled water-*qi*.\nFlourishing without annihilation comes from nourishing water-*qi*.\nRectitude without decline—those of noble status—water’s virtue aids them, for its nature is to flow downward from lowliness.\n\nFrom ancient times, rulers who were humble yet honored have shone. Thus, nobility stems from humility, elevation from the foundation of lowliness. \"Lonely and bereft, not seeking grain\"—this self-designation of lords and kings is indeed both humble and lowly. Yet those who do not know of their wealth in the Four Seas, their nobility as Heaven’s Son, or their jade-like sustenance from all quarters—it is through this very humility of \"lonely and bereft\" that they attain these things. Is this not the grounding in humility?\n\nIn general, lords and kings who preserve their humility are truly preserving the *One*.\n\nThus, from this perspective, one may extend to all things: as in the case of the *One* driving many carriages, where the multitude is recklessly harnessed, leading to ruin without awareness. Or as with jade’s restless brilliance and stone’s detached rigidity—these show the appearance of excess.

      "translated_text": "The **Dao** of the world has an end, yet must have a beginning;\nIndeed, its beginning is not a single point.\n\n**Jīn Dān** (金丹, Golden Elixir) has:\nA place of origin, matters of practice, and substances of return.\nWhat is the place of origin?\nIt is the **Kūn** (坤, Earth) Furnace and the **Yīn** (阴, Yin) Furnace—\nThe **Yīn Yáng** (阴阳, Yin-Yang) Furnace, for within the **Yīn** (阴, Yin) lies concealed the **Yáng** (阳, Yang).\nThe **Yǎn Yuè** (偃月, Reclined Moon) Furnace, for the moon manifests in the **Yuè** (兑, Joy) direction.\nThe **Xiān Tiān Miào Dǐng** (先天妙鼎, Primordial Wondrous Cauldron), for **Yuè** (兑) is the young maiden.\n\n*The Awakening to Reality* (《悟真》) speaks of “the **Chuǎn Yào Chuān Yuán** (产药川源, Birthplace of the Elixir’s Stream),” all referring to the place of origin.\n\nWhat are the matters of practice?\nTo attain utmost emptiness, to steadfastly preserve stillness—\nThen I observe its return.\nWith mud, one clarifies;\nWith stillness, one slowly purifies.\nWith tranquility, one endures;\nWith waiting, one carefully nurtures.\nAll these are matters of practice.\n\nWhat is the substance of return?\n**Hún Hún** (混混) becomes **Chéng Chéng** (成成),\n**Yǎo Yǎo** (窈窈) meets **Míng Míng** (冥冥),\nWithin which there is **Xìn** (信, Faith),\nWithin which there is **Jīng** (精, Essence).\nThe **Pǔ** (朴, Uncarved Primordial) without name,\nThe **Jīn** (金, Metal) without form—\nAll these are the substances of return.\n\nThe **Golden Elixir** (还丹) begins with this **Jīn** (金, Metal),\nThus it is called “having a beginning.”\nYet this **Jīn** (金, Metal) is not originally the **Kūn** (坤, Earth) family’s possession,\nBut the **Huǒ Jīng** (火精, Fire Essence) of the **Jiān** (乾, Heaven) family.\n\nThe **Dān Fǎ** (丹法, Elixir Method) takes **shā** (砂, sand) as its foundation,\nPlaced in the **Kūn** (坤, Earth) Furnace to form **Kǎn** (坎, Abyss),\nHarmonized with the **Yù Pó** (玉池, Jade Pool)’s **shuǐ yín** (水银, mercury) to create **wù tǔ** (戊土, Fifth-Earth Soil),\nWhich is the **Yáng Dān** (阳丹, Yang Elixir).\n\nThe **Yáng Dān** (阳丹, Yang Elixir) is the **Wài Dān** (外丹, External Elixir),\nThe **External Elixir** is the **Dān Běn** (丹本, Elixir Root),\nThe **Jīn Huā** (金花, Golden Flower) is it,\nThe **Zhēn Zhǒng** (真种, True Seed) is it,\nThe **Huáng Yá** (黄芽, Yellow Sprout) is it,\nThe **Bái Xuě** (白雪, White Snow) is it.\nThe **External Elixir** serves as the mother of the **Nèi Dān** (内丹, Internal Elixir),\nThus the beginning is called the mother of the world.\n\nThe mother has a sacred name: **Yáng Qiān** (阳铅, Yang Lead).\nWith **Yang Lead** as mother,\nThere is **Yīn Gǒng** (阴汞, Yin Mercury) as child.\n**Yīn Gǒng** (阴汞) is the **Hòu Tiān** (后天, Postnatal) essence of the child,\n**Yáng Qiān** (阳铅) is the **Xiān Tiān** (先天, Primordial) essence of the mother.\nWhen the **Yang Lead** from the outer realm subjugates the **Yīn Gǒng** (阴汞, Yin Mercury) of the inner realm,\nThe mother and child unite—\nThus one knows its child.\n\nYet the arrival of this **Yang Lead** requires the subtle application of **Huǒ Gōng** (火功, Fire Work).\nFor **lead** (铅) is generated in the **Kǎn Gōng** (坎宫, Abyss Palace),\nHeavy and unrising.\nTo seize and control the **Zhēn Gǒng** (真汞, True Mercury) of the **Lí Gōng** (离宫, Separation Palace),\nOne must apply fierce **wǔ huǒ** (武火, Martial Fire) to boil,\nThen it ascends in leaps and bounds.\nAfter the **Yang Lead** and **True Mercury** meet,\nOne must then preserve the **Shì Chéng** (守城, Fortifying) and **Mù Yù** (沐浴, Bathing) stages,\nNever again applying **Martial Fire**.\n\nAt first, the mother clings to the child in coming,\nThen the child clings to the mother in dwelling—\nThus it is said, *“Having known its child, one must again guard its mother.”*\nWhen mother and child cling to each other,\nOne shall not perish throughout life—\nThen the Great Elixir is complete.\n\nThe Great Elixir is called **Nèi Yào** (内药, Internal Medicine),\nThe **Sèng Tāi** (圣胎, Sacred Embryo) is this,\nThe **Yīng’ér** (婴儿, Infant) is this,\nThe **Zhēn Rén** (真人, True Person) is this.\n\nThose who cultivate the **Internal Elixir** must possess **Tiānrán Zhēn Huǒ** (天然真火, True Heavenly Fire),\nEndlessly nurtured within the **Tǔ Fǔ** (土釜, Earthen Cauldron),\nYet also rely on the **Yīn Yáng Fú Huǒ** (阴阳符火, Yin-Yang Talismanic Fire) of the external furnace,\nDiligently refining and adjusting.\n\nBy drawing and replenishing,\nOne transforms form into **qi** (气),\nAnd **qi** into **shén** (神, Spirit).\nWhen form and spirit are both perfected,\nThey align with the **Dao** in truth.\nThus one must block its **Yuè** (兑, Joy),\nAnd close its gate,\nFor the entire life’s work lies here.\n\nNurturing both kinds—\nThe **Wén Huǒ** (文火, Gentle Fire) within and the **Fú Huǒ** (符火, Talismanic Fire) without—\nPreserving the full ten months,\nAbandoning contrivance to realize non-action,\nOne dare not tire from external affairs,\nLest they disrupt the inner stillness.\n\n*The Three Harmonies* (《参同》) states:\n*“Firmly block its interactions,\nEndeavor to complete its solidity.\nObserve and wait with utmost caution,\nCarefully adjust its cold and warmth.\nCirculate through the twelve nodes,\nWhen each node is exhausted, again draw near.”*\nThis is the method of nurturing.\n\nThe inner realm does not escape,\nThe outer realm does not intrude—\nBlocking **Yuè** (兑) and closing the gate\nIs the essential key.\n\nIf one does not block its **Yuè** (兑),\nAnd instead daily engages with external affairs,\nThe **Dao** Family often speaks of temporal matters—\nThis is to seek aid in external schemes,\nYet already one has injured the inner cultivation.\nWhen the mouth opens, **shénqì** (神气, Spirit-Qi) scatters;\nWhen the mind is unsettled, **Fire Work** weakens.\nThe Great **Dao** of longevity\nI fear may not be fulfilled—\nThus it is said: *“Aid its affairs, yet one shall never be saved throughout life.”*\n\nTo perceive the small is called clarity—\nThe **Jīn Guāng** (金光, Golden Light) of the elixir,\nIts form like **shǔ mǐ** (黍米, millet grains),\nThus it is called small.\nTo see this small is called clarity.\n\nTo guard the soft is called strength—\nThe **Wáng Shuǐ** (王水, King Water) of the body,\nIts **qi** originally balanced and gentle,\nThus it is called soft.\nTo guard this soft is called strength.\n\nThe **Guāng** (光, Light) is the **shén** (神, Spirit),\nThat is, the **Golden Light**.\nThe **Míng** (明, Clarity) is the **qì** (气, Qi),\nThat is, the **Jīn Jīng** (金精, Metal Essence).\nWhen the **Golden Light** envelops the **Metal Essence**,\nThen light and clarity are concealed within,\nAnd **shénqì** (神气, Spirit-Qi) rely upon each other.\n\nWhen the embryonic nurturing is complete,\nOne escapes the calamities of the body—\nThus it is said: *“Using its light, yet returning to its clarity, one shall not suffer bodily harm.”*\nThis is called the **Dao** of *Following the Constant* (袭常),\nThe cultivation of longevity and enduring vision.\n\n*Following the Constant* means guarding its true constancy.\n\n**Mountain Evaluation**: This chapter is explained verse by verse with clarity,\nEach word extracted with precision—\nThe **Dao** of the **Golden Elixir** is fully revealed here.\nI have often said that the **Tàishàng** (太上, Supreme) Classic,\nThough concise in meaning,\nEven true

harmful,\nNor as noble,\nNor as lowly.\nThus, it is the most noble under heaven.\n\nThe knowing are those who have attained through practice.\nThe unspeaking are difficult to articulate,\nFor their profound cultivation and self-realization\nYearn to speak yet the tongue cannot keep pace.\nIf one merely values speech,\nAnd claims, *“I have mastered the true scriptures of the Daoists,\nTheir transmission is complete,\nNo need for a teacher’s guidance—\nMy Way is ready to be walked.”*\nHow could they know that **True** is indeed **True**,\nYet the subtle intricacies, the refined analogies,\nThe deep mechanisms of its teachings—\nI fear they have not yet fully explored them?\n\nMoreover, **ascending to the True** and entering the **Dao**,\nIs none other than **returning to the elixir** (还丹).\nOnce the **elixir’s principles** (还丹理) are clear,\nOnly then can one attain the **Dao**.\nNow I ask you:\nWhat are the **乾坤坎兑**—the **Hexagrams of Heaven, Earth, Water, and Fire**?\nWhat are the **龙虎汞铅**—the **Dragon, Tiger, Mercury, and Lead**?\nWhat are the **宾主雌雄**—the **Guest, Host, Yin, and Yang**?\nHow does one **体认** (embody and recognize) **恍惚杳冥**—the **flickering and boundless**?\nHow does one **安排** (settle) **浮沉颠倒**—the **rising and sinking, inversions**?\n\nAnd yet, unless the **Mysterious Mother** (玄牝) is illuminated,\nOne cannot achieve **transformation**.\nUnless the **Yellow Mother** (黄婆) is invoked,\nHow can one attain **consummation**?\n\nFurthermore, the **words are hard to convey**,\nThe **grace and awe are hard to spread**,\nThe **first opportunity is hard to find**,\nThe **fire’s intensity is hard to know**.\nAnd yet, some say:\nThe ancients declared: *“The Great Elixir’s affair\nMust be pursued with the aid of those of great power.”*\nTo seek the **wondrous methods of those of great power**—\nAsk me: Where are such teachings recorded?\n\n**Even more so**, the **practice and discipline** (功夫行持)\nCannot be borrowed from books.\nTo **abandon desire for beauty**,\nTo **forsake wealth for gain**,\nTo **reject affection for virtue**,\nTo **cultivate conduct with caution**—\nThese are all **essential bodily practices and moral disciplines**,\nYet none can be fully grasped from books alone.\n\nOnly those with **true hearts who love the Dao**,\nWho move the heavens above,\nWhose **earthly attachments dissolve**,\nWhose **divine clarity silently aids**—\nOnly these can truly know its **Way**.\n\nTo **follow the map and seek the horse** (按图索骥),\nIs it enough to exhaust its subtleties?\nThus, the knowing do not speak,\nThe speaking do not know—\nBecause there are things **too profound to articulate**.\n\nSome say:\n*“Those who know are indeed hard to speak of,\nBut how does one hear of the luminous Way\nOf those who do not know?\nIs it not through those who can speak\nGuiding them to knowledge?”*\nThe **Elixir Scriptures** say:\n*“Obtaining a teacher’s oral transmission (口诀),\nOnly then can one attain the Way.”*\nIt seems that the knowing must speak,\nAnd the speaking must know.\nPlease explain further.\n\nThe **oral transmission** (口诀) are **intimate words**,\n**Subtle utterances**—\nLayer upon layer, **pierced and revealed**,\nOnly then does it become **oral transmission**.\nIt is not merely a few phrases or sentences\nThat suffice as **oral transmission**.\n\nThe **Yellow Emperor sought Broad Success** (广成),\nAnd they spoke **refined matters for three days**.\nMy **teacher met Master Zhong** (钟祖),\nAnd they **sat in discourse for a decade**.\nEven the **heavenly saints** (天亶圣人),\nThe **highest roots of the Daoists** (上根仙器),\nCould not be fully understood in a few words—\nHow much less so for those below them?\n\nNowadays, people regard **oral transmission** as a **quickened secret**,\nBut this is all incorrect.\nUnless **oral transmission** is fully exhausted,\nThe teacher departs and returns.\nDuring their **instructive inquiries**,\nOne must **listen attentively, absorb deeply, and remember truly**.\nThen, it can **connect with the ancient texts**,\nAnd **illuminate the layered principles**.\nThis is the **wondrous essence of oral transmission**—\nWhen people read the **Elixir Scriptures**, if they have many,\nYet upon hearing the **oral transmission**,\nThey **suddenly awaken**—\nUsing the **Scriptures to verify the transmission**,\nUsing the **transmission to verify the Scriptures**,\nTrue and not hollow,\nIn accord with the **Great Dao**.\nThis is why **true teachers must be sought**,\nAnd why **bright minds cannot rely on mere cleverness alone**.\n\nMoreover, **true teachers** are **rooted in the original**,\nTheir **foundation is the soil of yin virtue** (阴德之土),\nRefined and cultivated—\nHow could they not know the **heavy mysteries of the Dao**?\nHeaven grants these **secret words** to the **good**,\nYet not to the **unworthy**.\nIf one knows yet **speaks lightly of them**,\nThen **Zhu Yang** (紫阳) would have **three times banished** them.\nTheir **silence is not mere reluctance to speak lightly**—\nEven if **great vessels meet**,\nAnd the **urgency of passing the torch** is keen,\nThey must **test repeatedly and temper thoroughly**.\nOnly then, after the **disciple’s diligent suffering**,\nDoes the **teacher reveal the fragrance, spread the teachings, and pass the bowl**.\nThis is the **future lineage’s unfolding**—\nBeware of hearing yet **not practicing**,\nOr obtaining yet **keeping secret**.\nWhen spoken of thus,\nIs it not **difficult**?\n\nMy **commentary on the *Laozi’s Dao

law** will be all the easier.\n\n**Discussing the first two lines of this chapter**,\n*Sealing the mouth* (塞兑) and *shutting the door* (闭门)\nIs **nurturing the spirit and *qi*** (养神气).\n*Dulling the

      "translated_text": "The opening three lines echo what was previously stated: *\"The utmost gentleness under Heaven, galloping through the utmost firmness under Heaven.\"* Without anything to replace it, meaning no other substance can surpass this in overcoming firmness. Though all under Heaven know the principle that *gentleness overcomes strength and softness overcomes hardness*, none can put it into practice.\n\nTherefore, the **Tàishàng** further cites the words of the sages to illustrate the profound virtue of gentleness: *\"To bear the filth of the state is called the guardian of the ancestral altars. To bear the misfortunes of the state is called the ruler of all under Heaven.\"* His words are upright yet seem contrary, for the sages take upon themselves the blame, saying: *\"I truly bear much guilt—what crime has the people committed? My virtue is thin and shallow; Heaven has sent this calamity upon me.\"* Their upright words appear reversed because they seek blame within themselves rather than pointing it outward at others. This is indeed the Dao of gentleness.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Ninth** (*River Master’s commentary originally titled \"Tasking Trust\" [任契], Peng’s text the same*)\n*\"When great grudges are reconciled, there will still be lingering grudges.\nHow can this be considered good?\nThus, the sages hold the left contract but do not blame the people.\nThose with virtue manage the contract, those without manage the fulfillment.\nThe Dao of Heaven has no favorites, always favoring those who are good.\"*\n\nIf the realm has many grudges, the ruler’s virtue must be shallow. If one meets the people’s grudges yet still does not blame oneself, but instead wishes to reconcile the great grudges, then even if some grudges are reconciled, there will still be those that remain unreconciled, and lingering grudges cannot be easily dispelled. How can this be called complete goodness?\n\nConfucius said: *\"If one is generous to oneself yet sparing in blaming others, one will be far from grudges.\"* Therefore, the sages govern the world by cultivating the virtue of self-generosity, gaining the people’s trust, and not blaming them—so the people naturally come to trust them. It is like sealing a covenant, dividing the contract into halves, each party holding their own, forever relying upon it. Then neither deceives the other, nor does one suspect the other.\n\nIf the sages uphold virtue as if holding the left contract, who among the people would not be delighted? Thus, those with virtue manage the contract, and those without manage the fulfillment.\n\nFulfillment (*彻*): means to examine faults. Those who obsessively examine faults, never reflecting upon themselves, will not be followed by the people. The Dao of Heaven has no favorites, always favoring those who are good. As the *Book of Documents* says: *\"The august Heaven has no favorites; reverence earns its favor. The people have no constant hearts; hearts turn toward those with kindness.\"*\n\n**Chapter Eightieth** (*River Master’s commentary originally titled \"Standing Alone\" [独立], Peng’s text titled \"Small States\"*)\n*\"Small states, few people.\nLet them possess the implements of ten or a hundred households yet not use them.\nLet them value death so much that they do not move far.\nThough they have boats and carriages, there is no need to ride them.\nThough they have armor and weapons, there is no need to display them.\nLet them return to knotting cords for record-keeping.\nLet them find their food sweet, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, their customs joyful.\nNeighboring states are in sight, the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard,\nYet the people live to old age and die without visiting one another.\"*\n\nThere are those who wish to make their states great and their populations numerous, possessing the implements of ten billion or a hundred million households yet not using them—then their use will only grow more extravagant. The **Tàishàng** does not follow this path. Instead, he uses the small to illustrate the great, showing that the small can encompass the great.\n\nIn a small state with few people, if they possess the implements of ten or a hundred households yet do not use them, their use will only become more abundant. What difficulty is there in returning to simplicity and purity? Therefore, he lets the people not use their implements, cherishing only their lives. They dwell in their native land, do not migrate to other regions. They value death yet do not die, nurturing life to prolong it—what else is there to seek?\n\nAt this time, the people within the state move with ease and vigor, so there is no need for boats or carriages. Within the state’s borders, thieves and bandits are nonexistent, so there is no need for armor or weapons. The governance of the state is pure and substantial, so the custom of knotting cords can be revived. The food is sweet, the clothing fine, the dwellings secure, and the customs joyful. Neighboring states are in sight, the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard, yet the people live to old age and die without visiting one another—then their interactions are simple and unburdened by extravagance, their provisions abundant yet each remains content in their own home.\n\nThe high-minded of the state say:\n*\"A single hill and valley suffice—we deem it better than the world beyond.\nA single spring and autumn pass in ease, as if forgotten within a pot.*\nGrandfathers and grandmothers live in lasting health,\nHusbands and wives grow old together in harmony.\nBrothers and sisters play on the *xūn* and *zhé*,\nChildren and grandchildren harmonize the *luán* and *hè*.\nWhat difference is there from the blessed lands of the immortals, the realm of Ultimate Bliss?\"*\n\n**Chapter Eighty-First**\n*\"Trustworthy words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not trustworthy.\nThe good do not argue; those who argue are not good.\nThe wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\nThe sages do not accumulate.\nWhen they act for others, their own virtue grows greater;\nWhen they give to others, their own abundance increases.\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming.\nThe Dao of the sages acts without striving.\"*\n\nTrust, goodness, and wisdom—all pertain to upright speech, summarizing the entire *Sutra*’s meaning. Sincere and substantial discourse is true alone, not adorned with empty flourishes to please the world. Those who seek to please the world rely on empty flourishes, not sincerity—hence it is said: *\"Trustworthy words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not trustworthy.\"*\n\nContinuing the fine tradition, it is uprightness alone, not engaging in sophistry to confuse others. Those who confuse others rely on sophistry, not on upholding tradition—hence it is said: *\"The good do not argue; those who argue are not good.\"*\n\nDiscourse that penetrates to its depths is one principle alone, not indulging in superficiality to display talent. Those who display talent indulge in superficiality, not depth—hence it is said: *\"The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\"*\n\nAnd yet, it follows with establishing virtue and deeds, fulfilling the grand purpose of this *Sutra*. Accumulation means accumulating goodness. The sages do not speak of accumulating goodness; they only establish their own great virtue and great deeds. Their virtue and deeds are boundless and universal, so when they act for others, their own virtue and deeds only grow greater.",

The sages’ Dao rests in effortless transformation, their hearts devoid of striving; they do not vie with others in amassing good deeds or reputation, so their greatness aligns with Heaven’s. The ancients said: *\"The highest excellence lies in establishing virtue, the next in establishing deeds, the next in establishing words. All three are imperishable.\"* This may be applied to what is spoken here.\n\nAfter completing his annotation of this *Sutra*, the Master of Emptiness’ conduct and speech harmonized with its teachings, as if he had studied it repeatedly. He claimed that without uttering a single word, he could reveal the true essence of the Way.\n\nThe concluding chapter, which speaks of virtue and merit as its final annotation, he also deemed most beautiful and good.\n\nThen, he pondered how the phrase *\"Act without contention\"* could serve as the root for all eighty-one chapters. Suddenly, he realized: *\"Yes, yes! This single sentence alone suffices as the sovereign grain of the entire *Sutra*.\"*\n\nWhat practitioners fear is hearing the Dao yet still engaging in petty strife for minor merit, minor virtue, trifling literary fame, or chasing after fleeting wealth and honors—thus exhausting their precious, useful lives in vain pursuits.\n\nThe sages’ Dao mirrors the Way of Heaven; Heaven’s Dao governs spontaneous transformation, naturally bringing benefit while inflicting no harm. The sages’ Dao encompasses effortless transformation—is it not also benefit without harm?\n\nI wish those who achieve their aims and fulfill their names, who exhaust filial piety and perfect loyalty, would all take refuge in the True and all attain the Dao. First, they refine themselves with jade-like purity, dwelling in great seclusion among the marketplace. Next, they forge their merit with gold-like precision, dwelling deeply in ravines and valleys.

Those whom you may grant office and emolument, you may also execute with axes and cleavers.’ I cannot be made a tool of others.”* She cast aside her basket and departed. Lao Lezi, delighted, immediately fled with his wife.\n\nSima Qian records: *“Laozi’s son was named Zong, who served as a general in Wei and was ennobled at Duan. Zong’s son was Wang. Wang’s son was Yan. Yan’s great-great-grandson was Xia, who served in the Han. Xia’s son Jie became tutor to the King of Jiaoxi, residing in Qi.”* At the time, the generations of ancestors and descendants must have wandered without fixed abode, their lineages branching and diverging. Some say: In Yue, he was Fan Li; in Qi, he was Yuyi; in Wu, he was Tao Zhu Gong; in the early Han, he was Huangshi Gong; during Emperor Wen’s reign, he was He Shang Gong—these are all matters beyond verification.\n\nGe Zichuan remarked: *“Laozi emerged in every age, often changing his name. The reason for this is that, according to the *Nine Palaces*, the *Three-Five Canon*, and the *Elemental Period Canon*, each person encounters critical junctures in life. When such times arrive, one must change one’s name to align with the shifts in primordial *qi*, thereby transcending calamity and prolonging life. Even in the present age, many Daoists do the same. Laozi remained in Zhou for over a hundred years, passing through multiple such junctures, hence his many names. To establish Laozi’s true origins, we must rely primarily on historical records and his own secret scriptures, cross-referencing them. Other folk accounts are largely baseless.”*\n\nMoreover, the *Western Ascension: Middle Embryo*, *The Return of the Mandate: The Wrapped*, *Pearl Stratagem and Jade Mechanism*, and the *Golden Canon: Inner Classic* all describe Laozi as having white-yellow skin, beautiful brows and broad forehead, long ears and large eyes, sparse teeth and square mouth, thick lips, and a forehead marked with three to five enlightened lines. His horns resembled the sun’s rays, his eyebrows hung like the moon, his nose was straight with twin pillars, his ears had three apertures, his feet stepped upon the numbers two and five, and his hands grasped ten symbols. He stood nine *chi* tall, with teeth numbering sixty-four—these were the outward signs of a sage.\n\nThose who receive the Mandate of Heaven inherently possess divine insight and foresight, differing from common mortals. They are the masters of the Dao, thus able to be aided by celestial beings and followed by immortals. Hence, the teachings he transmitted to save the world amounted to nine hundred thirty volumes, along with seventy volumes of talismans—all recorded in the central chapters of his original scriptures. The catalogues remain, and their authenticity can be verified. Those texts not included in this count were later additions by Daoist practitioners, not genuine works (as noted by Zichuan).\n\nLaozi cultivated effortlessly, refining himself through stillness (as recorded in the *Shiji*). He devoted himself entirely to longevity, yet though he remained in Zhou for centuries, his rank and status never advanced. He sought to blend his light with the mundane, his essence remaining naturally true. Only when his Dao was complete did he depart—he was indeed an immortal (*Shenxian Zhuan*).\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Zhou, he intended to inquire about ritual from Laozi. Laozi said, *“What you speak of—both the person and their bones—have long since decayed, yet their words endure. Moreover, a noble seeks to ride the times; if the times do not favor them, they travel lightly like a tumbleweed. I have heard: ‘A wise merchant conceals their wealth as if empty; a virtuous person’s excellence appears as folly.’ Abandon your arrogance and greed, your vain demeanor and licentious desires—for these bring no benefit to your life.”*\n\nLater, he asked Confucius, *“Have you attained the Dao?”*",

      "translated_text": "Confucius said, *“I have sought it for twenty-seven years and have not yet attained it.”*\n\nLaozi replied, *“If the Dao could be presented to others, then all would offer it to their lords. If the Dao could be advanced upon others, then all would advance it to their kin. If the Dao could be told to others, then all would tell it to their brothers. If the Dao could be transmitted to others, then all would transmit it to their children. Yet it cannot be so—there is no inner master to dwell within the Dao.”*\n\nWhen Confucius spoke to Laozi of *ren* and *yi*, Laozi said, *“Scatter chaff in the eyes, and the four directions shift. A gnat’s sting on the skin, and one cannot sleep the whole night. Now *ren* and *yi* are harsh and violent—they agitate my heart and mind, and no chaos is greater. My wish is that the world not lose its natural simplicity, that it move with the wind and stand firm in virtue, returning naturally to its origin. Why must you strive so ostentatiously, as if carrying a great drum to seek a lost child? The wild goose does not bathe daily to become white; the crow does not blacken itself daily to become black. Black and white in their simplicity are insufficient to distinguish beauty and ugliness. Unpraised observation is insufficient to expand one’s true nature. Fish left in a dried-up spring cling together on land, moistening each other with breath, nourishing each other with spittle—yet it is not as good as forgetting each other in the vast rivers and lakes.”*\n\nConfucius then said to Laozi, *“I have studied the *Odes*, the *Book of Documents*, the *Rites*, the *Music*, the *Symbols of the Yi*, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, and with these I have served seventy-two lords.”*",

      "original_text": "论先王之道，而明周召之迹，一君无所钩用，甚矣！ 人之难说也，道之难明邪。 ”老子曰：“六经，先王之陈迹也，岂其所以迹哉？ 今子之所言，皆犹迹也。 夫迹，履之所出，而迹岂履哉？ ” 孔子归，三日不谈。 子贡怪而问之，孔子曰：“鸟，吾知其能飞。 鱼，吾知其能游。 兽，吾知其能走。 走者可以网，游者可以纶，飞者可以矰。 至于龙，吾不知其乘风云而上九天矣。 今见老子，其犹龙乎？ ”（集史迁、《庄子》） 老子居周，久之，见周德衰，乃乘青牛车，西出秦关，以升昆仑。 关令尹喜望紫气，先知焉，乃扫道四十里以迎之。 已而老子果至，尹喜曰：“翁将隐矣，强为我着书。 ”乃停车关中，作《道德》五千余言，尽授尹喜而去。 东汉间，青州有王氏子者，名成，字玄甫，道号东华，遇昆仑西母王启珠。 珠喜其同姓，赐号白云上真，授以老子之青符玉篆，金科灵文。 玄甫服习三年，勤心弗懈。 老子感而降之，即以《黄庭·内景》删为一卷，名曰《外景》，以授玄甫修持，兼示九转八琼丹火候。 玄甫乃韬光晦迹，结庵静炼。 功成，号东华帝君，理东方少阳之气。 复称紫府少阳，为扶桑大帝，君辅相。 三传至纯阳先生，先生云：老子之《外景》及玉宸之《内景》皆藏于扶桑宫中，东华祖赞而传之，所以着老子度世之心也。 夫老子，前身本太上老君所托，故隐显变化，与老君如一辙。 老君在上古，首化三清。 天皇时变名万法天师，地皇时变名玄中法师，人皇时变名坚固先生，三皇后变名金阙帝君，伏羲时为郁华子（又改郁密），神农时为九灵老子，帝喾时为禄图子，尧时为务成子，舜时为尹寿子，夏禹时为真行子，商汤时为锡则子。 至商武丁时，始降全神为老子。 此又别开生面，再造乾坤之时也。 后人不知，混以老君为老子，遂以前身之事攒入后身。 或云老子是先天地生，或云老子是天之精魄。 使核实者叹为虚渺，不出《老仙正经》。 《抱朴子》云：夫有天德，则有道术。 道术之士，何时暂之？ 是以羲轩以来，至于三代，显名道术者，世世有之，何必常是一老子也？ 皆由晚学之徒，好奇尚异，欲推崇老子，故有此说。 其实论之，老子盖得道之尤精者，非神异也。 何者？ 若谓老子是得道，则人必勉力追慕。 若谓是神异，则长生不可学也。 以愚论之，老君在前为神异，老子在后与人同。 为神异者不可学，与人同者则可学也。 稚川之心，只从实据而已。 儒者谓圣人之生，因人气而禀天精，其言最允。 老子生身，借四大以成形，精修盛业，为神仙模范，道德宗风。 功完行满，归总诸天。 分而为万，合而为一。 分神降世，俱以修道为本，其不可学者在此，其有可学者亦在此也。 至若庄生、方朔辈，谓为老子易名者，皆不可信，此盖老子所赐者也。 宝颂云：“产漆园、方朔之辈，丹析微芒。 是乃如丹阳之母，梦受神人丹篆，而产大仙才也。 ”仙传曰：“世遵老子之教者，皆清虚恬静，与世无争，故能被褐怀玉，无有颠沛于险世。 ”其源远流长，汪洋若此，岂非乾坤所定万世之师表哉？ 月居青岛数载，尝以老子清净法指示晚成朱子、结成李子、回风刘子，盖兢兢恐惧，不敢忘家法云。 前有老君，后有老子，是一是二，融洽分明。",
      "translated_text": "「Discussing the *Dao* of the ancient kings, yet clarifying the traces of the Zhou and Chou rulers, one sovereign finds no practical use for it—how profound! How difficult it is to speak of humans, and how difficult it is to elucidate the *Dao*!」\n\nLaozi replied, *“The Six Classics are but the relics of the ancient kings—how could they be the means by which the *Dao* was practiced? What you speak of now are all mere traces. For traces are what the foot leaves behind, yet traces are not the feet themselves.”*\n\nConfucius returned, and for three days did not speak. Zigong wondered and asked him, *“Master, why is this so?”* Confucius said, *“I know that birds can fly, fish can swim, and beasts can run. Those that run can be caught in nets, those that swim can be reeled with lines, and those that fly can be snared with arrows. But as for the dragon, I do not know how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend to the ninth heaven. Now, seeing Laozi—is he not like the dragon?”*\n\nLaozi dwelled in Zhou for a long time, but seeing the decline of Zhou’s *virtue/power*, he ascended a green ox-cart and departed westward through the Qin Pass, ascending to Kunlun. The Pass Overseer Yin Xi observed a purple vapor and, foreknowing his arrival, swept the road for forty *li* to welcome him. When Laozi indeed arrived, Yin Xi said, *“Master, you are about to depart in seclusion—please, for me, write down your teachings.”* So he halted his cart in the pass and composed *The Dao and Virtue* in over five thousand words, imparting all to Yin Xi before departing.\n\nDuring the Eastern Han era, there was a descendant of the Wang family in Qingzhou, named Cheng, with the courtesy name Xuanfu, and the *Dao* name Donghua. He encountered the Kunlun Western Mother, Wang Qitian Zhu. Zhu, delighted by their shared surname, bestowed upon him the title Baiyun Shangzhen and gave him Laozi’s green talisman of jade seals and the golden sacred scriptures. Xuanfu devoted himself to these teachings for three years, diligently practicing without ceasing. Moved by his sincerity, Laozi descended and condensed *The Inner Landscape of the Yellow Court* into one volume, naming it *The Outer Landscape*, which he entrusted to Xuanfu for cultivation, also revealing the fire preparation methods for the nine-refinement, eight-essence elixir. Xuanfu then concealed his light and obscured his traces, building a hermitage to quietly refine his practice. When his efforts were complete, he was titled *Donghua Emperor*, overseeing the *qi* of the Eastern Minor Yang.\n\nHe was also called *Zifu Minor Yang*, the Great Emperor of Fushang, and the Lord of the Ministerial Assistants. Through three successive transmissions, he reached Chunyang Master, who declared: *“Laozi’s* Outer Landscape *and Yuzhen’s* Inner Landscape *are both stored in the Fushang Palace. Donghua’s ancestor praised and passed them down, recording Laozi’s intention to guide the world. The* Dao *of the Old Lord before and Laozi after—are they one or two? They are harmonious yet distinct.”*\n\nIn ancient times, Laozi’s previous incarnation was the embodiment of the *Dao* of the Supreme Old Lord (Laojun). Thus, his transformations between concealment and revelation mirrored those of the Old Lord. The Old Lord in the Upper Antiquity manifested as the Three Pure Ones. During the reign of Tianhuang, he was named the Heavenly Teacher of Ten Thousand Laws; during Dihuang, the Mysterious Middle Teacher of the Law; during Renhuang, the Firm Master. After the Three Sovereigns, he became the Golden Threshold Emperor. In the time of Fu Xi, he was called Yuxiazi (later changed to Yumi). In the time of Shennong, he was the Nine-Spirited Laozi. During the reign of Emperor Ku, he was Lutuzzi. In the time of Yao, he was Wuchengzi. In the time of Shun, he was Yinshouzi. In the time of Xia Yu, he was Zhenxingzi. In the time of Shang Tang, he was Xizezi. It was only during the reign of Shang’s Wuding that he descended fully as Laozi. This was another epoch of cosmic transformation, a new beginning for heaven and earth.\n\nLater scholars, unaware of this, conflated Laozi with Laojun, thus attributing the previous incarnation’s deeds to his later life. Some claimed Laozi was born before heaven and earth, while others asserted he was the essence of heaven. Such assertions leave even the most meticulous scholars in disbelief, beyond the *Laojun’s Authentic Scripture*. *The Master Who Embrace Simplicity* states: *“If one possesses the* Dao *of heaven, then one has the arts of the* Dao*. The practitioners of the* Dao *have existed since the time of Xī and Huāng, through to the Three Dynasties. Why must it always be one Laozi?”* This arises from later disciples who favor the strange and unusual, seeking to elevate Laozi’s status. In truth, Laozi was simply an extraordinary master of the *Dao*, not a supernatural figure.\n\nIf one claims Laozi attained the *Dao*, then people must strive to emulate him. If one claims he was a supernatural being, then longevity becomes unattainable through learning. In my humble view, Laojun before was supernatural, while Laozi later shared the same path as others. The supernatural cannot be learned, but the path shared by all can be. The core intent of Laozi’s teachings is simply this: to rely on truth.\n\nThe Confucian scholars say that the birth of sages is due to human *qi* receiving heavenly essence—this is the most plausible explanation. Laozi’s birth borrowed the Four Great Elements to form his shape; through rigorous cultivation, he achieved grand deeds, becoming the model for immortals and the exemplar of *Dao* and *virtue*. When his merits were fulfilled and his practice complete, he returned to oversee all the heavens. Divided into myriad forms, yet unified as one. He descended as a mortal, but both his divine and human aspects centered on cultivating the *Dao*—what cannot be learned lies here, and what can be learned also lies here.\n\nAs for Zhuangzi and Fang Shuo, their claims that Laozi merely changed his name are untrustworthy; these were indeed Laozi’s own bestowals. The *Treasure of Praise* states:\n*“Descendants like those of the Lacquer Garden and Fang Shuo—\nthey meticulously dissect the faintest radiance.\nIt is as if the mother of Dan Yang\ndreamed of receiving divine seals from an immortal,\nthus giving birth to the great sage’s talent.”*\n\nThe *Dao* transmissions say:\n*“Those who follow Laozi’s teachings\nare pure and tranquil, without contention with the world,\nthus they can embrace simplicity while harboring preciousness,\nnever facing adversity in a perilous age.”*\n\nHis origins are profound, his influence vast—\nhow could he not be the eternal exemplar set by heaven and earth?\n\nResiding on Qing Island for several years,\nhe often instructed the late disciples Zhuzi, Jiezi, and Huifeng Sizi\nwith his method of purity and stillness,\never vigilant and fearful,\nnever daring to forget his ancestral teachings.\n\nBefore there was Laojun,\nand after there was Laozi—\none in essence, two in form,\nharmonious yet clearly distinct.»",
