  "full_translation": "From the *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*, *Baopuzi Inner Chapters*, Scroll Two, by Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty, \"Resolving Difficulties,\" Chapter Seven\n\nSomeone asked: The august heavens are supremely divine, bestowing fate with perfect impartiality—why then do pine and cypress, mere commoners, receive the gift of deathless longevity, while the great sages Zhou and Kong enjoy no enduring span of life?\n\nBaopuzi replied: The length or brevity of life is truly determined by the celestial configurations one encounters at the moment of conception, when qi coalesces and the embryo forms. The Dao of Heaven acts without deliberate action, allowing things to follow their natural course—it shows no partiality, no favor, no distinction between this and that. If one’s fate is bound to the star of life, that person will inevitably be drawn to the Dao of immortality; those drawn to the Dao of immortality will, if they seek it, surely attain it. If one’s fate is bound to the star of death, that person will not believe in the Dao of immortality and will not cultivate its practices. Whether one delights in goodness or not is decided by what one is endowed with; alteration, bestowal, or deprivation are not within Heaven’s power. It is like gold and iron being smelted in the furnace or pottery and tiles being shaped in the kiln: though the furnace and kiln bring them into form, the sharpness or dullness of tools, the uprightness or crookedness of jars, depend on what they encounter—this is no longer the work of the furnace or kiln.\n\nThe questioner objected: All that a skilled craftsman creates comes from his own hands. How can the divine intelligence of Heaven be incapable of anything? Yet you claim that human lives each encounter their own configurations, and are not shaped by the vast azure. This I find deeply perplexing—I cannot assent to it.\n\nBaopuzi answered: When the primordial chaos split and the clear and turbid separated, some rose and moved, others descended and stilled—even Heaven and Earth do not know why this is so. The myriad things respond to qi, each following its own nature, and together with Heaven and Earth, each becomes a distinct entity. The only difference lies in their sequence of formation and the scale of their bodies. Because Heaven and Earth are vast, we perceive the myriad things as small; because the myriad things are small, we perceive Heaven and Earth as vast. Moreover, though the abdomen and back enclose the five viscera, they do not create them; though skin and flesh envelop blood and qi, they do not produce them. Though Heaven and Earth contain the myriad things, they do not bring them into being. It is like grasses and trees relying on mountains and forests to sprout and flourish, yet the mountains and forests do not act upon them; fish and turtles depending on lakes and marshes to propagate, yet the lakes and marshes do not intervene. The common folk, seeing the vastness of Heaven and Earth and the smallness of the myriad things, say that Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things, and the myriad things are their descendants. Yet the lice born upon me—did I create them? Thus, though lice cannot arise without me, I am not their parent, nor are they my descendants. Gnats breed in vinegar, lingzhi and glutinous rice grow on trees and rocks, beetles thrive in filth and sludge, and emerald vines flourish on pine branches—none of these four are crafted by those things. The myriad things teem within Heaven and Earth—how is this different?\n\nBehold! Heaven possesses the sun and moon, the cycles of cold and heat; man possesses sight and hearing, breath and movement. By drawing distant analogies and extending near observations, one infers from this to that. Man cannot comprehend his own body—why he ages or grows young, why he feels pain or itches—just as Heaven cannot comprehend its own body, the reasons for its waxing and waning, its calamities and auspices. Man cannot ensure his ears and eyes remain ever sharp, his nourishing and defending *qi* unceasing; thus, Heaven cannot ensure the sun and moon avoid eclipses or the four seasons maintain their order. From this reasoning, matters of premature death or longevity truly do not lie with Heaven and Earth, nor are the secrets of immortality their doing.\n\nThat which gives me life is my father; that which bears me is my mother. Yet even they cannot guarantee my form will be perfectly proportioned, my countenance fair and lovely, my nature and principles balanced and harmonious, my wisdom lofty and far-reaching. They cannot multiply my strength, prolong my years, or extend my lifespan. Instead, some are stunted and frail, some dark and ugly; some are deaf, blind, stubborn, or perverse; some are crippled, toiling, or lame. What they obtain is not what they desire; what they desire is not what they obtain. How much less can Heaven and Earth, so vast and distant, achieve this? Even parents are far removed—how can I, possessing this body, ensure it remains forever robust and unaging, perpetually healthy and free from illness, its joy and anger never misplaced, its plans and reflections without regret or remorse? Thus, those who bestow *qi* and shape form are my parents; those who receive and possess them are my own body. Beyond these, nothing is more intimately connected, nothing exerts greater control. If even these two cannot alter or benefit me, how can Heaven and Earth claim any part in it?\n\nIf all beings were truly the creations of Heaven and Earth, they should all be good without evil, complete without flaw, and all living things should fulfill their destinies without the sorrow of spring’s fading or autumn’s decay. Yet Heaven cannot grant Confucius or Mencius the blessing of transcending the world, proving that what they received was natural, not apportioned by Heaven and Earth. Sagehood is the pinnacle of virtue; if Heaven could bestow such perfect virtue, why would it not allow their desires to be fully realized, their achievements established, their positions supreme, their lifespans exceeding a century? This is no proof of Heaven’s deliberate action. The death of a sage is not Heaven’s killing, just as the birth of a sage is not Heaven’s creation. The worthy are not necessarily long-lived, nor are the foolish doomed to die young; goodness does not always bring fortune, nor does evil always invite disaster. Birth has no fixed term, death no constant measure. Men of towering virtue and wisdom may wither unfulfilled, while the mediocre Dou Gong lived to two hundred; Bo Niu was stricken with illness, Zixia lost his sight; the villainous Robber Zhi lived to a white-haired old age, while the wicked Zhuang Qiao sported a head of yellow hair. In this, Heaven’s non-action is manifest.\n\nSome say, Confucius declared, \"Since ancient times, all must die,\" while Laozi spoke of the learnability of divine transcendence. The words of sages are trustworthy and verifiable, but the teachings of Daoists are fanciful and difficult to apply. The *Baopuzi* states: Confucius is the sage of the Confucians, Laozi the sage of the Dao. Confucian teachings are near and easy to perceive, hence many follow them; the intent of the Dao is distant and hard to grasp, hence few attain it. The Dao is the source of the ten thousand differences; Confucianism is but a stream of the great purity. Before the Three Sovereigns, the Dao governed; since the rise of emperors and kings, Confucianism has prevailed. Discussants all know to esteem the simplicity of high antiquity and disdain the decadence of later ages—why then do they revere Confucius while belittling Laozi? This is like admiring the blossoms at the tips of branches while failing to recognize the root from which they grow. How is this different from prizing luminous pearls while despising the deep pools, cherishing the *He* jade while loathing Mount Jing? They do not know that the deep pools are the source of luminous pearls, and Mount Jing the origin of the *He* jade.\n\nMoreover, nurturing one’s nature is but a remnant of the Dao; ordering the world is but a minor aspect of Confucianism.\n\nThus, the value of Confucianism lies in its power to transform customs and reform manners—not merely in its rites of bowing and yielding or its measured steps. The reverence for the Dao rests in its silent transformation, its influence extending far beyond the single matter of nurturing life.\n\nIf Confucianism and the Dao truly had an order of precedence, then Confucius could not be exclusively trusted, nor could Laozi be employed in isolation. Confucius himself paid respectful homage to Boyang, wishing to be compared to Lao Peng, and admitted that while he understood the ways of fish and birds, he did not comprehend the dragon—a metaphor by which he acknowledged Laozi as the dragon, an expression of heartfelt admiration, not empty words. This is no different from his words to Yan Hui: *\"Gazing at it, it appears ahead; suddenly, it is behind. Boring into it, it grows ever harder; looking up to it, it grows ever higher.\"*\n\nSome ask: *\"Confucius personally met Laozi yet did not follow his teachings—why?\"* The *Baopuzi* replies: *\"This makes it all the clearer that what one is endowed with is a mandate of nature, and what one esteems is an unchanging disposition. Confucius recognized the profound subtlety of Laozi’s teachings and valued their rarity, yet he could not draw from the wellspring of pure emptiness at its source. The Great Ancestor emerges beyond form and enters within the Perfect Dao. What he sought to learn was confined to matters of the common world—how could he have entreated the methods of immortality? His heart was wholly absorbed in teaching and transformation, with no thought for esoteric arts. Though sagely in worldly affairs, Confucius was not one to abide in stillness, profound silence, self-preservation, or non-action. Thus, Laozi admonished him: *'A good merchant hides his treasures as if empty; a noble man of great virtue appears foolish. Shed your pride, your excess of desires, your overbearing demeanor, your reckless ambitions—these bring no benefit to your person.'* From this, we may know that Confucius was not free from worldly attachments and was no practitioner of immortality’s Way.\n\nEver restless, ever anxious, his sole concern was to set the age aright—lamenting the phoenix’s silence above, sighing over the gourd’s unsold fate below. How could one so impassioned in his desire to wield the whip of governance abandon the work of ordering the world to pursue the roundabout path of nurturing life?\"\n\nSome ask: *\"Between the endeavors of Confucianism and the Dao, which is more difficult, which easier?\"* The *Baopuzi* answers: *\"Confucianism is difficulty within ease; the Dao is ease within difficulty. To renounce social ties, forsake wife and children, reject fame and honor, forgo profit and rank, turn from the dazzling before one’s eyes, and silence the clamor in one’s ears—to remain serene and withdrawn, content in solitude, guarding one’s integrity, unmoved by slander, unelated by praise, indifferent to high station, unashamed of lowly estate—this is the difficulty of the Dao. Yet one need not attend to condolences or visits, bear no burden of care for others, exhaust neither mind in the Seven Classics nor thought in calculations and calendrics, suffer no toil of astrological reckoning, nor servitude to literary arts. Freed from the weight of worldly burdens, harmony naturally flourishes; in non-action and non-concern, one knows no fear or dread—this is the ease of the Dao. Thus, it is ease within difficulty.\n\nThe Confucian, by contrast, follows established laws and models, his conduct governed by rules, his speech and silence timed to the moment, his teachers found in every household, his books clarified by commentaries and annotations—this is the ease of Confucianism. Yet to probe the profound and reach the distant, to weave together the ancient canons, to master the *He* and *Luo* texts, to encompass the vast learning of the Hundred Schools, to cultivate virtue in humble lanes, to devote one’s resolve to serving the ruler, to strain one’s spirit toward celestial patterns, to apply one’s thought to wind and clouds—if one matter remains unknown, one’s work is incomplete; if a single word is amiss, praise and blame are misapplied. Every step becomes a model for the world; every utterance is transmitted across the land—this is the difficulty of Confucianism. Thus, it is difficulty within ease.\n\nWeighing the two, the Confucian path is largely difficult, while the Daoist way is succinct and easy. I have already suffered its difficulties—why not abandon it and follow what is easy? Yet those who mock me in this world are as numerous as shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, while those who share my aspirations remain unseen. If like-minded souls exist, they must belong to a future age—for I do not consider them rare.\n\nSome say: *'Among the eminent scholars and erudite masters I have encountered—those who have plumbed principles to their depths, exhausted the nature of things, and scrutinized the boundaries of being and non-being—many have there been. Yet none have spoken of extending life or attaining immortality. Though your brilliance may rival the sun and moon, and your thoughts surpass ten thousand men, you suddenly discourse on the Way of long life—how can I believe it?'* The *Baopuzi* replies: *'Am I a man of mediocre talent, shallow insight, and scant learning, who would dare claim unique understanding surpassing all others? Yet have I not sought what is manifest and found it in the obscure? Have I not obtained with ease what others deem difficult?'* \"\n\nThose who dispute minor proofs will recognize their greater efficacy; those who witness what has already come to pass will understand what has yet to be tested.\n\nMoreover, those who disbelieve in the existence of immortals in this world generally possess only the talents of common scholars, the skills of officeholders, or the knowledge gleaned from books that aid instruction. They judge human affairs by what is near and easily discerned, and when confronted with the vulgar delusions of the multitude, they claim: *\"What others doubt, I alone can decide; what has not yet shown its first signs, I can foresee.\"* Thus, they believe they have exhausted the nature of all things, penetrated all that is hidden and obscure, and obtained all that can be known. If I say there are no immortals, then immortals must not exist—so firmly entrenched is this conviction.\n\nI have often observed mediocre scholars who stubbornly reject and disbelieve in such matters. Their failing lies in possessing some intelligence yet being crippled by partiality and constraint, shackled by their own limitations, unwilling to consider what lies beyond. They are utterly benighted, unable to distinguish beans from wheat. To use the narrow vision of a pipe to block what their own intelligence cannot grasp—how is this different from using a single-rope well bucket to draw water from a hundred-fathom depth, then blaming the well for having no water when they fail to recognize the inadequacy of their tool?\n\nThe common folk hear the roar of fierce winds and raging fires and call it winter thunder; they see drifting clouds moving west and claim the moon is racing east. Though others may tell them otherwise, they refuse to understand, placing such faith in their own judgments. Indeed, in matters of sound, none fail to trust their own ears—yet how often are they deceived?\n\nThose who observe form place unwavering trust in their own eyes—yet when what they hear and see is affirmed as true but proves false, are their ears and eyes truly beyond doubt? How much more so with the mind’s conjectures, which discern neither form nor sound, and whose obscurity far exceeds that of sight and hearing. To take what one’s own heart grasps as certain and then, on that basis, dismiss the most distant matters of the world—claiming that tales of divine transcendents are mere fabrications—is this not folly?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* says: Beauty and ugliness are fixed, yet love and hatred arise from differing sentiments, so the two eyes do not see for one another. The refined and the vulgar have long been distinct, yet likes and dislikes vary, so the two ears do not hear for one another. Truth and falsehood have their essence, yet inclinations and aversions clash, so the two hearts do not counsel one another. There are those who take the ugly for the beautiful, the turbid for the clear, the loss for the gain—these three divergences are glaringly evident, so plain to see. Yet even in such obvious cases, no unity of perception can be achieved. How much less, then, with the subtleties of divine transcendence, where expecting all to believe is without any plausible basis? If every person were made to understand, what value would there be in those of profound insight?\n\nTo wait for the common folk to cease their reckless talk is to wait for the Yellow River to run clear—it would not be long by comparison. My silence is not absolute; I hope only to guide those who may ascend or descend in understanding. As for the unyielding, even the ancients could do nothing with them.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* says: The difficulty of clarifying the highest truths and the skepticism toward divine transcendence are of long standing. [...] The rustic of Ma’s wilds, the ancient Duke, could not dissuade the Rong and Di from their desires—truth had its limits, and good words went unheeded. The *zhangfu* cap found no market among the Man and Yue; the red shoes were not worn by the Rong and Yi. How could one force them? To point at jade and call it stone is not because the jade is false, but because only a He Shi can recognize it.\n\nTo see a dragon and call it a snake is not because the dragon lacks numinosity, but because only Cai Mo can distinguish it. The reason the Dao is prized is that it cannot be increased by addition nor diminished by subtraction. The reason virtue is prized is that one hears slander without gloom and sees praise without delight. Those who firmly believe the world has no immortals, while I alone contend that they truly exist—this dispute grows ever more protracted, and their obstinacy ever more entrenched. Is this not a futile prolongation of this endless strife, offering no remedy for their incomprehension? Should one truly follow the principle of the interlocking rings?\n\n*Releasing Doubts*, Chapter Eight\n\nSomeone asked: The ways of humanity are manifold, and seeking immortality is supremely difficult. If one does not abandon worldly affairs, how can one simultaneously attend to literary arts, the concerns of sorrow and joy, and the Way of ruler and minister?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replied: The Dao is not burdensome; what is rare is the few who act upon it. The only concern is whether one’s resolve is firmly established and one’s faith unwavering—why fear the neglect of human affairs? Those of great talent can cultivate both without difficulty. They inwardly treasure the Way of nurturing life and outwardly harmonize with the world. In governing the self, they achieve long cultivation; in governing the state, they bring great peace. They use the Six Classics to instruct the common people and transmit esoteric arts to those of like mind. If they wish to remain briefly, they stay to assist the times; if they wish to ascend, they soar into the clouds and lightly depart—these are the superior scholars. Those who rely on their own abilities but cannot achieve both may set aside worldly affairs and focus solely on cultivating the Dao—these are the next best. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor bore the burden of the Four Seas yet did not hinder his ascent at Mount Dinghu. Peng Zu served as a grandee for eight hundred years before traveling west to the Flowing Sands. Boyang was a chronicler, Maofeng a potter, Fang Hui a scholar, Lü Wang a grand preceptor, Qiu Sheng served in Yin, Ma Tui was an official in Jin, Lord Fan conquered Yue and sailed the seas, Qin Gao held a tablet in Song, Kang Changsheng humbled himself to hold the whip, and Duke Zhuang concealed his talents as a minor scribe. Many ancients attained the Dao while aiding the world, cultivating it in court and market—surely they had surplus energy. Why must one retreat to the mountains and forests, completely abandoning the affairs of the people, before achieving success?\n\nThere are also those whose hearts find peace in stillness, whose natures abhor clamor, who delight in freedom and loathe honor and office. They wear coarse ropes and tattered clothes, eat wild herbs, hold the plow, and enjoy their three joys. They abide by constancy, await their end, do not scheme for a fleeting life, and do not fear swift death. They decline appointments worth a thousand gold and scorn the nobility of high ministers. Even without cultivation, they are already like this—how much less would they be willing to serve the world if they were to add the supreme Dao to their practice? Each follows their own aspirations; one cannot generalize.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* said: The world says that a single good word is worth a thousand gold—yet this refers only to the gains and losses of state or the right and wrong of personal conduct. As for teaching others the secret of long life or transmitting the method of immortality, this is not merely a good word like those of ordinary people. How could it be worth only a thousand gold? If someone on the verge of death from illness could be saved and restored to health, none would fail to call it a profound kindness and a great favor. Now, if one follows the immortal classics and ingests the Nine Elixirs of liquid gold and jade, the entire world could be made immortal—its beneficence would not be merely the merit of saving one person. The virtue of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi is truly immeasurable, yet none recognize it, dismissing it as absurd and preposterous—how lamentable!\n\nThe *Baopuzi* said: To seek immortality, one must grasp its essentials. The essentials lie in treasuring essence, practicing qi, and ingesting the great elixir—this is sufficient, and no more is needed. Yet these three matters again have shallow and deep levels. Without a named teacher or enduring hardship, one cannot master them hastily. Though it is said to practice qi, there are several methods of doing so. Though it is said to practice the bedchamber arts, there are nearly a hundred techniques therein. Though it is said to ingest elixirs, there are roughly a thousand formulas for doing so. When first teaching others, one begins with the shallow. Only when their resolve is unwavering and their diligence evident does one reveal the deeper methods.\n\nThus, practicing qi can cure a hundred illnesses, enter epidemics, subdue tigers and snakes, stanch wounds and bleeding, allow one to dwell in water or walk upon it, ward off hunger and thirst, or extend lifespan. Its great essential is embryonic breathing. Those who attain embryonic breathing can refrain from exhaling and inhaling through the nose and mouth, as if within the womb—then the Dao is achieved. When first learning to practice qi, one draws qi through the nose and holds it, silently counting to one hundred twenty before gently exhaling through the mouth. Both inhalation and exhalation should be inaudible to oneself. One should always inhale more and exhale less. A test is to place a goose feather on the nose and mouth—if the feather does not move when exhaling, this is the sign. Gradually increase the count over time, and eventually one can reach a thousand. At a thousand, the old become young again, and one day’s practice reverses a day’s aging.\n\nOne should practice qi during the time of living qi, not during the time of dead qi. Thus it is said: \"The immortal ingests the six qi.\" In a day and night, there are twelve hours. From midnight to noon are the six hours of living qi; from noon to midnight are the six hours of dead qi. Practicing qi during dead qi is of no benefit. Those who use qi can exhale upon water, causing it to flow backward for several paces; exhale upon fire, causing it to extinguish; exhale upon tigers and wolves, causing them to crouch and be unable to move; exhale upon snakes and vipers, causing them to coil and be unable to depart. If another is wounded by blades or weapons, exhaling upon them stanches the blood. If one hears of someone struck by poison, even if unseen, one can exhale from afar, directing the breath—men exhale upon their left hand, women upon their right—and though the person may be a hundred miles away, they will immediately recover. For sudden afflictions or acute illnesses, merely swallowing the qi of three nines also brings instant relief. Yet human nature is often restless, and few can remain tranquil to cultivate this Way.\n\nMoreover, in practicing qi, one should not eat too much raw vegetables or rich, fresh foods, as they make the qi strong and difficult to contain. One must also refrain from anger, for much anger disorders the qi, preventing its overflow and sometimes causing coughing—thus few can succeed in this practice. My great-grandfather, the Immortal Duke, whenever deeply drunk or in the height of summer’s heat, would enter the depths of deep pools and remain for a day before emerging—this was precisely because he could close his breath and practice embryonic breathing.\n\nThe bedchamber arts comprise over ten schools: some repair injuries and damages, some attack and cure various illnesses, some gather yin to replenish yang, and some increase years and extend life. Their great essential lies in the single matter of returning essence to replenish the brain.\n\nThis method is one passed down orally from one true adept to another, never committed to writing. Even if one consumes famous medicines yet remains ignorant of this essential teaching, one still cannot attain longevity. Moreover, one must not completely abstain from the union of yin and yang, for doing so leads to stagnation and obstruction, giving rise to pent-up resentment, loneliness, illness, and shortened life. Yet yielding to unbridled desire also diminishes one’s years and vitality. Only by attaining the harmony of regulated release can one avoid harm. Without the oral transmission of its techniques, not a single practitioner will fail to injure or even destroy themselves through this practice.\n\nThe likes of Xuansuzi, Rongchenggong, and Pengzu recorded only its coarse aspects, never committing its most essential teachings to paper. Those who aspire to immortality should diligently seek and practice it. I have recorded these words as I received them from my teacher, Master Zheng, to show future believers in the Dao—this is no groundless speculation. Yet I myself have not fully mastered its secrets.\n\nSome Daoist practitioners of one narrow path may wish to focus solely on the arts of sexual union in pursuit of immortality, neglecting the great medicine of golden elixir—this is utter folly. As the *Baopuzi* states, the Daoist texts that derive from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi are but a small fraction. Most are the work of later enthusiasts, each adding their own interpretations, so that the volumes now pile up like mountains. The ancients were simple and often lacked literary talent; their discussions of natural principles were incomplete, their evidence unclear. They concealed their essential teachings, making them difficult to understand, and even when explained, the explanations were not profound enough to fully expound their meaning, open the way for the frustrated, encourage the determined, instruct beginners, or reveal the subtle paths of the mysterious and wondrous, the sources of fortune and misfortune. Merely reciting these texts ten thousand times will yield nothing. Even if one seeks broad learning, one should carefully select the finest works and focus on them, for texts that do not convey the essential Way are not worth poring over.\n\nSome later learners fail to distinguish the depth of their authors. Taking anything labeled as Daoist teachings, they collect them indiscriminately until their boxes and baskets overflow, exhausting their minds in search of meaning—like seeking phoenix eggs in a swallow’s nest or trying to catch eels at the bottom of a well. No matter how diligent their efforts, they seek what cannot be found, gaining nothing of practical use. They waste their days and months in vain toil, reaping not even the slightest benefit. In public life, they fail in their duties; in private, they achieve no longevity. Thus, people inevitably point and say, “They practiced the Dao so diligently yet did not transcend the world—surely there is no method for avoiding death!” But they do not realize that such seekers of immortality are like those who stand by a river, admiring the fish but lacking a net—it is not that the water holds no fish.\n\nThe *Five Thousand Characters* may have come from Laozi, yet they are but general and cursory discussions. They never fully present a coherent method that can be verified. Merely reciting this scripture without grasping its essential Way is labor in vain—how much more so for those who fall short of even that?\n\nAs for Wenzi, Zhuangzi, Guanling Yinxin, and their like, though their florid writings trace back to the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, expounding the great principles of the mysterious and empty, they never reveal the ultimate teachings. Some even equate life and death, calling them no different, treating survival as forced labor and demise as rest—such views are already a thousand *li* removed from the path of immortality. How can they be worth indulging? Yet their allegories and parables may still offer some value for minor uses, filling gaps in times of need. Alas, that later generations of glib, unscrupulous, and immoral men have made Laozi and Zhuangzi their dens of refuge—is this not lamentable?\n\nSome may ask: “In an age ruled by a sagely and enlightened sovereign who treasures only the worthy, if those who study immortality refuse to enter office and instead cultivate the Dao, who will assist in governance?” The *Baopuzi* replies: To turn one’s back on a sagely ruler and dwell in the mountains was why Chaofu and Xu You were esteemed. To encounter a virtuous age and withdraw from the world was why Zhuang Bo was honored. The Yellow Emperor ruled all under heaven in perfect order, yet Guangchengzi did not serve him. Tang Yao governed the four seas in great peace, yet Woquan did not assist him. Yet neither the transformative power of their virtue nor the supply of talented men suffered for it.\n\nWhen Tang overthrew the Xia, Wu Guang bore a stone and cast himself into the river; when King Wu destroyed the Shang, Boyi and Shuqi refused to eat in the Western Mountains. When Duke Huan of Qi rose to power, Shao Ji reclined in a humble lane; when Wei Wen flourished, Gan Mu let his hair loose at his gate. The Four Elders withdrew to Shangluo, yet this did not hinder the great achievements of the Han; Zhou Dang stood aloof in the forests and marshes, yet this did no harm to the penal reforms of Emperor Wen. For such men, neither favor nor wealth could sway their hearts, nor could extreme riches alter their resolve. They washed their tassels in the Canglang’s waters, neither submitting nor suffering disgrace. They took fragrant groves as their pavilions, towering peaks as their mansions, emerald orchids as their cushions, green leaves as their curtains. They wore coarse cloth in place of court robes, ate wild greens instead of fine fare. Without tilling the soil themselves, they did not fill their bellies; without their wives’ weaving, they did not clothe their bodies. Such men have appeared from time to time over a thousand years—how much more so when they further abandon their kin to their clans, forsake their households without a glance, spurn glory as if it were dust, banish desire from their hearts, scale towering peaks alone, befriend echoes in the famed mountains, turn inward to the formless realm, and return to the utmost stillness? Within the eight directions, they guard against none, yet you fear the ruler will lack ministers—is this not excessive worry?\n\nSome may say: “Those who study immortality merely purify themselves while neglecting the great bonds of society; they turn their backs on the sovereign and display disloyal disrespect. I fear they will fail to achieve long life and instead incur punishment.” The *Baopuzi* replies: The northerners Shi Hu and Shan Juan, along with Zizhou, were all men of great talent, yet they lived in seclusion, roamed freely, and nurtured their vast integrity. Neither the grand transformations of the age nor the great Way suffered loss for it. How much less should those who study immortality necessarily possess the talent to govern or the usefulness to stand in court? Gaining them would not add even a drop of dew’s benefit; losing them would not cause the slightest harm. Today, the nine provinces are united, and even those from distant lands come to serve. The virtuous and capable are abundant, yet there are idle officials awaiting posts and long-serving ones sighing over delayed promotions. Those of high talent chafe under seniority constraints. The flourishing of worthy men is unmatched—how could the realm lack even a single commoner?\n\nIn former times, Prince Jin abandoned his duty to attend the royal meals and relinquished his position as heir apparent, yet King Ling did not reproach him for disloyalty. Yin Sheng resigned his official sash and departed from his post, yet the Zhou did not condemn him for disloyalty. Why? They truly understood that such men did not slight the world or despise the ruler; their aspirations simply differed from those of ordinary men and could not be altered. A ruler of the Dao harbors tolerance and forgiveness, knowing that human hearts cannot be the same and that each person’s path in life differs. He does not compel or forbid, thereby honoring and magnifying the highest principles. Above, he bears no grudging narrowness; below, he enjoys the utmost joy of those who follow their hearts. Thus, his radiant reputation shines in all directions, and even the greedy, hearing of it, feel shame.\n\nI have heard that when the balmy winds rise, fur robes and stoves are put away; when the world’s path is level, extraordinary men withdraw. Now that the ravages of war are settled, oxen are left to rest and horses released; beacon fires are extinguished, and the shadows of shields and spears are stilled. The mighty bows *Fanruo* and *Luque* are sheathed and cooked. Zhang Liang left the dark tent to return to the lanes; Xin Pi doffed his armor to take up fishing. How much more so for those who study immortality—of whom there is not even one in ten thousand—what harm could the state suffer in sparing them?\n\nYet their practice lies in few thoughts and scant desires; their work lies in preserving the body and prolonging life. They do not engage in the ugliness of competition nor bear the burden of offending custom—what crime is there in this? Moreover, the peaks of Hua and Heng are vast, the ocean’s expanse boundless. Their heights do not await the arrival of soaring dust; their depths do not rely on the inflow of rainwater. A handful of earth cannot diminish their loftiness; a ladle of water cannot lessen their breadth. In a generation, there are but a few immortals—how could they disrupt the world’s affairs?\n\nSome may say: “If the Dao of immortality can truly be sought and attained, why do the Five Classics not record it? Why do Zhou and Confucius not speak of it? Why do the sages not transcend the world? Why do the supremely wise not live forever? If Zhou and Confucius did not know of it, they cannot be called sages; if they knew but did not study it, then there is no Dao of immortality.” The *Baopuzi* replies: Human lives correspond to the stars, each with its destined station—this has already been explained in the preceding chapter. You might as well wear a basin on your head and look up, failing to see the radiance of the seven luminaries, or briefly crane your neck toward a great river, unaware of the wonders in its depths.\n\nThere are countless things the Five Classics do not record; there are many matters Zhou and Confucius did not speak of. Let me briefly mention a fraction for you. Though you may laugh uncontrollably and your feelings may be hard to open, let me at least allow you to hear a rough outline.\n\nHeaven and earth are the greatest of all things. The nine sages together composed the *Book of Changes*, which suffices to encompass yin and yang—nothing more can be added. Now, ask a master of the *Changes*: What are the degrees of the celestial sphere? How vast are the four seas? How far apart are the cosmos? Where does the upper limit end? Where does the lower limit rest? What propels their turning and movement? Why do the sun and moon vary in speed? What causes the nine paths’ excesses, the alternation of dawn and dusk, the lengthening and shortening of days? How do the seven stars take turns governing? How do the five planets wax and wane? What causes the halos, eclipses, conjunctions, and transgressions of the four and seven? Where do comets and broom stars emerge? What are the anomalies of celestial arrows and vapors? What are the omens of solar halos and old stars? Why does the pole star not move while the guardian star still drifts east? Why does the sun’s light extend beyond its form, while the moon’s light is cold within? Why does the Milky Way, when viewed from above, embody the nature of moisture flowing downward? Why do the tides ebb and flow with great and small variations? How do the five notes and six pitches convey emotions of joy and anger? How do clouds move and qi rise, bearing signs of fortune and misfortune? What are the *changqiang*, *you shi*, *xun*, and *shizhong*? What are the *sizhen* and *wucan*? What are the *tiangou* and *guixie*? Some bring success through the son, others ruin through the proper way. Even the *Changes* at its most profound cannot address these matters.\n\nNext, ask the masters of the *Spring and Autumn*, the Four Books, the *Book of Songs*, and the Three Ritual Classics—none will be able to answer. They will all say: “These are entirely unrecorded in the orthodox classics; only Wu Xian, Gan Gong, Shi Shen, and Hai Zhong’s Xi Meng recorded them in the *Seven Luminaries*.”\n\nShall I then ask: Are these six schools’ works to be considered teachings of the classics? They will answer: No. I shall further ask: Are Gan and Shi and their like sages? They too will answer: No. Yet if one is born beneath heaven and grows old upon the earth, seeking these things in the Five Classics yields nothing; searching in the books of Zhou and Confucius brings no result. Should we then dismiss them all as false and delusory?\n\nThe world is vast beyond measure, and even what meets the eye cannot be fully grasped—how much less the mysteries within mysteries, the subtleties beyond all subtlety? Again, I ask the common folk: Are there not lands where chariots ride clouds and jade is born from the earth? Peoples whose livers and hearts never decay? Those who dwell in nests or caves, who have but one eye or three heads, or whose bodies are like horses’ manes or dogs’ hooves? Beings with elongated arms crossing their thighs, or yellow pools where no men exist? Those with pierced chests or laboring mouths, who build granaries upon stone or rise from sand dunes? Do not dragons and women, Nü Wa and Gong Gong, emerge from the earth, piercing the heavens? Do not falling tiles take flight, and grand words resound? Do mountains shift and altars move? Do entire armies transform in a single morning—nobles into cranes, commoners into sand? Do not the ugly lean upon withered trees, while the Two Fu embrace pillars, and the lodger guards against collapse? The two-headed snake, the bow of *chun* wood, the unburning timber, the unextinguished fire, the birds of Changshu, the eyeless beasts, the headless bodies, the formless trunks? Does not Jingwei fill the sea, do not trees yield their places in turn, does not fire-washed cloth exist, the knife that cuts jade? Does not Yanmei spit flames, does not grinding mud strain water, does not withered wood revive when watered, does not form change upon mountains? The nine-headed *Xiu*, the *Bifang* bird, the *Ren Yu*, the *Shao Qian*’s exorcism, the *Bo Shuai*’s service to the sage minister, the *Su Shuang*’s frost over the western Qiang, the rise of the Xianbei through riding turtles, the strength of Linyi through divine records, the rule of Yongshu through floating corpses, the divine marriage of Emperor Jian, the flying *Zongmu*—do not these transform the world in the peaks of Jing? Did not the Five Ding lure the serpent to topple the mountains, while within, wings beat across the three seas? Were not the golden slips and jade characters revealed beside Yu’s Well? The true mechanism, the balanced scale, the cleaving within patterned stone—are not these marvels numbered in the thousands? Yet the Five Classics do not record them, and Zhou and Confucius do not speak of them. Should we then declare they never occurred?\n\nConsider further: The southerners who enter pillars and exit through their ears; those who halt bandits by stopping water with their elbows and shoot arrows with their arms; Bohun who treads cliffs of ten thousand *ren* yet stands on tiptoe; Lü Liang who walks singing over abysses; Duke Song who carved mulberry leaves to deceive the eye; Gongshu Ban whose wooden kites soared; Li Zhu who discerned the tip of a hair at a hundred paces; Ben and Huo who displayed their strength with ten thousand *jun*; the man of Yue who revived the dead with a needle; Shu Hai who leapt over a thousand paces; the craftsman of Ying who swung his axe at the whitewash on his nose—did not Zhong Du bare his body in freezing weather? None of these could Zhou or Confucius perform. Can we then claim they do not exist?\n\nIf the sage truly has limits, then it is no wonder he did not attain immortality. And if he did not attain immortality, this does no harm to his sageliness. The sage may simply not have mastered such arts—why make this the basis of attack? The sage may choose not to follow the same path, letting nature take its course. He has a body but does not claim it as his own; he has life but does not strive to preserve it. He entrusts life and death to heaven, accepts long and short as fate—so why should it be strange that he did not study immortality?\n\n**On the Meaning of the Dao, Ninth**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: The Dao encompasses heaven and embraces earth, yet in its origin it has no name. To speak of its nonbeing, even echoes and shadows are more substantial than it. To speak of its being, even the myriad things are as nothing before it. Fu Xi could not reckon its multitude, Li Zhu could not perceive its likeness, Wu Zha and Jin Ye could not fathom its sounds. Within the six directions, the *huanxi* and *huanzhu* beasts run swiftly yet cannot trace its signs. Beyond the cosmos, in nearness it flows through autumn down yet remains inexhaustible; in farness it pervades the great void yet is not filled.\n\nThe sound’s sound, the echo’s echo, the form’s form, the shadow’s shadow—what is square attains stillness through it, what is round attains motion; what descends attains prostration, what ascends attains reverence. To forcibly name it as the Dao is already to lose its truth, let alone dissecting it a thousand times, dividing it a hundredfold, or splitting it into ten thousand parts—its nature thereby reduced to boundlessness, how far then does it stray from the Dao!\n\nThe common folk cannot recognize the original root of the Great Beginning and instead cultivate its decadent branches. Those who can remain serene and joyful, unstained and unshaken, nurture their minds with desirelessness and preserve their spirits with purity; they sweep away temptations and return to rectitude, dispel thoughts of hard-to-attain things, cast off burdens that harm the true, temper the aberrations of joy and anger, and extinguish the roots of love and aversion. Then, without seeking blessings, blessings come; without averting misfortune, misfortune departs.\n\nWhy is this so? Because destiny lies within, not dependent on externals; the Dao abides here, with no need to await that. Alas! Ordinary people cannot preserve the true: lacking the restraint of barriers, they are swayed by desires and attachments, galloping in dissipation, lost without return. Their emotions stir in response to things, their wisdom overflows in engagement with affairs; seduced by what can be desired, the heavenly principle is extinguished. Deluded by what they see and hear, their purity is corrupted. Their minds are enslaved by extravagance, their spirits muddled by turbulence. Thus, they bring upon themselves calamities of ruin and misfortunes of irretrievable collapse. Yet all they do is slaughter fattened beasts, offer rich libations, strike gongs and drums, sing and dance, prostrate themselves, and kowtow, sitting in stillness and emptiness to beg for blessings, hoping for their fulfillment—until death, they never awaken. How pitiful!\n\nMoreover, their vital essence is exhausted by vexations, their constructive and defensive *qi* depleted by toil. Their form and *qi* are scorched and worn, their heavenly harmony eroded; labor and rest are imbalanced, and their heads are shattered in supplication. Illness arises in the marrow, yet they pray for healing; they lie in wind and dampness, apologizing to spirits, or disrupt their diet and blame demons. Such a frail body brings these afflictions upon itself—what aid can heaven, earth, or the gods provide? What use are their exhaustive sacrifices of livestock?\n\nFor blessings are not obtained through obsequious entreaty.\n\nDisasters are not averted through solemn sacrifices. If fate could be prolonged by repeated prayers and illness dispelled by lavish offerings, then the wealthy would surely live forever and the noble would never fall ill. Yet the gods do not accept sacrifices from those outside their lineage, nor do demons partake of wanton rites. The lanes of the poor cannot attract the golden chariots of the highborn, nor can the gates of commoners stir the six-horse teams of the noble. All share the same human form, yet their stations are worlds apart—how much more so with the celestial gods, distant and exalted, whose nature differs entirely? Their majesty is absolute; surely they cannot be moved by the stinking wine and meager dishes of the vulgar, nor by the bowing and scraping of the common folk. This much is clear.\n\nThose who are disloyal and unfilial commit the gravest of sins. Even if they offer bribes of a thousand gold or feasts of the finest cattle to a wise ruler, they cannot erase their infamy or absolve their guilt before the state. If men cannot absolve men, how much less can one hope to gain long life or cure grave illness through such means? The gods are of a different order, upright and just; to expect their partial favor is delusion. A ruler ashamed of his own failings or a minister who endures disgrace can still reward the good without bribes and punish the wicked without bias, adhering strictly to law without favor or prejudice. How much more so with the gods, who surpass men immeasurably? They cannot be swayed by clever words or bribes in disguise. The lesson is plain.\n\nKing Ling of Chu personally performed as a shaman, sparing no sacrifice, yet could not repel the Wu army’s invasion. The Prince of Guangling in Han exhausted his treasury in devotion to Li Ban, yet could not escape the punishment for rebellion. Emperor Wen, though he revered the gods with unstinting rites, could not avoid his death at Five Oaks. Sun Zhu, despite his noble rank and the enfeoffment of Hua Xiang, could not prolong his allotted span. It was not that their sacrifices were meager or their jades and silks insufficient; their sincerity was not lacking, nor was their reverence shallow. They suffered mountains of loss yet gained not a hair’s benefit. Is this not a case of neglecting what lies near while chasing what is far?\n\nWhen the Fifth Duke eradicated sorcerous ways, he lived long and prospered. When Lujiang of Song abolished mountain sacrifices, his blessings and fortune endured. When Wen Weng destroyed the shrine of the Water Spirit, he enjoyed personal safety and the people’s peace. When the Martial Emperor of Wei banned wanton rites, great fortune followed. These past events are no falsehood—they serve as mirrors for the future.\n\nVirtue alone is fragrant; those without care live long. Frugality preserves life, while excess invites early death. To follow the natural course is to age in health; external forces are of no avail. If one’s nurturing is imbalanced and depletion unchecked, a hundred ailments take root, and the constructive and defensive *qi* wither away. What use then are the grand sacrifices of the three beasts?\n\nThe customs of the day are rife with deceit, each fraud begetting another, growing ever more entrenched. The people, unable to cure their illnesses or awaken from their delusions, abandon the remedies of medicine and stone, clinging instead to the folly of prayers and sacrifices. They beseech without end, consult oracles without wearying. The petty sorcerers and shamans spin tales of calamity and possession, of illness and crisis—nothing is beyond their fabrication. At their behest, the people exhaust their wealth: the rich deplete their stores, the poor borrow at usurious rates, selling their fields and homes until their coffers are empty. If by chance they recover, they credit the gods; if they die, they blame the demons’ refusal to pardon. Should they survive by luck, their fortunes are spent, leaving them to freeze and starve. Some turn to banditry or burglary, meeting their end at the tip of an arrow or under the blade of the executioner, their bodies disgraced by punishment—all due to these very practices.\n\nSome squander all their possessions on sacrificial expenses, their grain and silk consumed by greedy shamans. When the shamans die, there is no money left for coffins or shrouds, and their corpses rot in the open—a pitiable end. How deep is the blindness of the foolish people!\n\nWanton rites and sorcerous deceit are forbidden by ritual and law, yet the common folk remain obstinate in their delusion. It falls to the ruler to sharpen the laws: let no offense, great or small, escape the death penalty. Offer bounties for the capture of shamans who refuse to cease, and execute them without mercy, displaying their bodies in the marketplace. In time, such practices will surely be eradicated. This is no small kindness—it will cut off the source of hunger and cold, stifle the sprouts of theft and banditry.\n\nIn times past, there were men like Zhang Jiao, Liu Gen, Wang Xin, and Li Shen, who claimed to be a thousand years old, peddling petty tricks—appearing and vanishing at will, changing their forms and faces—to deceive the common folk. They gathered the foolish, forming bands of rebels. Their aims were not to prolong life or cure illness, but to amass treacherous followers and stir up rebellion. Soon enough, they met their just deserts, some even bringing ruin to the innocent. Others swindled the people for wealth, amassing mountains of money and silk, surpassing even the nobility in riches. They indulged in extravagance and debauchery, feasting on delicacies, their chambers filled with concubines, their halls lined with musicians, their service manned by assassins and desperadoes. Their power overshadowed local lords, their might intimidated officials, and fugitives found refuge in their dens. All this stemmed from the failure of authorities to suppress them—truly a cause for lament.\n\nThough we common folk may see the truth, without office, what can we do? Those who govern fear that banning such practices might invite divine retribution. Even if some officials harbor doubts, they hesitate to act, deeming it a matter of secondary importance, not urgent enough to risk their careers. Their foolish wives and stubborn children cling to these beliefs, and their underlings, fearing to offend, echo their warnings. Thus, hesitation prevails, and none dare act—how maddening!\n\nI have personally known several men who never worshipped the gods or offered prayers, yet lived long lives, attained high rank, and saw their descendants flourish in wealth and nobility.\n\nFor my part, I have no business with such matters, observing only the seasonal sacrifices to my ancestors. I have traveled by land and water for ten thousand *li*, passing by no fewer than a hundred shrines and temples along the way. Yet on every journey, I have paid them no heed, and my carriages have never overturned, nor have I encountered storms while crossing rivers. Though I have often faced epidemics, I have always found the aid of medicine. Though I have braved arrows and blades, I have suffered no wounds. This only confirms the powerlessness of gods and demons.\n\nAmong the hundred-odd sorcerous sects, all but the Way of Li indulge in blood sacrifices. The latter, though it spares lives, still demands lavish offerings for its rituals—no expense is spared in procuring the finest and freshest provisions. Feeding dozens of people, their kitchen costs are no small matter.\n\nMoreover, these practices are not purely simple or frugal—all such sects rightfully belong on the list of those to be banned and eradicated.\n\nSomeone asked, \"When did the Way of Li originate?\" I replied: During the reign of Emperor Da of Wu, there was a man from Shu named Li A who dwelt in caves and ate nothing. He lived for generations, and those who saw him called him the \"Eight-Hundred-Year Elder.\" People often came to consult him, but Li A never spoke; he merely observed their countenance. If their expression was joyful, all matters would be auspicious. If their face bore sorrow, all matters required caution. If Li A smiled, great fortune would follow; if he sighed in warning, deep misfortune lay ahead. Such omens never once failed.\n\nLater, one day, he suddenly vanished without a trace. Afterward, a man named Li Kuan arrived in Wu from Shu. Fluent in the Shu dialect, he could chant incantations over water to cure illnesses, and many were healed. Thus, people far and near unanimously declared Kuan to be Li A and called him \"Li Eight-Hundred,\" though in truth he was not. From high ministers to commoners, none failed to flock to his door. Later, he grew arrogant and noble, no longer granting regular audiences. Visitors could only bow at his outer gate before departing. Such was his strangeness and eccentricity.\n\nOfficials evading service and commoners alike took Kuan as their master, numbering nearly a thousand. Yet those who advanced to the inner chambers and attained high mastery learned nothing more than chanting over water, the Three Section Talismans, and the circulation of solar and lunar *qi*—daily practices devoid of the essential methods for cultivating the body, ingesting divine medicines, or attaining longevity and immortality. Breath ingestion and grain avoidance could sustain one for a hundred days or so, but no longer—such was the shallowness of his arts.\n\nMany of my acquaintances who had met Kuan attested that he grew frail and decrepit with age, coughing and sighing, his eyes dim, ears deaf, teeth fallen, and hair white. Gradually, his mind dulled, and he forgot his own children and grandchildren, no different from an ordinary man. Yet the people insisted that Kuan feigned infirmity to deceive them—could this truly be so?\n\nOnce, Wu suffered a great epidemic, and over half the population perished. The chamber where Kuan practiced his Way was called a \"lodge.\" During the outbreak, Kuan himself contracted a febrile illness. Claiming to enter the lodge for purification and fasting, he died within it. Yet his followers still insisted he had transformed his form and achieved *shijie*—a corpse-liberated immortal—not truly dead.\n\nThe distinction of the divine immortals' methods lies precisely in their transcendence of aging and death. Now, Kuan aged and died—this alone proves he had not attained the Dao. What further doubt could there be? If, by the standards of immortal arts, one ought to achieve *shijie*, why not remain among the people for a century or two, living without death, before departing? The Dao of immortality is not absent in this world—Kuan was simply not the one to attain it.\n\nI have discussed Kuan’s case in such detail because his disciples, passing down their teachings to one another, have spread throughout the lands south of the Yangtze, numbering in the thousands. Unaware of the shallowness of Kuan’s methods and unworthy of their adherence, they cling to them in hopes of transcending the world. My aim is to awaken people to this delusion and dispel their stubborn confusion.\n\nIn the world, things that seem true but are false are countless. Let me briefly recount a few stories to enlighten those who fail to understand.\n\nLong ago in Runan, a man set snares in the fields to trap roe deer. After leaving, he still worried about retrieving his catch, though he neglected to tend to the traps. A fisherman passing by saw them and, placing a salted fish in one of the snares, departed. When the owner returned and found the fish, he was astonished, believing it to be a divine omen. Afraid to take it home, he spread the word among the villagers. Together, they built a shrine and established a temple, naming it the \"Lord Bao.\" Over time, more devotees gathered—red pillars, painted beams, and unceasing bells and drums. If someone’s illness happened to improve, they claimed it was the work of the divine. Travelers passing by never failed to make offerings. After seven or eight years, the fisherman returned to the temple and asked about its origins. When the villagers explained, he said, \"This is merely my salted fish. What divinity is there?\" And so the worship ceased.\n\nAnother tale: In Nandun, a man named Zhang Zhu was plowing a white field when he found a plum sapling in his path. Feeling pity for it, he wanted to take it home but, unable to dig it up at the moment, left it there, covering its roots with damp soil and placing it in a hollow mulberry tree before forgetting about it. Later, Zhang took a distant post and was away for some time. Meanwhile, the villagers noticed the plum tree suddenly growing in the mulberry and called it a miracle. A man with an eye ailment rested beneath the tree and prayed, \"Lord Li, if you heal my eyes, I will offer you a pig in thanks.\" When his eyes happened to improve, he slaughtered the pig and made his offering. Word spread, growing ever more exaggerated, until people claimed the tree could restore sight to the blind. From near and far, they came in droves to seek blessings—carriages and horses filled the roads, and wine and meat flowed like rivers. This continued for several years until Zhang returned from his post. Seeing the commotion, he said, \"This is merely the plum sapling I once planted. What divinity is there?\" He then cut down the tree, and the worship ended.\n\nMoreover, in Runan, there was a Peng family tomb near a major road, with a stone statue standing at its entrance. An old peasant woman, returning from the market with several cakes she had bought, passed by the tomb as the day grew hot. She placed the cakes on the statue’s head to rest beneath the trees, then hurried off and forgot to retrieve them. Travelers who saw the cakes on the stone statue’s head found it strange and asked about it. Someone claimed, \"This stone statue has divine power to heal illnesses, and those who recover offer cakes in thanks.\" The story spread, and people began saying, \"Those with headaches should rub the statue’s head, and those with stomachaches should rub its belly—even rubbing oneself after touching the statue brings healing.\" From a thousand *li* away, people came to seek treatment from the stone statue. At first, they offered only chickens and pigs, but later, they brought oxen and sheep, setting up tents and pavilions with a constant stream of visitors. This continued for several years until the old woman who had forgotten the cakes heard about it. She explained the truth to others, and no one returned to worship the statue.\n\nFurthermore, west of Luoyang, an ancient tomb had collapsed, filling with water. The tomb contained much lime, and the lime-infused water was effective for treating sores. One summer, a traveler suffering from sores, exhausted by the heat, saw the clear water in the tomb and bathed in it. His sores unexpectedly healed. Word spread, and all who were ill came to wash themselves. Some even drank the water to treat internal ailments. The people living near the tomb built a shrine there and sold the water. Those who came to buy it also made offerings at the shrine, with wine and meat flowing endlessly. As demand grew, the water was depleted, so the sellers secretly added other water at night to supplement it. Travelers from afar, unable to visit, sent messengers or entrusted others to buy the water for them. Thus, the sellers grew wealthy. Some claimed there was no divinity at work, and officials eventually prohibited the practice, filling in the tomb to stop it.\n\nIn Xinggu, a prefectural governor named Ma had a relative or old friend who sought his aid. Ma instructed the man to stay outside the city and pretended he was a divine Daoist healer, curing illnesses instantly with his touch. He also sent eloquent men to spread rumors, claiming he could restore sight to the blind and enable the lame to walk. Soon, people from all directions flocked to him like a marketplace, and his wealth in money and silk piled up like a mountain. He ordered all who sought healing—even if they were not immediately cured—to tell others they had recovered. This way, they would eventually heal; if they claimed otherwise, they would never recover. The method was infallible, and none dared doubt it. Thus, when later visitors asked earlier ones about their condition, they all said they had been cured. Within ten days, Ma’s relative amassed great wealth.\n\nMost people, though small-minded and foolish, dismiss methods for extending life and achieving longevity as empty fictions, yet readily believe in malevolent spirits and omens, dancing and praying to so-called gods—all of which are merely Ma’s deceptions to swindle people. I record these several cases as a warning to those who remain unaware.\n\nSomeone asked, \"Why are there those who, though ignorant of the Way, techniques, or arts, still live in peace and enjoy long lives?\"\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity replied: \"Such people may possess hidden virtues or good deeds that bring them blessings, or their fate may simply be long, allowing them to age slowly and die late. Some may also be fortunate enough to avoid disasters by chance—like game left behind in a hunt or grass and trees spared by a passing wildfire. To protect oneself and ward off harm, one should cultivate the arts of guarding the body, wear talismans of celestial patterns, and carry a sword. Ritual sacrifices and prayers are of no benefit; one should rely on one’s own inviolability, not on the forbearance of spirits. However, contemplating the mysterious and holding to unity, embracing the light and encircling the body, can repel evil and dispel misfortune, though it cannot extend life or cure bodily illnesses. Those who follow nature without techniques may still live out their natural years, yet they will have no means to resist violent spirits or great epidemics. Storing armor and stockpiling rain gear is like preparing for war or rain—if neither comes, their absence makes no difference. But when arrows and stones fill the air like mist and smoke, the unarmored will suffer; when torrential rains or blizzards strike, those standing in the open will struggle. One cannot dismiss the vast forces of yin and yang because of the insignificance of shepherd’s purse or wheat, lest later learners be misled into believing techniques are useless.\"\n\n**On Clarifying the Origin (Chapter Ten)**\n\nSomeone asked about the precedence of Confucianism and Daoism.\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity answered: \"The Dao is the root of Confucianism, and Confucianism is the branch of the Dao. The arts of yin and yang are full of taboos, making people timid and fearful. Confucianism is broad but lacks essentials, laborious yet unproductive. Mohism is frugal but hard to follow. Legalism is strict but unkind, harming benevolence and righteousness. Only the teachings of the Daoist school enable people to focus their spirit, move in harmony with non-action, encompass the strengths of Confucianism and Mohism, and summarize the essentials of Legalism. They adapt to changing times, respond to the transformations of things, are concise and easy to understand, require little effort yet yield great results, and aim to preserve the simplicity of the great origin and uphold the source of true integrity. Yet Ban Gu, following Sima Qian, placed the Yellow Emperor and Laozi before the Six Classics, calling Qian’s arrangement mistaken. Qian’s vast knowledge and comprehensive synthesis allowed him to sift through matters, verify the good and bad of events, and assess the uprightness of ancient figures. His evaluations truly stem from nature, and his praises and criticisms are all measured with care.\"\n\nThe ultimate principle neither falsely praises nor indiscriminately condemns, nor does it echo conventions merely to conform. Liu Xiang, a master scholar of his generation, called it a faithful record, yet Ban Gu’s judgments cannot be hastily accepted as correct. Ban Gu was indeed a pure Confucian, unversed in the intent of the Dao, and thus, constrained by his habitual learning, he could not strike the proper balance.\n\nWhat is meant by the Dao? Is it merely the matter of nurturing life? The *Yi Jing* states: \"The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang; the Dao of Earth is established as softness and hardness; the Dao of Man is established as benevolence and righteousness.\" It further says: \"The *Yi* contains the four Dao of the sage.\" Yet if the right person is not present, the Dao does not manifest in vain. It also says: \"In a flourishing and peaceful world, it is called having the Dao; in a perilous state with a chaotic ruler, it is called lacking the Dao.\" Again: \"To sit and discourse on the Dao is the role of the Three Dukes.\" In a state possessing the Dao, the poor and lowly feel shame.\n\nIn all discussions of the Dao, from the Two Modes above to the myriad things below, none do not proceed from it. Yet the Yellow Emperor and Laozi grasped its root, while the Confucians and Mohists managed its branches. Those today who are called masters of the Dao must broadly comprehend past and present, observe the heavens above and examine the earth below, traverse changes and cross boundaries, fathom the course of rise and fall, and grasp the essence of order and chaos. With minds free of confusion and answers to every question, why must they cultivate the methods of longevity or admire the martial prowess of Master Red Pine and Qiao? Yet the pedantic scholars, with their narrow views and arbitrary judgments, upon hearing of those who dwell in mountains and forests and follow the teachings of Bo Yang, deride and mock them, saying, \"Those are but minor arts, not worth considering.\"\n\nAlas!\n\nThose who clutch fireflies within cramped walls never witness the radiance of heaven’s light; those who consort with gudgeons and shrimp in shallow pools never know the vastness of the four seas. They weigh the depth of rivers and streams yet do not realize that what spews them forth is Kunlun; they prize the harvest of millet and panicled millet yet do not perceive that what brings forth their luxuriance is fertile soil.\n\nNow, if one merely extols Confucian arts yet does not know that what perfects them arises from the Dao—this Dao is what tempers the hundred schools, casts the Two Modes, gestates the myriad beings, and ferments the constant norms. In the world, the shallow and near are many, while the deep and far are few; the few cannot prevail over the many—this has been so for ages. Thus, though Sima Qian was profound, he was not praised; though Ban Gu was limited, he was not censured. Yet things are valued for their rarity and disdained for their abundance—how could human affairs be otherwise? Weeds blanket the plains while magic mushrooms seldom appear; thorns and brambles overrun the wilds while fragrant trees bloom but rarely. Sands and pebbles are countless, yet pearls and jades are scarce. Hawks and falcons swarm the skies, but phoenixes seldom take flight; vipers and lizards fill the marshes, yet dragons are rarely seen. That Ban Gu had many partisans is only fitting.\n\nThe Dao, when applied inwardly, governs the self; when extended outwardly, it orders the state. It ensures the Seven Governors follow their courses, the Two Qi harmonize, and the four seasons do not err in their cycles of cold and warmth. Wind and rain do not turn violent to become calamities for creatures. The Jade Candle heralds the signs of ascending peace; clear sweet wine manifests the tokens of virtue’s harmony. The burning wheel and rainbow lie dormant, their omens quelled; clouds of decay and Shangyang birds fold their wings. Splendor shines on high, auspicious grain gathers in abundance, pestilence does not spread, and disasters do not arise. Moats and ramparts are not built, shields and spears are not wielded. Without deliberation, all is fitting; without covenant, trust is firm; without binding, all is secure; without scheming, all is accomplished; without reward, all are encouraged; without punishment, all is solemn. What is sought is obtained without seeking; what is forbidden ceases without prohibition. Those above are not deemed burdensome; those ahead are not resented as troubles. Before a command is issued, customs shift; before an order is given, mores transform—such is the governance of the Dao.\n\nThus, when the Dao flourishes, the Three August Ones and Five Emperors ruled with folded arms, and all was more than sufficient.\n\nWhen the Dao declines, then Shun and Yu gallop in vain and all is insufficient. Only when there is sufficiency does non-action bring forth beautiful transformation; only when there is insufficiency do punishments grow harsh and villainy multiply. The common folk grieve below, the august spirits rage above. Some see floods surge wildly; some endure scorching droughts that parch the earth; some witness mountains and valleys shift their forms; some hear winter thunder and summer snow. Some see blood flow like drifting masts, corpses pile like city walls; some see trenches swallow tens of thousands, bones split and children exchanged. The higher the walls, the craftier the siege engines; the deeper the moats, the more ingenious the ladders. The clearer the laws, the more thieves and bandits; the more frequent the covenants, the worse the rebellions. Like fish and turtles stirred in the depths by stormy waves, like birds flustered in the marshes by fine nets, like beasts harried in the forests by packs of wolves, like minnows scorched in the cauldron by fierce flames—so it is when the Dao declines.\n\nThen rulers and ministers swap places; fathers and sons turn blades upon each other. Only then is loyalty and righteousness named in perilous states; only then do filial sons win praise in ruined households. Plagues arise, and shamans and physicians grow esteemed; the Dao and virtue wane, and the Confucians and Mohists gain weight. From this, the sequence of Confucianism and Daoism may be determined.\n\nSomeone asked: \"In former times, Master Red Pine, Wang Qiao, Qin Gao, Laozi, Peng Zu, Wu Cheng, and Yu Hua—all true persons—served in the world and did not flee to seclusion. Yet since the middle ages, those who pursue the Dao all vanish without trace into hidden valleys. Why is this?\"\n\nMaster Baopu replied: \"In ancient times, simplicity reigned and crafty falsity had not yet sprouted. Those who clearly trusted the Dao studied it diligently; those who did not trust it remained silent. Slanderous words were not spoken; malicious thoughts did not lodge in the breast.\"\n\nThus, true persons moved unhurried among the people, never hastening toward transcendence. In later ages, moral decay and artifice grew ever deeper; the transformative influence of the pure and tranquil waned, while the factions of perverse customs multiplied. Those who did not trust the Dao delighted in slander, calling the truly upright \"deviant\" and \"errant,\" dismissing divine transcendents as \"deluded\" and \"absurd.\" Some accused them of \"bewitching the masses,\" others of \"disrupting the social order.\" Therefore, the loftiest scholars felt shame in dwelling among them.\n\nIn former times, the perspicacious perceived the first signs of decline and fled at the slightest hint of danger, departing by night without waiting for dawn. They acted at the first glimpse of peril, not lingering until the day’s end. Thus, when Zhao plotted against Mingdu, Confucius turned his carriage back; when no sweet wine was offered, Musheng departed at once. If even Hua Yuan left such a place, how much more should the wise? Their pursuits and roots were fundamentally different—what attachment could they have to remaining there?\n\nWhen the deep pools dry and the marshes drain, the jiao-dragons no longer swim. When nests topple and eggs are gathered, the phoenixes no longer alight. When one dwells in a house where slander is spoken, the soaring gulls do not descend. When common plants are pruned in spring, the sacred mushrooms and lingzhi do not flourish. As vulgar customs vilify the upright and heap scorn upon them, how could those who possess the Dao not spread their wings and soar beyond? Would they not rather conceal their tracks in the boundless expanse of the unseen?\n\nThe mountains and forests are not the Dao itself, yet those who seek the Dao inevitably enter the mountains and forests. Truly, they wish to distance themselves from the foul stench of the world and draw near to this purity. Those who enter the nine chambers to refine their thoughts and preserve the true unity to summon the spirits do not delight in clamor or defilement. Those who compound the great elixir of golden cinnabar and refine the flying essence of the eight minerals particularly abhor the chatter of fools and the perceptions of the vulgar. When such disturbances arise, the numinous spirits do not descend, and the divine medicines do not form—this is no minor prohibition.\n\nIf one remains among people, shallow critics may slander them, officials may impose punishments or bestow favors, and relatives or old acquaintances may entangle them with celebrations or mourning. How much better to retreat to secluded valleys, entirely free from such verminous nuisances! Those who wander alone in the distant wilds find their joy in the towering peaks—is this not the reason?\n\nSome say: \"The highest scholars attain the Dao amid the three armies, the middling scholars attain it in the cities, and the lowest scholars attain it in the mountains and forests.\" This refers to those who have already completed the divine medicine but do not yet wish to ascend to heaven. Though they may be among the three armies, blades cannot harm them; though they may be in the cities, human calamities cannot touch them. The lowest scholars have not yet reached this stage, so they remain in the mountains and forests. It does not mean that those of the highest rank, when first learning the Dao, should dwell among the three armies or in the cities to attain it.\n\nThus, the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi could endure to this day without fading.\n\nSomeone asked: \"The Dao is the source, while Confucianism is but its later stream—I have already heard this teaching. But what, then, are the minor differences of the present age?\"\n\nGezhi Zibao (The Master Who Embraces Simplicity) said: The teachings of rising and descending, bowing and looking up; the rituals of three thousand refinements; the arts of attack and defense, advance and retreat; the discipline of lightening the body and esteeming righteousness; the matters of joy and sorrow, rites and music; and the strategies for governing the world and aiding the common people—these are the concerns of the Confucians. External things are discarded, the world is forsaken, scheming is cleansed away, wealth and nobility are forgotten, dissuasion and encouragement are cut off, and one does not grieve over poverty, nor rejoice in prosperity; neither does one sorrow in adversity nor delight in praise—these are the practices of the Daoists.\n\nConfucians perform sacrifices to pray for blessings, while Daoists walk in rectitude to ward off evil. What Confucians cherish is power and profit; what Daoists treasure is desirelessness. Confucians are ever eager for fame and gain, while Daoists embrace the One and cultivate solitude. What Confucians study are the ledgers of mutual scrutiny; what Daoists practice are the teachings of dispelling emotions and admonitions.\n\nAs for the Dao: in its becoming, it excels in self-cultivation to accomplish its tasks; in its dwelling, it excels in claiming what others do not contend for; in its governance, it excels in severing misfortune before it arises; in its bestowal, it excels in aiding beings without claiming virtue; in its movement, it excels in observing the people to apply its mind; in its stillness, it excels in abiding cautiously without distress. This is why it is the sovereign of the hundred schools and the ancestor of benevolence and righteousness. The minor differences in principle are thus compared—yet the fundamental rise and fall of its essence remains unchanged.\n\nSomeone said: The Confucians are Zhou and Kong; their texts are the Six Classics. They are the means by which the world is governed and rectitude preserved, the standards for establishing oneself and conducting affairs. Their use is far-reaching, their enterprise noble, their affairs grand, their words beautiful—they are the unchanging institutions for states and families. As for those who practice the Dao, they do not cultivate ritual teachings, nor regard great human relations. They consort with foxes and raccoons in the marshes, pair with apes and monkeys in the forests, solitary and drifting, taking trees and stones as neighbors. This is like the folly of the eastward-running rat or the sweetness of the sunflower—deluded and self-indulgent.\n\nGezhi Zibao replied: I do not esteem the display of flowers or the galloping of ornate words; I have long been sated with correcting the ignorant and rescuing the deluded. Truly, I do not wish to contend with you over the merits of principles or debate gains and losses at the tip of the tongue. Yet seeing a child fall into a well is not the intent of the benevolent; watching a blind man strike a pillar is not the heart of universal love. Thus, I briefly set forth an outline, roughly holding up one corner.\n\nThose who embody the Dao to craft things and treasure virtue to attain longevity follow the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. The Yellow Emperor governed the world and brought about great peace, yet he also ascended as an immortal—how can he be deemed inferior to Yao and Shun? Laozi both synthesized and administered teachings, yet he also attained long vision—how can he be considered lesser than Zhou or Kong? Thus, Confucius sighed in admiration, yet I have never heard him utter words of disparagement. That later generations of mediocre people, failing to enter its gate, practice Confucianism and Mohism while slandering Daoism—how is this different from descendants cursing their ancestors? They do not recognize their own origins; this is truly excessive.\n\nThe hands of a dwarf cannot topple Mount Song or Hua; the legs of a pygmy cannot fathom the vast sea. Yet I often see vulgar, tree-stump-clinging Confucians, narrowly absorbed in their studies, ignorant of broad principles, instructing the stubborn and commanding the foolish, adorning evil words to falsely interrogate Daoists. When they speak of the dregs of糟粕, it is as if they glimpse a swift horse passing a crack; when they wade into the abyss of the spirit, they drown and lose themselves. Like the sparrow flapping its short wings to ride the waves of the sunlit sea, or the fly straining its weak body to cross the peaks of the sun-monkey—tasks beyond their capacity, only hastening their distress. Yet they croak within their narrow confines, their ears unversed in the vast, their eyes unpenetrating of the distant. Aspiring to stand on tiptoe to encompass the Three Luminaries, drumming their bellies to stir lightning—how can their dullness not be obscured?\n\nOnly by ascending the distant mystery of the celestial sphere does one know the depths of the well and valley; only by beholding the brilliance of the great light in the heavens does one recognize the paltriness of the wren’s nest. I was not born with knowledge, nor did I believe in it from youth. At first, I too was as ignorant as you. Yet after observing the vastness of its profound secrets, I regret not escaping my ignorance sooner.\n\nThe affairs of the Five Classics are illuminated by commentaries and explanations, yet even beginners may not understand them—how much more so the golden tablets and jade slips of the divine immortals’ scriptures, the essential words that are often not written down? Only after ascending the altar and swearing blood oaths are the oral instructions transmitted. If one is not the right person, even if offered land split asunder, halls filled with gold and jade, they will not be casually shown.\n\nThough one may obtain the texts, without a teacher’s guidance, it is like looking up without seeing the head or looking down without knowing the feet—how could you, sir, be thoroughly familiar with this? Those who attain immortality may ascend to the Great Clarity, soar in the Purple Empyrean, reach the Mystic Isles, or dwell in the paulownia of the Celestial Hook’s music, feasting on nine-fold fungi. They carry pine and cassia beyond the inverted shadows, banquet in the Jasper Chambers of the Eternal Sun—why should they consort with foxes and raccoons or pair with apes and monkeys? This is what is called \"acting without knowledge.\" Such is the Dao.\n\nThose who roam freely amidst the rainbow’s arc, soaring through the cinnabar skies, traversing the vastness of the Six Voids—all is shaped by their intent. Though cast aside and left to drift, they feel no sorrow.\n\nGathered in herds, adorned in embroidered silks—yet when weighed against joy, how does this compare to the solitary flight of the untethered unicorn? The auspicious light parts from its mate, yet its fortune abounds.\n\n**Elixirs of Immortality, Chapter Eleven**\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: The *Divine Farmer’s Four Classics* says, \"Superior elixirs bring bodily peace, prolong life, and enable ascent as celestial spirits, roaming above and below, commanding the myriad spirits, growing feathers and wings, summoning traveling kitchens, and arriving in an instant.\" It further says, \"The Five Fungi, cinnabar, jade tablets, malachite, realgar, orpiment, mica, *Taiyi*’s leftover grain—each may be taken alone, all granting flight and longevity.\" It also says, \"Middle-grade elixirs nurture nature; lower-grade ones dispel illness. They render poisons powerless, keep fierce beasts at bay, ward off malign qi, and repel all malevolent spirits.\" The *Filial Classics’ Divine Concordance* states: \"Pepper and ginger repel dampness; calamus sharpens hearing; sesame prolongs life; *weixi* averts weapons—all are the utmost words of the supreme sages, the true records of esoteric arts.\"\n\nThe texts are clear and luminous, yet the world’s people ultimately do not believe—how lamentable!\n\nAmong elixirs of immortality, cinnabar ranks highest, followed by gold, then silver, then the various fungi, then the Five Jades, then mica, then luminous pearls, then realgar, then *Taiyi*’s leftover grain, then *shizhonghuangzi*, then *shigui*, then quartz, then *shinao*, then sulfur, then *shidan*, then malachite, then pine and cypress resin, *fuling*, rehmannia, *maimendong*, sesame, *chonglou*, coptis, *shiwei*, paper mulberry fruit, and *xiangchai* (also called *chunlu*). Some call it *xianrenzhang*, others *Queen Mother of the West’s Staff*, or *tianjing*, or *que lao*, or *digua*, or *gouqi*.\n\n*Tianmendong* is also called *dimendong*, *yanmendong*, *dianji*, *yinyangshi*, or *guansong*. That which grows in high places has short roots, a sweet taste, and fragrant qi—this is superior. That which grows by water or in lowlands has fine leaves resembling *yun*, yellowish bark, long roots, a bitter taste, and foul qi—this is inferior. It may still be consumed, but it tends to induce qi descent, though its benefits are slower. After a hundred days of consumption, one becomes robust, surpassing even those who take *zhu* or *huangjing*. Upon entering the mountains, it may be steamed or boiled and eaten to sate hunger, granting strength and enabling grain abstention. It may also be made into powder or its juice extracted for wine—consuming the powder is especially fine. The people of Chu call *tianmendong* *baibu*, yet there exists another *baibu* herb whose roots resemble a hundred clustered together, though their sprouts differ slightly. True *baibu* resembles *baxie* and is used only to treat coughs and repel lice—it is unsuitable for consumption and must not be mistaken. For example, *huangjing* is also called *baiji*, but it is not the *baiji* used to make paste. According to the *Materia Medica*, many herbs share names with others; only the meticulous and learned can distinguish them—one must be thorough.\n\n*Huangjing* is also called *yuzhu*, *jiuqiong*, or *chuizhu*. Consuming its flowers surpasses its fruit; consuming its fruit surpasses its roots. However, flowers are difficult to gather in quantity—ten *hu* of fresh flowers yield only five or six *dou* when dried. A daily dose of three *ge* requires great effort to prepare. Consuming *huangjing* for a mere decade yields substantial benefits. Both it and *zhu* enable grain abstention, but *zhu* nourishes strength, allowing one to bear heavy loads and traverse perilous paths. Yet it does not match *huangjing* in sweetness and ease of consumption, which can sustain the elderly and young during famines. Those unable to distinguish them mistake it for dried rice.\n\nThe Five Fungi comprise stone fungi, wood fungi, herb fungi, flesh fungi, and mushroom fungi—each with a hundred or so varieties.\n\n**Stone Fungi** resemble living creatures, growing on the shores of distant seas, famous mountains, and island cliffs where stones accumulate. They take the form of creatures with heads, tails, and four limbs—those resembling living beings are superior. They cling to large stones, favoring lofty peaks and perilous cliffs, often inverted or suspended. Red ones resemble coral, white ones like sliced fat, black ones like lacquer, green ones like kingfisher feathers, and yellow ones like purple gold—all are luminous and translucent like solid ice. On dark nights, their glow is visible from three hundred paces. Large ones weigh over ten *jin*; small ones, three or four *jin*. Without prolonged refinement, utmost essence, and the talismans of *Laozi’s* *Five Treasures of Lingbao*, one cannot encounter them. Upon seeing any fungus, first place the *Kaishan Jihai Fu* upon it to prevent it from vanishing or transforming. Then, on an auspicious day, perform a ritual with wine and dried meat, pray, and gather it by approaching from the sun’s direction, stepping with *Yubu*, and holding one’s breath. If one obtains a stone-simulacrum fungus, pound it thirty-six thousand times and consume a *fangcunbi* daily. Finishing one *jin* grants a thousand years; ten *jin*, ten thousand years. It may also be shared with others.\n\n**Jade-Fat Fungi** grow on jade-rich mountains, often in precarious places where jade sap flows. After ten thousand years, it congeals into fungi, sometimes resembling birds or beasts, though their forms and colors vary. Most resemble mountain *xuan* and water *cang* jade, lustrous as crystal. Ground into powder and mixed with *wuxincao* juice, it soon turns to liquid. Drinking one *sheng* grants a thousand years.\n\n**Seven Luminaries and Nine Radiance Fungi** are also stones, growing on high cliffs near water. They resemble plates or bowls, no larger than a *chi* in diameter, with stems rising three or four *cun*. Those with seven holes are called *Seven Luminaries*; those with nine, *Nine Radiance*. Their lights resemble stars, visible at night from over a hundred paces. Their glow is distinct—scatterable but not combinable. Gather them at the autumn equinox, pound them, and consume a *fangcunbi*. Upon entering the mouth, one’s body harmonizes with the five flavors, sweet and delicious. Consuming one *jin* grants a thousand years, bestowing a luminous body. In dark places, one sees as if by moonlight, enabling night vision.\n\n**Stone Toad Fungi** grow in the stone chambers of Shaoshi Mountain. Within the chambers lies a deep valley, impossible to cross. Tossing a stone into it, the sound echoes for half a day. Ten-odd *zhang* outside the chamber stands a stone pillar topped with a stone canopy, about a *zhang* tall and wide. The *toad* fungus emerges from the stone chamber, resting beneath the canopy, which never overflows.\n\nThe stone chamber’s entrance is carved with tadpole script, reading: *\"One who consumes a *dou* of Stone Toad Fungi shall live ten thousand years.\"* Daoist adepts have long pondered this place, yet none can reach it. The only method is to affix a bowl to the tip of sturdy bamboo or wood to catch it—but none have succeeded. Judging by the inscription, there must have been those in ancient times who obtained it.\n\n**Stone Cassia Fungi** grow in the stone caves of renowned mountains, resembling cassia trees but with stone-like fruit. About a *chi* tall and a *chi* in diameter, they glow and taste pungent, with branches. Pounding and consuming one *jin* grants a thousand years.\n\n**Stone Yellow Seeds** are found everywhere, but the Qin River Mountains yield the most. When embedded in large stones, the stone remains perpetually moist, never dry. Striking the stone dozens of times reveals them, nestled within like an egg in its shell. They must be consumed immediately—if left, they harden into stone and become unfit for ingestion. The proper method is to drink them before they solidify; once hardened, they should be ground into powder. Breaking open a stone may yield as much as a *sheng* or as little as a few *ge*, which can be consumed at once. Even if one cannot obtain much, continuous consumption—totaling three *sheng*—grants a thousand years. The only hindrance is their scarcity.\n\n**Stone Brain Fungi** grow within talc, resembling Stone Yellow Seeds but not always present. Breaking open a thousand or so large talc stones may yield one. When first split, it glows with five colors within the stone and moves of its own accord. Consuming one *sheng* grants a thousand years.\n\n**Stone Sulfur Fungi** are found on the Five Peaks, with Mount Ji yielding the most. According to local legend, Xu You consumed them here to attain longevity, freeing him from worldly concerns and allowing him to decline Yao’s abdication. Known as *Sulfur Elixir*, it is the red essence of stone sulfur, seeping from cliffs. The moist form can be rolled into pills, while the hardened form can be ground into powder. There are one hundred and twenty varieties of stone fungi, as recorded in the *Taiyi Jade Formula* and *Changyu Inner Records*, though they cannot all be enumerated here.\n\n**Wood Fungi** include *fuling*, formed when pine resin seeps into the earth and transforms over a thousand years. After ten thousand years, a small plant resembling a lotus flower grows atop it, called *Wood Might-Joy Fungi*. It glows at night, feels slippery to the touch, and does not burn when lit. Carrying it repels weapons: place a chicken wearing it among eleven others in a coop, then shoot twelve arrows from twelve paces away—the other chickens will be struck, but the one with the fungus remains unharmed. Harvest it from the *Gate of Life*, dry it in the shade for a hundred days, then grind and consume a *fangcunbi* three times daily. Consuming one entire fungus grants three thousand years.\n\n**Thousand-Year Cypress** has roots resembling a seated person, seven *cun* long. When carved, it bleeds. Applying its sap to the soles of the feet allows one to walk on water without sinking. Rubbing it inside the nostrils lets one enter water, which parts to allow dwelling at the riverbed. Applying it to the body grants the form of a dragon—desired visions appear upon wiping it away. It also cures illnesses: scrape and consume a *daogui* for internal ailments, or apply it to external swellings and pains, which vanish instantly. For example, if the left foot is afflicted, scrape the left foot of a figurine. Mixed with *jusheng* and shaped into a candle, its light reveals buried treasures—gold and jade—by turning green and bending downward. Digging with a spade uncovers them. Consuming ten *jin* of its powder grants a thousand years.\n\n**Flying Node Fungi** grow within the bark of three-thousand-year-old pine trees, resembling coiled dragons. The largest weigh ten *jin*. Consuming ten *jin* of its powder grants five hundred years.\n\n**Fan Peach Fungi** resemble ascending dragons, with flowers and leaves like red gauze and fruit like kingfishers. No taller than five *chi*, they grow on the shady sides of famous mountains near east-flowing springs. Harvested at the *Start of Summer*, their powder grants five thousand years when consumed entirely.\n\n**Triple-Union Fungi** are red and luminous. When struck, their branches and leaves chime like metal or stone, yet snap back together if broken. **Wood Channel Fungi** grow parasitically on large trees, resembling nine-stemmed lotus clusters, sweet and pungent. **Jian Wood Fungi** bear fruit in *Duguang*, their bark like *yingshe* vines and fruit like *luan* birds. Consuming any of these three grants ascent to heaven in broad daylight.\n\n**Yellow Reed Seeds**, **Prevention Wood Blossoms**, and **Mysterious Liquid Blossoms** grow on Mount Tai in Yaoxiang and Fenghao. Consuming them grants a thousand years.\n\n**Yellow Cedar Root Fungi** grow beneath yellow cedar trees, resembling three-*hu* vessels, connected to the main trunk by fine roots twenty to thirty *zhang* away, like threads. Consuming its powder entirely grants earthly immortality.\n\nThere are one hundred and twenty such varieties, each illustrated in accompanying diagrams.\n\n**Herb Fungi** include:\n- **Solitary Sway Fungi**, which move without wind. Their stems are finger-thick, red as cinnabar, with leaves like amaranth. The main root resembles a *dou*, with smaller roots like chicken eggs, twelve in total, encircling the main root like the twelve earthly branches. Each is a *zhang* apart, connected by fine roots like white hair. They grow atop high mountains and deep valleys, where no other plants thrive. Consuming the main root’s powder entirely grants a thousand years; consuming a smaller root grants a hundred years and can be shared with others. Carrying the main root grants a dragon’s form—turning it left reveals it.\n- **Ox-Horn Fungi**, found on Tiger Longevity Mountain and Wu Slope, resemble scallions but grow singularly like ox horns, three to four *chi* long and blue. Consuming a *fangcunbi* three times daily for a hundred days grants a thousand years.\n- **Dragon Immortal Fungi**, resembling ascending dragons with leaf-scales and roots like coiled dragons. Consuming one branch grants a thousand years.\n- **Hemp Mother Fungi**, resembling hemp but with red stems and purple flowers.\n- **Pearl Fungi**, with yellow flowers, red leaves, and purple fruit like plums, twenty-four hanging in strands like pearls.\n- **White Talisman Fungi**, four to five *chi* tall, resembling plum trees, blooming in heavy snow and fruiting in late winter.\n- **Vermilion Grass Fungi**, with nine bends, each bearing three leaves—each leaf representing three generations.\n\nThe **Five-Virtue Fungi** resemble towering halls, their square stems bearing leaves of five colors, each distinct and unmingled. Above, they form an inverted canopy, and within, sweet dew gathers while purple qi rises several *chi* high.\n\nThe **Dragon-Chariot Fungi** invariably sprout in pairs during mid-spring, with three nodes and twelve branches. Their roots resemble seated figures.\n\nThese herbal fungi number one hundred and twenty kinds in all. When dried in the shade and consumed, they enable one to endure as long as heaven and earth—some granting a thousand years, others two thousand.\n\nThe **Flesh Fungi** include:\n- The **Ten-Thousand-Year Toad**, which bears horns on its head and eight red characters inscribed beneath its chin. Heavy in body, it is captured at noon on the fifth day of the fifth month, then dried in the shade for a hundred days. Drawing on the ground with its left foot summons flowing water, while wearing its left hand on the body repels all weapons. Should an enemy shoot at one, the bow, crossbow, and arrows reverse course to strike the assailant.\n- The **Thousand-Year Bat**, white as snow, roosts upside down due to the weight of its brain.\n\nWhen these two creatures are dried in the shade, ground into powder, and consumed, they grant a lifespan of forty thousand years.\n\nThe **Thousand-Year Spirit-Turtle** displays all five colors. The male’s forehead bears two bony ridges resembling horns; bathing it in sheep’s blood allows one to scrape off its shell, which is then roasted over fire, ground, and consumed in *fangcunbi* doses thrice daily. Consuming one entire shell grants a thousand years.\n\nEncountering in the mountains small figures riding carriages or horses, seven or eight *cun* tall, signifies **Flesh Fungi**. Capturing and consuming them bestows immortality.\n\nThe **Wind-Born Beast** resembles a leopard, blue in color and the size of a wildcat, dwelling in the great forests of the Southern Sea. To capture it, hunters gather cartloads of firewood and set it ablaze. When the wood is consumed, the beast remains unscathed amid the ashes, its fur unburned and impervious to blades or piercing. Striking it feels like beating a leather sack; only after forging it with an iron hammer for thousands of blows does it die. Upon death, it gapes toward the wind, and in moments revives and flees. Plugging its nostrils with *Acorus* from a stone causes it to die. Its brain, mixed with chrysanthemum and consumed—ten *jin* in total—grants five hundred years.\n\nThe **Thousand-Year Swallow** nests with its entrance facing north, its plumage mostly white with a forked tail. When dug up, dried in the shade, and ground into powder, consuming one grants five hundred years.\n\nThese, too, number one hundred and twenty kinds, all classified as **Flesh Fungi**.\n\nThe **Mushroom Fungi** grow in deep mountains, beneath great trees, or beside springs. Their forms vary—some like palaces, others like carriages or horses, dragons or tigers, human figures, or flying birds—shifting in color without constancy. They, too, number one hundred and twenty kinds, each depicted in illustrations. To gather them, one must perform the **Yu Step**, cut them with a bone knife, dry them in the shade, grind them into powder, and consume a *fangcunbi* dose. The superior varieties confer several thousand years, the lesser a thousand.\n\nTo seek fungal herbs in famous mountains, one must enter during the third or ninth month—when the mountains open to yield divine medicines. Avoid inauspicious days; instead, choose times of **Heavenly Assistance** or the **Three Auspicious** for added protection. On reaching the mountain, select a **Six Yin Day** during the **Hall of Light** hour. Carry a **Lingbao Talisman**, lead a white dog, hold a white chicken, and bring a *dou* of white salt along with an **Opening Mountain Talisman** and memorial, placing them on a large stone. Hold a bunch of **Wu Tang Grass** (or flowers) to enter the mountain, for the mountain spirits delight in this and will grant success.\n\nWhen gathering or consuming fungi, choose days when the **Celestial Stems and Earthly Branches** align in mutual generation for optimal harmony.\n\nThese fungi abound in famous mountains, yet ordinary Daoists—lacking single-minded devotion, deficient in virtue, and ignorant of mountain-entry techniques—may possess the illustrations but fail to recognize the fungi, thus never obtaining them. Mountains, regardless of size, are guarded by **Guai Spirits**, who do not bestow fungi upon the unworthy. Even if one treads upon them, they remain invisible.\n\n**Mica** has five varieties, though most cannot distinguish them. The method: hold it toward the sun, carefully observe its hues, and discern its nature. Viewing it in the shade reveals no mixed colors.\n\n- When all five colors are present but green dominates, it is **Yunying** (Cloud Essence), best consumed in spring.\n- When all five colors are present but red dominates, it is **Yunzhu** (Cloud Pearl), best consumed in summer.\n- When all five colors are present but white dominates, it is **Yunye** (Cloud Liquid), best consumed in autumn.\n- When all five colors are present but black dominates, it is **Yunmu** (Cloud Mother), best consumed in winter.\n- When only green and yellow appear, it is **Yunsha** (Cloud Sand), best consumed in late summer.\n- Pure white and lustrous mica is **Linshi** (Phosphorus Stone), suitable for consumption in all seasons.\n\nMethods for refining the **Five Clouds**:\n- Infuse with cassia, scallion, or jade to transform into water.\n- Steep in dew within an iron vessel, then simmer with **Xuan Water** to produce liquid.\n- Seal with saltpeter in a tube and bury to create water.\n- Knead into curd.\n- Soak in autumn dew for a hundred days, then pound in a leather pouch to make powder.\n- Mix with **Wudian Grass** and *Ailanthus* blood for consumption.\n\nConsuming it for a year cures all illnesses; for three years, an old man reverts to youth; for five years, one commands **Guai Spirits**, walks through fire unburned, enters water unsoaked, and treads thorns unharmed, meeting immortals. Other substances char when buried, but the **Five Clouds** remain unburned even in raging fires and never decay, thus granting longevity.\n\nAfter ten years of consumption, clouds perpetually shroud one’s head. Consuming the mother (Yunmu) begets the child (other varieties)—a natural principle.\n\nWhen held toward the sun, if a murky, pure black hue appears, it is unfit for consumption, causing illness, strangury, sores, and other afflictions. Even when prepared as water or powder, it must first be soaked for a hundred days in water from thatched roofs, east-flowing streams, or dew, then washed to remove impurities before use.\n\n**Wei Shuqing** of Zhongshan consumed it for years, eventually riding clouds. He sealed the formula in a jade box, and after ascending, his son **Shi** and the Han envoy **Liang Bo** obtained it, followed the method, and likewise attained immortality.\n\n**Realgar** must come from Wudu Mountain, pure and unadulterated, its red hue like a rooster’s comb, radiant and gleaming. Only this is suitable for immortality elixirs. Pure yellow realgar lacking red luster is unfit for immortality but may be used in medicinal compounds.\n\nMethods of consumption:\n- Steaming or boiling.\n- Mixing with wine.\n- Dissolving with saltpeter into water, then solidifying.\n- Wrapping in **Xuan Intestines**, steaming beneath red earth.\n- Blending with pine resin.\n- Refining with three substances to draw it out like cloth, white as ice.\n\nConsumption grants longevity, cures all diseases, expels the **Three Corpses**, erases scars, restores black hair, and regrows fallen teeth. After a thousand days, **Jade Maidens** attend, ready to serve and summon traveling kitchens. The Jade Maidens always bear a yellow jade mark on their noses, the size of millet—a sign of authenticity.\n\nThose lacking this mark are but demons testing men. Jade, too, is an immortality elixir, though difficult to obtain. The *Scripture of Jade* states: \"He who consumes gold attains longevity like gold; he who consumes jade attains longevity like jade.\" It further says: \"He who ingests the **Mysterious Perfection** knows no end to his life.\" The **Mysterious Perfection** is another name for jade. Its consumption enables the body to become light and ascend—yet this is not merely earthbound immortality. However, the Way is slow to manifest; only after consuming one or two hundred *jin* does one begin to perceive its effects.\n\nJade may be dissolved into water using **Black Rice Wine** or **Sanguisorba Wine**, or melted into a paste with scallion broth. It may also be ingested as pills or burned into powder. After a year of consumption, one becomes impervious to water, fire, blades, and all poisons. Yet one must not use jade that has already been fashioned into vessels, for it harms without benefit—only unworked jade (*pu* jade) is suitable.\n\nThe finest jade comes from Khotan, particularly the white variety. Next in quality is the jade from the borders of Xuyanting in Nanyang, as well as that from the waters of Lurong in Rinan. **Master Red Pine** soaked jade in **Mysterious Worm** blood to transform it into liquid, which he then consumed—thus enabling him to ride the smoke and ascend or descend at will.\n\nWhile jade shavings, whether taken dry or dissolved in water, grant immortality, they are inferior to gold in that they frequently induce **cold-food powder**-like symptoms, such as outbreaks of sores. To prevent this, those who consume jade shavings should take, every ten days, a *daorui* each of realgar and cinnabar. Afterward, they should bathe, wash their hair, and walk against the wind in cold water to avert the outbreaks.\n\nDong Junyi once gave **Jade Elixir** to a blind man, whose sight was restored within ten days. There was also Wu Yanzhi, who was determined to consume jade. Though he obtained the *Scripture of Jade* and its methods, he did not fully grasp its regulations and prohibitions. He gathered a vast quantity of ritual tablets, rings, discs, and even the fittings of swords, intending to refine and ingest them. After I explained that these were unsuitable, he sighed and said, \"This matter cannot be approached without precision—not only is it futile, but it may even invite disaster.\"\n\nSilver, while inferior to gold and jade, may still confer earthbound immortality.\n\nThe method of ingestion involves dissolving it in wheat broth, or consuming it with wine infused with *zhu* grass, or refining it with dragon fat. However, after three doses, it becomes as large as a pellet—something beyond the means of impoverished Daoist practitioners. Pearls measuring over an inch in diameter may also be consumed, granting longevity. Soaked in yogurt or broth, they dissolve like liquid mercury; alternatively, they may be dissolved in *fushi* water or *ke* water, then wrapped in *tongshe* yellow and combined to form strands three or four feet long. Ingested as pills, they enable fasting and confer immortality.\n\nPure lacquer that does not adhere may be consumed to commune with spirits and attain longevity. The method of ingestion involves either mixing it with ten large crabs (also called \"the gutless lord\") or combining it with mica-infused water or jade-infused water. After consumption, the nine worms are expelled, and foul blood departs through the nose. Within a year, the Six Jia spirits will provide divine sustenance. Cinnamon may be steamed with scallion juice to produce a liquid, or consumed with bamboo sap, or mixed with *xianzhi* stone brain (also called *xuan*). After seven years of ingestion, one may walk upon water and achieve immortality.\n\n*Jusheng* (also called sesame) prevents aging, resists wind and dampness, and replenishes vitality in the elderly. Peach resin, soaked in mulberry ash water and consumed, cures all illnesses; prolonged ingestion lightens the body and grants luminosity, so that in dark nights, one shines like the moon. Excessive consumption enables fasting. The red fruit of the *ning* (or *chu*) tree, ingested for a year, restores youth to the elderly and grants clear vision, revealing spirits. The Daoist Liang Xu, at seventy, consumed it and grew younger, reaching 140 years of age. He could write at night and outrun horses, later ascending to Green Dragon Mountain. *Huaizi* seeds should be sealed in a new jar with mud for over twenty days until their outer skin rots, then washed to resemble large soybeans. Daily consumption nourishes the brain, prevents graying hair, and grants longevity. Among the three hundred-odd herbs in the *Xuan Zhong Man Fang*, such as *Chu feilian*, *zexie*, *dihuang*, and *huanglian*, all extend lifespan and may be consumed individually.\n\nThe *Lingfei Powder*, *Weiyang Pill*, *Zhiming Pill*, and *Yangxue Pill* all preserve youth and reverse aging. In the mountains of Lixian County, Nanyang, there is a Sweet Valley Brook, whose sweetness arises from the surrounding sweet chrysanthemums. Their blossoms fall into the water over generations, altering its taste. The residents near this valley do not dig wells but drink solely from the Sweet Valley Brook. None fail to live long lives—some reach 140 or 150 years, while the youngest live to eighty or ninety, with no premature deaths. This is due to the power of the chrysanthemums.\n\nThus, when the Minister of Ceremonies Wang Chang, the Grand Commandant Liu Kuan, and the Grand Tutor Yuan Wei served as governors of Nanyang, they each ordered Lixian County to deliver forty *hu* of Sweet Valley water monthly for their consumption. Though these officials suffered from wind impediment and dim vision, their conditions improved. However, they did not reap the full benefits as did the valley’s residents, who had consumed the water since birth.\n\nChrysanthemums resemble *yiyi* flowers but are distinguished by taste—chrysanthemums are sweet, while *yiyi* are bitter, as the saying goes, \"bitter as *yiyi*.\" True chrysanthemums exist everywhere but are rare. They mostly grow near water, with the greatest abundance in Goushi and Lixian. The *Xian Fang* refers to the \"Essence of the Sun\" and \"Ever-Full,\" both names for a single chrysanthemum with differing roots, stems, flowers, and fruits. The descriptions are elegant, yet recent attempts at consumption have yielded no effect, precisely because true chrysanthemums were not obtained. If even Sweet Valley water, imbued with chrysanthemum essence, grants longevity to its residents, how much more so with superior herbs?\n\nMy late grandfather, the Vice Minister of Ceremonies, once served as magistrate of Linhang County. He recounted that the Liao family in the county had lived long lives for generations—some reaching a hundred, others eighty or ninety. After they relocated, their descendants suffered early deaths. When others occupied their former residence, longevity returned over generations. This suggested the house itself was the cause, though its reason was unknown. Suspecting the well water was unusually red, they excavated around it and unearthed several dozen *hu* of cinnabar buried by ancients a few feet away. The cinnabar’s essence had gradually seeped into the well, so drinking its water conferred longevity. How much more so if one refined and ingested cinnabar directly?\n\nI have also heard of Zhao Qu from Shangdang, who suffered from leprosy for years. Despite numerous treatments, his condition worsened, and death seemed imminent. His family, despairing, abandoned him in a mountain cave. Qu, lamenting his misfortune, wept day and night. After a month, an immortal passed by the cave, took pity on him, and inquired about his plight. Qu, recognizing the immortal’s extraordinary nature, kowtowed and pleaded for mercy. The immortal gave him a pouch of medicine with instructions for consumption. After a hundred days, Qu’s sores healed, his complexion became radiant, and his skin smooth as jade. The immortal revisited him, and Qu expressed gratitude for the gift of life, begging for the formula. The immortal replied, \"This is merely pine resin. This mountain abounds with it. Refine and consume it to attain immortality.\" Qu returned home, where his family, initially mistaking him for a ghost, were astonished. He then consumed pine resin continuously, his body growing lighter, his strength increasing a hundredfold. He could scale perilous heights and traverse rugged terrain all day without fatigue. At 170, his teeth remained intact, his hair unwhite. One night, he suddenly saw a light in his room, bright as a mirror. When he asked his attendants, they saw nothing. Over time, the light expanded until the entire room shone as if by daylight. Another night, he saw two tiny maidens, two or three inches tall, with fully formed faces and bodies, playing around his nose and mouth. After a year, the maidens grew larger and stood beside him. He often heard the sounds of zithers and lutes, laughing joyfully to himself. After over three hundred years among mortals, his appearance remained that of a youth. He then entered Baodu Mountain—undoubtedly an earthbound immortal.\n\nAt the time, news of Qu’s consumption of pine resin spread, and many rushed to gather it. The industrious transported it by cart and donkey, filling entire rooms. Yet most who consumed it stopped after a month, perceiving no significant benefit. Such perseverance is rare.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han, hunters in the Zhongnan Mountains encountered a person without clothing, their body covered in black hair. The hunters pursued them, but the figure leapt over gullies and valleys as if flying, impossible to overtake. The hunters then secretly observed their location, surrounded them, and captured them—only to discover it was a woman. When questioned, she said, \"I was originally a palace woman of Qin.\"\n\nHearing that rebels from east of the Pass had arrived, the King of Qin went out to surrender. His palaces were set ablaze, and in terror, she fled into the mountains. Starving and with nothing to eat, she nearly died of hunger when an old man taught her to consume pine needles and pine nuts. At first, they tasted bitter, but gradually she grew accustomed to them, and thus she neither hungered nor thirsted, felt no cold in winter nor heat in summer. Calculating the years, this woman must have been a palace woman of Qin King Ziying, living until the reign of Emperor Cheng—over three hundred years. When brought back and fed grains, she first retched at the smell, vomiting for days before recovering. After about two years, her body hair fell away, and she grew old and died. Had she not been captured by men, she would surely have become an immortal.\n\nThe Wen family of Nanyang recounted that during the great chaos at the end of the Han, their ancestor fled into the mountains, starving and near death. Someone taught him to eat *zhu* (atractylodes), and thereafter he never knew hunger. After several decades, he returned to his hometown, his complexion youthful and his strength greater than before. He claimed that in the mountains, his body felt light, as if he could leap and bound over heights and perils, walking on ice and snow without feeling cold. He often saw a high cliff where several people sat—some playing board games, others reading. Leaning forward to observe, the Wen ancestor overheard them ask, \"Has this one reached the upper ranks yet?\" One replied, \"Not yet.\"\n\n*Zhu* is also called *shanji* (mountain thistle) or *shanjing* (mountain essence). The *Divine Elixir Classic* states: \"To attain longevity, one must constantly consume mountain essence.\" Formerly, the Eight Immortals each consumed a single substance to achieve earthly immortality, living for several hundred years before combining the divine elixir and golden liquor to ascend to the Great Clarity. If one were to combine and consume all eight substances, their power would not be realized, for the properties of these medicines counteract and restrain one another.\n\nHan Zhong consumed calamus for thirteen years, his body growing hair, and he could recite ten thousand words after reading them once. He never felt cold in winter. The calamus must grow on stone, be at least an inch long with nine or more nodes, and have purple flowers—this is especially effective. Zhao Tuo’s son consumed cinnamon for twenty years, and hair grew on the soles of his feet; he could walk five hundred *li* in a day and lift a thousand *jin*. Yi Menzi consumed schisandra for sixteen years, his complexion like jade, and he could enter water without getting wet or fire without being scorched. Chu Wenzi consumed rehmannia for eight years and could see at night as if by light, his hands strong enough to draw a crossbow. Lin Ziming consumed *zhu* for eleven years, and his ears grew five inches long; his body became light as flight, able to leap over ravines of twenty *zhang* or more. Du Ziwei consumed asparagus for eighty years, kept eighty concubines, and fathered one hundred thirty children; he could walk three hundred *li* in a day. Ren Ziji consumed poria for eighteen years, and immortals and jade maidens came to follow him. He could conceal and reveal himself at will, no longer ate grains, and his scars vanished, his face and body glowing like jade. Lingyang Zizhong consumed *yuanzhi* (polygala) for twenty years and fathered thirty-seven children; he never forgot what he read, whether sitting or standing.\n\nThe *Immortals’ Classic* states: \"Though one may consume the leaves of herbs and trees and live for several hundred years, if they neglect the divine elixir, they will ultimately fail to become immortals.\" From this, it is clear that herbs and plants merely extend life—they are not medicines of eternal life. Until one can refine the elixir, one may consume them to sustain oneself.\n\nSomeone asked whether there is a proper order for consuming medicinal substances. Master Baopu replied: \"According to the *Regimen for Consuming Medicines* by Master Zhonghuang: Take medicines for treating illness before meals, and those for nourishing life after meals. As for the golden elixir and great medicine, there is no need to discuss propriety.\"\n\nA single word on the palace:\n*Gengzi, Gengwu, Xinhai, Xinwei, Bingchen, Bingxu, Dinghai, Dingsi, Wuyin, Wushen, Jimao, Jiyou.*\n\nThree-word *zheng*:\n*Jiachen, Jiaxu; Yihai, Yisi; Bingyin, Bingshen; Dingyou, Dingmao; Wuwu, Wuzi; Jiwei, Jichou.*\n\nFive-word *yu*:\n*Jiayin, Jiashen; Yimao, Yiyou; Bingzi, Bingwu; Dingwei, Dingchou; Renchen, Renxu; Guisi, Guihai.*\n\nSeven-word *shang*:\n*Jiazi, Jiawu; Yichou, Yiwei; Gengchen, Gengxu; Xinhai, Xinsi; Renshen, Renyin; Guimao, Guiyou.*\n\nNine-word *jue*:\n*Wuchen, Wuxu; Jihai, Jisi; Gengyin, Gengshen; Xinmao, Xinyou; Renzu, Renzi; Guichou, Guiwei.*\n\nYu’s Stepping Method:\nStep forward, left foot crosses over;\nRight foot passes left, left foot joins right.\nNext, step forward, right foot crosses over;\nRight foot joins left, then step forward, right foot.\nRight foot passes left, left foot joins right;\nRight foot joins left.\nThus, three steps complete—\nTwenty-one *chi* and nine footprints in all.\n\nMinor divine formulas are to be consumed after meals.\nI consulted Master Zheng on this matter.\nMaster Zheng said: \"This is easily understood.\nWhen using medicine to attack illness, it is proper to take it before eating,\nfor the interior is empty, allowing the medicine’s power and momentum to act with ease.\nIf taken after eating, the medicine will merely attack the grain and its force will be exhausted.\nIf one takes medicine before eating to nourish life,\nthe medicine’s power will not yet have acted when it is driven downward by the grain,\nunable to remain and thus of no benefit.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"When people take medicine to nourish life,\nare there indeed proper correspondences?\"\nMaster Baopu replied: \"According to the *Jade Screen Record* and the *Kaiming Sutra*,\none may know the location of a person’s life in a given year through the five tones and six correspondences.\n*Zi* and *wu* belong to *geng*;\n*mao* and *you* belong to *ji*;\n*yin* and *shen* belong to *wu*;\n*chou* and *wei* belong to *xin*;\n*chen* and *xu* belong to *bing*;\n*si* and *hai* belong to *ding*.\nOne-word matches belong to *gong* and earth;\nthree-word matches belong to *zheng* and fire;\nfive-word matches belong to *yu* and water.\"\n\nSeven-word matches belong to *shang* and metal;\nnine-word matches belong to *jiao* and wood.\nIf one’s life corresponds to earth, one should not take green-colored medicines;\nif to metal, one should not take red-colored medicines;\nif to wood, one should not take white-colored medicines;\nif to water, one should not take yellow-colored medicines;\nif to fire, one should not take black-colored medicines—\nthis follows the principle of the Five Phases, wherein wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, and metal overcomes wood.\n\nRefine three *jin* of cinnabar and six *jin* of white honey, blend them, dry in the sun, and simmer until pliable enough to form pills. Take ten pills the size of sesame seeds at dawn. Within a year, white hair will turn black again, fallen teeth will regrow, and the body will become lustrous. With prolonged use, an old man will revert to youth, and with constant use, one will attain immortality without dying.\n\nFor the minor elixir of yellow gold: smelt the gold in clear wine, removing and reinserting it two hundred times until it boils. Knead it between the fingers until it becomes like clay; if it does not boil or fails to emerge between the fingers as clay, return it to the wine and smelt it repeatedly without count. When complete, take a pill the size of a bullet. Alternatively, form one pill into smaller ones and take them for thirty days—then cold and heat will no longer afflict you, and divine beings and jade maidens will descend. Silver may also be ingested using the same method as gold. Taking these two substances allows one to dwell in famous mountains or stone chambers; after a year, one will become weightless and ascend. Those who take them in the mortal world are called earthbound immortals—do not recklessly transmit this.\n\nFor the dual elixirs of smelted yellow gold: the *Pig-Borne Leather* method. Take three *jin* of lard, one *dou* of pure bitter wine, and five *liang* of yellow gold. Place the gold in a vessel and simmer it over an earthen stove, dipping the gold into the lard one hundred times in and out. Bitter wine may also be consumed: one *jin* grants a lifespan encompassing heaven and earth; half a *jin* grants two thousand years; five *liang* grant one thousand two hundred years. Take as much as desired, but prepare it on a day when the celestial stems and earthly branches are in harmony. The divine efficacy is assured—do not transmit this to others, for if you do, the medicine will fail to form and lose its potency.\n\nTo expel the Three Worms, one should take cinnabar. The method for ingesting cinnabar: grind one *jin* of cinnabar, mix it with three *sheng* of pure bitter wine and two *sheng* of pure lacquer (one version adds two *sheng* of honey). Combine the three substances thoroughly, then simmer over a fire until pliable enough to form pills. Take three pills the size of sesame seeds, twice daily. After forty days, the hundred diseases of the abdomen will be cured, and the Three Worms expelled. After a hundred days, the muscles and bones will become firm and strong. After a thousand days, the Director of Destinies will erase your name from the register of the dead, and you will endure as long as heaven and earth, gaze as far as the sun and moon. Your form will transform, your countenance will change, and you will become unfathomable. At midday, you will cast no shadow, for you will possess a radiance of your own.\n\n*Baopuzi, Inner Chapters, Scroll Two*\n*(Subsection: Masters, Daoist Works, Baopuzi Inner and Outer Chapters)*\n\n*The Imperial Four Treasuries Edition*\n*Baopuzi, Inner Chapters, Scroll Three*\n*By Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty*\n\n**Disputation and Inquiry, Chapter Twelve**\n\nSomeone asked: If immortality must be attainable, then the sages would have already cultivated it. Yet neither the Duke of Zhou nor Confucius pursued it—this proves that no such Way exists.\n\nBaopuzi replied: The sage need not be an immortal, nor must the immortal be a sage. The sage receives his mandate when the Dao of long life is not at hand; his sole desire is to eliminate cruelty, expel bandits, level dangers, pacify violence, establish rites, compose music, enact laws, transmit teachings, reform perverse customs, correct degenerate mores, rescue imperiled rulers, and sustain failing states. He carves the *Odes* and *Documents*, compiles the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing*, authors classics and proclamations, harmonizes *Ya* and *Song*, instructs the young, and responds to summons from the feudal lords. Like smoke unfurling without pause, his mat never warms—his affairs press upon him, his tasks exhaust the years without end. How then could he close his ears, cover his eyes, turn his gaze inward, reverse his hearing, practice breath regulation, engage in Daoist gymnastics, maintain prolonged purity, enter water to pan for gold, ascend mountains to gather herbs, count his breaths, contemplate the spirits, abstain from grains, or purify his intestines?\n\nAs for immortals, they require only unwavering resolve, perfect faith, and unrelenting diligence. One who can embrace tranquility and stillness may attain it—no extraordinary talent is needed. Those lofty transcendents who descend into the world become but heavy burdens to Daoist practitioners.\n\nTo obtain and ingest the Great Elixir, to master the essentials of guarding the One and nurturing the spirit, is to achieve long life and enduring vision. How could this compare to the boundless endeavors of the sages as commonly understood?\n\nMoreover, the so-called \"sages\" of the world are sages of governing the age, not sages of attaining the Dao. The sages of attaining the Dao are Huang-Lao; the sages of governing the age are the Duke of Zhou and Confucius. The Yellow Emperor first governed the world, then ascended as an immortal—this was merely a rare case of one possessing both talents.\n\nOf the ancient emperors and kings who carved inscriptions on Mount Tai, seventy-two can be verified through reading, while the rest have eroded beyond count. Yet only the Yellow Emperor’s ascent to immortality is recorded—its authenticity is thus clearly established.\n\nThe world deems those who excel in what others cannot as \"sages.\" Thus, one unmatched in *weiqi* is called a \"chess sage\"—hence Yan Ziqing and Ma Suiming are still known today as chess sages. One peerless in clerical script is called a \"calligraphy sage\"—hence Wei Xie and Zhang Mo are still known today as calligraphy sages. One exceptionally skilled in carving is called a \"wood sage\"—hence Zhang Wei and Ma Zhong are still known today as wood sages.\n\nTherefore, Mencius called Boyi the sage of purity and Liuxia Hui the sage of harmony.\n\nYi Yin is the sage of governance. Let me expound and argue that sagacity is not confined to a single endeavor. Ban Di was the sage of machinery, Fu Bian and Bian Que the sages of healing illness, Zi Wei and Gan Jun the sages of astrological divination, Shi Su and Xin Liao the sages of milfoil and turtle-shell divination, Xia Yu and Du Hui the sages of physical strength, Jing Ke and Nie Zheng the sages of courage, Fei Lian and Kua Fu the sages of swiftness, Zi Ye and Yanzhou the sages of musical discernment, Sun Wu, Wu Qi, Han Xin, and Bai Qi the sages of military strategy. Sagacity is the supreme designation for human affairs—it is not limited to literature alone.\n\nZhuang Zhou said: \"Bandits possess five aspects of the sage’s Way. To conjecture and know what others conceal is *ming*; to enter first without hesitation is *courage*; to withdraw last without fear is *righteousness*; to discern what is fitting is *wisdom*; to distribute spoils equally is *benevolence*. Without these, none could become the greatest bandit under heaven.\"\n\nSome may say: \"The sage’s Way cannot be divided into branches or scattered into leaves; it must be grasped in its entirety to be called sagacity.\" I reply: Among Confucius’ disciples, seventy-two attained mastery, each embodying a single facet of the sage—thus sagacity admits of division. It is also said: \"Yan Yuan possessed the whole but in miniature\"—thus sagacity admits of degrees. The *Yi* states: \"There are four aspects of the sage’s Way: in speech, one esteems its eloquence; in action, one esteems its adaptability; in crafting implements, one esteems their symbolic resonance; in divination, one esteems its omens.\" This is clear proof that the sage’s Way may be divided. Why, then, should those who excel in the Dao and attain immortality alone be denied the title of \"sage of the Dao\"? If there were no sages of the Dao, could Zhou and Kong be called sages of governance? Since sagacity is not singular, why demand that one person embody all its forms?\n\nThe immortal scriptures hold that those who attain transcendence are all born under the influence of the qi of immortality, naturally endowed with it. Even in the womb, they already harbor a predisposition toward the Dao. Once they gain consciousness, their hearts incline toward its practice, and they must encounter an enlightened master to receive its methods—otherwise, they will neither believe nor seek, and even if they seek, they will not obtain.\n\nThe *Jade Key Record* states that the origins of fate and the variations in human fortune—whether long or short—are determined at the moment of conception, when one receives the essence of the celestial lodges. Those aligned with the lodge of sagacity become sages; with the lodge of worthiness, worthies; with the lodge of literature, scholars; with the lodge of martiality, warriors; with the lodge of nobility, the noble; with the lodge of wealth, the wealthy; with the lodge of lowliness, the base; with the lodge of poverty, the poor; with the lodge of longevity, the long-lived; with the lodge of immortality, immortals. There are also lodges of divine immortals and sages, lodges of world-governing sages, lodges combining both, lodges of nobility without wealth, of wealth without nobility, of combined wealth and nobility, of wealth followed by poverty, of nobility followed by lowliness, of combined poverty and lowliness, of wealth and nobility unfulfilled, of loyalty and filial piety, of malevolence and wickedness—such variations cannot be exhaustively listed. The broad distinctions are as follows: a person’s life is fundamentally predestined, as Zhang Chezi’s teachings affirm.\n\nIf one is not fated to receive the mandate of immortality, one will not harbor a heart inclined toward transcendence. No one seeks what their heart does not desire, nor obtains what they do not seek. From antiquity to the present, there have been those of towering talent and profound understanding who disbelieved in immortals, and those of ordinary ability who studied and attained transcendence. Some, though discerning in many matters, may be blind to immortality; others, though less perceptive, may grasp its principles—is this not the work of heavenly mandate?\n\nDaoist lineages treasure and guard their transcendent arts, selecting disciples with utmost care and testing them over long years before imparting their essential secrets. How much less would they reveal these to the world at large, who neither believe nor seek? Why compel them to speak? Unable to transform others into believers, they would only invite ridicule and slander. Thus, those who attain the Dao differ from worldly people in their paths, their dwellings, their words, and their conduct. They keep a thousand *li* distant, fearing even that is insufficient to escape the assaults of gossip; they sever all traces, fearing even that is insufficient to avoid the shame of slander. Neither rank nor wealth can sway them—why would they ever proclaim to vulgar scholars, \"I possess the arts of immortality\"? This is why Zhou and Kong had no means to know the Way of transcendence.\n\nMoreover, Zhou and Kong were merely men of great talent and profound learning. Even in minor skills, they were often unversed. Had they been made to juggle balls, wield swords, leap over blades, toss daggers, walk tightropes, scale poles, pluck plates, climb tables, or cling to sheer cliffs a myriad *ren* high; to swim the unfathomable depths of Lüliang; to lift a thousand *jun* with their hands or tread upon whirlwinds; to grapple with caged tigers and leopards or catch flying arrows—even ordinary people could perform such feats, yet Zhou and Kong could not. How much less could they surpass these?\n\nWhat others contemplate—the orientation of fleas and lice, the colors behind walls, the grasses beneath trees, the texts in chests, the treasures buried in the earth, the birds and beasts in dense forests and deep marshes, the fish and turtles in vast abysses and torrential pools—had Zhou and Kong been made to discern their hues, distinguish their names, enumerate their quantities, and verify their presence or absence, they might not have known them all. How much less could they comprehend what lies beyond?\n\nSages grow hungry without food, thirsty without drink; they feel heat when scorched, cold when chilled, pain when struck, and injury when cut. With time, they age; with harm, they sicken; with the severing of *qi*, they die. In these ways, they differ little from ordinary people—their distinctions are few. What sets them apart lies only in their superior talent, far-reaching thought, eloquence, refined writing, complete virtue, pure conduct, rigorous instruction, and vast learning. How could they excel in every endeavor? Having already composed the *Dian* and *Mo* to pacify the realm and govern the people, why demand that they also master the Dao of transcendence and attain deathless longevity? To impose such expectations on sages is excessive.\n\nI have heard that profound words offend the ears of the vulgar, and truthful speech contradicts the crowd. Those who read this text will surely accuse me of slandering the sages. How could I? I merely exhaust the principles of things. When principles are exhausted and affairs fully explored, it may seem like disparagement of Zhou and Kong. Yet the world claims that sages descend from heaven as divine beings, omniscient and omnipotent—this is an extreme exaggeration.\n\nThose who revere the sages’ names dare not examine their deeds, claiming that what sages cannot do, no one else can, and what sages do not know, no one else knows. Is this not laughable? Let us now compare their actual deeds to awaken understanding.\n\nThe birds of Mount Wan sang their songs of life and death, yet Confucius did not know them—could one then say that Yan Hui could only partially comprehend them? When Confucius heard the weeping of a woman on Mount Tai and asked her cause, he learned that a tiger had devoured three of her kin, yet he did not understand why she had not moved away. Only upon questioning did he realize. When he saw hunters catching fledglings, he did not grasp their intent until asked. When he wished to bury his mother but did not know his father’s grave, he required guidance. Once the grave was set, its collapse again escaped his notice, and only after his disciples informed him did he weep in sorrow. When he suspected Yan Yuan of stealing food, he feigned a desire to sacrifice to his ancestors to test him, casting dust to expose the deception. When a stable burned, he did not know whether men or horses were harmed. Later, hearing that Yan Yuan had died, he declared it so. Though he wandered through seventy states, he could not foresee that none would employ him. Restless and hurried, his mat never warmed, yet he did not know the people of Kuang would surround him until he took that road. He asked Laozi about ancient rites but found some beyond his understanding. He inquired of Tanzi about the offices of birds but could not recognize them all. Traveling without knowing the ford, he sent others to ask, unaware that those he questioned would mock him and refuse to show the way—had he known, would he not have refrained from asking? When he alighted from his carriage to chase a man singing of the phoenix, he did not realize the man would not stay. Meeting Nanzi, he did not foresee it would bring no benefit. Such instances are too numerous to list, yet why should it be strange that he did not know the methods of transcendence?\n\nCommon scholars claim that what sages cannot do, no one else can. Yet Dan of the Marsh lived in water, Liang Mu transformed through fire, Zibo Zhan endured extreme cold, Zuo Ci escaped death through martial arts, Gan Shi fasted for years, Fan Ye remained unharmed when struck, the Turtle Decree revived the dead, Shao Qian grasped a hundred demons, Chang Fang shrank the earth’s veins, Zhong Fu took the form of a morning duck, and Zhang Kai summoned clouds and mist with his breath. Never have we heard that Zhou or Kong could perform such feats.\n\nSome say, \"Zhou and Kong could have done these things but chose not to.\" I reply: If one does not seek evidence in clear records but instead points to empty words, I could just as well claim that Zhou and Kong could spread their wings and soar to the eight directions, summon clouds and rain, or move mountains and shift wells—but they chose not to. Without written records as proof, what limits are there?\n\nIf this is the case, I could also say that Zhou and Kong both ascended as immortals, but they concealed this method lest the world know that deathlessness is attainable. If all abandoned their duties to pursue the Dao—forsaking official posts, risking peril, and venturing into the depths—then families would have no descendants, states no ministers or officials, loyalty and filial piety would vanish, and the great order would collapse. Thus, Zhou and Kong practiced in secret, revealing only the appearance of death while inwardly mastering the arts of transcendence. If so, how could you refute me? It may well be true.\n\nThe *Lingbao Sutra* contains the *Zhengji*, *Pingheng*, and *Feixian Shouzhi*—three scrolls of immortal arts. When the King of Wu quarried stone to build his palace, he found within the rock a book of purple script on golden tablets. Unable to read it, he sent an envoy to ask Confucius, who deceived him, saying, \"The King of Wu, in leisure, received a book delivered by a red sparrow to his hall. Unsure of its meaning, he seeks your counsel.\" Upon seeing it, Confucius declared, \"This is the *Lingbao* method, the Way of long life. Yu of Xia practiced it, dwelling in the watery realm, his years equaling heaven and earth, his court held in the Purple Palace. When Yu was about to transcend, he sealed it in a stone casket on a sacred mountain, and now the red sparrow has brought it—surely it is a gift from heaven.\" By this reasoning, Yu of Xia did not die, and Confucius knew of it. How can we be certain he did not secretly cultivate this Way?\n\nEven if sages did not practice such arts, one cannot say they lacked their effects. People’s likes and dislikes vary as widely as their faces—is this not true? What aligns with their inclinations, though small, they will pursue; what does not resonate with their spirit, though great, they will not learn. Some love bitterness and despise sweetness, while others crave profit and abandon righteousness—such cases are countless.\n\nThe greatest treasure of sages is rank; what draws people together is wealth. Riches and nobility are what all desire, yet in ancient times, some declined the abdication of imperial power, spurned the riches of the four seas, scorned the offices of the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers, and rejected jade and silk, choosing instead the lofty purity of mountains and forests, content with the humble life of fishing. Such examples are too many to count.\n\nIt is said that men and women, food and drink, are humanity’s greatest desires. Thus, some cannot be dissuaded from their love of beauty, nor can they forget their cravings for fine flavors. Yet in the past, there were those who abandoned grain, forsook delicacies, took no wives or concubines, wandered alone in enlightenment, spoke words of insight, delighted in their own reflection, rinsed their mouths with flowing water, and savored plain tastes—such cases are too numerous to recall.\n\nHuman nature cherishes rosy cheeks and graceful forms, yet the Yellow Emperor delighted in the homely Momu, and the Marquis of Chen loved the repulsive Dunqia. No nose dislikes fragrance, so why are liuhuang, yujin, orchids, musk, suhe, xuandan, sujiao, jiangli, jieche, spring orchids, and autumn orchids prized like jade and jasper? Yet the women of the sea follow men who reek of rancid odors, never tiring of them. No mouth dislikes sweetness, yet King Wen of Zhou preferred the unpalatable *kuai* to the rich flavors of the grand sacrifice. No ear dislikes music, yet Emperor Ming of Wei favored the sound of hammer and chisel over the harmony of strings and bamboo. Each person has their own inclinations—how can one demand that this be the same as that?\n\nZhou and Kong themselves did not believe in the Dao of transcendence. The sun and moon do not illuminate all things; sages do not know all things. To claim that what sages do not do, the world cannot do, is like blaming the three luminaries for not illuminating the inside of an overturned basin.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: On the Utmost**\n\nSomeone asked: \"Were the immortals of old all those who attained transcendence through study, or were they specially endowed with exceptional qi?\"\n\nThe Master Who Embraces Simplicity replied: \"What kind of question is this? None of them did not carry their satchels to follow teachers, accumulating merit through diligent effort. They endured frost and braved peril, combed by wind and washed by rain, personally sweeping and toiling. Only after proving their sincerity and conduct were they tested with hardship and adversity. Only those whose nature was steadfast and true, whose hearts held no resentment or doubt, were permitted to ascend the hall and enter the inner chamber. Some grew weary and halted midway; some became resentful and retreated; some were lured by glory and profit, returning to the ways of the common world; some were swayed by heterodox teachings, losing their resolve for detachment. Some expected success by evening after practicing in the morning; some sat in cultivation yet stood hoping for results. As for those who beheld wealth and beauty without their hearts wavering, or heard worldly words without their resolve faltering—among ten thousand, one such person is rare.\"\n\nThus, those who strive are as numerous as ox hairs, while those who attain are as rare as unicorn horns. The archer who draws the bow exerts effort in loosing the arrow; the traveler who crosses the great river preserves his life only upon reaching the far shore. A well that does not reach the spring is as good as undug; a single step not taken is as good as never having set forth. The toils of the long road cannot be traversed in a single day’s watch, nor can the heights of the clouds be scaled by one basket of earth. Yet those who climb perilous peaks falter when near the summit, their strength failing; those who walk the Way fall ill when on the verge of completion, their resolve unfulfilled. A thousand granaries of grain are not the yield of one planting; a tree of a thousand feet does not grow in ten days. The unfathomable abyss begins with a trickle; the wealth of Tao Zhu was amassed over hundreds and thousands. Thus, when others retreat, one advances—this is how Yin Xi attained the utmost Dao. Reverent to the end as at the beginning—this is how Xian Men rode the clouds and dragons. If my resolve is truly steadfast, what matter who they are?\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity said: The common folk, unable to sustain life, instead devote themselves to destroying it. Finite things cannot supply infinite depletion; the flow of rivers cannot fill a bottomless vessel. Most people, earning little yet spending much, still cannot make ends meet—how much less so for those with no income at all yet endless expenditures? None, young or old, are free from illness; it is only a matter of severity. Each receives qi in varying measure: those with much exhaust it slowly, while those with little deplete it swiftly. Those who know the Way replenish and restore themselves, first returning to their original state before seeking further benefits. If one were to consume elixirs for ten days, flesh would soar and bones ascend; if one practiced Daoist arts with each new moon, wings would sprout and feathers align—then the world would have no one who disbelieved in the Way.\n\nThe trouble lies in this: the meager benefits of a single ladle are not yet firm, yet the costs of bushels and tons are already guarded against; the roots’ hold is not yet deep, yet the poison of frost and snow assails them. Not recognizing that the fault lies within, one instead claims the Way is of no benefit—thus discarding pills and powders, abandoning breathing exercises. Therefore, it is not attaining long life that is difficult, but hearing the Way; not hearing the Way that is difficult, but practicing it; not practicing it that is difficult, but persisting to the end. A skilled craftsman can provide another with compass and square, but cannot ensure their mastery; a wise teacher can impart medical texts, but cannot guarantee their application. Cultivation is like sowing grain; completion is like harvesting it. Though the field be fertile and the water abundant, if one misses the season, neglects plowing and weeding, the crops will wither in the fields, unharvested and uncut. Though the acres be vast, there will be no yield.\n\nOrdinary people not only fail to recognize benefit as benefit, but also fail to recognize harm as harm. Harm is easy to know and swift; benefit is difficult to know and slow. If one does not grasp what is easy, how can one comprehend what is difficult? Harm is like the consumption of lamp oil—unseen, yet suddenly exhausted; benefit is like the growth of seedlings—unnoticed, yet suddenly lush. Therefore, in cultivating the body and nurturing nature, one must attend carefully to the smallest details. One cannot dismiss minor benefits as insignificant and neglect them, nor overlook minor harms as harmless and fail to guard against them. All great things arise from the accumulation of small things; a hundred million begins with one. If one cherishes the beginning and completes the end with diligence, then one has guarded the Way.\n\nSomeone asked: In ancient times, were there those who attained long life without any practice, merely by chance? The Master Embracing Simplicity replied: There were not. Some followed renowned teachers, accumulating merit and enduring hardship, and were thus granted completed elixirs; others received secret formulas and practiced them in seclusion, their deeds untouched by the world, their words unburdened by俗. Records preserve only their names, not the means by which they attained immortality—thus, such accounts are incomplete.\n\nOf old, the Yellow Emperor, born speaking, commanded a hundred spirits—one might call him naturally endowed by Heaven. Yet even he could not attain the Way by sitting idly. Thus, he ascended Wangwu Mountain to receive the cinnabar scriptures, journeyed to Dinghu to ascend on a flying pearl, climbed Kongtong to consult Guangcheng, and served Da Kui at Juci. He traveled to Mount Tai to honor Zhonghuang, entered Jingu to consult Hua Zi, discussed the cultivation of the Way with the two Xuan Su maidens, sought the precision of astronomy from Shan Ji and Li Mu, studied divination from Feng Hou, learned pulse diagnosis from Lei Qi, mastered warfare from the Five Tones’ defense, exposed hidden evils through the *Baize* records, surveyed geography through the *Qingniao* writings, and mended wounds with the arts of metallurgy. Thus, he encompassed all secrets, exhausted the Way, and fulfilled the truth, ascending on a dragon to the highest reaches, peerless with Heaven and Earth.\n\nYet the *Scriptures of Divine Immortals* all state that the Yellow Emperor and Laozi served the Great One, the Primordial Lord, to receive essential instructions. How much less could those inferior to these two lords attain immortality and transcend the world without such guidance? I have never heard of it.\n\nSomeone asked: If the Yellow Emperor truly attained immortality, why is there a tomb at Mount Qiao? The Master Embracing Simplicity replied: According to the *Classic of Mount Jing* and the *Record of the Dragon’s Return*, after the Yellow Emperor consumed the divine elixir, a dragon came to welcome him. His ministers, overwhelmed with longing, could not bear to part. Some took his mat and staff to establish a temple and make offerings; others took his robes and crown to bury and guard. The *Biographies of Divine Immortals* states that the Yellow Emperor chose his day of departure seventy days in advance. Seventy days later, he returned and was buried at Mount Qiao. Suddenly, the mountain collapsed, the tomb was empty, and only his sword and sandals remained. Though these accounts differ, they all affirm his attainment of immortality.\n\nThose who speak of the Yellow Emperor’s immortality appear frequently in Daoist texts and the sayings of the Hundred Schools, yet the Confucians, unwilling to entertain strange or extraordinary paths, focus solely on ritual and teaching. The affairs of divine immortals cannot instruct the common folk, so they claim his death to restrain the people’s hearts. Zhu Ba and Luan Ba rendered great service to the people, who built temples and made offerings to them in life. In ancient times, when men of great virtue passed away, their ministers carved their achievements on enduring monuments. Even today, when officials and people long for departed rulers and elders, they erect steles to praise their virtue—this is akin to the Yellow Emperor having temples and tombs. How does this prove he must have died?\n\nSomeone asked: Peng Zu lived eight hundred years, An Qi three thousand—these are lives surpassing others. If there truly is a Way of immortality, why did they not attain it? Is it not that their allotted lifespan and received qi had a fixed span, and they merely happened to live longer? In principle, it cannot be extended, so they could not escape decay and death.\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity said: ...\n\nGezhi Ziyang responded: According to the *Pengzu Jing*, he served under Emperor Ku, assisted Yao, passed through the Xia dynasty, and became a grandee in Yin. The Yin king sent women to learn the arts of the bedchamber from him, and when they proved effective, sought to kill Pengzu to suppress his Way. Pengzu sensed this and fled, departing at the age of seven or eight hundred—this was not death. The *Huangshi Gong Ji* records that more than seventy years after Pengzu’s departure, his disciples saw him west of the Flowing Sands—clearly, he did not die. Moreover, Pengzu’s disciples—Qingyi Wugong, Heixue Gong, Xiumei Gong, Baitu Gong, Zililou Gong, Taizu Jun, and Gaoqiuzi Bukenlai—seven or eight in all, each lived for several hundred years in Yin before ascending as immortals. How could Pengzu himself have died? Furthermore, Liu Xiang’s *Liexian Zhuan* also states that Pengzu was an immortal.\n\nAs for Master Anqi, he sold medicines by the sea in Langye. Transmitted accounts say he had already lived a thousand years by the time Qin Shihuang summoned him for conversation, which lasted three days and nights. His words were lofty, his defenses profound, his learning vast and well-evidenced. Shihuang, astonished, bestowed upon him gold and jade worth tens of millions. Anqi accepted them, placing them at Fuxiang Pavilion, and left a pair of red jade shoes as repayment, along with a letter saying: “Seek me again on Penglai Mountain after several thousand years.” Thus, he was already a thousand years old when he met Shihuang—clearly, he did not die. Moreover, Shihuang was harsh and cruel, a man who ruled the world and would not have believed in immortals, nor would he have tolerated answers that displeased him. Yet when he questioned Anqi about the matter of longevity, Anqi’s responses were fitting, and Shihuang, awakening to the truth, came to believe that immortality must exist in the world. He bestowed generous gifts and earnestly desired to learn the art of deathlessness, but lacked an enlightened teacher. Deceived by the likes of Lu Ao and Xu Fu, he failed to attain it. Had Anqi’s words lacked substance, within three days and nights they would have been exhausted, and Shihuang would surely have boiled, roasted, or slaughtered him, sparing him no calamity of the cauldron. How then could he have received such lavish gifts?\n\nSomeone asked: If there are those who consume medicinal substances, practice qi circulation, and perform daoyin exercises, yet still cannot escape death, why is this?\n\nGezhi Ziyang answered: Those who do not obtain the golden elixir but only ingest herbal medicines or cultivate minor arts may prolong their years and delay death, but they cannot attain immortality. Some know only how to take herbs but not the essential techniques of rejuvenation—thus, they will never achieve long life. Others fail to understand how to wear spirit talismans, observe prohibitions, or guard the true unity within; they may only prevent illness, ward off wind and dampness, and avoid minor ailments. But if suddenly afflicted by malevolent ghosts, fierce demons, mountain spirits, water toxins, or other harms, they will die. Some do not know the methods for entering mountains, provoking mountain spirits to bring misfortune—demons test them, beasts injure them, ravine toxins entangle them, snakes and vipers sting them—leading to many deaths, each with its own cause. Others begin cultivation late in life, having already inflicted deep harm upon themselves, making recovery difficult. Even if they attempt to mend what is broken, the benefits are not yet consolidated when illness strikes again. How can such destructive practices lead to longevity?\n\nSome who take up the Way in old age attain immortality, while others who begin young fail—why is this? The former, though aged, received abundant qi at birth; with abundant qi, their injuries are shallow and easily healed, so they succeed. The latter, though young, received little qi at birth; with scant qi, their injuries run deep and are hard to heal, so they fail. Consider the hibiscus and willow: when cut and replanted, they revive whether upright or inverted, whether planted vertically or horizontally—no plant revives more easily. Yet if buried too shallowly or not long enough, if scraped or stripped, shaken or uprooted, even if nourished with rich soil and bathed in spring rains, they still wither and perish. Their roots are not firm, they cannot sprout new buds, their vital fluids fail to coalesce, and their life force cannot take form. The human body is easily harmed and difficult to nurture—far more so than these two plants. Yet the forces that assault it—scraping, stripping, shaking, uprooting—are even more severe. With little to sustain it and much to destroy it, death is only natural.\n\nThose who exhale the old and inhale the new rely on qi to grow, but when qi is greatly depleted, growth becomes difficult. Those who consume medicines rely on blood to replenish it, but when blood is nearly exhausted, replenishment is hard. Running and panting, coughing and choking, laboring the body and exhausting the spirit—these are signs of qi depletion. A dull complexion, withered skin, parched lips, pale veins, shriveled pores—these are signs of blood exhaustion. When these two signs decline externally, the spiritual root withers within. In such cases, even superior medicines cannot save them.\n\nThose who cultivate the Way yet fail, who manage their lives yet die—though they possess qi and blood, the root of what makes them qi and blood has already perished, leaving only its branches and streams. Like embers cast into water, the fire is extinguished, yet smoke does not immediately vanish; like a severed tree, its leaves may yet live. These are not without smoke or leaves, but what makes them smoke or leaves has already perished.\n\nPeople assume illness begins when symptoms appear, and death when breath ceases. They fear only wind, cold, heat, and dampness, unaware that these cannot harm the robust. Only those with weak bodies and scant qi cannot endure them and thus succumb. How to compare this? Suppose several people of the same age and similar health venture into the desert, braving a frigid night. Snow falls upon them, ice forms beneath, cold winds lash their limbs, and the night is filled with coughs and frozen spittle. Among them, some may fall ill from the cold, but not all—this is not because the cold favors some, but because some bodies cannot endure it. Likewise, when all eat the same food, some may fall ill from it—not because the food is inherently toxic, but because their constitutions differ. When drinking from the same vessel, some may become drunk while others remain sober—not because the wine’s potency varies, but because their tolerance differs. When exposed to scorching heat, some may die of heatstroke—not because the sun discriminates, but because their resilience differs.\n\nTaking the same medicine, some may alone grow drowsy, restless, and distressed—not because the drug’s potency harbors favor or spite. Thus, when a fierce wind rushes into the forest, the withered boughs are the first to snap; when a great wave crashes against the cliff, the rock embracing a fissure is the first to crumble; when wildfire sweeps the plain, the parched grasses are the first to burn; when a dragon bowl falls to the ground, the brittle ones alone shatter. From this we see that those without the bodily vessel of the Dao, already ailing in their fundament, are merely provoked by wind, cold, heat, or damp. If one can ensure that the upright qi does not decline and that form and spirit guard each other, nothing can harm them.\n\nGenerally, those who pursue the Dao fear beginning too late, not too early. Those who rely on their youthful vigor and robust strength overtax themselves, accumulating a hundred ailments until their lives hang by a thread, like morning dew. Even with potent medicine, merely consuming herbs and plants may restore them to the state of ordinary people, but cannot extend their allotted span. Thus the immortal classics say: “In nurturing life, not causing harm is the foundation”—this is the essential teaching. Shennong declared: “If the hundred diseases are not cured, how can one attain long life?” Truly so.\n\nSomeone asked: “Is what you call harm not found in excess and desire?” Baopuzi replied: “How could it be only that? Yet the essence of long life lies in the Way of Returning to Youth. The superior practitioner knows this and can thereby extend years and dispel illness; the next best does not harm himself. If one, though still young and strong, knows the Way of Returning to Youth, takes the Yin Elixir to replenish the brain, and gathers Jade Fluid from the long valleys, even without consuming medicinal substances, they will not fail to reach three hundred years—though they may not attain immortality. Those who do not grasp the method are like one who fills an ice cup with boiling water or wraps fire in a feather bundle. Moreover, straining to think beyond one’s capacity harms; forcing oneself to lift beyond one’s strength harms.”\n\nGrief and sorrow wear one down; excessive joy and delight harm as well. Relentless pursuit of desires injures; prolonged talking and laughter injure. Sleeping and resting at improper times injure; drawing bows and pulling crossbows injure. Deep intoxication and vomiting injure; eating one’s fill and lying down immediately injure. Leaping and running until breathless injure; exultant shouts and bitter weeping injure. Lack of union between Yin and Yang injures. When accumulated injuries reach their limit, early death follows—early death is not the Way.\n\nThus, the methods of nurturing life are these: do not spit far, do not walk swiftly, do not strain the ears, do not gaze intently for long, do not sit to the point of exhaustion, do not lie down until fatigued. Dress before the cold becomes extreme, remove clothing before the heat becomes unbearable. Do not eat only when ravenously hungry, and do not eat to excess; do not drink only when parched, and do not drink too much. For overeating leads to stagnation and accumulations, while overdrinking forms phlegm and obstructions. Avoid extreme exertion and extreme indolence; do not rise late, do not sweat profusely, do not sleep excessively. Do not gallop on horseback or race in carriages, do not strain the eyes gazing into the distance, do not consume too much raw or cold food. Do not drink wine in the wind, do not bathe too frequently, do not harbor grand ambitions or distant aspirations, do not pursue strange and elaborate contrivances. In winter, do not seek extreme cold; in summer, do not pursue excessive coolness. Do not sleep exposed beneath the stars, do not sleep with shoulders bared in the night. Extreme cold, extreme heat, great winds, and thick fog—all should be avoided.\n\nThe five flavors entering the mouth should not be taken in excess: too much sourness harms the spleen, too much bitterness harms the lungs, too much pungency harms the liver, too much saltiness harms the heart, and too much sweetness harms the kidneys—this is the natural principle of the Five Phases. What is called \"injury\" is not immediately apparent; it means that over time, one’s lifespan is diminished.\n\nTherefore, those skilled in nurturing life rise and retire according to the seasons’ early and late hours, maintain regularity in their daily activities with perfect harmony, regulate and strengthen sinews and bones through proper postures, ward off illness and repel evil with techniques of swallowing and exhaling, circulate and harmonize the constructive and defensive qi with methods of supplementation and drainage, and balance labor and rest with the essentials of giving and taking. They restrain anger to preserve Yin qi and suppress joy to nourish Yang qi. Only then do they first take herbal medicines to remedy deficiencies, and later ingest the Golden Elixir to secure boundless longevity. The principle of eternal life is fully contained herein.\n\nIf one resolves to follow their inclinations, considering themselves enlightened and accepting of fate, dismissing heterodox teachings, indulging emotions and exerting strength without cultivating longevity—when such a person hears these words, they pass by like the wind.\n\nThe lightning’s passage before one’s eyes cannot be described in full—yet some, though their bodies wither in dissipation and their qi expires amid silken pleasures, remain content. How then could one speak to them of the arts of nurturing life? Not only will they refuse to accept it; they will call it heresy. To expect their belief would be like offering a mirror to the blind or music to the deaf.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: Earnest Seeking**\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: The greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth is the generation of life, the cherishing of all things. Thus, the most guarded and revered secrets of the Daoist tradition are none other than the methods of attaining longevity. For this reason, blood-oath covenants are sworn before transmission, and the warnings of heavenly punishment are invoked. Even the former masters dared not lightly impart these teachings to others; only when a seeker’s devotion is most earnest should one carefully select the most sincere to instruct. How much less should one casually offer them to those who neither desire nor seek them, or who seek without wholeheartedness?\n\nThose who are not destined to attain immortality, even if they witness immortals thronging the world, will still insist that such beings are of a different kind, that they belong to another realm, or call them transformations of demons and sprites. Some may claim it was mere chance encounter. Who among them would acknowledge that immortality is the result of cultivation? If they do not believe, even if Red Pine or Wang Qiao were to speak to them directly, they would still point and call it heresy.\n\nYet even among those who recognize and believe, many falter in their inability to seek diligently for a true master. Those who comprehend the essentials and attain the genuine Dao are indeed rare, and cannot be found in haste. Still, those who know of it say only that such masters are few—not that they have vanished from the world. For those with the destiny for immortality, if they seek broadly and sincerely, they will inevitably encounter them. Yet while some seek and do not find, none have ever found without seeking.\n\nIn the world, there are countless deceivers who usurp the title of Daoist to swindle money. Yet even these will not admit to complete ignorance; they may feign some superficial understanding, falsely claim mastery, or adorn themselves with tricks to deceive. The gullible, unable to discern truth from falsehood, flock to them with questions, only to be misled. These frauds then restrict their followers, preventing them from seeking further, and declare, “The Dao is exhausted here.” How lamentable and infuriating that so many earnest seekers are thus led astray!\n\nOccasionally, one may encounter those who understand the refinement of the Five Clouds, the transmutation of the Eight Stones, the compounding of the Nine Elixirs, the alchemy of cinnabar and gold, the congealing of jade-like frost and snow in the divine crucible, or the gathering of lingzhi on Mount Song. Yet the many will slander them, saying, “Only Red Pine and Wang Qiao knew these methods. For modern men to claim such knowledge is sheer delusion.” The shallow-minded, failing to recognize the deceit in such words, abandon their far-reaching quests in despair. How sorrowful and sigh-worthy this is!\n\nTime flies like an arrow, swift as the wind; youth vanishes in an instant, and old age arrives with terrible speed. Nothing in the world compares to its haste. A lifespan of a hundred years is but thirty thousand days.\n\nThose who guard against weakness know nothing, while those who await decline and old age find all joy and pleasure abandoned. From the confusion of childhood to the senility of dotage, several decades pass in peril and distress, with sickness and sorrow ever at hand. Of the years one dwells in the world, barely half remain. Even if one lives a full century, the days of laughter and peace scarcely exceed fifty or sixty years—no more than six or seven thousand days of fleeting delight, sorrow, and senility. In the blink of an eye, they are gone. How much rarer still is one who attains a full hundred years? Reflecting earnestly, one can only pity those summer insects and morning mushrooms.\n\nTruly, this is the utmost sorrow of those who do not know the Dao. A common saying goes: \"Each day a person lives is a day lost, like driving cattle or sheep to the slaughter—every step brings death nearer.\" Though the comparison is crude, it holds truth. The enlightened do not grieve over death not because they do not seek life, but because they know no way to escape it. Thus, they say, \"Rejoice in Heaven and know fate, and so have no sorrow.\" It is not that they do not desire long life. The Duke of Zhou offered himself in place of King Wu, and Confucius dragged his staff in lament—even sages do not wish for swift death.\n\nYet common folk, seeing Zhuangzi’s metaphor of the great dream, rush to espouse the doctrine of equating life and death. These are cunning sophists, feigning detachment with words that defy restraint—precisely the kind Confucius sought to refute and punish. Observe those who speak thus: when struck by illness, they hastily seek acupuncture and moxibustion; when faced with mortal danger, they fear death intensely. Yet the prevailing custom dismisses truth, turning from the classics to the works of the Masters. Those who do not spout clever, paradoxical arguments are deemed rustic and unrefined, lacking the \"bone and marrow\" of Lao-Zhuang thought. Thus, the vulgar drift into baseless doctrines, unable to return to reason.\n\nLaozi made long life and enduring vision his pursuit, while Zhuangzi prized wagging his tail in the mud over being a sacrificial ox in embroidered robes, or starving while begging grain from the Marquis of He. From this, we know he could not truly equate life and death. Later scholars, failing to examine the truth, cling to a single phrase—is this not folly?\n\nMoreover, to descend into the Nine Springs, where the endless night begins, to become food for ants and worms, and finally merge with the dust—this thought sears the heart with dread. If one truly seeks life, how can one not abandon trivial matters and cultivate the wondrous arts? Those who do not believe may do as they please. But those who do believe yet fail to cast off worldly attachments, who cannot focus solely on nurturing life but dabble in cultivation only in the spare moments between worldly affairs—even if they attempt it, they often begin too late and rarely succeed.\n\nWhat most people covet is power, profit, and desire. Yet if one’s body is not whole, even high office, vast wealth, mountains of gold and jade, or countless beauties are not truly one’s own. Thus, the superior person first attends to the matter of long life. Once long life is secured, all desires can be fulfilled at will. If one has not yet ascended to the realm of the immortals, one may at least become an earthbound immortal, dwelling among men like Pengzu or Laozi, living for centuries without losing the joys of human existence. Then, one may gradually ascend—this, too, is a grand achievement. Yet one must find a worthy teacher; without sufficient devotion, success is impossible.\n\nIn former times, the Empress Dowager of Han studied the *Book of Documents* under Xiahou Sheng, rewarding him with a hundred catties of gold and countless treasures. Upon his death, she bestowed two million coins upon his family and mourned him for a hundred days. When Emperor Cheng was heir apparent, he studied the *Analects* under Zhang Yu. After ascending the throne, he enfeoffed Yu as Marquis Within the Pass, granted him a fief of a thousand households, and appointed him Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, bestowing a hundred catties of gold. Later, when Yu was promoted to Chancellor and advanced to the rank of Marquis of An, he begged retirement in his old age. The emperor granted him a carriage drawn by four horses and a hundred catties of gold, along with tens of thousands of coins. When Yu fell ill, the emperor personally visited and knelt at his bedside. When Emperor Zhang was heir apparent, he studied the *Classic of Filial Piety* under Huan Rong. After ascending the throne, he appointed Rong Grand Master over the Masses. The emperor visited Rong’s residence, allowing him to sit facing east with a table and staff, while officials and hundreds of Rong’s disciples attended. The emperor personally held the texts and lectured. He enfeoffed Rong as Marquis Within the Pass with a fief of five thousand households. When Rong fell ill, the emperor visited his home, dismounting at the alley entrance and hurrying forward with the scrolls in his arms, like a disciple. When Rong passed, the emperor donned mourning garb.\n\nNone of these men achieved merit through conquering cities, battling in the wilds, breaking enemy formations, or expanding the realm—through deeds of valor or exploits in distant lands. They merely transmitted the teachings of a single classic, expounding its phrases, yet were honored so grandly. These were but empty words about the dead. Even emperors, in their exalted position, humbled themselves to serve such teachers. Yet in the world today, those who wish to cultivate the Dao of long life refuse to humble themselves before a worthy master, trampling upon propriety in their haste to seek the essentials. How can they possibly succeed?\n\nScholars may bow in reverence and run errands in service—what benefit do such trifling acts bring to their teacher? Yet without them, their hearts remain unyielding. If their hearts remain unyielding, even when instructed, they will not apply themselves fully. If they do not apply themselves fully, how can they possibly obtain the secret essentials in their entirety? At best, they may be shown superficial techniques—how could these suffice to achieve the work of immortality?\n\nThere are also those whose fair complexion and pleasing appearance inspire trust, yet their devotion to the Dao is not rooted in the heart. Their spirits seek only to extract something. Outwardly, they feign deep reverence, but within days, their negligence becomes apparent. Should they encounter a discerning teacher, he may wish to observe their intentions closely. Testing them with prolonged delay and withholding instruction to gauge their resolve, such people will reveal their true nature—deception and falsity. Even if taught, they will not receive the full transmission, nor will they speak with sincerity. If their words are not sincere, teaching them is of no benefit.\n\nChen Anshi was but thirteen years old, a mere retainer in Guan Shuben’s household. Having first attained the immortal Dao, Shuben—though seventy years of age with a head of white hair—bowed morning and night to Anshi, saying: “The Dao is noble, and virtue is esteemed; he who first attains the Way is the teacher. I dare not grow weary in upholding the rites of a disciple.” Thus, Anshi revealed to him the essential methods, and Shuben, too, ascended as an immortal.\n\nMan receives his spirit first from Heaven and Earth, then his qi and blood from his parents. Yet without a enlightened teacher to instruct him in the Dao of transcending the world, he has no means to escape death. A chisel may leave embers in the stone, but the years of one’s life have already crumbled. By this reasoning, the grace of an enlightened teacher truly surpasses that of Heaven and Earth and outweighs that of parents. How can one not revere them? How can one not seek them?\n\nGe Hong said: The ancients were plain and valued deeds over words. Thus, those who governed did not esteem rhetorical flourish, and those who cultivated the Dao did not exalt eloquent discourse. As customs declined and shallowed, external adornments grew ever more elaborate. The barriers of formal learning piled high like mountains at the gates of the Confucians, while the inner scriptures were likewise scattered and neglected among the masters of esoteric arts. Beginners could not be immediately entrusted with essential teachings, and human nature, moreover, finds greater delight in abundance of beginnings and ends. Thus, later adepts of the Dao—such as Gan Ji, Rong Song, and Gui Bo—each composed works numbering in the thousands of chapters. Yet these were largely admonitions and exhortations, unwilling to reveal the great guiding principles and ultimate aims.\n\nThe true oral instructions for attaining the Real might be transmitted only by word of mouth or written on no more than a foot of silk, concealed within the folds of one’s collar. Without long and arduous training under a master, without enduring trials and tests, one could not obtain them. Even among the motley disciples, each was taught according to the depth of their devotion, the length of their suffering, the reach of their intelligence, and the capacity of their talents. Over a thousand years, only a few ever exhausted the secrets hidden in their master’s pillows or sleeves.\n\nSome were merely given prepared elixirs to share, sufficient to grant them immortality, yet the masters never transmitted the written methods. Thus, among the Daoist adepts of the world, not one in ten thousand knows the art of the Golden Elixir. Yet the shallow and narrow-minded assume that the methods of immortality must lie in voluminous texts or in the rituals of sacrifice and prostration. Long life and mastery of destiny do not come from offerings and prayers.\n\nIn the Qin and Han dynasties, great sacrifices were made to Taiyi, the Five Spirits, Chenbao, the Eight Immortals, and others, expending cattle, sheep, grain, silk, and coin by the millions—all to no avail. How much less can a common man, whose virtue is incomplete and whose body is untended, hope to extend his years by offering the three sacrificial animals, wine, and delicacies, beseeching the gods with prayers? Such delusion is profound.\n\nSome well-meaning enthusiasts, though earnest in their desire for the Dao, fail to diligently seek out renowned masters or compound rare elixirs. Instead, they spend their days reciting and expounding thousands of useless volumes, gaining nothing in old age. They conclude that immortality is but a myth, or they prostrate themselves in empty rooms, slaughter animals, burn incense, and pray for blessings—yet the sick are not healed, deaths follow one after another, fortunes are squandered, and not a single effect is achieved. They never repent, blaming only their own lack of devotion. Had they applied such diligence to seeking a master, had they spent such wealth on purchasing elixirs and secret arts, they would surely have attained transcendence and long life, escaping the world. What difference is there between this and plowing a stony field in old age, hoping for a thousand granaries’ harvest? Though their labor is great, they do not grasp the proper means. It is like setting out for Chu but taking the road to Yan: though the horse may be swift, it will not arrive, not because it does not run fast, but because it has lost the Way.\n\nSome are credulous by nature and too ready to trust others. Their intelligence is insufficient to discern truth from falsehood, to gauge depth from shallowness. Their learning is narrow, and they cannot appraise things. When they chance upon someone who praises himself—saying, “I possess secret texts”—they cling to him and serve him. Yet many of these are vulgar men or mere children who falsely assume the name of a Daoist adept, their reputations exceeding their true worth due to boasting and deceit. Greedy and impure, they seek only profit. When asked for teachings, they force out vague sounds, nodding and bowing, raising and lowering their voices as if guarding profound secrets that cannot be revealed. If pressed, they smile and promise to disclose them later. Thus, students cannot bear to leave, believing their devotion insufficient and their gifts too meager. Their faith grows ever more reverent; they offer pearls and treasures, perform the labors of servants, carry heavy burdens over great distances, endure hardships and dangers, hoping to prove themselves through accumulated toil and suffering, to gain some rare insight. Yet the years pass in vain, their parents’ support squandered, their wives and children neglected. They tread frost and ice, following their master year after year, wasting their resources and strength, achieving nothing in the end.\n\nAt first, the master may have deceived them; later, he may feel shame, but his body is empty, his knowledge exhausted, his abilities too meager to teach. What method can he use to perfect others? I have seen no fewer than ten or twenty such men. Some style themselves with lofty names, lingering in the world for ages; others claim to be three or four hundred years old, merely changing their names to pose as sages among men. Many have followers who serve them. I do not deign to record their names.\n\nI have traveled among the common folk, where the unlearned cannot distinguish truth from falsehood. They praise and exalt such men, amplifying their deceptions. The cunning and false gain empty fame, and their influence spreads, for none can discern the truth. Even the wise may occasionally let down their guard, relying only on their ears, and thus mislead later students. Such cases never fail to evoke sighs.\n\nI have seen these charlatans deceive the world to gain power and profit, and though their punishment may be slow, Heaven’s net is wide but not leaky. Yet it is the earnest seekers they mislead who are most pitiable.\n\nPeople of the world often chase empty reputations, rarely examining the facts. When they hear that so-and-so has many disciples—sometimes a hundred or more—they assume there must be something extraordinary about him. They rush to join, gathering in crowds to serve him, wasting their time and effort in reverence of such ignorant men. They do not investigate further, nor do they realize that the master’s disciples may have gained wealth or eloquence through their service, yet after years of devotion, they have not attained the Dao. Foolish men do not understand that such a master is unworthy of service, nor do they awaken to this truth. How tragic!\n\nTo search for a foot-tall mound in a mountain’s expanse, to seek a tree that reaches the sky, to strain for a whale that swallows boats from a cow’s hoofprint—though one may spend a lifetime at it, how can one succeed? Alas! Future students, though they must make seeking a master their duty, must also take care to choose wisely.\n\nThe narrow-minded, whose conduct is shallow, whose virtue is thin, whose merits and deeds are few, cannot perfect others in the Dao, nor can they repay the profound debt owed to their teachers. Reflect deeply on this, lest your efforts be in vain.\n\nGe Hong said: These Daoists of empty reputation are skilled in deception, misleading students. Many are short on talent and ashamed of their ignorance. Outwardly, they pretend to have studied enough, never willing to seek instruction from those greater than themselves. Like fools, they stand facing a wall, not merely silent but resenting and slandering those who truly possess the Dao, fearing that their own reputations will be eclipsed.\n\nSuch men—do they truly seek the methods of longevity? Their aim is only to gather disciples and exploit their wealth and strength to gratify their own desires. Yet they do not realize how Heaven discerns high and low; their end will surely bring calamity.\n\nThe poor must not falsely claim to be rich, nor the lowly pretend to be noble. How much less should those who possess no true attainment in the Dao’s arts yet keep disciples and students on empty pretenses? Even ordinary people should not harbor envy toward the good—how much more should Daoists, whose very lives depend on loyalty, trust, and open-heartedness? How can they allow such arrogance to fester in their breasts?\n\nMen cannot perceive the divine, yet the divine perceives them with ease. What difference is there between this and standing outside a gauze curtain, unable to see what lies within the chamber, yet acting with such haughty indifference, assuming no one sees them? It is no different from the thief who, hearing the clamor of the bell he strikes, covers his own ears to avoid detection—yet the deaf and blind remain within him.\n\nThose who covet fame, monopolize glory, and gather followers for show, seeking reputation abroad and profit at home, resenting anyone greater than themselves—such rivalry exceeds even the worldly struggle for power and influence. They wield their lips and tongues like blades, using slander and praise to form factions. Outwardly, they feign closeness; inwardly, they are distant. Their faces show harmony, but their actions betray division. They speak of shared purpose in the open, yet secretly harbor the venom of wasps and scorpions. This is what both Heaven and men despise, the very writ that summons disaster.\n\nEven those who study the Five Classics should not be ashamed to seek instruction from inferiors to cultivate virtue and refine their learning, daily advancing in brightness. As for archery, charioteering, basic skills, simple calculations, humble tasks of farming and weaving, or minor arts of measurement—all require a teacher to master their principles. How much more so for the methods of nurturing longevity, which extend years and preserve life? This is no different from rescuing someone from the brink of death. How can one cling to the shame of seeking instruction, enduring lifelong ignorance, never changing even in old age, never repenting even at death? Such are the truly benighted among Heaven’s people.\n\nThose who witness this should feel shame and dread on their behalf, yet the perpetrators themselves remain oblivious, heedless of their own reflection. Even Confucian scholars must steadfastly guard simplicity, outwardly embracing plainness, knowing as if not knowing, possessing as if not possessing, so that common fools cannot exhaust their praise. When questioned, they do not answer at once but respond only after yielding in deference. How is it that those who claim to be Daoists so stubbornly pretend to know what they do not, to possess what they lack, vainly flaunting themselves to pursue ill-gotten gains?\n\nThose who stray and do not turn back only sink deeper, as if some force compels them. One can only assume they feel no shame in their conduct. I do not speak these words lightly but out of genuine concern, for I cannot remain silent in the face of such affliction.\n\nThose who pity and ponder cannot bear to witness an infant falling into a well, yet they refuse to heed bitter counsel when peril is nigh—this is as plain as a diagnosis without taking the pulse. As the *Baopuzi* states: If a man condemned to death could be saved, none would begrudge the toil or humiliation, nor shrink from humble entreaties, for the merit of preserving life is assured. Now, the rabble of miscellaneous Daoists, failing to attain the Great Elixir and the supreme method, will surely never achieve longevity—this is self-evident. Though they may cure illnesses with effects akin to raising the dead, though they may fast for years without hunger, summon spirits at will, vanish or appear at whim, gaze a thousand *li* afar, discern others’ rise and fall, dispel hidden afflictions, and foresee fortune or misfortune before it sprouts, all this avails nothing for their own lifespan. Yet they still feel shame in seeking instruction, disdain serving those who have gone before, cling to a moment’s pride, and willingly embrace eternal mediocrity—such are those blind to the weight of matters.\n\nThe ancients said: \"Life’s benefit to me is vast indeed.\" In terms of its worth, though one were enthroned as emperor, it could not compare to this method. In terms of its weight, though one owned all under heaven, it could not equal this art. Thus arose the parable of the dying king who envied the living rat. Now, governing a state to bring peace, or cultivating the body to attain life—these do not come of themselves but are achieved through deliberate means.\n\nThose who cling to the hollow fame of brief deficiency and feel shame at the temporary toil of seeking a teacher—though they claim not to be foolish, I do not believe it. Suppose a man were spared certain death only to face execution: he would still rejoice in shedding a heavy burden for a lighter one, in escaping searing agony to preserve his breath, and would endure such suffering as greater than rebirth. Yet people remain unashamed of their ignorance only because they do not know the day of their death. If they truly knew it, and could delay mutilation by even a short time, they would surely do so. How much more, then, should they willingly perform menial tasks—sweeping floors, holding towels, exerting themselves for those greater than themselves—to be taught the Way of not dying? What hardship is there in this that the blind fear it?\n\nIf a man were ashamed to run swiftly to escape a wildfire, or too proud to flee the wind only to drown in deep waters, the world would surely call him witless. Yet all know to mock those who do not avoid disaster, while none wonder why they do not fear calamity. Why is this?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* says: Many have written books on the Dao in the past, yet none have avoided the pursuit of florid, clever words to embellish empty profundities. None have thoroughly examined the steps to long life, or sharply diagnosed the ailments of the Way, as diligently as I have. My true aim is to guide the lost back to the path, to recover what was lost in the east at the mulberry groves, to draw the rope for those fallen into the well before they sink entirely. But those who nurture perilous illness and reject bitter medicine—what can be done for them?\n\nWho is without fault? To err and then correct it is like the sun and moon eclipsed yet shining again, like Yan Hui. I also wish to ensure that future seekers of the Way of life choose their teachers wisely. Thus, I offer my most sincere counsel without adornment or extravagant words. My words are direct, my brush unflinching, my pain at the thought of long life thwarted, and my restraint of deceit—what more is there to seek?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* says: I deeply consider that those who study the arts of the Dao and cultivate life often follow teachers unworthy of the task, achieving nothing in the end. This leads later aspirants, seeing their failure to attain long life, to conclude that immortality is impossible. Those who wish to transcend life but refuse to discipline the body or restrain the self in pursuit of the wondrous and subtle will advance only to lose the means of seeking office, and retreat without the merit of delaying old age. They harm themselves within and discourage others without.\n\nAttaining immortality through study is as certain as sowing millet or grain—its success is plain to see. Yet no one reaps fine harvests without plowing, nor gains long life and transcendence without diligence.\n\n**Miscellaneous Responses, Chapter Fifteen**\n\nSomeone asked: \"Can abstaining from grain lead to long life? Among all methods of restraint, which is the best?\"\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replied: Abstaining from grain can only reduce the expense of food; it cannot alone grant long life. Those who have fasted for long periods say they suffer fewer illnesses than when eating grain. Consuming *Atractylodes* or *Polygonatum*, or *Yu yu liang*, twice daily over time increases strength, allowing one to bear burdens and travel far without fatigue. Those who take mineral elixirs and maintain them for ten or five years, or swallow qi, consume talismans, or drink divine water, merely stave off hunger—their bodies cannot endure labor.\n\nThough Daoist texts say, \"To attain long life, the intestines must be pure; to achieve immortality, the intestines must be free of residue,\" and claim, \"Those who eat grass run swiftly but are foolish; those who eat meat are strong but fierce; those who eat grain are wise but short-lived; those who eat qi are spiritually enlightened and do not die\"—these are but the biased views of qi-practitioners and cannot be relied upon alone.\n\nIf one wishes to take the golden elixir or great medicine, it is best to fast for a hundred days first. If unable, one may take it directly, though attaining immortality will be slightly delayed—there is no great harm. In times of famine or hardship, those who know this method of abstaining from grain can avoid starvation in the mountains and forests. Otherwise, there is no urgent need to fast, as the benefits are not substantial. Moreover, those who abruptly cut off meat may still crave rich, fresh flavors. For those who have not yet left the worldly life, abandoned their families, or dwelled in mountain caves, it is better not to force abstinence from grain. Instead, one should regulate hunger and satiety.\n\nThere are now over a hundred methods: some involve taking dozens of mineral elixir pills to avoid hunger for forty or fifty days. Refining pine, cypress, or *Atractylodes* can also sustain one, though not as effectively as great medicines, and the effects last no more than ten years. Some methods allow one to fast for a hundred or two hundred days, while others require daily consumption to stave off hunger. Some involve eating a lavish meal first, then taking medicine to preserve the food, preventing digestion and allowing one to fast for three years. To return to eating grain, one must take *Malva* seeds with lard to purge the undigested food, which will pass unchanged.\n\nIn Luoyang, the Daoist Dong Wei and others at the White Society never ate. Chen Zixu served and studied under them for a long time before obtaining their method. It involves grinding over ten ingredients—such as licorice, *Saposhnikovia*, and *Gleditsia* pods—into a powder. One first takes a square-inch spoonful, then swallows twelve stone pellets the size of sparrow eggs, which suffice for a hundred days. When the time comes, one takes the powder again, and strength and complexion remain unchanged. To return to eating grain, one must drink a *Malva* seed decoction to expel the stones before eating.\n\nThere is also the method of using \"Red Dragon’s Blood\" and \"Blue Dragon’s Paste\" with cinnabar, malachite, and water to soften stones, which can then be eaten. If not consumed immediately, they dissolve completely. Eating these stones to satiety strengthens the body.\n\nAnother method is the \"Stone-Drawing Powder\": a square-inch spoonful is added to a *dou* of white stones and boiled in water until tender, like taro, to replace grain. Zhang Taixuan and his family, along with dozens of disciples, lived in Linlü Mountain and ate stones this way for over ten years, remaining robust. However, this requires white stones, unlike the \"Red Dragon’s Blood\" and \"Blue Dragon’s Paste\" methods, which can use any stone but require firewood for boiling.\n\nSome use talismans, some water, some both. Others eat nine jujubes daily with one or two *sheng* of wine. Some consume the twelve *shi* of qi, starting at midnight, counting down from nine nines to five fives. In spring, they face east to ingest the green qi of Jupiter into the liver; in summer, they take the red qi of Mars into the heart; in the three months of each season, they consume the yellow qi of Saturn into the spleen; in autumn, they take the white qi of Venus into the lungs; in winter, they ingest the black qi of Mercury into the kidneys.\n\nThe Daoist Qie Yuanjie of Mount Song consumed the essence of the six *wu* days, which was highly effective. For example, during the ten-day period of *jiazi*, if the essence of *wuchen* is present, one faces the direction of *chen* and swallows qi for the entire ten days. When the next *jia* day arrives, one turns to the *wu* of that period.\n\nThe method of Gan Shi involves summoning the Jade Maidens of the Six *Jia* and Six *Ding*, each with their own names, and reciting incantations over water before drinking it—this can even render cattle and horses free from hunger. Alternatively, one may meditate on the spirit within the spleen, named Yellow Skirt Child, and by closing the mouth, ingest internal *qi*. All these methods yield genuine results. I have personally witnessed many who practiced grain avoidance for two or three years, their bodies light, complexions radiant, and resistant to wind, cold, heat, and dampness. Most were not stout.\n\nThough I have not seen those who abstained from grain for decades, it is certain that ordinary people cannot survive beyond ten days without food. Yet those who have practiced this for years remain unharmed—how could one doubt its long-term efficacy? Those who attempt grain avoidance often fear they cannot endure, but when questioned, practitioners all report initial weakness followed by gradual strength, improving month by month and year by year. Thus, it is indeed sustainable.\n\nThose who attain longevity and the Dao invariably do so through consuming elixirs and ingesting *qi*—this is no falsehood. However, those who take elixirs or abstain from grain typically experience extreme emaciation at first. Those who use talismanic water or solely ingest *qi* grow fatigued and thin within forty days, but thereafter regain vigor.\n\nMaster Zheng said, \"By nature, I did not drink much wine. Once, while dwelling in Copper Mountain, I abstained from grain for over two years and could drink several *dou* of wine without intoxication. From this, one may infer that fasting enhances resistance to toxins, which in turn makes one less susceptible to illness.\" I then asked how he obtained wine in the mountains. Master Zheng replied, \"First, brew fine cloud-liquid without pressing or straining. Then, mix it with powdered cinnamon, aconite, licorice, and five or six other ingredients, form them into pills, and dry them in the sun. Dropping one pill the size of a chicken’s egg into a *dou* of water instantly produces fine wine.\"\n\nThere is also the Yellow Emperor’s method for Cloud-Liquid Springs: combine sprouted rice with seven or eight medicinal ingredients, and add one *sheng* to a vessel of water—like the water infused with thousand-year-old vinegar—never depleting, its flavor always excellent and unchanging, greatly benefiting those who drink it.\n\nThough talismanic water and grain avoidance may initially cause emaciation, they are advisable when combined with proper knowledge. In times of sudden famine, when there is no time to prepare elixirs, talismanic water is the superior choice.\n\nThere was a man named Feng who solely ingested *qi* and abstained from grain for three years. I observed him climbing mountains while carrying a load of over one *hu*, walking all day without fatigue. Occasionally, he drew his bow but spoke little, and when he did, he refused to raise his voice. When asked why, he said, \"Abstaining from grain depletes essence and expends *qi*—speaking loudly is the greatest taboo.\"\n\nI have also repeatedly seen shallow Daoists who, seeking to feign marvels and gain fame for fasting, in truth know nothing of the Way. They merely pretend to avoid porridge and rice while secretly consuming wine by the *dou* at midday, along with dried meats, preserved fruits, dates, chestnuts, and eggs—never ceasing to eat. Some devour large quantities of meat, swallowing the juices and spitting out the dregs, consuming dozens of *jin* in a day. This is nothing more than crafting fine cuisine.\n\nOrdinary wine drinkers who consume dried meats and forgo grain can endure half a year or even a full year without distress—yet this cannot be called grain avoidance.\n\nIn Wu, the Daoist Shi Chun practiced *qi*-ingestion to treat illnesses. He would wait until the patient recovered—sometimes a hundred days, sometimes ten—before eating. When Emperor Jing of Wu heard of this, he remarked, \"This cannot last; he will surely die of hunger.\" He summoned Chun, locked him up, and had him closely guarded. Chun requested only three or four *sheng* of water daily. Over a year passed, and his complexion grew even more radiant, his strength undiminished. When the emperor asked if he could endure for a long time, Chun replied, \"There is no limit—I could go for decades, fearing only old age, not hunger.\" The emperor then released him.\n\nJudging by Chun’s case, it is clear that grain avoidance cannot extend lifespan. Even today, some practice Chun’s method.\n\nWhen asked about the method to resist cold, *Baopuzi* said: \"On the day of the Beginning of Winter, consume the talismans of the Six *Bing* and Six *Ding*, or close the mouth and circulate the *qi* of the Five Fires one thousand two hundred times—this will prevent cold for the entire twelfth month. Alternatively, drink Solar Wine, take the Purple Quartz Rice-Lacquer Powder, or first consume one Male Pill followed by two Female Pills (in another version, first Female then Male)—these can also endure a day and night without cold.\"\n\nThe Female Pill uses orpiment, azurite, *bin*-stone, and magnetite.\nThe Male Pill uses realgar, cinnabar, and chalcanthite.\n\nHowever, these offer no benefit to longevity.\n\nWhen asked about the method to resist heat, *Baopuzi* said: \"On the day of the Beginning of Summer, consume the talismans of the Six *Ren* and Six *Gui*, or circulate the *qi* of the Six *Gui*, or take the Black Water (or Ice) Pills, or the Flying Frost Powder. However, the latter requires the bark of trees from Mount Xiaoqiu and the blood of a black snake traveling north at noon on the fifth day of the fifth month—few have succeeded in preparing it. Only Fang Bozi and Wang Zhongdu could wear heavy furs in summer, stand in the midday sun surrounded by twelve braziers, and neither complain of heat nor sweat—undoubtedly, they used this method.\"\n\nWhen asked about the method to repel weapons, *Baopuzi* said: \"I heard that Emperor Wen of Wu once received essential teachings from Master Jie, who said that merely writing the characters for the Northern Dipper and the sun and moon would render one unafraid of blades. The emperor tested this on dozens of his attendants, who led charges and plunged into battle, yet none were harmed for life.\"\n\nMaster Zheng said, \"Simply reciting the names of the Five Weapons also proves effective. The sword is named Great Chamber and governed by the Void Star; the halberd is named Crooked Tension and governed by the Root Star; the arrow is named Wandering and governed by Mars; the blade is named Great Wound and governed by the Horn Star; the crossbow is named Distant Gaze and governed by the Spread Star; the shield is named Great General and governed by the Three Stars.\"\n\nBefore battle, one should quietly recite these names. Alternatively, on the fifth day of the fifth month, create the Red Spirit Talisman and wear it over the heart; or on the day of *bingwu* at noon, make the Swallow Lord and Dragon-Tiger Double-Pouch Talismans, replacing the yearly talisman annually, the monthly talisman monthly, and the daily talisman daily. One may also wear the Talisman of the Messenger of Military Trust of the Queen Mother of the West, the Talisman of Mars and the Vermilion Bird, the Talisman of the Southern Culmen and Melting Metal, or the Talismans of Repelling Blades and Zhurong. Alternatively, apply the Jade Tablet Powder, bathe in forbidden onion broth, or use the male chaste tree to create the Six Yin Spirit Generals Talisman, pointing it toward the enemy. Or, during a lunar eclipse, carve the blood of a three-thousand-year-old toad (which has eight characters under its throat) onto the blade one wields. One may also carry the Martial Might Talisman, the Firefly Fire Pill, or when blades clash, tread on the *kui* and *fang* stars while invoking the Lords of the Four Directions—all of which have proven effective. Even today, some possess the method to repel weapons.\n\nWhen asked about the method of vanishing, *Baopuzi* said: \"The divine Way has five postures, but their number is lost to obscurity.\"\n\nYet these methods offer no benefit to the affairs of longevity and destiny. If practiced idly among men without cause, they invite only rumors of the uncanny and strange—such practices are not to be recklessly pursued. They may, however, be prepared for times of war and peril, employed in extremity to avert disaster.\n\nMaster Zheng said: \"Wearing the Great *Lü* Talisman for ten days, one may vanish by turning left or appear by turning right.\" Alternatively, one may apply the Jade *Yan* Pill to the body, use the Snake’s Foot Powder, carry the Mother of Separation Grass, or break the Green Dragon Grass to subdue the Six *Ding* Spirits. One may enter a bamboo field and grasp the Great Pivot’s soil, or construct a Stone Chamber of the River Dragon and vanish beneath the cloud canopy’s shade. One may lie concealed in a clear, cold abyss to traverse the paths of the Dark Gate, ride the Heavenly One’s horse to wander the Purple Chamber, ascend the Heavenly One’s Bright Hall, or enter the Golden Coffer of the Jade Maiden. One may stand beneath the Three Canopies with the back toward the *Fu* star and face the *Guan* star, or cast off one’s headscarf and remove one’s shoes—[text missing]—boiling gall, wearing talismans, residing in guarded seclusion, using the clear liquid of cassia and platycodon, the Six *Jia* Parents’ adhesive, the *Pi Ce* glue, the Horse Mud Pill, the Wooden *Xu*’s essence, or the Mugwort of the Metal *Shang*. These may transform one into a child, an old man, a bird, a beast, grass, or a tree, or into the Six Domestic Animals. One may merge with wood to become wood, with stone to become stone, with water to become water, or with fire to become fire—this is what is meant by shifting form and altering appearance, though it does not allow for prolonged vanishing.\n\nSomeone asked: \"Cao Cao of Wei once captured Zuo Yuanfang and bound him in shackles, yet he escaped naturally. By what method was this achieved?\"\n\n*Baopuzi* replied: \"I cannot claim precise knowledge of what Master Zuo employed, but having perused various esoteric texts, I find methods such as taking adlay seeds thrice monthly with the Three-Five Yin Elixir, or using paired teeth and the Yang Embryo. Alternatively, one might leap and cast off restraints on the seventh day of the seventh month while facing east, or wear the single garment of the Dragon’s Child on a stone on the fifth day of the fifth month. One might don the robe pierced by lightning on the Summer Solstice, or use the twenty-one-character talisman of celestial patterns, or the blood of one’s father who has departed, or the Jade Child’s Remnant Grain. Combining the Mountain Lord’s Eye, the River Earl’s Remnant Grain, and the dregs of floating clouds to anoint oneself—all these may bring about self-liberation. Yet Master Zuo’s transformations were boundless and not necessarily confined to such methods. When employing the Six *Jia* to alter one’s true form, it cannot be grasped.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Can one who practices the Dao avoid illness?\"\n\n*Baopuzi* said: \"Those who fully embody the principles of nurturing life both ingest divine medicines and practice *qi*-circulation without cease, conducting daily *daoyin* to invigorate the constructive and protective energies, ensuring no blockages. They further employ the arts of the bedchamber with moderation, regulate their diet, avoid wind and dampness, and guard against what they cannot endure—thus they may avoid illness. Yet those who dwell among men often find their resolve divided, their practice inconsistent, and their diligence lacking, so they cannot escape minor ailments.\n\nIf one merely harbors faith in the Dao without engaging in practices that benefit the self, and if one’s destiny lies under the baleful stars of *gu* and *xu*, with the body vulnerable to harm, then the Three Corpses will exploit one’s weakness. On perilous days and inauspicious months, when one enters the realm of fatal illness, they summon malevolent *qi* and recklessly invite demons and specters to wreak havoc. When the Six Calamities converge and the Three Punishments align, disaster is assured. Those still in their prime may develop various illnesses, while those already afflicted will see their conditions worsen. Thus, the ancients who first pursued the Dao invariably studied medicine as well, to remedy immediate misfortunes.\n\nYet common Daoists, ignorant of this principle, rely on what they have heard—methods largely unrelated to healing. Unable to withdraw from the world and seclude themselves to focus solely on inner practices, they lack means to repel illness. When sickness strikes, they are even less capable than ordinary people who specialize in herbal remedies. They are like those who, attempting to advance, cannot master the steps of Handan, and in retreat, lose even the fundamentals of Shouling—utterly bereft.\n\nI have seen the *Golden Coffer* and *Green Satchel* compiled by Dai Ba and Hua Tuo, the *Yellow Silk Prescriptions* of Cui Zhongshu, and the miscellaneous formulas of a hundred schools—some five hundred scrolls in all. Gan, Hu, Lü, Fu, Zhou Shi, Gan Tangtong, Ruan Nanhe, and others each compiled collections of emergency remedies for sudden afflictions, ranging from one hundred and ten to ninety-four, eighty-five, or forty-six entries. The world regards these as exhaustive and precise, beyond improvement.\n\nYet upon close examination, I find them woefully incomplete, lacking remedies for many urgent conditions. They are disorganized, jumbled, and without clear structure, making it difficult to locate and apply treatments swiftly. For acute and violent illnesses, they prescribe costly medicines—dozens of varieties—accessible only to the wealthy residing in the capital, who can afford to stockpile them. Moreover, they often recommend acupuncture, yet fail to clarify the precise locations and measurements, merely listing the names of points and channels. Without prior study of the *Mingtang*, *Liuzhu*, and diagrams of the body’s pathways, how can one comprehend them?\n\nI have compiled a work in one hundred scrolls titled *The Jade Bureau Prescriptions*, organizing ailments by name in a coherent sequence, avoiding confusion. Ninety-three scrolls consist of straightforward, easily applied remedies, readily available even in remote villages. A glance suffices to find treatments for all urgent illnesses. With this book in one’s home, physicians become unnecessary. Most doctors inherit their profession as a family trade, possessing fame without true skill, cultivating empty reputations for profit. The poor and reclusive cannot afford their services, and those who do summon them often suffer from their errors. Far better to master the essentials oneself than to rely on ignorant physicians. Yet physicians are not always available, and even when found, they may refuse immediate aid. By the time they deign to act, the illness has penetrated the interstices, becoming a deep-seated malady in the vital organs—beyond cure. In cases of sudden, severe illness, traveling far to seek help often results in needless death.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Can one foresee future fortune or misfortune, safety or peril, and thus make informed decisions in advance? Is this the mark of one who has attained the Dao?\"\n\n*Baopuzi* replied: \"Observing celestial patterns above and earthly principles below, divining the winds and *qi*, casting milfoil stalks, calculating the Three *Qi*, pacing the Nine Palaces, consulting the Eight Trigrams, examining the positions of flying and hidden stars, diagnosing omens in phenomena, and interpreting fortune and misfortune through cracks in tortoise shells—these are all inferior arts, laborious and unreliable. To perceive all under heaven without stepping beyond one’s curtains—*that* is the work of one who has entered the divine.\n\nAlternatively, one may summon the celestial texts of the Three Sovereigns to invoke the Lords of Life and Peril, the Five Marchmounts, the spirits of the paths and crossroads, and the Six *Ding* deities, causing them to appear and answer questions on all matters. Thus, fortune and misfortune become as clear as if held in the palm, and nothing, however distant or obscure, remains unknown.\n\nOr one may summon the Six Yin Jade Maidens, a process requiring sixty days to complete. Once accomplished, they may be commanded at will. One may also summon the Eight Historians, who are the essences of the Eight Trigrams.\"\n\nOr this is sufficient to foresee what has yet to take shape.\n\nAlternatively, one may ingest *ge* flower, autumn *ma* pollen, or a *daogui* of powder the size of a square *cun* spoon. Suddenly, as if overcome by sleep, one hears voices speaking of matters one was unaware of—fortune and misfortune are instantly determined.\n\nOr one may use a bright mirror of nine *cun* or larger to gaze upon oneself, focusing one’s thoughts for seven days and nights. On the seventh night, one will behold divine immortals—whether male or female, old or young. After a single revelation, the mind will inherently know matters from a thousand *li* away as they unfold.\n\nThe mirror may be used singly or in pairs, called the Sun and Moon Mirrors. If four are used, they are called the Four Compasses, each placed to the front, back, left, and right when gazing. With the Four Compasses, the spirits that appear are numerous—some soaring freely, others riding dragons or tigers, their crowns and robes resplendent in colors unseen in the mortal world. All have their own scriptures and illustrations. To cultivate this Dao, one must first silently recite the names, titles, and ranks of the spirits one seeks to summon, memorizing their attire and regalia. Without this, one may forget their identities upon sudden arrival, or become startled and harmed by them.\n\nThe practice demands stillness and seclusion, preferably in quiet groves or secluded forests, where external forms do not catch the eye and extraneous sounds do not reach the ear. Only then will the Dao surely come to fruition.\n\nThe Three Lads and Nine Maidens, the Longevity Lord with Nine Heads and a Serpent’s Body, and the One Hundred Twenty Officials—though they may appear, one must not gaze upon them too closely. If they question or rebuke you, do not respond. If attendants, radiant warriors, armored soldiers, or those riding dragons and tigers arrive with clamorous drums and pipes, do not lift your eyes or speak to them. Instead, concentrate solely on visualizing the true form of Lord Lao. Once the true form of Lord Lao appears, rise and bow twice.\n\nThe true form of Lord Lao is thus: his surname is Li, his given name Dan, and his courtesy name Boyang. He stands nine *chi* tall, with a yellow complexion, a prominent nose, and elegant brows five *cun* long. His ears measure seven *cun*, and his forehead bears three lines extending from top to bottom. His feet display the Eight Trigrams. He rests upon a bed of divine tortoise, with halls of gold and jade, steps of white silver, and robes of five-colored clouds. He wears a layered crown and wields a sword of sharp steel. One hundred twenty youths attend him: twelve Azure Dragons to his left, twenty-six White Tigers to his right, twenty-four Vermilion Birds before him, and seventy-two Dark Warriors behind. Twelve *Qiongqi* beasts precede him, and thirty-six *Pixie* beasts follow. Thunder and lightning blaze above, radiant and dazzling. This description comes from the immortal scriptures.\n\nUpon beholding Lord Lao, one’s years and lifespan extend, and the mind becomes as bright as the sun and moon, knowing all things without effort.\n\nSomeone asked about the Dao of strengthening teeth. The Master Who Embraces Simplicity replied: \"One who can nourish them with the Flowery Pond and steep them in sweet liquor, brushing them three hundred times each dawn, will ensure they never loosen. Alternatively, holding *dihuang* decoction in the mouth, or *xuandan* soup, snake fat pills, *yushi* pills, or the Nine Thorns Powder, will secure those already loose and cure those afflicted with worms. Taking the Spirit-Flight Powder can even regrow teeth that have fallen out.\"\n\nSomeone asked about the Dao of sharpening hearing. The Master Who Embraces Simplicity replied: \"One who can practice Dragon Leading, Tiger Guiding, Bear Stretching, Tortoise Swallowing, Swallow Flying, Serpent Bending, and Bird Extending—bowing to heaven and earth—ensuring the red and yellow light never leaves the inner chamber, and performing these twelve hundred times, will preserve hearing without loss. For those already deaf, fumigating with *xuanxun*, or plugging the ears with a pouch of thorn tips, sheep dung, cassia bark, and sparrow cinnamon, or using *langdu* and *zhige*, or inserting a mixture of aconite and scallion sap into the ears, or irrigating them with steamed carp brain, will restore hearing.\"\n\nSomeone asked about the Dao of brightening the eyes. The Master Who Embraces Simplicity replied: \"One who can draw the ascending *jing* of the Triple Burner (or the outer *jing*), summon the Great Fire in the south, wash the eyes with bright water, and warm them with sunlight, or burn the *Bing-Ding* Penetrating Vision Talisman and wash the eyes with wine, as the ancients did to read at night—such methods will suffice. Or one may boil *wujingzi* in vinegar until soft, dry them in the sun, grind them into powder, and take a square *cun* spoonful thrice daily. Consuming a whole *dou* enables night vision. Or one may use dog gallbladder to decoct *qingyang*, *banjiu*, *shijueming*, and *chongwei*, or the Hundred Flowers Powder, or steep *jishe* fragrance and *huanglian* in milk and apply it as drops. All eye ailments will be cured, and vision will become twice as sharp as before.\"\n\nSomeone asked about the Dao of ascending steep heights, traversing perilous paths, and journeying without exhaustion. The Master Who Embraces Simplicity replied: \"Only by ingesting the great elixir can one achieve a light body, mighty strength, and endure labor without fatigue. For those newly entering mountains and forests whose bodies are not yet fully robust, it is fitting to use Cloud Pearl Powder, Hundred Flowers Elixir, *xuanzi* soup to wash the feet, Tiger Gallbladder Pills, Vermilion Bright Wine, Heavenly Male Crane Fat Pills, Flying Knife Decoction, Autumn *Mang*, *Cheqian*, and *Zefang* Powder. After ten days of use, not only will one traverse great distances without exhaustion, but one’s pace will become three times faster than usual.\n\nIf one can master the art of *Qiao*-riding, one may roam the world unbound by mountains and rivers. There are three methods of *Qiao*-riding: Dragon *Qiao*, Tiger *Qiao*, and Deer-Reel *Qiao*. Alternatively, one may ingest talismans and concentrate the mind. To travel a thousand *li*, focus for one hour; to travel twelve thousand *li* in a day and night, focus for all twelve hours. Beyond this, one must renew the focus as before. Or one may craft a flying chariot from jujube wood, binding it with oxhide straps and drawing its mechanism with reversed swords. Or one may visualize five serpents, six dragons, and three oxen intersecting at the *gang* position and ride upon them, ascending forty *li* to reach the Great Clarity. Within the Great Clarity, the *qi* is so pure it can sustain a person.\n\nThe master says: when a kite soars higher, it merely stretches its wings straight without flapping, yet advances effortlessly—this is because it gradually rides the pure *qi*. When a dragon first ascends through the clouds, it rises forty *li* before moving on its own. These words come from immortals and have been passed down among the common folk, yet they are truly beyond the ken of ordinary people.\"\n\nMoreover, to ride the *qiao*, one must first observe a prolonged fast, abstaining from meat and blood offerings for a full year before attempting to mount these three *qiao*. Even if one ingests talismans and visualizes the five dragons, the *qiao* of greatest distance, the others will not exceed a thousand *li*. Their ascent, descent, departure, and pause all follow their own methods—one must not act arbitrarily. Should one violate these prohibitions, recklessly riding the *qiao* risks the peril of a fall.\n\nSome ask: The *Laozi* chapters, the *Tortoise-Shell Scriptures*, and other texts all record that in the years of Metal and Wood following great warfare, plagues will surely arise, sparing but one in ten thousand. May I inquire about the Way to evade pestilence? The *Baopuzi* replies: The immortals’ secret method for entering plague-stricken regions involves visualizing oneself as five jades—these jades correspond to the colors of the four seasons: green in spring, red in summer, yellow in the fourth month (or sixth month), white in autumn, and black in winter. One must also visualize wearing a golden headband and one’s heart as a blazing flame, large as a *dou*, so that nothing may inspire fear.\n\nAnother method: visualize one’s hair spreading to cover the body, with a great star fixed at the end of each strand. Further, visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, with the *Kui* inverted over one’s head and the *gang* pointing forward. Then visualize the *qi* of the five viscera issuing from the eyes and enveloping the body like mist—liver *qi* green, lung *qi* white, spleen *qi* yellow, kidney *qi* black, and heart *qi* red—so that the five colors intermingle. Thus, one may share a bed with the plague-stricken.\n\nAlternatively, one may perform the *Yu* step and invoke the Jade Maiden of the Straight Day, or hold the breath while visualizing a force of a hundred and twenty warriors, each wielding a thousand-*jin* hammer, to guard oneself. Other efficacious methods include the *Shegong* pellet, the Red Chariot Envoy pellet, the Marshal pellet, the *Xuchangqing* powder (a medicinal herb), the Jade Casket Essence powder, the Green Ox Daoist’s Fumigation pellet, the *Cui* (or *Que*) Script Yellow (or *Xing*) powder, the Herb Jade Wine, the *Huangting* pellet, the Imperial Talisman, the *Laozi* Neck Talisman, the Red *Hu* Talisman, and the Peach Blossom Talisman.\n\n**Yellow and White (Chapter Sixteen)**\nThe *Baopuzi* states: The *Divine Immortals’ Scriptures* contain twenty-five scrolls and over a thousand methods for the *Yellow and White*. The *Yellow* refers to gold...\n\nWhite refers to silver. The ancients guarded this Dao in secrecy and were reluctant to name it directly, hence its euphemistic designation. Some texts title the scrolls *Gengxin*, for *Geng* and *Xin* also pertain to metal. Yet most methods remain deeply concealed, difficult to fathom, and few are clearly explicable. The world often doubts this art as fantastical and false, no different from those who disbelieve in divine immortals.\n\nIn my youth, I studied the Nine Elixirs and the *Scripture of Gold and Silver Liquids* under Master Zheng, and subsequently received five scrolls of the *Central Scripture of the Yellow and White*. Master Zheng recounted that he and Master Zuo had once tested these methods together in the mountains of Lujiang, and all succeeded. Yet the rigor of purification, taboos, and hardships were no less than those required for the golden elixir and divine immortals’ medicines.\n\nVulgar folk often mock my pursuit of arcane arts, accusing me of striving to connect what cannot be connected in the world. Why would I do so? If my aim were merely to dazzle future generations with marvels and ornate prose, my *Outer Chapters* and miscellaneous writings—over two hundred scrolls—would suffice to convey my intent. I would have no need for this. Moreover, these *Inner Chapters* are plain speech, devoid of embellishment.\n\nI am also aware that discussing such matters, most people dismiss them as impractical and irrelevant, far less compelling than debating mundane principles that align with common sentiment. Yet I cannot desist from these pursuits. Though I know they will not find favor in the world’s eyes, I persist in writing of them because I have witnessed their efficacy, and the masters from whom I received transmission did not speak falsely.\n\nI am poor and lack resources, beset by misfortune and relentless hardship. Even the roads are perilous, and medicinal ingredients are unattainable, leaving me no opportunity to practice these arts. Now, when I tell others I know how to transmute gold and silver, yet suffer hunger and cold myself, it is no different from one who cannot walk selling remedies for lameness—how could anyone believe me? Yet one cannot dismiss all possibilities on the basis of a single setback. My diligent recording of these methods in writing is for the sake of future scholars who cherish the strange and prize truth, that they may see my work and grasp the full intent of the Dao.\n\nThe arts of transformation know no bounds. The human body is visible, yet there are methods to conceal it; spirits are hidden, yet there are ways to reveal them. Those who master such arts are many. Water and fire reside in the heavens, yet we draw them forth with burning mirrors. Lead is white by nature, yet it is reddened to make cinnabar; cinnabar is red by nature, yet it is whitened to make lead. Clouds, rain, frost, and snow are all qi of Heaven and Earth, yet they can be replicated with medicines, indistinguishable from the real. Even among creatures that fly and crawl, whose forms are fixed by creation, sudden transformations abound—countless kinds, beyond enumeration.\n\nHumans, the most spiritually endowed of beings, may alter their forms: men and women become cranes, stones, tigers, apes, grains of sand, or soft-shelled turtles—such cases are not rare. Mountains become abysses, and deep valleys rise into ridges—these, too, are transformations of great things. Transformation is the natural way of Heaven and Earth; why should gold and silver alone be exempt from being wrought from other substances?\n\nConsider the fire obtained from a yang-burning mirror or the water drawn from a fang-zhu vessel—are they different from ordinary fire and water? When a snake becomes a dragon, or when thatch is refined into ointment, they are no different from those that arise naturally. Yet the origins and causes of such transformations stem from natural resonance, and only those who exhaust principle and fulfill their nature can comprehend their guiding principles. Only those who trace beginnings to ends can grasp their true conditions.\n\nThose of narrow vision and shallow understanding, confined by their own limitations, dismiss the profound and unfathomable as unfathomable, and relegate divine transformations to the realm of the absurd. Because the Zhou and Confucius did not speak of such things, or because the ancient texts do not record them, they dismiss them entirely—is this not ignorance?\n\nMoreover, when common folk see that Liu Xiang failed to transmute gold, they conclude that such a Dao does not exist in the world. This is like a farmer who, after a flood or drought ruins his harvest, declares that the five grains cannot be cultivated. Wu Dawen, the Prefect of Chengdu, was a learned and erudite man, yet he, too, dismissed most extraordinary matters as implausible. Later, a Daoist taught him the methods of the Yellow and White. Wu tested them: melting lead in an iron vessel and adding a powdered medicine transformed it into silver; further refining it with another medicine turned it into gold.\n\nAfter mastering these methods, Wu studied the arts of thorough vision. Within a hundred days, as he lay abed at night, he could see the celestial patterns and his four neighbors as clearly as if there were no walls or fences. His concubine, Yaohua, who had died, appeared to him and spoke as in life. When he sacrificed at the temple, he heard the temple deity respond to his bow, and the altar seemed to move with a sound. Wu then sighed, saying, “Truly, there is nothing that does not exist in the world. Though the Five Classics do not record such things, one cannot dismiss them out of hand.”\n\nYet those unversed in such arts, upon hearing of them, how could they not be astonished and incredulous?\n\nThere is also the case of Huan Junshan, who recounted that Cheng Wei, a Yellow Gate Gentleman of the Han, was fond of the arts of the Yellow and White. He married the daughter of a master of these methods. Once, while accompanying the imperial procession, Cheng found himself without proper attire and grew anxious. His wife said, “Let me procure two bolts of silk.” Immediately, the silk appeared before them. Cheng consulted the *Hongbao* in his pillow and attempted to transmute gold, but failed. His wife came to observe and found him fanning the coals, heating a crucible filled with mercury. She said, “Let me show you something.” She took a small amount of medicine from her pouch and added it to the crucible. After the time it takes to eat a meal, she opened it, and the mercury had turned to silver.\n\nCheng was astonished and asked, “This Dao was near at hand all along, yet why did you not tell me sooner?” His wife replied, “One must be destined to receive it.” From then on, Cheng entreated her day and night, selling fields and houses to provide fine food and clothing, yet she still refused to teach him. Cheng then conspired with a companion to beat and torture her, but she only told him, “The Dao must be transmitted to the right person. If you encounter such a person on the road, you may teach them. But if their mouth speaks one thing while their heart holds another, even if you cut them to pieces, the Dao will not emerge.”\n\nCheng persisted in pressuring her, and she eventually went mad, stripping naked and running about, smearing herself with mud, until she died.\n\nRecently, Hua Lingsi, the Prefect of Lijiang, was a man of great talent, learning, and broad knowledge, yet he, too, dismissed most extraordinary matters as implausible. Later, a Daoist taught him the methods of the Yellow and White. Hua tested them: melting lead in an iron vessel and adding a powdered medicine transformed it into silver; further refining it with another medicine turned it into gold. After learning from this Daoist, Hua mastered the arts of thorough vision. Within a hundred days, as he lay abed at night, he could see the celestial patterns and his four neighbors as clearly as if there were no walls or fences. His concubine, Yaohua, who had died, appeared to him and spoke as in life. When he sacrificed at the temple, he heard the temple deity respond to his bow, and the altar seemed to move with a sound. Hua then sighed, saying, “Truly, there is nothing that does not exist in the world. Though the Five Classics do not record such things, one cannot dismiss them out of hand.”\n\nMoreover, the arts of the Yellow and White, like the compounding of divine elixirs, both require a hundred days or more of fasting and purification. One must also find a secluded place, comprehend the meaning of the alchemical texts, and only then may proceed—these arts are not for those of impure conduct, nor for the dull-witted or those who seldom engage with the numerological arts. Some methods may require oral instructions, which should all be transmitted by a master. It is also fitting to enter deep mountains, to a place of purity, and not let vulgar fools know of it. Yet Liu Xiang practiced these arts within the palace, employing palace women to attend to the work—surely they were not fasting and purifying themselves, nor could they sever all worldly affairs to prevent comings and goings. How could such a practice ever succeed?\n\nThe *New Discourses* of Huan Tan states: Shi Zixin, seeing that he had been appointed as an official in the Chancellor’s office, ordered the construction of a workshop, mobilizing clerks, officers, and even palace slaves and maids to assist him in making gold. When it failed, the Chancellor himself admitted his efforts were insufficient and reported to Empress Dowager Fu that gold was no longer profitable. Yet when he heard that gold, once refined, could be used to make longevity elixirs, he eagerly desired it. He then reassigned Shi Zixin to the Northern Palace of the Weiyang Palace, where attendants were assigned to serve him. How could such divine methods be practiced within the palace, allowing common people to mingle and work together? Even dyeing and bleaching silk in the secular world is not to be witnessed by outsiders—if seen, the process is ruined—how much more so for the transformations of the Yellow and White?\n\nIn all matters, great or small, one must grasp the essentials. Without proper method, even brewing wine, making soy sauce, vinegar, or stews may fail—how much more so for greater undertakings? I once consulted Master Zheng, saying: “The Old Master said, ‘Do not value rare and precious goods.’ In the age of perfect governance, gold is cast into the mountains and jade discarded in the valleys. I wonder why the ancients prized gold and silver yet left behind their methods.”\n\nMaster Zheng replied: “What the Old Master spoke of refers to those who sift through sand, split rocks, drain mountains, and dredge abysses, traveling thousands of miles without fear of being crushed or drowned, seeking rare treasures to hinder the people’s seasons, never knowing contentment, adorning the useless, and even those who aspire to the Dao and seek long life—such men are no different from merchants. They lack integrity, plunge into peril, chase profits without regard for life or limb, and do not cultivate frugal desires. As for the true person who makes gold, it is for the purpose of ingesting it to attain immortality, not to become wealthy. Thus, the scriptures say: ‘Gold can be made, and the world can be transcended.’ Silver may also be ingested, though it is not as effective as gold.”\n\nI objected: “Why not ingest the gold and silver of the world instead of transmuting them? If one makes them, are they not false? And if false, can they be deceptive?”\n\nMaster Zheng replied: “The gold and silver of the world are indeed good, but Daoists are generally poor. As the saying goes, ‘There are no fat immortals or wealthy Daoists.’ If a master has ten or five disciples, how can they obtain enough gold and silver to supply them? And they cannot travel far to gather them, so it is fitting to make them. Moreover, the gold transmuted from medicines is the essence of all ingredients, superior to the natural kind. The *Immortals’ Scripture* says, ‘The essence of cinnabar generates gold’—this is the method of making gold from elixirs. Thus, in the mountains where cinnabar is found, gold often lies beneath. When gold is successfully made, it is a true substance, its interior and exterior indistinguishable, unchanging even after a hundred refinements. Hence, the method states it can be used to make nails, demonstrating its hardness and strength. This is the attainment of the natural Dao. If one can achieve this, how can it be called deception?\n\nDeception refers to coating iron with malachite to turn it red like copper, or transforming silver with egg white to make it yellow like gold—these are changes only on the surface, not within. The *Immortals’ Scripture* records methods for cultivating lingzhi mushrooms with the Five Stones and Five Woods, and the mushrooms thus grown are no different from the natural ones, both granting long life. This is akin to making gold. The pheasant transforms into a clam, the sparrow into a mussel—these are the same as their natural counterparts. Thus, the scripture says: ‘The flowing pearl, after nine transformations, the father does not tell the son.’ It also says: ‘Cinnabar made into gold and ingested ascends to immortality—this is the way of the superior adept. Eating lingzhi, practicing breath control, and swallowing qi grants long life—this is the way of the middling adept. Consuming herbs and plants to live a thousand years—this is the way of the lesser adept.’\n\nIt further states: ‘Gold and silver can be made with their natural properties. Long life can be learned and attained.’ The *Jade Tablet Record* says: ‘All under heaven may attain long life—it is only hesitation that prevents success.’ Mercury congealed into gold can be used to make nails.”\n\nThe *Bronze Pillar Scripture* states: “Cinnabar can be transmuted into gold; the ‘river chariot’ can be made into silver. Once established, it can be accomplished—once accomplished, it becomes the true elixir. Mastering this Way, one may attain an immortal body.” Huangshanzi said: “Heaven and earth possess gold, and I can make it. Two yellows and one red—once established, there is no doubt.” The *Tortoise-Shell Script* declares: “My life is in my hands, not in Heaven’s. When the returning elixir is perfected and gold is made, it endures for ten thousand myriad years. How could the ancients have deceived me?”\n\nYet the trouble lies in this: those who know this Way are often poor, and the medicines may be of low value but grow in distant lands, unattainable in times of chaos. Take, for instance, salt from the Qiang tribes and bittern from the marshes—both are worthless things, not even a coin in times of peace. Now, though their price is unrestricted, none can be bought. As for Qiangli’s chalcanthite, though one might offer ten thousand coins for a single catty, it cannot be obtained. Thus, those who merely know the method are no different from those who do not—how lamentable!\n\nThose who possess the method may suffer hunger and cold, lacking the means to compound it, while the wealthy and noble remain ignorant of the method. Even if they knew it, none would believe it. Suppose some did believe—being already rich in gold and silver, who would willingly spend their visible wealth to purchase the medicinal substances, fearing the regret of casting aside what is secure to chase what flies away? Thus, none are willing to do so. Moreover, calculating the cost of the medicines against the value of what is obtained reveals even greater profit, yet the additional requirements of fasting, purification, and hardship deter them from attempting it.\n\nFurthermore, without the oral instructions of a renowned master, one must not lightly undertake this practice. Even in medicine, the ingredients are quite ordinary, yet their commonly used and effective formulas are kept secret. Consider the following: glue from the secluded women of the rear palace, sealed with the lord’s clay; cinnabar pills; *muhuzi*; golden *shangzhi*; flying *jun* root; hidden dragon liver; white horse sweat; floating cloud dregs; dragon’s offspring; cinnabar-clad night-shining bones; hundred-flower nectar; winter *zou* purification—all are nearby substances. Yet without oral instructions, they remain incomprehensible. How much more so, then, for the arts of the yellow and the white?\n\nThose capable of practicing these arts today do not merely keep them secret because of their high value.\n\nThis Dao, once accomplished, enables one to attain longevity—longevity being the ultimate of the Way. Thus did the ancients hold it in such esteem. Now, among the substances named in alchemical formulas, some may share names with common drugs yet are not the same. For instance, the *Heavenly Maid of the River* is not a woman; *Master Bright of Mount Lingyang* is not a man; *Yu’s Remnant Grain* is not rice; *Yao’s Brew* is not water. Yet when ordinary people see formulas calling for *dragon’s gall*, *tiger’s paw*, *chicken’s head*, *duck’s foot*, *horse’s hoof*, *dog’s blood*, *rat’s tail*, or *ox’s knee*, they assume these are merely substances of blood and qi. When they see *broken cups*, *upturned basins*, *cauldrons*, *dikes*, *great dikes*, *arrow shafts*, or *heavenly hooks*, they take them for vessels of iron or clay. When they see *Hu the Royal Envoy*, *Yigu the Spinster*, *Wild Man of Culture*, *Guardian of the Fields*, *Dai Wen*, *Yu the Bathing One*, or *Xu Changqing*, they suppose these are merely human names. Given such superficial understanding, how could they grasp the profound and secret formulas? No wonder Liu Xiang failed in his attempt to transmute gold.\n\nYet once one grasps the essentials, the practice does not require the talents of sages or great worthies—any person may undertake it. Was Liu Xiang an ordinary man? His failure lay solely in not receiving the oral instructions. Now, I shall record its essentials and demonstrate its efficacy to bequeath them to like-minded seekers of future generations.\n\nFirst, obtain *realgar* from Wudu, its cinnabar hue bright as a rooster’s comb, lustrous and free of impurities. The quantity may be chosen at will, but it must not be less than five *jin*.\n\nGrind the realgar to a fine powder and mix it with ox bile, then boil until dry. Take a red clay crucible with a capacity of one *dou*, first line its interior with a three-*fen* layer of *rong* salt and chalcanthite powder. Then add a five-*fen* layer of realgar powder, followed by another layer of *rong* salt, repeating this pattern until the crucible is filled. Add crushed charcoal the size of jujube pits to a depth of two *cun*. Seal the crucible’s exterior with a mixture of earthworm and mole cricket soil and *rong* salt, forming a three-*cun*-thick layer to prevent leakage. Cover with another crucible, similarly sealed, and allow to air-dry for one month. Then, using horse dung as fuel, gently heat for three days and nights. Upon cooling and opening, strike the crucible to release the copper, which will flow like molten bronze or iron. Cast this copper into tubes, then fill them with cinnabar water. Again, heat with horse dung for thirty days, open the furnace, and strike to obtain the refined metal. Use this metal to fashion another tube, fill it with cinnabar water, and heat with horse dung for another thirty days. Upon opening, grind the contents, mixing two parts of the refined metal with one part raw cinnabar and powdered mercury. The mixture will immediately congeal into lustrous yellow gold, hard enough to withstand hammering.\n\n**Method for Preparing Cinnabar Water:**\nTake one *jin* of cinnabar and place it in a fresh bamboo tube. Add two *liang* each of chalcanthite and nitre. Seal the tube’s openings with lacquer and bone glue, ensuring it is thoroughly dry before immersing it in strong vinegar buried three *chi* deep in the earth. After thirty days, it will transform into a red, bitter-tasting liquid.\n\n**Master Jinlou’s Method for Transmuting Gold (Learned from Qinglinzi):**\nFashion tin into squares six *cun* wide and one *cun* two *fen* thick. Mix red salt with lye to form a paste, coating the tin to a uniform thickness of one *fen*. Layer the coated tin in a red clay crucible, using four *jin* of red salt for every ten *jin* of tin. Seal the crucible tightly and heat with horse dung for thirty days. Upon opening, the tin will resemble ash, with bean-sized golden granules within. Place these in an earthen jar, refine with charcoal ten times, and they will fully transmute into gold. From ten *jin* of tin, twenty *liang* of gold may be obtained. Only crucibles from Changsha, Guiyang, Yuzhang, and Nanhai are suitable, as the locals frequently use them for cooking.\n\n**Method for Preparing Red Salt:**\nTake one *jin* each of cold salt, cold water stone, cold feather stone, and white *bin*, and place them in an iron vessel. Heat with charcoal until melted and turned red, then remove for use.\n\n**Master Jiaoli’s Method for Transmuting Gold (Learned from Jiqiuzi):**\nPlace two parts *bin* water stone in an iron vessel and heat with charcoal until boiling. Add mercury in any quantity, stirring until well combined. After six or seven boils, pour onto the ground to form white silver. Then, in a crucible, combine one part each of cinnabar water and azurite water with two parts realgar water. Heat over a crucible fire, stirring until well mixed, then add more charcoal and boil. Introduce the white silver into this mixture, again in any quantity, and boil six or seven times. Pour onto the ground, and upon solidifying, it will become high-quality purple-gold.\n\n**Method for Preparing Realgar Water:**\nPlace one *jin* of realgar in a fresh bamboo tube, add two *liang* of nitre, seal as before, and bury in strong vinegar three *chi* deep for twenty days. It will dissolve into a liquid. The methods for preparing azurite water and *bin* stone water are identical, though each must be stored in separate tubes.\n\n**Method for Transmuting Gold (Attributed to a Child):**\nFashion a large iron tube, one *chi* two *cun* in diameter and height, and a smaller iron tube, six *cun* in diameter, polished smooth. Grind together one *jin* each of red halloysite, nitre, mica, ochre, and calcite, along with half a *jin* of sulfur and four *liang* of malachite. Sift the mixture finely and knead with vinegar to coat the interior of the small tube to a thickness of two *cun*. Add one *jin* of mercury, half a *jin* of cinnabar, and half a *jin* of *liangfei*.\n\n**Method for Preparing *Liangfei*:**\nTake ten *jin* of lead and melt in an iron basin over a furnace. Add three *liang* of mercury, stirring until fully amalgamated. Scoop out the early-formed amalgam with an iron ladle—this is *liangfei*.\n\nPlace the *liangfei* in the small tube, cover with mica, and seal with an iron lid. Position the tube inside the furnace, then melt lead and pour it into the large tube until it submerges the small tube, leaving half a *cun* of the small tube exposed. Heat vigorously for three days and nights to produce *zifen*. Melt ten *jin* of lead in an iron vessel for twenty days, then transfer to a copper vessel. Once the lead melts, add the *zifen* in portions the size of a square *cun* spoon, stirring to transmute it into gold. To produce silver, place mercury in an iron vessel, add *zifen* to a depth of three *cun*, heat until combined, and pour into water to form silver.\n\n**Master Wuchengzi’s Method:**\nFashion an iron tube nine *cun* long and five *cun* in diameter. Grind three *jin* of realgar and mix with equal parts earthworm, mole cricket, and *rang* soil to form a paste. Coat the interior of the tube to a diameter of three *cun*, leaving the opening four *cun* wide. Add two *ge* of cinnabar water, then heat over horse dung until thoroughly dry. Place the tube inside a copper cylinder, seal with a copper lid, and reinforce with yellow sand. Cover with a layer of *rang* soil, ensuring no leaks. Position the assembly in a furnace surrounded by three *cun* of charcoal, heating until the tube’s opening glows red. Upon cooling, the realgar will have entered the copper cylinder. Repeat the process until all three *jin* of realgar’s essence collects in the cylinder. Mix this with an equal part of yellow sand and construct a furnace of any size. To use, place the furnace in a charcoal fire until red-hot, then add mercury. When the mercury becomes active, introduce lead, and golden streams will rise from the sides to converge in the center. Pour onto the ground to form gold. Each furnace can produce one thousand five hundred *jin* of gold before its power is exhausted.\n\nThis gold, when steeped in wine made from *Vitex negundo* and red millet for one hundred days, becomes malleable. Consuming a pill the size of a small bean three times daily, one *jin* in total, will dispel the three corpses, cure all diseases, restore sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and return the elderly to the vitality of a thirty-year-old. It renders one impervious to fire, repels all evil and poisons, and protects against cold winds, heat, and dampness. Consuming three *jin* enables walking on water, traversing mountains, and summoning spirits for protection. Lifespan becomes boundless as heaven and earth. Rubbing a pill with *Ailanthus* blood and *zhucao* juice restores vision to see demons and subterranean objects, and allows writing in darkness. Coating a pill with white sheep’s blood and casting it into water will immediately summon fish and dragons for capture.\n\nCoating one pill with black sheep’s blood and another with cinnabar-red rooster’s blood, then hanging them above the city gate, will prevent epidemics for a *li* around. Applying it to the foreheads of cattle, sheep, and all livestock will shield them from plagues and diseases, and tigers and leopards will not dare approach. Coating a pill with tiger’s gall and snake’s fat, then casting it toward the enemy’s army from the direction of the monthly *jian* earth, will cause the troops to descend into chaos, slaying one another without cause before fleeing in disarray.\n\nCoating a pill with ox’s blood and casting it into a well will make the well boil; casting it into flowing water will cause the current to reverse for a hundred paces. Coating a pill with white dog’s blood and placing it in a site of sixfold *yin* before casting it into a shrine or temple will summon the demonic spirits, who may then be commanded. Coating a pill with rabbit’s blood and placing it in a site of sixfold *yin* will cause the Jade Maidens of the traveling kitchen to arrive instantly, sufficient to serve sixty or seventy people.\n\nCoating a pill with carp’s gall and carrying it into water will part the waters to a depth of a *zhang*, allowing one to breathe and move beneath the surface. Wearing it will keep one’s clothes dry even in pouring rain. Boiling a pill with purple amaranth and swallowing its juice will stave off hunger for a hundred days. Boiling a pill with lodestone and placing it in one’s topknot will render one immune to blades and arrows in battle; if shot at, the arrows will turn away of their own accord.\n\nMixing a pill with earth from the days of the Six *Ding* and Six *Ren* and applying it to a person’s philtrum will render them invisible. Holding a pill and facing north to exhale will extinguish fire. On *geng* or *xin* days, at the hours of *shen* or *you*, facing west and casting a pill toward the earth will cause trees to wither that very day. Casting a pill while performing the *Yu* step will instantly kill tigers, wolves, vipers, and venomous snakes. Inscribing stone with a pill will cause the writing to penetrate the stone; inscribing metal will cause it to penetrate the metal; inscribing wood will cause it to penetrate the wood, sinking into the grain so deeply that no amount of scraping can remove it.\n\nFor those who have died suddenly but not yet spent a night in death, administering a pill with water from the direction of the monthly *jian* earth into their throat, then spraying water onto their face, will restore them to life. Coating a pill with fox’s blood or crane’s blood and placing it beneath one’s fingernail will allow one to point at anything and transform it at will—mountains will shift, trees will uproot, and people will witness these changes, though in truth nothing has moved.\n\nIn all endeavors of *huangbai* alchemy, one must first invoke the Supreme Unity, the Primordial Maiden, and Laozi, performing the same offerings and rituals as in the method for refining the Nine Elixirs. Incense of five fragrances must burn without cease. Moreover, once the gold is completed, three *jin* must first be cast into deep water, and ten *jin* into the marketplace, before one may freely use the remainder as one wishes.\n\n**The Inner Chapters of the Master Embracing Simplicity, Scroll Four**\n*By Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty*\n**Chapter Seventeen: On Ascending Mountains and Crossing Rivers**\n\nSomeone asked about the Dao of ascending mountains. The Master Embracing Simplicity said: All who seek the Dao, compound medicines, or take refuge in the mountains to avoid chaos must enter the mountains. Yet those who do not know the proper method of entering often encounter misfortune. Hence the saying: \"Beneath Mount Taihua, white bones lie scattered like kindling.\" This refers to those who know but one thing and cannot be broadly prepared. Though they harbor the will to live, they instead hasten their deaths.\n\nMountains, great or small, all possess spirits. The larger the mountain, the greater its spirit; the smaller, the lesser. Those who enter without technique will surely suffer harm—afflicted by illness, pierced by thorns, or stricken with terror and unease. Some see lights and shadows, hear strange sounds, or witness great trees topple without wind, rocks fall without cause, striking and killing people. Others are driven mad, wandering in confusion until they plunge into ravines, or are beset by tigers, wolves, and venomous creatures. One must not enter the mountains lightly.\n\nOne should enter in the third or ninth month, for these are the months when mountains \"open.\" One must also choose an auspicious day and hour within these months. If matters are urgent and one cannot wait, one may simply select an auspicious day and hour.\n\nAll who enter the mountains must first purify themselves for seven days, avoiding defilement. They should carry the *Ascending Mountain Talisman* and, upon departing, perform the *Threefold and Fivefold Circumambulation Rite* around the body. Moreover, the Five Peaks have years of calamity, just as the Nine Provinces experience cycles of prosperity and decline. When a region receives the *Flying Talisman* of baleful *qi*, its rulers and officials should not act—this is also true for dwellings and mountains.\n\nOne must also strictly avoid entering the Eastern Peak in the first or second month of a *jia-yi* or *yin-mao* year; the Southern Peak in the fourth or fifth month of a *bing-ding* or *si-wu* year; the Western Peak in the seventh or eighth month of a *geng-xin* or *shen-you* year; the Central Peak in the fourth-season months of a *wu-ji* year; and the Northern Peak in the tenth or eleventh month of a *ren-gui* or *hai-zi* year. One must not enter Mount Taihua, Mount Huo, Mount Heng, Mount Tai, or Mount Songgao in these years, for the same prohibitions apply to all directions of these peaks.\n\nAll aged creatures possess essences that can assume human form to delude the eyes and test people, yet they cannot alter their true form in a mirror. Thus, ancient Daoist masters entering the mountains always carried a bright mirror, nine *cun* or larger, suspended behind their backs. Then, no old specters would dare approach. If something comes to test a person, one should glance at the mirror: if it is an immortal or a benevolent mountain spirit, its reflection will appear human; if it is a bird, beast, or malevolent specter, its true form will be revealed.\n\nMoreover, when old specters depart, they always retreat backward. One may turn the mirror to face them and observe their reflection: if they lack heels, they are old specters; if they have heels, they are mountain spirits.\n\nFormerly, Zhang Gai (or *He*) and Gao Ou (or *Hao*) were both cultivating their thoughts in a stone chamber on Mount Yuntai when suddenly a man in a yellow linen robe and hemp headscarf approached and said, \"Are you weary, Daoists, from your toils in these secluded mountains?\" The two glanced at their mirror and saw it was a deer. They asked, \"You are an old deer of these mountains—how dare you feign human form?\" Before the words were finished, the visitor turned into a deer and fled.\n\nAt an inn beneath Mount Linlü, there was a demon that often caused travelers to die or fall ill. Nightly, dozens of figures in yellow, white, or black robes—some male, some female—would appear. Later, a man named Xi Bo (or *Zhi*) encountered them while lodging there. He sat with bright lamps burning and recited scriptures. At midnight, over ten figures came and sat opposite him, playing *chupu* and gambling. Xi secretly shone his mirror upon them and saw they were a pack of dogs. He stood, holding a candle, and pretended to accidentally singe their robes with the flame, filling the air with the stench of scorched fur. Grasping a small knife, he seized one and stabbed it. It first cried out in a human voice, then died as a dog. The rest fled, and the hauntings ceased—all thanks to the power of the mirror.\n\nSuperior adepts entering the mountains carry the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns* and the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, summoning the mountain spirits and consulting the *Demon Registers* of stone, earth, and mountain officials. Then, the spirits of trees and stones, the essences of mountains and rivers, dare not test them. Lesser adepts establish the *Seventy-Two Talismans of the Spirit Guardians* to control the hundred evils, or use the *Seal of the Vermilion Official* and the *Twelve Seals of Prime Origin* to seal the four directions of their dwelling—then no evil will dare approach. Still lesser adepts carry the *Eightfold Numinous Staff* and wear the *Jade Talisman of Laozi*, by which they may command the mountain spirits—how could they dare bring harm?\n\nI have heard my teacher, Master Zheng, speak thus, though I cannot fully grasp these matters. My master often told his disciples: \"Those who seek the Dao as if grieving over poverty or lamenting a lowly station—how could they not attain it? The only danger is a lack of steadfast resolve, pursuing the near and forgetting the far. At first, they are delighted, leaning forward eagerly, but soon they forget as if it were nothing. The benefits of a hair’s breadth are not secured, while the losses of a mountain’s weight never cease—how then can they exhaust the subtleties of the ultimate words or achieve the loftiest peaks of the Dao?\"\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity said: The great taboos for entering mountains are as follows—\n- First month: *wu* day\n- Second month: *hai* day\n- Third month: *shen* day\n- Fourth month: *xu* day\n- Fifth month: *wei* (or *xu*) day\n- Sixth month: *mao* day\n- Seventh month: *jia-zi* day\n- Eighth month: *shen-zi* day\n- Ninth month: *yin* day\n- Tenth month: *chen-wei* day\n- Eleventh month: *ji-chou* day\n- Twelfth month: *yin* day\n\nAuspicious days for entering mountains are: *jia-zi*, *jia-yin*, *yi-hai*, *ji-si*, *yi-mao*, *bing-xu*, *bing-wu*, *bing-chen*, and *si* days—these are greatly auspicious.\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity said: According to the *Secret Records of the Nine Heavens* and the *Taiyi Hidden Stems*, when entering mountains in a long month, avoid the 3rd, 11th, 15th, 18th, 24th, 26th, and 30th days. In a short month, avoid the 1st, 5th, 13th, 16th, 26th, and 28th days. Those who enter on these days will surely be tested by mountain spirits, their aims unfulfilled, their works unaccomplished. Not only Daoists, but all who enter on these days will suffer harm, encountering tigers, wolves, and venomous creatures.\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity said: The conditions of Heaven and Earth, the auspicious and inauspicious aspects of yin and yang—how vast and obscure they are!\n\nThe intricacies of these matters are indeed difficult to detail. I neither assert their certainty nor dare guarantee their absence. Yet the Yellow Emperor and the Grand Duke both trusted and relied upon them; more recently, Yan Junping and Sima Qian both employed them as authoritative. The classics and traditions speak of \"governing the calendar and illuminating the seasons,\" of days of firmness and softness. An ancient saying declares: \"Auspicious days are only *wu*—this has long been so.\" Kings established the office of Grand Historian, and all appointments, establishments, and affairs—whether ancestral sacrifices, suburban rites, or offerings to Heaven and Earth—were conducted only after selecting propitious times. How foolish and ignorant it is, then, for even mediocre men who claim to transcend the vulgar to scorn the choice of good days in their actions!\n\nWhenever I have observed those entering mountains without regard for favorable times and days, the consequences have proven real—one must not enter lightly.\n\nAccording to the *Jade Lock Classic*: \"Those who wish to enter famous mountains must know the secret arts of *dunjia*, yet these are not explained in detail for others.\" The *Lingbao Scripture* states: \"When entering mountains, one should use *bao* days, *yi* days, or *zhuan* days—these are greatly auspicious. To use *zhi* days or *fa* days is certain death, for there is no second Way.\"\n\nIn my youth, I harbored the ambition to enter mountains, and for this reason I studied *dunjia* texts, of which there are over sixty volumes. The matters are too vast to master quickly, so I excerpted their essentials to create a ready reference for my satchel. Though I have not transmitted them in writing, I now discuss their general principles. Those of discernment who wish to enter mountains and practice these arts should seek out those who know them—such people are not entirely absent from the world.\n\nThe *Central Classic of Dunjia* states: \"To seek the Dao, use *tiannei* days and *tiannei* hours to subdue demons and spirits, and apply talismanic writing. On *tianqin* days and *tianqin* hours, enter famous mountains, and all evil, tigers, wolves, venomous creatures, and bandits will not dare approach. Exit through *tiancang* and enter through *dihu*—all *gui* days are *tiancang*, and all *ji* days are *dihu*.\"\n\nIt further says: \"To avoid the chaos of the world and vanish into famous mountains, free from worry, use the *dingmao* day of the *shangyuan* period, called the time of *yinde*—also known as *tianxin*. This is what is meant by 'sinking into obscurity in broad daylight,' where the sun and moon lose their light and humans and spirits cannot see you.\"\n\nAgain, it says: \"To seek immortality and enter famous mountains, use *gui* days and *gui* hours—also called *tiangong* days—when one is certain to transcend the world.\"\n\nIt also states: \"When going into mountain forests, take grass from the *Qinglong* with your left hand, break it in half, and place it beneath the *Fengxing*. Pass through the *Mingtang*, enter the *Taiyin*, and perform the *Yu* step while reciting the incantation: *'Nuogao, Great Yin General, hear this: your humble descendant, Wang Jia, does not open to outsiders. Let those who see Jia take him for bundled firewood; let those who do not see Jia take him for a non-human.'* Then place the grass you hold on the ground, take soil with your left hand, and apply it to your philtrum. Hold the grass in your right hand to shield yourself, extend your left hand forward, and perform the *Yu* step to the *gui* position. Hold your breath and proceed—humans and spirits will not see you.\"\n\nAll *jia* days are *Qinglong*, all *yi* days are *Fengxing*, all *bing* days are *Mingtang*, and all *ding* days are *Yinzhong*.\n\nThe *Jiji* hexagram of the *Book of Changes* begins with the first and second lines, where the traces do not match the nine-trace sequence, yet they remain interconnected. One step is seven *chi*; it is also said that one *chi* equals two *zhang* and one *chi* (or, in another version, one step is three *chi*). Glance at the nine traces.\n\nThe method of the *Yu* step: Stand upright with the right foot forward and the left foot behind. Next, advance the right foot again, then bring the left foot behind the right foot—this is one step. Then advance the right foot again, then the left foot, bringing the right foot to join the left—this is the second step. Next, advance the right foot again, bringing the left foot to join the right—this is the third step. Thus, the method of the *Yu* step is complete.\n\nAll arts under Heaven should employ the *Yu* step—this is not limited to these matters.\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity said: The *Lingbao Scripture* states that so-called *bao* days are those where the heavenly stems generate the earthly branches, such as *jiawu* or *yisi* days. *Jia* is Wood, *wu* is Fire; *yi* is also Wood, *si* is also Fire—Fire is born of Wood. *Yi* days are those where the earthly branches generate the heavenly stems, such as *renshen* or *guiyou* days. *Ren* is Water, *shen* is Metal; *gui* is also Water, *you* is also Metal—Water is born of Metal. So-called *zhi* days are those where the heavenly stems overcome the earthly branches, such as *wuzi* or *jihai* days. *Wu* is Earth, *zi* is Water; *ji* is also Earth, *hai* is also Water—by the principles of the Five Phases, Earth overcomes Water. *Fa* days are those where the earthly branches overcome the heavenly stems, such as *jiashen* or *yiyou* days. *Jia* is Wood, *shen* is Metal; *yi* is also Wood, *you* is also Metal—Metal overcomes Wood. All others follow this pattern; extend the principle, and all can be known.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: When entering famous mountains, choose an *jiazi* day or a *kai* or *chu* day, and hang five-inch squares of silk in the five colors on a large stone—whatever is sought will surely be obtained. It also says: When entering mountains, one should know the secret incantation of the Six *Jia*: \"Lin bing dou zhe jie zhen lie qian xing\"—nine characters in all. These should always be silently recited; there is nothing they cannot avert. This is the essential and unburdensome Way.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: In the mountains, the forms of mountain spirits resemble small children with a single foot, walking backward. They delight in assaulting people. If one enters the mountains and hears human sounds at night, loudly call out their name, *Qizhi*, and they will not dare to harm the person. Another name for them is *Nei*; one may also call them by this name. There is also a mountain spirit resembling a drum, red in color, with a single foot—its name is *Hui*. Another appears like a person, nine feet tall, clad in fur and wearing a bamboo hat—its name is *Jinlei*. Or it may resemble a dragon, five-colored with a red head—its name is *Feifei*. Upon seeing them, call them by their names, and they will not dare to cause harm.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: In the mountains, there are large trees that can speak—not that the trees themselves speak, but their spirit is named *Yunyang*. Calling its name brings good fortune. If one sees firelight in the mountains at night, it is merely the work of long-dead withered wood; do not be alarmed. If one sees a person of the *Fan* tribe in the mountains at night, it is the spirit of bronze or iron. Seeing a person from the Qin dynasty is the spirit of a hundred-year-old tree; do not be alarmed, for they cannot cause harm. Those who appear in mountains and waters to summon people are called *Sijiao*; calling their names brings good fortune. If one sees a large snake in the mountains wearing a cap and headscarf, its name is *Shengxiang*; calling its name brings good fortune. If one sees an official in the mountains or only hears a voice but does not see its form, and it ceaselessly calls out to people, throw a white stone at it, and it will cease. Another method: use reeds to make a *ru* or *mao* and stab it—this also brings good fortune. If a mountain spirit comes to call a person and begs for food without ceasing, throw white cogon grass at it, and it will die. If a mountain spirit constantly bewilders people and causes them to lose their way, throw a reed staff at it, and it will die.\n\nIn the mountains, on *yin* days, those who call themselves *Yu officials* are tigers; those who call themselves *Lords of the Road* are wolves; those who call themselves *Magistrates* are old raccoon dogs. On *mao* days, those who call themselves *Elder* are hares; those who call themselves *Eastern King Father* are elk; those who call themselves *Western Queen Mother* are deer. On *chen* days, those who call themselves *Rain Masters* are dragons; those who call themselves *River Earls* are fish; those who call themselves *Lord of the Gutless* are crabs. On *si* days, those who call themselves *The Solitary* are snakes in the earth-altar; those who call themselves *Time Lords* are toads. On *wu* days, those who call themselves *The Three Dukes* are horses; those who call themselves *Immortals* are old trees. On *wei* days, those who call themselves *Hosts* are sheep; those who call themselves *Officials* are river deer. On *shen* days, those who call themselves *Human Lords* are monkeys; those who call themselves *Nine Ministers* are apes. On *you* days, those who call themselves *Generals* are roosters; those who call themselves *Thief-Catchers* are pheasants. On *xu* days, those who call themselves by human surnames and given names are dogs; those who call themselves *Lord of Chengyang* are foxes. On *hai* days, those who call themselves *Women* are gold and jade; those who call themselves *Divine Lords* are pigs. On *zi* days, those who call themselves *Altar Lords* are rats; those who call themselves *Divine Persons* are bats. On *chou* days, those who call themselves *Scholars* are oxen. Simply knowing the names of these creatures prevents them from causing harm.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the method for dwelling in mountains and marshes to avoid snakes and vipers? The *Baopuzi* replied: In ancient times, the Round Mound abounded with large snakes and also produced fine medicines. When the Yellow Emperor was about to ascend it, Guangchengzi taught him to wear realgar, and all the snakes departed. Now, when entering mountain forests and grasslands, carry five ounces or more of Wudu realgar, the color of a rooster’s comb, and one will not fear snakes. If a snake bites a person, place a small amount of realgar powder into the wound, and it will immediately heal. Though there are many kinds of snakes, only the viper and the green-gold snake bite people with the greatest urgency; if untreated, they kill a person within a day. Those who do not know the methods of treatment and are bitten by these two snakes should cut the wound with a knife, scrape the flesh, and cast it to the ground—it will boil as if roasted by fire. When the flesh is entirely scorched, the person will survive. During the seventh and eighth months, when these snakes’ venom is at its peak, they cannot bite people, and their venom does not dissipate. Instead, they gnaw on large bamboo and small trees, which immediately wither and dry. Now, Daoists entering mountains only know grand methods but do not understand the way to avoid such dangers—this is no small matter.\n\nBefore entering the mountains, one should first practice at home. Learn the method of restraint: visualize the sun, moon, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Azure Dragon, and White Tiger to guard one’s body, then proceed. Upon reaching the mountain forests and grasslands, inhale three breaths from the left, hold them, and blow into the mountain grasses, imagining this breath as red, like clouds and mist filling dozens of miles. If there are companions, no matter how many, have them stand in rows and blow the breath upon them. Even if they tread upon snakes, the snakes will not dare to move, and they will scarcely encounter any. If one sees a snake, face the sun, inhale three breaths from the left, hold them, press the tongue against the roof of the mouth, pinch the *duguan* point with the hand, close the Heavenly Gate, and block the Earthly Door. Then press down on the snake’s head with an object, bind it with the hand, and draw a prison on the ground to contain it—it may also be captured and played with. Even if it coils around the neck, it will not dare to bite. If one does not know how to release the restraint, spit out the breath to blow upon it, and it will never escape the prison. If another person is bitten by a snake, inhale three breaths from the left and blow upon them, and they will immediately recover, feeling no more pain. If they are ten or more miles away, one may also perform the breath from afar, calling out their name. For a man, pray with the left hand; for a woman, pray with the right hand, and they too will recover.\n\nMaster Jie’s method: Upon dwelling in the mountains, visualize five-colored snakes, each with one head, then hold the breath and pierce them with bent green bamboo or small wooden boards. Walk the *Yubu* step to the left, visualize thousands of centipedes covering the body, and one will never encounter snakes. Alternatively, carry dried ginger and aconite behind the elbow, or burn the horns of oxen, sheep, or deer to fumigate the body, or carry Wang Fangping’s realgar pills, or place the dirt from a pig’s ear and musk pills under the toenails—all are effective. Also, musk and wild boars both eat snakes, so they are used to ward them off. Moreover, the *yunri* bird and the *yong* both eat snakes, so southerners entering the mountains carry the tails of *yong* and the beaks of *yunri* birds to avoid snakes. If a snake bites a person, scrape these two substances and apply them to the wound, and it will immediately heal. *Tan* is another name for the *zhen* bird. Also, southerners entering the mountains carry bamboo tubes containing live centipedes. Where there are snakes, the centipedes will move within the tube, so one should carefully inspect the grass and will surely see the snake. If a large snake, over a *zhang* long and a *wei* in girth, is encountered, the centipede can restrain it with its breath, and the snake will die.\n\nWhen snakes see centipedes on the banks of rivers or lakes, even large snakes flee into deep pools at the bottom of valleys to escape. The centipede merely floats upon the water, restraining all who see it—there appears a dark green object, thin as a thread, descending straight into the water to where the snake lies. After a moment, the snake floats to the surface and dies. Thus, southerners grind centipedes into powder to treat snakebites, and the wounds heal immediately.\n\nSomeone asked, “In the mountains and valleys of Jiangnan, many poisonous creatures abound. Is there a way to ward them off?”\nBaopuzi replied, “In the Central Plains, the high plateaus have clear and harmonious *qi*, and the famous mountains of the central states are entirely free of such creatures. Yet in the wilds of Wu and Chu, where heat and dampness stagnate, even Mount Heng and Mount Huo—though sacred peaks—teem with venomous stings. There is also the *duanhu*, also called *yu* or *shegong*, which lies in wait to shoot its shadow. It is truly a peril of water. Its form resembles a cicada or a three-legged cup, with wings to fly, no eyes but keen ears. In its mouth lies a transverse object like a crossbow. Upon hearing human voices, it aligns this object like a crossbow and shoots *qi* as arrows, striking through water. If it hits a person’s body, a sore erupts; if it strikes their shadow, the victim falls ill but does not immediately develop a sore. Those who do not know the cure will die. The illness resembles severe cold damage, and within ten days, all perish.\n\nThere are also sand lice, found both on land and in water. After fresh rain or before the heat of dusk, one must be cautious when wading through water, for they inevitably cling to people. Only during scorching days or when the grass is dry are they rare. They are as small as the tip of a hair; once they attach to a person, they burrow into the skin. Their presence feels like a thorn’s prick—minor contact causes great pain. One can remove them with a needle; they appear bright red like cinnabar, moving upon the fingernail. If left unremoved, the insect will bore to the bone, then circulate throughout the body. Its effects resemble those of the *shegong*, and both kill. When traveling through areas with these insects, upon returning to one’s lodging, one should thoroughly scorch the body with fire, causing the insects to fall to the ground.\n\nIf one carries the Eight Substances—musk pellets, *Dushi* pills, *Fangming* pills, *Yuhu* pills, rhinoceros horn pills, *Qixing* pills, and *jini*—they will repel sand lice and *duanhu*. If these medicines cannot be obtained at once, carrying fine musk alone is also effective. Grind equal parts realgar and garlic into a pellet the size of a chicken egg and carry it; this is also beneficial. If already afflicted, applying this medicine to the sore will heal it. Chewing and applying the juice of red amaranth also cures it. The roots of *wuqie*, *xuangou* grass, and *ge* vine—each of these three can be used alone. Pound them to extract one or two *sheng* of juice and consume it.\n\nThe *shegong* hibernates in mountain valleys during winter. When heavy snow falls, search for it where the snow does not accumulate, where the *qi* rises as if steaming. Dig no deeper than a *chi* into the earth to find it. Dry it in the shade, grind it into powder, and carry it. In summer, it will naturally repel *shegong*.\n\nIf a Daoist knows the *Yi* prohibition method and constantly maintains the *Dongbai* prohibitions, guarding the True One, then a hundred poisons dare not approach, and no medicines are needed.\n\nSomeone asked, “When Daoists dwell in mountains, nestling in cliffs and sheltered valleys, they need not rely on warm, layered robes. How do they dare not fear wind and dampness?”\nBaopuzi said, “The *Jinbing* powder, *Sanyang* liquid, *Changxin* pills, *Xunhua* *naidong* decoction, *Duyao* ointment, *Yinyu* *xuanhua* powder, and *Qiudihuang* *xue* pills—taking any of these for no more than fifty days will enable one to resist wind and dampness for a decade. If one ingests the Golden Elixir and the Great Medicine, though not yet ascending to emptiness or becoming ethereally light, the body will be free from illness. Even when exposed to wind and dampness, they cannot harm it. These seven medicines are for those who have just begun to study the Dao.\n\nMaster Yao merely took the *Sanyang* liquid, then lay bare-chested upon the ice without shivering. These are the proven, secret methods of Master Jie and Liang Youdao, who slept upon stones and faced autumn and winter winds without harm.”\n\nSomeone asked about the way to cross rivers and seas to repel snakes and dragons.\nBaopuzi said, “When Daoists have no choice but to traverse great rivers, they should first, by the water’s edge, break a chicken egg, mix a small amount of powder with fragrant herbs, stir it into the water, and bathe themselves. Then they need not fear wind, waves, or dragons. Also, wearing the *Donghai Xiaotong* talisman, the *Zhishui* talisman, and the *Penglai* ritual repels all harm in water.\n\nThere is also the *Liujia Sanjin* talisman and the water prohibition. Another method: when approaching a river, first recite the incantation: *Juanpeng, juanpeng* [or *gonggong, fengfeng*], *Xiang Bodao, qian bi jiaolong, wan zai xiaomie, tian qingming*. The *Jinjian Ji* states: On the *bingwu* day of the fifth month, at noon, pound five minerals—realgar, cinnabar, orpiment, *bin* stone, and *zengqing*—into powder. Bathe in the Golden Flower Pool, then place them in the Six-One Divine Furnace and smelt them with cassia wood. When the copper is refined, temper it with hard charcoal. Have a boy and girl tend the fire. Take the *yin* copper to forge the male sword and the *yang* copper to forge the female sword, each five *cun* and five *fen* long, corresponding to the number of earth. This subdues water spirits. Carrying them while traveling on water ensures that dragons, giant fish, and water spirits dare not approach.\n\nTo distinguish *yin* and *yang* copper: Have a boy and girl pour water over the copper when it is red-hot in the fire. The copper will split into two pieces—those with protrusions are *yang* copper, and those with indentations are *yin* copper. Engrave them with their names. When entering water, wear the male on the left and the female on the right. If merely boarding a boat without wading into the water, wear the male on *yang* days and the female on *yin* days. Also, writing the *Beidi* script from the *Tianwen Dazi* on silk and carrying it repels wind, waves, dragons, and water perils.”\n\nSomeone asked about the method to repel mountain spirits, river deities, and the hundred *gu* in temples.\nBaopuzi said, “Daoists should constantly carry the *Tianshui* talisman, the *Shanghuang Zhushi* talisman, Laozi’s Left Contract, and guard the True One while visualizing the Three Generals of the Three Departments—then *gu* dare not approach. Alternatively, studying the *Lun Gu Lu* to know the names of all *gu* in the world, as well as the *Baize Tu* and *Jiuding Ji*, will cause the multitude of *gu* to retreat. Next, taking *chunzi* pills with red stone, *zengqing* *yeguang* powder, *congshi* pills, *wuyan* pills, swallowing white quartz, or the *Zhimu* powder will make one visible to *gu*, and the *gu* will fear them.\n\nBaopuzi said, “There are the *Laojun Huangting Zhongtai* forty pills and the true secret talismans. When entering mountains and forests, on a *jiayin* day, write in cinnabar on white silk, place it on a table at night, face the Northern Dipper, and make offerings with a little wine and dried meat. State your name, bow twice, receive it, and place it in the collar of your robe. This repels mountain and river spirits, the hundred *gu*, myriad spirits, tigers, wolves, and poisonous creatures.”\n\nWhy must only Daoists, in times of chaos seeking refuge in mountains and forests, know these methods? <*Baopuzi Inner and Outer Chapters*, Inner Chapters, Scroll Four>\n\nBaopuzi said, “The five talismans above are all the Lord Lao’s ‘Entering Mountains Talismans.’ Write them in cinnabar on peachwood boards, inscribing the characters so they fill the entire surface. Place them on doorways, the four directions, the four corners, and key locations along paths within fifty paces of one’s dwelling to repel mountain spirits, *gu* demons, and spectral beings. They may also be affixed to beams and pillars within the house. Whether one dwells in mountains and forests or enters them briefly, all may use them, and no creature will dare harm them. These three talismans may be inscribed together on a single board—this is not the method of the *Youshi*.”\n\nBaopuzi said, “This talisman is the Lord Lao’s ‘Entering Mountains Talisman.’ It may be affixed to beams and pillars within the house. All who dwell in mountains and forests or enter them briefly should use it.”\n\nBaopuzi said, “This is the ‘Entering Mountains Talisman to Repel Tigers and Wolves,’ bestowed by the immortal Chen Anshi. Write two talismans in cinnabar on silk, each distinct, and always carry four of each at one’s dwelling. When moving or crossing water, retrieve and take them along—this is a great divine secret. The ‘Mountain-Opening Talisman’ is named after the thousand-year-old *lüe* plant. When doors open, treasured books, ancient scripts, gold, and jade all appear—guard this secret. The method to the right is largely similar with minor differences.”\n\nBaopuzi said, “This talisman is the Lord Lao’s divine seal against the hundred *gu*, serpents, vipers, tigers, and wolves. Carve it into a two-inch square of jujube heartwood, bow twice, and wear it—it is highly efficacious, the talisman of the immortal Chen Anshi.”\n\nThese three talismans may also be affixed together on the left and right, front and back of oxen, horses, and houses, as well as pigpens, to repel tigers and wolves.\n\nSomeone asked, “Formerly, I heard of Tan Chang, who could walk upon water or dwell within it for long periods. By what method did he achieve this?”\n\nBaopuzi said, “Mix scallion sap with cassia and form pills the size of parasol seeds. Take seven pills three times daily for three years, and one will be able to walk upon water.”\n\nMaster Zheng said, “Simply practice breath-holding until one can sustain a thousand breaths. With time, one may dwell underwater for about a day. Carve a piece of true *tianxi* rhinoceros horn over three inches long into the shape of a fish and hold it in the mouth when entering water. The water will part three feet around, allowing one to breathe. True *tianxi* rhinoceros horn has a red vein like a thread running from base to tip. If a piece of this horn is filled with rice and placed among chickens, they will retreat in alarm before pecking within inches. Thus, southerners sometimes call *tianxi* rhinoceros horn ‘chicken-frightening rhinoceros.’ Placing this horn atop a grain pile prevents birds from alighting. On nights of thick mist and heavy dew, if placed in the central courtyard, it will remain entirely dry.\n\nThis rhinoceros dwells deep in the mountains. On dark, moonless nights, its horn shines brightly like a torch. When its horn is used to stir poisoned medicine into a decoction, white foam surges forth, and the poison’s potency vanishes entirely. If used to stir non-toxic substances, no foam appears. Thus, one may discern its efficacy.\n\nWhen traveling in foreign lands where *gu* poison is prevalent, always stir food and drink with this horn before consuming. If one is struck by a poisoned arrow and near death, carve the horn’s pattern into the wound, and foam will emerge as the wound heals.\n\nThe reason *tianxi* rhinoceros horn can neutralize poison is that the beast feeds exclusively on toxic grasses and thorny, bristling plants, never consuming soft or smooth vegetation. Once a year, it sheds its horn among mountain rocks. If one finds it and carves a replacement from hardwood, matching its color, grain, and shape, the rhinoceros will not notice. The following year, it will shed its horn in the same place.\n\nOther rhinoceros horns also repel evil and neutralize poison, but none match the marvel of *tianxi* rhinoceros horn.”\n\nOne may consume the *Six Wu Talismans* for a thousand days or compound the *Fengyi Water Immortal Pills* with red-spotted spiders and seven-layered water striders. Taking these allows one to dwell underwater. Applying them to the soles of the feet enables walking upon water. If mere head filth can make metal and iron float, how much more so these superior methods?\n\nSomeone asked, “Those who cultivate the Dao often dwell in mountains and forests, where tigers and wolves pose great harm. How may one repel them?”\n\nBaopuzi said, “Ancients entering mountains all carried the seal of *Huangshen Yuezhang*. Four inches wide, it bore one hundred and twenty characters. Sealing mud with it and placing it at the four directions a hundred paces from one’s dwelling kept tigers and wolves from approaching. When encountering fresh tracks, impressing the seal in the direction of the tracks would drive the tiger away; impressing it against the direction would make the tiger return. Carrying this seal while traveling through mountains and forests also dispels fear of tigers and wolves.\n\nNot only does it repel tigers and wolves, but if mountain, river, or earth spirits, or malevolent deities of shrines that consume blood offerings seek to bestow fortune or misfortune, sealing the mud to block their paths renders them powerless.\n\nFormerly, at Stonewater, there was a great soft-shelled turtle dwelling in a deep pool, lending the pool the name ‘Turtle Pool.’ This creature could manifest as a *gu* demon, afflicting people with wandering illnesses. A Daoist of Wu named Dai Bing once observed it. Using the *Yuezhang* seal, he made hundreds of mud seals, boarded a boat, and cast them throughout the pool. After a long while, a great turtle over a *zhang* in length surfaced, motionless. It was struck dead, and the afflicted all recovered. Many smaller turtles also floated to the shore, dead.\n\nWhen suddenly encountering a tiger in the mountains, perform the ‘Three-Five Prohibition,’ and the tiger will retreat. The method of the ‘Three-Five Prohibition’ must be transmitted orally, for brush cannot convey its intricacies.\n\nAnother method: visualize oneself as a vermilion bird, three *zhang* tall, standing atop the tiger’s head. Then hold the breath, and the tiger will depart. If lodging in the mountains at night, secretly take a hairpin from the head, hold the breath, and pierce the white tiger with it—there will be nothing to fear.\n\nAnother method: hold a knife in the left hand, hold the breath, and trace a square on the ground, reciting the incantation: ‘North of Mount Heng, south of Mount Tai, bandits do not rise, tigers and wolves do not prowl, city walls remain unbreached. Seal with a golden lock.’ Then lay the knife horizontally on the white tiger’s path—there will be nothing to fear for ten days.”\n\nOne method employs the Great Prohibition: swallow three hundred and sixty breaths, then inhale from the left and exhale to the right while shouting at the tiger—the tiger will not dare rise. Using this method to enter the mountains, one need not fear tigers. Alternatively, employ the Seven-Star Step, the Jade Spirit Talisman, the Eight Might Talismans, the Five Victorious Talismans, the Li Er Talisman, the Great Peace Talisman, the Central Yellow Hua-Gai Seal, or burn sulfur powder and ox or sheep horns. Or erect the Western Marchmount Lord’s Mountain-Prohibiting Talisman—all have proven efficacy.\n\nThese four talismans are omitted here.\n\nThis talisman is the Old Lord’s Mountain-Entering Talisman, as described below. It may also be affixed to doorways, beams, and pillars. Whether dwelling in mountains and forests or entering them briefly, all may use it.\n\n**Earthly Perfection, Eighteenth**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: I have heard from my teacher that one who knows the One knows all things. To know the One is to know nothing that is not known. Not to know the One is to know nothing at all. The Dao arises from the One; its value lies in its singularity. Each resides in its own place, symbolizing Heaven, Earth, and Human—hence the Three Ones.\n\nHeaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; Human attains the One and lives; spirits attain the One and become numinous. Metal sinks and feathers float; mountains stand and rivers flow. Gazing, one does not see it; listening, one does not hear it. Preserve it, and it is present; neglect it, and it vanishes. Face it, and fortune comes; turn from it, and misfortune follows. Safeguard it, and it endures without limit; lose it, and life decays, qi is exhausted.\n\nThe Old Lord said: Dimly, dimly—within it there is an image. Vaguely, vaguely—within it there is a thing. This is what is called the One.\n\nThus, the immortals’ scriptures say: If you desire long life, guard the One; when hungry, the One provides sustenance; when thirsty, the One offers drink. The One has a name and a form: for men, it is nine *fen* in length; for women, six *fen*. It may reside two *cun* and four *fen* below the navel in the lower cinnabar field, or in the Crimson Palace and Golden Gate beneath the heart—the middle cinnabar field. Or it may dwell between the eyebrows, one *cun* back as the Hall of Light, two *cun* as the Grotto Chamber, and three *cun* as the upper cinnabar field. These are what the Daoists revere, guarding them across generations and transmitting their names only by word of mouth.\n\nThe One can complete yin and generate yang, regulate cold and heat, spring and autumn. In spring, the One brings forth; in summer, it grows; in autumn, it harvests; in winter, it stores. Vast, it cannot be measured by the Six Directions; minute, it cannot be compared to the tip of a hair.\n\nOf old, the Yellow Emperor traveled east to Green Mound, passing Wind Mountain, where he met the Purple Mansion Master and received the *Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns* to summon the myriad spirits. To the south, he reached Round Ridge and the Yin Jian Tree, observing where the hundred grains ascend, gathering the flowers of the *ruo* and drinking the waters of the cinnabar reins. To the west, he met Master Central Yellow and received the *Nine Additions Formula*, then studied with Master Broad Completion to receive the *Scripture of Self-Completion*. To the north, he reached Vast Dyke and Mount Juci, where he met the Great Hidden Lord and the Yellow Canopy Youth, receiving the *Divine Mushroom Chart*. Returning to the royal chambers, he obtained the *Golden Instructions of the Divine Elixir*. Arriving at Mount Emei, he met the Heavenly Perfected August One in the Jade Hall and inquired about the Dao of the True One. The August One said: “You rule the Four Seas—do you still seek long life? Is this not greed?” Their dialogue cannot be fully recorded; I roughly present one corner.\n\nThe methods for long life and immortality lie solely in the golden elixir; to preserve form and repel evil, only the True One suffices. Thus, the ancients prized it above all.\n\nThe immortals’ scriptures say: The nine-times-cycled elixir, the *Golden Liquid Scripture*, and the *Guard the One Formula* are all stored within the Five Cities of Kunlun, sealed in jade caskets, inscribed on golden tablets, bound with purple clay, and stamped with the Central Seal.\n\nI have heard from my teacher that the One resides in the Great Abyss at the North Pole. Before it lies the Hall of Light; behind it, the Crimson Palace. Towering canopy, golden towers, vaulted domes—left, the *Gang*; right, the *Kui*. Waves surge, skies soar; dark mushrooms blanket the cliffs, vermilion grasses twine the peaks. White jade soars; sun and moon hang their light. Passing through fire, crossing water, traversing the dark, treading the yellow—palaces and gates intertwine, curtains and jades gleam. Dragons and tigers stand guard; divine beings attend. It neither acts nor bestows; the One rests in its place. Neither slow nor swift, the One abides in its chamber. At ease, at leisure—the One does not depart. Guard the One, preserve the True, and you may commune with spirits. Reduce desires, moderate food—the One lingers. With blades at your neck, think of the One and live. To know the One is not difficult; difficulty lies in maintaining it without fail. Thus, one may endure endlessly, evade evil beasts on land, and repel dragons in water. One need not fear *wangliang* or venomous creatures; blades cannot strike, poisons cannot harm. This is the great outline of preserving the True One.\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: I have heard from my teacher that among the Daoist arts and scriptures, methods of visualization and concentration to repel evil and protect the body number in the thousands—such as containing shadows, concealing forms, guarding form without life, the Nine Transformations, Twelve Changes, Twenty-Four Births, and visualizing the various spirits within the body to make them visible. The methods are innumerable, each with its efficacy.\n\nYet some require visualizing thousands of things for self-protection, often so cumbersome they exhaust the mind. If one knows the Dao of guarding the One, all such methods may be discarded. Thus, it is said: “To know the One is to complete all things.”\n\nThe oral instructions for receiving the True One are clearly recorded. They are transmitted on a day of royal phase, with the blood of a white sacrificial animal, using white silk and white silver as pledges. A golden contract is divided—careless transmission renders the spirit ineffective.\n\nOne who can guard the One, the One guards in return. Thus, blades find no edge to strike, and a hundred harms find no place to lodge. In ruins, one may prosper; in peril, one remains secure.\n\nIn demonic temples, mountain forests, plague-ridden lands, tombs, tiger and wolf lairs, or snake-infested places—guard the One without fail, and all evils flee far away. If one momentarily forgets to guard the One and is harmed by the hundred demons, or is oppressed in sleep, immediately go to the central courtyard, gaze at the Auxiliary Star, clench the fists, and guard the One—the demons will depart.\n\nIn dark or rainy weather, simply remain indoors, face north, and visualize the Auxiliary Star. If surrounded by enemy troops with no escape, swiftly enter the Yin of the Six Jia, prostrate yourself, and guard the One—then the five weapons cannot harm you.\n\nOne who can guard the One may travel ten thousand *li*, enter armies, cross great rivers—no need to select days or hours, choose auspicious times to begin work, move houses, or enter new dwellings. One need not consult geomancy, star calendars, or avoid the General of Great Yin, the Monthly Builder, baleful stars, or the taboos of one’s fate—one need never fear calamity again.\n\nThe Way of the Former Worthies has been tested through the ages and proven true. The *Baopuzi* states: \"The Dao of the Mysterious One is also an essential method. It wards off all harm and shares the same efficacy as the Upright One. My *Inner Chapters*, the first of which is titled *Changxuan* (Unfettered Mystery), refer precisely to this. Guarding the Mysterious One is even easier than guarding the Upright One. The Upright One has a name, a style, a fixed stature, and prescribed attire, whereas the Mysterious One is merely perceived at first and sought at noon—this is what is meant by 'knowing the white, guarding the black,' so that one cannot die even if one wished to. However, one must first purify and fast for a hundred days before one may await and seek it. It is obtained in no more than three or four days, and once obtained and guarded, it will never depart.\n\nWhen guarding the Mysterious One, one also visualizes one’s body dividing into three persons. Once these three are seen, they may be further multiplied to several dozen, all identical to one’s own body and clearly manifest. Each has its own oral instructions—this is the Dao of dividing the form. It is how Master Zuo and Jizi Xun, as well as the Transcendent Lord of Wei, were able to appear in dozens of places in a single day. There was once a host who sat with his guest, while another host greeted the guest at the gate, and yet another host fished by the water. The guest could not tell which was the true host.\n\nThe Master said: 'Guarding the One while cultivating the Bright Mirror—when the Mirror’s Dao is accomplished, one may divide the form into dozens of persons, all identical in clothing and appearance.'\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: 'The Master said: \"If one wishes for long life, one must diligently ingest the great elixir. If one wishes to commune with spirits, one must divide the Golden and Watery forms. Once the forms are divided, one may perceive the three *hun* and seven *po* within one’s own body, and the spirits of heaven and earth may all be encountered. The gods of mountains and rivers may all be commanded.\"\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: \"Life is to be cherished; death is to be feared. Yet those who cultivate long life, nurture their nature, and ward off death have never succeeded without beginning with diligence and culminating in enduring vision. Once the Dao is accomplished, there is little left to do. Before its accomplishment, there is nothing one does not do: gathering herbs and plants, toiling in mountains and marshes, decocting and preparing medicines—all require physical effort. One ascends perilous heights, crosses dangerous waters, and labors day and night without rest. Without the utmost resolve, one cannot endure.\n\nWhen one wishes to refine the Golden Elixir and ascend to heaven, the ingredients for the great medicine all require funds that cannot be swiftly obtained. One must rely on farming, herding, trade, or commerce to accumulate resources over years of toil before the elixir may be compounded. Even on the day of compounding, one must maintain purity, fast, and sever worldly affairs. The difficulties are manifold, and one must further apply oneself to spirit visualization, guarding the One, repelling evil, and protecting the body—ever as a ruler governs a state or a general faces an enemy. Only then may one attain the merit of long life.\n\nOnly those of keen intelligence and great wisdom, capable of bearing the weight of worldly affairs and aiding the common good, may undertake this practice and be certain of success. Mediocre and ordinary people, though they may have the aspiration and fondness for it, cannot persevere to the end. Thus, the body of one person is a microcosm of a kingdom.\"\n\nThe chest and abdomen are like the palace halls, the four limbs like the suburban borders, the divisions of bones and joints like the hundred officials. The spirit is like the ruler, blood like the ministers, and qi like the people. Thus, one who knows how to govern the body can govern the state. Loving the people secures the state; nourishing qi preserves the body. When the people scatter, the state perishes; when qi is exhausted, the body dies. The dead cannot be revived, nor the lost restored. Therefore, the perfected person eliminates dangers before they arise and treats illness before it takes form—healing in times of peace rather than chasing after what has already passed. The people are difficult to nurture yet easy to endanger; qi, though pure, is easily polluted. Thus, one must carefully assess authority and virtue to safeguard the altars of the state, and sever desires to fortify blood and qi. Only then may steadfast unity be preserved, the Three and Seven guarded, and the hundred harms repelled. Thus, lifespan is extended.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: \"The master’s teaching says that ingesting the great elixir of gold cinnabar, though one has not yet departed the world, keeps all evil at bay. If one merely consumes herbs, plants, minor remedies, or the eight minerals, it may cure illness and extend life, but it is insufficient to avert calamities from without. One may be afflicted by demons, slighted by the spirits of great mountains, or invaded by spectral beings. Only by maintaining steadfast unity can one fear none of these. Next in efficacy is wearing divine talismans. If one fails to understand these two methods and seeks long life, it is perilous indeed. With four gates, yet three are closed.\"\n\nShould thieves yet find entry, how much more so when all gates lie open?\n\n*Far-Ranging Observations*, Scroll Nineteen\n\nSomeone asked: \"I, a humble man, have been confined by the walls of Confucian teaching, knowing only the Five Classics, the Three Histories, the words of the Hundred Schools, and the vain, florid poetry and frivolous essays of no benefit. I have devoted my thoughts to these for many years. Born into an age of manifold calamities, where chaos knows no end and weapons never rest, where literary arts are scorned and only martial prowess is valued, I have consumed the days of my two heavens in bitter toil, exhausting my thoughts on attack and defense, seeking escape—yet official rank eludes me, and I cannot even avoid the toil of the fields. Moreover, this has drained my vital essence, wasted my years, and brought no benefit to my lifespan. Now, with gray hair at my temples and old age upon me, my original aspirations have withered. Just as I wish to turn back and seek the Dao of life, sudden crises press in from all sides, leaving me no direction to flee, like one crossing a great river without knowing where to ford.\n\nYou, Master, have exhaustively studied the ancient canons and also mastered the arcane and esoteric. I wonder: among the Daoist texts, how many scrolls are there in total? I wish to know their titles.\"\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replied: \"I, too, once suffered from this same affliction. In the past, I was fortunate to meet a wise teacher, Master Zheng. My only regret is that I, his disciple, lacked the wisdom to penetrate the most profound and scale the loftiest heights. Though I served as one of his many disciples, sweeping and cleaning, my talent and insight were shallow, and I was still young and vigorous. My thoughts were not single-minded, and worldly attachments were not yet exhausted, so I could not gain much—this I still consider my greatest regret.\n\nMaster Zheng was over eighty at the time, his temples already streaked with white, yet within a few years, his hair turned black again, his complexion became full and radiant. He could draw a strong crossbow and shoot a hundred paces, walk hundreds of li in a day, and drink two *dou* of wine without becoming drunk. Whenever he climbed mountains, his body was light and agile, scaling perilous heights and crossing treacherous terrain—even young men could not keep up. His diet was no different from that of ordinary people, and I never saw him abstain from grain. I once asked Huang Zhang, a senior disciple who had followed him for a long time, and he told me: 'Master Zheng was once returning from Yuzhang when he encountered a great storm at Juegou浦. Hearing that there were many bandits ahead, his companions urged him to wait for reinforcements. Everyone’s provisions were scarce, so Master Zheng shared his rice with the group and did not eat again for fifty days—yet he did not hunger, nor did he show any sign of what he had done. I do not know by what means he accomplished this.'\n\nWhen writing small characters by firelight, he surpassed even young men. He understood music and was skilled at playing the zither. When sitting in leisure, he could converse with several people at once, answering their questions without pause, his voice clear and his hearing sharp. He could direct those playing the *sheng* and *se* to adjust their pitch without the slightest error.\n\nLater, I became one of Master Zheng’s disciples. When I requested to see his esoteric texts, he told me: 'The essential Dao fits on a foot of silk—this alone is enough to transcend the world; there is no need for more. Yet after broad study, one far surpasses those who have seen nothing. Moreover, understanding human nature allows one to teach simpler techniques to protect beginners who have not yet achieved mastery from various afflictions.'\n\nHe first gave me nearly a hundred scrolls of Daoist admonitions and precepts, showing them to me gradually. I had already seen many of them before, and for those I had seen, I often asked him about the points that puzzled me. Master Zheng said: 'You have the talent to discern truth from falsehood—you can be taught. However, though you know much, your knowledge is not yet refined. Your mind is set on external learning, and you cannot focus single-mindedly. You have not yet deeply immersed yourself in the classics or ventured far enough.'\n\nFrom then on, he promised to show me finer texts. He also allowed me to gradually obtain shorter writings copied on silk and fine linen. Over the years, the total I had seen should have amounted to over two hundred scrolls, yet I could never obtain them all. His other disciples were all tasked with menial labor—gathering firewood, plowing fields—while I, frail and weak, was unfit for such work. Unable to prove myself in other ways, I often swept, dusted, arranged his bed and desk, ground ink, held the candle, and helped him transcribe old texts. For this, he treated me the same as his senior disciples.\n\nHe told me: 'Every scroll of miscellaneous Daoist texts contains valuable teachings. One should only assess their refinement or coarseness and choose what to practice—not memorize everything, lest one waste time and exhaust the mind. Once the Golden Elixir is achieved, none of these will be needed. Yet sometimes, one must teach in a way that begins with the basics to encourage and guide learners, giving them a foundation to aspire to.'\n\nMaster Zheng would not allow others to copy his books. One had to memorize their essence. Even if he lent them for a long time, no one dared to steal a single character. Master Zheng was originally a great Confucian scholar. In his later years, he took up the Dao, yet he never ceased teaching the *Book of Rites* and the *Book of Documents*. His bearing was noble and upright, his demeanor dignified and proper. Those who met him all treated him with reverence. Whenever they had questions, they waited for him to soften his expression before daring to speak.\n\nThe texts I had in my possession for long periods—sometimes a month—were sufficient to transcribe much, yet I dared not secretly copy them. Precisely because Master Zheng was wise and discerning, I feared that if he discovered it, I would lose more than I gained. Even at the outset of receiving his teachings, I dared not act recklessly but only made requests when I deemed it appropriate. Thus, though I knew of drinking from the river, I could never fill my belly.\n\nAmong his fifty-odd disciples, only I was taught the *Scripture of the Golden Elixir*, the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, the *Five Agents Record in the Pillow*, and the like. The others did not even get to see the first line of these texts. Though I did not obtain all his books, I recorded their names. Now, I will tell them to you so that later generations who love these texts may seek them more broadly.\n\nDaoist scriptures include:\n*The Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns* (Heaven, Earth, and

Talisman* (three scrolls),\n*The Pervading Heaven Talisman*,\n*The Five Essences Talisman*,\n*The Stone Chamber Talisman*,\n*The Jade Defense Talisman*,\n*The Pillow Talisman*,\n*The Little Youth

Against Death Talisman*,\n*The Combined Five Hundred Talismans for Military Fire Summoning and Governance*,\n*The Jade Axe Talisman* (ten scrolls).\n\nThese are all major talismans. The remaining minor ones are too numerous to record in full.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: \"Master Zheng said that talismans originate from Lord Lao and are all celestial patterns.\"\n\nLord Lao could commune with the divine, and all talismans were bestowed by the divine. Yet few prove efficacious when used by people today, for their origins are distant, and errors have multiplied through repeated transcription. Moreover, if one’s faith is not steadfast, even correct talismans will fail to work. This is like writing characters: a miswritten talisman not only brings no benefit but may cause harm. Even in writing, people know that frequent copying leads to errors—hence the saying, “After three transcriptions, ‘fish’ becomes ‘Lu’ and ‘empty’ becomes ‘tiger.’” The difference between *qi* 七 and *shi* 士 lies merely in the length of a stroke or the hook of a line. Yet in talismans, the characters are unreadable, and errors go unnoticed, so no one knows whether they are correct.\n\nThere are also those who, by their innate constitution and mastery of technique, find talismans uniquely effective—just as some people, when using musk, naturally emit fragrance, a quality that cannot be transmitted. Even so, one must obtain an uncorrupted talisman and use it with a sincere heart; the effects will simply be slower than for those who employ the true method with innate skill. Still, there is always some benefit.\n\nGenerally, Daoists seeking long life focus on elixirs; talismans and swords serve only to repel demons and ward off evil. As for the claim that using certain great talismans can lead to immortality, this cannot be taken as definitive. In the Wu dynasty, there was a man named Jie Xiang who could read talismanic scripts and discern whether they were correct. Someone tested him by taking miscellaneous talismans for curing illnesses and exorcising demons, removing their labels, and showing them to him. He identified each one and corrected the errors. Since then, no one else has possessed such knowledge.\n\nSomeone asked, “Of all the great elixirs for immortality, none surpasses the Golden Elixir. I have heard your teaching on this—may I ask about talismanic texts? Which are the most important?”\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replied: “I have heard Master Zheng say that of all Daoist texts, none are weightier than the *Writings of the Three Sovereigns* and the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*. In ancient times, immortals, perfected beings, and celestial officials held this Way in the highest secrecy; it could not be transmitted except to those with the name of immortals. After receiving it, one must wait forty years before passing it on, swearing a blood oath and pledging one’s life as surety. These texts are found in all the famous mountains and the Five Peaks, but they are hidden in stone chambers in secluded ravines. Only those destined for the Way may enter the mountains and meditate with utmost sincerity, whereupon the mountain spirits will open the mountain, allowing them to see the texts. For example, Fan Zhongli found them in the mountains, set up an altar, offered silk, and always made a copy before leaving.\n\nOne must keep these texts in a pure and clean place. Before any undertaking, one must first report to them as if serving a lord or father. The scripture says: ‘If a household possesses the *Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, it will repel evil demons, pestilence, epidemics, and all manner of calamities. If someone is gravely ill and near death, a believer with sincere devotion to the Way may hold this text, and the person will not die. For a woman in difficult labor on the verge of death, holding this text will ensure the child is born safely. A Daoist seeking long life who enters the mountains with this text will be protected from tigers, wolves, mountain spirits, the Five Poisons, and all evil beings. One may cross rivers and seas without fear of flood dragons or wind and waves. Mastering its methods allows one to transform and summon laborers without needing to select auspicious days or locations. The household will be free from misfortune. If building a new house or tomb, one may write the *Writings of the Earth Sovereign* dozens of times, spread them on the ground, and observe the next day: where the yellow color appears, one may begin construction, and the household will surely prosper. When others are burying their dead, one may write the *Writings of the Human Sovereign*, include one’s own name, secretly place it in the coffin, and keep it hidden from others—this will protect the household from flying calamities and theft. If someone plots against you, the plot will rebound upon them.\n\nFurthermore, after purifying oneself for a hundred days, one may summon the Celestial Gods, the Controller of Destinies, the Year Star, the Daily Patrol, the spirits of the Five Peaks, the Four Waterways, and the deities of altars and temples. They will appear in human form, and one may ask them about fortune and misfortune, safety and danger, and the causes of illnesses and demonic afflictions. There are also eighteen characters that, when placed in one’s clothing, allow one to cross rivers and seas without fear of wind or waves.\n\nThe *True Forms of the Five Peaks* can repel soldiers and prevent harm from traitors; those who seek to harm you will instead suffer calamity. Daoists occasionally obtain this text, but if they do not practice benevolence, compassion, and sincerity, or if they are impure and unrighteous, disaster will strike, and their families will be destroyed. This text must not be taken lightly.\n\nAs for methods of transformation, the greatest is the *Five Phases Record* of Master Mo, originally in five scrolls. Formerly, when the Lord Liu was about to ascend as an immortal, he extracted the essentials and condensed it into one scroll. Its methods involve elixirs and talismans, enabling one to fly and travel freely through the earth and skies. Smiling turns one into a woman; frowning, into an old man; squatting, into a child; holding a staff, into a tree; planting objects, into fruit-bearing trees. Drawing on the ground creates rivers; gathering soil forms mountains. One may conjure traveling kitchens, summon clouds, and ignite fires—there is nothing it cannot do.\n\nNext is the *Subtle Writ of the Jade Maiden Grotto*, also in one scroll. It allows one to transform into flying birds and running beasts, as well as gold, wood, jade, and stone. It can summon clouds and create fog for a hundred miles. One may cross great waters without boats or bridges, divide one’s form into a thousand people, and fly high on the wind, entering and exiting without obstruction. One may exhale qi of seven colors, see the eight directions and the earth’s depths, emit light for ten thousand *zhang* to illuminate a dark room—this, too, is a great art. However, one must tread the paths of the stars through dozens of twists and turns, which few can master. The *Hongbao* and *Wanbi* of Huainan cannot compare to this text.\n\nThere is also the *Seven Transformations of the White Tiger*: take the skin of a white tiger killed on the third day of the third month, fresh camel blood, tiger blood, purple silk shoes, and duckweed. Combine and plant them on the third day of the third month. The first growth resembles garlic chives and bears fruit; plant this fruit, and with each generation, it will transform. After seven plantings, use the fruit to alter one’s form and appearance, allowing flight or submersion at will. This method is roughly similar to those of Master Mo and the *Subtle Writ of the Jade Maiden Grotto*; beyond this, there is nothing worth discussing.\n\nThis overview is for those who love the Way, so they may know the names of these extraordinary texts.\n\nMaster Zheng was not merely versed in the Five Classics and the Way of immortality; he also mastered the Nine Palaces, the Three Marvels, astronomical calculations, and the *He* and *Luo* writings. There was nothing he did not study deeply. In the first year of the *Da’an* era, foreseeing the chaos of the end times and the coming turmoil in the south, he carried his satchel of elixirs and entered the mountains. His disciples scattered eastward to Mount Huo, and none knew his whereabouts.\n\n*Dispelling Delusions, Chapter Twenty*\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: “One who seeks luminous pearls will not find the night-shining jewel of the black dragon in any but the depths of Hepu.”\n\nTo seek fine jade, one will not obtain a foot-long bi-disc worth a city’s ransom unless from the caves of Mount Jing. To receive instruction in the Dao, if one does not find the right master but lingers in hesitation, hoping for some gain, or clings to the wrong teacher, one will ultimately achieve nothing—wasting effort, hindering progress. Though one may later regret it bitterly, it will be too late.\n\nEven in mundane, simple matters, one cannot gain knowledge by mere sitting; how much less so with the affairs of immortals and transcendents? Though one be sagely or wise, there is no way to comprehend them alone. They cannot be attained through prolonged reflection, nor sought by groping blindly. One must find a teacher who is both profoundly learned and broadly versed—yet even then, it is like scooping water from the vast sea or felling trees in an endless forest. The difficulty lies not in the scarcity of resources, but in one’s own limited strength.\n\nWhat tigers and leopards leave behind, raccoons and rats fight over. What Tao Zhu discards, Yuan Xian lacks. If one’s teacher is narrow in vision and shallow in learning, their knowledge will be inherently limited, their insights meager and unremarkable. What they treasure and keep secret is already imperfect; if they further dilute their coarse teachings to instruct others, how can any achievement be possible?\n\nIt is like borrowing grain from the gates of Boyi and Shuqi, or seeking warmth from the household of Qian Lou—what one obtains will be no more than acorns and coarse cloth, never a feast of prime beef or robes of brocade and fox fur.\n\nSome cling to mediocre teachers and never awaken; others, though fortunate enough to encounter a true master, fail to seek diligently. Such losses, born of unawareness, cannot be recovered. Discerning the depth of others is truly no easy task—this is why the ancients found it so difficult.\n\nWhite stone resembles jade, and the treacherous resemble the worthy. The worthy conceal themselves further, seeming as if they possess nothing, while the treacherous flaunt their emptiness as if it were substance. Without the utmost clarity, how can one distinguish between them?\n\nThose who persist with mediocre teachers do not do so because they recognize their ignorance and choose to remain; rather, they genuinely believe such instruction is sufficient. Those who encounter a true master yet fail to serve them do not do so because they grasp the master’s depth and cannot bring themselves to ask; rather, they genuinely believe there is no difference.\n\nFor one who truly knows the essential Dao is without desire for worldly things, does not chase after worldly praise—how then would they display themselves to the common crowd?\n\nThe shallow and superficial, in their multitude, are often boastful and self-aggrandizing. They adopt stern expressions and rare tones to adorn their falsehoods, which suffice to delude and bewilder later learners. Boldly uttering grand claims, they declare they have ascended famous mountains and met immortals. Those who hear such words in haste, unable to calmly examine and verify them, seldom detect the deception.\n\nIn the past, I frequently encountered miscellaneous wandering Daoists flocking to the gates of the wealthy, instructing their followers to fabricate empty reputations, claiming they had already lived four or five hundred years. When someone happened to inquire about their age, they would feign ignorance, smiling and nodding vaguely, saying, \"I must be eighty or ninety now.\" They would then boast, \"I once fasted in the Hua Yin Mountains for fifty years, then spent forty years in the Song Mountains and Mount Shaoshi, followed by sixty years on Mount Tai. Later, I spent fifty years on Mount Ji with so-and-so.\" They recounted their experiences in such a way that, if one were to tally the years, they would indeed appear to have lived several hundred years. As a result, households fond of such tales would gather like smoke and mist, crowding at their doors.\n\nSome practitioners of arts might occasionally possess innate abilities to perceive spirits and deities, and could somewhat divine others' futures or past events, though in truth they could neither bring harm nor benefit. They were like divining stalks or tortoise shells—when people witnessed their minor accuracies, they would hail them as divine beings, believing them omniscient. Others might excel in talismanic water, incantations, or exorcisms, achieving efficacy in dispelling malevolence, yet remain ignorant of the Way of immortality. Some might practice miscellaneous arts and perceive spirits or anomalies, but such abilities did not prolong their lifespan. When questioned about the Way of the Golden Elixir, they were largely ignorant. Upon closer examination, one found that many deceived the world to amass wealth, stopping at nothing. These individuals, though differing in method from thieves who break in and steal, shared the same destination.\n\nThose who rely on empty words are not as credible as those whose deeds provide tangible evidence. To warn later learners and expose such deceptions, one may examine verifiable falsehoods.\n\nIn the past, there was a man named Gu Qiang who practiced herbal remedies and somewhat followed the methods of Rong Cheng and the mysteries of plain silk. At over eighty years of age, he remained sharp and not overly frail. People of the time thus called him an immortal or the \"Thousand-Year-Old Man.\" When Governor Ji of Yangzhou heard of him, he tested and welcomed him to Yidu. Upon arrival, Gu Qiang coughed and hesitated, as if his knowledge were vast but not fully expressed. Enthusiasts then amplified his reputation, and followers gathered like echoes responding to sound or shadows clinging to form, crowding around him. Offerings and tributes flowed incessantly, and his wealth rivaled even that of Luan Da, who was esteemed in the former Han. He regularly consumed asparagus root, which revealed that his body had never ingested the Golden Elixir or great medicines.\n\nGu Qiang had some acquaintance with books and was familiar with historical anecdotes. He claimed to be four thousand years old and spoke without shame of having seen Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang, asserting they were exactly as described. The common saying that Yao had eight-colored eyebrows was incorrect—his eyebrows merely stood upright like the character \"eight.\" Yao was tall and handsome, with a fine beard, and could drink over two *hu* of wine in a day. Later generations exaggerated this to a thousand goblets, but he could not have managed such a feat. I myself witnessed him thoroughly drunk on several occasions. Though a sage, as he aged, his governance declined compared to his younger years. When he saw the Four Assassins and the Eight Elemental Ministers, he relied on Shun.\n\nShun was merely a poor orphan from a humble family, yet possessed extraordinary talent. He plowed on Mount Li, fished in Lei Marsh, and made pottery by the Yellow River, but no one recognized his uniqueness. I saw that wherever he went, he transformed the people through virtue. His eyes had double pupils, and I knew this was the sign of a greatly noble countenance. I often encouraged and comforted him, saying, \"Do not worry about not becoming wealthy and noble—your great virtue is nearing its culmination. The mandate of heaven will surely be passed to you. If not you, then who?\" His father was utterly obstinate, and his brother was particularly wicked, constantly seeking to kill Shun. I once admonished them, saying, \"This child will prosper your family and bring blessings to the world. You must not treat him carelessly.\" Soon after, he received the abdication, and I recalled my words as having been proven true.\n\nI also said that when Confucius's mother was sixteen or seventeen, I divined that she would bear a noble son. When Zhongni was born, he was truly an extraordinary person—nine feet and six inches tall, his head resembling Yao's, his neck like Gao Yao's, and his eyebrows like Zichan's. From the waist down, he was three inches shorter than Yu. Though poor and orphaned, as a child he already loved ritual vessels. I knew he would surely accomplish great things. When he grew up, his lofty discourse astonished people, and learners from near and far followed him, with thousands enrolling to study. I delighted in his words and visited him several times, regretting only that my lack of learning prevented me from engaging in profound discussion with him.\n\nHe often urged me to study the *Book of Changes*, saying, \"This is an excellent book. I privately cherish it, having worn out three sets of bamboo slips and broken three iron awls.\" Now I have finally grasped its meaning. In the fourteenth year of Duke Ai of Lu, a qilin was captured in the west and died. Confucius asked me about it, and I told him this was not an auspicious omen. Confucius wept sorrowfully. Later, he had an ill-omened dream and wished to see me. It was the fourth month, and the heat was oppressive, so I could not go. Soon after, I heard he had fallen ill for seven days before passing away. To this day, I vaguely recall his countenance.\n\nI also said that when the First Emperor of Qin took me to Pengcheng and retrieved the tripods of the Zhou era, I told him, \"These tripods are divine objects. They emerge when virtue is present and sink when the Way is lost. If you cultivate yourself, they will come of their own accord, but they cannot be obtained by force.\" The First Emperor was greatly displeased with me, yet when he tried to drag them out, they could not be moved. He then apologized, saying, \"You truly are a man of far-reaching insight.\"\n\nI also clearly recounted the affairs of Emperor Gaozu of Han and Xiang Yu—such matters are too numerous to record in full. People at the time recognized them as jokes, yet when ordinary people heard them, they believed his words. Moreover, Gu Qiang grew increasingly senile, forgetting things. Governor Ji of Yangzhou once gave him a jade cup. Later, Gu suddenly told Ji, \"Master Anqi once bestowed this upon me.\" He later fell ill and died at Huang Zheng's home in Shouchun. Huang suspected he had transformed and departed, but after a year, he opened the coffin and found Gu's body still intact. All these were cases of fame without substance, causing the world to disbelieve in the existence of immortals, for such impostors confuse truth with falsehood.\n\nWu Wen, the Prefect of Chengdu, spoke of Cai Dan from Wuyuan, who loved the Dao but could not find a worthy teacher. He neglected his family and career, reciting day and night the *Yellow Court Classic*, the *Central Scripture of Supreme Clarity*, the *Observation of Heavenly Nodes*, and other non-essential texts from various schools, his mouth never ceasing. He believed the Dao was exhausted in these recitations, yet ultimately did not know how to apply them. He merely admired their florid rhetoric and, when meeting others, would teach them to simply read the texts a thousand times to grasp their meaning. After a long time, his family suffered hardship, their clothing and food depleted, yet he could not surpass others. Ashamed and resentful, with no way to justify himself, he abandoned his home, declaring he had achieved the immortal Dao.\n\nThus fleeing to a remote mountain range in another realm, he knew nothing of gathering herbs or plants that could sustain him without grain. He could only sell firewood to exchange for clothing and food. For three years he endured hunger, cold, and hardship, yet when recognized by others, he would feign ignorance. Eventually unable to bear it, he returned home—blackened, emaciated, his bones protruding, no longer resembling a man. His family asked where he had been, and he could not admit he had failed to attain immortal Dao. Instead, he deceived them, saying, “I have not yet ascended to heaven, but have become an earthbound immortal. My rank is still low, and I must serve the senior immortals. Gradually, I will be promoted.\n\n“Previously, I was tasked by Lord Lao to tend several dragons. One was a mottled dragon, five-colored and the finest—it was Lord Lao’s usual mount. I neglected my duty, playing dice with the junior immortals, and lost track of this dragon. It vanished without a trace. For this offense, I was punished and sent to the foot of Kunlun Mountain to weed and hoe three or four *qing* of land, where the plants grew densely but were overrun with brambles. The labor was indescribably arduous. By law, I must serve ten years before being pardoned. Master Poxuan, Wang Qiao, and other immortals came to inspect my work. They pleaded on my behalf and even helped me, allowing me to return home temporarily to cultivate further and seek liberation. Thus, I will grow old and die here.\n\n“When I first returned, people asked about Kunlun. How did I answer? Heaven is not measured by its height in miles—when you look up, it is no more than a dozen *zhang* away. There grows the *muhe* tree, four *zhang* and nine *chi* tall, its ears heavy as cartloads. There are trees of pearl and jade, *shatang*, *langgan*, and *bigui*, as well as jade plums, jade pears, and jade peaches. Their fruits resemble ordinary plums and peaches, but they are luminous, translucent, and hard. One must wash them with water from a jade well to soften them before eating. When the wind rises, the branches, flowers, and leaves of the pearl and jade trees strike one another, producing the five notes of music—clear and mournful, stirring the heart. I saw exiled immortals who had heard of this, and none could help but feel sorrowful and grieve.\n\n“I also saw that atop Kunlun Mountain, each circuit has four hundred and forty gates, each gate four *li* wide. Within are five cities and twelve towers. Below lie green dragons, white tigers, giant serpents, and pythons stretching over a hundred *li*, their mouths and fangs as large as three-hundred-*hu* vats. There are wasps a *zhang* long, whose venom can kill an elephant. There are divine beasts—lions, *bixie*, celestial deer, *jiaoyang*, copper-headed, iron-browed creatures with long fangs and chisel teeth—thirty-six kinds in all. If one knows their names, no evil spirits or beasts in the world will dare harm them.\n\n“The deities there include the Headless One, Lord Daojing, Master Xilu, Lord Zhonghuang, and Minister of Deer Gate, Zhang Yang, styled Ziyuan. They guard the jade palaces and do not carry Lord Lao’s bamboo tally. Those without matching tallies on their left and right cannot enter. Five rivers flow from the mountain’s edges, and Weak Water encircles it—feathers cannot float upon it, and birds cannot fly over it. Only immortals may cross. Above dwell divine birds and horses—*youchang*, *jiaoxian*, *tenghuang*, *jiguang*—all capable of human speech and immortal. Truly, it is a joyous and swift immortal realm. I regret I could not roam there freely.”\n\nAt the time, many who heard Cai Dan’s words believed them clearly. Moreover, in Puban of Hedong, there was a man named Xiang Fangdu who, along with his son, entered the mountains to study immortality. After ten years, they returned home. When his family asked why, Fangdu said, “After three years of focused cultivation in the mountains, an immortal came to welcome me. Together, we mounted a dragon and ascended to heaven. For a long while, I looked down, but the earth was already distant. The dragon flew swiftly, its head raised and tail lowered, making me feel perilously unstable on its back. When we reached heaven, we first passed the Purple Palace, where golden beds and jade tables gleamed brilliantly—truly a place of nobility.\n\n“The immortals gave me only a cup of *liuxia* to drink, and I was no longer hungry or thirsty. Suddenly, I longed for home. When I appeared before the Heavenly Emperor, I lost my composure in reverence and was reprimanded, sent back to cultivate further. Only after accumulating more merit may I return.”\n\n“In the past, King Liu An of Huainan ascended to heaven and met the Heavenly Emperor. He sat arrogantly, calling himself ‘the solitary one,’ and was demoted to guard the Heavenly Kitchen for three years. Who am I compared to him?” Thus, in Hedong, Fangdu was called the “Reprimanded Immortal.” Many such frauds exist in the world, their deceptions varied and numerous—one cannot fail to examine them closely.\n\nThese absurd tales are so blatant, yet some still do not recognize their falsity. How much less can they discern subtler deceptions? Fraudsters often embellish their lies with plausible details. Without keen discernment, who can swiftly expose them?\n\nThere are also those who falsely claim to be renowned Daoist masters of past eras, like Bai He, who was said to have lived eight thousand seven hundred years before appearing in the world. Then, suddenly, he vanished without a trace. In Luozhong, there was a Daoist well-versed in many arts, skilled in numerology and alchemy. He posed difficult questions to Bai He, who answered them all effortlessly, leaving no doubts. Thus, he was regarded as a man of profound knowledge—though no one knew his true age, they believed he was nearly a thousand years old. Later, he vanished without a trace.\n\nThen, a man in Hebei claimed to be Bai He, and people from far and near flocked to serve him, bestowing gifts that made him wealthy. When Bai He’s disciples heard of his reappearance, they rejoiced and went to see him, only to confirm he was an imposter. The man fled.\n\nThe Five Classics and Four Divisions have become like straw dogs, discarded lees—mere traces left by feet, not the feet themselves. Books are the works of sages, not the sages themselves. Yet Confucians travel a thousand *li* with satchels to seek teachers. How much more should one diligently pursue the Way of long life, which true immortals hold in such esteem? Yet one must carefully distinguish truth from falsehood.\n\nI fear that frauds like Gu Qiang, Cai Dan, Xiang Fangdu, and Bai He will never vanish from the world. Those who delight in such matters should heed this book and refine their judgment of good and bad.\n\nThe *Immortals’ Classic* states that the pupils of immortals’ eyes are square. In Luozhong, I saw Bai Zhongli, whose pupils were indeed square—truly an extraordinary man.\n\n**Appendix:**\nNurturing the essence of the embryo and stabilizing the spirit are akin to guarding the primordial *qi*. One must merely refrain from obstructing the breath’s egress and ingress.\n\nThose who regularly practice may inhale *qi* through the nose at the time of its generation, then exhale through the mouth, expelling two parts while retaining one. They may then forcefully swallow this *qi*, causing a muffled sound in the throat—this is not the *qi* of the primordial embryo, but merely the ingestion of coarse *qi*. Coarse *qi* resides in the abdomen, yet does not dwell with the primordial *qi*. Coarse *qi* is the *qi* of panting breath.\n\nThough the primordial *qi* is scant and difficult to disperse, it does not rely on the ingress and egress of coarse *qi*. Moreover, one should not even wish to hear one’s own breathing—how much less should swallowing produce sound? When the inhaled *qi* is coarse, it injures the lungs, for the lungs are the canopy of the five viscera, and *qi* descends to reach them first.\n\nThose who ingest the primordial *qi* do not follow the coarse *qi* in its exit and entry, thus transcending the moments of *qi*’s generation and depletion. Yet when one forces coarse *qi* into the viscera of primordial *qi*, it instead harms the person. All who exert strength do so through the *qi* of the multitude—meaning the *qi* of myriad things and the essences of food and drink. This *qi* of the multitude can only lift heavy objects, traverse great distances, or move the body; it cannot prolong life when retained, nor shorten it when expelled. Why, then, should one prohibit or restrict it?\n\nThe art of employing *qi* is merely the use of coarse *qi*, which can shift mountains, part rivers and seas, subdue tigers and leopards, and ward off bandits. Thus, the *qi* of the multitude is inferior to coarse *qi*, and coarse *qi* may be dispensed with, but the primordial *qi* must not be allowed to depart.\n\nTo preserve *qi* is to preserve the primordial *qi*, not the *qi* of the multitude or the coarse *qi*. When the primordial *qi* fills the viscera, coarse *qi* is naturally expelled, and one may move with coarse *qi* alone, without need of the *qi* of the multitude. Those who practice abstention fear the steaming of the five viscera by grain *qi*, hence their avoidance of it. Yet once one cultivates the art of *qi*, grain *qi* is naturally dispelled—even if one eats nine meals in a day, it cannot become harmful, and even if one fasts for an entire year, it cannot cause emaciation or distress. Thus, the Dao of *qi* is profound indeed!\n\nDaoist exercises do not depend on establishing names, imitating forms, adorning appearances, or depicting images in diagrams. They are nameless and formless—whether stretching or bending, bowing or raising, walking or lying, leaning or standing, pacing or strolling slowly, chanting or resting—all are Daoist exercises. One need not perform them every morning; whenever the body feels unwell, one may practice them. In all cases, one should hold the breath, for holding the breath causes the *qi* to surge and circulate.\n\nOne need not wait to count breaths; when the *qi* feels nearly exhausted, first draw in a small amount through the nose, then exhale through the mouth. Since the *qi* has been held for some time, it will surge against the throat. If one does not first draw in more *qi* before exhaling through the mouth, the *qi* will become coarse and injure the lungs.\n\nOne should cease the practice once the illness is cured, and not induce sweating, for sweat leaves one vulnerable to wind and agitation. When practicing Daoist exercises, the joints may produce sounds—great movements yield great sounds, while small movements yield small sounds—this is the relaxation of sinews and the circulation of *qi*.\n\nDaoist exercises treat illnesses before they arise and harmonize *qi* that is not at ease. When activated, the hundred passages flow smoothly; when held, the blood of the three palaces congeals. Truly, they are the great discipline of nurturing life and the wondrous art of dispelling illness.\n\n*Baopuzi Inner Chapters*, Scroll Four\n*From the Daoist Canon, Baopuzi Inner and Outer Chapters*\n\nFrom the *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*, *Baopuzi Outer Chapters*, Scroll One\n*Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty*\n\n**“Secluded Excellence”**\n\nThe Master Baopuzi said: There was one who cherished the Recluse of the Mound—he disdained the restless wandering of the worldly, lamented the bitter toil of grasping and spitting forth, and relinquished lofty aspirations in the land of rivers and seas. Thus he tilled the soil himself upon the saline-alkali flats, concealing the six stratagems within his breast like a sealed sack, harboring jade-like brilliance yet never revealing it. His pure voice went unheard, his radiant artistry unseen by the world. He turned his back on the morning splendor of vermilion gates, preserving tranquility within his thatched hut, cutting off all ties with the golden halls of the Jin and Zhang clans, and nurturing his vast *qi* among the company of secluded worthies. He deemed glory and eminence misfortune, and jade and silk no more than grass and earth. His spirit soared beyond the clouds, defying decrees to embrace the ways of high antiquity. Sheltered by the towering peaks of lofty mountains, he rested upon the fragrant mat of orchids and thoroughwort, rinsed his mouth with the limpid essence of rosy clouds, and ingested the refined essence of the eight minerals. His thoughts were as boundless as if dwelling at the edge of the rainbow, his intent as ethereal as if abiding in the realm of inverted shadows. The myriad things could not disturb his harmony; the four seas were insufficient to agitate his spirit.\n\nThereupon, the scion of the Qi clan, moved by this, sighed in lament: “That a steed of unmatched stature should dwell in an empty valley is a disgrace to Sun Yang. That a talent of surpassing brilliance should be left behind in times of peace is the fault of those who recognize true worth. How can we allow such an outstanding man to preserve his solitary integrity, thereby depriving the sagely court of his presence?”\n\nWould the virtue of the great Yu and the wisdom of the Duke of Zhou ever find their use? Thereupon, he approached and expounded:\n\n“Merely to hear of one who flaps his wings and tenses his frame yet cannot soar through the nine skies, who plods toward the farthest reaches of the empyrean yet merely orders the common norms—such a one is no hero of towering stature. Now, sir, you wield resolute judgment as if grasping a gleaming blade, and your writings, resplendent as brocade, surpass even the rarest of texts. Your ornate phrases rival the flocks of birds and beasts, your dragon-like patterns emerge in the darkest night, your treasures of jade and coral lie hidden in the abyss, you lie dormant in the height of summer, and conceal your brilliance in the midst of spring. Though you lower your curtain to delve deep in thought, exhaust your brush in florid prose, subtly elucidate the Supreme Ultimate, and expound the primordial origin—when your words bring joy, even wooden effigies smile; when they bring sorrow, even clay figures weep bitterly. Yet if you weigh lightly, you are like a swan’s feather sinking in the Weak Waters; if you bear heavily, you are like jade and stone swept away by raging waves. In separation, even liver and gall become as distant as Hu and Yue; in union, the myriad differences merge into one harmony. In incisive discourse, you are as stern as autumn frost; in gentle speech, as tender as ice melting into blossoms. When you topple the lofty, even the highest peaks crumble; when you elevate the lowly, even the deepest pools rise in grandeur. Sheltering the pure, you lean upon the outer light of darkness; purifying the turbid, you instantly clarify the Yellow River.\n\nYet you cannot bestow great kindness upon the common folk, nor inscribe illustrious merit in the annals of the imperial house. Your name will vanish like morning dew, your body will dissolve like the ephemeral mayfly. In an instant, you may be exalted to the treasure of sages, yet forget the fleeting passage of time, lamenting the approach of old age. Such a path is not one you should choose.\n\nI have heard that the greatest are Heaven and Earth, next are ruler and minister, and the former sages, grieving for their times, sought to enact the Dao, restless even three months without a lord. Now, our sagely sovereign is of one mind with Yao and Shun, pitying the common people so that every household may be enfeoffed. Thus, some bear the tripod and ascend like dragons, others strike their horns and sing like phoenixes—no need to await the rush-wheeled carriage before acting, no need to wait for King Wen before rising. From the outset, the Five Phases wax and wane with the seasons. In advancement, there is the benefit of a clear path; in retreat, no entanglement like a wet fox’s tail. The wise preserve themselves, while those who propagate transformation succor the common folk. Let them follow the orchid’s fragrance and bend its stem, bathe in the limpid waves to dispel sorrow—like Shen Jing responding to the bright mirror, or the square and round conforming to compass and rule. Thus, merit reaches above and below, and grace extends to the eight directions. This is why the Tang dynasty stood so majestic, why Chonghua ruled with reverence, why the Lord of the West divided the realm, why King Fa revolutionized the age, why Huan and Wen unified the land, and why Gaozu of Han answered Heaven’s call. Never has there been a time when the gathering of worthies did not serve as the six pinions, or the reliance on heroes did not serve as the boat and oars.\n\nIf each were to cling to the loftiness of those who ‘wash their ears,’ or hold to the role of the plowman, then the transformative teachings of antiquity would not be established, the splendor of enlightened governance would not shine forth, the songs of wise rulers and good ministers would not be composed, and the vast net of Heaven would not be cast. Therefore, those who conceal their talents value adaptability; those who excel in seclusion prize the revelation of their uniqueness. In times of chaos, to hide one’s radiance and obscure one’s light in the clouds is to leave the brilliance of Heaven unmanifest; to sheathe the tiger’s fangs and grasp its horns is to leave its power to rend and tear unexpressed. If the great sword Tai’e lies hidden and unstruck, its decisive might remains unseen. If the swift Lü’er keeps its hooves still and does not gallop, its wind-chasing speed remains unapparent. To remain silent is to be no different from Zigong when mute; to close one’s eyes is to be no different from Li Zhu when blind.\n\nSir, you purify yourself yet overlook the disorder of the great moral order; you find contentment yet forget the duty to bring peace to those above. You remain bound by the mechanism of existence, yet leave no enduring name like metal or stone. Even the common man would flush with indignation—how could a man of true refinement remain indifferent?\n\nWhen the carpenter’s line is applied, the wood straightens; when Zheng music advances, the elegant withers. When Youyu was raised, the four evils were executed; when Confucius entered, the young Shaoyu was vanquished. The thunderous drum startles even the owl; when the sun rises, the firefly’s glow fades into obscurity. If you do not rescue those afflicted by the ‘summoning of souls,’ how can you display the extraordinary skill of the physician of Yue? If you do not aid a world beset by calamities, how can you reveal your uncommon and far-reaching capacity?\n\nTo sit in lofty repose and watch others drown is not the way of one who aids the world; to hold the Dao yet mislead the state is not the task of a true leader. If you wait for the grasses of mid-Tang to sprout in the morning sun, or the phoenix’s song to resound at dawn, if you await the solitary-horned beast to stand in the suburbs or the interlinked trees to cluster in the wild, then the long banners will remain furled, the weapons of war will stay sheathed, and Shaobo will retire from his achievements—who then will lift you up?\n\nAlas, how deeply you have sunk! I earnestly hope, sir, that you will not delay, but swiftly return.”\n\nThus, Master Huai-Bing gazed afar in serene detachment, his spirit roaming the celestial thoroughfares, his emotions and thoughts drifting into boundless distance—seeming as though nothing existed beside him. He lowered his gaze and replied:\n\nAlas, have such words truly been spoken? The perfected person acts through non-action, dwelling in the void of the spirit, never enslaving their will to emolument or gain. Thus, harm and humiliation cannot touch them. They do not hesitate on perilous paths, so stumbling and downfall cannot become their affliction. Though coarse greens fail to suffice, their mind finds ease in a feast of a hundred delicacies; though they rank among the common and the lowly, their heart rejoices as if they ruled a kingdom. They sleep in the huts of Yi Liao, close the gates of Gan Mu, befriend Zhuangzi and Liezi, and dwell in humble lanes—steadfast as a mountain, unshaken. How could they harbor any concern for expansion or withdrawal?\n\nDesire, when broadened, muddies harmony, so they relinquish worldly affairs without entanglement. Those at the pinnacle of rank bear profound anxieties, so they turn from power and profit without lingering doubt. Their nobility does not depend on titles, their wealth does not rely on riches. They companion with clouds and roc-birds in lofty flight, never entangling their wings in the stench of rotting rats. They find true abundance in frequent emptiness, never altering their joy in a simple gourd and bamboo bowl.\n\nMoreover, the Way of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi stretches into the distant past, yet human life flashes by like a white colt glimpsed through a crack—swift as a shooting star’s fleeting appearance, fleeting as a flying arrow’s lightning passage. Why not roam freely in self-contentment? How could one torment the body for the sake of external things?\n\nThe kite does not entangle itself in nets; the unicorn does not fall into traps. Even birds and beasts know to avoid peril—how can those who wander in the dust fail to take heed? Consider Yao Li, who destroyed his family to render service; Ji Xin, who rose in flames to deceive Chu; Chen Jia, who slit his throat to prove his brother’s loyalty; Zhong You, who threw away his life to fulfill a pledge; Ying Men, who fell on his sword to lose his mind; Nie Zheng, who was moved by a zither’s lament to slaughter a lord; Jing Ke, who severed his shin to repay Yan and Chu; and Gong Han, who received a severed head in grief. All were the mad delusions of the profoundly foolish—how could the supremely wise ever choose such paths?\n\nThose with generous stipends bear heavy responsibilities; those with exalted rank endure mental toil. Thus, Zhuangzi fished with his line and ignored the honor of ministerial office; Bo Yi plowed with his plowshare and disdained the loftiness of feudal lords. Yang Zhu found peace in the butcher’s stall; the petty seekers of advantage remain blind to what is truly desirable. They gather without choosing the right tree; they serve without assessing the times. Greedily advancing, they do not consider the disaster of overreaching; accepting office, they do not weigh their inability to bear the burden. When discussing honor and nobility, they invoke Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou to save the drowning; when speaking of the perils of overreaching, they conceal the overturned tripod and refuse to remember. They watch for the river dragon to sleep so they may pluck its luminous pearl; they bask in the favor of the imperial measure, hoping for freedom from calamity. They indulge in the fleeting comfort of the water clock, blind to the inevitable danger. They covet the ephemeral glory of the morning mushroom, yet aspire to the longevity of the great tree. It is like treading thin ice in anticipation of summer’s heat, or climbing a rotten branch in expectation of a fierce wind. The deep-sea fish is lured by fragrant bait; the marsh pheasant swallows poisonous grain. They chew spoiled meat to fill their hunger, and guzzle poisoned wine to quench their thirst.\n\nIn ancient times, when Jizi saw ivory chopsticks, he wept; when Confucius heard the sound of an ominous bell, he sighed deeply. For they traced the beginnings to foresee the ends, and thus knew what was to come. Yet how can those who blindly step into the trap perceive what lies ahead? How can the allure of profit and desire grow ever more intense?\n\nKing Cheng of Zhou was virtuous, yet believed slander; the Duke of Zhou was sagely, yet fled to the southern lands of Chu. He entrusted his lament to the owl’s cry and barely escaped through the sealed golden casket. If even such enlightened rulers, who appear but once in an age, could face displeasure and slander at any moment, how much more so for others? Virtue does not rise like a violent wind to revive withered grain; affairs do not become weighty merely by bearing jade tablets. Alas, tears and lamentations come too late—how could it be otherwise?\n\nWhen gradual infiltration persists, even the strongest glue and lacquer dissolve; when prolonged soaking continues, even bone and flesh grow estranged. The accumulation of dust and feathers sinks ships and snaps axles; the repetition of slanderous words turns rumors into tigers. Jiang Chong, though base, was not kin to the crown prince; the stepmother, though a mere successor, was not close to Bo Qi. Yet the false accusation of digging up roots destroyed the bond of father and son; the deception of a singing cricket shattered the love of natural affection. How much less can one be certain of others?\n\nAlas, Wu Yun remained loyal yet his corpse drifted in the river; Bai Qi upheld righteousness yet slit his own throat. For when one sees through to the core, the heart grows cold—how could even a master craftsman not be confounded?\n\nMoreover, I would seek to extend my meager talents to echo the crowd, relying on my solitary correctness to reprove the many. Yet if I do not see that though metal can overcome wood, an awl cannot fell the forest of Deng; though water can conquer fire, a ladleful cannot extinguish a mountain ablaze; a drop of glue cannot clarify the Yellow River’s turbidity; a sliver of ice cannot cool the scorching heat of Xiao Qiu—then how can I not know that those who preserve both body and name are exceedingly rare, while those who first rejoice and later wail are many?\n\nTo fear the perils of overreaching yet not extinguish the desire for glory; to dread disgrace yet not dispel the impulse to contend—is like fearing dampness yet swimming in the deep abyss, hating one’s shadow yet avoiding all shade, drilling a hole in the boat to stop a leak, or adding fuel to quell boiling. The seven-foot frame is the vessel of life—one cannot return it maimed. The heart within the breast is governed by oneself—one cannot let it drift into dissipation.\n\nPlow the fields to eat; dig a well to drink. Wear coarse cloth to cover yourself; dwell in a humble hut for shelter. Sing and recite for joy; breathe deeply to prolong life. Roam freely among bamboo and silk; entrust your feelings to the brush of the Dao. Maintain constancy and await the end—this is enough.\n\nMoreover, when the Dao is present, one is exalted; when virtue prevails, one is noble. To cast aside a luminous pearl to shoot a sparrow—only a fool would do such a thing. Why must one seek prominence through power or wait for stipends to be sated?\n\nThose who are content in poverty consider the absence of wealth as riches; those who delight in humility regard not serving as honor. Thus, Ruan Ji floated on the sea to purify his spirit; Huzi was content to retire and plow. Pang Degong suffered punishment for his virtue; Xin and Wu were ensnared by charges of great merit. A single branch suffices to shelter the phoenix’s feathers—why need a vast forest? A shallow pool is enough to float the dragon’s scales—why require the deep sea? Coarse greens surpass the eight delicacies; a cold spring surpasses fine wine. Straw sandals outshine red shoes; a patched robe rivals imperial robes. Clasping one’s hands brings more ease than leaning on a staff; the rustling of branches brings more joy than strings and bamboo. A thatched cottage outshines vermilion pillars; uncarved rafters are more precious than ornate beams. Ascending Song Peak as one’s terrace; sheltering beneath a rocky overhang as one’s mansion. Accumulating writings as one’s granary; treasuring discourse on the Dao as gold and jade. Abandon the petty attachments of ordinary men; diminish the desires of the mediocre. Roam the nine marshes in joy; dispel worldly wisdom to transcend the vulgar. Like the inchworm, conceal your light; uphold simplicity and display clumsiness. Know when to stop and be content. Then, savor the fragrance of magic mushrooms; let your spirit soar with the floating clouds. Bask in the radiance of the nine suns; attach your wings to the lofty parasol tree. Look down to gather on the sacred isles—how could this compare to driving a chariot and crouching in the mud, or being draped in embroidered robes like an ox at sacrifice?\n\nLord Qi Shi declared: To enter but never emerge is to be mired in favor and forget retreat; to depart but never return is to abandon office without righteousness. Thus the enlightened, knowing the body is not their own possession, entrust themselves to circumstance. Whether rising in prominence or dwelling in obscurity, whether speaking or silent, they hold nothing as fixed. When silk bundles fill the courtyard and torchlight blazes in the hall, the noble man’s Dao prevails. When fortune smiles like the sun at midday, they act. But when the age is plunged into the misfortunes of yang’s ninth phase, when slander triumphs, they do not step beyond their gate, sealing their mouths like a tied sack—useless. Dragons rise and phoenixes retreat, adapting to the times. This is why the ancients sometimes fled peril and chaos, refusing to enter, or took flight at the first sign of danger, not lingering even a day: they feared the fire on Mount Wu might consume orchid and mugwort alike.\n\nNow the sagely emperor governs the age, the world is level and the Dao at peace. Benevolence extends to all living things, his virtuous influence spreads far and wide, his awe-inspiring might reaches the four quarters. The nine realms are drenched in his grace; his earthly virtue bears all things with profound capacity. He solidifies the celestial vault with towering majesty. In divine transformation, clouds drift and rain descends; in mystical beneficence, primordial qi swells boundlessly. The four gates stand solemn and vast, welcoming all; the sovereign’s thought embraces the heroic and free, fostering good governance. This is a rare opportunity, a once-in-a-millennium turning point—and yet you, sir, cling to the lopsided path of reclusion, blind to the perils of excessive restraint.\n\nYou focus solely on cultivating inner strength like Shan Bao, never considering the threat of a tiger’s assault from without.\n\nShould one hear of a man drowning while fording a stream and thus declare all boats doomed to fail, or witness the treachery of Shang Chen and conclude that no heir to the throne is trustworthy—such reasoning is flawed. Master Huai-bing replied: “The flourishing of sagely transformation truly accords with your lofty discourse, yet the matter of withdrawal or engagement is a matter of individual inclination. When Yao and Shun reigned above, the Jishan and Yingyin valleys still sheltered recluses who dwelt in nests; when the Xia sovereigns governed the age, the remote gorges harbored worthies who grasped their ploughs. Did they truly fear such dangers? No—each simply followed what brought them peace.\n\nThus, one may exalt his resolve and refuse to serve kings and marquises, upholding the hexagrams’ symbols as a common man’s duty. Yan Zhou preserved his integrity, and the sages approved. As for me, I wander carefree among hills and gardens, withdrawing my traces to the wilds. My choice stems from this truth: my talents are not those of a statesman, and I lack the capacity to govern the people. Now, when a host of scholars arises like clouds, when the eminent and wise gather like scales, when the halls are filled with civil and martial worthies, and all affairs are at peace—why should I seek to cast my flickering light among the sun and moon, or strike a earthen jar beside a mighty bell? To offer a light fan in the season of solid ice, or a fur coat in the height of summer, would only hasten ridicule for untimely uselessness.\n\nYet if I devote myself to studying the classics and composing writings, I may preserve my authenticity, establish my name, and benefit the later age. If I force myself into what I cannot bear, I shall only stumble and fall, inviting blame and regret. Thus, like the little fox, I dwell in my strengths to safeguard my weaknesses. Though I possess no merits from serving at court nor toils from campaigning at the frontier, I still refine the young, cultivate the Dao, and nurture governance—different paths leading to the same end. I am no rigidly aloof man.\n\nEven the humblest may preserve his single integrity—how could I compare to Xu You? In this sagely age, tolerance is extended, and I am granted the same latitude as the recluses of the Tang. Is this not enough? Prince Qishi, suddenly abashed, composed himself and changed his expression, saying: “Sir, your words uphold teaching and aid instruction; your prose exposes deceit and resists perversion. You champion quietude to curb the restless competition of the age, and revive Confucian learning to mend the broken thread of discourse. Who but a man of emergence could order the constant norms? Who but a dragon could instruct the young? Under heaven, all are subjects—must only those who wear court caps and hold tablets be deemed right, while those who delight in hunger at rustic gates be deemed wrong?\n\nAre the masses not lost in delusion? Those wandering the vastness of Yunmeng must rely on the Southern Pointer to know the Way; those adrift on the boundless sea must gaze upon the North Star to find their return. Now, having heard your noble instruction, I perceive my blindness. I shall don my robes and cap, take up my humble steed, and aspire to the raft of universal love, advancing without prejudice in my choices.”\n\n**The Recluse, Part Two**\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: “In times past, I wandered...”\n\nOn Cloud Terrace Mountain, I encountered a recluse and found an official in his presence. The official declared: “With radiant clarity above, the sovereign governs the Eight Extremes, uniting Hua and Yi in common allegiance, while distant lands offer tribute. Yet you, sir, roam the remote wilds of cypress and pine, forsaking the martial and virtuous, abandoning the multitudes like birds scattering. Times change, customs shift, and worldly affairs no longer bind—yet those who eat bark and dwell in mountains, casting off external burdens, were once deemed pure and lofty, while now they are but fugitives in flight.\n\n“The noble man perceives danger before it takes shape and severs calamity at its inception. Is it not so that one avoids the inner peril of Zhang Yi, yet grows complacent in the outer harm of Shan Bao? Fearful of fullness, he resists contemplation; unmindful of the chaos near at hand, he shuns the shallow perils of ox tracks only to plunge into the unfathomable blades of a hundred knives. He flees the muddy shallows where feet may wet, yet casts himself into the furnace’s fire, all unawares.”\n\nThe recluse replied: “He who sharpens his resolve on fledgling mice knows not the purpose of the *zōuyú*; he who triumphs in gleaning courtyard grains cannot fathom the distant aim of the phoenix and simurgh. Like the scorched cicada mocking the cloud-soaring *peng*, or the morning mushroom marveling at the great *chun* tree; like the pit-frog doubting the sea or the snake deriding the dragon—such is your joy and fear in urging or dissuading.\n\n“Ah, do you truly grasp the lofty rhythm of the profound and vast?”\n\n“Fortunate am I to have been born in the age of Yao and Shun—what worry have I that I may not attain this man’s resolve?\n\nThe official replied: ‘Of old, the proud and aloof Hua Shi refused to contend for rank, dwelling beyond the sea’s edge, yet the Grand Duke executed him. Is not your seclusion, sir, perilous indeed?’\n\nThe recluse answered: ‘Lu Shang excelled in waging war but fell short in governing the state. He could not emulate the profound Yellow Emperor, whose virtue embraced heaven and earth, nor match the vastness of the seas and mountains in honoring worthies and esteeming virtue. Delighting in nurturing talent, he yet took pleasure in execution, neglecting benevolence and righteousness. Thus, the calamity of his slaughter took root from the moment of his enfeoffment. When the Duke of Zhou heard of this, he knew his state would not endure.\n\n‘For attack and defense demand different dispositions; the Dao prizes adaptability. Yet Lu Shang lacked the art of boiling scales to draw forth distant steeds, nor did he possess the reins to guide far-reaching governance. He thrust forward the tactics of battle arrays, loathing those of lofty integrity—relying on armor to perfect his blades, and further, on swimming to shoot fleeing foes. Could he truly have hoped to aim at the mark with such measures?\n\n‘Tilt the nest of common birds, and the numinous phoenix will not alight; drain the pool of fish and turtles, and the divine dragon will flee afar. Rip open the wombs of ordinary beasts, and the qilin will not stand in their fields. Harm even a single scholar, and the heroic will not tread your land. Lu Shang founded a dynasty and bequeathed its legacy to posterity, yet he unfurled the banner of harsh cruelty, unsealed the casket of savagery—just enough to drive the talented to serve other states, to chase away the worthy and leave them to enemy hands.\n\n‘How far removed is this from those who bought the bones of a dead steed to attract swift hooves, or bowed in humble lanes to repel Qin’s armies! What say you, sir—how does Lu Shang compare to the Duke of Zhou?’\n\nThe scholar replied: ‘I cannot judge.’\n\nThe recluse said: ‘The Duke of Zhou, a great sage, humbled himself before the lowly: he would spit out his food and grasp his hair, fearing to lose men. From thatched huts, seventy scholars came; from among commoners, he took disciples, ten of whom he treated as teachers, twelve as friends—all drawn to court by his gravity.\n\n‘Had Lu Shang occupied the Duke of Zhou’s place, these men would have become corpses strewn in the marketplace, carcasses rotting in ditches. Yao could have compelled Xu You and Chao Fu to serve; Shun could have coerced Shan Juan and the men of Stone Gate; Yu could have forced Bo Chengzi Gao; Tang could have pressed Bian Sui and Wu Guang; King Wen of Wei could have bent Gan Mu; and Duke Ping of Jin could have pressed Hai Tang. Yet they honored and set them free, esteemed and held them in weight—not because the six rulers were weak, but because the hundred virtues differ in their heights, and silence is hard to equal.\n\n‘They admired the beauty of honoring worthies, shamed the ugliness of harming the good. To employ such men would not have increased their might; to cast them aside would not have left their offices empty. Following their resolve could spread refined customs and foster flourishing virtue, spurring the greedy to withdraw and shaming the reckless. Though their talents might not suffice for immediate use or match the finest at court, was this not better than cringing and fawning, flattering the powerful, clutching gifts and bearing bribes, racing through the night to vie for favor, scrambling for passage, trading in fame, discarding virtue and conduct for the root of literary learning, or rushing to join the clamor of partisan factions?\n\n‘If even those six rulers would not press their words upon reclusive scholars, would they have resorted to the blade? The sages are truly worthy of emulation—Lu Shang was clearly in error.\n\n‘Though Emperor Gao of Han had many flaws in his conduct and little acquaintance with the classics, his magnanimity was vast, his tolerance boundless. He did not press the Four Elders of Mount Shang, though he hungered and thirsted for them. Only when the crown prince humbled himself to invite them did he make them his wings. He revered virtue, restrained his emotions, mourned the yellow swan with a sorrowful song, and thwarted his concubines’ ambitions. Such was his esteem for worthies—no wonder he rose from commoner to rule the realm. His capacity surpassed others indeed.\n\n‘As for Lu Shang’s execution of Hua Shi, it was out of fear that he would discourage the masses. Yet the true affliction of the age—does it lie in this?’”\n\nThose who hasten forward in pursuit of office neglect their conduct and calling—yet the true affliction of the age is not the abundance of those content with poverty and humble station. Suppose worthies often fix their gaze upon such men: those whose hearts cling to power and profit, whose ambitions know no limit, can never sever these habitual desires to admire those who withdraw in quietude. Since the dawn of time, they have been many, yet those who forget wealth and forsake rank remain fewer than one in ten thousand.\n\nConfucius himself studied under Laozi yet could not cultivate his nonaction; Zigong and Yuan Xian were fellow disciples yet could not emulate his purity and austerity. The Four Hermits of Mount Shang lived in the same age as Chao Fu and Xu You, yet Wang Mang shared his era with the two Gong brothers—none could follow their example. Even if the common folk were flogged and shamed, forced to pursue the likes of Hua Shi, they would still refuse. How, then, could Lu Shang fear that Hua Shi would corrupt the masses? Failing to grasp this, he applied military law to a time of peace, wrongfully harming a worthy—his cruelty was grievous indeed. Only his great achievements prevented his downfall.\n\nMoreover, before Lu Shang met King Wen, he too endured poverty and lowliness. The common crowd despised him; an old woman drove him away. His hired labor went unsold; his butchery and angling brought no gain. Not a single soul admired him. In his reclusion, why did he alone fear that Hua Shi would discourage the masses? Had King Zhou of Yin fled and sought refuge, would Lu Shang, even at the point of death, have called it a crime? Cao Cao, too, enforced harsh laws and was swift to kill, yet in his heart he sought to employ Kongming. Kongming plainly declared he had no wish to serve, and Cao Cao dismissed him, saying, “It would be wrong to humiliate a man of lofty character in the court of a corrupt ruler.” Though Cao Cao lashed the Nine Provinces and laid the foundations of an empire, he did not act recklessly.\n\nYet as turmoil persisted and competition became custom, some thrust themselves forward with bribes like dragons leaping, while others ascended through factional ties like phoenixes soaring. Wind shapes habit, and custom obscures the great Dao. Later generations, ignorant of the teachings of the Ru, came to believe that wealth alone could establish one’s person. When a man of outstanding integrity, who never leaves his home yet quietly savors the Dao, appears, should he not be sought out and honored to revive the virtue of humility?\n\nIf Sun Wu and Wu Qi bore arms, their strength was that of a single man, yet their strategies surpassed those of ten thousand. Now, if a great Ru were sent as an emissary—not to handle pressing affairs but to teach in the mountains and forests—could he not mold the young and expound the refined rites of reverence? Why must one harness a great elephant to catch a mouse or saddle a phoenix to ride? Then the bells and tripods would resound with his name. As for those who wither in the marshes and thickets, who live and die in vain—what worth do they hold?\n\nThe recluse replied: “You may be said to guard a molehill and play upon a fox mound, never having ascended the heights of Langfeng to gaze upon the clouds, nor floated upon the limpid shallows to cross the Milky Way. The so-called men of aspiration need not seek office, nor must they strive for merit and fame. The highest attain the nameless; the next, the unnameable. They soar on wings to surpass the crowd, their tracks vanish like a wheel’s hub—doing what ordinary men cannot, severing what those of mediocre talent cannot sever. Whether few or many, they are not measured by common standards. Serene and pure, they are unstained by fame or rank. Their pure influence is enough to cleanse the filth of a hundred generations; their lofty standards are enough to rouse the turbid men of later times. Why must they don crimson sashes and purple robes, wear crowns and ride carriages, adorn themselves with the embroidered hides of sacrificial oxen, or swallow the fragrant bait of Zhan He? One morning they blaze like the scorching sun, by evening they crumble into cold ashes.\n\nThe sparrow does not trade its thorny thicket for the distant clouds; the king salmon does not abandon its deep pool for the vastness of the sea. Tigers and leopards enter grand halls and grieve; swans and cranes ascend the peaks of Song and grow sorrowful. Each creature finds peace in what it excels at—none rejoices in success or mourns in loss. The men of the world, however, are all like this: a single day without a lord leaves them restless and anxious. They are like the jade piled in Lantian or the timber filling Deng Forest—though skilled craftsmen and great artisans may use them as they please, why must one drown fish or sink birds?\n\nNoble reclusion and lofty withdrawal were approved by the ancient sages. Some emerge, some withdraw—each follows his own inclination. What the scholar values is the establishment of virtue and the creation of teachings. To practice filial piety, friendship, benevolence, and righteousness, to maintain purity and loftiness—this is to establish virtue. To exhaustively study the ancient texts and produce writings of brilliance—this is to establish teachings.\n\nShanjuan had no merit in governing the people, yet he cannot be said to have diminished the customs of the age. Confucius had no achievements in warfare, yet he cannot be said to have fallen short of Han Xin or Bai Qi. To preserve both name and person intact is the highest worthiness; to dwell in reclusion and fulfill one’s aspirations surpasses even the ancients. Boyi and Shuqi, though inflexible in their principles, were praised by the ancients for not lowering their aspirations or humiliating themselves. Not lowering their aspirations shows they esteemed the loftiness of reclusion; not humiliating themselves shows they knew the defilement of bondage.\n\nThe purity of the sages was praised by Mencius, who also said that the heavenly nobility surpasses official seals. To cultivate one’s aspirations and forsake glory was esteemed by Xunzi. When the weight of the Dao and righteousness is recognized, kings and dukes may be held lightly. Yet what the world fears is power, what it values is profit. Those of great virtue who remain obscure are dismissed as mediocre; those of small capacity entrusted with great tasks are hailed as lofty scholars. Some risk danger, brave peril, cast aside their lives, and hurl their bodies beneath a thousand blades—all to seize glory and splendor in a single morning. Compared to those who scorn the four seas and cherish their own necks, how deluded they are!\n\nOne who serves the world says: ‘The reclusive scholar, content in the mountains and marshes, does not bear the world’s honors. Unfettered and unrestrained, he is of no use to his age. To covet rank and profit is truly a useless thing in the world.’ The recluse replied: ‘The unicorn does not bark, the phoenix does not herald the dawn, the celestial steed does not pull the plow, and the ancestral priest does not manage the kitchen. Moreover, the sun shines with great brightness, illuminating all without exception, while the nurturing warmth of the gentle wind is the work of the moon.’”\n\nThe radiance of lamps on a quiet night, the smelting of metal and stone for practical use—these are the work of fire. The world cannot endure for long without the sun, nor can it last a single day without fire, yet their magnitudes cannot be equated.\n\nBeyond the rivers and seas, the vastness of heaven and earth unfolds: rising as clouds and rain, descending to form the hundred streams. Yet the daily use of these great waters does not match the irrigation of a well’s shallow blade, nor does the flooding of fields and gardens compare to the nourishment of a humble ditch. Which, then, is truly vast?\n\nJie and Zhou were emperors, while Confucius was but a minister’s minister. Yet when men are likened to Jie and Zhou, none fail to rage, while to be compared to Confucius brings universal delight. Thus, nobility and baseness do not lie in rank alone.\n\nMencius said: “Were Yu, Ji, and Yan Yuan to exchange places, they would all act the same.” Zai Yu also declared Confucius far greater than Yao and Shun. If commoners and kings are weighed equally, and scholars exalted above all, then the virtue of the Tang and Yu dynasties was virtue alone—what need had it for office?\n\nMoreover, when the sun’s brilliance ascends through creation, turning heaven and earth within its embrace, the mind remains vast and unburdened by worldly affairs. When the pure and white is untouched by glory or disgrace, the desires of the vulgar cannot gladden the spirit, nor can the confusions of the crowd sway one’s resolve. Glory and splendor are but growths to be excised, and the ten thousand things no more than the wings of a cicada.\n\nWould one of such disposition deign to bend his limbs, bow his bearing, and measure his conduct by what displeases him? Would he labor over what he has cast aside, force a smile to advance, or cringe to retreat—fearing the displeasure of the vulgar or the wear of his own body? Would he dull the Dragon Spring sword into an awl, mute the sacred drum into a child’s toy, wield the Yellow Thearch’s scepter as a sickle, or lower the imperial banner beneath the branches of the scholar’s tree?\n\nKing Gu of old cast aside his staff and fled, while Yu Yi entered a cave to escape. Ji Zha withdrew to till the fields, and Lao Lai irrigated gardens to keep his distance. Each followed his own inclinations—none would trade their way.\n\nThus, purity untainted is true wealth, and a body free from servitude is true nobility.\n\nShould one cleave the tally and hold land, what is called emolument and gain is but a semblance—no true wealth or nobility. Moreover, the higher the office, the heavier the burden; the greater the merit, the more men envy it. Only in poverty and lowliness does none contend with me, allowing one to treasure it long and live without care.\n\nTo wash one’s furs and mend coarse cloth, to tend mallows and discard weaving, to leave beans uncovered and dine on rough grain—this may invite the scorn of those who fawn and dissemble. Yet to erect screens and seal off chambers, to feast on three returns of jade-laden dishes and the luxuries of marquises, to bask in the ease of Anchang—this brings the burden of usurping rank and wallowing in filth. Better to wander in the canon of the spirit, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, seeking only to fill the belly. At the tip of the plowshare or amidst the threads of the loom, one gazes at the river and is sated; the body gathers to a single branch and rests in abundance. The teeming ten thousand things crumble into dust and ash.\n\nGruel to fill the mouth, hempen robes and patched gowns—such plainness frees the will, neither sorrow nor joy. This is true honor and joy, likened to having nothing at all.\n\nAs for office: if one seeks a name, then inscribing a hair suffices to bear one’s surname—why rely on the good historian or the engraving of tripods? Mencius did not count arrows and stones as merit; Yang Yun did not seek to enrich the age by governing the people. To seek benevolence and attain it—is this not enough?\n\nYet the official says: “Those who flee the world are disloyal; how can they dwell in the ruler’s land and eat the ruler’s grain?” The recluse replies: “What do you mean? When Yan Hui died, Duke Ding of Lu was to offer condolences in person. He sent someone to consult Confucius, who said: ‘All within the seas are subjects.’ Duke Ding then ascended by the eastern steps and performed the rites of a lord. By this reasoning, all within the shores are the king’s subjects—this much is clear. Those at court exert their strength to serve; those in the mountains and forests follow virtue to curb greed. Though the paths of purity and turbidity differ, their return is the same: all are subjects. The king knows no bounds; the world is his home. Where the sun and moon shine, where rain and dew fall—all is his domain. How can one suspend oneself in empty space, feed on sips of rosy clouds, and refuse to dwell within it? Does the earth not feed? Does the grain not grow?”\n\nThe gold and jade of mountains, the pearls and cowries of waters—though not stored in the treasury nor used for daily court needs—are still the ruler’s wealth. Reclusive scholars, not ranked among meat-eating officials, are like the treasures of mountains and waters. Are they not also possessions of the state? Xu You did not flee beyond the four seas; the Four Hoary Ones did not escape to the farthest wilds. Thus it is said: “All within the realm, from the noble to the humble, are the emperor’s subjects.” Gan Mu did not bear arms to guard the frontier or build ramparts on the battlefield, yet he rendered the service of strengthening Wei. Now, those who dwell in reed huts within the realm, chanting the Way of the former kings, teach the people the virtue of yielding—if Confucian and Mohist teachings do not decline, this too is what Yao and Shun would approve.\n\nIn the past, Boyi and Shuqi refused to eat Zhou grain, and Bao Jiao starved to death beneath a bridge—how can their stubbornness serve as a model? Formerly, Emperor An sent dark silk and jade to summon Zhou Yanzu; Emperor Huan sent dark silk and jade to summon Wei Xiuming; Emperor Shun sent dark silk and jade to summon Yang Zhongxuan. Each accepted the appointment as Attendant Gentleman but did not take office. Emperor Wen of Wei summoned Guan You’an, who also refused. He then decreed that local authorities annually provide one sheep and two *hu* of wine. Emperor Huan sent dark silk and jade to summon Xu Shuzi, who accepted the post of Governor of Taiyuan and Minister of the East Sea but did not assume office. Emperor Shun sent dark silk and jade to summon Fan Jigao, who declined, prompting the decree that local authorities annually provide one sheep and two *hu* of wine, along with a ceremonial desk and staff, treating him with the rites due a teacher. In Emperor Xian’s time, Zheng Kangcheng was nominated by the province as Filial and Incorrupt, Outstanding Talent, and Excellent and Upright, and summoned fourteen times by the Three Ducal Ministers—all of which he declined. The imperial carriage summoned him as Gentleman Consultant, Erudite, Minister of the Capital, Attendant Gentleman, and Grand Minister of Agriculture—none of which he accepted. Emperor Zhao’s imperial carriage summoned Han Fu, who arrived and was granted fifty bolts of silk, along with sheep and wine. Fa Gaoqing was twice nominated as Filial and Incorrupt, five times summoned by his province, eight times by the Three Ducal Ministers, nine times as Excellent and Upright, and three times as Erudite—all of which he declined. Emperor Huan sent dark silk, jade, a covered carriage, and a light chariot to summon Han Boxiu, who did not come; he sent the same to summon Jiang Boya, who accepted the post of Palace Grandee but declined the governorship of Fang—yet all were treated with esteem and not subjected to coercive summons.\n\nIf these emperors’ commendation of reclusive scholars was not misguided, then the execution of Hua Shi by Lü Shang was excessively harsh and cruel—this much is clear. The official, thus dismayed, lost himself in reflection and sighed deeply, saying: “Now I realize the principle of transcending the common—it is not something the mediocre and petty can perceive.”\n\n**Exhortation to Study (III)**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: Study is the means to clarify and settle the nature and principle of the mind, to winnow away the dust and grime, to carve and polish the unrefined ore, to sharpen the dull blade, to awaken the Dao and brighten the intellect, to adorn and dye the plain silk, to examine the past and foresee the future, to range widely and encourage achievement, to look up and observe, to look down and scrutinize—all of which lie within the purview of the kingly Way. Advancing, one may govern the state; retreating, one may preserve oneself. Thus, the sages and worthies were all untiring in their diligence, striving day and night without cease, studying until the water-clock ran dry and the sun stood at noon without laying aside their books, enduring hunger and cold, peril and hardship without abandoning their pursuit. How could this be for the sake of seeking favor in the present age? Truly, it is the natural joy of the endeavor itself.\n\nThe shallow skills of carving and engraving, the easy arts of archery and charioteering, still require habitual practice before one can master them—how much more so the vastness of human principles, the profundity of the Dao and virtue, the transformations of yin and yang, and the subtleties of spirits and gods, distant and obscure, dark and recondite, truly difficult to comprehend! Though one may say a color is white, without dyeing it will not be lustrous; though one may say a taste is sweet, without blending it will not be savory. Thus, the jade flower, if left unpolished, will not emit its radiance by night; the crimson blade, if left untempered, will not achieve the strength of the pure steel sword. Fire, if not drilled, will not ignite; if not fanned, will not blaze. Water, if not channeled, will not flow; if not accumulated, will not run deep. Though the raw material lies within me, its completion depends on external means.\n\nOnly by ascending the Towering Wind and grasping the Pillar of Dawn does one realize the gloom and narrowness of the well and valley. Only by perusing the Six Classics and savoring the Hundred Schools does one perceive the utter blindness of facing a wall. To seek knowledge without study is like desiring fish without a net—though the mind may toil, there will be no harvest. To pursue breadth and exhaust principle is like entrusting oneself to a following wind—without bodily labor, one may reach far.\n\nCosmetics, when applied, enhance the beauty of Xi Shi and conceal the ugliness of the wen; profound learning in the classics, when deep, allows the brilliant to soar freely and the dull to awaken. The catalpa and nanmu may soar to the clouds, yet without the craft of Lu Ban, they cannot become towers and pavilions. A man may be naturally bright and clear, yet without understanding the right and wrong of great principles, he cannot be called a gentleman.\n\nTo surpass a thousand *li* in a single morning, one must rely on the swiftness of Retreat Shadow’s steed. To cross the vast waves and reach distant shores, one must depend on the vessel and oars. To see beyond all bounds without descending from the hall, one must turn to the written records. To fathom the depths of the abyss without exhausting the spirit, one must find a luminous teacher. Thus, cinnabar and verdigris transform plain silk; instruction dispels ignorance. When one parts the dark clouds and raises the great light, the forms of the ten thousand things are revealed without concealment. When one unfurls the bamboo and silk and examines past and present, the secrets of heaven and earth are laid bare—how much more so the workings of spirits and gods, and even more, the affairs of men!\n\nCan mud be made as hard as lacquer? Can gold, jade, or crooked wood be worked to meet the carpenter’s square? Can the hundred beasts be trained for battle formations? Can the six livestock be taught to advance and retreat? Can deep-swimming fish be moved by sound? Can inanimate stones be stirred by sincerity? How much more so for those who bear the Five Constants and are endowed with the most refined spirit?\n\nThe lowly and high-stepping steeds are shaped by training; birds of prey are tamed by practice. Though common horses and wild hawks share the same nature, one is adorned and prized while the other remains coarse and base. If one persists in navigating the shallows without ceasing, one will surely merge with the vast sea. If one adds but a single basket of earth without rest, one will surely reach the towering summit.\n\nWhen great rivers surge, dragons and serpents swim in schools; as days pass and months progress, virtue is established and the Dao perfected—then one may rest in the dreams of the sages, and what need has one merely to break free from shackles? Alas, how grievous the plight of the benighted!\n\nIn former times, Zhong You wore a rooster’s crest and a sash adorned with chirping cicadas, brandished his sword, and danced with bared blade, boasting of the strength of Mount Tai’s bamboo, as if to rely on the natural vigor of the unyielding. Yet Confucius, with gentle guidance, infused him with moral instruction, and thus nurtured a disciple who ascended the hall and ranked among the four sages. Zhang Liang, though once a coarse man who gathered ruffians, was gradually steeped in the Dao’s teachings and transformed into a renowned scholar, one who could stand as an equal before kings and nobles. How could he have merely escaped mediocrity?\n\nThus, the wise grieve the fleeting nature of life in the world, lament the swift oblivion of those who vanish without renown, heed the solemn admonition of “morning’s truth,” and yearn to penetrate the unbroken thread of the Dao. They fear the bright warning of impending decline, awaken from the madness of heedless thoughts, and refuse to idle away their days in mere satiation. They do not squander even an inch of time, take the flowing river as a mirror to spur their resolve, and mourn the lightning speed of passing moments. They sever frivolous attachments, reduce worldly trivialities, cleanse their hearts of poverty’s anxieties, and cast off boundless desires. They cease the games of hunting, gambling, and idle play, correct the indolence of daytime naps and listless sitting, and knowing that empty musings yield no benefit, they rouse themselves onto the sagely path.\n\nThey learn to accumulate, inquire to discern, advance virtue and cultivate their work, review the old to grasp the new. Even the sage Duke of Zhou read a hundred chapters daily; Confucius, of heavenly endowment, wore through the thongs of his bamboo scrolls three times. Mo Di, the great worthy, filled carts with his writings; Dong Zhongshu, a man of his age, never glanced beyond his garden gate. Ni Kuan carried his books while weeding with a hoe; Lu Sheng cut reeds to transcribe texts. Huang Ba studied while in shackles; Ning Yue doubled his efforts through night and day. Thus, they delved into the profound mysteries of the Dao, plumbed the depths of subtle words, observed ten thousand ages as if in a single day, and knew the eight wilds as if their own courtyard. They examined the waxing and waning of the Seven Luminaries, traced the transformations of the Three and Five, discerned the signs of rise and decline to come, verified good and ill in past events, and foretold the fortunes of the Yellow and Mysterious as if reading their palms. They discerned incipient signs as if already fulfilled. Thus, their great virtue and towering achievements crowned their age, and their pure fragrance and illustrious renown spread without end.\n\nMoreover, upon hearing the cry of the *shangyang* bird, one prepares for floods; consulting the *niaonu* oracle, one brings order to the east. Inquiring of the floating gourd, one speaks of colors and tastes; questioning the earthen dog, one knows the burial sheep. Through the *Lingbao* scriptures, one understands the forms of mountains and streams; from a broken chopstick, one expounds the *Zhuanche* classic. Gazing at the *libi* constellation, one distinguishes the signs of yin and yang; from the winter locust, one perceives the errors in intercalary months. What mystery is there? It is learning alone.\n\nEven children’s rhymes aid the sage’s ears and eyes—how much more the profound and vast teachings of the ancient texts? Talent and nature vary in excellence; thought and reason differ in depth. Some possess innate knowledge and mature early; others must be led by the ear before they understand. Swiftness is like the feet of the *lü* steed; slow comprehension is like the wings of the quail. Though the former may gallop far and halt abruptly, they do not surpass a single step. Though the latter may advance but a foot at a time, if they persist without ceasing, they may cross mountains and marshes. Is not the distinction between bright and dim learning much the same?\n\nIn youth, the will is single and hard to forget; in age, the spirit scatters and is easily lost. Therefore, one must devote oneself to study early, so that practice becomes as natural as inborn nature.\n\nAs for those of extraordinary talent who, in their prime, encounter misfortune—though they lose the dawn at *Yanggu*, they may yet gather it at *Yuyuan*. One then knows that late sowing in good fields is better than a year of barren waste. The parable of the candle’s light is apt indeed.\n\nIn this troubled age, the teachings of the Ru have declined, and the paths of Wen and Wu are on the verge of collapse. Some drown in sensual pleasures; others race along the paths of rivalry. The poor and solitary who master the Six Arts are suppressed like resources in a drought; those who cling to the wind and attach themselves to phoenix wings, though of mediocre talent, may yet soar to the clouds. Those who abandon fundamentals for trivialities call it diligent cultivation; those who embrace the classics and seek within themselves are deemed obscure and impractical. Thus, all are dust-stained, rain-soaked, frost-crowned, and ice-trodden, clutching their yellowed scrolls and holding fast to purity, yet drawn to the easy paths of crooked ways, hoping for morning sowing and evening harvest.\n\nIf, instead, one lowers the curtain and rests on a high pillow, roams the spirit through the Nine Classics, delves into the subtleties of the arts, savors the profound flavor of the Dao, and dwells in refined seclusion—if one establishes an unshakable resolve, unfurls one’s green banner in the bitter cold, does not measure the world to choose one’s path, and does not drift with the crowd like floating duckweed—how few are such men!\n\nThose who rush anxiously toward advancement and fret over setbacks—how can they abandon the broad and easy thoroughfare to cling to the most difficult and surely impassable road? This is why there are no men by the riverside, why the scholars of *Zijin* lament the customs of the age, why those who grieve for the Dao sigh in sorrow and sink into melancholy.\n\nYet cold and heat alternate, adversity ends in prosperity, and Wen and Wu rise in turn—this is the constant pattern of nature. May the bandit hordes be swept away, the restoration flourish in our time, the Seven Luminaries follow their ancient courses, and the celestial order be renewed! May the great furnace of the Nine Suns turn the great potter’s wheel, the imperial model open the mysterious pattern to guide all things, and the myriad beings be shaped and refined, their finest blossoms cultivated! May the accumulated dust be swept away, evil be transformed into good, weapons be sheathed, and bows cased! May the schools of the *Biyong* be revived, the sons of the state gathered, culture and virtue flourish, golden sounds and jade tones resound, and wind and clouds descend before the dawn! May the travelers from the hills and gardens, the phoenixes with folded wings, soar in the clear void; may the swift steeds with sturdy necks gallop a thousand *li*!\n\nMay those of hidden brilliance, stifled and unrecognized, those of vast learning and deep understanding—men like Shen Gong and Fu Sheng—be summoned with crimson carriages and rush mats, their pent-up energies released, their plain virtues displayed! May they assist the sagely age in reaching the lofty heights of Tang and Yu, and speed along the broad path of grand peace! May the mysterious stream moisten the nine realms, the celestial wind spread beyond all bounds! May the Five Punishments be set aside and songs of praise arise, harmonious qi flourish and fine harvests grow—is this not joyous indeed?\n\nOnce, the Second Emperor of Qin held no esteem for the Ru arts, abandoning the Way of the former sages to study the laws of punishment and imprisonment. The people saw no virtue—only the sound of execution. Thus bewildered, they knew not how to turn back; lost, they knew not how to save themselves. They plunged from the heights of the clouds, only to be crushed to powder in the unfathomable depths. From the exalted to the base, can there be no mirror?\n\n**Chapter Four: Exalting Teaching**\nThe *Baopuzi* states: Those who fix their gaze upon autumn’s finest hairs do not perceive the radiance of heaven’s patterns. Those who immerse their hearts in trivial affairs do not grasp the profundity and vastness of the Ru Dao. Dwellers in the stench of salted fish forget the fragrance of orchids; the deeply lost cannot find their way back. Those who receive the guidance of Mo Di possess no crooked or hollowed wood; those who are steeped in the teachings of the Dao produce no perverse or deviant people. No method of cultivation surpasses learning.\n\nThe breadth of learning lies in tirelessness; tirelessness lies in steadfast resolve. If resolve is not steadfast, the poor and lowly will be consumed by the struggle for survival, while the rich and noble will drown in ease and pleasure. Thus, those of far-reaching vision and profound knowledge appear but rarely across the ages, while the ignorant—those who see no farther than a wall—throng shoulder to shoulder.\n\nIf common scholars by day till the soil to feed themselves and by night kindle firewood to pursue their studies; if those in office, in the intervals of feasting and revelry, occasionally turn their gaze to exhortation and admonition—then the world would know no utter fools, and men like Ziyou and Zixia would not be lacking.\n\nYet there are those pressed by hunger and cold, whose coarse fare is insufficient, whose skin is chapped by wind and frost, whose mouths lack even husks and chaff. They have no means to seek a teacher, their families face imminent crisis. If they set aside the plow, the farm lies fallow; if they take up the scroll, their livelihood suffers. Though their learning is incomplete, they may be excused.\n\nThese are like a steed of a thousand *li* trapped beneath a salt cart, or a blade of finest ore never tempered in the forge of Ou Ye. But as for the scions of kings and nobles, who idle in luxury and pleasure, who dance amid silks and brocades, ignorant of the hardships of sowing and reaping—whose eyes grow weary of the profound and whose ears tire of the refined, whose noses are sated with the fragrances of Zheng and Wei—how can they be compared?\n\nAmidst the cloying sweetness of orchid and musk, their palates grow jaded beyond fine meats and rich grains. In winter, they tread in the warmth of sable and fox; in summer, they flutter in the lightness of gauze and silk. They ride forth in carriages grander than Qing Feng’s, and retire to banquet in halls resplendent as Bi Fang’s. Vermilion and kingfisher blue adorn their pillars and beams, while their chests and coffers overflow without end. They array allure and charm to delight the heart, drown themselves in fine wines to sink into drunkenness—becoming champions of gluttony and drink, masters of gambling and games. They neither comprehend literature nor recognize scholars, whom they regard as mere weeds. Their speech and writing lack classical grounding, their arguments tangled in confusion. When pressed in debate, they speak only of warfare; when faced with doubt, they wither before their time. Even if they could distinguish beans from wheat, what difference would it make? They are blind indeed!\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: It is said that the emperor’s eldest heir must enter the Grand Academy, study under a master, and learn the Dao, taking his place among the sons of the state. Only after knowing how to be a minister can one become a ruler; only after knowing how to be a son can one become a father. Thus, learning is established before office, for to govern without learning is like wielding a knife to carve—inevitably causing harm. This is what Zheng Qiao lamented when he spoke of indulging emotions and desires, calling it inhuman.\n\nYet the noble scions are born within the depths of the palace, raised by the hands of women. They have never known the labor of worry or fear. Some are scarcely free of swaddling clothes before being clad in robes of blue and purple; others have barely outgrown their garments before assuming high and illustrious positions. They wield the power of life and death, control promotions and demotions, decide honor and disgrace through their grants and withdrawals, and sway fortune and misfortune with a word. Love and hate shift without pause, while praise and blame assail their ears. Suspicions arise from vague resemblances, where truth and falsehood blur; they seize opportunities to accuse without cause, or fabricate slander from empty trust. The permutations of flattery and deceit are endless, their intricacies beyond the reach of cunning manipulation or the scrutiny of brush and ink.\n\nWithout the arts of learning, how can they discern the true from the false in right and wrong? Moreover, the events of past and present, the principles of self-realization—without these as guides, how can they avoid the disasters of overturned nests and wrecked chariots? The sages of old, though high in station, never forgot the dangers; loving their children, they sought to teach them the proper way. They refined and polished them, guarding against corruption, selecting enlightened teachers to shape their character, and choosing worthy friends to influence them. They urged them to broad reading, showed them success and failure, bade them examine the past to understand the future, observe others to know themselves. They drove them onto the straight path, restrained them within bounds, and instilled awe in their hearts.\n\nShould one cling to the edge of a thousand-fathom cliff, trembling as though riding a galloping steed across thin ice, one may yet avoid far-reaching regrets and preserve one’s integrity and good fortune.\n\nOf old, the Dou clan reaped the blessings of the Dao’s teachings, while Huo Yu suffered the calamity of following his own whims. Zhongshan and Dongping found security in their love of antiquity, whereas Yan and Ci, facing walls, courted peril. The past is not forgotten—it serves as a fine mirror for the present.\n\nTang and Wu flourished under the influence of Yi and Lü, while Xin and Gui, swayed by flatterers, fell into ruin. In choosing friends and teachers, one must be especially discerning, selecting those of humble origins and virtuous conduct—men who stand firm in hardship and command respect through their singular resolve. Let their learning be like that of Zhongshu or Huan Rong, their integrity as unyielding as Gong Sui or Wang Ji. Let them discourse day and night on the supreme Way of loyalty and filial piety, clarifying the patterns of survival and ruin, purging defilements, guarding against waywardness, and correcting crookedness. One must suppress personal inclinations, adhere to the law, and enter the teachings of virtue.\n\nIn the late Han and the final years of Wu, matters stood otherwise. Officials were chosen for their carriages and caps, appointed on the basis of partisan praise. Though they bore the name of teachers and friends, they offered no substance—no one to correct oversights. Far from being harmless, they brought harm instead. What they expounded was not the Dao and its virtue; what they recommended was not loyalty and benefit.\n\nOnly did they indulge in novel melodies and alluring beauties, appraising with delicate skill the purity or muddiness of songs, the length or brevity of flutes, the strength or weakness of hounds and horses, the merits of hunting grounds, the preferences of divergent paths, the refinement or crudeness of carvings, the dexterity or clumsiness of *tanqi* and *mocu* games, the victories or defeats in fishing and fowling, the grace or homeliness of courtesans and concubines, the rusticity or elegance of garments, the excellence or flaws of carriages, the precision or coarseness of bows and swords, gathering the strange and uniting the rare—until their excesses knew no bounds, growing daily and monthly more extravagant.\n\nWhen they spoke of palaces, they likened them distantly to Jasper Terraces and Jade Chambers, or imitated nearby the grandeur of Epang and Lingguang, deeming a thousand gates and ten thousand halls too cramped, the Kunming and Taiye lakes too shallow. They mocked thatched roofs as unworthy, earthen steps as crude. The people’s strength was exhausted by labor, their stores squandered on frivolities. They raised earthen mountains to rival Song and Hua, dug canals to mimic the Nine Rivers. They ascended lofty towers and opened lattice windows that pierced the clouds. Lewd music clamored to bewitch the ear, fluttering sleeves dazzled to confuse the eye. The debaucheries of Pu Shang and Bei Li followed one upon another—now wailing, now shouting—turning day into night. They lingered over cups of wine, drowned in the throes of revelry. Some built emerald canopies in lush groves, others shot fierce birds in the wilds or raced swift steeds over treacherous paths. They exposed their retinues to the blazing sun, setting out with torches and returning by starlight. State affairs were neglected, rewards and punishments abandoned.\n\nSome launched ornate boats upon the shimmering waves, cast dense nets in the green rivers, dangled fragrant bait in rippling pools, or unleashed singing cormorants in clear streams to snare fish with sinking lines. They loosed high-flying arrows to bring down light-winged geese, or wove *fufu* nets in the forests, encircled mountains and marshes with layered battues, arrayed crimson pennants among the wind-tossed grasses, and galloped fleet steeds across the plains. They unleashed hounds to tear at cunning beasts, flew swift hawks to seize soaring birds, felled raging rhinos with powerful crossbows, and slew bears and tigers with long spears. Such pursuits, year after year, brought no weariness, continuing without end.\n\nTo this were added the frequent seasonal visits—welcoming and seeing off guests, celebrating and congratulating, exchanging gifts with close associates, and receiving distinguished visitors bearing tokens of esteem. The affairs of the world pressed urgently, bending and exhausting all. Thus did refined propriety drift ever farther away, and indulgent dissipation take deeper root, until the distance from the learning of the Ru grew vast indeed.\n\nHow rare in such an age were those who could perceive the principles of rise and decline, rise above the depths of dissipation, forsake the perilous paths of corrupt virtue, and tread the great Way of enduring order!\n\nAlas! Thus it is that those who preserve the state and secure their families are exceedingly rare, while those who collapse in ruin, weeping blood, are without number.\n\nNow, with sagely brightness reigning above, the ancient ways are examined to succor the world, dikes are strengthened to prevent breaches, and praise and blame are made clear to manifest encouragement and deterrence. One must hope that the imperial clan, the noble houses, and the wealthy and powerful will surely vie to esteem the Ru arts, restrain extravagance in the literary arts, and set aside the ideas of Lao and Zhuang. What is not urgent is the refinement of the Six Classics’ true Way.\n\n**The Way of the Ruler, Fifth Chapter**\nThe *Baopuzi* states: The pure and refined ascends and floats upward; the turbid and yellow sinks and flows downward. Thus are the distinctions of rank and awe established. The sages of old drew from the Two Modes to establish the Way of ruler and minister, and by setting offices and dividing duties, the flourishing of harmonious transformation was achieved. He who would rule others must first cultivate himself to lead the Four Seas, cast aside partiality to equalize the kingly Way, and dispel private attachments to exemplify perfect impartiality. He must model the cosmos to encompass the ten thousand differences. Once truth and falsehood are made clear beyond all things, he must further rely on his own discernment. Once hearing is sharpened by what comes before him, he must further rely on his own perception.\n\nHe must emulate the water-level to advance the good, and the carpenter’s square to dismiss the wicked. He must display virtue and block transgression, employ the near and cherish the worthy, allowing compasses to exhaust their circles and squares to fulfill their angles. He must wield the adze to test its cutting edge, entrusting tasks without measure and employing talents without misallocation. He must examine names and demand realities, frequently inspect and diligently relieve. He must establish canonical teachings to set the people’s ultimate standard, carefully weigh praise and blame to manifest encouragement and deterrence, restrain disorder to prevent usurpation and excess, and scrutinize正直 and crookedness to avert regret and resentment.\n\nIn bestowing, let there be no favoritism in judgment; in deprivation, let there be no concealment by the Hundred Schools. Let the Six Arts be the craftsman’s tools, loyalty and trust the guiding principles, governance the exercise of kindness and harmony, and regulation the application of ritual and punishment. He must elevate the obscure and redress the suppressed, stir the clear currents to purify the turbid, ensuring that things follow no devious paths and affairs adhere to no improper divisions.\n\nThose who stand in court or govern the people must not encroach upon offices or overstep bounds. Those who advance to war must not shrink from danger or evade commands. He must please the near to embrace the distant, cultivate culture to attract the estranged, enrich the people’s wealth and grain, and broaden the paths of advancing virtue. He must block the proliferation of deceit and cunning. When affairs demand it, let punishments be clear and laws strict; when trials are adjudicated, let compassion and reverence prevail. When transformation is pure and governance orderly, let flaws be concealed and faults hidden.\n\nThe Five Teachings lie in magnanimity. Externally, he must gather the many officers in civil and martial arts; internally, he must build the inner bastions of kinship, making close and distant relatives support one another. The tail becomes the body’s trunk, and though branches may flourish, there is no fear of harming the root. Though streams may swell, there is no risk of turning from the source. Like a stone basin or a mountain’s peak, he must firmly check covetous designs. Seeing the collapse of the Three Miao, one knows the springs of rivers cannot be dammed. Witnessing the loss of hidden shadows, one realizes that perilous cliffs cannot be relied upon.\n\nThe Yangtze and Han remain, yet strong foes humiliate the sword’s edge. Armies unite as one, yet Ziyang’s clan is exterminated. The Four Peaks and Three Hills do not belong to a single family. Metal walls and boiling moats are not as secure as human harmony. Guarding lies beyond the seas, not in mountains and rivers. Thus, the worthy ruler, ever fearful of insufficiency, reforms his faults in dread of excess. When plans are deemed sound, he still contemplates danger without respite. Though victorious in war and lands expanded, he remains vigilant against complacency and retires at dusk.\n\nHe models the vast heavens to extend his radiance, emulates the earth’s thickness to broaden his bearing, and wields the sun’s brilliance to illuminate the distant. He relies on spring’s warmth to nurture and autumn’s frost to discipline. He repays counsel to compare similarities and differences, balances scales to weigh the many words, and empties himself to exhaust the sentiments below. He attributes merit to encourage posterity.\n\nGoverned by method, his beginnings and ends may be exhausted. Ordered by measure, disparities may be gauged. Towering like the windswept heights above the sky, none below can estimate his weight. Profound as the abyss with its myriad blades, none nearby can fathom his depth. Thus, the ruler’s source and flow are inexhaustible, and the talents of the hundred officials are fully displayed. My bounds are without limit, and their capacities may be measured.\n\nWhen he issues commands, they resound like thunder’s clap, unaltered by perverse arguments. When he establishes laws and creates systems, they shine like the Seven Luminaries adorning the sky, unbent by love or hate. His grand strategies and far-reaching plans gather like dense clouds high above. Abiding in steadfastness to complete affairs, he stands firm as Mount Song’s roots in the earth. He discerns the hidden and manifest before their signs appear, examines praise and blame from the mouths of cunning speakers, and does not allow simplicity to scatter into artifice or integrity to dissolve into duplicity.\n\nThough capable of independent judgment, he must broadly accept the humble’s advice. Though devoted to refinement, he must purify his ears to the murmurs. When the people suffer cold and hunger, he pities them and blames himself. When the people are at fault, he deems it his own responsibility. When auspicious omens arrive, he credits the gods’ aid. When Heaven’s wrath descends, he reflects on the prayers of the mulberry groves. He does not hesitate to reform what should be changed, nor is he ashamed to retrace his steps when lost.\n\nHe glares like a tiger to warn the secretive, and stands firm as a unicorn to welcome the upright. If no elders sing in the fields, he is ashamed to hear harmonious music. If the people lack grain, he is humbled before sumptuous feasts. Facing the vastness of the heavens, he fears the toil of those who come willingly. Savoring tender delicacies, he worries over the untimely harvest. Hearing the music of pipes and strings, he grieves over excessive pleasure. Gazing upon splendid adornments, he frets over harsh levies.\n\nHe follows Yao’s coarse robes and models Wen of Wei’s plain silks. He recalls the Xia’s humble palaces, recognizes the unbuilt Terrace of Dew, and learns from Zhanghua’s calamity and Epang’s swift ruin. In proclamations and oaths, he remembers the loss of trust in a single moment. In amusement, he perceives Daji’s bewitchment. In campaigns, he measures strength and timing, ensuring no hundred *li* resound with the people’s lament. In executions, he follows human sentiment and reason, ensuring no unjust souls cling to the wine-skin.\n\nHe takes warning from Du Bo’s spectral vengeance and the cries of the wronged. He heeds the great delusion of Duke Xian of Jin in deposing his heir, and the annihilation of Liu Biao’s line in appointing a concubine’s son. In hunting, he rejoices in losing game to gain worthy men, and delights in casting nets to welcome the distant. In favoritism, he fears the slander of Zhao Feiyan and the monopolization of Flying Swallow. In sole reliance, he perceives the perils of the deer and horse. In honoring the upright, he recalls Gaozu’s reception of advice and Jing’s execution of Cuo.\n\nIn indulgence, he guards against Yi Di’s influence. In yielding to flattery, he examines Luan Ying’s removal and the banishment of Zhengzi. He learns from the white dragon to curb recklessness, and observes the emaciated steed to temper insatiability. He prevents the transformation of humans into swine within the six palaces, and halts the pursuit of \"sweating blood\" horses from distant lands. He removes vicious dogs to avoid the disaster of wine-cups, and purchases horse bones to attract swift steeds. He spares the angry frog to encourage bravery, and avoids the mantis to inspire martial valor.\n\nHe listens to Gonglu’s forthright words and embraces Baoshen’s integrity. He plucks the useless hairs from back and belly, and grasps the six pinions for soaring flight. He silences the flattering tongues to heed the admonitions of the *Siyuan*, and prunes the withered and decayed to promote Liang Bo’s beauty. He exiles the seductive Ji to dispel bewitching allure, and retires Zixia to prevent the temptation of the \"leftover peach.\" He conceals the fish in the abyss and wields the handle of the sharp blade. He does not shrink from the trouble of moving firewood to prevent the cost of scorching.\n\nHe fosters the cultivation of integrity and shame, and clarifies the standards of examinations. His anger does not exceed the law to inflict cruelty, nor does his joy transgress statutes to bestow lavish gifts. He severs affection for those he loves when they transgress, granting no pardon. He adopts goodness from those he dislikes when they labor, granting no exemption. He humbles himself to seek loyal counsel and welcomes unwelcome words.\n\nHis decrees are like thunder’s roar, unshaken by sophistry. His laws shine like the stars, unbent by partiality. His strategies gather like clouds, his steadfastness stands firm as mountains. He discerns hidden truths, examines praise and blame, and prevents simplicity from scattering into artifice. Though decisive, he seeks the humble’s advice; though refined, he purifies his ears. He pities the people’s suffering, blames himself for their faults, credits the gods for blessings, and reflects on his errors in calamity. He reforms without hesitation, retraces his steps without shame, warns the secretive, and welcomes the upright.\n\nHe is ashamed by the people’s want, humbled by their toil, and grieves over their excesses. He follows the ancients’ frugality, learns from past calamities, and heeds warnings from history. He executes justly, rewards fairly, and listens to all voices. He governs with method and measure, towering above all, profound beyond fathoming. His rule is inexhaustible, his officials’ talents fully displayed. His commands resound like thunder, his laws shine like stars, his strategies gather like clouds, and his steadfastness stands firm as mountains. He discerns hidden truths, examines praise and blame, and ensures no simplicity is lost to artifice. He governs with wisdom, listens to counsel, and rules with impartiality.\n\nYet he does not shun broad appeals for counsel, nor reject slanderous words. Though cast down, he does not spurn them; though flaws be minor, he records great merit. He forgets recent wrongs and remembers distant deeds, so that Cao Gui and Meng Ming find renewed purpose, Wei Shang and Zhang Chang achieve vengeance for past shame. The treacherous minister who shot the hook earns merit in restoring order; the captive strategist Li Zuoche offers counsel to halt the spear. Thus, owls and kites transform into mandarin ducks and phoenixes, deceit and falsehood turn to loyalty and steadfastness. Fragrant blossoms flourish in barren salt flats, radiant pearls emerge from mud and mire. Dull blades are sharpened, and all nine virtues harmonize in perfect accord.\n\nFacing west, he hesitates to defer to the talents of teachers and friends, honoring the elderly to foster filial piety and fraternal duty. Thus, those coiled in the depths look up to ascend, and those dwelling in mountains descend to gather. Brilliant and flourishing, they assist within; fierce and mighty, they defend without. Governance is secured above, and the people submit below. Virtue shines near, and its blessings extend afar. The wise exert their strength in their posts, while the common folk yield their disputes in marshes and wetlands.\n\nThereupon, he purges oppressive laws and revives the pure breeze of grand harmony. With carriages of rushes and gifts of jade and silk, he draws forth the hidden talents of hills and gardens. Eminent ministers assemble to deliberate the gains and losses of the Dao. He reduces the ranks of shepherds and those who do not brew fine wine, expands the gates of humility, and blocks the paths of vain competition. He commends the conduct of righteousness and integrity, upholds the standards of the Dao and simplicity, so that those who cleave to virtue rejoice as tender shoots in sweet rain, and those who return are like flowing streams converging in the great river. The people rest as securely as green leaves clinging to sturdy branches, and those with left-folding robes gaze up as stars revolve around the North Star.\n\nThus, the seven celestial bodies do not stray from their course, aligned with the supreme pole. Cold and warmth do not err in their seasons but follow their proper order. The four spirit-beasts appear, auspicious fungi glow, sweet dew drips from the heavens, and bountiful grain sways in full ears. Red drought-demons flee to the divine moat, and plague spirits are bound in distant lands. Rivers do not surge in strange tumult, nor does the Southern Dipper stir the violence of withered grain. Things do not wither in unnatural decay, nor do people utter sighs of lament. Prisons stand empty, the five punishments lie dormant, and the calendar’s renewal reaches where caps and sashes do not, where felt and furs, mountain-dwellers and river-exiles all embrace joy, transform their countenance, and respond to harmony. Distant lands offer rare birds to the vermilion court, jade rings arrive from the westernmost reaches, and round-headed tribes swiftly reform as if mist harmonizing with a strong wind. The remote borderlands obey his commands like an echo answering sound, like a perfect note responding to pure tone.\n\nSuch is the height of flourishing rule, the path trodden by the Three August Ones and Five Emperors. Thus, he secures the ancestral temple without end and extends his lineage through a hundred generations.\n\nFor when roots run deep, branches flourish; when those below rejoice, those above find peace. If a horse is untrained, even Zaofu cannot urge it beyond a thousand *li*; if the people are not attached, even Yao and Shun cannot achieve the beauty of heaven’s harmony. When a horse reaches its limit, unruly behavior arises and collapse follows—this is the sole cause for concern. When the people suffer, rebellion multiplies and disaster inevitably strikes. Should one not tremble with vigilance, awaiting the dawn? Should one not quake with apprehension, ever mindful of peril?\n\nIf a ruler does not clarify his thoughts on order and chaos, nor deeply reflect on the signs of ruin, though his eyes may discern the finest autumn down, his ears distinguish the purest and harshest of the eight sounds, though his literary brilliance cascades like jade from his brush-tip, his martial prowess wields the gleaming blade as if it were an extension of his palm, though his heart retains the recitation of ten thousand texts and his tongue dispenses eloquence like surging waves—all this avails nothing when the earth crumbles beyond salvation, when dissolution is already upon him.\n\nWhy is this so? Because he neglects the great to obsess over the trivial, immerses himself in the affairs of subordinates while remaining blind to the foundational origins. If only he could act with frugality beyond excess, tread as if over deep abysses and thin ice, remain ever wary of reckless haste even in times of safety, and never abandon the fear of ruin even in moments of stability. If he grasps the main cords to order the fine threads, wields the Dao’s principles to govern the multitude, employs the combined strength of Han and Bai to break enemy lines, and exhausts the talents of Xiao and Cao to administer the state; if the armored heart is resolute in its courage and the strategist’s mind collaborates to advance its far-reaching plans—then the ruler, though at ease within his jade chambers, wandering the cloud-topped pavilions, where wine spoils in sweet brews and musicians weary from their dances, may still govern with folded arms, entrusting matters to the worthy, and rest upon his pillow, holding them accountable. Why must he dwell in humble thatched huts, partake of meager fare, endure the toil of guarding the gates, or bear the hardships of a life diminished before he can bring prosperity to the common people and extend the Dao’s harmony beyond the seas?\n\nDeluded rulers, however, act otherwise. In their governance...\n\nSome are benevolent yet indecisive, where vermilion and purple blur in chaos, the upright go unrewarded, and the wicked escape punishment. Others are harsh and cruel, wielding authority without mercy, their punishments excessive and unforgiving, never matching crime to consequence. Their foundations crumble, their roots exposed, yet they perch precariously like nests upon a canopy, comparing themselves to the sun and moon, likening their stature to Mount Tai. They believe that those of towering virtue are easily matched, while the cautious and reverent fall short of their mark.\n\nThus, the innocent suffer unjust punishments, and the people see no virtue—only the specter of execution. Officials deem the compliant as worthy, promoting those who curry favor while sidelining the capable. The court fills with the mother’s kin, who monopolize power, while decisions rest in the hands of flatterers. Those of distant lineage or merit are overlooked, their talents disregarded, while the trusted are petty sycophants. The forthright are suppressed, their voices drowned in the chorus of conformity, while the favored rise on empty praise, their achievements unexamined. Those entrusted with governance and defense—some corrupt their posts, others sow discord in the court, some falter in weakness, and others, timid and craven, squander military advantage. Yet the ruler, blind to their failings, refuses to demote or dismiss them, instead clinging to hope for their redemption. Small vessels tasked with great burdens inevitably court disaster. Meanwhile, the truly capable—those of broad vision and unsupported merit—languish in obscurity, some clad in coarse robes at court, others sunk in poverty, their Way confined, their strength untapped. Such is the root of decline and ruin.\n\nMoreover, they ignore the classics and their warnings, neglecting study to indulge in revelry. They build towering pavilions while neglecting the Dao, expand parks and gardens while narrowing benevolence, deepen moats and ponds while shallowing trust and faith. They delight in hounds and horses yet despise forthright counsel, prize jewels and jade while scorning wisdom and strategy, adorn themselves in fine silks while skimping on relief for the poor, delay aid while hastening to amass wealth, obsess over the hunt while neglecting the harvest, exalt the wealthy while devaluing lives. They elevate entertainers and dismiss scholars, lavish favor on courtiers while slighting warriors, drown in sensual pleasures while ignoring state affairs, prioritize drunken revelry over judgment, impose harsh labor while withholding rewards, and squander resources on frivolous crafts, hoarding delicacies while the people starve. In such a state, ruin cannot be blamed on Heaven, nor weakness attributed to others.\n\nFortune and misfortune lie within oneself—were Tang and Wu exceptions? Of old, King Wen of Zhou buried the unburied bones, and the world praised his benevolence; King Zhou of Yin carved out Bi Gan’s heart, and the seas reviled his cruelty. The gaze of all rests upon the ruler—praise or blame, success or failure—hinges not on quantity but on weight. When praise is abundant, even distant tribes embrace virtue, yet it cannot be feigned. When blame accumulates, the heart of the realm fractures, and no words can mend it. Thus, small virtues, though of little immediate benefit, must not be neglected, and minor vices, though seemingly harmless, must not be indulged.\n\nThose who indulge their desires without sharing joy with the people find no solace in their sorrows. Those who erode their foundations and heighten their perch fail to see the collapse beneath them, and none remain to prop them up. Then, reins slip from their grasp, divine artifacts are seized and never returned, strength is exhausted, wealth depleted, and the people can bear no more. Resentment festers below, Heaven’s wrath gathers above. Fields become bandits, and within the tent, Qi and Qi plot; Ji Chang seizes Yin from the west, while Chen and Wu rise with swords drawn. Liu and Xiang brandish spears, their fury like a gale. Scaling ladders breach the hundred-zhang walls, blades clash beneath the palace gates, and flaming arrows rain upon the inner palace. The outer defenses crumble, and only then do they lament, seeking distant sages, sweeping the path to welcome recluses, yearning for Yi and Lü from the mountains, summoning Sun and Wu from the wilds. They beg for wise counsel yet heed none, seek grand strategies yet ask no questions—like pouring water from the sea to douse a burning mansion, or crafting a boat after the flood has swept away the home.\n\nThe lofty title of \"majestic\" cannot be claimed through arrogance and stinginess, nor can the seal of Mount Tai’s enfeoffment be secured through wanton desire. Even the sagest of rulers, spurring their chariots to the limit, feared falling short of the past—yet mediocre sovereigns, ambling at a leisurely pace, believe themselves superior. Some, in safety, contemplate peril; others, in peril, indulge in ease. Some, having achieved order, remain vigilant and unyielding; others, teetering on the edge like a string of eggs, remain oblivious, unaware. Without the downfall of tyrants like Xin and Gui, how could the value of reverence and wisdom be so keenly felt? Let this be ever in mind—oh, ever in mind!\n\n**Ministerial Integrity (Chapter Six)**\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity said: In the ancient eras of Tang and Yu, though they examined antiquity and revered wisdom, they still awaited the assisting brilliance of their ministers to achieve towering success. Thus, the imperial enterprise flourished, all affairs coalesced, the Four Gates stood solemn, the Hundred Offices proceeded in harmony, and the barbarians posed no threat to the Central Kingdom. The Phoenix nested in the Aligned Chambers—\n\nThis may be likened to the head and the limbs: though there exists a distinction of honor and humility, in truth, they rely upon one another as one body. The ruler must measure ability before bestowing office, lest the overturned tripod’s ruin ensue. The minister must weigh his talents before accepting, that he may avoid the calamity of exile.\n\nThose who, like shadow and echo, bow and obey every command are but hollow vessels of idleness. Those who defy orders, confront authority, and steadfastly reject self-interest are the pillars that secure the throne. Those who anticipate desires and flatter are the sycophants. Those who correct errors and rectify deviations are the state’s unyielding backbone.\n\nIf one must prostrate before the executioner’s block to offer forthright remonstrance, or cling to the cauldron’s edge to speak truth—when loyalty is met with suspicion and slander prevails—then exile may be endured. If one’s death would serve no purpose but to compound the ruler’s faults, then departure is permissible.\n\nIn all actions, if they are not grounded in the canonical teachings, they must not be undertaken.\n\nWhen at rest, they do not follow established norms without cause. Petitions and solicitations find no place; personal barriers are never breached for private ends. Punishments are administered with clarity, never indiscriminately. What grieves them is that rewards are not bestowed upon those who curry favor, that they do not usurp authority to amass power, that they do not tolerate corruption while feigning purity. In office, they strive to speak fully to correct errors; in retirement, they ponder how to recommend the worthy without obstruction. Rising early and retiring late, they are anxious that the people’s affairs are not at peace. Their personal conduct is frugal, their aspirations restrained, as though guarding against treading on thin ice. They accept counsel and present scholars, yet never boast of it; they do not dwell on gains that are not righteous. In their hearts, when standing in court, they hold fast to the integrity of an arrow’s shaft; in private, they take the completion of good deeds as their standard. When facing peril or encountering difficulty, they abandon their families without hesitation. When wielding the scales of justice, they weigh with impartiality, making no distinction between near and far. They emulate the directives of Xiao He and Cao Shen, admire the extraordinary strategies of Zhang Liang and Chen Ping, pursue the loyal devotion of Zhou Bo, model themselves on the uprightness of the two Bao, uphold the frugality and integrity of Yuan Ang, and maintain the steadfast resolve of Tian Fen. In the end, they willingly accept the fate of Yao Li, who burned his body, while guarding against the disaster of Han Xin and Ying Bu, who lost their loyalty.\n\nThey do not shirk labor when sent forth, nor do they boast of merit upon return. They ascribe achievements to others, take blame upon themselves, and yield precedence to those below. Their sincerity is reverent and trembling, ever as though the awe of Heaven’s majesty were before their faces. Day and night, they remain vigilant, as though a seething cauldron stood at their side. When burdened with great trust, they take Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou as their models; when exerting themselves in the four directions, they follow the examples of Ji Dan and Shao Hu. In sending off the departed and attending to the living, they exhaust their loyalty without wavering. When seizing traitors who violate the law, they are as fierce as hawks and falcons preying on sparrows. In defending the frontiers, they emulate the lofty footsteps of Wei Jiang and Li Mu. In governing the people, they aspire to the virtuous transformations of Wen Weng and Ren Chen.\n\nThose who are utterly loyal do not use their state for personal gain—how much less would they employ their wisdom to mislead their ruler? Those who are steadfast in righteousness do not fear the destruction of their ancestral temples—how much less would they shrink from demotion or disgrace? Thus, they are able to preserve their meritorious honor, ennoble their kin, and entrust their legacy to posterity. As the odes of the people resound and the ritual vessels of Kunwu endure, the capable inscribe their achievements. What men were Hou Ji and Gao Yao, if not such as these?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: If a minister’s merit is not substantial, he feels shame at the emptiness of his generous salary. If his achievements are not flourishing, he is humiliated by the undeserved height of his rank. Walking in trust and contemplating compliance, he aids both Heaven and man. Fearing excess and dwelling in humility, he ensures lasting fortune. Every step adheres to the rules; every raised hand follows the marking line. Though honors may be delayed, disgrace and regret will surely be far off.\n\nIf, however, one harms the ruler to curry favor with subordinates, abandons the public good to pursue private ends, flatters and obeys to add water to water—even when the ruler’s actions are flawed, he smiles and praises them, repeatedly offering trinkets to lead the ruler into wrongdoing—using clever words to undermine governance, his countenance seeking to please, he obscures the ruler’s clarity below and blocks the path of worthy men’s advancement. Externally, he forms alliances with foreign powers; internally, he cultivates factions that betray the public. Though his talent may suffice to gloss over wrongs, his words to embellish faults, and his authority to rival that of Zhao Gao in dominating the court or Dong Zhuo in his unchecked power—there has never been one who did not end with his body steeped in the executioner’s blade and his family consumed by fire.\n\nYet the foolish and blind abandon the correct to follow the crooked, forsake the true to consort with the false. Though ruin looms, they do not alter their course. The calamities that befall them do not descend from Heaven.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: A minister is like the limbs to the body—when treading on ice or grasping thorns, he cannot refuse. Thus, the ancients compared him to the earth: dig into it, and springs of water emerge; plant in it, and a hundred grains flourish. The living stand upon it; the dead enter it. Though his merits are many, he does not expect reward; though his toils are great, he does not dare complain. Clearly understanding this principle is the key to preserving oneself.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: A minister’s duties are manageable when his responsibilities are limited, but when his charge is vast, much will be neglected. Without the strength of Meng Ben and Xia Yu, one cannot shoulder the weight of multiple men; without the exceptional ability of ten thousand, one cannot oversee unique and complex situations. This is why Han Xin was punished for overstepping his authority and Ziyuan feared the disaster of being unequal to his task.\n\nIf, however, one’s talents are unparalleled, both civil and martial virtues perfectly balanced, possessing within the lofty calculations of a trusted advisor and without the far-reaching strategies of a master diplomat—though affairs may be numerous, all will be accomplished; though paths may diverge, both will be traversed. To abandon such a one is to disrupt the proper order; to entrust him is to find no equal. In such cases, one may take on multiple roles. For those not of this caliber, they should reflect carefully: if a weak cart bears a heavy load, how rarely does it reach its destination!\n\nOrdinary men, when rewarded with honor, do not consider the later perils. Once they are drowned in disaster, it extends to their ruler and kin—is this not lamentable? All decline the axe and adze, yet when in high office, none yield their positions, even when unfit for the duties. Alas! This is why Chen Ping and Li Yiji issued warnings about insufficient strength, and Zhang Liang loftily withdrew to practice restraint.\n\n**Good Governance, Seventh Chapter**\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: Birds that flock together without choosing their trees will surely be those whose nests are abandoned. Those who enter service without assessing the times will surely be men who face danger and disgrace. When the times are favorable, they soar like dragons riding the clouds; when the times are lost, they drift like great fish stranded on high ground. Thus, the wise conceal their talents and await their moment, biding their time to act.\n\nIf lofty crags are about to collapse, thin threads cannot hold them; if the Dragon Gate boils over, a handful of earth cannot dam it. Therefore, they do not recklessly seek profit or gamble on luck.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: The Duke of Zhou’s regency, Yi Yin’s demotion of Tai Jia, Huo Guang’s deposition of the Prince of Changyi, and Sun Lin’s removal of the young emperor—these are called setting aside the Dao to employ expediency for the sake of stabilizing the state. Yet the Duke of Zhou was exiled, with slanderous rumors filling the roads; Yi Yin ultimately faced execution, and a great fog lasted three days; Huo Guang nearly brought ruin upon himself, and his family was soon destroyed; Sun Lin’s head and feet were separated before the mulberry trees he planted had time to change. Their cries of laughter had not yet faded when their wails of sorrow began.\n\n\"If, when in peril, one does not support, of what use is that minister?\" Seven upright ministers could not save a ruler without Dao, allowing villains like Wang Mang to arise, using old precedents to embellish their wrongs while harboring the hearts of wolves and jackals. The foundation of disorder was laid by Yi Yin and Huo Guang. Future gentlemen should take deep heed of this.\n\nThe matter of deposing and installing rulers is a minor compliance with the great reversal—it cannot be prolonged. The deceit of Zhao Wang was already met with censure; how much less can one depose a ruler and expect it to be acceptable? Such men all calculated their actions and, once successful, gradually faced calamity. Yet those whose schemes began in secrecy, who were betrayed by greedy men, whose clans were exterminated and ancestral temples destroyed, while others were enfeoffed—such cases are not few.\n\nIf there are treacherous ministers aiding and abetting tyranny, like Jie’s Gan Xin, Zhou’s Chong Hou and E Lai, or Li’s faction—would it not be easy to replace them with the loyal and good? Remove the many evils at the ruler’s side, banish the corrupt to the four frontiers, hold the borders with arms, uphold the straight Dao, guard the law, maintain strict discipline, wield the axe with righteousness, stand with solemn dignity, reward with certainty, punish without exception, allow no transgressions, appoint the worthy, employ the capable, associate only with the loyal, never act without authorization, proceed only after petitioning, correct the ruler’s errors with reason when he strays, and tremble with reverence, never forgetting respect. Thus, the state will be eternally secure above, and one’s own person will be free from harm below. When the task is accomplished, do not remain; resign and retire. Select the loyal and capable to take one’s place—is this not more than sufficient?\n\nWhy must one seize the sovereign’s seals and endanger the lord one professes to serve? The ruler is as Heaven, as a father—if the ruler may be deposed, then Heaven too may be altered, and a father too may be replaced. Those whose merit overshadows the age go unrewarded; those whose might overawes their lord court peril. Such men, though peerless in victory and conquest, in meritorious toil, are like the bow cast aside once the birds are slain, the hound boiled once the hares are caught. How much more so when one deposes one’s lord and yet expects the successor to cherish him? Is this not akin to a son who abandons the mother who bore him, casts her into the mountain valleys, takes another to raise him, and then boasts, “I am as filial as Boyu or Zeng Shen—only my parent was unfit for service, so I discarded her”? Though others may feast him with triply sacrificial meats, attend him at dusk and dawn, how can they truly hold him dear? Even if he is trusted, men like Huo Guang, though showered with ranks, titles, and boundless rewards, were exalted only by stratagem—was this their true devotion?\n\nTo cast off a wife and slander her former husband, to buy a slave and revile his former master—even common men find such acts unjust. Why? Because they deeply wound the bonds of natural affection. Thus, Yue Yang was shunned for his ruthlessness, and Qin Xi was favored for his excessive indulgence. Yet世人 deem Tang and Wu righteous and Yi Yin and Huo Guang worthy—this only encourages treason. Moreover, deposed rulers are not always wholly at fault: some, while aiding young lords, abuse their power and accumulate great sins, plotting future harm. When their influence still holds, others replace them to avert immediate disaster, securing their own advantage under the guise of stabilizing the realm. Once authority is seized and life-and-death decisions are made, the deposed lord’s divine mandate is lost, and all sins of the lower ranks are laid at his door. Though some may see this, who dares speak openly? Without a Dong Mou or Zhu Xu to devise a plan, without a Nan Shi or Dong Hu to record the crime, who in later days will set the record straight? Only the discerning will realize that the wickedness of Jie and Zhou was not so great, nor the virtue of Tang and Wu so splendid.\n\nThe canons all exalt the ruler and humble the minister, strengthen the trunk and weaken the branches. The *Spring and Autumn*’s principle holds that Heaven cannot be opposed. The sages’ scriptures teach that serving father and lord is as one, and the people’s lives rest on these three bonds, equally upheld. To permit the deposition of rulers is to open the gate to unrighteousness, to let the low overstep the high—how can this serve as instruction? Vulgar scholars, mired in sophistry, debate whether Tang and Wu were like those who ate horse liver to condemn such acts, failing to grasp that adaptability in change is more precious than rigid adherence to goodness, that one may act against the norm without rebelling against principle.\n\nYet earlier writers did not refute such deeds with the great Dao, allowing those of such intent to sharpen their blades and ascend crumbling peaks—this is no way to prolong life, secure the age, or avert danger. Though their fame may briefly flourish and their rewards swiftly gather, it is no different from the sacrificial ox adorned in embroidery, the deep-sea fish coveting buckwheat, the parched man drinking from the clouds, or the starving man gorging on rancid meat. Those who wield the brush all praise such acts as fine tales, turning unpardonable crimes into wisdom in change, leaving men to sigh in endless lament.\n\nIf some admonish me that this harms the sages and will surely bring censure, I reply: Shun and Yu were tested within and without before receiving the mandate at Wen Zu’s shrine. Even if one wished to harm the sages, how could they be harmed? Once, Yan Yannian impeached Huo Guang for unrighteousness, and the court fell silent, unable to refute him. How much less should I fear, when my words serve as a warning to the age and name no one in particular? As the saying goes...\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Difficulty of the Times**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: To fulfill one’s duty without seeking reward may be possible. But to demand that one’s words be heeded and one’s person be secure—this must await a time when the times are not adverse. For those who scheme and obstruct, even the bandit Zhi could not surpass them. They exalt the powerful and suppress the lowly, detest the upright and revile the just, dreading the censure of the impartial and fearing the exposure of their crookedness. Thus, they strive to eliminate those who surpass them to avert their own punishment. Enlightened rulers do not appear in every generation, and mediocre sovereigns confuse black and white. Unable to accept and employ loyal counsel, they may even leak the most earnest admonitions. Thereupon, flatterers like Hong Gong and Shi Xian adorn their cunning words to fabricate semblances of virtue, feigning public spirit to advance their private schemes. Now, those who offer arts of longevity are met with the penalty of immediate execution, and those who propose plans to secure the throne swiftly incur the calamity of endangering their own lives. Thus it is said: It is not the speaking that is difficult—it is the timing of speech that is hard.\n\nEven when the worthy advise the sagely, they may not be immediately accepted. Thus, Yi Yin petitioned Tang seventy times. When the wise counsel the foolish, their words will surely not be received. Thus, King Wen’s remonstrance of Zhou was ultimately rejected. That one’s words are not believed may still be tolerable. But consider the executions of Li Si and Han Fei, the mutilation of Sun Bin by Pang Juan, the slander of Qu Ping by Shangguan, and the framing of Chao Cuo by Yuan Ang—such cases are too numerous to record. Truly, serving as a minister is no easy path, and not by one route alone!\n\nThose who depart and never return leave their achievements to posterity, while those who conceal their talents to await the right moment find that such opportunities arise but once in a hundred lifetimes. Ministers of towering merit appear but once in ages, while sycophants and flatterers fill the pages of history—how grievous is the difficulty of encountering the right time, so extreme as this!\n\nFrom this, I know that men like Lü Shang of the Wei River banks and the recluses of the cliffs and caves—those who bore the instruments of royal counsel and held the talents to save their age—ended their days among the ranks of common laborers, wielding fishing rods and leaning on staffs, never to meet a King Wen or a Gaozong. Such men cannot be faulted.\n\n**On the Governance of Offices, Ninth Chapter**\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: The swift gallop of the famed steeds Lu’er and Ji was due to the driving of Zaofu. The orderly succession of Yu and Ji to the hundred offices was owing to the sovereigns of Tang and Yu. Thus, without toil, they reached a thousand *li*; through yielding and deference, their praises resounded.\n\nYet when lowly slaves ride fine steeds like *Suqiang* or when King Xin of Yin rules over the Three Worthies, should they seek to charge ahead, the reins will chafe and the yoke press tight; should they strive to offer exhaustive counsel and exhaust their loyalty, disaster will strike like a loosed crossbow. Thus, the chariot overturns on treacherous roads, and the state collapses beyond recovery.\n\nFor this reason, noble steeds are ruined by clumsy drivers, and wise scholars stumble in benighted times. Confucius could not halt the Duke of Lu from setting out, nor could Yan Ying prevent the rebellion of Cui Zhu—such men possessed the talent, but their lords were unworthy.\n\nThe lord is like a vessel; the minister, like its contents.\n\nA vessel small cannot contain a thing large; thus, a child may cast aside a thousand pieces of gold to chase a butterfly, and the people of Yue may spurn the eight delicacies to relish frogs and toads. What they prize is not truly precious, and what ails them is their failure to recognize what is essential. For if a thing is not put to use, though rare, it is not valued; if none partake of it, those who would harm it will surely come.\n\nOf old, Duke Ling of Wei heard sagely words yet startled repeatedly; Duke Xiao of Qin listened to lofty discourse yet fell into fearful slumber. To seek the achievements of grand governance and the merits of able ministers while retreating in their pursuit is like racing backward to chase the swift—setting out for Chu yet heading toward Yan.\n\n**On the Pursuit of Rectitude (10)**\n*Baopuzi* states: The Southern Sea draws the tributaries to form its unfathomable depths; the Celestial Gardens pile wood and stone to reach the utmost heights of heaven. A towering edifice pierces the clouds by the accumulation of many beams; a wheel’s curve and a yoke’s straightness leave no part wanting. Thus, when the sagely ministers of the *Yuankai* assisted [King Wen], their transforming virtue reached heaven; when those of pacifying might were complete, the treacherous schemers of the hunt lay dormant. This is how Shun and Yu came to possess the realm without contention, and why Duke Ling of Wei, though arrogant and self-indulgent, did not perish.\n\nWhen many strengths combine, even ten thousand *jun* are not too heavy to lift; when the wisdom of the multitude is employed, even myriad tasks are not too burdensome to bring to order. Thus, the centipede dies yet does not topple, and the state with many scholars falters yet does not fall. Yet a dam’s stitching cannot mend seams, nor can an awl’s drill sever; oxen and horses cannot guard the gate, nor can chickens and dogs pull the carriage. Employ each in its strength, and no task will fail; avoid their shortcomings, and the world will waste no talent.\n\n**On Honoring the Worthy (11)**\n*Baopuzi* states: One who abandons a light boat to cross boundless waters does not see certain passage; one who seeks grand governance without worthy assistance has never heard of success. The great roc’s ascent through the void relies on the strength of its six pinions; the deep-dwelling dragon’s flight to heaven depends on the clouds’ companionship. Thus, summoning the worthy and employing resources are the sovereign’s essential duties; establishing merit and accomplishing deeds are the thoughts of the eminent and talented.\n\nTo delight in order and stability yet neglect the wise is no different from desiring a distant journey while casting aside the *qiji* steed. To lift the obscure from their rustic seclusion, to raise the overlooked from their hidden depths, to assign them tasks commensurate with their talents, and to reward them with emoluments befitting their merits—this is how a lord treats the worthy. To toil day and night in public service, to exhaust heart and strength in the hundred offices, to advance the good and expel the wicked, and to leave no knowledge unapplied—this is how a minister repays his patron.\n\nThe world may have reclusive worthies, but no lord stands alone; scholars may delight in retreat without worry, but a ruler cannot bring order without ministers. Thus, Fu Yue and Lü Shang did not eagerly seek recognition, for their virtue was complete and they held kings and dukes in light esteem. Yet Kings Tang and Wen of Zhou dreamed of them—obtaining the worthy is how great merit is built, for it requires able assistance.\n\nThe peril of life arises within the depths of the palace, and one grows up in...\n\nThe hands of palace women know nothing of the hardships of sowing and reaping, nor do they understand the principles of anxiety and fear. Entrusted with the household and the succession of the ancestral line, they are blind to the rise and fall of the state. Their urgent concern lies in extravagance and waste, their chief pursuit in hunting and feasting, drowning in revelry and music. Hearing lewd sounds, they startle to listen; seeing alluring sights, they shift their gaze. Their ears and eyes are enslaved to these two things alone, their judgment of people clouded, their spirits untrained in the classics. They know only play and amusement to please their hearts and minds, unaware that extraordinary men can secure the altars of state. Rhinoceros horns, elephant tusks, pearls, and jade—though worthless—arrive from ten thousand *li* away, while vessels that could steady a tottering realm, though capable of action, sink into oblivion within the four borders. The twin scourges of illness have already taken hold, yet they seek good physicians; the disaster of a sagging roofbeam has already gathered, yet they ponder schemes—how is this different from digging a well when fire breaks out or surveying fields when hunger strikes?\n\nEven the mediocre and dull cannot be left untended and expected to exhaust their strength—how much less can one hope for sudden usefulness from those without prior cultivation?\n\n**XVI. Employing the Capable**\n\nSome say: \"A tail larger than the body cannot be wagged; a minister more worthy than his lord cannot be employed.\" Thus, forcing down what the mouth cannot contain will surely choke, and entrusting power to one whose talent is unmatched will invite contempt.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* says: How perverse is this claim! In ancient times, Jingzi assumed the reins of state as a mere boy, and the kingdom was saved—thanks to the twenty-five elders who gathered around him. Zijian of Jian rose from commoner status to govern a great commandery, his success due to the many men greater than himself who brought their aid. Duke Huan of Qi killed his brother to seize the throne, his conduct like that of birds and beasts—yet when he unbound his hair, poured libations, and entrusted all affairs to the Master of the Left, he became the first of the hegemons. After Guan Zhong’s death, however, disasters arose in quick succession. When Lu employed Jizi, for over twenty years there were no flawed policies at home and no encroachments abroad; the people, though perishing, suffered no famine or plague—was this not because his talent fell short of his achievements? Yet when he took charge himself, the calamities were as described.\n\nEmperor Gao of Han decided defenses within the palace curtains and determined victory a thousand *li* away—yet he was not the equal of Zhang Liang and Chen Ping. He trained troops in great numbers and grew ever stronger, yet in battle he was no match for Han Xin and Ying Bu. Only by employing them all together did he complete the imperial enterprise. Thus, swift steps and weary marches are not as good as riding a carriage; chasing and pursuing are not as good as borrowing the skills of others. Strong crossbows, though hard to draw, can shatter the sturdy and reach the distant; great ships, though hard to board, can carry heavy loads and cross deep waters. Fierce generals, though hard to control, can break enemy offensives and expand the borders; lofty worthies, though hard to approach, can put the constant norms in order.\n\nIn the past, Duke Ai of Lu was a mediocre ruler, yet Confucius, the supreme sage, did not dare but devote himself wholly to his service. Duke Jing of Qi was of limited ability, yet Yan Ying, a man of great worth, did not dare but offer his utmost sincerity. How could a minister presume to compare his wisdom and strength, his strategic vision and capacity, with those of his lord? Must one wait for a Yao or Shun before serving? What task is not the lord’s? What command is not the people’s? To feel shame that one’s lord does not measure up to Tang and Yu—this is the mindset of the enlightened.\n\n**XVII. Honoring the Worthy**\n\nThe *Baopuzi* says: When You Yu was among the Rong, Duke Mu of Qin was filled with worry; when Dechen was killed, Duke Wen of Jin rejoiced. When Yue Yi departed, Yan fell into ruin; when Fan Li and Wen Zhong entered, Yue became a hegemon. These were men who could break states and destroy families—how could their presence alone be so weighty and their absence so light?\n\nThe tomb of Liu Xiahui still blunted the edge of the Xiongnu’s might—how much more would his presence in the court? The reclusion of Ganku still repelled the attacks of a neighboring state—how much more if he were placed at the right hand of the throne? The mere likeness of Zhi Du made fierce enemies tremble; the corpse of Zhuge Liang still made great states hesitate to act. With such men to repel invaders, the land would surely not be encroached upon; with such men to lead the army, the lord would surely not be humiliated.\n\nThus, the enlightened lord distributes silken gifts in humble alleys, raises the forgotten feathers in withered groves, and sends carriages flying across river bridges. He opens the four gates without tiring, spares no gold or jade, travels a thousand *li* without reluctance, humbles himself without shame, and lowers his words without disgrace—all to make the pursuit of worthies his foremost duty and the acquisition of men of talent his greatest treasure. Those who recommend them receive the highest rewards; those who obstruct them are deemed usurpers of office.\n\nThus, the Duke of Zhou presented his gift in a thatched cottage; the Lord of Shao bowed to Chang Hong in the marketplace. When Master Zou crossed the border, the Lord of Yan swept the path before him; when Zhuangzi had not yet eaten, the Lord of Zhao stood in attendance. Duke Wen of Jin received Hai Tang, yet sat with lowered mats and dared not straighten his posture; the Marquis of Qi visited Jiqiu, though weary from frequent visits, and did not shirk the labor. King Ding received a whipping from Bao Shen; Duke Jian removed his armor before Gong Lu. Though they lowered their lofty status and suppressed their pride to honor the lowly, in the end they only sharpened their vision and extended their sight, lent their ears to broaden their hearing. Like dragons soaring and tigers crouching, it was only fitting.\n\n**XVIII. On Punishment**\n\nBao Puzi says: None do not esteem benevolence, yet none can govern purely by benevolence. None do not despise punishment, yet none can order the people without it. All say that a sagely ruler governs the age, and customs turn as grass bends before the wind; the Dao spreads and transformation ripens, so that peace prevails—yet when punishment is used, I must discuss it thus:\n\nVirtue and instruction are the sacrificial robes of embroidered splendor; punishment and penalties are the armor and helmet that ward off blades. If one were to govern the cunning and violent with virtue and instruction, it would be like facing sharpened halberds in ceremonial vestments. To apply punishment and penalties in a well-ordered age would be like ascending the ancestral temple clad in armor. Thus, benevolence is the instrument for nurturing all things, while punishment is the tool for correcting wrongs. I wish to benefit them, yet they seek to harm; if benevolence fails to reform them, only punishment can halt their transgressions. Punishment serves as the assistant to benevolence—this much is clear.\n\nConsider those who cultivate embryonic breathing, regulate their breath, exhale and inhale, absorb the radiance of the sun, turn their gaze inward, and practice the bear’s climb and the bird’s stretch—these are the arts of long life. Yet they are arduous and slow; few who attempt them succeed, and one in ten thousand may attain mastery. When illness is grave, pain severe, the body weakened, and life in peril, one cannot but attack it with iron and stone, treat it with potent medicines. If one were to abandon the remedies of Bian Que and instead aspire to the Way of Master Red Pine and Wang Qiao, the dead would be legion.\n\nBenevolence in governance is not without its beauty, yet the common people, crafty and deceitful, pursue profit and forget righteousness. If one does not align them with awe, correct them with punishment, and yearn from afar for the customs of Fuxi and Shennong, chaos will become irreparable. Its calamity will be profound, and using killing to halt killing—is this a matter of delight? The creation of the Eight Trigrams exhausts principle and fulfills nature, making clear the use of punishment and imprisonment, as seen in *Shi Ke* bound with ropes and fetters, and in *Xi Kan*, where peril is habituated. Thus, the use of punishment is ancient indeed.\n\nEven in the time of the Yellow Emperor, whose sagely virtue was lofty, he personally led expeditions, fought a hundred battles, left corpses strewn at Zhuolu, and blood flowing at Banquan—yet he could not ensure that his age knew no rebellion. Even when he sheathed his weapons, how could he make all the people good, never commit crimes, and govern themselves? In the flourishing age of Yao and Shun, which mirrored Heaven, punishment was still used: banishment, execution, exile, and exile afar—only then did the world submit. Emperor Wen of Han, whose silence was profound, rivaled the heights of Cheng and Kang—yet he still executed four hundred men, and many died under the lash.\n\nJust as the master carpenter does not abandon the plumb line, so that no wood remains crooked, the enlightened ruler does not abolish execution and punishment, and thus no governance decays into ruin. The Way of Heaven and Earth cannot be purely benevolent: the Azure Yang unfolds the harmony of nurturing and ripening, while the White Autumn enforces the severity of withering and killing. When the melting wind fans, the withered and emaciated revive; when white dew congeals, the luxuriant blossoms wither and fall. Thus, the myriad things flourish, and the year’s work is accomplished. If warmth knew no cold, creeping things would not hibernate, and roots and plants would bloom in winter. If leniency knew no severity, villainy would arise, and sharp weapons would be ever at hand.\n\nTherefore, the enlightened ruler employs clear rewards to uphold the upright and certain punishment to eliminate the perverse. The instruments of encouragement and deterrence are none more essential. To encourage the people, one establishes instruction, balancing leniency and severity so that the timid are not bullied and the resolute do not harm kindness. The crimes subject to the Five Punishments number three thousand—this is to ensure that defenses are not bent. When the Minister of Justice carries out punishment, the ruler does not raise his hand—this is to ensure that the law is not abolished. If defenses are bent, treachery sprouts; if the law is abolished, calamity and chaos multiply.\n\nA ruined state is not without decrees; the trouble lies in their profusion and lack of enforcement. A defeated army is not without prohibitions; the trouble lies in their establishment and lack of observance. Thus, myriad evils spread unchecked, and inferiors grow insolent toward their superiors. Rewards are valued for matching merit, not for their weight; punishments are valued for fitting the crime, not for their cruelty.\n\nIf the whip and rod are abandoned in the household, servants grow lazy; if military campaigns cease in the state, subordinates grow remiss. Affection must await respect, or it will surely fail. Thus, rites are established to exalt virtue, and punishment is created to enforce awe. For virtue requires the support of awe to endure. If Ban Chu were to discard the compass and square, no object would be true to its form; if the enlightened ruler were to release the reins of law, deceit and cunning would run rampant.\n\nThough Yao and Shun’s benevolence was like Heaven, they did not pardon the Four Crimes. Though the Duke of Zhou was kind to his brothers, he did not spare the Two Uncles. Confucius executed Zheng Mao; Emperor Wu of Han killed his nephew—both shed tears, yet the law left them no choice. Thus, executing one to shake ten thousand, sacrificing the few to accomplish the many: like combing tangled hair, the benefit is widespread; like excising an abscess, the preservation is great. Therefore, cauterization and acupuncture, though painful, cannot be halted, for they cure illness. Punishment and law, though they prevent ugliness, cannot be abolished, for they save the state.\n\nAn army of six legions is not necessarily all brave; charging into battle and plunging into fire are things men dread. Yet if one urges them with a serene countenance, few will risk their lives; if one drives them with decapitation, none will fail to fight fiercely. Thus, those who serve with laughter do not match the speed of those who advance at a shout; those who are lured with kindness do not equal the order of those driven by execution. Therefore, though one may be at ease in the deep valley, the law must be strict; though Wei Zi was swift to discard ashes, his punishments were severe. For to use what they fear to restrain what they trifle with is the art of preserving the people whole.\n\nThe art of discerning illness lies in preventing disease before it arises; the essence of governing chaos lies in averting calamity before it comes. If one were to use light punishments to forbid grave crimes, or employ lenient laws to guard great profit, setting them forth in ever-greater detail—yet offenders would only multiply. This is like digging a pit to block the road: not the method of a humane ruler.\n\nThe good governor must first rectify himself to lead others, govern the near to order the distant, and not bend the law to follow his inclinations. He must punish the guilty without pardon—like Shi Que, who sacrificed love to destroy his kin, or Duke Wen of Jin, who suppressed his feelings to execute Jie Zitui. Thus, benevolence is the adornment of governance, while punishment is the bridle and reins of ruling the age. Adornment is not the most urgent thing for the body, yet bridle and reins cannot be absent for even a moment.\n\nIf solemn reverence slackens even slightly, indolence and insolence arise; if majestic severity relaxes for a moment, the multitude of evils takes heart. To fail to anger when anger is due is to make a tiger of a treacherous minister; to fail to kill when killing is due is to unleash a great bandit. Water, long eroding the river and mountains, begins with a handbreadth; a towering tree of a thousand spans starts with a hair’s breadth. A fire kindled by drilling wood can be extinguished with a ladle of water; an unhatched swan’s egg can be crushed in the palm. Yet when it rides the whirlwind and stirs the vast wilds, or beats its six wings to soar into the morning clouds, even the wise and brave cannot control it.\n\nThus, the enlightened ruler governs difficulty while it is easy, eliminates evil while it is still small. He does not boast of his goodness to foster disorder, nor wield the axe with hesitation. Punishment, then, is the sacred instrument of the state, to be wielded by the ruler alone—it cannot be entrusted to others, just as a long sword cannot be grasped by the blade, or a giant fish cannot be drawn from the deep.\n\nThis is the origin of rise and decline, the source of safety and peril. Tian Chang’s usurpation of Qi, the Six Ministers’ partition of Jin, Zhao Gao’s assassination of the Qin emperor, Wang Mang’s seizure of the Han—these all began with the gradual accumulation of frost before the ice hardens.\n\nSome sigh forever by the seashore, others clutch their hearts at Wangyi Palace—calamities that spread to ancestral temples serve as warnings to those yet to come. This arises from admiring empty fame in bygone ages while forgetting the real disasters at hand.\n\nSome argue: \"The rise of penal laws belongs to degenerate times. The Way of establishing people lies only in benevolence and righteousness. If I remain serene, the people will naturally rectify themselves; if I am without desire, the people will naturally return to simplicity.\" The caution against overcooking the fish is not to make it too elaborate. Govern with leniency and love, and you will win the multitude; employ joy in command, and your subordinates will draw near. Thus, Mencius regarded embodying benevolence as peace, while Yang Xiong called Shen Buhai and Han Fei butchers. Excessive reins and tight bridles are not the driving of Master Fu; harsh punishments and severe penalties are not the Way of the Three August Ones and Five Emperors. In the time of Youyu, the hand did not need to wave, the mouth did not need to speak—merely facing south in reverence, and governance flourished in harmony. Fu Sheng merely led by example, strumming his zither and chanting poetry; without descending from his hall, the foolish and wise alike were brought to order.\n\nIf one can enrich the impoverished, lighten taxes, relieve the destitute, promote the overlooked, employ the worthy, encourage agriculture, reduce expenditures, attract the estranged with ritual, and embrace the distant with virtue; if one can mold them with the *Chengjun* and govern them with the *Xiangxu*; if the transformation from above inspires goodness like grass bending before a sudden wind, and those who wash their hearts and reform their faces do so like clear waves rinsing away light dust—then the court will be filled with groups yielding virtue, the countryside will be free of those treading paths of impropriety. The prisons will empty, the weapons of Chu will forever be stilled. Why must rewards and punishments be the means to govern a state?\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Clarify punishments to rectify laws.\" The *Shu* says: \"Pity those in judgment; in court, bestow ranks; in the marketplace, execute punishments.\" This has been so since antiquity. Is it merely that in degenerate times, when benevolence abounds, laws are not established, and when authority is weak, subordinates encroach upon their superiors? If laws are not established, all affairs will be thrown into chaos; if subordinates encroach upon their superiors, rebellious signs will sprout. By the Three Dynasties, the purest essence had already diluted, and the great simplicity further scattered under Qin and Han. The Dao declined in former times, and customs grew shallow in the present. To now seek to restrain and rectify deceit without words, to transform cunning and treachery by relinquishing the reins—this is like riding a galloping horse on a perilous path while discarding the rudder and oars, drifting on a hollow boat to brave the waves; like chasing thieves with bows and courtesies, or slaying Chao Cuo to repel the Seven States; like brandishing weapons to pacify the Red Eyebrows—such measures have never been seen to succeed.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns walked, the Five Emperors trotted, and since the age of hegemons and kings, they have galloped without rest. When governance falters, officials deceive the people with craft, bandits and thieves operate openly. Shaving heads and branding faces are insufficient to punish the shameless; exterminating clans cannot deter covetousness. Multiplying eyes to broaden vision, piling ears to sharpen hearing, raising torches to untangle stagnant affairs, and exhausting the heart to stem the source of treachery—yet still, the marketplace and court echo with sighs, and the frontiers suffer wrongs unheard. Those who wield power to oppress and favor may act beneath the gaze of all; those who harm their families and endanger the state may scheme within their own walls. To govern a decadent age with the Way of Great Heaven, or to quell boiling chaos with a song of uniformity, is to fail to recognize the need to adapt to changing times, to understand the necessity of adjusting gains and losses.\n\nThis is like carving a mark on a boat to seek a lost sword, or shooting an arrow at the sky to hit a target five paces away; like casting aside rhinoceros-hide armor to wade into unfathomable depths, or donning a light robe to endure sweltering heat; like trying to untie a knot by stomping on it, or scratching one’s cheek to relieve an itchy back—nothing could be more foolish. One should first issue commands and only then execute punishments, uncover the truth without delight, so that Bo Shi harbors no resentment for losing his fief, and Yu and Rui know shame without litigation.\n\nIf the violent conceal their nature and wield power without fear, if one tolerates disgrace and lets the weeds grow unchecked, relying on grand words while forgetting the urgency of festering sores—how is this different from one parched with thirst pointing to the distant sea while the water rises to engulf them, or hastily building a boat in the forest as the floodwaters surge? How can one escape the fate of Kuafu or avoid the disaster of drowning?\n\nThe world disparages Shen Buhai and Han Fei’s practical methods while praising Laozi and Zhuangzi’s extravagant theories. Yet in governance, none can do without punishments. Those who kill are pardoned for their deaths; those who injure others are absolved of their crimes—this is like offering mud and broken tiles to starving people in the morning. The words of Daoists may be lofty, but applying them is as impractical as using a *Ganjiang* sword to sew thread, or a giant elephant to catch a mouse; as futile as golden elixirs crossing stormy waves, or jade horses racing a thousand *li*.\n\nIf one were to follow their words, one would burn the stocks and destroy the prisons, abolish officials, erase penal codes, melt down weapons, level city walls, disperse treasuries, destroy tally seals, dismantle barriers, and smash measuring tools. One would blind Li Zhu’s eyes and deafen Shi Kuang’s ears, drifting untethered, returning to nature, untrained and uncaring, forgetting all distinctions between rivers and lakes, court and wilderness. If the world were empty of people, one might never interact until death—such ideas are easy to debate but impossible to practice.\n\nVulgar Confucians only know that Zhou rose through benevolence and Qin fell through severity, yet they fail to realize that Zhou’s success was not purely due to benevolence, nor Qin’s downfall solely due to severity. In ancient times, Zhou employed corporal punishments—amputating feet, slicing noses—and at the covenant of Mengjin, those who arrived late were executed. They swore oaths of collective punishment, yet their actions were not entirely benevolent. By its later years, Zhou neglected laws and played with empty texts; rulers grew tyrannical, edicts failed to reach beyond the cosmos, rituals and music no longer emanated from the throne, and subordinates vied for power like serpents devouring their own tails. They cut off the source and blocked the flow, casting aside caps and tearing robes, some drowning in the Han River, others exiled to Zhi. The defeat of losing authority stemmed from insufficient severity.\n\nQin’s early rise saw officials of talent like Shang Yang and You Yu implementing laws within, while generals like Bai Qi and Wang Jian conquered without. They annexed the weak, attacked the benighted, established dominance, and secured hegemony, swallowing neighbors and crushing rivals, expanding territory and repelling barbarians, transforming like dragons and glaring like tigers—all through clear rewards and certain punishments, laying the foundation for imperial rule. Yet by its later years, Qin grew arrogant in success, indulging in extravagance and excess, compounded by tyranny. They built the Great Wall for ten thousand *li*, constructed over a thousand palaces, amassed bells, drums, and female musicians without moving them. The labor at Mount Li, the taxes of half the land, the conscription of the poor—these, along with the brutality of burying scholars alive, the campaigns against the Xianyun in the north and the Baiyue in the south, mobilized millions of troops for decades. The world mourned separations, every household sighed in resentment; bones piled into mountains, empty sacrifices spread across the fields. Xu Fu departed, and the people wailed in grief; Zhao Gao entered, and the court filled with wolves. The realm sought rebellion, nine out of ten homes stood empty. Was Qin’s downfall truly due to severity? This was Qin gaining through severity, not losing through it.\n\nThe twofold purpose of punishments lies in crafting skillful governance, yet those who employ them to their own detriment wound the state instead. A realm governed by the Dao may be aided by punishments, for they suppress deceit and falsehood, guard against depravity, and correct wayward intent—like a net whose ropes are cut, its mesh disordered. To offend Heaven by misapplying punishments is to court swift peril. Water and fire, too, sustain life yet also destroy it, depending on whether one can wield them. If growths and tumors are left untreated and the arts of Bian Que are not practiced, how can one hope to attain the longevity of Lao Peng? When treacherous factions abound yet no strict laws are enforced to curb their transgressions, the blessings of enduring peace remain unseen.\n\nOne must instead select men like Zhang Tang, entrusting them with the administration of law, and appoint officials like Zhao Yu and Chen Chong, charging them with meticulous scrutiny. Let the enlightened ruler remain vigilant above, while loyal and upright ministers devote themselves below. Upon spying wrongdoing, they strike like hawks and falcons seizing sparrows; at the first sign of disorder, they uproot it like weeding a field, cutting away the foul and overgrown. If rewards are never misapplied and executions never miss their mark, then the path to Great Peace need not be trodden anew—transgressions will become rare. Yet to abolish punishments and achieve order? I dare not affirm such a claim.\n\nSome may argue: \"Are punishments not indeed a means to aid instruction, promote goodness, and restrain wickedness?\" As for the corporal punishments of antiquity—might they be restored?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replies: Why should they not? In former times, the Zhou employed corporal punishments for seven hundred years, while the Han abolished them, yet their dynasty did not endure as long. They replaced such punishments with flogging and caning, resulting in many deaths—outwardly a lighter penalty, but in truth, a means of killing. When a crime was too severe for a non-capital sentence, the only recourse was penal servitude, flogging, or caning. If a general amnesty were declared, the offender would suffer no lasting harm, merely shaving the hair of one reborn or striking wounds already healing—hardly sufficient to deter crimes deserving of death.\n\nBy abolishing corporal punishments, no intermediate penalty remains between death and lesser sentences. Thus, those not condemned to death must be punished with penal servitude, flogging, or caning, making it impossible to calibrate severity. Moreover, crimes are infrequent, and when they occur, execution breeds deep resentment, while flogging breeds little. Many would rather risk such penalties. Without corporal punishments, crimes just short of capital offenses often go unpunished.\n\nIf, however, corporal punishments were substituted for death in cases other than treason, rebellion against ruler or kin, military offenses in wartime, or murder by one’s own hand, they would suffice as deterrence. The punished could still perform labor, their lives spared, though their bodies would bear lifelong marks. The sight of such mutilation would chill the hearts of all, instilling fear in those yet to offend and serving as a warning to future generations—far more effective than execution. Though execution is severe, the condemned are buried after three days, their fate unknown to most, unseen by many.\n\nCorporal punishments, however, serve as enduring admonitions. During the Wei dynasty, this matter was debated repeatedly. Eminent scholars, well-versed in governance, universally agreed that corporal punishments should be restored, though dissenting opinions were raised, none held merit. Emperor Wu of Wei concurred but hesitated, for the frontiers remained unsettled, and distant peoples, unaccustomed to unified rule, might misinterpret the amputation of limbs or the severing of ears and noses as cruel tyranny. Thus, he temporarily suspended the practice, awaiting the pacification of all quarters.\n\nThe learned Yang Xiong also advocated for the restoration of corporal punishments, yet their abolition had persisted for so long that those who sat in counsel did not deem it urgent.\n\n**Master Baopu, Outer Chapters, Scroll One**\n*From the Siku Quanshu, \"Baopuzi Inner and Outer Chapters,\" Category: Masters, Daoist Works*\n\n**Scroll Two**\n*By Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty*\n\n**On the Examination and Recommendation of Officials (Shenju, Fifteenth)**\n\nMaster Baopu said: The towering heights of Mount Hua and Mount Heng reach the heavens because their foundations are deep. The resplendent achievements of Yao and Shun were made possible by their worthy ministers. Even with the hands of Sun Yang, without the hooves of a *qiji*, one cannot traverse a thousand *li*. Even with talents steeped in antiquity, without capable aides to execute tasks, one cannot bring order to the myriad affairs.\n\nThough a ruler’s wisdom may rival the sun and moon, and his divine insight perceive the unseen, the ten thousand threads of governance cannot be managed alone, nor can trivial matters be personally overseen. He must rely on eyes to broaden his vision and ears to extend his hearing. Truly, he requires ministers to assist and support him. Thus, the sage-kings of old all rooted their hearts in seeking worthies, making the recommendation of talent their foremost duty. They bestowed jade and silk upon recluses in their hills and forests, dispatched carriages to remote valleys, labored in the search for men, and found ease in employing their abilities. From the lofty halls to the lowliest posts, all—whether discussing the Dao or governing the state—were entrusted with office. Through reverent self-restraint, they achieved effortless rule; through the suspension of punishments, their transformative influence spread without bounds, and the myriad regions knew peace.\n\nOfficials are established and duties assigned as one constructs a house: if a single component is unfit, collapse is inevitable. Yet those who have not yet offered tribute or been recommended are measured by the Four Categories, the Three Affairs, and the Nine Ranks. From these, only the most outstanding and exceptional are selected. But by the late Han, during the reigns of Emperors Huan and Ling, power had slipped from the imperial house into the hands of treacherous ministers. The net of governance was full of holes, the dikes had burst, the wind of virtue had withered, and instruction had faltered. Integrity was suppressed, flattery exalted; those who trod the Way were demoted, while the wealthy and powerful advanced. Competition became the custom, shamelessness the norm. Some offered bribes to sell themselves, others peddled letters of recommendation from influential men. Some relied on the prominence of fathers or elder brothers to secure appointments, while others, through years of bowing and scraping, were eventually recruited.\n\nWhen the scales of selection are unbalanced, weights and measures become confused. When measuring vessels are crooked, quantities are muddled. Without clear standards, right and wrong blur; when the rules are skewed, the impure proliferate. To govern with such men is to invite cruelty and rapacity. They extort and amass wealth to recoup the cost of buying office, and once installed in court, their misrule surpasses tangled silk. They promote the mediocre and incompetent as their clique, and how can one expect the grass to bend before the wind when such men are in charge? Is this not like demanding luminous pearls from worthless shards or pure tones from an untuned instrument?\n\nHow can we fail to purify the turbid, let the light sink, sift the sand, and refine the good from the bad? How can we not tighten the methods of rigorous examination, heighten the barriers against greed, and fear the calamities that arise from such corruption? In ancient times, when feudal lords recommended men of talent, those who chose well were deemed meritorious and rewarded with higher rank and expanded territory. Those who chose poorly were deemed at fault and demoted or stripped of land. Yet even then, they could not escape the *Book of Songs*’ censure of \"great carriages\" and \"eating without labor,\" nor the praise for those who \"cut timber by the river\" and \"set traps for hares.\" How much worse, then, is the crime of recommending the unworthy or the peril of receiving those unfit for office? Once the scales are misaligned, how can the balance of many and few be restored?\n\nThe solitary and lofty, those who conceal their talents awaiting their worth, languish in obscurity and hardship. The petty and frivolous, who curry favor through social connections, seize opportunities and rise swiftly. When owls and vultures soar, mandarin ducks retreat into seclusion; when jackals and wolves dominate the roads, qilin flee. Promote the good and teach the people, and the unvirtuous will distance themselves. When the treacherous and false are honored, the heroic and upright withdraw. Those of noble character disdain association with the base and are ashamed to join the ranks of the gluttonous. If appointments are uniformly misguided, the worthy will seal their talents in silence. When the worthy seal their talents, villains will draw one another in. When villains draw one another in, the path of petty men lengthens. When the path of petty men lengthens, *taowu* and other monsters stand shoulder to shoulder. Thus, songs of praise fall silent, and cries of resentment rise in a clamor.\n\nMen of towering talent, confident in their abilities, bend or stand, speak or remain silent, as fate dictates. They entrust success and failure, poverty and prosperity to nature. How can they avoid falling behind the factions of the powerful and submitting to the strong? Men of extraordinary virtue move only when propriety demands; they stand firm as mountains and still as deep pools. Few recognize them, while the clamorous and ambitious slander and obstruct them. Thus, even a ruler who longs for worthies may never learn where true talent lies. Those who cherish the Dao wish to serve but find no path. Though they possess the talents of Hou Ji and Xie, and the vast capacities to surpass their age, they remain mired in obscurity until death, never gaining rank or office. Meanwhile, those with factions and power gather like scales on a fish. With too few men for too many posts, how can one avoid scooping up and employing even the mediocre?\n\nDuring the reigns of Emperors Ling and Xian, eunuchs held power, and a cabal of villains wielded authority, endangering the loyal and good. In the imperial court, appointments were mismanaged; in the provinces and commanderies, recommendations were treated lightly. When appointments are mismanaged above, governors and prefects are unfit for their posts. When recommendations are treated lightly below, the worthy among the *xiucai* and *xiaolian* are not selected. Thus, the people of the time said: *\"Recommend a* xiucai *who knows no books; examine* xiaoxing *and find the father living apart. The pure and white are muddied like sludge; the finest generals retreat like chickens.\"* They also said: *\"In ancient times, men studied the classics diligently to advance; today, they seek office to avoid work.\"* Such was the depth of their indignation.\n\nAt that time, offices were put up for sale like goods in a marketplace. Those vying for positions bought them like merchants. Those with bribes advanced without qualification; those with empty fists were recruited on sight. The more one paid, the higher the office; the less one paid, the lower the rank. Thus, the Eastern Gardens amassed wealth from selling offices, and Cui Lie was mocked for the stench of copper. The ruler set the example, and the ministers followed suit, exceeding him in excess. Flatterers and favorites monopolized discussions; relatives and hometown acquaintances controlled evaluations. The Ministry of Personnel and the Bureau of Merit became brokers, each demanding their price. How could the poor and upright hope for advancement?\n\nThis was the state of affairs, yet the distinction between right and wrong remained as stark as ice and charcoal. Those who hated integrity despised those not of their faction; those who inverted standards feared others’ judgment. Those who advanced through improper means dreaded unfavorable talk. Thus, they conspired to fabricate slander, heaping false accusations upon the virtuous, creating blemishes where none existed, and none dared to rescue or promote them. As a result, Zeng Shen and Min Sun were slandered like Prince Shang; Confucius and Mozi were defamed like Robber Zhi. Those who cherished integrity and upheld principle perished in the mire, while the cunning and deceitful soared like rainbows. Could one not tremble at the calamities that stem from such a system?\n\nYet the shallow-minded common folk, unable to distinguish between right and wrong, call those who uphold the Dao \"sunken in obscurity\" and deem those who tread the proper path \"adept at shifting with the times.\" How can those who drift with the wind and flow with the current ever return to the labor of virtue or the toil of learning? Thus, all abandon the wearisome task of self-discipline and rush toward the swift rewards of bribery. This is indeed the very reason the Han dynasty collapsed—a lesson future generations must heed deeply.\n\nSome may say: \"Your critique of the Han’s late-era examination system truly diagnoses its ills. Now, those who wish to avoid past mistakes and steer clear of ruinous paths have adjusted their methods to prevent laxity and corruption. Yet just as the rustic songs of Pu Shang and Ba people have supplanted the proper music of contentment, and as minor ailments of the skin go untreated until they fester, how can one not exert effort to remedy this? There are scholars of fine appearance and noble bearing, their dignified presence overflowing, yet they harbor emptiness within, their substance insufficient. If one judges by appearance alone, worthy talent may not be found; if one tests them gradually, there is no time for haste. What then is to be done?\"\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replies: \"To know others is wisdom—even sages find it difficult. If all governors could discern true talent before its use and ensure the constancy of their nature and conduct, it would indeed be no easy task. Yet if they collectively set aside private interests, exhaust their wisdom, remain unmoved by profit or desire, and refuse to bend to favoritism, then those they wish to recommend must be scrutinized with careful thought, investigated thoroughly, their reputations examined alongside their conduct, discrepancies weighed to expose false adornments. Let their clans praise their filial piety and brotherly love, let their villages attest to their trustworthiness and integrity. If they have held minor office, let their loyalty, purity, and administrative skill be proven—even a single brocade strip reveals craftsmanship, and a mouse’s gnawing tests courage.\n\nFurthermore, all candidates for recommendation and examination should, as before, be tested on the classics and required to compose policy responses. If their answers are fraudulent, they must be permanently barred from office, punished with prohibition from service. If their responses are inadequate, governors and prefects who endorse them should be dismissed; those with many failures should be demoted, while those with few should be restricted in promotion. If one accepts bribes and recommends the unworthy, upon discovery and verification, they shall be stripped of rank, permanently barred from office, and no amnesty shall pardon them. Those they recommend shall share their punishment.\n\nIf this system is enforced for a year or two, many will cease seeking recommendation, and it will become clear how long the empire’s examination system has been imprecise. Beyond this, those who cultivate virtue and diligently study will surely increase.\n\nMoreover, for all officials in office, those guilty of public offenses shall be dealt with according to the law. Those whose crimes of greed and corruption do not warrant death shall, even after completing their sentences or receiving amnesty, be permanently barred from office—lesser offenders for twenty years. Thus, even the corrupt will be transformed into Boyi and Shuqi. But if officials who amass mountains of illicit wealth upon discovery plead for mercy, escape punishment, and within days return to office, even Zeng Shen and Shi Yu will become Robber Zhi.\n\nIf this is so, then even if all recommended scholars are qualified, they will not tolerate the misconduct of their superiors.\"\n\nSome may ask: \"One who speaks well may not act well. Even if a candidate excels in classical examinations and policy responses, how can one be certain of their administrative ability?\"\n\nThe *Baopuzi* answers: \"In ancient times, archery was used to select men—how much more so the mastery of classical arts? If we abandon testing, what other method is superior? This is the way.\"\n\nFor lush grasses do not flourish in barren soil, nor do giant fish arise in shallow waters; maxims are not spoken from the mouths of mediocre men, nor do lofty writings fall from the brushes of the dull-witted. Thus, perusing the *Hongfan*, one recognizes that Jizi possessed the instrument for ordering the world; examining the *Nine Strategies*, one sees that Master Fan harbored the art of governing the state; studying the writings of Guan Zhong, one understands his capacity to restore order from chaos; and reading the texts of Shen Buhai, one perceives his mastery of the Dao of hegemony and kingship.\n\nNow, if candidates for filial piety and incorruptibility must be tested on the classics without error, and if cultivated talents must respond to policy questions without missing the intent, then they cannot be obscured or concealed. Even fine generals and high-ranking officers, selected for their courage and martial prowess, are further tested in archery—how much more so for scholars of the literary arts? Even if one cannot guarantee that all selected will be worthy and capable, it is surely better than not testing them at all. Moreover, if this single measure is implemented, all those who ought to be recommended for office throughout the realm will dare not neglect their studies. This one provision alone would greatly benefit the cultivation of customs and education.\n\nIf the realm fears the consequences of reckless recommendations, if all men abandon their pursuit of fortune by chance and return to the foundation of learning, then the Dao of the Ru will flourish, private bribes will gradually cease, extraordinary talents can be employed, and offices will no longer lie vacant.\n\nSome may say: \"Sir, you seek to hasten the laws of recommendation, but the punishment of lifelong禁锢 is too harsh and severe, and many will fear it. Tight reins and frequent checks are what even Bo Le would not employ; strict laws and severe punishments are what virtuous governance shuns.\"\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replies: \"Medicines that nourish the bones and replenish the flesh are excellent for nurturing the body and prolonging life, yet they cannot save one from drowning or heatstroke in an emergency. Governance that emphasizes tolerance and forbearance may befit a simple and honest people, but it is insufficient to rescue a state in decline and chaos. When tigers and wolves press near, if one does not brandish a spear or unsheathe a sword but instead strums the zither and recites poetry, I have yet to see how one’s life can be preserved. When flames engulf a house, if one does not rush to pour water but instead bows and circles in ceremony, I have yet to see how the fire will extinguish itself. To discuss this with those who wish to sell offices is like debating the capture of thieves with Robber Zhi.\"\n\nThe *Baopuzi* says: \"Now, under the unified rule of all under heaven, where the nine regions share a common wind, the king’s institutions and decrees ought to be uniform. Even small measures of weight and volume must not vary from place to place—how much less can the standards for men of talent be left unchecked and inconsistent? Though Jiangbiao is distant, lying near the sea’s edge, it has been steeped in the Dao and transformed by culture for over a thousand years. Though it was once briefly severed for less than a hundred years, the pursuit of Ru learning was never abandoned. Only because its territory is smaller than the Central States is the number of its scholars not equal in size—yet in virtue, conduct, talent, and learning, its finest, such as Ziyu and Ren An, are no less than those of the Central States.\n\nIn the early years of the Wu king, those recommended as candidates were exempted from testing due to their adherence to the established standards. Now, as the era of Great Peace has neared forty years, they are still not tested. This is why the Ru learning of the Southeast has declined compared to the past. Such a policy treats them no differently than those in barbarian dress—it does not distinguish them. Moreover, even the noble-minded treat others with ritual propriety—how much more so should those who are as kind and joyful as parents? Laws that invite calamity and decrees that harm transformation—these are what we speak of.\n\nIf candidates for recommendation are no longer tested, they will surely adorn themselves and vie for empty reputations. Who will then willingly open a book and study? This is what is meant by ‘enriching them only to ruin them.’ There are those with a natural love for antiquity, who delight in the arts and literature, who do not serve for salary, who savor the Dao and forget poverty—men like Gao Qing and Zhou Shenglie, whose learning is profound yet who do not seek office, who follow the Way and spurn glory and profit. Such men are one in ten thousand. As for those like Ning Yue, Ni Kuan, and Huang Ba, their diligent self-discipline in the classics was not innate but arose from suffering, hardship, and distress, through which they sought to elevate themselves by means of classical arts. Had it not been for the age of Emperor Wu of Han, even men like Zhu Maichen and Yan Zhu would not have read books.\n\nNow, if the path to wealth and honor is readily available, and those who happen to have some inclination toward learning yet lack a natural love for it, how will they willingly endure hardship, perform menial tasks as students, travel far to seek teachers, and inquire after the Dao? In times of war, martial prowess is prized and literary arts decline; common men regard Ru scholars as servants and slaves, and view the classics and treatises as worthless weeds and dust. Why is this? Because their reputation has been tarnished. This is the reason.\"\n\nTo refrain from using analogies is like selling ceremonial caps to the people of Yue or offering centipede-snake talismans in the Central Plains. Now, if the system of examinations and evaluations were uniformly implemented far and wide, many would surely carry their satchels a thousand *li* to seek teachers and friends, redirecting the expenses of gifts and bribes to purchase books and records—this would not take a full day to unfold.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: \"Scholars of talent and learning who are fit for the *xiucai* and *xiaolian* examinations are already rare enough. If, in the present age, officials were appointed as they were in the reigns of Emperors Huan and Ling—where those in charge of the imperial secretariat did not prioritize wealth and favor—then even those who could recite all the classics from memory without error would still be wronged and slandered, prevented from advancing.\"\n\nI have long lamented that those in authority have not taken sufficient measures to prevent such abuses. My suggestion is this: for those to be tested in the imperial examinations next year, this year should see the appointment of learned officials and talented scholars to devise comprehensive preventive measures. All drafts should be collected and sealed within the palace halls. At the time of the examination, the questions should be swiftly distributed, and all personal connections and influences thereby severed. Those responsible for overseeing the process should be gathered in one place, with high-ranking officials from the central government personally supervising and strictly prohibiting any collusion. All communication and entry or exit should be forbidden until the examination is complete. Violators should be punished without pardon. If such measures are implemented and entrusted to reliable hands, the loopholes will be sealed.\n\nA wise ruler relies on the impossibility of deceiving himself, not on others’ unwillingness to deceive him. Why should he feel shame in enforcing such strict regulations?\n\nIf the examination system for the classics is established, then the empire cannot but establish official academies, and people will naturally devote themselves to study. During the Han dynasty, the Four Categories of Examination included a clear understanding of laws and ordinances as a path to officialdom. Yet today, those in office—regardless of rank—are largely ignorant of the law. Some legal texts are obscure and difficult to comprehend, while petty clerks, often obstinate, are left to adjudicate cases. Thus, matters of life and death are entrusted to the frivolous, and the lives of the common people are placed in the hands of the uninformed. When officials themselves do not know the law, they are deceived by their subordinates without realizing it. Those who draft judgments are often muddled, unable to discern whether a case conforms to the law or not. They do not inquire nor refer it to the proper authority, but instead decide matters by whim, stumbling and erring without regard for the law. If upright and capable officials were all required to pass an examination on the laws and ordinances—just as they are tested on the classics—and those who scored highest were appointed according to their talent and rank, then the empire would surely see fewer officials who manipulate the law and fewer unjust verdicts.\n\n**On Interpersonal Relations (Section Sixteen)**\nThe *Baopuzi* states: I hold that friendships should not be tainted by superficiality or insincerity. Yang Yunyou criticized those who, though equal in status, reputation, lineage, or age, diverge in conduct and aspirations, and with such men I have never associated. Some flaunt their seniority or stride ahead with lofty disdain; others neglect old friendships that have declined or dismiss promising newcomers as unrefined. Some judge others by rank rather than virtue; others, though talented, wise, pure in conduct, and noble in character, are overlooked because they have not encountered a true patron. Meanwhile, those who happen to rise in rank or gain office—though dull and mediocre—are inevitably sought after. Such men may command fleeting influence, making insects soar and sparrows reach the heavens, wielding power like a blade or a measure to dispense fortune and misfortune. When they favor someone, they exalt them with dazzling splendor; when they withdraw, they leave them withered like plants in spring. I am too constrained and ashamed to share the world with them, whether in adversity or prosperity.\n\nYet frivolous men, lacking any sense of integrity, never reproach themselves. With unwavering resolve, they rush through the night to guard the gates of the powerful, fawning and flattering with obsequious words and pleasing expressions. They carry wine and gifts, seeking favor through persistent toil. Even after long effort, they may still be spurned, only to resort to intermediaries to secure an introduction. When accepted, their joy surpasses that of a prisoner granted amnesty; when rejected, their dejection exceeds that of one stricken by illness or bereavement. But success and failure are matters of fate, and the Dao values uprightness. Prosperity and adversity are left to nature—why lament the paths one takes? Are such petty men not contemptible?\n\nHuman dispositions differ, yet how far apart are they truly? I often sigh and feel shame for them. Once, Zhuangzi saw the multitude of followers in Zhuangzi’s retinue and discarded his remaining fish. I, too, lament that worldly men do not eagerly seek worthy connections. Gazing at those who gallop through the dust, I see they do not strive to cultivate virtue or seek improvement within themselves. Instead, they chase after influential friends to form cliques, believing no principle more essential and no urgency greater in the world. Those who stand firm and independent are dismissed as stingy and inept, while those who grovel with servile deference are praised for understanding the ways of the world. Such customs have become ingrained, and none escape their sway—how lamentable!\n\nSome men, though morally deficient and high in rank, are swollen with arrogance and avarice. At the mention of wealth, they startle and tremble; when they encounter extraordinary men, they doze off. Threadbare scholars in coarse robes, carrying satchels—though their learning shines and their wisdom runs deep—are treated as dust and weeds, never welcomed. Yet men like Cheng Zheng and Wangsun Jia, who ride in fine carriages, wear luxurious robes, and carry gold and jade, though ignorant of even basic propriety, are met with haste, their food spat out and hair grasped in eagerness. I regret not holding office, for without the axe and its handle, I cannot purge the state of such filth, banishing them to the four frontiers or casting them into the northern wastes. Though they may blaze with power, wielding authority like a blade or a measure, their influence enough to move mountains and uproot seas, their breath enough to lift one from the mire to the clouds—if they come to my gate, I have no time for them. Yet many lower themselves, forcing smiles and crawling forward to seek their favor, hoping for some benefit. Alas, how vast is the gulf between the intentions of the living and the unworthy!\n\nI live in a sagely age yet remain mired in obscurity and lowliness. Looking back, I see none who once shared my path, and now, gazing ahead, I cannot catch up. Is there no reason for this? Yet if my nature cannot endure it, I must follow my own inclinations—this is a principle I cannot abandon.\n\nSome may object: Times change, and the world shifts; ancient and modern pursuits differ. One must act according to the present, establish a name, and achieve success. Those who carry gold and jade through peril are like those who entrust themselves to a light boat. The phoenix that gathers in the empyrean relies on the power of flight. The fragrance of orchids is the work of the clear wind. The reclusive scholar who rises from obscurity is aided by a true patron. Now, sir, you insist on befriending only those of pure conduct and refined character, favoring only the most discerning. Alone and aloof, you lose the company of your peers, making enemies of the world and drawing the scorn of the vulgar. How does this align with the lofty principle of harmonizing with the world while preserving one’s integrity?\n\nIf you compare wisdom before befriending, even a commoner in a thatched hut would not deign to associate with the noble Duke of Zhou. If you measure talent before associating, even Confucius would have no disciples entering his inner chamber.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replies: I have heard that those who choose friends carefully do not lose worthy companions, while those who form indiscriminate bonds often regret it. Thus, the sages of old selected friends before forming ties, not the other way around. Your argument is a worldly calculation; my resolve is the resolve of a reclusive scholar.\n\nYou speak of jade floating and birds soaring—all have their causes, and indeed, this may be a distinct principle, a doctrine of its own. Yet I would rather be an uncarried treasure, an unsoaring roc, an unscented orchid. Moreover, is not the scholar diminished by possessing the luster of night-shining pearls, the vastness of the sky-spanning wings, the fragrance of everlasting blossoms, or the immortality of the orchid?\n\nFurthermore, when fame exceeds reality and rank surpasses talent, those who hold such positions seldom escape calamity or disgrace—how then can associating with them be considered honor or fortune? By this reasoning, even if one befriends them and gains success, it is not truly worthy; if one shelters under them and errs, it is like relying on a rotten tree to brace a collapsing beam. If they cannot even prevent their own downfall, how can they save me from a shattered skull?\n\nI have heard that the true man, self-sufficient and beyond external things, regards the common crowd as if pressed into unavoidable contact—though they number in the thousands, they are but lice infesting his robes or wens clustering on his body. To lose them, though they number in the tens of thousands, is like flying dust leaving Mount Song or withered branches falling from Deng Forest. How can their presence be counted a gain, or their absence felt as a loss?\n\nAs for friendship, it must be founded on those who are upright, candid, and learned—who correct one’s errors, reject falsehoods, speak without being asked, and make no excuses even in death; whose bond remains unbroken through winter’s cold and summer’s heat. Yet such people are not easily found. Some diverge in speech and path, others shift in love and hate; some unite in prosperity and part in decline, while others forget loyalty at the sight of profit. In today’s world, such friendships are like birds and fish forming bonds or ice and charcoal sharing a vessel—how can their union endure?\n\nEven between father and son, bound by nature, preferences should align, yet Zizheng and Zijun differed in judgment, and Boqi of Nanshan disputed with his father, their faces turned away and hearts divided. Such discord has existed since ancient times. To lump them all together—is this not difficult indeed?\n\nThe common crowd forms bonds without regard for shared purpose, chasing fame and following power. They flock when warm and scatter when cold, refuse to correct faults, and ignore those lost in delusion. When profit arises, they seize it alone without sharing; when harm comes, they flee to save themselves without aid. When opportunity favors, they take first without yielding; when danger looms, they betray others to secure themselves. With friends like these, it would be better to have none. The world is not entirely devoid of suitable companions, but those who bring benefit are few, while those who create burdens are many.\n\nDiscerning others is a skill even the greatest sages find difficult. Yet those of limited talent, lacking in judgment, seek to broaden their circle, hoping all will stand firm through peril and hardship, bearing each other’s burdens through adversity. I have never seen such abundance. Even searching for flawless jade atop a mound or phoenixes in a wren’s nest would not be as hard.\n\nI do not dare claim that beyond the southern slopes of Lantian or within the cinnabar caves of Danxue, no such people exist—only that they are rare indeed. When natures differ, gold sinks while feathers float; when aspirations clash, fire rises while water descends. Even the craft of Creation or the skill of the Great Potter cannot force alignment—how then can it be compelled?\n\nAs for myself, I am by nature dull and slow, further burdened by a heaven-given laziness. Games of skill, gambling, and all frivolous amusements I despise; racing, hunting, and idle wandering I do not pursue. I have no taste for jesting or banter—all these are the pleasures of the age, yet I lack them entirely. Thus, my close companions are few.\n\nMoreover, I cling to honesty and freely speak my loyal counsel. Few willingly accept bitter medicine, and I further expect them to heed my advice, to curb their recklessness, to temper their excesses—all things the common crowd finds displeasing. To cast aside one’s true nature for hollow conformity, to force oneself into the mold of others’ affections—this I cannot bear. Yet if I persist unchanged, can I not be called blind to the times and inept in great matters?\n\nIf friendships do not endure, if bonds form only to break, both parties earn a reputation for inconstancy and lose the beauty of a lasting union. When closeness fades, affection turns to resentment; when distance grows, suspicion takes root. This is the natural course—how can one not choose carefully?\n\nTo raise a cup, clap a back, clasp hands—these fleeting moments may multiply in number, yet I fear they cannot endure in wholeness.\n\nSome may ask: \"Then should one have no companions at all?\"\nI reply: How could this be so? Those who fear water need not abandon boats and oars; those who dread injury need not forsake axes and adzes. The Way of companionship has been esteemed since ancient times. If Heaven and Earth do not join, there is no great harmony; if high and low do not unite, their aspirations diverge. Without great harmony, the two qi remain divided; when aspirations diverge, the world has no true states.\n\nYet while beginnings are easy, endings prove difficult. The danger lies in binding oneself to the wrong person, squandering the great for petty strife. The *Book of Changes* praises \"gold and orchid,\" and poetry sings of \"a hundred friends.\" Though one may have brothers, they are not like friends born of shared purpose. The Three Beneficial Bonds were cherished even by the greatest sages. Disciples honor their masters, harsh words do not arise, and Guan Zhong escaped execution to establish the Five Hegemons—all through the power of friendship. Ziyuan abandoned his post as village chief to ride in the vermilion carriage, likewise by the strength of his companions.\n\nA single flute cannot produce the harmony of *Shao* and *Xia*; a lone hue cannot complete the splendor of dragon-embroidered robes. One flavor cannot blend the savor of Yi’s cauldron; a solitary tree cannot become the lush forest of Deng. The lofty gardens of Penglai reach the heavens through the accumulation of countless stones; the vast Southern Sea swells with the confluence of a thousand streams. When the bright mirror is raised, even a tilted cap is revealed; when Xihe’s light shines, even crooked shadows are exposed. Only when the archer’s bow is well-strung do the ailments of misdirected arrows vanish.\n\nWhen true friends unite, the Way of assisting virtue is perfected. The enlightened understand this well. In their aspirations, they carefully choose those who surpass them; in their humbler associations, they discern those of like mind. When together, they discourse on the Dao and advance in power; when apart, they harmonize their hearts like paired wings. In times of prosperity, they collaborate in worldly affairs; in times of peace, they refine their understanding of principle. In peril, they succor one another. They would feel shame if their praise of one another were confined to two distant lands, lest Wangsun and Gongyu alone be celebrated for their cap-brushing friendship. Only then is the Way of old companionship truly esteemed.\n\nYet discerning true from false is no easy task. The rise of power and profit breeds shifts in allegiance; accumulated slander erodes even neck-severing pacts, and gradual corrosion dissolves the firmest bonds of glue and lacquer. Thus, some lament the loss of former affection, while others bear grudges over trivial slights, forgetting past ties. The friendship of Yuanbo and Juqing shines only in antiquity, while the betrayals of Zhang Er and Chen Yu recur even today—a lamentable pattern. The phoenix does not perch on the same branch as the owl; the qilin does not herd with wolves. Clear springs do not mingle with muddy torrents; the wise and enlightened do not dwell with the deceitful and benighted. Why? Because gradual contamination corrupts, and the straight path, when violently coerced, invites harm.\n\nSomeone asked, \"May I inquire how to preserve the Way of perfect friendship?\"\n\nThe Master of Plainness replied: \"When a gentleman severs ties, he does so without malice—how could he then speak ill of a former friend? He would sacrifice his life for a friend—how could he compete over rank or status? In good friendship, there is intimacy without disrespect, harmony without conformity. If a friend errs, he admonishes him with solemnity; if he is told of his own faults, he corrects them without hesitation. He does not withhold counsel to avoid offending, nor reject advice to spare his own ears. He does not use clever rhetoric to excuse wrongs, nor flowery words to gloss over faults. He does not feign agreement while harboring discord, nor conceal true feelings behind a false smile. He does not flatter to his face and despise behind his back. He does not resent another’s superiority but guards against his own shortcomings, drawing out their strengths while concealing their faults. Externally, he is free from scheming slander; internally, he sheds the burden of rivalry. Only then is the bond of *Lu Ming* preserved and the sting of *Fa Mu* silenced.\n\nYet some treat friendship lightly, forming bonds without weight, deepening ties without difficulty, only to thin them just as easily. What begins like shadow and echo ends as distant as Shen and Chen. The closest camaraderie turns to bitter enmity; clasped hands become sworn foes. Such misfortune leaves no path for redress.\n\nIn the decline of the Han, the reins of governance slackened, and public duty waned. The customs of contention flourished, where defying the times was deemed purity, and saving the world was seen as shame. The great bonds of hierarchy and propriety collapsed. Those in office neglected their duties, chasing superficial acclaim over substance. State affairs were abandoned for hollow praise; corruption accumulated, yet their merits were lauded. None failed to spur their carriages, racing through frost and heat to the gates of the powerful, adorning their names with empty splendor in the mouths of the influential, securing undeserved ranks from the merchants of office. When desires clashed, they turned on one another in mutual slaughter.\n\nThus, Gongshu Chang, distressed by such decay, lacked the strength to correct it but could not bear to witness it. In outrage, he penned his treatise, barred his door, and severed all ties. This was indeed a passionate response to the times—yet in overcorrecting, he strayed from the eternal teachings. One should simply distance oneself from corrupt factions and guard against the roots of flattery. Why must one strip naked to shame the extravagant or starve to mock the gluttonous?\n\nIf repeated admonitions go unheeded and great disorder ensues, then the abandonment of ritual and propriety may be justified.\n\n---\n\n**On Recognizing Limitations (Chapter Seventeen)**\nThe Master of Plainness said: The finest steed may gallop across the plains, outstripping the sun, yet cannot tread upon ice to cross deep waters. The fierce tiger may roar like thunder and rend its prey, yet cannot soar through clouds to ascend the heavens. The great roc cannot flap its wings within a cage, nor can the swift sparrowhawk strike like lightning at the banquet table. All things have their limits—so too do people.\n\nThus, one who harmonizes yin and yang may not excel in all virtues; one who masters the great classics may falter in minor details. Hui Shi, paragon of prime ministers, could not command a boat to brave the waves. Emperor Gaozu, peerless in martial prowess, could not manage his household or regulate his conduct. Han Xin, master strategist, could not tend to farming or trade to escape hunger and cold. Zhou Bo, pillar of the state, could not answer questions on finances or legal disputes.\n\nIf we discard the long for the short, then the talents of Yi Zhi and Fu Yue would go unused. If we demand perfection in both grand and trivial matters, then the achievements of those who govern the world and aid its people would never be recognized.\n\nHeaven cannot level its northwest; earth cannot elevate its southeast. The sun and moon cannot illuminate dark crevices; the wind cannot stir waves in a well. A toothpick cannot match the pine or oak in length; an ear pick cannot rival the rafters in size. A pellet of mud can fell a bird worth a thousand gold, while a needle of a few fen outstrips a long sword in sewing. Why must one harness a great elephant to catch a rat or enlist the roc to herald the dawn?\n\nThus, Jiang Ziya sold fish without success before finding his master in King Wen and Wu. Jiang Sheng was scorned in a hundred villages before standing unmatched among the Three Huai.\n\n---\n\n**On Selecting Talent (Chapter Eighteen)**\nThe Master of Plainness said: Ornate prose is not for the blind to appreciate; extraordinary talent is not for the shallow to recognize. If one’s gaze cannot reach others, then dragon-embroidered robes and plain hemp are valued the same. If one’s judgment cannot discern, then the brilliant and the mediocre are judged alike.\n\nWhat the eye does not see, the spirit does not embrace. Where no comparison is made, harm inevitably follows. Moreover, love and hate, approval and disdain, have never been uniform across time. Customs shift, and the same object may command a high price in one era and be worthless in another. The jade pendant of the Xia sovereigns, once prized beyond cities, is now cheaper than bronze or iron. Thus, reclusion to pursue one’s aspirations was once the mark of a noble scholar, but today, mountain-dwelling scholars are deemed unworthy. The pillars of sagacity in ancient times have become the criminals of benighted ages; the steadfast rocks of the past are the feeble remnants of later days.\n\nThe noble man who walks the Dao is not merely a towering wall of a thousand fathoms—his depth is vaster than the Lüliang rapids. Yet the shortsighted and narrow-minded cannot appreciate him, just as the shallow cannot fathom him. Thus, they deem him strange and belittle him, resent him for not seeking their favor, and despise him for not valuing their approval. If he is not esteemed or employed, what more is there to say?\n\nThus, there are those who cast dust upon white jades, who breed sores upon skin of jade—slandering flaws in unison, they assail the independent, as if Zeng Shen were a bandit or a robber, and as if Chao Fu and Xu You had been thieves and burglars. If not for the luminous mirror of the Dark Heavens to reveal the subtle, who could sift through mud to draw forth sunken jade, or dredge the river to pluck pearls from the depths?\n\nWhen fine jades lie unsold in the marketplace, how much worse their fate when veiled in uncut stone? When extraordinary scholars are barred at the gate, how much more so when they remain hidden in the marshes? Sun Bin longed to deploy his secret strategies, yet Sima Qian had his feet cut off; Han Fei wished to establish his governance, yet Li Si had him killed; Jia Yi was impassioned with statecraft, yet was pushed aside by warriors; Liu Xiang, loyal and upright, possessed the tools to save a nation in peril, yet was ensnared by Hong and Xian. Thus, Bian He wept blood while clutching his uncut jade, and Qin Xi shattered his skull in despair.\n\nJade and stone are easily distinguished, just as the worthy and the foolish; the love for treasures runs deep, as does the fondness for scholars. Yet even when precious gems—so readily discerned—are paired with objects of profound affection, they still incur punishment and mutilation through the ages, enduring false accusations. How much worse, then, for the worthy, who are difficult to recognize and not a priority in the minds of men? When nothing is there to guard against, schemers still draw legs on snakes; treacherous ministers fear the harm of loyalty and integrity. Those who bend their bodies resent the upright bearing of Mohist scholars; those who strip naked at night despise the coming of a bright candle. Thus, lofty reputations and virtuous deeds are suppressed and uncelebrated, while baseless slander takes shape before its shadow, emerging without cause. Without a Chu man’s wailing recommendation, a one-in-ten-thousand encounter is all the more impossible—such is only fitting.\n\nFor those who take jade to be stone will also take stone to be jade; those who take the worthy to be fools will also take fools to be worthy.\n\nTaking stone for jade does no harm, but taking fools for the worthy is the diagnostic sign of ruin. For when ruin is diagnosed, though one may yet live, one is bound to perish—just as when the pulse is dead, though one may yet breathe, one is bound to die. Can one not be cautious?\n\nAlas! How tragic that none reflect on this. Of old, Confucius, the supreme sage, was entangled by the men of Qi in the east and blocked by Zixi in the south. Wen Zhong, a man of great worth, was at first not even acknowledged by the customs of Jing, and in the end, though he wandered in the courts of kings, he could not establish his merit in his prime. Is this not difficult?\n\nFor jade like Jielü and Heili cannot be sold without a Tao Qi; a weight of a thousand jun cannot be lifted without a Meng Ben or Wu Huo; the strains of \"White Snow\" cannot be played without a Ling Su; and talent surpassing the common run cannot be employed without an enlightened lord. Yet luminous pearls, treasures of the night, do not dim their essence for lack of seekers nor sell themselves cheaply to base merchants. Great bells and Zhou tripods do not, for being cast aside, diminish their dignity nor accept elevation by dwarfs. The zithers of Yiyang and Yunhe do not, for being unused, cease their song to vie with lewd melodies. Virtues that crown the multitude do not, for being suppressed, tread the byways or sever their integrity to follow the vulgar.\n\nThus, the He-bi jade becomes stagnant goods; supple wood is discarded as useless; the ore of the Red Blade never passes through the furnace of Ou Ye; and the ranks of the Yuan Kai never gain the opening of the Four Gates.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Mandate**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: Among my friends there is one called the Recluse of Cold Lodge. Serene and joyful, pure and still, he forgets both form and spirit. Outwardly, he does not adorn himself with the guise of startling the foolish; inwardly, he does not harbor the mind of deliberate action. His spirit roams the ancient texts, and his joy makes him forget sorrow. His brush races the last rays of Fuxi and Nüwa; his gaze lingers on the afterglow of Wangshu. The Dao is never too distant for him to guard against; his words, though subtle, are never unrefined. Yet his carriage does not halt at the gates of the powerful and influential; his letters do not pass through the courts of the noble and mighty. Thus, his name does not leave his thatched door; his person does not depart his furrowed fields.\n\nThereupon, the Winged Brightness Grandee questioned and challenged him, saying: \"I have heard that when the coiled dragon rises, dark clouds gather; when the transforming influence of the Dao spreads, hidden talents emerge. Thus, the broad streets resound with the songs of unicorns; the sacrificial vessels bear the traces of soaring winds. When such influence touches them, they reap profits beyond measure; when it spurs them, they ascend beyond the heavens. They shine with dazzling light in the Valley of the Sun; they spread great brightness through the Nine Heavens. Their merit casts a shade that endures forever; their fame resounds without limit. Therefore, though the path of a thousand ren is near, those who do not walk it cannot reach it, even with the speed of the wind. Though the space beneath the eaves is low, those who do not rise cannot attain it, even with the wings of the great peng.\"\n\nMoreover, how can one who rests content beyond the vast wilderness, who folds their wings upon the branches of secluded parasols, ever hope to emulate the trustworthy, chase the light, or shake off their lightness beneath the azure vault?\n\nAlas! The span of years swiftly fades, never to return; the world drifts like a fleeting shadow, never to repeat. The wise tread upon frost and know the inevitable coming of solid ice; dwelling in beginnings, they perceive the destined end of all living things. The six dragons hasten their course through the great chaos; the peak of glory vanishes in an instant, announcing dusk. Thus did the ancients reflect upon the current, sighing in decline, or glance at the passing gap and rise in sorrow.\n\nThe Master possesses a transcendent capacity born of the age, harboring sublime excellence beyond the common, his keen brush vast and deep as surging waves, his sixfold ingenuity pent up in profound reserve. Yet he cannot ascend the swaying heights, nor soar aloft to shine with pure radiance through the Nine Mysteries. His vessels remain unarrayed at the end of the ritual stands; his person is not spared the toil of bearing firewood. Still, he offers harmonious tones in a deafened world, peddles ceremonial caps in a land of unbound hair—vainly striving to awaken the literary realm, sharpening his intent to fathom the divine, cherishing jade-like purity within his embrace, and pouring forth gem-like words from brush and ink. His body suffers the hardship of repeated want; his spirit labors between steadfastness and loftiness. It is as though a foot-long jade disk were buried beneath layers of earth, or brocade were sealed within a locked coffer—forever without the wealth of exchange, who would recognize the treasure thus concealed?\n\nWhen the dragon and steed are fettered, how can they be distinguished from the lame donkey? When the red blade sheathes its edge, how does it differ from a leaden knife? The sturgeon and salmon do not dwell in ox tracks; the great peng does not linger in the brushwood. I wish the Master would forsake the dragon-serpent’s den, ascend the path of advantage and visibility, cast off the seclusion of his courtyard, and awaken from the two mice. Let him depart the barren valley to scale the heights, don the crimson robes to replace the plain, and vie with the dawn’s swift winds rather than tarry through the night. Let him gather his noble vessels in the exalted realm, turn toward the blessings of tripods and cauldrons, and in the evening become a man of renown—what need has he to admire the fern-picking hermit?\n\nResiding in the cold, the Master replied: I have heard that the subtle mechanism of the spirit is distant and obscure, the mingling of fortune and misfortune entwined in the interplay of concealment and revelation, the rise and fall entangled in the ebb and flow. The fleeting cannot escape the shadow that pursues the body; the joyful in success cannot avoid the ruin of principle. The craftsman who chases the branch’s end does not match one who emerges from the primal forge; the one who mends the already-made does not equal one who returns to the source beyond the uncarved block.\n\nThus, the wise inchworm willingly bends to preserve its extension; the one who discerns closure and opening does not grieve or rejoice over adversity or prosperity. Moreover, the great potter shapes things, the great image flows through forms—yet haste and stillness diverge in aspiration, soaring and sinking clash in disposition. Gold and jade are heavy; feathers and down are light. The narrow-minded cling to the dregs; the profoundly enlightened roam free in the pure and mysterious. The stagnant marsh accepts the trickling stream yet chokes on the vast sea; the whale swallows a hundred rivers yet remains unfilled. The goby and shrimp leap joyfully in the mire; the red dragon soars mightily through the lofty heights. Those who chew the fragrant bait rush to their death in pursuit of desire; those who savor emptiness and blandness embrace the harmony of heaven and hasten toward life. The one who recognizes the divine mechanism gazes upon the formless without confusion; the one blind to fortune and misfortune is startled by the strong crossbow’s bolt. Each clings to their preferences—how could they willingly change their course?\n\nI have heard that the five jades cannot carve themselves from the Song Mountains; the soaring serpent cannot streak like lightning without mist. The dragon’s abyss cannot sever rhinoceros hide without grasping its blade; the great bell cannot resound without being struck. The golden fungus requires the autumn wind to gleam; the oriole awaits the misty haze to refine its song. The fine steed does not recklessly gallop into peril; the noble man does not risk his name through deceitful encounters. When fate is adverse, he sinks into obscurity; when the time is right, he soars high in the celestial court. The scholar who advertises himself is not truly lofty; the woman who offers herself is not truly chaste. Why must one emulate the lofty standard of washing one’s ears or imitate the honor of bearing the sacrificial stand?\n\nWhen one is in dire straits, Yu the dancer may whirl in obscurity while the great Taifu Lü Shang is driven away by a foolish old woman; Fan Li suffers humiliation amid the reeds of a sinking mat. Men of refined bearing conceal their brilliance in farming and herding. Yet when their time comes, the Huaiyin Marquis casts his fishing rod and declares himself sovereign; Wen Zhong removes his straw sandals to don the azure sash; Fu Yue lays down his trowel to discourse on the Dao; Guan Zhong sheds his shackles to become chief minister. The noble man stores his talents in readiness, accumulates virtue for action—when the time is not right, he does not appear; when the lord is not worthy, he does not serve. Rise and fall depend on circumstance, while withdrawal or advancement is not bound to any fixed course. In stillness, he becomes the paragon of recluses; in action, the model of great ministers. Some devote their thoughts to establishing words; others inscribe merit in the vessels of state. Though their paths differ, their ultimate aim is one.\n\nA scholar may cultivate conduct worthy of honor, yet cannot compel the world to honor it; he may possess talents fit for use, yet cannot compel the age to employ them. Clad in coarse cloth, eating wild herbs, angling for fish and setting snares for rabbits, his heart is joyful and his mind content, as if he would spend his life thus. Donning court robes, riding in carriages, draped in crimson and girded with purple, he remains as if these were his natural garb, like a commoner in plain clothes—such is the bearing of the perfected man. If one possesses the treasures of the banquet hall yet lacks the purity of a life confined to four bare walls, the fault is one’s own. That few recognize one’s worth, that rank and position do not come—if jade is called stone, if the phoenix is mistaken for a quail, the blame is not mine.\n\nTo fret over recognition or chafe at obscurity is the way of ordinary men. To nurture qi with boundless composure and desires with serene indifference—this is the state of one free from vexation. When the time is right, the Dao is practiced and one’s vessel is great; yet the heavens and earth do not rejoice. The man who understands fate does not grieve.\n\nAs for those who peddle goods worth ten thousand in hopes of a hundredfold return, losing their very flesh and bones in the bargain—I have no leisure for such pursuits.\n\n**On Names and Reality (Chapter Nineteen)**\n\nA disciple asked: “I have heard that in the late Han, during the reigns of Emperor Ling and Emperor Xian, evaluations of men became chaotic and reckless. The talented and reclusive languished in obscurity while the gluttonous and rapacious rose to power. Names no longer matched reality; prices no longer reflected value. Those who prospered were deemed worthy, while those who struggled were called fools. What was the reason for this?”\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity replied: “The thunderclap may roar, yet some do not hear it; the seven luminaries traverse the sky, yet some do not see them. Is it only the senses that suffer deafness and blindness? The heart and spirit may be equally obscured. Thus, one may hear profound words yet fail to recognize them—not for lack of ears. One may see extraordinary men yet fail to know them—not for lack of eyes. It is because one’s hearing does not reach the subtle, one’s vision does not attain the marvelous.”\n\nThose of great wisdom and far-reaching capacity stand firm as mountains, while those of petty intellect and narrow ambition drift like tumbleweeds or float as duckweed. Only by standing as mountains can one remain unshaken; only by floating as duckweed can one flow without stagnation.\n\nIn the realm of goods, those sealed and stored in wait for buyers are often the rarest treasures, hardest to sell, while those loudly touted with drums are quickly exhausted, though flawed. In the realm of talent, those whose roots run deep in the sacred peaks may tower a thousand *ren* and spread their canopies over ten thousand *mu*, yet go unnoticed; those planted along the thoroughfares, though crooked and meager, though swift to rot, are still put to use. Thus, the ancestral halls hold withered willows carved into ritual vessels, while the remote valleys teem with catalpas left uncut. Those who usurp the name of blossoms soar like ants into the clouds; those who lose their true worth sink like jade dragons into the Nine Springs. Thereupon, the sparrow hawks beat the wind in lofty flight, while the divine phoenix folds its wings in seclusion. Lead and tin fill the treasuries of *Tai’e* blades, while dogs and sheep, frivolous in gait, assume the guise of tigers and wolves.\n\nThe flatterer, wielding precious bribes as mighty wings, reaches heights unattainable; riding factions as boats and oars, crosses distances unnavigable. Rising early, standing at attention, anticipating desires, and obeying commands—his glib tongue and artful words seem eloquent; his hearsay and gossip seem learned; his treacherous heart wears a gentle face, seeming kind; his filthy deeds appear pure, seeming upright; his delight in others’ faults seems loyal; his disregard for taboos seems forthright. Thus, he gains much access.\n\nMoreover, those who curry favor hope for my desires, and I desire what they desire; those who do not seek me, I cannot love—such is the natural principle. The worthy are ever few, the foolish ever many; the many form cliques to conceal flaws, while the few stand alone and unsupported. Flatterers draw one another up, blocking the right path; the wise and sagacious remain in lowly positions, unseen. The way of the thatched hut is violated, and those who ride oxcarts rise in swarms. The lofty dragon falls, weeping blood in streams. Zixi banished the great sage Confucius; Zang Cang slandered the epochal Mencius—neither of these two escaped such misfortune. How much less, then, those who come after? This calamity has arisen alongside the opening of the universe, and its bitterness is not confined to a single age.\n\nLooking back through the ages, this affliction has been common. The slow and lame crane their necks in ornate carriages, while swift steeds are left to pasture in the wilds. Some already occupy the seats of state, exhausting the nation; others are exiled to Shen and Hai; some have their sinews torn out in the ancestral temple; others meet their end at Wangyi. All because what they guarded was not true, and loyal ability went unused.\n\nThus, the enlightened ruler diligently seeks the worthy and eagerly promotes the extraordinary, clearing obstructions and strictly preventing blockages. When talent is truly sufficient for the task, he does not scruple over butchers or fishermen; when words are verified as sound, he draws them from the ranks of soldiers or exiles. Some are raised from the cattle’s mouth to join the ranks of officials; some are lifted from fetters to bear the weight of the state. Only thus can great deeds be accomplished, frontiers expanded, distant lands subdued, might established, and achievements endure, passing down through the ages.\n\nThe upright and honest are hated by crooked wood; the pure and impartial are despised by the treacherous. If the ruler cannot wield the dark mirror to search out the hidden but must rely on those in power to make recommendations, then, observing past ages, one finds that those who monopolize authority invariably promote only their own adherents.\n\nThose who seek personal gain slander what they fear and promote what they favor—what they fear are the utterly impartial, while what they favor are those who share their private interests. When the utterly impartial are employed, cliques of treachery are shattered; when a multitude of private interests prevail, the ruler’s authority is usurped. The shattering of treacherous cliques is the path to prosperity and peace; the usurpation of the ruler’s authority is the gradual onset of peril and ruin. In slandering what they fear, they fear that their words are not cutting enough—even mutilation by amputation or disfigurement would not satisfy them, and thus they must eliminate such men to feel at ease. In promoting what they favor, they find even the most lavish praise insufficient—even meteoric advancement would not content them, and thus they must endanger others to secure their own position. Hence, those who embrace injustice and die, or those without fault who are demoted, have long had their origins here.\n\nThus, those who embody the Dao and align with truth stand towering and apart, their talents far-reaching and their aspirations lofty, their conduct as pure as frost and their thoughts as boundless as heaven and earth. Their bearing is as measured as the scales of Yu and Kai, their demeanor as deep and still as a hidden abyss, as steadfast as a mountain. They would rather preserve their integrity in obscurity than bow in servility for fleeting gain; they delight in hunger and humble dwellings to uphold their noble principles. They conceal their talents and preserve their true nature, awaiting the natural end of their years, emerging only when the time is right, acting only when propriety demands. Clad in coarse cloth, chewing on wild greens, they remain untroubled. Though their hair may turn yellow with age and their fate remain unfulfilled, they feel no regret. How could they stoop to the height of Mount Tai to fit a square peg, or gather the wings of the heavens to serve as a morning alarm? How could they submit to the ranks of petty officials, stifled beneath the mediocre, abandon the forests of the phoenix to dwell in the brambles, or vie for perches with crows and owls, bending a foot to straighten a fathom?\n\nMoreover, the demeanor of the great worthies is marked by supreme simplicity, their tastes so plain as to seem desolate, yet they are self-sufficient, serene, and unassuming. Few recognize their wisdom, and though the times do not employ them, they feel no distress. Though they may go days without even the humblest grain of porridge, they would not exchange it for the richest feast of injustice. Though their garments may be threadbare, lacking even a full year’s warmth, they would not delight in the white fox fur of a lawless ruler. They alone may loosen their hair, recline at ease, and guard what they possess, refusing to bow or lower their brows to seek what they do not need. They do not associate with those whose virtue is meager but whose rank is high, nor do they befriend those whose names belie their reality. They do not pursue fleeting glory or chase after power, nor do they consort with the cunning or the mighty. They do not engage in trivial debates or vulgar persuasion, nor do they follow those who bow in servility. Outwardly foolish yet inwardly enlightened, their faces may be unwashed yet their conduct pure—profound as the heights of Mount Song, their depths unmeasurable by any scale, vast as the boundless expanse.\n\nVast as the ocean, its depths defy measurement by the dou or the hu—towering in height beyond the reach of a thousand *ren*, its wealth surpassing that of the hundred officials. Behold those petty thieves: they are but weeds in the wild. Lofty are the principles of those who stand aloof from the world, soaring beyond the realm of autumn clouds, their spirits transcending the mundane. Dwelling at the summit of the Nine Heavens, though impoverished and lowly, they cannot be coerced by threats, nor swayed by profit, no matter how dire their suffering. Their undertakings may be heard of, yet never fully grasped; their grasp may be seen, yet never debated.\n\nThus, those who despise them raise a chorus of scorn and cast sidelong glances, while those who cherish them are few and feeble, offering no aid—like a handful of soil vainly trying to dam a bursting river, or a ladle of water seeking to quench a prairie fire. Thereupon, the drums fall silent, muffling the roar of thunder; the *tao*, the *pi*, the *gao*—their clamorous din—are left to clamor unchecked. Fragrant orchids are uprooted, foul abalone is worn as adornment, the sacred *chang* is poured out and discarded without shame. Watered-down wine is poured in libation upon the sacred mound, while blood-sweating steeds are driven away, their ears drooping. The lame and the halt are made to gallop before the imperial chariot—this is why the ancients embraced sand and bore stones to plunge into the currents, choosing the burial of fish rather than endure the same world as these. So be it.\n\nAlas! Yet to cast fine millet into the mire is not because the night-shining pearl is false—it is that none recognize it. To cast the vermilion quiver aside unbent is not because the *Fanruo* bow lacks strength—it is that none appreciate it. Thus, jade and chalcedony await *Jing He* to reveal their price of linked cities; the *Wuhao* bow requires *Feng Men* to display its power to pierce armor. The *Feitu* steed depends on *Ziyu* to soar on the wind; the talented man relies solely on a true patron to give his strength. If fine jade does not emerge from the deep mountain, if the good bow is not carved from a hundred layers, if the *Jilu* steed is not harnessed to the vermilion carriage, if the man of destiny does not tread the path of rank and power—who then would know their ability to unfurl radiant splendor, to strike down cloud-scraping birds from a thousand fathoms, to gallop swift as the wind, or to bring order to the hundred offices?\n\nYet if they meet no such fate, they may not be mixed and kneaded with tiles and stones, nor yoked in lowly harness like rotten wood, nor ranked among the common and the petty. Alas! To draw a thornwood arrow and expect a master archer from the *Quguang* marsh, to rely on a weary nag and seek to follow the tracks of *Zhou Mu*, to wield an axe and hope to match the dual craft of *Ban* and *Mo*, to neglect true talent and yet desire the proper ordering of constant norms—is this not difficult? Though name and reality may leak away in this generation, their virtuous renown may yet be sought by those to come.\n\nRejoice in Heaven and know fate—what is there to fear, what to grieve? Abide in time and follow the natural order—what is there to resent, what to blame?\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Clear Discernment**\n\nThe *Baopuzi* said: It is commonly held that those of unmatched martial prowess are fit to be supreme generals, and those well-versed in order and chaos are suited for the throne of the Three and the Nine. Yet Zhang Fei and Guan Yu, each a match for ten thousand men, both lost their heads and brought humiliation to their lord, their severed crowns offered up—were they not lacking in something? Kong Rong, though refined in conduct and surpassing in letters, failed utterly in governance, his downfall lying precisely where he should have excelled. Deng Yu and Ma Yuan were mere scholars from the fields, yet adept in the art of war; Xiao He and Cao Shen never delved into the classics, yet excelled as chief ministers. From this, we see that truly knowing men is no easy task.\n\nIf one insists on testing them before employing them, one fears the tripod may topple and the broth spill. If one relies on words and appearances, one risks mistaking the specious for the true, for falsehood and authenticity are often intertwined. Yet the world deems this an easy matter—merely glancing at a man, they claim to grasp him entirely. I remain deeply skeptical and dare not assent.\n\nTo distinguish the worthy from the unworthy, to perceive the spirit through form—this depends on the man himself. It cannot be forced. Unless one’s clarity rivals the sun and moon, or one’s hearing transcends sound itself, one must proceed with gradual discernment, advancing step by step. One cannot entrust great responsibility all at once, nor lightly lend the sharpest blade, for once given, reclaiming it is exceedingly difficult, and the damage incurred may be great.\n\nShould one’s dimness in one matter guarantee ignorance in all others? Those who resemble me are not necessarily useful, nor are those who differ from me necessarily negligible.\n\nSome may object: Heaven hangs its signs, and earth bears its forms. Gazing at mountains and measuring rivers, one may infer their heights and depths; when winds rise and clouds take flight, one may divine fortune and misfortune. The wise man, seeing a mountain not yet exhausted, perceives the fine jade within; beholding a shore not yet withered, senses the luminous pearl submerged in the deep. When a comet appears, he knows the *zhan* fish is about to die; when the sun and moon are eclipsed, he recognizes the *qilin* locked in combat. The weight of Mount Hua and Mount Tai can be known without scales, just as the unfathomable depths of rivers and seas are fixed without measurement.\n\nThe wings of the swan and the swift hooves of the *lu* steed, though they have not yet flown or run, are surely light and swift. The sword of Hao Cao and the dagger of the Xu clan, though they have not yet struck, will undoubtedly sever with precision. The calf of the brindled ox has the capacity to swallow a bull; the fledgling osprey bears the fierce mien of its kind. Where plants flourish, the soil is rich; where fish grow large, the waters are vast. A tiger’s tail does not attach to a fox’s body, nor does ivory emerge from an elephant’s mouth.\n\nShu Yu’s insatiable greed was evident from his birth; the signs of Shi Wo’s betrayal of our clan were manifest from the moment he opened his womb. When Wu Chen was but a child, Shen Tong foresaw his theft of a wife; Zhang Fu recognized Chen Ping’s future greatness at first glance. Fan Li vanished into the Five Lakes because of Goujian’s wasp-like eyes and bird-like beak; the people of Zhao abandoned their ambitions for conquest because of Bai Qi’s sharp brow and piercing gaze.\n\nKing Wen met Lü Shang beneath the mulberry’s shade, and before the shadow had shifted, knew him worthy of command. Emperor Xuan beheld Zhuge Liang, and before the sundial’s shadow had changed, entrusted him with his heart and mind. Guo Tai, though of middling talent, excelled in knowing men: in Yingchuan, he befriended Li Yuanli; in Chenliu, he allied with Fu Weiming; in Waihuang, he drew close to Han Zizhu; in Puheng, he revered Chou Jizhi; in his school, he gathered Pang Degong; observing the plowman, he discerned Mao Jiqi. He saw that Meng Min, though burdened with a load, would drop it without a second thought, and warned Yuan Ai of his impending ruin—his words proved entirely accurate.\n\nMust one not be able to discern the keen from the dull by their outward signs, judge urgency and composure by their demeanor, gauge brightness and obscurity by their voice and bearing, observe their generosity or stinginess in fitting measure, assess truth and falsehood in their words and deeds, examine their conduct in both public and private, and compare their beginnings and ends with the evidence of their trustworthiness? Is this not an easy task?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replied: I do not claim that men are entirely unknowable, nor that discerning them is without principle. I merely say that this art exists, and that great clarity is required—yet men of the world each presume themselves capable. Thus, I offer these words as a warning to those who would entrust responsibility.\n\nFor a man’s imposing appearance does not guarantee his worth, nor does a frail frame ensure his folly. The roaring man is not necessarily brave, nor is the gentle man necessarily timid. Some may share the same outward form yet differ in intent; others may have distinct natures yet converge in purpose. This is not like the fixed seasons of heaven and earth or the unchanging contours of mountains and rivers.\n\nThings may be distant yet easily known, or near yet difficult to fathom—just as the eye can survey the vast heavens but cannot perceive the nape of one’s own neck, or as the ear can hear thunder yet cannot detect the sound of ants and lice.\n\nTang Lü and Fan Xu were skilled in physiognomy, yet could only discern longevity, poverty, wealth, rank, and status—they could not fathom a man’s temperament, whether broad or narrow, nor the rise and fall of his aspirations and conduct. If even the emperor finds this difficult, how much more so the common man?\n\nYou cite examples of judging by form and challenge me with talk of spirit—yet you have not grasped the root and have strayed from the point. The arrows of the archer who never misses may all pierce the autumn down, yet if he cannot consistently hit the target, he is not truly skilled. Shen, the mother of Shu Xiang, may have had one success, but she could not repeat it. Yao, who studied the ancients, misplaced his trust in Ji; the sagely Duke of Zhou erred in his appointment of Confucius. One may discern the rise and fall of distant omens yet fail to recognize a worthy man standing before him; Yan Shigu could judge purity and impurity across a thousand years yet was blind to the extraordinary talent within arm’s reach. If knowing men is so exceedingly difficult, then even Guo Tai’s judgments must have surpassed those of the sages.\n\nYet his successes were obvious and easily recognized, while his failures went unrecorded. What is truly valuable is to perceive outstanding talent among the nameless, to spot the swift steed on the slopes of Wu, to pluck the pearl-bearing oyster from the ninefold abyss, to point out the luminous jewel amid the piled stones. Like Bo Jie, who recognized the instrument of perfect pitch in the ashes of a fire, or Zhang Heng, who selected the bamboo of exquisite resonance before it was used—amidst the gathering of six armies or the bustle of the marketplace, a single glance should suffice, without confusion, to probe the hidden depths of a man’s heart, to determine his course from beginning to end. This is the untransmitted marvel of true discernment.\n\nIf, as you suggest, one must wait to observe the entirety of a man’s conduct, to witness the beauty or ugliness of his deeds, then it is like weighing silk threads after they have been measured on the scale, or declaring the length of cloth after it has been cut—anyone can do this. Why would the wise need to trouble themselves?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Conduct and Character**\n\nThe *Baopuzi* said: To emulate the all-encompassing embrace of the Mysterious and the Yellow, to illuminate the radiance of the sun and moon, to display the patterns of the Dao and manifest brilliance—this is to surpass the vulgar and the empty. To embody the subtle workings of the spirit while appearing foolish, to never repeat a mistake while seeming obsequious—such is the worthy man.\n\nTo dwell in the tranquility of non-action, to tread the path of integrity and uphold impartiality—such is the man of the Dao.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* said: One who exhausts all offerings in life and death, preserving even his hair and skin to glorify his name—this is the filial man. One who extends compassion to all living beings, constantly forgiving others in his dealings—this is the benevolent man. One who aligns his life with the nation’s cause, enduring peril and hardship with unwavering integrity—this is the loyal man.

One who delves into ancient texts, mastering past teachings to exhaust principle—this is the learned man. One who sharpens his mind in refined virtue, begrudging even a moment’s delay in cultivating power—this is the self-cultivating man. One who possesses vast knowledge yet treats wealth and gain as if they were lost—this is the incorruptible man. One who remains unchanged by gain or loss, unshaken by desire—this is the steadfast man. One who rushes to aid in hardship, taking others’ toil as his own duty—this is the devoted man. One who maintains purity and integrity to the end, refusing to yield even to avoid harm—this is the principled man.

One who tracks the waxing and waning of the seven luminaries, deducing the patterns of rise and fall—this is the diviner. One who charges into blades without fear, wrestling tigers in the wilds—this is the brave man. One who commands with solemn presence, enforcing laws without wavering—this is the stern man. One who devises ingenious tools to aid utility, mastering both sound and calculation—this is the skilled artisan. One who defies the strong without hesitation, undaunted by peril—this is the resolute man. One who toils tirelessly day and night, enduring hardship without complaint—this is the diligent man. One who remains unshaken by slander, unmoved by fear—this is the unyielding man. One who hears praise without joy, faces hardship without faltering—this is the composed man. One who acts decisively when right, undeterred by doubt—this is the decisive man. One who follows the inked line in advance and retreat, never seeking fortune through recklessness—this is the prudent man. One who upholds rites and propriety in competition, blameless even toward distant kin—this is the virtuous man. One who treads the plain Way without desire, unmoved by the times—this is the unadorned man. Those who possess none of these virtues yet fail to follow the path of the good—these are the inferior.\n\nHis disciples asked: \"We have heard the marks of the good man’s conduct. May we now learn of the deeds that warn the common folk?\"\n\nThe *Baopuzi* said: One who neglects to care for his parents, harming the Dao to indulge himself—this is the rebellious man. One who harbors deceit to seize fleeting glory, benefiting himself at the cost of his life—this is the treacherous man. One who abandons the right path of benevolence and justice, endangering others to secure his own safety—this is the treacherous man. One who delights in strife without restraint, slandering the upright to harm the honest—this is the wicked man. One who deviates from the inked line to wound others, delighting in killing and cruelty—this is the cruel man. One who adorns false doctrines to spread slander, entangling the loyal and pure—this is the slanderous man. One whose words are cunning but deeds betray them, walking in filth yet feigning purity—this is the flattering man. One who ignores right and wrong, indulging anger to vent rage—this is the violent man. One who feigns small virtues to gain trust, secretly harboring malice toward all—this is the deceitful man. One who follows the wind to curry favor, gauging the ruler’s intent to support wrongdoing—this is the sycophant. One whose words shift without thought, making empty promises—this is the hollow man. One who sees profit and forgets righteousness, casting aside shame for petty gain—this is the greedy man. One who gazes upon beauty and loses his heart, adorning himself in finery to indulge in depravity—this is the lustful man. One who hesitates in success, errs in action, and regrets often—this is the dim-witted man. One who rejects teachings and acts alone, ashamed to seek counsel from those wiser—this is the arrogant man. One who knows good but does not act, accomplishing little despite much effort—this is the inept man. One who neglects virtue and cultivates power, currying favor to ingratiate himself—this is the corrupt man. One who takes shortcuts for quick success, wielding bribes to seize advantage—this is the crooked man. One who is haughty and cruel, delighting in humiliating his betters—this is the brutal man. One who endures wrongs yet falsely confesses, trembling at the slightest hardship—this is the cowardly man. One who nitpicks in crowds, speaking recklessly to the wrong people—this is the shallow man. One who fails to grasp what is fitting, aspiring yet falling short—this is the foolish man. One who knows right from wrong yet refuses to change, hearing good advice yet worsening—this is the deluded man. One who lacks compassion, cutting ties with kin and friends—this is the callous man. One who resents what he cannot attain, rejoicing in others’ misfortune—this is the envious man. One who hoards wealth and scorns righteousness, ignoring the suffering of others—this is the miserly man. One who courts danger for gain, undeterred by disaster—this is the foolish man. One who is narrow-minded and clannish, obsessed with profit—this is the petty man. One who indulges in hunting and gambling without end—this is the dissipated man. One who forgets the distinctions of rank, delighting in extravagant display—this is the extravagant man. One who wallows in sensuality, neglecting proper observances—this is the dissolute man. One who lacks ambition for self-cultivation, neglecting his household—this is the lazy man. One who lacks resolve, acting carelessly without thought—this is the frivolous man. One who hears of the Way and acts as if drunk, stirred by talk of wealth—this is the deluded man. One who judges poorly with many errors, blind to right and wrong—this is the clumsy man. One who hates the worthy and scorns their words, deaf to lofty counsel—this is the perverse man.\n\nThose who see crimson and purple yet cannot distinguish them, even when admonished to their ears yet fail to awaken—these are the benighted. Those who violate the Way and virtue, hesitating and faltering, recklessly transgressing rites and laws without regard—these are the disorderly. Those whose every action invites ridicule, whose every word defies reason—these are the inept. Those who serve the powerful as if slaves and bondservants, yet turn their backs on the weak and forget past kindnesses—these are the treacherous. Those who abandon old friends of humble means, slighting scholars and acting with arrogance—these are the haughty. Those who forsake aging kin to pursue endless desires, neglecting office and study for distant wanderings—these are the reckless. Those lacking steadfast loyalty and trustworthiness, forsaking gratitude to chase profit—these are the traitors. Those who feign agreement to your face but slander you behind your back—these are the deceitful. Those who cultivate aggression and stubbornness, rejecting loyal counsel and refusing advice—these are the obstinate.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: Human talents are not easily discerned, for truth and falsehood may resemble one another. Among scholars, there are those whose appearance is refined, their bearing elegant and poised—at first glance, they dazzle the eye; upon closer meeting, they please the heart. Their demeanor is like that of dragons and tigers, circling with perfect form. Yet their minds are clouded, their spirits dull; their talents are nonexistent, and all they possess clings only to their skin. They cannot utter a single insight, nor string together half a sentence. In office, they cannot govern the people; in war, they cannot command troops. In administration, affairs collapse; in missions, they bring shame. In action or stillness, they are never fitting; in advancement or retreat, they are never apt. This is the first difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars whose appearance seems unadorned and weary, their bearing coarse and unrefined, their voice and manner subdued. In movement, they are stiff and awkward, yet they harbor hidden brilliance and treasure profound learning. Their conduct is lofty, their abilities surpassing those of the finest ministers; their writings flourish like spring forests. In office, all affairs prosper; in war, they achieve complete victory. This is the second difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars whose strategies are profound, their schemes divine, their wisdom encompassing success and failure, their thoughts penetrating the obscure and mysterious. Their talents are all-encompassing, their abilities suited to the highest affairs. Yet their mouths cannot convey what their hearts hold, nor can their brushes capture their intent. In casual encounters, they appear no different from the ordinary. This is the third difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars who are quick-witted and sharp, their words artful and dazzling, their analogies flowing like a deep spring, their manner forceful. Yet what they speak, they cannot practice. Skilled in recognizing the past, they falter in managing the present. When governing, governance falters; when shepherding the people, the people resent them. This is the fourth difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars whose outward demeanor is reverent, their words and bearing respectful, yet their spirits are slack, their hearts scattered and unrestrained. When entrusted with tasks, they feel no concern; when placed in charge, they bring no order. This is the fifth difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars who can draw a bow to its fullest, shoot arrows through stone, ride backward, stand on tiptoe, and master all five weapons. Yet their bodies are light, their thoughts shallow; their hands are strong, but their hearts are timid. In mock trials, they have no equal, but in real use, they prove ineffective. At the sight of dust from an approaching enemy, they flee in panic; at the sound of the foe, they lose their nerve. This is the sixth difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars whose manner is unyielding and slow, their words few, their appearance plain. Their conduct is flawed, lacking small courage, constrained and cautious. They endure insults without retaliation, like birds with clipped wings and lowered talons. Yet their courage is steadfast, their hearts resolute. They fear no powerful foe, and where righteousness lies, they face death as if returning home. Even if dismembered, they will not alter their resolve. This is the seventh difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars who are filial and fraternal, gentle and kind, their demeanor calm and refined. They walk in trust and think in compliance, never transgressing propriety. In hardship, they remain pure, their integrity as clear as ice and frost. Yet they are slow and impractical, unable to grasp essentials or act on opportunity. Their undertakings yield no success; in their own conduct, they are reckless. When entrusted with tasks, they fail to rise to the occasion. This is the eighth difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars whose conduct is lofty and unconstrained, their character stern and towering. They whistle and strut, disdaining their peers and scorning convention. They are careless in small matters, their faults exceeding reason, acting as if no one else exists. They form cliques to attack and slander, aligning with those who share their failures. Scholars and friends do not follow them, and critics dismiss them. Yet in court, they stand with unyielding integrity, knowing no restraint in their loyalty to their superiors, and governing their subordinates with clarity. This is the ninth difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars who are generous and broad-minded, humble in receiving others, concealing faults and hiding flaws. They are warm, respectful, incorruptible, diligent, and modest, aiding the endangered and preserving trust. They entrust their lives without doubt, and orphans under their care are secure. Yet though pure and good, they are blind to power; though benevolent, they lack decisiveness. They cannot reward the good or bear to punish the wicked. Their loyalty and integrity are abundant, but their practical abilities are lacking. Like one holding an axe, they hesitate, abandoning laws and indulging wrongs, mixing right and wrong, ultimately leading to failure and defeat. This is the tenth difficulty in discernment.\n\nThings may appear similar yet be fundamentally different, seeming one way yet being another. To judge without confusion, one must perceive both form and spirit—how much more so for those who are not sages? Thus, in employing talent, selecting scholars, fostering closeness, and forming friendships, one cannot but be discerning, cannot but be thorough in testing.\n\nMoreover, the confusion of human nature and conduct may begin upright but end in depravity—like Wang Mang, who at first seemed finer than Yi and Huo, yet in the end was more vicious than Zhao Gao. Such transformations are not something even men of middling talent can fully anticipate.\n\nIf scholars were as easily distinguished as the wren from the swan, the fox and hare from the dragon and qilin, then the Four Fiends would not have gained office in Yao’s court, Guan and Cai would not have nearly endangered the Zhou dynasty, Confucius would not have erred with Zhan Tai, Yanling would not have regretted discarding his gold, Yi Yin would not have labored seventy times, and Xiang Yu would not have regretted dismissing Fan Zeng.\n\nThe trouble lies in the confusion caused by things like *wufu* jade resembling true jade, the *jiaomiao* moth mimicking the phoenix, frozen ice resembling crystal, and smoke resembling misty vapors. Thus, even the wise may err.\n\nHow much more difficult is it for the emperor? And how much more so for those near at hand!\n\nThe truly great and luminous mirror, darkly discerning the subtle and spiritually weighing all things, perceives with clarity what lies hidden—gazing upon mountains, it recognizes uncut jade; facing rivers, it knows true pearls. Thus, even amid the most difficult distinctions, it makes no errors of acceptance or rejection. By this means, judgments are rightly divided, praise and blame justly apportioned. Were this so, Wu Ding would not have ruled alone, nor would Fu Yue and Lü Shang have remained long cast aside; Wang Mang and Zai Pi would not have completed their evil, and Gong and Shi Xian would have found no place to conceal their deceit.\n\nSuch is the rough outline of selecting men, the general principle of careful choice—yet the subtleties of seeking the right person cannot be fully captured even by the finest brush.\n\n**Case 21: Quelling Litigation**\nMaster Gu’s nephew, Liu Junshi, argued:\n\nThe human order begins with husband and wife, their union modeled upon the Two Modes. Thus, the great rite of marriage was held in highest esteem by the ancients. To join two families in goodwill and continue the ancestral line, the host bowed in welcome at the gate, received the charge in the temple, presented dark and light silks as gifts, and personally handed the reins to the groom. If the groom was in three years’ mourning, the command was given; the bride’s family assented and dared not alter it. After the great mourning had passed, they sought the groom’s permission; only when he gave his word was the marriage finalized. Such was the reverence for deference.\n\nHow could there be litigation before the wedding feast? Yet in later ages, frivolity and disrespect have harmed customs and corrupted morals. Betrothals are promised but not fulfilled, leading to suits that bring shame and clog the courts. Now, let all who dispute marriage before sharing the wedding meat be deemed to have broken their bond, and let the betrothal gifts—wine, silk, and cloth—be returned. Those who have separated once shall repay double the betrothal gifts; those who have parted thrice shall repay triple. Thus, those who separate will have no cause for litigation, and the greedy will find no profit in delay. This is the essential method of royal governance, an enduring law that cannot be changed.\n\n*Baopuzi* replied:\n\nMaster Liu grieves the decline of virtue and deference and laments how litigation harms the people’s transformation. Though he hastens to end lawsuits within families, the value of harmony is not thereby served. He fears the world will sink into mutual ruin, so he devises bold proposals to salvage what has been lost, offering fine plans to rescue a wayward age. By this means, he seeks to replace shameless customs and transform a clamorous society. Yet distinguishing truth from falsehood is inherently difficult.\n\nTruly, this is an enduring law for governing the state, a most beneficial discourse. Yet Hong, being dull and unversed in the highest principles, in my haste to respond, harbor some doubts.\n\nMarriage bonds are formed by mutual consent without coercion—one party selects with care, the other finds satisfaction and thus grants consent. Light promises later regretted incur blame upon the woman’s family, for breaking faith and abandoning trust, seizing or yielding at whim. Though strict prohibitions and severe regulations are imposed, they cannot fully prevent such transgressions. Now, by allowing the unrestrained to indulge their desires and doubling the betrothal gifts, the poor are deterred, while those of ample wealth may fulfill their wishes. Yet if the later suitor proves wealthy and offers to augment the betrothal gifts, the woman’s family will gladly accept. Thus, the first family must remain silent, unable to voice objection. Examining the matter by its true nature, can they not but sigh in resentment?\n\nThose who defy authority regard death as a return home, and from this, bloodshed will arise. If one merely spares them the minor disgrace of litigation while fostering deep, unbearable grudges, it is like cherishing the trivial cost of rent while forgetting the ruinous toll of decay. When purchasing goods in the marketplace, if one raises the price only to seize them, few will endure such provocation without anger. How much more so when the wife one awaits is taken away? Should this law be enforced, those who marry—though they perform the *naji* rites and the bride’s welcoming—will still harbor the fear of seizure. Why? Because Master Liu’s argument fixes the marriage bond at the *tonglao* ceremony. Thus, even if the woman’s family has accepted betrothal gifts for years, they may still wield arbitrary power, confident they can seize her back multiple times. If the groom is dissatisfied, he may repudiate the match, and enmity will swiftly lead to disaster—nothing is more grievous than this.\n\nIn former times, lawmakers carefully considered the entire process, blocking the path at its outset to prevent the sprouting of trouble. Their foresight was keen and unerring. The system of *baoban* (returning the betrothal gifts as a formal rejection) was likely designed with this in mind. Suppose a woman possesses peerless beauty, a face to topple cities, and a figure beyond compare. If she catches the eye of a powerful minister or nobleman, who, captivated by her allure, forgets propriety and decorum, spares no expense—even offering ten times the betrothal gifts—would he hesitate? The House of Hua did not shrink from killing Kong Fu to take his wife, nor did the men of Chu refrain from seizing the bride intended for their lord when they beheld her beauty. By this reasoning, would they scruple to exhaust their household wealth to aid the woman’s family in repaying the first suitor’s betrothal gifts? Petty men, fickle and quick to take offense, readily nurse grudges. They delight in abandoning the declining and pursuing the ascendant, trampling the cold to chase the warm. If this law is enacted, it will surely lead to the poor and lowly being deprived while the rich and powerful prevail. I wonder, what measures does my lord propose to guard against such abuses?\n\nSome suggest: Let the woman’s family receive the betrothal gifts without regard to amount, but require immediate *baoban* (formal acknowledgment of receipt). Thereafter, have witnesses—no fewer than ten—record their names on a separate document to account for those who may travel afar or die. Further, require the woman’s father, elder brother, or paternal uncle to respond to the groom’s family in their own handwriting. If any breach of promise occurs and the evidence is clear, the woman’s parents and brothers shall all be punished. With penalties so severe, might this not bring an end to litigation?\n\n**Admonition on Wine, Twenty**\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity states: What the eye delights in must not be indulged; what the ear takes pleasure in must not be followed; what the nose favors must not be yielded to; what the mouth craves must not be pursued; what the heart desires must not be gratified. Thus, those ensnared by the eye are surely drawn to wanton beauty and gaudy adornments; those ensnared by the ear are surely captivated by seductive melodies and lewd sounds; those ensnared by the nose are surely allured by the fragrance of *chai* and *hui*; those ensnared by the mouth are surely tempted by rare delicacies and fine viands; those ensnared by the heart are surely lured by power, profit, and renown. When all five senses are thus bewitched, the calamities that follow and the harm they bring to the self—are these not indeed to be believed?\n\nTherefore, the wise restrain their nature with stern discipline, curbing the spirit from recklessly chasing external things. They govern it with tranquility, augment it with foresight, and suppress its passions as firmly as one fortifies a dike against bursting. In guiding their nature, they are more vigilant than one who reins in a galloping steed with rotten bridles. Thus, they preserve longevity within and avoid entanglements without.\n\nHunger and cold are hard to endure, yet those of pure integrity refuse grain and silk obtained through unrighteous means. Poverty and lowliness are difficult to bear, yet those of lofty aspiration shun the perilous honors and wealth of turbulent times. For when calculation prevails, the heart remains whole in its capacity for forbearance; when the Dao triumphs, all that harms one’s nature is cast aside.\n\nThe near-flavor of wine and sweet liquor is a poison that breeds illness—though it offers not a hair’s worth of benefit, its harm mounts to mountains. The nobleman corrupts his virtue through it; the petty man hastens his guilt. Few who indulge and become infatuated escape calamity. Men of the world know this truth, yet none can wholly abstain, nor even temper their indulgence. They surrender to the immediate desires of heart and mouth, lightly summoning the very source of disaster, like one parched who gorges on cold drink: though it slakes thirst for the moment, it endangers the body.\n\nFrom minor disorder to total ruin, no misfortune is unconnected to wine. Yet the common crowd remains steeped in revelry. At first, their feasts are solemn and dignified: words are few, demeanor composed, songs like the *Yin Zhu* gentle, melodies like those of *Zai Hao* joyous. They raise cups wishing ten thousand years of life, reciting the virtue of temperate restraint. Before the sun has shifted its shadow, limbs grow light, ears tingle. Vessels of glass and conch shells are filled to the brim; penalties for excess are enforced with haste. Drunkenness knows no end, restraint cast aside like a wheel chock tossed into a well. Mouths foam, noses run, heads drip; order dissolves into chaos. They dance wildly, abandon their seats, clamor and shout as if boiling over like a cauldron. Some argue, insisting on victory; others cackle alone; some prattle without reply; others vomit across the mats; still others collapse. The finest entertainers lose their grace, while the virtuous and steadfast glance about warily. The timid mimic the boldness of Qing Ji, the slow and steady whirl like tumbleweeds, the solemn and composed leap like deer and dart like fish. Those once reticent in cold or heat now clap in unison, their voices harmonized. The meek and unassuming become wildly arrogant, their eyes aloft. The decorum of modesty and shame is shattered, and the maladies of recklessness erupt. Base natures are exposed, and the bearing of arrogance emerges. Spirit muddled, essence befouled, judgments overturned.\n\nSome race chariots or gallop horses toward ravines without fear, treating the perilous Nine Bends like an anthill. Others climb heights and stumble, tumbling into the abyss yet unaware, mistaking the depths of Lüliang for a cow’s hoofprint. Some vent their rage on objects, or pour wine for their wives and children. They heap cruelty upon servants, wield sharp blades against possessions, kindle fires in their halls, cast treasures into the depths, and redirect their wrath toward the innocent. They inflict violence upon friends and subordinates. There are those who have slain their lords or been executed by them, who have provoked superiors and suffered humiliation, who have spoken eloquently yet defied reason, bowed and prostrated themselves in vain. Ministers and children breach propriety before their rulers and parents; the lowly and insolent mock their elders. They call candid speech slander and take loyal admonition as personal affronts. Thus, blades are drawn without thought of peril, cudgels swung without regard for what lies ahead. They provoke blood feuds, invite capital punishment.\n\nTo slight one’s elders is to forfeit respect in the village; to insult another’s father or brother is to invite a blade from their sons and brothers. To speak of what others hold taboo is to rouse the wrath of the strong. To exact harsh reckonings is to find no forgiveness even when sober. A moment’s folly breeds lifelong regret, and a hundred ailments fester in the depths. Even a team of galloping steeds cannot outrun past mistakes. Though one may wish to reform, there is no path back. This is what the wise guard against most deeply, yet the foolish cannot escape.\n\nThe litany of its disasters and defeats is beyond enumeration, yet no gathering abandons it. Cups are raised to the ears, regardless of capacity; dregs are measured by the drop, delay deemed slight. They pour from baskets for those they respect, exhausting themselves in vain effort. To refuse is to invite resentment; to urge is to provoke insult. Thus, flushed faces and ugly words arise.\n\nWind piercing the viscera leaves one disoriented; in severe cases, it brings self-injury and self-reproach. All who suffer such illness are filled with dread, swallowing bitterness and enduring pain in hopes of swift recovery. Yet the sickness of drunkenness is no different—why flee the wind in seclusion but fail to curb one’s passion for wine? If one truly feared the wind and loathed illness, the faults of dissipation would cease, and the errors of indulgence would end.\n\nThe harm of wind is treatable, just as the havoc of wine lies in a single breath. Yet in the throes of drunkenness, the mind is thrown into chaos, clinging to existence yet teetering on oblivion. They see Mount Tai as a pellet, the vast sea as a basin. They howl at the sky as if it were falling, cry out to the earth as if it were collapsing. They lie in wait for tigers and wolves, leap into wells and fires without a thought of peril. How, in such a state, can one uphold the rites of reverence, guard against lapses in joy or anger?\n\nOf old, Di Yi warned Yu of the dangers of wine, yet Yu built mounds of lees and pools of liquor. The tyrants Jie and Zhou perished through it. Feng Hou was punished for raising his cup, Jing Sheng ruined by his three ceremonial goblets. Liu Song rotted his bowels with summer’s cooling drink, Guo Zhen lost his mind to daily drunkenness. Xinling’s excess shortened his life, Xiangzi’s debauchery disordered his rule, Zhao Wu lost the people’s favor, Zifan was executed, Han Hui forfeited his mandate, Guan Fu’s clan was annihilated, Chen Zun met his end, Ji Bu was banished, Zijian was dismissed, Xu Miao was silenced—all by this same vice.\n\nThe world delights in it, loves it in great numbers, yet those who warn against it or fear it are few. Outnumbered, how can good counsel prevail? I can only urge the noble to temper their indulgence.\n\nIn years past, during famine when grain was dear, men killed one another in drunkenness. Governors and prefects imposed bans on wine, issuing strict orders and repeated decrees. Officials searched and seized, flogging offenders. Many were shamed, half were beaten to death. The prohibitions grew ever stricter, yet violations multiplied. Some brewed in underground pits, carried wine in oil bladders, or concealed it in their robes. The people’s devotion to drink was profound indeed.\n\nAs a man of humble station, I append these empty words to the end of this book—what can I do? Moreover, those who govern, though they enact laws, cannot themselves renounce this vice. They relax their own restraints while demanding it of others. Without leading by example, how can the people believe? With such teaching, how can it be effective? With such prohibition, how can it be enforced?\n\nThose who sell wine, if they abandon their trade, face hardship. Thus, they adorn their shops, bribe officials, and rely on the powerful. Local authorities dare not intervene. The powerless alone abstain, while the influential monopolize the market, erecting stalls and cornering profits. They double prices, sell openly, and fear no law. When profit outweighs punishment, who can resist?\n\nSome may object: \"The downfalls of Jie and Zhou, the ruin of Xinling and Han Hui—were these solely the fault of wine? Were they not also undone by sensual excess?\"\n\nThe claim that Bao Si brought ruin to Zhou and thus rulers should abolish their six palaces, or that the peril of Epang led to Qin’s downfall and thus kings should dwell in thatched huts—such reasoning would have Yao and Shun drinking from a thousand goblets and a hundred cups, and Confucius, who knew no limit to wine, deemed capable. The Duke of Zhou never cleared the meat and wine from his table, yet he established rites and composed music. Emperor Gao of Han reveled in grand drunkenness, yet he slew the serpent and rallied his troops. Yu Gong drank a full *hu* and judged cases with greater clarity. Guan Lu downed three *dou* and spoke with dazzling eloquence. Yang Yun kept wine ever at his lips, and the Supreme Mystery was thereby attained. Ziyu drank until he knew nothing, yet his hegemonic achievements were raised high. A single jar of unstrained wine, poured out, gladdened the three armies. The cup that dispels poison, passed around, moved even the horse-thieves to remorse. Joy was completed, rites were upheld, merit was recognized, and spirits descended to commune with men—without wine, how could these be achieved? Within, it hastens the gathering of uncles; without, it welcomes honored guests. Like the Huai and Mian rivers, its value is prized in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. From this, how can one admonish against it?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replies: There are indeed tales of wine-flags lingering from the past. It is like the celestial bodies hanging in the sky, their brilliance unmatched—sun and moon, the origins of water and fire, all reside therein. Yet when regulated and deployed, they nurture life and establish merit; when misused, they burn and drown, bringing death. Can one rely on the celestial bodies in the sky and claim water and fire do not kill? The foremost necessity for life is none other than food, yet overindulgence in eating causes stagnation and masses. How much more so with the poison of wine and sweet ale?\n\nHad Jie of Xia, Zhou of Yin, Xinling, and Han Hui not been swept away by the decadent sounds of亡国, nor drowned in the chaos of倾城’s seduction—all fueled by wine’s fumes, their natures inflamed, their power emboldened by drunkenness—they would not have reached such extremes of indulgence, forgetting the arts of self-cultivation. You trace the branches but miss the root; you call it not the disaster of wine, yet from where does disaster arise? It is like knowing muddy rain soils one’s robes but not recognizing the clouds that produced it, or fearing only the dust that stings the eyes while ignoring the gale that drives it. Tales of a thousand goblets and a hundred cups are baseless words, absurd claims—no wise person would believe them.\n\nThe sages’ distinction lies not in their talent or wisdom extending to their physical forms—none were seven *chi* or three *zhang* tall, nor a myriad times larger than others. How could a single day’s hunger bring them to such extremes? Confucius feared the alteration of his nature and dared not descend into disorder. The Duke of Zhou, though he bowed a hundred times a day and left meat and wine untouched, remained ever vigilant, trembling with caution. If even such sages were thus, how can ordinary men avoid regret?\n\nEmperor Gao of Han, responding to heaven and inheriting the mandate, would have slain the serpent even without drunkenness. Yu Gong was astute and clear in his judgments, weighing matters large and small with fairness, never erring in right or wrong. Thus, punishments were not excessive, the world bore no grievances, and the people were content. His heavy drinking did not impede affairs; if one speaks of great drunkenness, it merely rendered him senseless—what loss was there to his talent for resolving doubts? Never have I heard of Gao Yao, Fu Hou, or Zichan deciding cases while drunk.\n\nGuan Lu was young and rarely engaged in weighty discourse, so he borrowed wine’s influence to bolster his courage. Had he exceeded his limit, he would surely have become confused. Yet when he divined the subtle in hexagrams, sought the transformations of gods and demons, observed qi and complexion to determine rise and fall, listened to birdsong to foresee the future, watched wind and clouds to avert misfortune, or read the steles of Huan to discern fortune and calamity—did he require wine to do so? Yang Yun was a man of broad learning, his thoughts lofty, his intellect vast, his endowment from heaven—how could he rely on external things to aid his writings? His frequent drinking was but a passing preference, or perhaps a means to dispel illness through the power of medicine.\n\nZiyu’s ambitions were long set; even without drunkenness, he would have departed all the same. The joy of the three armies at the jar of unstrained wine was a metaphor: if rewards and punishments are just, authority and favor aptly applied, strategies long and short deployed with timeliness and flexibility, then soldiers will act with resolve, and men will gladly risk their lives. Without such, even if wine flowed like a river, how could it decide victory or defeat? Duke Mu of Qin’s drunken pardon of the horse-thieves was a momentary lapse, an abandonment of law that fostered evil—what is there to praise? How does it compare to caution?\n\n*On the Absurdity of Illness*, Chapter Twenty\n\nBao Puzi said: In the world’s constant flux, ritual and teaching have gradually declined, reverence and deference no longer exalted, while arrogance and rudeness have become the custom. Companions at drinking feasts now squat or sprawl; in the heat of summer, they bare their heads and strip their bodies, their sole concern the games of *chupu*, *tanqi*, and *weiqi*. Their discourse never strays beyond the realm of sensual pleasures, their speech never leaves the company of brocade and fine silk. Their wanderings never depart from the gates of the powerful and the wine-loving, nor do they ever hear words of pure discourse or discussion of the Dao. They take coarse jests and mockery as their first priority, esteeming those who do likewise as lofty and refined, while dismissing those who do not as dull-witted and rustic.\n\nThus, the common rabble and the vulgar crowd admire them as moths drawn to a bright flame, and imitate them as light feathers borne on the whirlwind. Their taunts and jests may target ancestors or descend to wives and daughters. Those who initiate such talk strive to make it as cutting as possible, while those who respond fear their retorts may not be weighty enough. The instigator gives no thought to the consequences of an answer, and the respondent feels shame if his words fail to fully avenge the slight. Like reaping the millet of Zhou or cutting the wheat of Wen, their feuds arise from grievances that cannot be laid to rest.\n\nThose with sharp tongues rely on strength and ally with power; the glib and quick-witted borrow the sting of the *rou* wasp to pierce with the *fen* barb. To fail to respond is deemed clumsy and inferior; to yield first is considered defeat. In such exchanges of enmity, how can one remain silent? Even those of talent and discernment are thus treated by others.\n\nThose skilled in such exchanges rely on circumstances, gauge opportunities, and model their responses on established forms, drawing from antiquity to illustrate the present. Their words are subtle yet reasoned, refined yet amusing, striking the mark without wounding. They avoid what others taboo and do not trespass on what others cherish. As for those who lack such skill—when they speak for others, they distort the straight and force the crooked, leaving their listeners stunned. Whether fair or foul, their words aim only to sever ties, and far from being harmless, they bring only ruin.\n\nThere are those, too, who are quick to anger or of a nature that brooks no offense. Unable to endure, they fling their robes aside, seize thorns, and come to blows. Vile words are hurled at those they once revered; joy turns to enmity, friendships shatter, reputations crumble, and feuds take root. Some hurl cups and goblets; others expose hidden secrets. Of old, Chen Ling was struck by an arrow, and the Guan clan was wiped out—not by fate from heaven, but by the power of words. The pivot of disaster, the arbiter of honor and shame: the warning of the three seals was no deception.\n\nEven thunder cannot retrieve a past mistake; the finest craftsman cannot polish a tarnished word. Though one may not always weigh their words thrice before speaking, a light jest can still quell brewing strife. Honor your speech, respect your bearing—let your words be free of fault, your manner neither haughty nor lax, so that your conduct may be emulated, admired, feared, and loved. This is the art of avoiding disgrace and the essential path to preserving friendship.\n\nMoreover, those who slight others do not love their own kin; those who provoke fights do not value their own bodies.\n\nThose who fall into unfiliality—can one not scrutinize this? Yet the deluded lack self-awareness, and the willful shun admonitions that grate upon the ear. They loathe virtue and lack the needle of forthrightness to pierce their illusions; they are bewildered by confusion and lack the compass of self-reflection. Flatterers and petty men laugh in approval of what is good, while those who feign compliance clap their hands in praise of merit. Thus the deluded remain unaware of their errors, believing themselves possessed of Yanzi’s caution and surpassing eloquence—unaware that this is but the banner that summons calamity, the tally that invites harm, the post-horse that overturns the body’s carriage. Is this merely a matter of diminishing one’s present reputation or tarnishing one’s posthumous renown? Even with lifelong prudence, one cannot undo a single morning’s transgression; even with the wealth of Tao Zhu, one cannot redeem a single misword. A slip of the tongue strays a thousand li; a wounding word cuts deeper than a sword. Small faults accumulate into glaring ones, shallow lapses deepen into ruin. A goose feather can sink a dragon boat, and many light burdens can break a sturdy axle. A gust of wind can burn a towering hall, and a termite can topple a tree of a hundred spans. Why did the ancients tread so cautiously, while modern men are so reckless and arrogant? Thus men of lofty virtue turn away at the sight of dust, while the frivolous and shallow flock like echoes to a sound, shadows to a form. Those who plot affairs lack the aid of the wise; those in peril find no one to admonish them. Good historians hold their brushes, finding no deeds worth recording; eloquent speakers fall silent, their words unworthy of transmission. No fine reputation endures, while shameful rumors spread without end, leaving behind only ruin for future generations—neither a model to emulate nor a record to preserve. This is the disgrace of the aspiring scholar. To persist in error without correction is to abandon the smooth path and plunge into thorns, to forsake sweet springs and swallow wolfsbane. Is this not the very case of deeming small good as unworthy of pursuit and small evil as harmless to indulge, until evil accumulates beyond concealment and guilt grows beyond absolution?\n\nI urge the people of this world to reform their deceitful ways, to cast off their arrogance and stinginess, to rid themselves of boastful and haughty men, and to cease all mockery and improper speech. Then the gates of Zhao Sheng will not turn away guests, and the cudgel of Huang Zu will find no use.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: Some, lacking pure virtue to command respect, rely on brute force to demand fear. When among others, they stand rigidly, refusing to sit, and vie to occupy the highest seat. They scowl and raise their voices, driving others away to assert their dominance. When displeased, they seethe with resentment and refuse to yield. In narrow paths, they refuse to share the way, striding forward with flailing arms, shoving others into peril. If not immediately avoided, they escalate their aggression. Alas! How far this is from the ancients, who, though humble, were never surpassed—yielding the path, deferring to others, modest and unassuming, standing as if their robes could not bear their weight, walking as if their bodies could not contain themselves. How shamelessly inferior are these men! Those of noble conduct and pure integrity, though they may humble themselves, are still esteemed by others. If one’s conduct is not lofty, even if one acts with arrogance, others will not respect them. If one outwardly adopts human form but inwardly loses humaneness, they will be despised, not revered.\n\nIn former times, when Zhuangzi had not yet dined, the King of Zhao stood at his side; when Zou Yan entered Yan’s borders, the lord of Yan swept the path before him. In Kangcheng’s village, the Xiongnu prostrated themselves in homage; in Linzi’s court, none failed to show reverence—not through force, but through virtue. One who amasses wealth through banditry, though rich, is not worthy of praise; one who coerces others through violence, though feared, is not worthy of honor. Yet the common people engage in such acts without shame. Those who hear their words recoil as if a vulture’s cry has sounded; those who see their faces shrink as if a demon has appeared. Wherever they go, it is as if a monstrous omen has descended; wherever they travel, it is as if a pack of tigers has gathered. Fools emulate them, boasting of their boldness; petty men cite them as the first step toward chaos. Disorder has no fixed cause—this is its origin.\n\nYet those who dare to act thus are not necessarily inherently wicked. Most come from families of rank and influence, or doors of power and patronage. They initially perform good deeds to steal hollow reputations, and once their names are vaguely established, their true natures emerge. Some use wealth and beauty to curry favor with the powerful; others exploit the times to attain frivolous honors. Some marry into noble families, while others manipulate praise and slander to align with authority. Their ambitions swell, their demeanor grows unchecked, and their faults multiply. They form cliques and expand their influence, their aspirations soaring, their conduct beyond reproach. No restraint can curb them, no criticism can strike them. They become flies with the heads of eagles, rats within temple walls—wherever they are not yet present, they wield power and fortune to control others. Those superior to them dare not speak, and if they do, they feign ignorance. Those beneath them dare not voice dissent, and if they do, they cannot suppress it. Just as pests harming grain perish with the first frost, so too do flatterers and villains meet their downfall in stern times. The only recourse for those who would preserve their integrity is to refuse to serve them and to decline to imitate them. But without an axe handle, what can one do?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: The *Book of Songs* praises the *suijiu* bird for its distinction; the rites dictate that men and women should not behave improperly. Without a matchmaker, they do not meet; they do not sit together, exchange words, or share objects; they do not hand things directly to one another. Sisters who marry out do not share seats with their brothers upon returning. Words from outside do not enter the inner chambers, and words from within do not leave. Women do not go beyond the door to send off or welcome guests; when traveling, they cover their faces. On the road, men take the left, women the right—such intimacy is already excessive. Moreover, men do not stay indoors during the day unless ill, and they do not die in a woman’s hands—let alone anyone else’s. In former times, the woman of Lu did not seclude herself deeply enough, leading to the scandal of Yuluo; Kong’s wife did not guard her chamber closely enough, sparking the disaster of Hua Du. Shi Ji’s lack of caution brought shame upon her descendants; Wangsun’s loose speech led to her confinement. Yet today, common women abandon their proper duties and neglect their weaving and spinning. They idle about, forsaking household chores to cultivate social visits, traveling to see relatives by starlight, torches in hand. Their retinues fill the roads—maids, servants, officials, and soldiers mingling like a marketplace. Along the way, they jest and mock, their behavior detestable. Some stay overnight at others’ homes; some venture out at night and return. They amuse themselves at Buddhist temples, watch fishing and hunting, climb heights, gaze upon waters, travel beyond their borders for celebrations and condolences. They ride in open carriages, curtains drawn, traversing cities and towns, drinking and toasting along the road, singing and playing music, each vying to outdo the other. Such improper habits become custom, leading to all manner of impropriety. The source of licentiousness is not urgently addressed. To govern one’s household, one must first set an example for one’s wife. I hope that gentlemen will slightly curb such behavior, ensuring that women have no external affairs—this is how to guard against subtle faults.\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity said: Frivolous men tread the paths of the lofty and profound, forming bonds through wealth and patronage, and once their rank and position are roughly secured, they turn their backs on ritual and rebel against teaching. Claiming to follow their nature and talent, they refuse to conform to norms, forcing themselves into unbridled abandon. They deem arrogance and lack of restraint as magnanimity, and those who cherish caution and integrity as petty and narrow. Thus, when the year-end drums sound, the idle and dissolute—white-haired dogs and drunken ears—gather in cliques, banding together to roam without discernment. Extraordinary scholars and great Confucians may live just beyond the fence, yet they pay them no heed. Wherever their whims take them, though distant, they must go, hand in hand, sleeve linked to sleeve, to wander and assemble. They enter others’ halls and chambers, gaze upon their women, pointing out flaws and praising beauty, judging ugliness and comeliness. What is the purpose of such behavior?\n\nSome, finding the master of the house unapproachable, gather at the front gate, putting on airs and finery. If their demands are not met, they no longer merely peer and eavesdrop but break down doors, scale walls, and bore through gaps, as if raiders or bandits have arrived. If concubines or maidservants hide but are discovered, they search out secluded spots and drag them forth—how monstrous!\n\nThe gentleman, even in his own home, does not expose his family’s unpreparedness. Upon entering a gate, he raises his voice; ascending the hall, he lowers his gaze. Yet these men barge into others’ homes—what principle justifies this? Nevertheless, rootless and spineless men, eager to follow the crowd, regard those who engage in such behavior as intimate friends and those who refuse as discourteous. They truly believe this is how the world must be. Thus, they clamor and crowd into rooms, gazing upon wives, squeezing onto narrow seats, exchanging cups at close quarters, singing lewd and seductive tunes to stir the passions of the fair, howling and clamoring, jesting and mocking, exhausting every vulgarity and obscenity. They laugh at the great virtues of men, trampling propriety and decorum. Jie’s downfall, Zhou’s ruin, the Zhou’s collapse, and Chen’s destruction all stemmed from a lack of ritual—how much more so for common folk?\n\nSincerity that does not arise from the heart renders repeated oaths futile; when intent is fulfilled and spirit attains its aim, even form and vessel may be forgotten. The gentleman’s bonds are forged through the Dao and virtue, through shared aspirations and kindred spirits, thus becoming pure and enduring. The petty man’s connections are bound by power and profit, sealed by familiarity and disdain, thus turning sweet but ending in ruin. Why must they gather in chambers, display intimacy before wives and concubines, and only then divide affection and closeness?\n\nThe ancients, discerning the crooked paths of licentiousness and blocking the inroads of perversity, were truly wise. Those who cultivate such wisdom are gentlemen; those who turn their backs on it are petty men. Yet when prohibitions are enforced, even the inner palace has men who tunnel through walls; when nets are full of holes, the mulberry groves harbor eloping women. If left unchecked and indulged, it is like unleashing a raging fire upon the Yunmeng Marsh or opening the floodgates of a vast reservoir. Can a towering blaze be extinguished with brooms and dustpans, or a deluge stemmed with a handful of earth?\n\nYet custom and habit persist, and all say: “This is simply what the young lords and nobles of the capital and great cities do.”\n\nI often refute them, saying: The Central States are the very source of ritual—could ritual truly be thus? Such practices arise from decline and disorder, not the customs of a well-ordered age. Even Laozi, paragon of purity and emptiness, dared not indulge his desires, lest they disturb the mind’s clarity. If even a man of Liuxia Hui’s spotless conduct and lofty virtue, after repeated encounters, could not prevent passion from stirring within or desire from showing on his face—how much more so for others? Those of indifferent temperament are rare as one in ten thousand, and those who suppress their feelings are even harder to find. Can such conduct be allowed to grow?\n\nThough impoverished scholars may recognize the harm in these customs, lacking both reputation and influence, how can they correct them? I have often lamented this, earning only the scorn of my peers, who call me rustic and unrefined, unable to adapt to the times. Yet I hold fast to my convictions—why should I abandon what I know to be right for what others deem acceptable? Such sighs are not few, but alas, what can I do? Those already steeped in depravity and sinking into ruin—how could they heed unwelcome truths or turn back from their distant, errant paths?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: Among the common folk, there is a custom of humiliating women—mocking them with vulgar words, demanding insolent replies in crowded gatherings before their own kin. The shame and degradation are unspeakable. Some are pinched and beaten, others bound and hung upside down; drunken guests, unrestrained, inflict injuries so severe that blood flows and limbs are broken. How lamentable!\n\nThe ancients grieved at partings without candlelight, mourned for parents without music. Ritual texts deem marriage shameful to celebrate, not to congratulate. Yet people today cannot even uphold these old traditions. Those who are respected in their villages, whose words carry weight among scholars—should they not sternly correct such behavior? Why follow the current and perpetuate these vile customs?\n\nYet these practices have persisted so long among the people that none recognize their wrongness. Gentle persuasion cannot curb them; only harsh punishments could stop them. Thus, the teachings of Zhou are scorned, and Confucius is slandered. Reckless abandon is hailed as transcending the world. Some seize power through upheaval, others rely on powerful patrons to soar and gather. Then they grow arrogant, boastful, their airs towering, their strides haughty, their gazes distant. They are self-satisfied, looking down on those who lag behind or lose their way—even the truly exceptional are dismissed like weeds.\n\nSome recline on pillows to receive guests; others feign illness to avoid them. They expect scholars to crowd their gates like forests, their carriages to choke the lanes, and call this the mark of nobility—claiming it cannot be otherwise. Yet by the measure of power and rank, the Duke of Zhou was diligent in welcoming guests with utmost courtesy. By the standard of reputation, Confucius was patient and encouraging in teaching. Both took humility and hard work as their duty, never prizing arrogance. But by the late Han, all had changed.\n\nDisheveled and unkempt, some received guests without belts, others sat barefoot with legs splayed. At gatherings of friends or outings for pleasure, none spoke earnestly of self-improvement or the cultivation of virtue. No one discussed the subtleties of the Dao or the essence of its teachings. When they met, they no longer inquired after each other’s well-being or reminisced about separations. Guests would enter shouting for servants; hosts would watch for visitors while calling for their dogs. Those who did not act thus were deemed unworthy of friendship. When feasting together, they squatted like foxes or drank like cattle, competing for food, tearing at meat, grabbing and snatching without restraint. All sense of shame was lost. Those who joined in were praised; those who refused were scorned as inferior. All day, no word of moral principle was spoken; all night, no beneficial admonition was given.\n\nThey misrepresented Laozi and Zhuangzi, prizing reckless abandon over restraint, dismissing minor courtesies as beneath the \"perfected person.\" Unrestrained arrogance was called embodying the Dao. Alas! How pitiful—how sorrowful!\n\nThus, they mocked their kin to entertain guests, exhausted debauchery to forge bonds, and leaned on each other to display affection. Those who stretched their legs were praised as graceful and refined; those of dignified bearing were dismissed as rustic and dull. Those who spoke with authority were called overbearing and rigid; those who answered clearly were accused of rudeness and abruptness. All these frivolous, glib men—though skilled in flattery and quick to form cliques, mutually praising and promoting each other for swift success—were in truth shallow and hollow, like the gourd-vessel metaphor of the Shu people. Their chests held not a single line of classic texts; their knowledge extended no further than wine and meat. They were the \"arrogant and fierce\" who obscure virtue, the \"reckless and greedy\" who covet wealth and gluttony—the \"worthless sons\" described by Zuo Qiuming.\n\nIf asked about the subtle words of the ancient texts, the workings of gods and spirits, the transformations of the myriad things, the wonders of distant lands, the great rites of court and ancestral temples, the ceremonies of suburban sacrifices and grand offerings, the origins of the Three Beginnings and Four Commencements, the principles of yin-yang and the calendar, the regulations of military and state affairs, or the differences and continuities of ancient and modern institutions—they would be stunned, speechless, shifting uncomfortably, at a loss for words. Though inwardly they might sense their ignorance, like facing a wall, they would never admit their shortcomings. Instead, they would forcefully boast: \"Trivial old stories—those are for pedantic scholars who chant over dead texts and grovel in dusty alleys. Such things are beneath us!\"\n\nThey know the harm of ignorance and the value of great scholars; they recognize the errors of their habits and the folly of their ways. Yet they remain deluded, clinging to their old, dissolute ways, for these do not hinder their advancement. If a noble person were to rebuke them with stern words, even those who defy authority and persist in evil would surely be startled, their hearts melting like ice, their faces changing. They would turn and flee—but alas, such a day will never come.\n\n*Baopuzi, Outer Chapters, Scroll 2*\n*(Subcategory: Daoist Works, Baopuzi Inner and Outer Chapters)*\n\n*The Imperial Four Treasuries: Baopuzi Outer Chapters, Scroll 3*\n*By Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty*\n*Chapter 26: \"Mocking Delusion\"*\n\nBaopuzi states: When the turbid and the clear were first sundered, the myriad creatures came to life. Among the feathered kind, some could converse; among the furred tribes, some spoke with wisdom. Gibbons knew the way home, and cranes foresaw the future. Dark birds divined yin and yang, while ants discerned distant springs and streams. Even the tortoise and milfoil could not surpass them, nor could Gan De and Shi Shen outdo them. Yet only humans, lacking propriety, fail to rank among the noble by nature.\n\nIn the earliest times, the people knew no hierarchy. The supreme sages lamented the crudeness of such chaos and pitied the baseness of dwelling in nests and caves. Thus they built beams and roofs to separate from the flocks of birds and beasts, and established rites and ranks to distinguish the gradations of dignity. They taught the people to turn and bow, instructed them in yielding and deference. When standing, they bent like a full vessel; when saluting, they clasped hands like drumsticks striking a drum. They regulated the steps of approach and retreat, the postures of gazing and standing, the manners of facing and responding. The *Three Hundred Rites* served as the dike against excess and deficiency—this was the people’s great concern.\n\nThus, solemnity crowns the *Qu Li*, and a dignified countenance heads the *Five Constants*. When stepping out, one maintains the reverence due to guests; when at leisure, one heeds the caution of solitude. Yan Hui composed his bearing even at nightly ablutions, while Zhong You tied his cap-strings in the face of death. To guard against even momentary lapses into carelessness—this is how to secure peace above and govern the people below. Without this, nothing can suffice.\n\nA person’s possession of propriety is like a fish’s possession of water. Though a fish may briefly survive without water, its withering is inevitable. A person who abandons propriety, though still breathing, has already stepped onto the path of ruin. Lu adhered to the Zhou rites, and no enemy troops invaded; Wei followed Ganku’s example, and raiding armies turned their banners. The state of Chu, though armored in a million men, was mocked for its withered might; Qin, though it seized the passes of Xiao and Han, found no willow groves to break its fall. Was this not the consequence of casting aside the Three Foundations and severing the roots of reverence?\n\nHow much worse in times of ease and indulgence, when chaos endures and the winds of instruction decay? The rites of restraint are discarded, and manners of simplicity are lost. Those who draw near to others now encounter a decline in governance; the common people suffer the collapse of the Dao’s guiding threads. It is like fish leaving the water or nets, or beasts escaping to the open land—trapped without refuge.\n\nSince the onset of turmoil, the forms of things have shifted repeatedly. Hats and shoes, robes and sashes, carriages and implements—all have changed with the sun and moon, never settling into constancy. Now long, now short; now broad, now narrow; now high, now low; now coarse, now fine—their adornments shift without pattern. Those who delight in novelty mimic these changes morning and evening, so that what the capital’s elite favor—great brows and distant temples—is imitated even in distant lands, where half the forehead is shaved.\n\nI, in truth, am but an ordinary man, clumsy at following custom. My attire and possessions cannot keep pace with these endless changes. Where no harm comes from remaining unchanged, I have never altered them. Though I am mocked and pointed at, I pay no heed. Not that I stubbornly defy the crowd—truly, I see no need to change.\n\nThe superiority of the Central States in most matters over the lands south of the Yangtze is undeniable, yet not all their ways are without flaw. The noble man, in practicing ritual, does not seek to alter local customs—this is why, when traveling to foreign lands, he does not abandon the laws of his native place. How much less should one, in the very land of one’s parents, discard established practices to forcibly adopt new ones?\n\nIn calligraphy, Wu boasts masters such as Huang Xiang, Liu Zuan, and Cen Boran, while Zhu Jiping stands as a peerless hand of his age—just as the Central States have Zhong Yuanchang, Hu Kongming, Zhang Zhi, and Suo Jing, each excelling in their own style, all possessing ancient forms and fully meeting the demands of their craft. Yet I say: to abandon a long-practiced method and laboriously study the calligraphy of the Central States is still unnecessary—how much more so when it comes to altering one’s speech to imitate another tongue? Failing to achieve the ease of the original and instead earning ridicule for one’s clumsiness—this is like the man who, unable to master the steps of Handan, crawls away in shame. Such folly is but a minor matter.\n\nWorse still are those who, in mourning, mimic the wailing of the Central States, their cries suddenly devoid of genuine sorrow. In ancient times, Zhong Yi and Zhuang Xi never forgot their native accents, and the sages approved. Confucius said of one who has lost a parent: \"It is as if an infant has lost its mother—how could such wailing be mere ordinary sound?\" Better that grief be abundant even if ritual falls short, for weeping is but the venting of sorrow—what does refinement or clumsiness matter? Yet now some polish their tones, which is far from true anguish.\n\nI have also heard that among the elite in deep mourning, some, when ill, consume mineral powders with frequent meals, suspending medication to drink wine as if it were their very lifeblood. When illness grows critical and they cannot endure the cold, they allow curtains, bedding, and cushions to be arranged as they please. Thus, even men of talent and strength among the lowly no longer remain in the mourning hall but retire to separate chambers with high beds, thick quilts, fine food, and strong drink. Some even drink with close companions, draining their cups and tossing them aside until they sink into drunkenness, claiming this is the way of the capital. Is this not lamentable?\n\nIn my own village, the virtuous elders of former times, when facing grave hardship or illness in old age, adhered to ritual: though sackcloth remained upon their bodies, they did not allow grief to destroy them. They ate gruel, their mouths untouched by sweetness. Even the unworthy of later times could not help but look up to them. Yet now, men bring such misfortune upon themselves—how vast is the distance between then and now!\n\nIt is commonly said that those in the Central States who observe mourning are excessively extravagant, but this is not so. I have heard that during the mourning periods of Emperors Xuan, Jing, Wen, and Wu of Jin, all emaciated themselves beyond the prescribed limits and did not follow the Wang clan’s twenty-five-month ritual, instead observing a seven-month mourning period. At the time, all in deep mourning throughout the realm took these four emperors as their model. How is it that people today have not heard of this and falsely slander the refined? Is this not confounding?\n\n*Critique of Arrogance, Twenty-Seven*\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: \"Born into...\"\n\nThose born into esteemed families or raised in positions of blazing influence often do not seek arrogance—yet arrogance comes to them of its own accord. Only those of extraordinary capacity can avoid the excess of self-satisfaction. For when one toils in humility and self-restraint, many gather to support him; when one is haughty, slow, and proud, many swiftly depart. Herein lies the pivot of survival and ruin—how can one fail to weigh it carefully? Is this not a grave delusion?\n\nThere are also those who rise from lowly origins, their caution hardening into display: they hunch their shoulders, shrink their steps, bow deeply, stand sideways, lower their brows, bend their knees, and cling to the powerful. Through connections and maneuvering, they leap ranks out of turn, sprouting wings and shedding their former selves like cicadas molting from the earth. Soon they strut, eyes no longer scanning the ground, their vessels full, their hearts content, regarding others as mere mustard seeds. Some cluster in dense crowds, their pipes and flutes clamorous, guests filling their gates until they no longer receive them. Even among those they once associated with, they may favor a few, though such favor is rarely fully deserved. It is merely that their pursuit was more diligent, their visits more frequent, their gifts and flasks never absent. This is what Mencius called \"loving without respecting—treating them like swine and cattle.\"\n\nYet many claim this is the way of self-respect. The way of self-respect lies in humbling oneself before the lowly to cultivate one’s character—not this. Such behavior is but the corruption of a declining age, a chronic malady of a rotting custom. How tragic that so many partake in it!\n\nAs for those of towering stature and vast capacity, whose bearing is free and whose spirit soars far beyond, who walk alone in solitary grace, content in the ebb and flow of the world—whose spirit ascends beyond the Nine Heavens, whose Dao is complete within, who leave the external world behind, whose hats are tattered, whose shoes are worn, whose belts are frayed—how could they deign to compete with vulgar men for petty advantages, to flatter and fawn for favor, to mimic the fawning sycophants of the imperial gardens, or to buzz like spring cicadas and summer flies? If judged by appearance, they are found wanting in refinement; if measured by worldly standards, their coarse simplicity obscures their profound spirit. People see only their rough exterior and cannot perceive the depth of their essence, attending to the skin but not the heart. Though they hold hidden brilliance and embrace the extraordinary, surpassing their age in every deed, their words could awaken the world to truth, their speech could resolve the confusions of past and present, their wisdom is boundless, and they speak only of the Dao—yet a thatched hut cannot contain their thunderous resonance, nor can a dwarf block the radiance of their sharp blade. Thus, fools mock them as common and dull. Only one like the man of Hanbin could recognize a pearl in a muddy clam; only one who weeps blood could discern a night-glowing jewel in the depths of a dark ravine. The firefly swarms in the mosquito’s brow, the giant roc soars beyond the sky; the minnow dwells in the hoofprint’s water, scorning the leviathan that crosses the sea. Their paths and wisdom do not intersect—how can they align? There is no cause for surprise. Those who resent them cannot remain silent, for they wish that gentlemen in office would not judge others by their arrogance, but instead encourage humility to uphold the celestial order.\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: \"When people today hear of Dai Shuluan or Ruan Sizong defying convention and indulging their eccentricities, they call it magnanimity, failing to measure their own capacities. These men were no peers of the truly proud, yet their imitators now cause chaos: some bare their necks and go hatless, some strip and squat like barbarians, some wash their feet in crowds, some relieve themselves before others, some keep guests waiting while they eat alone, or serve wine only to their favorites. Such behavior belongs to those beyond civilization—it is no delight for those within it.\n\nEven Dai and Ruan, with their talent and learning, suffered for their unchecked eccentricities; their gains never outweighed their losses. Had these two lived with restraint, conducting themselves with reverence and caution, engaging others with earnestness and managing affairs with care, where could they not have gone? How much more so for those far beneath them who emulate their ways—they will hasten their own ruin before the sun sets. How could they not be met with disdain, let alone be esteemed for their purity?\n\nLong ago, when Xishi clutched her chest in pain and lay by the roadside, her beauty and fragrance drew all who saw her to admire her and pity her suffering, lingering in concern. Then a neighboring woman, envying her, feigned illness and collapsed by the path. But her ugliness and foul stench repelled all who passed; they scowled, covered their noses, and hurried away. Today, those without Dai and Ruan’s natural disposition who imitate their arrogance are like that ugly woman, blindly measuring herself against a standard beyond her.\n\nEven emperors treated the Three Elders and Five More Elders with the respect due to teachers, for they led by example in reverence. One who lacks propriety invites deep reproach. He who is slow with others will not honor his own kin. If one wishes to be respected, one must first respect oneself. To neglect good deeds is to become evil; to avoid great matters is to remain small. King Zhou’s tyranny earned him the title of ‘lonely man,’ while Confucius, a mere courtier, was called the ‘uncrowned king.’ Thus, the noble man is not defined by wealth or rank.\n\nNow, to engage in conduct that violates propriety yet resent hearing reproaches of swift death is like carrying a pig and hating others for calling it foul, or wallowing in mud and resenting others for calling it filth. Long ago, Xin You saw men with unbound hair performing sacrifices and knew the Rong would soon flourish. I observe that in the time of Huai and Min, arrogance and rudeness were already common, and later the Qiang and Hu invaded and plundered the capital. Only then did people realize these were the omens of earlier misfortune.\n\nNow, as the realm turns toward peace and renewal, how can we not correct past errors and cultivate the beauty of order? One who enters a pack of tigers and wolves only later appreciates the strength of the swift runner; one who lives in a society where propriety has decayed only then understands the steadfastness of the refined. As the Dao declines and the world retreats, worthy scholars and Confucians should grieve together, strike their hearts in shared lament, and correct these ills. If their strength is insufficient, what then? They should at least maintain their integrity like the bamboo and pine, unchanged through the coldest winter. How can they instead rush to join the mediocre, seeking favor with such men? They stray ever farther from the Way—how grievous this is!\n\nYet some stand firm in their principles, unwavering, not swaying like tumbleweeds to follow the crowd, not altering their elegance to mimic vulgarity. No one can hate them, for all recognize their goodness. But those who expect others to be unlike themselves will despise and reject them. Alas! Is this the way of a declining age? The noble man can remain lofty, upright, and unyielding, unswayed by俗, stirring clear waves to cleanse the murky flow, wielding sharp arrows to pierce the crooked. He may not be accepted in his time, nor gain wealth or rank—but if the heavenly nobility remains within him, he stands alone. Even if he does not succeed, what sorrow or regret could he have?\"\n\nYet how exhausting it is—to fell the root and patch with tiles, to feed on dregs and dig in mud, to sever one’s feet to fit the shoes, to destroy the square to fit the round! The steadfast man cannot prevent others from hating him, yet the Dao cannot be bent. He cannot prevent others from humiliating him, yet his conduct remains his own. He cannot prevent others from casting him out, yet his integrity cannot be altered. Thus, once his lot is fixed and his resolve set, neither encouragement nor discouragement can sway him; joyful acceptance of Heaven’s decree and knowledge of fate keep sorrow and fear at bay. Though hardship and distress may press upon him, he grows only more steadfast; though adversity and misfortune may assail him, he does not regret. One who can truly devote himself thus—how could he ever drift like grass or duckweed, seeking to force a square peg into a round hole? Would he ever do what ritual discards?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: I have heard that in the late Han, those without conduct ranked and graded one another. The haughty and arrogant, those who refused to submit to the discipline of the Dao, became the leaders and heroes, the \"four-cornered and eight-reaching\" men. All turned their backs on ritual and teaching, following instead wanton perversity, slandering the upright, and attacking the blameless. Their cliques mouthed foul words and practiced base deeds—all their doings were too shameful to speak of. The ancients spoke of \"understanding and penetrating\" as grasping the Dao and attaining to humaneness and rightness. How could they have meant understanding and penetrating licentiousness and debauchery? Such men are like Robber Zhi, who claimed to possess the Way of the Five Constants. This vulgar corruption of human judgment is more grievous than the coming of bandits and thieves—yet its damage cannot last long, nor is it merely a matter of ruining one’s robes.\n\nAs for the scions of noble houses and those in office, who scorn the laws and appear bareheaded, stripped to the waist, and squatting before guests—having disgraced their heavenly offices, they corrupt the common folk and the young. Some of these men may possess pure and upright natures, or they may be frivolous and vain in reputation, yet they personally engage in such conduct. The common people then take this as the finest way to establish oneself in the world. Those who uphold ritual restraints find it bitter and difficult, and such men are often poor and lowly. Those who indulge in arrogance and abandon find it pleasant and easy, and such men are often eminent and successful. Thus, the vulgar all abandon the former and flock to the latter.\n\nIn the world, some who in youth lacked pure and unsullied conduct later gain wealth and rank through buying office, or perhaps their knowledge suffices to adorn themselves, and their cliques suffice to promote one another. The unprincipled then point to them as proof: \"Those who indulge their passions suffer no hindrance to their brilliance, while those who bind themselves to the Way cannot escape poverty and lowliness.\" Yet they do not know that those who rise to glory do so by luck, and those who suddenly fall do so by misfortune—neither outcome stems from their conduct.\n\nAs for these \"four-cornered and eight-reaching\" men, they cherish those who attach themselves to them. For such followers, putting on shoes is too much—tying their belts is too slow. They enter hand in hand, sleeves linked, ascending the hall and entering the inner chambers. When they go out, their carriages press close; when they guard a pass, they charge straight through. Those who bestow favors receive much; those who make requests are always heard. Their desires are invariably fulfilled; their words are always indulged. When they are in trouble, they are rescued. When they recommend someone, even a lame donkey is priced like a dragon steed. When they slander someone, even a filial son is spoken of as if he were Shang Chen. Thus, the rush of petty men toward them is like breaching a dam a myriad blades high to release pent-up waters, or setting a raging fire to the withered grasses of Yunmeng Marsh.\n\nDesire and ambition, solemn and harmonious, flourish in orderly succession—yet this is like scorching ice to make it burn or piling dry ashes to kindle a blaze.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Hundred Li**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: The Three Ducal Ministers and the Nine Chamberlains sit and discourse on the Dao, while provincial governors and prefects grasp the net’s headrope and lift its mesh. The higher their office, the graver their cares and the more onerous their duties. Of these, none is weightier than the hundred-li magistracy. For it is here that the clamor of exactions and demands converges. If the governor or prefect is worthy but his magistrates and district chiefs are unequal to their tasks, the affairs of state will not be set in order, and the ten thousand mechanisms of government will fall into disarray. The damage wrought will not be confined to a single jurisdiction.\n\nMagistrates and district chiefs ought to be men of the highest caliber—yet they are often inferior to officials of the central ministries. The reason for this is no mystery: it lies in the failure to act with perfect impartiality and the persistence of private favoritism. Some are the sons or younger brothers of the powerful, appointed on the strength of their family’s reputation; others are mediocrities advanced through the intercession of influential patrons. Some are chosen because of long-standing personal ties, others because of kinship or other connections. Though their unfitness is known, they are still appointed. Occasionally, such men may prove competent, but they are far from universally so. The majority are unworthy.\n\nFew are those who strive to prove their worth, diligently adhering to frugality and integrity, laboring day and night in the public service to earn the people’s praise, fearing that their achievements may fall short, ashamed that their patrons’ judgment may have erred. The common run of men, narrow in capacity and limited in aspiration, are driven by greed, seeking only to enrich themselves. They indulge their desires without restraint, commanding with a mere glance or gesture. Local officials, knowing they can rely on their superiors’ support, dare not impeach or censure them. Instead, they fear making enemies and thus suffer their rapacity and cruelty in silence.\n\nHow, then, can the common people avoid suffering and rebellion? When rebellion spreads, they have no choice but to band together as outlaws. A towering hall may be shaken by a breeze no thicker than a hair; a thousand-foot dike may collapse because of a single ant-hole. How can such dangers not be guarded against with the utmost vigilance? How can they not be eradicated at their source?\n\nYet those who wield the scales of office often weigh candidates by their own whims, while those who hold the axe of authority bend the measuring line to favor their own. Since they do not select men for office on the basis of merit, and since those seeking office do not consider their own fitness, governance decays and order unravels. Some officials are muddled, arrogant, and extravagant, oppressing the people; others are harsh, cruel, and tyrannical, provoking resentment and rebellion. Some are dull, withdrawn, and indolent, leaving affairs in chaos; others are careless and negligent, allowing institutions to crumble. Some delight in launching grandiose projects, exhausting the people’s strength; others harbor fugitives and bullies, terrorizing the populace. Some, ignorant of the law, are deceived and obstructed; others, addicted to music, wine, and sensual pleasures, neglect their duties. Some waste their days at weiqi and gambling, abandoning their responsibilities; others hunt and feast, forgetting the people’s affairs. Some, failing to review petitions and lawsuits, throw the judicial system into disarray.\n\nWhen the people can endure no more, they rise as bandits and rebels. Once the outbreak is reported and the culprits are bound in the thornwood stocks, the ruler’s wisdom is impugned, the penal codes multiply, and the people’s suffering deepens. Appointing the wrong man is like harnessing a wooden horse with ornate trappings—how can it gallop to keep pace with the wind? Or like yoking a broken-down nag to a dragon’s chariot—how can it shine with radiance in the celestial thoroughfares?\n\nIf those who hold the reins of state and dispense the sovereign’s commands would but scrutinize the glances of a Liang Yue, ensuring that no lame or inferior steed is mistakenly placed among the fine steeds, and if those who lack self-awareness would fear stumbling mid-journey and thus refuse to harness a broken-down nag to the phoenix’s yoke, what cause would there be to worry that the myriad affairs of state would not flourish? What concern that the four frontiers would not be pacified? The Three Sovereigns would not be so far beyond reach, nor the Five Emperors so difficult to emulate.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Drawing Close to the Obscure**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: When a man of outstanding talent encounters a ruler of great discernment, their bond is as firm as metal and stone before the mulberry and catalpa have even begun to wither. When a man of superior ability meets one of profound insight, their mutual understanding is assured without need of trial. Soaring like a swan borne on a mighty wind, gliding like a dragon ascending through startled clouds—how could such a man be neglected because of lowly station?\n\nIf obscurity and neglect could be dismissed with indifference, then Jiang would not have served the Zhou. If remoteness and humble birth could be justly spurned, then Mao Sheng would not have been honored in Zhao. If long-cultivated conduct alone determined advancement, then Ning Qi would not have risen to prominence in Qi. If high repute and established name alone secured office, then Chen Ping and Han Xin would not have been employed by the Han.\n\nThe wise man looks to the great and overlooks the small; he is neither envious nor grasping. How, then, could he be so petty as to weigh firewood before counting the grains of rice to be cooked? Or discard a jade because of a blemish, or pluck out hairs to search for a mole?\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Weighing the Ages**\n\nSome say: The authors of ancient books were men of great talent and profound thought, and so their writings are abstruse and difficult to understand. Modern writers, by contrast, are shallow in thought and limited in ability, and so their works are plain and easy to grasp. Compared to the obscurity of the ancients, their clarity is like a ditch beside the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, or an anthill beside Mount Song and Mount Tai.\n\nThus, waters that do not issue from Mount Kun cannot swell into mighty currents to flow eastward; books that do not come from men of genius cannot achieve the far-reaching elegance of true literary rhythm.\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity replied: One who is versed only in trivial matters cannot be questioned about the boundless expanse of the nine heavens; one who is confined by narrow conventions cannot be expected to grasp the unique insights of the solitary sage. The men of old were neither spirits nor immortals. Though their physical forms may have been refined in the crucible of time, their spirits live on in the present, and their emotions are revealed in their words. The meaning of their writings can still be discerned.\n\nMoreover, the obscurity of ancient books does not necessarily mean that the ancients deliberately sought to make them difficult to understand. Some of the difficulty arises from changes in language over time, or from differences in regional speech. Others stem from the ravages of war and chaos, the long burial of texts, the decay of bamboo and silk, and the loss of many works. Some texts are fragmentary or incomplete; others have lost entire passages or sentences. Thus, they seem abstruse and profound, though they may not be so in reality.\n\nFurthermore, the *Book of Documents* is a compendium of government affairs, yet it cannot compare in refinement, richness, and splendor to the elegant edicts, military dispatches, and memorials of recent times. The *Book of Songs* is a collection of ornate verse, yet it does not match the vast and resplendent grandeur of the *Shanglin Fu*, *Winged Hunters*, *Two Capitals Rhapsody*, and *Three Capitals Rhapsody*. If this is so, how can the philosophical works of the ancients surpass those of modern authors?\n\nYet the clinging adherents of antiquity, blind and deaf to all else, insist that the ancients’ works are divine and modern writings shallow. They value what is distant and despise what is near—a prejudice of long standing. Thus, a new sword gains value through fraudulent engravings, and a worn-out prescription is treasured because of a forged title. So too, though ancient books are plain and unadorned, vulgar scholars declare them to have fallen from heaven.\n\nThough modern writings gleam like gold and jade, the common crowd treats them as mere tiles and pebbles. Yet ancient books, though numerous, are not necessarily all excellent—they should be regarded as mountains and abysses for scholars, where those who wield the brush may gather timber, hunt, and fish within them. However, just as the forests of Dong’ou and the groves of Changzhou, though abundant with catalpa and elm, cannot be called the grand splendor of towering halls or the resplendent beauty of ornate chambers; and just as the marshes of Yunmeng and the marshes of Mengzhu, though teeming with fish and game, cannot be deemed the lavish feast of simmering broths or the exquisite flavors of fine delicacies—so too do the ancient *Book of Documents* and *Book of Songs* contain principles of meaning, yet they are difficult to surpass in combined excellence.\n\nConsider scholars: all possess virtue and conduct, yet one may excel in literary arts—this cannot be reduced to a single standard. Or take women: all are of peerless beauty, yet one alone masters a hundred skills—this cannot be conflated as identical. If we compare them: in praising palaces, how do the eulogies of Xisi’s *Luqin* compare to Wang Sheng’s *Rhapsody on the Lingguang*? In depicting hunts, how do the poems *Shutian* and *Luling* compare to Sima Xiangru’s *Rhapsody on the Shanglin*? In extolling sacrifices, how do the hymns *Qingmiao* and *Yunhan* compare to Guo Pu’s florid *Southern Suburban Sacrifice*? In recounting campaigns, how do the compositions *Chuche* and *Liuyue* compare to Chen Lin’s mighty *Martial Army*? From these examples, the truth becomes clear.\n\nIn recent times, Xiahou Zhan and Pan Anren both composed *Elegies on the Departed*, such as *White Blossoms*, *Southern Reeds*, and *Luxuriant Millet*. All eminent scholars and refined talents who appreciate literature agree that the *Three Hundred Poems* of old cannot match the works of these two masters. Moreover, the ancients conducted all affairs with unadorned simplicity, while today, nothing escapes embellishment—such is the natural course of changing times and shifting eras.\n\nFine brocade, though lustrous, is no less durable than a straw raincoat; a painted carriage, though elegant, is no less sturdy than a crude cart. Writing is akin to speech: if, in conversation, one speaks as if separated by the vast distance of Hu and Yue, never to be understood, how can such words instruct or admonish others? If clarity and ease are the measure of eloquence, why should books prize obscurity? Just as boats and carriages replaced wading and walking, and brush and ink supplanted knotted cords, later works that surpass earlier ones in excellence are too numerous to enumerate. The world delights in such progress—why then should literature alone be deemed inferior to the ancients?\n\n**Chapter 31: On Reducing Superfluity**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: To pacify superiors and govern the people, nothing surpasses ritual. It weaves the principles of human relations into a comprehensive whole, indeed a meticulous system. Yet why must the rites of capping, marriage, feasting, and archery be so excessively intricate? Though human relationships prize order above all, it suffices to establish distinctions of rank and express reverence—why insist on the endless complexities of ascending and descending, bowing and yielding, kneeling and prostrating?\n\nIn former times, when the realm was at peace and the four quarters untroubled, men of antiquity might occasionally practice such rites. Yet officials would spend months lecturing and testing, enforcing discipline with whips and rods, compelling day and night study at the cost of sleep and meals. After long training, they would be examined for a single day: scroll in hand, they performed the rites, following the text in every gesture. Errors brought demotion or punishment, yet still they faltered, failing to grasp the essence. To make such rites the constant practice of the people would be nearly impossible—just as Mozi said, \"Even after generations of study, one cannot master them; in a single year, one cannot perform them correctly.\"\n\nThe ancients sought counsel from woodcutters and gleaners, heeded the songs of children and the words of madmen, yet still exercised discernment. Mozi’s critiques cannot be entirely dismissed, but his emphasis on penal laws and shortcuts, while addressing practical matters, fails to fully expound the kingly Way. Yet his objections to lavish burials and excessive mourning rites are not without merit.\n\nSince the Jian’an era, the Wei dynasty’s regulations for funerals and mourning have emphasized frugality—here, Mozi’s principles find application. I believe that now, with the chaos of war settled and the realm at peace, the ruler should commission scholars of profound learning and broad knowledge, men capable of adapting and refining without being shackled by foolish conservatism, to revise the *Three Ritual Classics*. They should excise what is unnecessary, trace the origins and evolution of rites, consolidate their essentials, and compile them into a coherent system. Where redundancies, obscure phrases, or divergent expressions convey the same meaning, retain only what is practical and discard what cannot be regularly observed without loss. In the end, the rites should be concise and clear, free from obscurity or stagnation.\n\nFor ceremonial vessels—plates, stands, goblets, and chalices—as well as attire, carriages, banners, colors, palace architecture, distinctions of rank, court audiences, guest-host protocols, funeral and burial rites, suburban sacrifices, ancestral temple ceremonies, and rituals for the altars of soil and grain and the mountains and rivers—all may be simplified to ensure frugality. For frugality eases compliance, reduces expenditure, and minimizes errors in practice. Reduced costs spare the people from harsh levies, while simplicity prevents officials from making mistakes.\n\nThe gestures of bowing, yielding, ascending, and descending should suffice to convey meaning without descending into petty details. Each category should be distinct yet easy to reference. The present *Five Rituals* are a tangled mess of overlapping, contradictory, and redundant elements, their branches and leaves scattered, their repetitions and cross-references multiplying. Even diligent scholars struggle to navigate them, their doubts and objections growing endlessly, their differences unresolved. With each passing year, the confusion deepens, and none but the most discerning avoid bewilderment, hesitation at the crossroads, or exhaustion in the thicket of doubts. They toil and strain, comparing and collating, yet often spend years without resolution, their efforts leaving no room for doubt, their groans and sighs echoing as they dissect and analyze. Their hair turns white in pursuit of such refinements, their days wasted, other pursuits abandoned. The young grow weary and disheartened—truly, the harm is endless.\n\nThe commentaries and exegeses sprawl beyond the original texts. If we were to break them apart, merge them with common practices, organize them by category, and prune the excess, preserving only the essential framework and clarifying the precepts, the result would shine as brightly as the sun and moon, as vivid as the five fixed colors. Scholars would find their labor reduced a thousandfold, and the disputes of pedantic Confucians would cease. Future generations, looking back, would praise our age as we now praise the Zhou.\n\nThis is no different from abandoning stone-boiling or blood sacrifices—there is nothing to fear in such change, no regret in discarding the old, no reluctance like that of pushing a cart or leaving a nest. Yet those who cling to convention, upon hearing these words, will surely stare in shock, calling me a madman.\n\nThe Three Kings did not follow the same music, nor did the Five Emperors inherit the same rites, yet all succeeded in transforming customs, pacifying superiors, and governing the people. Whether they reformed or preserved, added or subtracted, all achieved the same good ends. Why must one ride a boat to climb a mountain, a horse to cross a river, wear armor in the ancestral temple, or don heavy furs in the height of summer?\n\nIf ancient practices must never change, then coffins should not replace firewood, and burial garments should not replace nakedness.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 32: On Valuing the Broad**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: The orthodox classics are the deep seas of the Dao and virtue; the subsidiary texts are the rivers that deepen them. Look up, and they are the bright stars that aid the three luminaries; look down, and they are the thickets that embellish the towering peaks. Though their paths differ, all lead to moral advancement; though difficult to embark upon, all converge in cultivating transformation. Thus, the learned trace the roots to encompass the branches, grasp the guiding principles to attain the ends.\n\nThe ancients lamented the scarcity of talent, saying that worthy successors appear but once in a hundred generations. They did not discard the night-shining gem because it was not from Kunlun, nor did they reject instructive words because they did not come from sages. Thus, even the clumsy poems of village alleys or the crude oaths of military camps—though their language was coarse and their analogies vulgar, though they filled no more than ten slips—were still recorded and arranged. The minor sayings of the Hundred Schools align with the classics, just as different vessels, though varied, all serve to extinguish fires, and different medical techniques, though distinct, all cure illness.\n\nSince the Han and Wei dynasties, the profusion of writings has grown ever greater. Though their meanings plumb the depths of the mysterious abyss and their words surge like waves, their influence can summon auspicious omens from the heavens, evoke blessings from the earth, call ring-necked pheasants from beyond the wilds, and secure the realm within the four seas. Near at hand, they quell the roots of disaster; far off, they bequeath blessings for ages to come. Yet the age lacks sages to assess and order them, so they cannot gallop like fine steeds across a thousand *li* or be appended to the *Three Canons* of antiquity.\n\nThe narrow-minded, shackled by their shallow learning, remain trapped in the trivia of philology, dismissing the extraordinary as worthless. Some call them \"minor arts\" unworthy of study; others claim that breadth confuses the mind. Yet they fail to see that a mountain is made of grains of dust, that a hundred or a thousand can sum to millions or billions. Many colors combine to form the splendor of imperial robes; many sounds blend into the harmony of the *Shao* and *Hu* music.\n\nSome prize the shallow, trivial verses of poetry and rhapsodies while scorning the profound, rich, and expansive subsidiary texts. They dismiss incisive and essential words as dull and clumsy, and praise flashy, trivial eloquence as refined and skillful. Truth and falsehood are inverted, jade and stone mixed together—like equating grand music with rustic tunes, or dragon-patterned brocade with coarse hemp. Alas, how lamentable and regrettable that all drift along in this delusion!\n\nSome argue: \"Though writings may be abundant, they merely polish words and dazzle with ornament—what bearing do they have on gain or loss? Far better is the silent instruction of virtue and conduct. Thus, Yan and Min stand foremost, while Fang and Xia rank next in the fourfold classification. Learning is the root, conduct the branch. Then is not literary composition a mere secondary pursuit? Yet you, sir, do not exalt its source but prize only its flow—is this right?\"\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity replies: \"Virtue and conduct are matters of action, their excellence or inferiority easy to discern; literary composition is subtle in form, its essence difficult to grasp. What is easy to see is coarse; what is difficult to know is refined. Precisely because it is coarse, its assessment has fixed standards; precisely because it is refined, its appraisal resists uniformity. Is it not fitting, then, to set aside the easily seen coarse and discuss the hard-to-know refined?\"\n\nAnother objects: \"Virtue and conduct are the root; literature is the branch. Thus, in the sequence of the four categories, writing does not occupy the highest place. Then are not all writings but the dregs of secondary matters, like straw dogs after sacrifice, their high or low rank plain to see? Might I hear of the essential nature of literature?\"\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity replies: \"One may discard the fish-trap once the fish is caught, but until the Dao is realized, one cannot do without the trap. One may abandon writing once the Way is practiced, but until the Way is enacted, one cannot do without writing. Consider the vast or constrained scope of brushstrokes and tonal patterns, the density or sparsity of phrasing and allusions, the length or brevity of sources and ultimate attainment, the depth or shallowness of implicit borrowing and explicit citation—how immeasurably distant they are! Even the space beyond the heavens or the tip of a hair cannot convey their remoteness. How they vie with one another! Even the radiance of the Three Luminaries cannot compare to their magnitude or minuteness. The sharpness of Dragon Abyss swords or the dullness of lead ingots cannot match their keenness or bluntness. The lightness of swan feathers or the weight of piled gold cannot equal their levity or gravity. Clear and turbid, uneven and aligned, each bears its own master; bright and dim, they differ in kind; strong and weak, each follows its own qi. Yet vulgar scholars, seeing only those who can dip brush and compose, lump them all together as one. This is why Bo Ya forever longed for Zhong Ziqi, and why the man of Ying desisted from wielding his axe. For those who carve and chisel may stand shoulder to shoulder, yet Ban and Di alone bear the title of unmatched craftsmen; those who pluck the zither may be legion, yet only Ziqi grasps the difficulty of true attunement. A thousand steeds may fill the stables, yet only Qiji commands a price beyond measure; ten thousand beauties may be counted, yet only Mao Qiang and Xi Shi possess transcendent allure. Truly, there are those who far surpass the multitude.\n\nMoreover, to compare literature with virtue and conduct is like comparing ten feet to one zhang—yet to call it a secondary matter is unheard of. The celestial bodies that hang in the heavens, the praise accorded to Yao and Shun, the resplendent majesty of the noble man, the flourishing brilliance of the dawn, the posthumous titles bestowed upon sages—all from a single word—were these not all matters of wen? The Eight Trigrams gave rise to the adornments of the simurgh; the Six Jia emerged from the burden of the sacred tortoise. Where wen resides, even the lowly become noble—how can the hide of dogs and sheep compare?\n\nFurthermore, the root need not always be weighty, nor the branch invariably slight. Silk brocade relies on plain cloth; pearls and jade reside in oyster and stone. Clouds and rain arise from a handspan; rivers and seas begin with a foot. Thus, though literature ranks after virtue and conduct, it cannot be called a secondary matter.\"\n\nAnother asks: \"The deeds of the present age often fall short of antiquity, and its writings and compositions are likewise inferior. Is this the natural principle of a declining qi and fortune?\"\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity replies: \"Though the hundred schools' words may arise in succession, they all stem from the thoughts of great scholars and the hands of accomplished talents. Compared to the ancients, they need not all be inferior. Some possess vast, profound, and boundless depths, harmonizing with the ineffable. Their inner sources are unfathomable; their outward flow, inexhaustible. They trace their lineage to the long and expand upon the subtle, their wondrous transformations unbound by the square or circle of fixed rules, their lateral connections unobstructed by the constriction of a single path. Thus, those who favor only sour or salty cannot know their flavor; those whose thoughts are limited cannot grasp their spirit.\n\nThe soaring dragon ascends unhurriedly, gazing back as it scales the clouds; the swift steed strides slowly, breathing as it covers a thousand li. Yet the ant marvels at its stairless ascent, and the sluggish nag resents its gradual surpassing. If one gallops through the midst of poetry and discourse, circling within the bounds of commentaries and records, judging the extraordinary with common sentiment, measuring the boundless with a narrow gauge, seeking the utmost refinement with the crudest tools, or probing the profoundest depths with the shallowest wits—even from childhood to hoary age, one will not attain it.\n\nThose who delight in swiftness will praise it as fine, while those who fail to comprehend will condemn it as foul—such is the natural principle. Thus, what they do not understand, they dismiss as empty and absurd, and though they may revere it out of respect, they do not truly believe it, thereby harming others without intent.\n\nMoreover,世俗 generally venerates antiquity and disdains the present. Though there be steeds that chase the wind, they say they do not match the chariots of Zaofu; though there be treasures worth cities, they say they do not equal the tears of the man of Chu; though there be swords that cleave metal, they say they do not rival the forging of Ou Yezi; though there be medicines that revive the dead, they say they do not compare to the compounds of Bian Que and Hua Tuo; though there be men who surpass the multitude, they say they do not match those recorded in bamboo and silk; though there be books that benefit the age, they say they do not equal the writings left by former generations. Thus, Confucius was not esteemed in his own time, and the *Great Mystery* was scorned by his contemporaries.\n\nVulgar scholars often say: 'Today’s mountains do not match the height of ancient mountains; today’s seas do not match the breadth of ancient seas; today’s sun does not match the brilliance of the ancient sun; today’s moon does not match the clarity of the ancient moon.' How could they ever admit that today’s talents do not fall short of ancient bones? To value what is heard and belittle what is seen is a malady not of this age alone.\n\nIn former times, those who smashed lutes and burned texts surely had their reasons. Such is the thirty-third fault of the Han.\"\n\nBao Puzi said: Surveying the records of former ages, I find no period where the moral defenses of the Dao and the corruptions of custom were more severe than at the end of the Han. Those who held the reins of power—eunuchs and their ilk—grasped the divine regalia and wielded the state’s authority. They deposed the upright and promoted the perverse, harmed the virtuous and indulged their whims. They whispered in secret, turned their backs on those they hated, feigned deafness to truth, and followed the deluded. Kindred evils banded together, drawing in wicked factions, amassing wealth without limit, yet unwilling to disperse even the smallest coin to relieve the destitute and impoverished.\n\nPromotion in office was unattainable without great wealth; justice in litigation was denied without lavish bribes. Though their power and influence were vast, they could not utter even a single word to advance the most eminent talents of the age. Their appointments never extended beyond the relatives of wives and concubines; their favors never reached beyond the circle of their closest attendants. They heeded not the censure of Zang Wen, nor followed the righteous example of Jie Hu’s impartiality. They distributed emoluments to mimic Wang Lin and pursued affairs like the wandering Fang Hui. Thus, men like Liezi filled the streets, yet none received the succor of Zheng Yang; lofty spirits gathered in numbers, yet none encountered the recommendation of Bao Sheng. Independent minds were suppressed, while those who flattered and attached themselves were advanced. This is why Fan Ju covered his mouth in silence, and Feng Tang sighed without end.\n\nAt that time, the prevailing custom was to consume without labor, to conceal one’s virtue, to obscure the worthy, to envy merit and resent it, to slander the pure and white, to shun forthright loyalty and entrap it, to detest those who stood alone and cast them out. The pliant and obsequious were cherished and protected; the upright and unyielding were reviled and abandoned. They nurtured wolves and leopards while slaughtering unicorns and lynxes; they cultivated brambles and thorns while cutting down pepper and cassia.\n\nThus, those who were proud and unrestrained, rolling like pellets or drifting like duckweed, were called magnanimous and great of spirit. Those who were petty, harsh, and treacherous, harboring venom like scorpions, were called just and upright. Those who were glib, clever, and quick-witted, with sharp tongues and petty eloquence, were called refined and discerning. Those who were abrupt, provocative, arrogant, and reckless were called towering and extraordinary. Those who indulged in wine and women, dissolute and shameless, were called untrammeled and unfeigned. Those who sought without restraint, took without scruple, and seized what was not theirs were called lofty and unconstrained. Those with disheveled hair and coarse garments, who roamed and gathered without propriety, were called broadly learned and universally loving. Those who defied the classics, perverted the sages, and parroted heterodoxy were called disciples of Zhuangzi and Laozi. Those who mocked the refined, ridiculed the elegant, bullied their superiors, and treated them with contempt were called free-spirited and refined. Those who destroyed their integrity to conform, who echoed others like an echo, were called unparalleled talents. Those who relied on the powerful, hoarded wealth, and monopolized goods were called masters of adaptability. Those who shirked paperwork and sought empty reputations were called men of great enterprise and lofty ambition. Those who depended on powerful relatives and held positions beyond their ability were called heroic peers. Those who bribed influential families to purchase titles and ranks were called generous and noble. Those who formed cliques for mutual praise, whose deeds contradicted their words, were called cultured friends. Those who practiced heterodox arts and sorcery, invoking ghosts and spirits, were called spiritually attuned sages. Those who practiced divination, deceitfully predicting fortune and misfortune, were called seers of past and future.\n\nThose who excelled in horsemanship and spearplay, possessing the bravery of a single warrior, were called generals of strategic brilliance. Those who abandoned the Dao and virtue, merely echoing the vulgar, were called heroic talents and great scholars. As for those of steadfast integrity and lofty conduct, whose spirits were pure and dispositions vast, who did not ingratiate themselves with smiles nor bend their words to deceive, who bore frost and trod snow without compromising their principles, who upheld the Dao and adhered to rectitude, standing aloof and unyielding—though the wind raged, their branches did not bend; though their bodies were distressed, their resolve did not waver—advancing, they spoke with incisive words and forthright counsel, attacking faults and admonishing shortcomings; retreating, they were sincere and selfless, acting without reservation—these were called dull and benighted.\n\nYet those who rose early and retired late, who diminished their meals to serve the public, who toiled and exerted themselves in governance, were called petty functionaries and vulgar officials. Thus, the wise and perspicacious concealed their brilliance, feigning obscurity; the noble and outstanding remained silent, pretending foolishness. The lowly and humble soared to choose their trees; the constrained and bound conformed, serving as \"court recluses.\" The wise refused to reveal their secrets; the brave did not display their resolve. Loyal and forthright men found retreat difficult; the wicked and treacherous prevailed. The tide of perversity surged unchecked; false paths spread unobstructed. Thus did the age reach such a pass...\n\nWhere superiors were overawed and inferiors neglected, thieves and bandits proliferated. Eunuchs usurped the sovereign’s authority, and the lives of the Three and Nine were held in the hands of mediocre underlings. Loyal and eminent scholars were branded as partisans, imprisoned, executed, or eradicated. The realm groaned in anguish—innocent and blameless men shut their doors only to meet disaster. A wisp of smoke rose from behind the palace screen, and a whirlwind’s conflagration swept through the cosmos. A hairline fissure opened in the skin, and waves surged to the four extremities. The golden fortress was overrun by common brigands; the boiling moat was crossed by a single reed. The keen and sharp melted away at the sight of dust; conscripted soldiers turned their weapons and fled. Flying blades assailed the inner chambers; barbarian robes were looted from the imperial precincts. Millet and sorghum sprouted in the ancestral halls; brambles and weeds flourished upon the jade steps. Cloud-capped towers became dens for foxes and hares; the ceremonial gates of state were trodden into paths for tigers and leopards. The eastern academy was reduced to ashes; the common people were scorched and drowned in the fires of the abyss. The wicked harmed their houses and ruined their states, yet their crimes were inscribed on bamboo and silk. No eulogy came from the upright historian; no virtuous renown was carved in metal or stone. What was the cause? The loss of men.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Loss of Wu**\nMaster Baopu said: The final years of Wu, though separated by eras, suffered the same maladies as before. Having failed in that time, they could not correct themselves in this; though the lessons of chaos and collapse were not distant, they trod the ruts of overturned chariots. Witnessing the scramble for the crossroads, they forgot the disasters that befell them; laughing at the complacency of lice in quietude, they did not perceive that circumstances had changed and calamities were equal. They saw the boats competing to cross sink, yet did not realize that though the paths differed, the drowning was the same.\n\nI was born in the Jin era and did not witness these events, but my teacher, Master Zheng, recounted them in full from personal experience. He often instructed me, saying: The late years of Wu suffered from maladies even more severe. The worthy were not employed; the dregs filled the ranks. The framework of governance collapsed into disorder; laws that could swallow boats leaked everywhere. In tribute and selection, those who offered heavy bribes took precedence; in official appointments, those with powerful factions were favored. Without wealth or influence, one might toil for years without hope. Those of pure virtue and lofty conduct harbored their brilliance in obscurity; those with talent and strength trod the path to the clouds, ascending through office. The ruler was benighted above; ministers deceived below. Without faction, one could not compete; without advancement, one turned against the public good. The customs of betraying the common weal grew ever more severe; the Way of integrity and uprightness was utterly ruined. Thus, the sparrow, startled by the wind, soared to the clouds; the rotting boat, trusting in swift waves, raced like lightning. The phoenix furled its six pinions among thorns; the prow of the yacht stagnated in stagnant waters, its oars unmoved.\n\nThe aides who held the reins and the officials who shepherded the people were either relatives of the empress dowager or flatterers. In office, they offered no loyal counsel to correct errors or supply omissions; in retirement, they lacked the competence to hear lawsuits. In empty talk, their mouths spewed frost and snow; in conduct, they clung to filth and dregs. They wove webs of slander and praise, wielding power and fortune in place of farming. Their carriages and robes gleamed so brightly they could be used as mirrors; their mansions were so grand that flocks of crows perched upon them. Their shouts were swifter than thunder; their blessings and curses faster than spirits. Their influence and profit toppled commanderies; their stores and accumulations enriched the public treasury. When they went out, they were attended by the guards of Di and Huang; when they entered, they strolled among the carved beams of jade. Their retinues formed armies; their gates became markets. Oxen and sheep covered the plains and lowlands; ponds and fields spread for a thousand *li*. Yet outwardly, they feigned the frugality of Yu Qingping and Zhongshu, while inwardly, they emulated the vigilance of Tao Kan and Wen Xin. In truth, they were as corrupt as Anchang, Dong, and Deng. Though they might receive guests, they did not extend the courtesy due even to distant relatives. Starving scholars received not a single measure of grain, yet their halls overflowed with gold and jade, their chambers teemed with singing girls and concubines. A thousand merchant ships rotted with grain; ten thousand granaries brimmed with stores. Their gardens and parks rivaled the Shanglin; their mansions usurped the Taiye. Meat and grain were left to rot for dogs and horses; treasures overflowed their vaults.\n\nIn their dealings with scholars, they showed no kinship, however distant; in their own indulgence, they exhausted every luxury. Some never opened the books of laws and ordinances yet occupied the seat of the Grand Judge; others did not know where their desks were placed yet held pivotal posts. They were ignorant of the names of the Five Classics yet enjoyed the emoluments of Confucian offices; they could not distinguish the cold and heat of a foot-long ruler yet sat in the halls of composition. Their brushes were not reckless, yet they coveted the glory of debate; they lowered their brows and drooped their wings, yet filled the ranks of impeachment. They could not discern the fine or coarse among men yet were entrusted with the governance of appraisal. Ignorant of the military might of the Three Powers, they suddenly found themselves beneath the canopy of authority. Repeatedly, they suffered the shame of routs, yet as generals, they did not lose the glory of the vanguard. Unable to distinguish the difference between beans and wheat, they were sold the near office of imperial counselor. Men of fish-like substance and dragon-like pattern—seemingly fitting yet fundamentally flawed—rejoiced when placed in water but grieved at the sight of a heron. Though threatened with axes and halberds, enticed with the treasures of a fallen city, they could not spur their leaden blades against rhinoceroses or gallop their lame nags to chase the wind. Not that they did not fear severe punishment, nor that they did not desire fine rewards—it was simply that their talents were unequal to the task. What could be done? To entrust them with the illumination of the hundred offices and the harmonious management of great affairs was like placing ten thousand *jun* upon a crimson boat, or seeking a thousand *zhong* in a single *sheng*. To tether straw dogs and demand the prowess of hawks and magpies, or to leash chickens and ducks and expect the soaring might of eagles—such futility was all too clear.\n\nThe lords of Wu did not reflect upon this. They did not add vigilance to their evenings, nor did they employ the flattering and mediocre with heavy responsibilities. The signs of peril and imminent collapse were as evident as the sun and moon, yet they deemed themselves as secure as towering mountains, aspiring to the heights of Yao and Shun. Their eyes were wearied by the dazzle of brocade, yet they did not use this to verify the right and wrong of remonstrance. Silks and grains were squandered on the unworthy, yet they did not use them to relieve the hunger and cold of their soldiers. Their hearts were delighted by flattery, yet they did not use this to contemplate the principles of survival and ruin. They treated the source of rise and fall with levity and neglected the weight of the ancestral temples.\n\nThe Master Zheng further spoke of his teacher, Master Zuo, who lived in reclusion on Mount Tianzhu, neither seeking official emolument nor befriending the feudal lords. Yet his heart yearned for great peace and grieved for his homeland. Thus, he sighed deeply beneath his thatched roof and said to his disciples:\n\n\"The vermilion talisman lies dormant, the yellow essence stirs anew; the pivotal axis is restored at the Supreme Culmen, the purple canopy turns back to the Quail’s Head. To succeed Heaven and govern all things, to illuminate the eastern lands of Xia—let the benevolent breeze spread beyond the borders, let the profound grace fill the cosmos. Tongues of distant tribes press close at court, their tribute of coarse reeds filling the halls. Vast and towering, it reaches above and below, a realm of universal peace.\n\nYet this order is easily sustained, yet the Five Constants lie silent, the *Nanfeng* hymn unchanted. Above, the Way of ‘guarding oneself’ is unattained; below, the song of ‘O how prosperous!’ goes unheard. Flying dragons soar but do not alight; deep-dwelling dragons coil but do not leap. The *zouyu* hides in obscurity; the vermilion blossoms sprout but do not bloom. Yin and yang clash in disharmony; cold and heat transgress their seasons. The Seven Governors warn of peril; mountains and valleys shift their places. Thunder rumbles ominously in the month of the dragon’s seclusion; hoarfrost descends with killing force in the season of summer’s glory. The earth’s torch does not shine; sweet springs do not well forth. Ramparts rise on the frontiers; fine grain does not ripen. What else could be the cause?\n\nTruly, it stems from the Four Perils unremoved, the primal and harmonious not promoted. The employed are unworthy; the worthy are unemployed.\n\nYet the lofty, in their vast forbearance, hold jade within and guard purity of purpose, desireless amid worldly things. Concealing their talents in profound obscurity, they find contentment in obscurity, forsaking the world. Not acting against propriety, not appearing out of season, they endure hardship without distress, poverty without regret. Rejoicing in Heaven’s decree, they merge honor and disgrace, advancing without delight, retreating without sorrow. Such men would rather die in obscurity by their earthen windows—how could they deign to display their priceless treasures to vie with the sale of mere swallow stones?\n\nThe Ways of Confucius and Mozi once went unheeded; Meng Ke and Yang Xiong likewise faced adversity. That virtue goes unrewarded in its time is nothing new. The world lacks the keen-eyed Li Zhu to distinguish black from white; the era wants the swift Guan Qing, its fine steeds broken and bent.\"\n\nAmidst golden coffers lie heaps of worthless gravel, while jades and precious stones are cast aside in ditches and canals. Master Carpenter Shi passes them by in distant oblivion; catalpa and elm go unrecognized. Alas! My time is ill-fated—neither early nor late—soon to witness the land of Wu transformed into Jin’s city walls, its southern folk turned into northern subjects. These words still ring in the ear, and Ge Hong of *Baopuzi* says: “The words of these two gentlemen may serve as a warning for posterity.” Thus I record them here, that future generations may know the fall of Wu was not sent down from Heaven.\n\nIf one were to conceal a state’s ills and refuse even the slightest censure, then Dong Hu’s straight brush would be of no value, and Jia Yi would be mocked for his *Faults of Qin*. **Guarding Obscurity, Thirty-Five**\n\n*Baopuzi* says: Among my friends there is a gentleman who dwells in reclusion, admiring the unclaimed land of Qinshui. He chose a secluded plot to build his home, sharpening his skill in the literary arts while neglecting the plow. Year after year, his harvests fail, and hunger shows in his face. Someone once challenged him, saying: “Understanding ritual begins with a full granary; generosity flows from abundance. Prosperity arises from surplus, while frugality stems from want. The *Poet* praises the ten thousand measures of grain, and the *Eight Governances* place agriculture first. Tilling the soil is the foundation of great virtue; paired plowing brings unchanging joy—the dwelling of extraordinary men. Advance, and you may soar with the phoenix; retreat, and you may join the ranks of Tao and Bo. In office, you would be a Boyi; at home, a Qianjin. Thus the ancients divided fertile fields to share their bounty, toiled with their limbs to sow and reap, scattering beans and millet in lush abundance, nurturing vegetables in orderly rows. They filled a thousand granaries with wheat and black millet, amassed countless bushels in their storehouses. They rode forth in chariots for the hunt, returned in court robes to feast on jade-like viands. Yet this gentleman’s dwelling fares otherwise: in scorching drought, the grain flies away as dust; in heavy rains, the land is drowned. Hills and fields bear no sprouting shoots; waters yield no ripened stalks. Weeds and chaff fill the granary, firewood rots in the kitchen. Still, he clings to his resolve, awaiting the hare at the snare, untroubled by thoughts of advance or retreat.\n\nI fear the fate of Boyi will soon befall him, that the hardship of Danshan will befall him in an instant. Others may grow cold at the thought—why does he remain so unconcerned? He who sees the opportunity yet does not act cannot be called wise. To cling to one’s land without change is the way of the common crowd. How could one who delights in the stench of rotting fish forget the orchid’s fragrance? How could one lost in confusion so easily alter his nature? Why has this gentleman remained so long unaware?” The rustic is perplexed.\n\nHe does not recognize what is meant: the court robes and crowns are not garments to shield against frost and arrows; the classics and canons are not tools to relieve hunger and cold. Why not turn his gaze to the fertile plains of the four suburbs, take up the good work of the field and plow, set aside the impractical Six Arts, and gather a myriad granaries to trade for what is lacking?\n\nThe Reclusive Master replied: “One deaf cannot be urged to distinguish refined music from vulgar tunes; one blind cannot be held to tell cinnabar from lacquer. The frog in the well cannot be spoken to of the vast ocean; the common crowd cannot be instructed in the classics. If you, sir, know only the petty achievements of the old farmer yet fail to grasp the colossal folly of one who faces a wall—what difference is there between gathering grains of sand while discarding a priceless pearl, or turning toward a flickering candle while turning one’s back on the bright sun?\n\nTastes and preferences cannot be measured by a single standard; paths and pursuits cannot be exchanged between self and other. He who aspires to ascend the windswept heights of Langfeng or scale the peaks of Song and Hua will not linger on a molehill. He who intends to cross the Southern Sea and sail the vast ocean—how could he idle in a stagnant pool? Thus, one who lends a clear ear to the *Nine Shao* finds the clamor of the village unable to please his ear; one who feasts on the grandest meats and spreads a banquet of a hundred dishes finds the bitter herbs and smartweed unable to sweeten his palate.\n\nThe roc soars to the crimson clouds in lofty flight; the wren flaunts its wings in the humble thicket. Though their paths through marsh and land differ, each attains the utmost in flight. The moon’s phases pass swiftly—how fleeting the life of the morning mushroom, which knows not the mayfly! In an instant, the wild horses of summer exhaust their breath; the minnows and bream dart about with exposed scales, while the sacred dragon remains unused in the depths. Unfathomable are the ways of action, divergent their intentions—how can one grasp them?\n\nThough my coarse fare may not fill my belly, I am content with a life beyond the need for grand feasts. Thus, Liezi did not covet the salary of Zheng Yang despite his want; Zeng Shen did not trade his poverty for the riches of Jin or Chu. To preserve subtle teachings on the verge of extinction was the distant legacy of Zhou and Kong. To be zealous in the pursuit of profit is to be a criminal in the eyes of Master Meng.\n\nOne who seeks the distant does not tarry at crossroads; one who acts does not attempt to master both plowing and learning. To toil in body while at ease in spirit—what harm is there in living simply? Yet if one dwells in fertile lands and grows idle, idleness leads to neglect of learning, and neglect breeds extravagance. The pure find fortune gathered to them; the extravagant find calamity rushing toward them. When fortune gathers, even the humble may grow extravagant, and even the declining may rise. When calamity rushes in, even the strong may weaken, and even the living may perish. This comes unbidden and arrives unsummoned.\n\nThus, the noble man, wishing to correct what is amiss, must first rectify its root. If he dams the flow, he must first block the source. When the work of Dao and virtue is established, the gates of extravagance and waste are shut. Jiang Wang attained such virtue that his fields no longer needed sowing; Chong Hua, the great sage, fished without casting nets. Then did the jade tablet proclaim the blessings of Yingqiu, and the great merit stood twenty *zhang* high—why then mock idleness or scrutinize talent as if appraising a minister?\n\nThose two divided their wealth, taking the lesser share as sufficient; I now yield the world’s abundance, dwelling in this barren land of hardship and stone, forsaking the rich fields of Anchang for the desireless outskirts of the northern wall. If even the myriad things may be deemed small, what could ever be lacking? The North Star is revered among the stars for its unchanging position; the Five Peaks are honored among the mountains for their immovability. The cricket, though it moves often, is not prized; birds and fish, when sated in the depths, meet with disaster.\n\nI shall now clear the overgrowth of the Nine Classics and sow the fine seeds of the Six Virtues. Though my fields lie far from the highest grade of soil, will not their harvest be abundant? Why must one toil at plowing and sowing between heaven and earth?\n\nOf old, Xu You discarded his wealth to halt theft; the Yu family shattered their jade to curb greed. Shu Guang scattered his gold to spare his descendants from disaster; Sun Ao chose poverty to dispel the anxieties of desire. Niu Que, laden with treasures, invited bandits; Tao Kan, with his hoarded wealth, summoned misfortune. The contrast between gain and loss is clear—can one afford not to take heed?”\n\nAt this, the questioner fell silent for a long while, his mouth agape yet unable to speak, his head bowed yet unable to lift it. He sighed deeply and said: “At first, I sought to establish words of immortality, not to be drowned in the pursuit of property. I chased the achievements of the lowered curtain, not to let my gaze wander to the garden. You, sir, with your fondness for the tender chick and your schemes for pheasant and crab—do you not find this base? How vulgar! That you did not know this sooner!”\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: Embracing Poverty**\n\nThe *Baopuzi* said:\n\nIn the late Han, the flame of the dynasty dimmed, dragons warred and tigers contended, the Nine Lands split asunder, and the Three Families seized the tripods. There was a man called Master Le Tian who fled turmoil, drifting from place to place, wandering through Min and Yi. At first, he dwelt in intimacy with Wen Xiu, yet remained unknown to Kongming. His words were lofty, his conduct square, standing alone and apart from the crowd. The people of his time held him in awe, and none dared approach him. Though the power of the two lords of the age could not be defied, they allowed this scholar to languish in obscurity. His teeth aged like the mulberry and elm, yet he did not alter his coarse cloth. The ruler of the time longed for worthy men, but those in power neither recommended nor promoted him. He hid in the humble lanes of Wu, concealed in a thatched hut by the pivot of the gate. He forsook the affairs of governing the world and neglected the business of sustaining life. His meals of wild greens were often empty; he did not plan for the evening by morning.\n\nThereupon, a young man of conventional society visited and questioned him, saying: “I have heard that one with the talent of Yi or Lü does not long remain mired in poverty and lowliness, nor does one possessing the methods of Yi Dun endure hunger and cold for long. The wise value knowing when to change; the intelligent test their worth by not clinging to the past. When Fan Li emerged, he aided Wu and saved Yue, becoming a counselor for the age; when he withdrew, he engaged in trade and amassed wealth of ten thousand gold. Poverty is among the six misfortunes; wealth is among the five blessings. The *Book of Songs* praises the fortunate; the *Book of Changes* values gathering people. Cast fragrant bait, and sturgeon and salmon come; offer a rich reward, and the resolute are roused. Sima Xiangru shed his apron and held the vermilion tassel; Chen Ping left his humble door and enjoyed the fief of Maotu. Lü Buwei was thus fed by a domain of ten thousand households; the Marquis of Jiang was thus delivered from prison’s confinement. Thus, the lowly minister’s frugality brought regret and disgrace, while the drifting old woman’s generosity earned a thousand gold in return.\n\nYou, sir, possess no extraordinary strategies like Xiao Bo, yet you focus your keen thoughts solely on the Six Classics. You ignore the real disaster of starvation, yearning instead for the empty fame of immortality. You are ashamed to seek office through devious means, disdain to peddle your talents for glory, hope for the stratagems of King Wen, and await the clearing of the Yellow River. You willingly endure the emaciation of Liezi, aspire to preserve your spirit while neglecting your conduct—how is this different from painting a fine steed to replace the toil of walking, or pointing to the sea to quench a parched mouth? Casting a fishing net upon a towering peak or dangling a hook from the tip of a tall tree, though you may deem it right, is this not still impractical and absurd?\n\nNow, within the seas, the realm is divided, heroes vie in strength, and the cunning of the age are exiled like Xia. The swift and the slow race along the same path; jackals and wolves bare their fangs in mutual strife. Those in power cast nets to ensnare the upright; scholars of purity are trampled underfoot on the path. Pure scholars abandon the Dao of emperors to practice the arts of the Five Hegemons; great minds forsake the Four Disciplines to heed the monthly critiques. Those with full baskets advance from the wilds; those lacking resources retreat from the court. Those who grasp alchemy push through the golden gates to ascend the jade halls; those who recite esoteric texts make lifelong enemies and sink into the mire. Those with lavish gifts turn tiles and stones into jade; those with meager offerings discard dragons and fine steeds like weeds. Those with many allies soar with the whirlwind; those with few companions swim with the lame turtle. A pellet of mud cannot dam the boiling of Pengli, yet how can a lone worthy reverse the current and avoid the error of fleeing the world?\n\nNow, sir, you have no store of grain at home, no bundle of dried meat to offer abroad. You merely harbor hidden brilliance like the phoenix, conceal patterns like the tiger and leopard, speak like the surging waves, and array your words like brocade. Yet you freeze and starve within crumbling walls—what plan do you have to avoid pity? Why not launch a light boat to seek patronage, ride swift sails to distant lands? Trade rare goods in the north and south, gather gold and jade from Jiuyi, follow the distant footsteps of Jiao Lie, and secure fine office in this clear age. Instead, you exhaust yourself in writing—is there any end to this molting like the cicada? You merely wear yourself out for fame, which even the Yellow Emperor and Laozi would scorn.”\n\nMaster Le Tian replied: “When the Six Arts are thoroughly studied and the Eight Compilations fully mastered, this is wealth. When brushes are wielded to compose, and virtuous words are inexhaustible, this is nobility. Seek benevolence, and benevolence arrives—what more is there to desire?”\n\nAs for dwelling deep in the abyss to nurture the numinous, dismissing the myriad things to find contentment, casting worldly dust from perilous paths, and clarifying the spirit in profound silence—never gazing through windows for distant vistas, discerning right from wrong without confusion—even if you set before me tripods and thrones, I would not alter my resolve. How could I then fret over poverty and vie with merchants for profit, or grieve over hardship and compete with the vulgar for success?\n\nIf you know that trading can amass treasures and tilling can stave off hunger, you must also recognize that the deer-chaser heeds not the hounds, and the distant traveler arrives not late. Moreover, Lü Shang, though but a knife-wielding butcher, later revealed his brilliance. A weight of ten thousand *jun* may be heavy, yet a whirlwind cannot shift it; the *Xiaoshao* melody may not reach its ninth movement, yet the sacred birds do not bow in ceremony. Thus, those who await the ascending winds to soar into the azure skies do not crouch in the tips of mugwort and wormwood; those who gallop with reins of orchid to scale the six directions do not contend for paths with the crowd.\n\nThe herd of lame donkeys fears the perils of filial devotion, so Zichun trembled at the thought of his father’s fall. The supremely wise do not prize hard-won talents, so Yao and Shun discarded gold and cast aside jade. The enlightened avert disaster before it arises; the wise, hearing of profit, weigh its harm. Yet you urge me to launch a boat, diligently seeking wealth within gilded halls—encouraging me to sling a Sui pearl to shoot a sparrow, or snatch meat from a tiger’s jaws. You would have me risk my body in the unpredictable, brave grave dangers for distant gains, forgetting the clear warnings of flesh and hair, chasing ruin in peril, hoping for fortune in calamity.\n\nThen there are those who overturn chariots on flaming wheels, topple trees from cliffs, split rocks with flying stones, or stand where mountain peaks loom over surging waves—light boats drift like dust, strength fails the will, and all they can do is weep without achievement, only then awakening to the foresight of the wise.\n\nOf old, Yan Hui was praised for his purity amid hardship; Chen Ping escaped peril by having no gold; Guanghan perished for his love of profit; Niu Que was reduced to ashes for carrying treasure. A common man dies in vain for clinging to jade; Feng Hu summoned disaster with fine furs. Now you would have me wield the craft of teaching thieves, urge me toward the path of inviting bandits, and proffer poisoned wine in toasts—this is no way to nurture life.\n\nRather, the scholar treats the *Three Rites* as gold and jade, the *Five Canons* as zither and zheng, discourse and study as bells and drums, and the Hundred Schools as reed pipes and flutes. Let those who savor the Dao be sated by its words, and those who intoxicate themselves with virtue be awakened by its principles. Rise above the common stream, tread loftily, surpass the ages, and let your name resound. Gallop alone on the long path—what need have you for the filth of wealth?\n\nFor those who hoard much lose abundance; those who favor modesty are envied for their fullness. Concealing a night-shining pearl invites swift destruction; following the tracks of an overturned cart ensures a fall. Overloading a boat sinks it; seeking victory destroys life. These are the concerns of lesser men, not the pursuits of those who embody the highest virtue.\n\nThereupon, the questioner stood in bewildered silence, lost in thought, and begged to be enrolled as the least of the disciples, forever treasuring the true formula for long life.\n\n*Renming*, Chapter Thirty-Seven\n\nBao Puzi said: The disciples together debated the precedence of *ren* and *ming*, each presenting their views, and so they consulted me. I told them:\n\nThe Three Luminaries suspend their images—this is *qian*. The earth bears all without end—this is *kun*. *Qian* possesses *ren* and also *ming*; *kun* possesses *ren* but lacks *ming*. Is not the distinction between high and low thus vast?\n\nOnly the sage aligns his virtue with Heaven. Thus, Tang Yao crowned his canons with \"reverence and clarity,\" while Confucius placed \"illuminating *yi*\" at the head of his chapters. \"Illuminating, illuminating on high\"—this is the title of the sovereign. \"The perspicacious preserve themselves\"—this is the lost trace of the *Greater Odes*.\n\nEven the flying midge and creeping worm possess *ren*, for their intent to cherish and nurture is evident, and their sorrow at chirping distress is manifest. Yet they rush into pits and wells without suspicion, enter snares without awareness—possessing *ren* but lacking *ming*, they hasten together toward calamity.\n\nHad it not been for the blazing brilliance of the hidden sun, jade tablets and capped pillars would have been exchanged for woven mats; had it not been for the framing of halls and roofs, nests and burrows would not have been abandoned. The selection of grains to eliminate poison, the fashioning of garments to replace nakedness, the harnessing of boats and oars to cross impassable waters, the yoking of oxen and horses to rest from bearing burdens, the ordering of ranks and dignities to quell disorder, the forging of tools and weapons to guard against unforeseen threats, the creation of writing to govern the hundred officials, the establishment of rites and laws to refine customs—all these are the works of great *ming*, not the distinctions that partial men can discern.\n\nIf the heart does not depart from *ren* yet *ming* does not govern the state, how can the disasters of peril and ruin be averted? This much is clear.\n\nTo gauge prosperity and decline before their signs appear, to probe the subtle workings of affairs before their forms take shape, to point out hidden dangers beyond the surface of principle, to resist insidious influences at their root—this is the achievement of *ming*.\n\nTo extend compassion to all creatures, though wronged yet not retaliating, to alter the sacrificial victim upon seeing its trembling, to avoid trampling the tender reeds—this is the function of *ren*.\n\nOtherwise, *ming* is but talent, and *ren* is but conduct.\n\nThe act of sacrificing oneself to perfect others may be striven for and attained, yet the clarity that fathoms the profound and probes the obscure cannot be falsely assumed. The distinction between refinement and coarseness stands starkly evident.\n\nIf one embodies the *ren* that cannot bear suffering yet lacks the *ming* that discerns right from wrong, the heart becomes confounded by truth and falsehood, the spirit disordered by crimson and violet, unable to distinguish grades or recognize good and evil. Failing even to secure one’s own safety, how can one establish a foundation to aid others?\n\nOf old, the Duke of Zhou was not without fraternal love, yet he wept to restrain his kin; Shi Que was not without natural tenderness, yet he severed private ties to serve the public. For they clearly perceived the nature of affairs, did not drown in proximate sentiments, and thus became pure ministers, cutting off affection for the sake of benefit, curbing *ren* with *ming* to temper its use. *Ren* may be temporarily set aside, but *ming* cannot be absent.\n\nThe mandate of Heaven was revolutionized by its *ming*.\nXu Yan cultivated *ren* to unify the court, yet his domain cast aside the peril of moats and walls, and within, there were no shields or spears in readiness—ruin and destruction befell his state and house, a calamity born of *ming*’s absence.\n\nThe disciples said: Confucius sighed that *ming* and *ren* are burdens heavy and the Way distant. He also said: \"If a man lacks *ren*, what can ritual mean to him?\" And again: \"If I claim sageliness and *ren*, how dare I?\" Mencius said: \"*Ren* is the dwelling; *yi* is the path.\" A man without a heart of compassion is not *ren*. The Three Dynasties gained the world through *ren* and lost it through its absence—these are the maxims of sages and worthies, the manifest proofs of bamboo and silk.\n\nYet you, sir, exalt *ming* without citing canonical evidence. I, a benighted student, remain perplexed.\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity replied: The ancients said, \"To love *ren* but not study is to be led into folly.\" You come close to this, my young friend. Once, the six states devoured one another, wolves and tigers vied in strength, cunning and deceit prevailed below, while virtue and morality were abandoned, and killing and aggression displaced yielding and deference. Mencius arose, seeking to suppress the rapacious and brutal, to exalt and elevate *ren* and *yi*—how could he not earnestly and repeatedly extol *ren* alone? Yet never did he utter a single word that *ren* surpasses *ming*.\n\nIt is like a time of plague, when physicians and shamans are prized, and all speak with one voice of medicines and stones—could one then claim that the art of acupuncture and moxibustion surpasses the Way of long life and enduring vision?\n\nMoreover, I hold that the matters of *ren* and *ming* are spread across the four directions, aiming only to cut to the essence and illustrate the broad outlines, to grasp the spirit and point to one corner. Yet you still say, \"In daily use yet unknown,\" and claim that *ming* lacks evidence—how so?\n\nQian declares, \"Great brightness begins and ends, completing the six positions in their seasons\"—this establishes Heaven to show that nothing is not encompassed. Kun states, \"Utmost yielding, the myriad things rely on it for birth\"—this is the virtue of Earth, which with *ren* bears and follows alone. Is not the principle of precedence and succession thus luminously clear?\n\nThe *Odes* says:\n*\"Bright, bright is the Highest Heaven,*\n*Illumining the lands below.*\n*Bright, bright is the Son of Heaven,*\n*His illustrious fame unceasing.\"*\n\nThe *Changes* states: *\"The king faces south toward brightness and receives its blessing.\"* The *Appended Judgments* say: *\"Obscurely assisting the numinous brightness, numinously brightening it.\"* Here, brightness and the numinous form a single body—how could pure *ren* alone presume to reach it?\n\nConfucius said: *\"Keen of hearing, bright of vision, divine in martiality,\"*—he did not say *\"keen of ren.\"* Again he said: *\"Of old, the bright kings governed all under Heaven,\"*—he did not say *\"ren kings.\"* The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: *\"Bright virtue is most fragrant,\"*—it does not say *\"ren virtue.\"* The *Documents* says: *\"The sovereign’s head is bright indeed!\"*—it does not say *\"ren indeed!\"*\n\nLaozi sighs: of the highest scholar, he says *\"bright-eyed, seeing in all four directions,\"*—while of the declining and meager, he says *\"losing the Dao, then virtue; losing virtue, then ren.\"* The *Changes* states: *\"The king faces south toward brightness,\"*—it does not say *\"toward ren.\"*\n\n*\"If I desire ren, ren comes.\"* And again: *\"To practice ren lies with oneself.\"* Thus, *ren* is something everyone can achieve. But how can one command brightness and keen perception? Hence Mencius says: *\"Whenever people see a child about to fall into a well, none fail to rush forward to save it.\"* From this we see that none lack the heart of *ren*—only in its depth or shallowness does the distinction lie, while the division of brightness and perception arises in due time.\n\nOf old, Cui Zhu did not kill Yan Ying. Though Zhu was greatly un-*ren*, he yet possessed a small *ren*. Thus even treacherous ministers and murderous sons may still have *ren*.\n\nA disciple further says: *\"The *Changes* speaks of establishing the human Dao as *ren* and *yi*—thus nothing in humanity surpasses *ren*.\"*\n\nBaopuzi replies: *\"The reason I speak thus is that *ren* lies in action—action can be established, and brightness, joined with the numinous, must be a talent bestowed by Heaven. It is not what can be taught to all.\"*\n\n**Extensive Analogies, Thirty-Eight**\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"A weight of ten thousand jun must begin with a zhu; towering heights that pierce the clouds must begin with a hair’s breadth. Thus trickling streams gather to form the Southern Sea, and span upon span accumulates to reach the boundless expanse. The commonplace piles up to attain the gardens of the immortals, and the utmost heights of Heaven.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Those who gallop swiftly may leave their shadows behind yet not grow weary; those who ride the wind and cleave the waves may cross peril yet not capsize. Thus the great ministers divided their duties, and the achievements of emulating Heaven were accomplished; Yi and Lü were entrusted, and the merit of revolution was achieved.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Jade boats and coral oars are of no use in crossing rivers; golden bows and jade arrows cannot propel a shot. Thus those who are incorruptible yet lack governance are not instruments for quelling disorder; those who are refined and elegant yet lack administrative strategy are not talents for assisting a ruler.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The towering heights of Langfeng and the immortal gardens do not borrow elevation from a mound; the luminous *xuan* and *jielü* jades do not seek display from common stones. Thus the heroic and peerless exude the fragrance of hidden orchids, startling all with their lofty bearing; the resolute and independent evoke the cries of myriad birds, their voices resounding.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Ice and charcoal do not boast of their cold and heat; fine jades do not prove their worth by their luster. Thus the noble person, reverent in self-cultivation, does not fret over being unknown; the perfected person, dwelling in stillness, leaves behind praise and blame.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"A whirlwind may topple mountains yet cannot exert force on an autumn hair; fire may melt metal and stone yet cannot cast its glow upon a tiny stream. Thus Han Xin excelled in warfare yet was clumsy in the strategies of governance; the Marquis of Xiang kept the altars secure yet lacked ready eloquence in response.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Those who pursue fame do not find risking their lives difficult; those who value themselves do not let near desires burden their hearts. Thus Ji Xin gladly turned to ashes without regret; Yang Zhu equated a single hair with a city of linked jade.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The minnow does not comprehend the distant journey of the divine dragon; the teal and duck know not the mismatch of the swan and crane. Thus those who plow in pairs mock Chen Sheng for casting aside his plow; the shallow-minded ridicule Kongming for clasping his knees.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The edge of a pure blade is tested against rhinoceros and buffalo; the excellence of proclaimed kindness is proven through clear trial. Thus when alike in office, the great ministers and petty officials are no different; when employed together, the swiftest steed and the slowest nag are indistinguishable.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"A vessel not of *hu* or *gui* must advance the sharp and retreat the dull. Though one’s measure be modeled on Yi and Lü, late in starting, one may yet arrive early. Thus the wren, weary of flight, does not surpass the tip of a thistle; the young phoenix, rising slowly, gazes about and cries to the azure vastness.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Nine times severed, four times joined—the *wenzao* and *zao* plants thus display their numinosity. Branches broken, leaves crushed—the *chai* and *hui* herbs thus increase their fragrance. Thus Yi Wu, though shackled, built the achievements of rectifying the realm; the Marquis of Ying, though humiliated, left his meritorious deeds in Qin.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"When what is contended over is trivial, interests align and enmity forms; when good and ill take different paths, affairs diverge and knots arise. Thus the ugly Momu and the hunchbacked woman despised seeing Xi Shi’s lovely face; the young Shang Chen and Xiaobai resented hearing of Yan Zhou’s retired plowing.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"When acuity and dullness diverge in their tracks, those who lag behind feel shame and regret; when strength and weakness differ in their categories, those who lift tripods are envied. Thus Han Xin was promoted to prominence, and the mediocre grew sullen and resentful, hastening his downfall; Wu’an’s achievements were lofty, and Fan Sui adorned his words to ruin his affairs.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"A fatal illness will not reject bitter medicine; rotting wood will not accept carving and ornament. Thus Bi Gan, though not self-serving, had his heart cut out for his utter loyalty; Tian Feng, though farsighted, was executed for his forthright words.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The solitary tong tree of Yiyang cannot, without a pillar, produce its mournful tones; the solitary bamboo of Great Xia cannot, without being blown, emit its clear notes. Thus when office is lowly, even Hou Ji and Xie cannot bring peace to the common weal; when authority is meager, even Yi and Zhou cannot attain the heights of governance.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Those who climb heights are cautioned against the perils of the summit; those who cross deep waters meet disaster when their boats are overloaded. Thus in the west, Qin had Li Si, who rued his rise from Shangcai; in the east, Yue had Wen Zhong, who regretted his fullness of opportunity.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Hard and soft possess unchanging natures; integrity and flexibility have their inherent qualities. Thus a hundred smeltings do not diminish the true essence of southern gold; peril and hardship do not make the resolute man lose his rectitude.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Without following the Dao, wealth and nobility are not worth dwelling in; forsaking *ren* and abandoning *yi*, even long life to a hundred years is not worth begrudging. Thus Bian Sui cast himself into the river with a stone; Zhong You willingly went to the blade.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"High and low cannot be leveled as one; fine grain and coarse fodder cannot encourage or discourage alike. Thus Hui Shi fretted over the glory of a thousand chariots; Zhuang Zhou worried over the abundance of ways to catch fish.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Withdrawal and engagement differ as ice and charcoal; impatience and calm diverge as flight and sinking. Thus Mo Di found joy in thick calluses; the northern elder found contentment in leaving the world behind.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"One who suits the heart finds shallow acquaintance yet deep affection; one who offends the spirit finds long association yet sudden estrangement. Thus, those of like voice tip their carriage canopies as if old friends; those of differing ways may share a lifetime yet feel no love.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The grand ship with kingfisher prow is a fine vessel for crossing rivers, yet steered by a northern barbarian, it founders in the waves. The swift steed of *puchao* and *hanxue* is a fleet-footed courser, yet driven by one not a Zaofu, it stumbles on perilous paths. The sharp blades of Qingping and Haocao are peerless in keenness, yet wielded by one not of Yu or Yue, they bring self-injury. The keen troops and crack soldiers are divine instruments for quelling chaos, yet employed by one not wise and sagely, they hasten the disaster of self-immolation.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Heaven’s order has its unchanging constancy; to violate reverence without ritual is to court swift death as with a sharp blade. Thus, the birds and beasts of the sacred isles, though they may speak, are not admitted among the noble sacrificial beasts; the ants and beetles, though they bear life, are not deemed capable of *ren* and *yi*.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Slander cannot be dispelled by clever words, nor can deep resentment be dissolved by empty deeds. To quell strife not by the Dao or resolve it not by principle is like embracing ice to dispel cold, hefting a heavy furnace to repel heat, chasing light to escape shadow, or boring a boat to quench thirst.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"A wise ruler appoints men to office without exceeding their capacity; a loyal minister occupies his position without overstepping his measure. To grant office beyond one’s talent or burden with tasks beyond one’s strength is like filling an ice bowl with boiling water, wrapping a blazing fire in reed sheaths, fastening a ten-thousand-*jun* weight to a rotten rope, or loading a double burden onto a fragile skiff.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The fur of leopard and fox is not for the woodcutter; the nine movements and six transformations of music are not for the deaf. To raise one’s voice in distant harmony is not for the common fool; to speak boldly and act resolutely is not for the man of meager virtue. To compose the *Baopuzi*—\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"When the people’s wealth is exhausted yet demands do not cease, when their strength is spent yet labor does not pause, to hope that resentment will not arise and long for lasting peace is like severing roots to graft branches, cutting flesh from the back to patch the thigh, gouging out eyes to broaden sight, or slicing off ears to sharpen hearing.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Laws have no fixed form yet one admires their timely adaptability; achievements do not surpass the past yet one delights in frequent change to suit the俗. This is like trimming a tall horse to fit a low carriage, shaving the ankles to fit tight shoes, breaking a long sword to fit a short scabbard, or cutting a foot-wide jade disk to fit a narrow box.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The great fish with long scales does not emerge from narrow valleys; the lofty trees where phoenixes perch do not flourish on low mounds. The profound maxims of the Nine Categories are not uttered by the mouths of the common and base; the exalted teachings of the Golden Tablets do not arise from the bosoms of ordinary folk. Seeing a branch a hundred arm-spans wide, one knows its root is not slender; beholding the vast and deep patterns of a man, one perceives his depth and breadth.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The mulberry groves and dense forests have no cypress or pine to chill the air; the fertile fields near the city walls have no famine relief to dispel hunger. Yet from these come silken cocoons and fine fabrics, filling a thousand granaries and ten thousand storehouses. Thus, those who see far value the root; those who see near pursue the branch.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"One who grasps the coarse is bound to form; one who knows the refined attains the spirit. One who traces beginnings and sees endings has a thread of inference; one who grasps things before their signs appear has no need to borrow from external causes. Thus, to see heaven and earth by day is not deemed keen; to discern the finest hair at night is called peerless.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The fragrant blossoms of spring cannot long leave their branches; the great fish that swallow boats do not abandon the deep waters to preserve their lives. Thus, one whose name is fair yet whose substance does not match will lack enduring reputation; one whose rank is high yet whose capacity does not suffice will not escape the downfall of inviting bandits.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"To endure the bitter medicine and piercing stone is to remove life-threatening illness; to don the heavy chill of armor is to ward off the rain of arrows. To embrace the constraints of pure conduct is to preserve the integrity of one’s work; to accept the most heart-chafing admonitions is to avoid the confusion of changing course.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"When phoenixes and simurghs vie for grain in the courtyard, they are loved no more than chickens and ducks; when dragon scales are mixed among the fodder of common beasts, they are defiled among the six sacrificial animals. Thus, the elder of Shang perched on the heights to spread his lofty and distant conduct; Bian Sui plunged into the depths to preserve his reputation of leaving the world behind.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"A deep well not dredged grows muddy and foul; fine grain not weeded becomes choked with tares. To study without reflection is to be beset by doubts; to lecture without precision is to prolong confusion and waste effort.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"To hoard ten thousand gold in chests and coffers, though one be frugal and never use it, is no different from poverty. To harbor refined thoughts in the heart yet never commit them to brush and silk is no different from the common and base.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Nan Wei and Qing Qin, paragons of beauty, must still await splendid adornment to enhance their loveliness; Yan Hui and Zi Xia, though gifted with genius and brilliance, truly required the classics to broaden their wisdom.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Red curtains and woven nets, layered and doubled, obscure even the fairest form; vermilion lacquer and intricate decoration, dazzling and bright, conceal even the gnarled wood. Thus, when the Six Arts are mastered, the base are transformed into gentlemen; when praise is widespread, the rustic are drawn near to the noble.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"In dense forests and tangled thickets, the feathered tribes gather like clouds; in deep and boundless waters, the scaled multitudes vie to arrive. Where virtue and work are vast, those who lodge their hearts are many; where flaws are noted and use is distant, those who draw near are few.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"To seek the fleetest of flying and swiftest of running creatures yet be unable to gallop freely on the Lü Liang rapids, to command creatures that tread waves and swim the depths yet be unable to scale heights and climb perilous peaks—thus, Li Zhu could split an autumn hair at a hundred paces yet could not distinguish the eight tones’ refinement; Zi Ye could harmonize the rarest of numinous sounds yet could not point out black and white at a foot’s distance.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"When the four faculties of hearing are widely opened, even Xihe receives the light of myriad fathoms; when the self is emptied, even the trickling streams gather. Thus, the way of broad inquiry is revered, and rare knowledge fills the court; the brilliance of the beacon tower shines, and extraordinary men knock at the gate. The tree for slander is set up, and faults are surely known; the drum for forthright admonition is hung, and straight words are surely offered.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"No one fails to praise the governance of Yao, yet not all of it was necessarily good; no one fails to condemn the rule of Jie, yet not all of it was necessarily bad. Thus, a single withered branch does not diminish the lushness of the forest; winter wheat does not undo the autumn’s severity. Xi Shi had her flaws, yet they could not lessen her beauty, for her beauty was abundant; Mo Mu had her virtues, yet they could not redeem her ugliness, for her ugliness was profound.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Body and reputation are difficult to advance together; merit and spirit are seldom preserved in full. Those whose virtue is fragmented suffer hardship yet find stability; those who use it to navigate the world enjoy ease yet face many dangers. Thus, birds of prey are trapped by their own fierce strikes; birds of eloquence are caged by their own cleverness. Jade is cut for its patterns; the three metals are smelted for their splendor. Orchids and iris are burned for their fragrance; catalpa and nanmu are hewn for their resonance. For this reason, the azure dragon, seeing Boyi, ascends to the dark clouds; the divine bird, encountering Mengxi, returns to the cinnabar cave. Ziyong forever sighs at the greatness of the heavenly bond; Zhuangzi mourns the sacrifice of the patterned ox.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"A thousand elk turn their antlers, and even fierce tigers must sheathe their fangs; a thousand birds gather in flocks, and birds of prey must clench their talons. Thus, when slander spreads through the four lands, even the Duke of Zhou cannot suppress it; when critics fill the roads, even Zichan has no way to silence them.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The beauty of Wei Shi cannot be surpassed by powder and rouge; the qi of the solstices cannot be augmented by breath. Therefore, those who harbor the measure of hidden excellence do not flaunt their bearing to display distinction; those who embody the vessel of transcendent rarity do not trouble themselves with petty praise to seek commonality.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The qilin halts at the phoenix’s perch—what it fears is scarcity; the fox howls and the owl shrieks—what the world loathes is their abundance. Thus, when men of talent fill the court, those who seek worthies never tire; when slanderers wield power, the loyal and steadfast gnash their teeth.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Great strength is not limited to Meng Ben and Wu Huo; graceful beauty is not confined to Zheng Dan and Mao Qiang. Swiftness is not the sole domain of Hua Liu and Su Shuang; decisive judgment is not the monopoly of Zhan Lu and Gan Jiang. Therefore, those who establish the enterprise of the Uncrowned King need not be the Qiu of Eastern Lu; those who practice the benevolence of healing withered bones need not be the Chang of the Western Neighborhood.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The divine bird’s cry resounds in the morning sun—though it brings no benefit to creatures, none below fail to listen with rapt attention. The owl gathers at night on the eaves—though it causes not a hair’s harm, none fail to cover their ears and cast blame. Thus, good words travel far without fail to please; evil speech arrives near without fail to offend—like the sun and moon, whose steadfast brightness admits no decline, or the crooked arrow, which is despised the moment it appears.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Shadows do not deviate from their forms; names do not stray from their realities. Thus, water without a source cannot stem the long flow that spreads eastward; untimely blossoms cannot endure the radiance of frost and ice.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Beasts with saw-like fangs, though crouching low, are still feared; insects that wield axes, though hiding their form, still command awe. The noble man, though impoverished, cannot be slighted; the petty man, though exalted, is not to be esteemed.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The qilin roams beyond the great wilderness, thus avoiding the disaster of traps and snares. The divine bird soars above the peaks of the Dark Garden, thus escaping the peril of nets and snares. Why must one dwell in crooked caves to harbor eternal fear? Why must one clutch reeds in the beak to wear a mournful guise? Therefore, those destined for the butcher’s block must love the fodder of the pen; those fated for the boiling pot must find comfort in standing in the courtyard.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The wise value discerning the echoes of governance from a thousand years past to uncover the traces of rise and fall. The discerning treasure spotting phoenixes among the frostbitten to extract those who can save the age. Yet to heed the clamor of the many and seek counsel from the mediocre is not the clear hearing of Yan Zhou; to bend the talents of the distant worthy and consult the common man is not the extraordinary insight of the uniquely perceptive. Thus, to discuss the use of towering vessels with those who do not prize things is like having the blind point out the five colors; to plot the promotion of the fiercely upright with those who envy their betters is like entrusting the fox to mend the fur coat.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The roc and the *luan* bird suffer peril on the steepest cliffs, unwilling to endure the drudgery of captivity. The *jiguang* hungers and thirsts in the frozen wilds, unwilling to accept the fullness of sacrifice. The men of Guzhu did not trade their fasting for the riches of the Deer Terrace; Zifang did not barter his poverty for the abundance of the Copper Mountain.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Those whose aspirations align do not regard mountains and seas as distant; those whose paths diverge do not see a foot’s span as near. Thus, some cross vast distances to gather together, while others remain close yet never meet.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The splendor of embroidered robes is not the work of a single dye; the towering majesty of Mount Song is not the accumulation of a single basket. Thus, when the Nine Ministers were employed, the achievements of King Kang flourished; when the Four Lords were entrusted, the meritorious deeds of the royal aides shone forth.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The azure dragon soars to the heavens without wings; the flying snake darts like lightning without feet. The turtle hears well without ears; the earthworm projects its voice without a mouth. Thus, Gaoyao, though mute, matched the eloquent in merit; the blind man of Jin, though sightless, equaled Li Zhu in clarity.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Those in high office do not necessarily match their positions in talent; those with fair reputations do not necessarily live up to their names. Thus, saw teeth cannot chew; the tongue of a winnowing basket cannot distinguish flavors. The ear of a pot cannot discern sound; the nose of a sword cannot detect qi. The eye of a cauldron cannot capture the moonlight; the legs of a bed cannot chase the flight of a galloping horse.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The common traveler cannot draw the powerful bow of Yang You and hit the mark; Yanzi cannot grasp the reins and know of Dongye’s defeat. Thus, there are those who cannot lay the foundation yet recognize black and white at a glance; who cannot strum the zither yet understand the refined and the vulgar when they hear them.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The water that irrigates ten thousand acres must flow from the highest peaks; the flood that crests the heavens must arise from the tiniest trickle. Thus, world-shaking merit must come from a vessel of unparalleled excellence; the strategy to steady a tottering state must spring from a mind that transcends the common. Therefore, the nest of the tiny midge has no feathers to ride the wind; the ditches and streams hold no luminous jades of the night.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The whirlwind fans the prairie fire, causing it to burn brighter, yet when fireflies and candles encounter it, they are extinguished. Sweet rain and nourishing dew cause flourishing life to thrive, yet when withered trees receive them, they hasten to rot. The vermilion wheel and ornate hub are the great treasures of the talented, yet when borne by the unworthy, they invite disaster. The cauldron of ten thousand measures and the bell of a thousand *zhong* are the proper rewards for meritorious service, yet when bestowed upon the mediocre, they lead to ruin.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Rhinoceros hide is made into armor for the exclusive use of the commander; kingfisher plumes are gathered into ornaments for the empress’s headdress. Though they leave the deep valley for the towering tree, in the reckoning of these two creatures, it is better to hide in the thickets and preserve life in the brambles. Thus, the divine turtle would rather drag its tail through the mud than be treasured in a silk-lined box; the marsh pheasant delights in pecking ten steps away to avoid the disaster of chickens and ducks.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: Partial talent is insufficient to govern the whole; narrow excellence cannot remedy the many shortcomings. Thus, the rooster knows the approach of dawn yet cannot fathom the reckonings of yin and yang; the crane recognizes midnight yet cannot grasp the principles of gnomon shadows. The mountain turtledove foresees fair weather and rain yet cannot comprehend astronomy; the snake and ant know the dwelling places of hidden waters yet cannot fathom geography.\n\nBaopuzi says: When prohibitions are unclear and harsh punishments are imposed to quell disorder, when ancestral temple divinations are imprecise and troops are exhausted to invade neighbors—this is like cutting grain to count locusts, felling trees to kill borers, consuming poison to strike fleas and lice, or removing the roof to chase sparrows and rats.\n\nBaopuzi says: Sharp blades emerge from dull stones; bright fires blaze from dark wood. Precious pearls arise from lowly clams; fine jade is hewn from ugly ore. Thus, one cannot measure the weight of Shun by his parents, nor gauge the merit of Wei and Huo by their ancestors.\n\nBaopuzi says: When aspirations are fulfilled, the countenance is joyful; when intentions are thwarted, the face is downcast. When the root withers, the branches dry; when the source is shallow, the stream runs dry. What lies within must manifest without; what arises near must be evident afar.\n\nBaopuzi says: Lovely forms and charming appearances differ in shape and hue, yet the delight they bring may be equal. Strings and bamboo, metal and stone—though their tones vary—equally please the ear. Casting arrows or sinking hooks, raising nets or lowering traps—though their methods differ—yield the same success. Establishing merit, composing words, or choosing one’s path—though their routes diverge—share a single noble aim.\n\nBaopuzi says: Abundant profit harbors the source of harm; exquisite beauty invites disaster. Thus, southern birds are slaughtered for their patterned feathers; cave leopards die for their striped pelts. Sturgeon and carp accumulate, and the deep pools run dry; deer and elk gather, and the lush forests burn. Gold and jade are prized, and bandits arrive; fame and rank rise, and worries and vexations follow.\n\nBaopuzi says: When autumn winds blow and the skies grow crisp, fine fans are set aside. When climbing perilous heights, light boats are abandoned. When weapons and war clouds arise, scholars retreat; when mourning and chaos are settled, warriors are dismissed.\n\nBaopuzi says: What is valued at ten thousand gold need not be seen to distinguish its worth; what has branches as thick as an embrace need not be measured to know its size. Thus, gazing at the vast embankment of a flood, one knows it will not rise from a puddle; observing the boundless expanse of a literary masterpiece, one knows it did not come from a pedant.\n\nBaopuzi says: Red blossoms and green grasses do not cling to crooked, withered stems; purple mushrooms and fragrant weeds do not grow in barren, salty soil. Thus, those who receive the jade tablet to announce success emerge from the gates of the four condemned; those who inherit the mandate from the cultured ancestors arise from the households of the stubborn and perverse.\n\nBaopuzi says: Good words in a dwelling resonate without limit; crooked or straight, if untrue, find no response near or far. Thus, in the wilds of Song, the planet Mars retreated; in the Yin court, close kin fled. White jade rings came from beyond the borders of Shaoguang; deer and horses transformed within the palace walls.\n\nBaopuzi says: Jing Ke and Zhu Hai did not display their courage at the gates of the timid; Meng Ben and Feng Fu did not brandish their weapons among rustic warriors. Eminent scholars and great minds do not refine petty arguments among the shallow; enlightened and noble men do not alter their brilliance amid the vulgar.\n\nBaopuzi says: Bowing and yielding are not the demeanor for repelling invaders; armor and helmets are not the adornments of the ancestral hall. Sashes and pendants cannot be used to wield blades in battle; measured steps and regulated strides cannot save from fire or drowning.\n\nBaopuzi says: Heaven and Earth nurture the myriad things, yet they do not recognize its grace—for its benefits are boundless. The great person transforms through spirit, yet the masses do not perceive its influence—for it governs what has not yet arisen. Thus, what is easily known is small; what is readily predicted is few.\n\nBaopuzi says: E Huang and Ren Si were not praised foremost for sericulture; Tang, Wu, and Han Gaozu were not lauded for trivial conduct. Those who gaze clearly at the three luminaries have no leisure to bend over well pools; those who purify their hearing with the *Shao* and *Hu* have no time to lend their ears to the mulberry groves.\n\nBaopuzi says: Appearances cannot always reveal the inner truth; reputation cannot always measure ability. Confucius resembled a stray dog; the Duke of Zhou was like rough-hewn timber. Gao Yao’s face was like a demon’s; Yi Yin’s form was like a withered skeleton. Yet Longyang and Song Chao were like clay figurines crowned with earth; the luminous pearl borrowed from Ru, Dong, and Deng was like brocade wrapping dust.\n\nBaopuzi says: Yao and Shun could not transform the utterly foolish, so their teachings failed among their own descendants. Jie and Zhou could not corrupt the supremely wise, so their evil did not taint the Three Sages.\n\nBaopuzi says: The greatest has limits to its power; the smallest has what cannot be taken. Thus, frost and killing cold cannot wither the lushness of beans and wheat; sweltering heat and oppressive humidity cannot melt the snows of the mountains. Whirlwinds churn the sea yet cannot make hidden springs surge; spring rains bathe the hills yet cannot make withered plants bloom.\n\nBaopuzi says: Weeping blood-jewels must be polished to gleam; the *Chenlumenglao* sword requires a whetstone to sharpen. Fine steeds like *Liuhua* and *Hua* await the royal groom to gallop far; the *Ji* constellation relies on the carpenter’s square to perfect its virtue.\n\nBaopuzi says: The perching phoenix and the soaring *yue* bird, though hungry and thirsty, do not wish to be caged in the kitchens of the palace; the divine *Cheng Huang* and *Tian Lu*, though famished, do not delight in fodder from the imperial stables. Thus, the old man who plucked cicadas forgot all things in the fragrant grove; the fisherman who dangled his line ignored the jade tablet of southern Chu.\n\nBaopuzi says: Square and round differ in form; movement and stillness diverge in purpose. Thus, the celestial sphere is honored for its motion, while the Earth is revered for its steadfastness. The seven luminaries and four seasons complete their revolutions to achieve success; the Five Peaks and Six Pillars stand firm to serve as anchors. Thus, Song and Mo of Chu preserved their states through swift action; Gan Mu and Hu Yuan repelled enemies through inaction.\n\nBaopuzi says: Those who find joy in hills and gardens may suffer in body yet find peace in spirit; those who exhaust themselves for others may rest in form yet labor in heart. Thus, those who carry jars to water gardens rejoice more than the grand ministers; those who vomit coarse grains delight more than those who feast from bronze tripods. Those who abandon their posts to escape the dark may appear dried and withered; those who wait through the night for dawn may weary and shorten their lives.\n\nBaopuzi says: Benevolence and cruelty are as distant as heaven and abyss; good and evil are as distinct as being and non-being. The *Zouyu* treads lightly enough to walk on air; wolves and jackals pounce in packs to harm life. Yu Qing relinquished his minister’s seal to aid the poor; Hua Gong yielded his three offices to recommend the worthy. Li Si, envious of those better than himself, killed Han Fei; Pang Juan, fearing those not his equal, punished Sun Bin.\n\nBaopuzi says: When one’s strengths are properly employed, no talent is discarded; when one’s weaknesses are scrutinized, nothing is suitable. Thus, light silk and misty gauze are exquisite in adornment yet cannot withstand arrows; the *Chenlu* and *Juque* swords are superb in cutting yet cannot be used to pick at one’s feet.\n\nBaopuzi says: Minor flaws cannot mar a great vessel; brief ailments cannot burden enduring talent. The sun and moon bear the food of crows and kites, yet their blemishes do not hinder the splendor of their heavenly radiance. The Yellow River carries the turbidity of mud and silt, yet its towering waves do not impair its flow surpassing the mountains. A tree blocking the path cannot justify abandoning Guan Zhong; seizing fields cannot diminish Guan Yiwu. A stolen wife cannot discredit Xiao He; accepting gold cannot condemn Xiangru. Bribes cannot expel Chen Ping.\n\nBaopuzi says: Tigers and leopards cannot strike and bite amidst waves and breakers; winged serpents cannot ascend on days without mist. When pheasants and hares are the prey, phoenixes cannot match hawks and falcons; when plows and ploughshares are drawn, scaled dragons retreat to their lairs. Thus, warriors and brave men are useless in times of peace; towering scholars and reclusive talents are not prized in eras of striving might.\n\nBaopuzi says: When both are hobbled and yoked by the neck, the swift *qilu* is no different from a lame donkey. When deprived of forests and confined to cages, gibbons and apes are no better than badgers and raccoon dogs. When sheathed and unused, the *Longquan* sword is no different from a leaden blade. When great talent is given petty tasks, the extraordinary are no better than the mediocre. To demand the tracks of a thousand *li* from a tethered steed or to seek the merits of a master craftsman from a petty artisan—this is called lack of confusion, yet I do not believe it.\n\nBaopuzi says: Those who savor bitter herbs and eat mugwort must lack discerning palates; those who discard jade and gather pebbles must lack the wisdom to appraise treasures. To scorn the *Nine Shao* and delight in rustic tunes, I know they cannot commune with spirits or emulate the flight of the *xiang* bird. To rely on the mediocre while possessing extraordinary talent, I know they cannot order the proper norms or attain great peace.\n\nBaopuzi says: Those who grasp the ultimate principle of openness and obstruction are not distressed by adversity; those who understand that fate is inherent in nature do not rejoice excessively in the fulfillment of the Dao. Thus, when entangled in abysses and mires, they cast aside resentment and vexation; when ascending to the radiant throne, they show no elation. After three appointments, such is the man.\n\nBaopuzi says: Prosperity and decline depend on fate; poverty and success are insufficient to judge a scholar. Gain and loss lie in fitting the moment; honor and disgrace cannot measure talent. Timing cannot be forced; encounters cannot be known in advance. Thus, the Grand Duke was a husband abandoned by an old woman; Han Xin was a starving beggar; Xiao He was a petty clerk; Qing Bu was a criminal in exile. When they moved like dragons among lizards and coiled like phoenixes among sparrows, the deaf and blind called their words strange.\n\nBaopuzi says: The four spirit-beasts hide and roam as omens of great peace; recluses delight in seclusion as treasures of the state. Why must one crow at dawn or bear the bit and bridle of duty? There is the use of others’ abilities, and there is the use of my own. Those who follow their nature do not let fame disturb their harmony; those who cultivate life do not let things burden themselves.\n\nBaopuzi says: Those who measure talent before appointing do not seek achievements beyond the capacity of the vessel; those who assess ability before accepting do not bear responsibilities beyond their strength. Thus, those who light fireflies do not trouble the vast sea; those who lift tripods do not employ Wu Huo. To haul firewood and transport salt is not a task for the hooves of fine steeds; petty duties and trivial posts are not enough to bend the extraordinary.\n\nBaopuzi says: The flow of ditches and streams cannot carry the great ships of *Dai Bai*; vessels of a *sheng* or *ge* cannot contain the grain of a thousand *zhong*. Flickering lights cannot reveal the faintest glimmer; mediocre talent cannot distinguish the instruments of the exceptional. For the endowment of intelligence by creation has its roots.\n\n**Baopuzi, Outer Chapters, Scroll Four**\n*Guang Pi (Broad Analogies), Chapter Thirty-Nine*\n\nBaopuzi says: To establish virtue, fulfill one’s words, and preserve unsullied conduct—this is wealth. Why must one seek the grandeur of jade and silk? To hold one’s aspirations lofty, neither yielding nor debasing oneself—this is nobility. Why must one covet the purple and crimson of high office? When the common folk cannot fathom one’s measure and mediocre men cannot weigh one’s scale, this is true elevation. Why must one tread upon clouds or walk the rainbow? When none who inquire can plumb the depths of one’s abyss or those who seek detect any lack, this is true profundity. Why must one dwell in cavernous rivers or the boundless sea? If these four qualities are complete, though one’s chamber holds but a suspended chime of poverty, can one not still envy those who smelt mountains and boil seas? Though one dwells among birds and beasts, can one not still avoid bowing before crimson wheels and ornate chariots?\n\nBaopuzi says: The hidden spirit awaits auspicious clouds to ascend; the soaring swan relies on the stiff wind to traverse the void. The pale-scaled fish leaps only when the maiden’s hair is combed; the white pheasant arrives only when the Duke of Zhou appears. Jiang Ziya met King Wen and cast his line at Panxi; Han Xin and Zhang Liang encountered Gaozu and unleashed their talents to quell chaos.\n\nBaopuzi says: To clarify the spirit in the profound unity is to forget the form and vessel; to distance lofty integrity from external things is to leave wealth and rank behind. Thus, the crippled *Zhilipeng* delighted in transcending creation, and the reclusive *Jisou* of the northern tribes found contentment dwelling in the peaks of Mount Song.\n\nBaopuzi says: Coarse principles cannot fully penetrate perfection; no single ability can encompass all tasks. Thus, celestial bodies shine yet may be obscured by mountains and rivers; gold and jade are hard yet may be softened; firm ice may be melted. The Duke of Zhou could not match Bo Yi in scaling perilous heights; Confucius could not rival the swimmer of Lüliang in braving the torrent of a hundred blades.\n\nBaopuzi says: Thunder cannot refine its sound to harmonize with bells and stones; the sun and moon cannot withhold their radiance to favor those who crave partial light. Great rivers cannot hasten their banks to suit those who wish to cross swiftly; the Five Peaks cannot level their summits to please climbers. Thus, a broad carriage cannot force its wheels to squeeze through a narrow path; a lofty scholar cannot suppress his integrity to conform to vulgar constraints.\n\nBaopuzi says: Yin and yang extend their molding to benefit all things; the Three Luminaries universally illuminate. Mounts Song and Hua conceal infirmities to be called vast; the Northern Sea contains impurities to be deemed great. Eminent scholars advance with decorum; those who master the Dao embrace all with boundless love.\n\nBaopuzi says: The armor of the divine turtle need not be used in battle; the horn of the qilin and claws of the phoenix need not be employed in combat. Thus, the wise do not sheathe their swords in times of peace; watchmen do not cease their patrols even when danger is remote.\n\nBaopuzi says: Southern gold does not devalue itself for dwelling in obscurity; jade and precious stones do not cease their purity for lying in the depths. Those who uphold loyalty and the Dao do not alter their course due to adversity; those who guard integrity do not compromise for lack of reward.\n\nBaopuzi says: Those who ascend the *Xuanpu* realize the lowliness of hills and mounds; those who float the boundless sea recognize the shallowness of ponds and marshes. Only after perusing the Nine Classics does one awaken to the depth of one’s former blindness; only upon hearing the supreme Dao does one know the delusions of vulgar custom.\n\nBaopuzi says: The source of the primordial chaos yields no limpid streams; the root of a hair or down bears no branches of girth. A spark the size of a *cun* emits no distant flame; within a crack or crevice, no radiant throng gathers. A crooked hook casts no straight shadow; upon uneven ground, no level plane appears.\n\nBaopuzi says: Without beholding the brilliance of jade and quartz, one does not perceive the baseness of tiles and pebbles. Without witnessing the patterns of tigers and leopards, one does not know the plainness of dogs and sheep. Only after hearing the nine movements of *White Snow* does one grasp the extreme vulgarity of the *Barbarian Songs*. Only upon recognizing the vastness of refined elegance can one lament the stubborn ignorance of the unlearned.\n\nBaopuzi says: A jade bowl with no use is not as good as a whole vessel of clay; a torn inch of embroidered brocade is not as fine as sturdy, plain cloth. Thus, the impropriety of Xia Ji is not as pure as the solitude of a forsaken woman; the manifold crimes of the wealthy and noble are not as virtuous as the Way-walking of the poor and lowly.\n\nBaopuzi says: Fierce beasts do not unleash their claws beyond measure; hawks and falcons do not spread their wings to strike recklessly. If one within the court does not assess virtue before advancing, and without does not weigh one’s strength, it is like casting a feather into a raging furnace or snowflakes into a boiling cauldron—like morning mushrooms testing the *Ganjiang* sword or calves and lambs challenging tigers and leopards.\n\nBaopuzi says: When the Three Luminaries are obscured in the heavens, the clear light darkens on earth. When roots and fibers are uprooted here, branches and boughs wither there. When the Dao is lost nearby, calamity reaches afar; when governance falters above, the people suffer below.\n\nBaopuzi says: Those who focus on the distant may err in the near; those who govern externally may invite trouble within. One who covers the head does not necessarily keep the feet dry; one who shields the belly does not necessarily protect the back. Thus, the First Emperor of Qin built walls to block the Hu, yet disaster arose within his curtains; Emperor Wu of Han unfurled banners across ten thousand *li*, yet rebellion sprang from his own palace walls.\n\nBaopuzi says: Human talent has no fixed treasure; the use of instruments has no constant method. Those who advance or withdraw do so by adapting to the times; those who drive or restrain do so by aligning with the moment. Thus, when dark ice forms, the Five Brightnesses are set aside; when scorching summer blazes, furs and stoves retreat. When high-flying birds gather, fine bows are drawn; when cunning hares multiply, swift hounds run. When weapons rise, warriors rouse; when the *Shao* and *Xia* resound, literati emerge.\n\nBaopuzi says: Those who stir the current to join the morning river cannot abandon the Five Cities to leap the Jishi Mountains; those who unfurl emerald leaves and sprout crimson blossoms cannot forsake their mighty roots to discard their lush branches. To lose the source and sever the root is seldom not to wither; to rebel against the sages and violate the classics is seldom to achieve success.\n\nBaopuzi says: The Four Seas distinguish their sources; the Five Rivers diverge in their courses, yet all flow downward to the sea. Different paths lead to the same end; colors vary yet all are beautiful; sounds differ yet all evoke sorrow; fragrances are not uniform yet all are sweet; flavors are unequal yet all are delightful.\n\nBaopuzi says: Things are valued for their utility, while ornamentation is secondary. To transform customs with virtue is primary; words are secondary. Thus, plain cloth can ward off cold—there is no need for sable and fox; unadorned simplicity can craft things—there is no need for eloquent embellishment.\n\nBaopuzi says: When the gentle breeze stills, tumbleweeds drift; when the great net is spread, a myriad eyes align. Thus, there has never been a ruler who cherished humility yet whose subjects were arrogant, nor a lord who scorned treasures yet whose people were impoverished.\n\nBaopuzi says: Some matters succeed through precaution; some things achieve the distant through near governance. Thus, to tend the pond at one’s steps may draw deep-swimming fish from the rivers and seas; to enrich the grove of the eastern sun may summon divine birds from the cinnabar caves. To carve images upon plates and basins may bring jade dragons down from the *Xuan* skies; to cast ashes upon a foot of water may alter the moon’s chariot in the great ultimate. Thus, Duke Wen of Jin turned his wheels at Yong and brave warriors flocked to him; Goujian of Yue bent his back before the angry frog and his soldiers embraced death lightly. The Nine-Nine was revealed, and the hidden talents of *koujiao* arrived; the bones of the dead were buried, and the benevolence of the Three Divisions spread.\n\nOpuzi says: Fertile soil lies in the roots, and withered leaves bear blossoms; when the common folk take the ruler’s person as their model, transformation occurs without words. Thus, the Tang achieved great peace through deer-fur robes, and Duke Huan of Qi curbed extravagance by discarding purple. The construction of Zhanghua Terrace led to the excess of grand mansions, while the abandonment of Lutai brought about the spread of profound silence.\n\nOpuzi says: The keen-eared discern the rise and fall in the echo of vanished sounds; the perspicacious perceive the workings of fate before signs take shape. Thus, the men of Yue saw in Duke Huan of Qi the symptoms of decline in an unnoticed illness, and Jizi recognized in the ivory chopsticks of Yin the coming disaster of Lutai.\n\nOpuzi says: Heaven and Earth cannot dispense with spring and autumn to complete the year; a wise ruler cannot forsake punishment and virtue to achieve order. Thus, executing the noble establishes authority, and rewarding the lowly encourages goodness. If penalties reach the high, then the sprouts of treachery are crushed—this is not something the weak can accomplish. If kindness extends to the lowly, then distant people are drawn near—this is not something the miserly can achieve.\n\nOpuzi says: He who sails the vast sea must carefully observe the winds and qi to secure safe passage; he who governs must tremble at the thought of gain and loss to enjoy enduring blessings. What the benighted ruler dismisses is precisely what the enlightened ruler values; what a ruined state discards is precisely what a well-ordered age practices.\n\nOpuzi says: A hair’s breadth of error in the trigger deranges the entire aim; a misstep in granting or withholding here confounds right and wrong there. When good and evil are confounded, the constant norms are subverted; when merit and fault are unweighed, all undertakings collapse. Thus, the wise ruler’s rewards resemble spring rain, free from the excess of ceaseless downpours, while his punishments are like autumn frost, devoid of untimely severity.\n\nOpuzi says: For one who wields the scales of justice, what is weighty cannot be falsified; for one who relies on law and measure, what is beloved cannot be made private. Thus, he who gains men first gains them in himself; he who loses men first loses himself. There has never been one who gained himself yet lost others, or lost himself yet gained others.\n\nOpuzi says: The enlightened ruler personally wields authority and favor, never entrusting another with the instruments of power; the benighted ruler inverts shield and spear, though he calls it honor, his power slips away. Thus, to control rewards and punishments and thereby win the multitude was how Tian Chang usurped Qi; to monopolize authority and dominate the court was how Wang Mang overthrew Han.\n\nOpuzi says: Fixed regulations cannot meet changing circumstances; a single path cannot respond to boundless directions. Carving a mark on a boat cannot retrieve a lost sword; gluing the zither’s pegs cannot harmonize clear tones. Thus, emerald canopies are not raised in fair weather, nor vermilion wheels used in crossing streams. If the flavor is bland, add salt; if the pot boils over, add water and reduce the fire.\n\nOpuzi says: Cinnabar writs and iron tallies, the slitting of animals and smearing of blood cannot remedy the harm of broken promises—then even knotted cords would suffice for governance. The full might of the Five Punishments, the Nine Campaigns, and the extermination of clans cannot halt the treachery of covetous men—then even the shield-dance would suffice for transformation. Thus, the *Book of Documents* contains texts revered through the ages, and the *Book of Changes* adapts to the needs of the time.\n\nOpuzi says: One who possesses the clarity to recognize truth cannot be deceived by falsehood; one who possesses the wisdom to fathom depths cannot be deluded by shallowness. Otherwise, one might mistake vipers for winged dragons and foxes for qilin and phoenixes.\n\nOpuzi says: The world may praise in unison, yet the praised may not be worthy; custom may condemn with clamor, yet the condemned may not be evil. Thus, to welcome and approve is not as good as examining their deeds and testing their use; to reject and oppose is not as good as hearing their words and assessing their results. Then flatterers will not advance through empty talk, nor will true ability be set aside for its solitude. If the slow nag ceases to aspire to the grand chariot, and the warhorse gallops like lightning, how great the achievements that can be built, how distant the Dao that can be reached!\n\nOpuzi says: Rotten wood cannot withstand the wind of a collapsing mountain; a cliff with fissures cannot withstand the waves of a deluge. Thus, the seven hundred years of Zhou’s mandate and the thirty reigns of its kings were not solely due to the victory at Muye or the defeat of the inverted spears; the disaster of Lutai did not begin on the morning of *jiazi*. Its strength had long waned, and its fall was long assured.\n\nOpuzi says: To value the distant and despise the near is the common sentiment of men; to trust the ear and doubt the eye is the affliction of all ages. Thus, the King of Qin sighed over Han Fei’s writings and imagined his person, and Emperor Wu of Han was moved by Sima Xiangru’s prose and regretted not living in the same era. Yet when they finally obtained them, they could not elevate them—some accepted slander and executed them, others relegated them to idle posts. This is like Lord Ye, who loved the false form but paled at the sight of the true dragon.\n\nOpuzi says: A pearl does not shine at night and is no different from desert gravel; a kun fish that does not soar to the heavens is no different from a peach pit. A swift steed that swallows its voice mingles with the mute; a talent of surpassing ability, if suppressed, joins the ranks of the mediocre. Thus, the eel and loach disdain the crimson dragon in the muddy depths, and the slow nag defiles the fine steed in the field—unaware that when still, they are the same, but when moving, they differ.\n\nOpuzi says: Cast gold and jade upon the road, and passersby will halt; abandon brocade and fine silk in the mire, and onlookers will gasp in shock. Yet when men of lofty virtue are relegated to the company of the vulgar, or instruments of statecraft are discarded in straitened circumstances, critics do not protest their humiliation, nor do the successful rescue them from poverty. Some praise their writings yet stifle their persons; others employ their strategies yet forget their merit. This malady has persisted for ages.\n\nOpuzi says: If the source is not deep, its flow cannot embrace the mountains; if the peak does not soar to the heavens, its clouds cannot blanket the sky. If wealth is not abundant, its generosity cannot be vast; if talent is not far-reaching, its words cannot be rich. Thus, seeing tusks a yard long, one knows they did not grow from a mouth an inch wide; seeing branches a hundred fathoms long, one knows they did not sprout from the tip of a hair.\n\nOpuzi says: The divine phoenix rises at dawn in the cinnabar caves and gathers at dusk on the terraces of Xuanqiu; before the sun has shifted its shadow, it has traversed the nine realms, riding the wind and treading the clouds without hindrance—all because its six pinions are light and strong. The great talent and profound wisdom of men are likewise the six pinions of the state.\n\nOpuzi says: The waters of the Qi and Wei cannot flow back, yet their distant currents cannot be without ripples; the stirring of dust cannot be without sound, yet its mournful tones cannot be without cause. The virtue that surpasses the common and stands above the crowd cannot establish merit in times that have not yet arrived.\n\nOpuzi says: Vermilion and green adornments do not bloom on withered branches; the torrents of a collapsing mountain do not rise from a dried-up spring. The radiant flame of a night’s glow cannot reveal the forms of all things; the exhaustion of ambition and profit cannot make fragrant winds endure through the ages.\n\nOpuzi says: A deep abyss that does not penetrate the earth cannot harbor leviathans that swallow boats; a towering mountain that does not reach the heavens cannot conceal jade and pearls or summon clouds and rain. One whose virtue does not transcend the common cannot gather a resounding reputation or establish profound substance. One whose resolve does not stand apart from the crowd cannot attain success or inscribe illustrious merit. Yet the mediocre man performs a cicada’s-wing good deed in the morning and expects the benefit of hills and mountains by evening—like planting millet and sorghum and sitting to demand a bountiful harvest.\n\nOpuzi says: One who bears no conduct surpassing the vulgar yet seeks the reputation of a lofty gentleman, who lacks the foundation of the Dao and its arts yet schemes for cliques and factions, desires to gather purity and nobility in this life and spread a virtuous name to posterity—this is like hiking up one’s robes to cross the vast sea or standing on tiptoe to leap the Nine Heavens.\n\nOpuzi says: A clay dragon, though painted in brilliant hues, cannot answer the summoning of auspicious clouds; a carved bird, though adorned with azure and gold, cannot rise on the wind’s ascent. A straw dog, though bedecked with gold and jade, cannot tread the light and halt in flight. Mediocre talent, though laden with favor and emolument, cannot make the heavens clear and the earth level.\n\nOpuzi says: When poisoned porridge is set out, rats with rotting guts gather beside it; when a bright torch is raised at night, moths cluster below to die. Where fine meats and grains abound, the cauldron and cutting board are ever in use; where small talent bears great responsibility, tears of blood flow like mulberry and huo leaves serve as warning. How grave the lesson of Fan Li, how clear the mirror of Fan Sui!\n\nOpuzi says: The vast sea, though it churns waves a thousand miles wide, cannot sweep the dust from mountain peaks; the howling wind, though it snaps trees of a thousand blades, cannot uproot the tender roots of grass. The roar of a tiger cannot intimidate a mosquito; towering talent cannot harmonize with the vulgar crowd.\n\nOpuzi says: Unyielding resolve is the master of merit and fame; unflagging diligence is the teacher of all virtues. One who does not halt before perilous heights when climbing a mountain will surely reach its loftiest ridges; one who does not complain of hardship and adversity in poverty will surely perpetuate a noble reputation.\n\nOpuzi says: The magpie, though not long-lived, cannot be denied its use as an instrument to save lives; scholars, though often poor and lowly, cannot be denied their ancient canons as tools to cultivate virtue. There are times when sowing yields no harvest, yet farming cannot be abandoned; there are times when practicing benevolence and righteousness brings misfortune, yet conduct and endeavor cannot be neglected.\n\nOpuzi says: Overloading without cease is what sinks my boat; advancing blindly and forgetting retreat is what endangers my person. Though a swarm of scorpions gathers on the body, its root may seem secure, yet it is surely a sign of impending collapse.\n\nOpuzi says: Auspicious clouds arise for the dragon’s ascent—not something a lizard or skink can summon; the whirlwind heralds the tiger’s charge—not something a fox or raccoon dog can bring forth. Thus, when a great man receives his mandate, men of surpassing talent gather like jade and silk; when hidden worthies are sought in secluded groves, the eminent rise from their rustic retreats.\n\nOpuzi says: Metal, by its hardness, breaks; water, by its softness, endures; mountains, by their height, shift; valleys, by their lowness, remain secure. Thus, one who holds to the feminine principle avoids the calamity of contending for dominance; one who exalts others too much invites the misfortune of resentment.\n\nOpuzi says: Han Xin concealed his valor beneath the crotch yet did not diminish his dragon’s leap and tiger’s gaze; Fan Ju concealed his brilliance in a soaking mat yet did not hinder his phoenix’s flight and pheasant’s rise. One became a lord facing south, the other governed the imperial court—thus, now humbled, now exalted, is how the light swan soars the void; now bent, now stretched, is how true talent awaits its time.\n\nOpuzi says: The lowly firefly, though humble in its dwelling, refuses to lodge in the rat’s den; the pure celestial cicada, though starving, disdains the dung beetle’s feast. Thus, Yu Rang rejected the gifts of Zheng and Yang; Zeng Shen scorned the treasures of Jin and Chu.\n\nOpuzi says: The whirlwind cannot stir the great sea’s waves; a hair’s tip cannot move a bell of ten thousand jun. Thus, Zhuangzi of Qiyuan sighed over casting away his gold; Bo Shi mourned Qi with tears of blood. A brief tune cannot summon refined harmony; power and profit cannot sway the heart of one who dwells in tranquility.\n\nOpuzi says: The bear and brown bear do not contend in agility with the fox; the golden eagle does not compete in striking with the small sparrowhawk. Thus, Zhang Er concealed his strength as a gatekeeper; Zhu Hai hid his valor as a butcher.\n\nOpuzi says: The fish is bewildered by fragrant bait; the tiger dies in the cage. The fox cannot be lured with a fishing line—that which comes must be a horned dragon; the unicorn cannot be enticed by snares and traps—that which is caught must be a qilin.\n\nOpuzi says: The soaring cloud knows not the filth of the mud-dweller; the noble rarely consider the toil of those below. Yet when roots rot, even the finest timber cannot preserve its thousand-mile luxuriance; when the people resent, even Yao and Shun cannot rely on enduring blessings.\n\nOpuzi says: Though a tree’s roots lie in sacred mountains, the master carpenter will still fell it with axe and adze; though a small fish dwells in the dragon’s pool, the fisherman will still cast his net. When mosquitoes gather on the eagle’s head, the osprey dares not peck; when mice nest beside the tiger, the wildcat dares not speak.\n\nOpuzi says: The sacred tortoise is silent yet auspicious; its subtlety is manifest without form. The spring frog croaks endlessly yet utters ugly sounds; its clamor brings only harm to the ear. Thus, the rare voice must resound greatly; the few words must carry weight.\n\nOpuzi says: The people of the eastern wilds despise the refined posture of sitting cross-legged; the tribes of the northern wastes abhor the scholar’s cap. Thus, the loyal and upright are cast out in an age of contention; the refined man finds no place in a world that hates the forthright.\n\nOpuzi says: A ladle of water cannot quench the burning of eight marshes; a handful of earth cannot dam the boiling of Mount Dizhu; a single blade cannot fell the forests of a long isle. Alone, one cannot halt the wrongs of cliques and factions.\n\nOpuzi says: A thousand sheep cannot defend against a single tiger; ten thousand sparrows cannot resist one hawk. A courtyard ablaze with torches does not match the last glow of the sun; a hundred drums beaten together do not equal the lingering echo of thunder. Thus, a court filled with mediocre men cannot set the constant norms in order; a single outstanding man is enough to root and sustain all affairs.\n\nOpuzi says: Unwarranted success is like winter blossoms on trees and shrubs; enduring hardship in holding to the Dao is like bamboo and cypress standing firm in frost. Thus, one who discerns prosperity and adversity through solitary insight, though pressed with blades and halberds, will not lose the true path or change course—how could he deign to flatter and smile to conform to the vulgar? One who embodies square integrity and abides in uprightness, though tempted with fiefdoms, will not betray his nature to follow the times—how could he tread crooked paths to ingratiate himself?\n\nOpuzi says: The crashing thunder cannot produce sound in the deaf man’s ear; the radiant sun, though it illumines the sky, cannot bend its light into a dark ravine. The bitter cold of solid ice cannot wither the winter-blooming flower; the scorching wind, though it melts stone, cannot topple the trees of Xiaoqiu. Thus, even the highest virtue has that which it cannot transform.\n\nOpuzi says: The drawn crossbow, the perilous trigger, the keen arrowhead—these are indeed to be feared, yet the bold pheasant rushes toward them without suspicion. Dark governance and chaotic rule, malice toward the upright and envy of the capable—these are most difficult to fathom, yet the greedy vie for them without avoidance. Thus, flying blades assail them unawares, and sudden ruin overtakes them before they can rally. Therefore, what delights the foolish man is precisely what the enlightened man laments. What mediocre talent pursues is precisely what great wisdom shuns.\n\nOpuzi says: When the wind does not cease, the fan is not needed; when the sun does not set, the candle is not lit. When blossoms do not fall, fruit does not form; when the bank does not erode, the valley does not fill. When the Nine Provinces are at peace, the merits of Han and Bai do not stand out; when a long-reigning lord succeeds the throne, the achievements of Yi and Huo do not arise. Thus, only in illness does one value the skilled physician; only in troubled times does one esteem loyalty and integrity.\n\nOpuzi says: Those who covet glory delight in praise, while those who dread disgrace abhor slander. Yet for one who penetrates the primordial unity, who harmonizes with the transformations of creation, who blends fullness and emptiness into a single strand, who equalizes gain and loss with a single gesture—love and hatred never begin to bind him, and success or failure cannot disturb his harmony.\n\nOpuzi says: One whose spirit is not muddied by gain or loss is utterly pure; one whose harmony is not adulterated by advantage or harm is supremely refined. Vast and boundless, it cannot be measured by ladle or cup; distant and unfathomable, it cannot be traced by half-step. Rare sound is the greatest tone; few harmonies exalt the self. How profound and remote is the Yellow Emperor’s Way—it does not share in the emptiness of death. How great is the matter of life and death—yet it does not alter one’s steadfastness. Why trouble oneself over trifling distinctions?\n\nOpuzi says: Where trees grow dense, the carpenter enters; where pearls are fine, the oyster is split. Stones containing gold are smelted; herbs bearing medicine are plucked. Sharp blades dull first; mournful strings break soon. When used to suit oneself, they are the true treasures of the perfected. When talent aligns with worldly demands, it invites the calamities of skill.\n\nOpuzi says: When the target is set, arrows fly toward it; when a fine reputation arises, slander and abuse assail it. Hoarding rare treasures does not invite resentment, yet resentment comes; when vessels are full and ambition proud, disaster is not summoned, yet disaster arrives.\n\nOpuzi says: Treasures worth a thousand cities cannot be purchased by the poor and humble; vessels of towering stature cannot be recognized by the shallow and vulgar. Yet a foot-long gem does not dim its luster for lack of appreciation, and a man of surpassing virtue does not diminish his integrity for being obstructed. Rejoicing in Heaven and submitting to fate—what grievance, what blame?\n\nOpuzi says: The great roc has no use for dawn’s vigilance; the giant elephant possesses no talent for swift pursuit. Thus, Jiang Wan failed in a hundred-li march yet became a paragon of the Three Excellencies; Chen Ping was exhausted in managing his household yet harbored the strategies of six ruses.\n\nOpuzi says: Clarity and obscurity are matters of talent, arising naturally and beyond adornment. Success and failure are matters of timing, subject to constraints and beyond force. Lü Shang was not dull in youth nor wise in old age—yet he cast his plain silk and met his moment. Han Xin was not timid at first nor brave at last—yet he rose from dire straits to greatness.\n\nOpuzi says: The galloping steed cannot retrieve past errors; a thousand gold pieces cannot redeem a single flaw in speech. Thus, those who broadly bestow would do better to guard their defenses; those who diligently seek would do better to temper their words.\n\nOpuzi says: The stalwart man loves his state as his family and serves his lord as his kin—thus, disloyal acts do not arise, and his guilt is none. The benevolent man regards others as himself and treats the distant as the near—thus, unforgiving resentment does not arise, and his responsibility is none.\n\nOpuzi says: If dark ice does not form and white snow does not accumulate, the luxuriance of the green pine is not revealed. If custom does not decay and moral instruction does not decline, the purity of unsullied conduct is not distinguished. Only in a perilous state does one sink into obscurity—thus, Zhuang Zun and Lai Xi upheld their lofty disdain for honor. Only in chaotic times does one suffer hunger and cold—thus, Zeng Shen and Lie Yukou spread their renown for forgetting wealth.\n\nOpuzi says: Heaven dwells on high yet gazes below—thus, its net, though sparse, does not leak. The spirit is luminous and upright—thus, its Way rewards the true and punishes the false. Therefore, when kindness and harmony spread through the Nine Regions, the seven luminaries find their place in the boundless sky. When cruelty and harm appear among creatures, the two qi err in the four seasons.\n\nOpuzi says: Heaven’s order holds boundless honor; human rank holds no nobility that violates virtue. Thus, though Confucius was but a commoner, he received sacrifices for a hundred generations. Though Xin and Gui were emperors, their servants would not deign to compare themselves to them. The older Shang Yang grew, the humbler his station, yet the greater his fame. The more illustrious Jie and Zhou’s reigns became, the more their slander grew. Thus, the life of the King of Qi does not match the tomb of Liu Xuan; the palace of the King of Qin does not equal the lane of Zheng Kangcheng.\n\nOpuzi says: Echoes cannot exist without form and sound to manifest them; blessings cannot be summoned without virtue to attract them. Thus, when Yao governed for over seventy years, only then did auspicious stars radiate. When Yang Gong accumulated virtue into old age, only then did golden rain fall. The distant traveler arrives late; the belated benefactor’s recompense is slow.\n\nOpuzi says: When principle is exhausted, one cannot demand excess; when a single attainment is reached, one cannot seek universal aid. Thus, the last ripples of a great wave cannot stir duckweed; the aftermath of a fierce wind cannot lift light dust. The residual force of a powerful crossbow cannot pierce mist; the fading glow of the setting sun cannot illuminate the eastern mountains.\n\nOpuzi says: Though the celestial bodies may dim, they cannot be compared to the steadfast radiance of fireflies and candles. Though the Yellow River may be turbid, it cannot be likened to the clarity of ponds and streams. Though mountains may crumble, they remain loftier than mounds; though tigers may grow lean, they remain fiercer than jackals.\n\nOpuzi says: Had Shennong not suffered nine illnesses, the Way of the Four Classics would not have been bequeathed. Had Yu not endured calloused hands and feet, the blessings of the dark jade tablet would not have gathered. Thus, long suffering is the root of profound joy; brief toil is the beginning of lasting ease.\n\nOpuzi says: Though the golden hook and cassia bait be precious, they cannot restrain the depths of the nine abysses. Though illustrious favor and abundant emoluments be noble, they cannot attract the reclusive man of no desires. Thus, by the Lüliang cliffs dwells a man of lofty stance; by the river’s edge, people ceaselessly chant the *Fatan*. Jade and silk gather in vain at the lane of Master Ziling; empty carriages return in vain from the gate of Xu You.\n\nOpuzi says: Perception and hearing differ; loves and hates are hard to share. Birds, seeing Xishi, take flight in alarm; fish and turtles, hearing the *Jiushao*, sink deep. Thus, the splendor of court robes cannot please the eyes of the naked land; the pure notes of water-chestnut songs cannot delight the ears of the Chu exile. The benevolence of Gugong cannot enlighten the land-greedy Di; the eloquence of Duanmu cannot free the horse-tethering servant.\n\nOpuzi says: The rituals of refined conduct are detested in lands of naked squatting; the craftsman’s plumb line is envied in the workshop of crooked timber. The gluttonous and ravenous despise the unblemished whiteness of plain silk; the cliquish and scheming resent the solitary loftiness of high integrity—just as the merchant hates a rival in profit, and the homely woman resents the beauty of a kingdom’s fairest.\n\nOpuzi says: When the noble man ascends, he advances the worthy and disperses emoluments; when the mediocre man gains power, he vaunts his rank and scorns the scholar. He bestows favors lavishly upon flatterers, employs talent only in petty kindnesses, shares no peace with the wise yet expects rescue in peril, partakes in no joy with the extraordinary yet desires solace in sorrow—like praying for rain from a famous mountain when wildfire already blazes across the sky, or felling trees in Min’s eastern forests when the floodwaters surge above the heavens. Is this not too late?\n\n**Chapter Forty: On Diction and Meaning**\n\nSome say: Heaven and earth’s roundness and squareness are not the work of compass and square; the Three Luminaries’ radiance is not the power of polish and ink. Spring blossoms’ brilliance is not the dye of gradual staining; orchid and angelica’s fragrance is not borrowed from external scent. Know then that the utmost truth values naturalness. Meaning is prized for its rarity of encounter; diction is beautified by its infrequency. Yet surveying past and present writers, few can bring forth untrammeled splendor at the tip of the brush. Most ladle from earlier words—why?\n\nOpuzi says: Pure tones are prized for their refined resonance; harmonious compositions are treasured for their clear distinctions. Thus, the eight sounds take different forms yet share the same tuning; embroidered patterns vary yet the five colors are balanced. Only because the crude has its master and the beautiful its sequence, the grand compositions have no fixed melody, and the great kitchen no set flavor. Timber piles up on Mounts Zi and Yu, yet without the master carpenter, no craft emerges; books are boundless, yet without exceptional talent, no essence is gathered. Why must one seek a thousand trees to build a great hall, or divine words to compose a chapter?\n\nOpuzi says: Talent has purity and turbidity; thought has length and brevity. Though all engage in writing, their levels differ by ten thousand grades. Some are vast and flowing yet lack depth; some grasp truth yet their words are dull. To speak against principle yet excel in craft is but a partial strength, not the talent of comprehensive mastery. Blind to self-assessment, forcing oneself to兼通, straying from one’s ability into alien tasks—how can one avoid ridicule?\n\nOpuzi says: The five flavors clash yet all are sweet; colors diverge yet all are lovely. Human nature loves what aligns with itself and scorns what differs. The style of writing is especially hard to judge. If it merely pleases the ear or suits the heart, few know the profound delight of the nine movements’ savor or the elegance of the *Ya* and *Song*. This is like tasting salt and plum’s saltiness and sourness yet not knowing the great broth’s absence of seasoning; admiring the lightness of floating feathers yet being blinded to the profundity of the abyss’s depths.\n\nThe exceptional and grandly untrammeled soar beyond the bounds of the mysterious and yellow; the constrained and cramped are fettered within cages. Wings have strength and weakness, so flight and perching have high and low; tracks have swiftness and slowness, so progress has far and near. The dull and sharp cannot be tuned with fixed pegs.\n\nWriting values richness and abundance—why must all praise be as one mouth? If it cannot rescue the world’s declining customs, stem the decay of the secluded path, clear the way for the doubtful, or relieve the poor’s want, it is no different from spring blossoms that do not serve as food, or orchids that do not save from icy cold. Ancient poems criticized faults, thus were beneficial and prized; modern poems are pure empty praise, thus harmful and cheap.\n\nOpuzi says: Writers each have their flaws. The deeply afflicted suffer from excessive analogies, redundant expansions, earnest amplifications—wishing to discard them yet pitying to do so, unaware they become burdensome. The shallowly afflicted suffer from beauty without substance, insufficient evidence, glossy skin yet weak bones. If ornate and resplendent, they outshine the seven luminaries; if profound and subtle, they rival the unfathomable abyss. Human affairs, however minute, are thoroughly permeated; the kingly Way, however vast, is fully prepared. Thus, though the body be lowly, the words are noble—through a thousand years, their glory grows ever brighter.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: Following the Root**\n\nOpuzi says: The mysterious, quiescent, and tranquil are the root of spirit and clarity. Yin and yang, softness and hardness are the root of the Two Modes. Towering peaks and deep valleys are the root of mountains and hills. Virtue, conduct, and learning are the root of the noble man. None can stand without a root. Thus, to reach the heights, one must strengthen the foundation; to flourish at the end, one must deepen the root. If village friends are not harmonious yet one busily seeks distant connections, if one’s official reputation is unestablished yet one craves extraordinary prominence—though one may briefly steal empty fame like frost-bitten flowers gleaming in the cold, they will wither before the morning ends. Though one may seize the great treasure unprepared, riding the dust like a flea on a galloping horse, few scales cling to soar on the waves—glancing back, one is already a withered stump on perilous land.\n\nThe sage and worthy diligently strive as if so, yet the shallow and careless scorn thus. With accumulated habit, one forgets the stench of the fish market; in the land of the naked, one does not notice the shame of exposed form. Unless one withdraws from the world without distress, equalizing success and failure, how can one abandon the near and easy to seek the distant and arduous?\n\nTo remedy this flaw, the method is no other: simply elevate the people from the cliffs and crags, employ talent without calculation.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: Responding to Ridicule**\n\nOpuzi says: A guest ridiculed me, saying: \"Master, you embrace the One, conceal your brilliance in the abyss of spirit, turn your back on the world, and wander alone—so remote, so serene. Your resolve is firm, yet hesitation does not arise in your heart; your course is set, yet worldly entanglements do not bind your breast. Boyang took the Dao and virtue as his head; Zhuangzi crowned his work with ‘Free and Easy Wandering.’ Thus, they established towering stature in the nine skies, spread fragrant glory without end. Yet you, Master, hold lofty principles and do not serve, yet write books on the lord’s Way and minister’s duty; do not associate with the world, yet compose critiques of customs and discourses on saving lives. You cherish your own limbs yet compile methods of warfare and defense; do not pursue advancement yet have essays on examining appointments and the rise and fall of careers. I am truly perplexed.\"\n\nOpuzi says: The great order of lord and minister is next to heaven and earth. To find joy in the Dao, whether appearing or withdrawing, is one in intent—what does it matter? The great man adapts to changing circumstances. Laozi practiced non-action, yet wrote his book; the Old Man of the Valley ultimately withdrew, yet composed his work—both discussed worldly affairs. Why must one hold office before speaking of its matters?\n\nIf the vessel is not fine jade or fragrant catalpa, it will not weep; if the essence is not a hidden dragon, wind and clouds will not gather. My talent is meager, my virtue slight, my abilities unfit for governance. Appearance and withdrawal share the same end; action and stillness are one in principle. Must one be a high official to discuss government affairs, or reside in office to discourse on order and chaos?\n\nEver lamenting Zhuangzi’s words and deeds as self-aggrandizing shackles upon the world’s work: though dwelling in the Lacquer Garden, he indulged in wild talk, fond of painting demons and spirits, despising depictions of dogs and horses as too narrow, disparaging loyalty and integrity, slandering benevolence and righteousness. Such carving of tigers and painting of dragons could hardly summon wind and clouds; empty ledgers by the millions could not save the penniless child’s horse from hoof-skinning, nor could a table piled high with dishes fill an empty stomach.\n\nOthers may say: \"Your writings, sir, indicting customs and speaking bitter truths in forthright words, will only incur hatred from those in power and bring ostracism in your time—hardly the way to spread your name, gain renown, and be valued.\" I reply: A craftsman treasures a vessel for its usefulness in urgent need, not for adorning its outer form; a writer values words for their aid to teaching, not for currying favor and amassing praise. If one merely flatters, fawns, and conceals faults with empty praise, how can this correct errors, admonish transgressions, awaken the deluded, or remedy faults? Fearing few will harmonize, one abandons the \"White Snow\" melody; dreading hard sales, one cheapens the \"Liancheng\" gem. I seek nothing from this. Not that I cannot string together florid phrases to please, nor that I do not know forthright words often bring trouble—yet I cannot bear to betray my feelings, bend my brush, or mingle false with true. I wish only for heart and mouth to align, and to feel no shame before the wise who may come after. Prosperity and adversity are fated; success and obstruction are left to Heaven. Why must one’s conduct and words bring glory in one’s own time?\n\nThe noble man, when opening his mouth or moving his brush, must guard against delusion and obscurity, rectify the inclination to echo others’ errors, and grind away the darkness of evasive obscurantism. Yet those who write books merely adorn and play with florid phrases, flaunting abstruse and impractical words, stringing together unverifiable and useless expressions, crafting ornate and empty beauties—such works resemble the \"hard and white\" debates of Gongsun Long or the \"punishments and names\" discourses of the Legalists. Though they may encompass heaven and earth, penetrate the infinitesimal, untie linked rings, separate the inseparable, make bird shadows move not, give feet to chicken eggs, turn dogs into sheep, or speak of giant turtles and long snakes, they merely display cleverness and parade marvels to deceive the vulgar—what difference is there from painting granaries to stave off hunger, gazing at the Milky Way to quench thirst, praising the jade of Kun Mountain to relieve Yuan Xian’s poverty, or perusing a pharmacopeia to cure a critical illness? Mozi carved a wooden rooster to move Heaven, yet it was no match for a three-inch axle pin; Guan Qing cast a golden image of a fine steed, yet it was no match for a nag’s practical use. Lofty words that soar to autumn skies yet cannot be applied—Confucius would not exchange them for his own.\n\n**Chapter 43: Obscuring Analogies**\n\nI have always held Wang Zhongren’s *Lunheng*, with its eighty-odd chapters, to be the crown of extraordinary talent. A fellow student, Lu Sheng, challenged me, saying: \"Jade is prized for its rarity, gravel despised for its abundance. Thus, Fu Xi’s trigrams numbered fewer than ten yet embraced the Two Modes; Laozi’s words did not exceed ten thousand yet fully expounded the Dao and virtue. Wang Chong’s writings fill boxes and pile up scrolls, now entering, now exiting, now Confucian, now Mohist, with words strung together and meanings not always fine—such are the weeds of the marshlands, not to be compared with the millet and sorghum of measured steps.\"\n\nI replied: Those who create are called sages; those who transmit are called worthies. You see only the ranks of transmission and creation but have not heard of limits on their quantity. You, sir, are like one who hides in a burrow’s dimness, unaware of the boundlessness of the Eight Extremities; who clings to the glow of a lamp or candle, ignorant of the brilliance of the Three Lights; who swims in a shallow, stagnant pool, oblivious to the vastness of the Southern Sea; who is mired in the lowly mound of an anthill, unenlightened by the towering majesty of Mount Song. Heaven and Earth are called great because they embrace the Eight Wastes, vast and boundless; mountains and seas are called rich because they encompass vast expanses, containing all manner of things. If, as you elegantly argue, fewness is prized and abundance despised, then the vault of heaven, though vast and all-embracing, would not be valued for its thick bearing.\n\nIn a foot of water, there are no leviathans; on a handspan’s branch, no wings that brush the sky; atop an anthill, no forests of Fusang; in a stagnant puddle, no floods that rise above hills. The giant turtle’s head crowns Yingzhou; flying waves soar above Fangzhang; the great peach rests upon a measuring rope; the Jianmu tree towers over Duguang; the giant kun swims across the heavenly pond; the roc soars to the clouds. Moreover, thunder’s roar cannot refine its sound; the Yellow River’s surge cannot confine its flow; the swiftest steed cannot catch its tracks; the great swan cannot lower its flight. Thick clouds bring fierce rain; a strong bow sends arrows far. Wang Sheng, learned and talented, how could you not grasp this?\n\nYou say jade is prized for its scarcity and stone despised for its abundance. Yet beneath the dark gardens, atop the thorny peaks, in the marshes of the Nine [ ], in the abysses of Zhefang, jade and pearls pile into mountains, night-luminous gems blaze to the heavens—are these not fine? You cite Fu Xi’s few writings, yet the Duke of Zhou, following the *Great Change*, added rites and music; Confucius, composing the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, appended ten chapters—should they be demoted for exceeding Fu Xi and Laozi? Few words fail to encompass the ultimate principle; sparse phrases cannot fully express the myriad affairs. Thus, one must accumulate chapters and volumes to raise the guiding threads.\n\nThe sun and moon ascend to illuminate day and night; the Five Materials arise with different uses; the hundred herbs flourish with varied effects; the four seasons cycle to complete the year’s work; the five colors gather to adorn brocade; the eight sounds harmonize to beautify the *Xiaoshao* melody; the myriad words converge to distinguish the arts and the Dao. Even with wealth piled like Taozhi’s, its use is scant—how is this different from Yuan Xian? To hold the measure of an uncarved block yet write in meager and crude terms—how does this differ from the petty and trivial?\n\nMusic is treasured by those who know it; books are transmitted by those who recognize them. The melodies of the blind musician Kuang may not be understood in his own time; lofty words and refined writings need not fear lack of appreciation or diminish their worth. Moreover, the depths of rivers and seas cannot be exhausted, yet this does not lessen their profundity; the crooked trees of the Five Peaks cannot be counted, yet this does not diminish their towering heights. Though the jade tablet of the Xia sovereign may have a flaw the size of a hair, its radiance and luster suffice to compensate. Though a work of tens of thousands of words may contain unadorned passages, its profound meanings and lofty principles suffice to cover them. Thus, the turbidity of the Four Seas does not compare to the clarity of a jar of water; the leanness of a giant elephant is not the same as the plumpness of a lamb.\n\nYou also criticize his writings for now entering, now exiting, now Confucian, now Mohist. Yet speech issues from the mouth, and writing is speech put to paper. If the brush should not record diverse matters, then discussions should always adhere to one thing. Formerly, when feudal lords sought counsel on governance or disciples asked about benevolence, Confucius answered each with different words, adapting his guidance to the matter at hand and the urgency of the time. This is like the myriad prescriptions for treating illness or the varying points for acupuncture and moxibustion—used to dispel cold with warmth, eliminate heat with cool, with the sole aim of saving lives and preserving bodies. How can one, like a traveler, follow a single road to Qi and Chu without changing course?\n\nThe wealth of Tao Zhu and Bai Gui encompassed not one single commodity—such was their abundance. The creatures of Yunmeng and Mengzhu were myriad and diverse—such was their vastness. Thus, the *Honglie* of Huainan begins with \"Originating the Dao\" and \"Inaugurating Purity,\" yet also includes military strategy and the art of rulership. The writings of Zhuang Zhou treat life and death as one, yet also contain his awe for the sacrificial ox, his admiration for the phoenix, his plea for grain to relieve hunger. If one were to discard a text because its words are not uniform, it would be like treating a pearl in the eye by gouging out the eye, curing damp impediment by severing the foot, eradicating weeds by reaping the grain, or loathing withered branches by felling the tree.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: The Hundred Schools**\nGezhi Zi said: Though the words of the Hundred Schools are not all pure, refined, ornate, or profound, they are, without exception, the lodging of the heart and the concentrated thought of the talented. The orthodox classics are the deep sea of the Dao and virtue; the masters’ writings are the flowing streams that deepen them. Looking up and comparing them, they are like the auspicious stars that assist the Three Luminaries; looking down and measuring them, they are like the thickets that complement Mount Song. Yet scholars cling to a single discipline, wandering a well and neglecting the sea, stumbling in the mire and stagnating in unchanging困境. The masters’ writings draw from the vast and distant, the subtle and boundless, the unfathomable source, and spread forth inexhaustible currents. Their transformations are not bound by the compass and square of rules; their lateral connections do not sink into the crooked paths of deviance. Their style is lofty and severe, their edge difficult to exhaust. Those who favor only sour or sweet cannot appreciate their flavor; those whose thoughts are limited cannot discern their spirit. The ancients sighed at the rarity of talent, and so for a hundred generations, scholars have followed in one another’s footsteps. They do not discard the luminous jewel of night because uncut jade does not arise from the hills of Ban and Shang, nor do they abandon words that aid teaching because they do not issue from the gates of Zhou or Confucius. It is like those who carry water: though their vessels differ, their aim of extinguishing fire is the same. It is like acupuncture and moxibustion: though their techniques vary, their goal of curing illness is equal. Yet those of narrow vision cling to one thing and reject breadth, confusing their thoughts. They do not recognize that accumulating the smallest bits can equal the weight of mountains, or that gathering hundreds and thousands can reach the number of billions and trillions. They are bewildered by the trivialities of poetry and rhapsodies, yet overlook the profound and beautiful words of the masters. They invert truth and falsehood, mix jade with stone, equate grand music with the tunes of Sangjian, and rank dragon patterns with plain silk. How lamentable! How deplorable! And not just in one respect.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Literature and Conduct**\nSome say: Virtue and conduct are the root; literature is the branch. Thus, in the sequence of the Four Categories, literature does not occupy the highest place. Then writing on paper is but the dregs of lees, a thing to be transmitted no more than the straw dogs used in sacrifices or the distinctions of high and low—worthy of ridicule.\n\nGezhi Zi replied: One may discard the fish trap once the fish is caught, but before the fish is caught, one cannot do without the trap. One may abandon literature once virtue is realized, but before virtue is realized, one cannot do without literature. As for the elegance of brushstrokes, the resonance of rhythm, the skill in arranging words and comparing meanings, the beauty or ugliness of their sources and flows, the length or brevity of their reach, the depth or shallowness of their citations and allusions—their differences are so vast that even the space between heaven and a hair’s tip cannot illustrate their remoteness. Their mutual surpassing is so great that even the Three Luminaries shining together cannot compare to their magnitude or minuteness. The sharpness of Longyuan swords and the dullness of lead ingots cannot match their keenness or bluntness. The lightness of swan feathers and the weight of piled gold cannot compare to their lightness or heaviness. Yet vulgar scholars see only the ability to dip the brush and draw on paper, and so they lump them all together. This is why Bo Shi endlessly pondered Zhong Zi, and the craftsmen of Ying ceased wielding their axes. Those who carve and cut may stand shoulder to shoulder, yet Ban and Di alone hold the name of unmatched skill. Those who pluck the zither may be many, yet Kui and Xiang alone possess the title of pure sound. Among a thousand teams of horses in the stable, only Qiji has the price of surpassing the herd. Among ten thousand beauties, only Weishi has the allure that transcends the age. For they far surpass the multitude.\n\nMoreover, to say that literature is but the surplus of virtue and conduct, like ten feet being the surplus of a丈, is something I have never heard before. The Eight Trigrams arose from the flight of the hawk and falcon; the Six Jia emerged from the burden of the divine turtle. Where literature exists, though it may be noble, the root is not necessarily shallow, nor is it necessarily thin where it is base. It is like brocade and embroidery relying on plain silk, or pearls and jade resting on clams and stone. Clouds and rain arise from the smallest measure; rivers and seas begin with the tiniest span. If the principle is truly thus, then the refined discourse is flawed.\n\nIt is also said: The ascending dragon rises slowly, glancing back as it soars into the clouds. The sweating blood horse walks leisurely, breathing deeply as it covers a thousand *li*. Thus, the ant marvels at its ascent without steps; the slow and lame are astonished that it surpasses them without gradual progress. If one gallops within the bounds of poetry and discourse, or circles within the confines of a single classic, viewing the vast and extraordinary with common sentiment, measuring the boundless with a footrule, from childhood to gray hair, one will never attain it.\n\nMoreover,世俗 generally venerates antiquity and despises the present, respects what they have heard and disdains what they see. Though there may be a steed that chases the wind and leaves the dust behind, they still say it does not match the horses ridden by Bo Le. Though there may be uncut jade as bright as two cities at night, they still say it does not compare to the jade wept over by the jade appraiser of Chu. Though there may be a sword that can sever a horse’s leg or carve a cicada, they still say it does not match the swords forged by Ou Ye. Though there may be medicine that revives the withered and restores the rotten, they still say it does not compare to the remedies compounded by He and Que. Though there may be a scholar who surpasses the crowd and walks alone, they still say he does not measure up to the ancients.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: Zheng and Guo**\nGezhi Zi said: Ji Sheng believed that Guo Linzhong of Taiyuan ultimately declined the command of the Three Dukes. His learning was all-encompassing, and his name was weighty in past ages. Moreover, he was skilled in discerning others—one who knows others is wise, and thus he was a vessel second only to the sages. Yet in a declining age, he was anxious and restless, never at ease in his seat, his ambition set on correcting disorder and practicing the Dao, much like Confucius.\n\nI replied: Wisdom or its absence hinges on a single word. Is the flaw in the pivot of the mechanism not enough to cause chaos? Bai Gui foolishly granted him the evaluation of being second only to the sages—this is not easily conceded. What is meant by \"second only to the sages\" is one who embodies the complete model and guards against the world, peerless and unmatched, with no room for comparison between them and Zhou or Confucius. How could such a person be worthy of this rank? Linzhong was outstanding, surpassing his time, his discernment clear and penetrating. Compared to ordinary people, the discussion naturally elevates him, but in reality, he still falls short. This man had eloquence, bearing, and the ability to hold his own, and he was adept at seizing opportunities. Moreover, those fond of meddling acted as his wings, spreading his reputation in all directions. Thus, he was able to leverage this and be esteemed in a chaotic age, praised by those who listen without verifying. When he bestowed a single word of praise, it was weightier than a thousand gold pieces. Wherever he traveled, the worthy and the foolish alike were swept up in his wake, calling it the descent of dragons and phoenixes, the emergence of rare omens.\n\nWhen he spoke, his lingering tones became models to emulate; when he moved, his footprints became patterns to imitate—one might call him skilled at striking the great drum and worthy to raise high the sun and moon. Yet this was no true reclusion. For when he wished to stand in court, the age was in great chaos; when he wished to lie low, he found confinement unbearable. If he leapt forth, he feared calamity; if he withdrew, he found no peace. Thus he wavered, now plump, now gaunt, while the world pursued his bloom and never probed its root, admired his form and never grasped his spirit. So when his bamboo hat rotted in the rain, others still took it as a model, blind to its flaws—all was illusion. The common folk chased his reputation to such an extent that though flaws were plain, none dared point them out.\n\nLinzhong’s learning touched many fields, and he was not without insight into others. Yet he lacked the clarity to avoid error in reality and was blind in self-assessment. When urged to take office, Linzhong replied: “By day I observe human affairs; by night I guard against celestial signs. What Heaven has cast aside cannot be upheld. Now the fortune lies in the hexagram *Bright Obscurity*, in the position *Do Not Act*—a time for lingering in reclusion, not for the moment when Heaven favors public service. Even on dry land I fear the surging sea will overflow and I become its fish—how then could I dare face the gale and ride the rushing waves?”\n\nBetter the mountain caves where spirit finds repose and heart delights in ease—like Pengzu, carefree, drifting, passing the years in leisure. By his own words, Linzhong knew the Han could not be saved, nor was it within his power to remedy; this much he discerned clearly. He should have looked up to the heights of Shang and Luo, looked down to the expanse of the Five Lakes, pursued Master Chao to the towering peaks, sought the Fisherman on the blue-green waves. If he could not bind his steps to the mountain recluses and depart alone, then he should have veiled his light in the deep pools, sheathed his scales, sealed his words in silence. Yet instead, he journeyed from west to east, his mat never warmed, yearning to emulate the sorrowful deeds of Confucius and Mozi. The noble man who grieves for the world wanders the four quarters—yet even recluses mocked and censured him.\n\nLinzhong’s talent was not of the moment, his vessel not peerless. In public service, he could not pacify the ruler or govern the people, transform customs or reform mores. In private, he could not exhaust his brush in writing or trace the Six Arts, yet he flaunted himself, overstepping all bounds. His fame blazed, his renown flourished, and he reaped no small reward. Yet in the end, he advanced without aiding order or chaos, and in retreat left no mark upon bamboo and silk. Observe his rise and fall, his melting like ice, his withering like grass—he differed not from the common man. For no reason, he plunged into the waves, cast himself into the dust, gathered in the capital, mingled with the noble and powerful. Wheels overturned, defenses crumbled, and he had no leisure to rest. Thus his reputation spread like wildfire, the people of Qin and Hu flocked to him, lanes filled with crimson-wheeled carriages, halls lined with scarlet-gowned guests. Chariots crowded the streets, memorials piled high—truly he was a knight-errant, not one who fit the measure of reclusion.\n\nIn an age of the Dao, one who reached such a state would still not be counted among the ranks of the pure and lofty, nor numbered among the hidden worthies. How much less, then, in this time of peril and chaos, is he worthy of praise? Who would not say he was blind to the rise and fall of Heaven and man, deluded about his own strengths and weaknesses? In vain he turned from the path of tranquility and silence, achieving no benefit, yet escaping disaster—this was mere luck.\n\nTo take such a course and claim concern for the world and devotion to the state, aspiring to the likeness of the Uncrowned King, is like a lame man chasing a dragon steed, a sparrow pursuing the swan, a scorched cicada comparing itself to the roc, a shrew to the great elephant. Thus Linzhong may be said to possess talent that dazzles the world, but not the substance of steadfast integrity. He saw all things clearly, and when nearly called to great use, his outward brilliance flared while his inner spirit was hollow, unable to bear the strain. His words and deeds clashed, his mouth spoke of quiet retreat while his heart craved glory and profit. He was no bird nesting in the mystic gardens, no hidden spirit in the ninefold abyss.\n\nTo praise oneself, to advertise one’s own worth—these are the shameful acts of scholars and women. Knowing the impossible, he still imitated the ancients, aspiring to the vessel of a near-sage—where was his stability? Though he spoke of knowing others, such discernment was difficult even for Yao and Shun, a vexation even to Confucius. One whose clarity rivals the sun and moon, who traces beginnings and sees ends, may still err and not always hit the mark—how much more so for Linzhong, whose light was but a flickering candle, his understanding half-right, half-wrong? Yet this was no small achievement.\n\nThus his name weighed heavily in his time, his praises resounded long after his death. What he gained, the world transmitted; what he lost, none recognized. Though he did somewhat sift the nameless scholars from the wilds, point to uncut jade in the hills, he could not advance the loyal and resolute to the court, stand against invaders on the frontier, relieve the desperate from their plight, or break the schemes of traitors in their pursuit. Like Baozi recommending Guan, like Zhong’s promotion of Rangju, Linzhong’s name shook the court, his reputation commanded respect in his day. The high ministers of the three and nine ranks all revered him, his strength could lift talent, his words could raise the stagnant. Yet he only nursed his illness in the capital, gathered guests, and made no effort to mend the crumbling state. He knew men but would not recommend them—what difference is there between this and recognizing fertile soil fit for fine crops, straight timber fit for beams and pillars, yet never plowing to sow good grain, never felling to build the frame? How does this relieve famine? How does it shelter the homeless?\n\nHis refusal of office was indeed a lofty principle; his ceaseless rushing about was also his affliction. Jisheng once said: “In life, Linzhong was a model for his age; in death, his fragrant legacy endures. No great scholar or fine gentleman has ever pointed out his flaws—why then do I alone criticize him? Will I not be ridiculed by future generations?” The Master of Embracing Simplicity replied: “Why should this be so? If my words are just, let them be passed to posterity. Why should I fear the lack of agreement from those who come after? Moreover, many former worthies have also criticized him—only the imperial edicts praised him excessively.”\n\nThus the Grand Tutor Zhuge Yuansun also said: “Linzhong concealed himself but did not cultivate true reclusion; his emergence did not benefit the times. In truth, he sought only to spread his name and nurture his reputation. Street gossip and alley chatter took his criticisms of the court as eloquence, his slander of governance as loftiness. The vulgar prized him, flocking to him like Guo Jie and Yuan She in former times.”\n\nLater scholars, drawn by his fame, could not examine him by the classics of the sage kings or measure him against the conduct of the ancient worthies. Bewitched by his flowery reputation, they competed to take him as their standard, learning from him as if they could not keep up, speaking of him until their ears were full. Even men of middling ability did not perceive the truth—how could the young and ignorant know? The Prefect of Lingling, Yin Bojing, a man of towering talent and resolute judgment, also said: “Linzhong entered the company of generals and ministers, traveled among the feudal lords, elevated private discourse to sway the masses, and wielded influence in the court. What he desired spread like wind and rain, changing prices and altering postures; what he despised was crushed and sunk. Scholars disdained him, and he broke the reputation of the so-called worthy. In times of chaos, to hide and conceal one’s light is not far from the mark.”\n\nThe noble man practices the Dao to aid his ruler and rectify customs. At that time, the ruler could not be aided, customs could not be rectified. Linzhong circled in pure discourse among the lanes and alleys, yet this did nothing to halt the decline of the world or relieve the suffering of the people. The former Gentleman of the Secretariat, Zhou Gongyuan, a man of heroic stature and renowned learning, also said: “To encounter order and assist it is called delighting in the Dao; to meet chaos and save it is called grieving for the Dao; when chaos cannot be saved and one withdraws, this is called guarding the Dao. Yu Shun delighted in the Dao; Confucius grieved for the Dao; Boyi guarded the Dao.”\n\nIn the declining years of the Han, as the world teetered and affairs turned to socializing, Linzhong ought to have roused himself with an empty heart, seeking like-minded noble men to jointly correct and rectify the age. Yet he remained aloof, a lone hero—hardly the proper way to save the world. At that time, even the eunuchs treated their livestock as kin. Though men like Chen Fan and Dou Wu, who held the highest offices as ministers and governors, all revered Linzhong and trusted his judgments of right and wrong, could one not have hoped that he might aid the imperiled and reform customs? Yet Linzhong neither recommended men of action to bring the slightest benefit nor fled into reclusion. Thus, when compared to those like Xu You and Chao Fu, who abandoned their posts to await worthy guests, he was likened to the Duke of Zhou, who nurtured disciples; when avoiding service, he was equated with Confucius; when forsaking kin to rely on the powerful, he was matched with Ziyou and Zixia. Hence, the world confused name and reality, and great disorder grew ever worse.\n\nIf one claims Linzhong was ignorant, how could he be called wise? If he knew yet did not change, how could he be said to grieve for the Dao? In ancient times, the Four Greybeards resembled the Duke of Zhou but could not become him; now, Linzhong resembled Confucius but could not be him. Thereupon, one who questioned this sighed and said: “Then this man was merely one who fled chaos, not a lofty hermit of complete reclusion.”\n\n**“Critique of Mi Heng” (Chapter 47)**\nThe *Baopuzi* states: At the end of the Han, there was a man named Mi Heng, twenty-three years of age. Kong Wenju, though past fifty, held a high rank among the Nine Ministers and was renowned for his literary talent, yet he befriended Heng while the latter was still a commoner. He even memorialized the Han court, recommending that Heng be appointed directly to the post of Gentleman of the Palace. He declared: “When mountains give birth to spirits, extraordinary men emerge together. Whatever I see once, I can recite from memory; whatever I hear in passing, I never forget. My nature aligns with the Dao, my thoughts are as if divine.” Such was his praise of Heng.\n\nHeng traveled to Xuchang, where from the highest ministers and nobles to the worthies of the realm, none escaped his scorn. He never addressed them by their titles, calling them instead “Uncle So-and-so,” or by their surnames, as one would a child. He called Kong Rong “Big Boy” and Yang Xiu “Little Boy.” Only Xun Yu was deemed barely worth speaking to; beyond him, all were mere wooden puppets or clay effigies—lifeless things, no more than wine jars or rice sacks.\n\nOnce, at an assembly of high officials, Heng suddenly frowned, his expression mournful, sighing with sorrow and indignation. Someone mocked him, saying: “Here we have a gathering of heroes—why this lament?” Heng glanced around at the crowd and replied: “Amid these rows of corpses and coffins, how can a humane man not grieve?”\n\nCao Cao once gnashed his teeth, wishing to kill him, but Heng had committed no capital offense under the Eight Laws, and Cao feared the reputation of slaying a scholar. Thus, he demoted Heng to the post of drumming officer. Heng showed no remorse or shame; instead, he tied ox horns to a pillar and played them with his mouth, producing strange sounds while beating the drum. Those who heard could not tell it was the work of one man.\n\nHis criticisms grew even sharper, utterly without restraint. Soon after, he fled and sought refuge with Liu Biao, Governor of Jingzhou. Biao wished to draft a letter to Sun Quan, who had already consolidated power in the southeast with a million armored troops, proposing an alliance to resist the Central States. He had his scholars compose the letter, but none could capture his intent. Finally, he showed it to Heng. Heng read it and said: “This is fit only for Sun’s lackeys, the boys who hold his blades. If Zhang Zibu were to see it, he would be deeply shamed.” With that, he crumpled the paper and threw it to the ground. Biao, dismayed, looked at him strangely and said: “Is there nothing you can do?” He regretted not having Heng tend the fields instead.\n\nHeng asked for paper and brush, then rewrote the letter. The others had produced over ten drafts, all of which Heng merely glanced at before memorizing them. When he finished writing, he returned the draft to Biao. Biao compared it to the originals—there was not a single error. All were astonished. Biao then asked Heng to compose another, and Heng did so without pause, his hand never stopping. Biao found it excellent and put it to use.\n\nHeng’s arrogance grew ever more extreme. The gentry of the province all despised him, and even Biao could no longer endure him and wished to kill him. Someone admonished him: “Cao Cao is known for his severity, yet he could tolerate Heng, who has but a slight reputation. If you kill him now, no wandering scholar in the world will ever set foot in Jing and Chu again.” Thus, Biao sent him away.\n\nHeng fled to Xiakou and took refuge with General Huang Zu, who treated him as an honored guest. Huang Zu’s eldest son, Huang She, traveled with Heng. Passing a tomb, they read the inscription on its stele. After a single glance, they moved on. Later, She said: “The stele inscription we saw earlier was excellent. It’s a pity I didn’t copy it down.” Heng replied: “You only remember the name. I recall the whole thing after one reading.” He then wrote it from memory. At the end, one character was missing due to damage to the stone. Heng supplied half the character and said: “I suspect this should be such-and-such a word, though I cannot be certain.”\n\nThroughout his life, Heng spoke and acted with disdain for others, yet secretly longed for glory and renown. Thus, though he soared through the phoenix groves, he could not hide in the reeds and brambles. His self-cultivation was flawed, his critiques misguided, and he failed to recognize his errors. Hence, he opened his mouth only to be hated, took a step only to invite disaster. With such talents, how could he have found a place in the world or met a natural end? Like a crow’s caw or a fox’s howl, though men dislike the sound, the creatures do not change their cries—what good did it do? The sea of men in Xuchang, with Wenju as his patron and bearing the weight of his support, could not make him content—this much was clear. He was like a man with a fatal illness, beyond even the skill of the great physician Bian Que; like rotten wood or leaden darts, beyond the craft of Lu Ban or Ou Ye. Yet he fled again to the lands of Jing and Chu, where he met his doom—this was the consequence of Heng’s blindness. He sought what he could not attain, not that he could have attained it and failed to use it.\n\nAlas! Let men of talent take warning!\n\n**“The Disciple Asks”** said: “What perplexes me is Mi Heng’s empty reputation.”\n**“You have spoken of his true flaws,”** I replied. “How could I not awaken to your guiding words, casting aside my staff to follow the right path?”\n\n**“Refuting Bao” (Chapter 48)**\nBao Jingyan revered the books of Laozi and Zhuangzi and excelled in incisive debate. He believed that the ancients lived without rulers, a state superior to the present age. Thus, he wrote in his treatise: The Confucians say, “Heaven gave birth to the common people and set up rulers for them.” Could it be that august Heaven spoke so earnestly? Was this not merely an excuse for those who desired it?\n\nWhen the strong oppress the weak, the weak submit. When the cunning deceive the foolish, the foolish serve them.\n\nThe subjugation of the weak gives rise to the Way of ruler and minister; the servitude of the foolish establishes control over the few in strength. Thus, the bonds of servitude and the toil of labor arise from contention over strength and the comparison of wit and folly. Yet august Heaven remains truly uninvolved.\n\nIn the primal chaos, namelessness was prized; all living things rejoiced in attaining their desires. Thus, to strip the bark from pillars and carve lacquer was not the wish of the wood; to pluck the kingfisher’s feathers and rend the halcyon’s plumes was not the desire of the bird. To tighten the reins and force the bit was not the nature of the horse; to bear the yoke and haul heavy loads was not the joy of the ox. The sprouts of deceit and cunning, the exertion of force contrary to truth, the felling of roots to adorn the useless, the capture of flying birds for ornate display—piercing the noses of creatures born whole, binding the feet of those meant to roam free—these were never the intent of the myriad things born together.\n\nTo toil the common people in order to nourish those in office, where the noble enjoy ample stipends while the people suffer hardship—if one could escape death and gain life, the joy would be boundless, yet this is not as good as never having faced death at all. To decline rank and refuse stipends in pursuit of empty fame is not as good as never having had to decline them. When the world is in rebellion and chaos, loyalty and righteousness become manifest; when the six relations are in discord, filial piety and kindness are extolled.\n\nIn the distant past, there were no rulers, no ministers. People drank from wells they dug, ate from fields they tilled, rose with the sun and rested with its setting. They drifted without attachment, content in their ease, neither competing nor scheming, knowing neither glory nor shame. Mountains had no paths, marshes no boats or bridges; rivers and valleys were uncrossed, so none encroached upon another. The multitudes did not gather, so none attacked one another. High nests were left unplundered, deep pools unscooped. Phoenixes and simurghs nested in courtyards; dragons and scaled creatures swam in garden ponds. One could tread upon hungry tigers, grasp vipers and adders, wade through marshes without startling gulls, or enter forests without alarming foxes. Ambition and profit did not arise; calamity and chaos did not occur. Weapons were unused; walls and moats were unbuilt. The myriad things were profoundly united, forgetting one another in the Dao. Plagues did not spread; the people lived out their years. Purity dwelled in their hearts; scheming minds did not stir. They fed at ease, drummed their bellies, and wandered freely. Their words were unadorned; their conduct unembellished.\n\nHow could they amass wealth to seize the people’s property? How could they impose harsh punishments to create pits and snares? Yet when the age descended into decline, wit and cunning arose, virtue and power waned, and hierarchy was established. The rites of ascent and descent, of increase and decrease, were elaborated; the robes of dark and yellow silk, the caps of office, were adorned. Towers soared into the clouds; vermilion and green were applied to rafters and beams. They dredged the steepest peaks for treasure, dived into the deepest pools for pearls, and amassed jade like forests—yet this was not enough to exhaust their extravagance. They piled gold into mountains—yet this was not enough to satisfy their expenses. Indulging in excess and dissipation, they betrayed the great origin of their beginnings. The farther they strayed from antiquity, the more they turned from simplicity, increasing their veneration of the worthy, so the people contended for fame; prizing wealth, so thieves and bandits arose. When desires became visible, the true and upright heart was disturbed; when power and profit were displayed, the path of robbery and plunder opened. The forging of sharp weapons prolonged the suffering of invasion and division. They feared their crossbows were not strong enough, their armor not sturdy enough, their spears not sharp enough, their shields not thick enough. If there were no oppression, all these could be discarded.\n\nThus it is said: If white jade is not shattered, how can it become a ritual scepter? If the Dao is not abandoned, why would one seek benevolence and righteousness? It was the likes of Jie and Zhou who roasted men alive, minced remonstrators into jerky, pickled feudal lords, split open hearts, and shattered shins, exhausting the evils of arrogance and excess, employing the cruelty of roasting and branding. Had these men remained commoners, their natures might have curbed their extravagance—how could they have inflicted such atrocities? Their ability to slaughter and carve up the world arose from their position as rulers, which allowed them to indulge their will.\n\nOnce ruler and minister were established, wickedness multiplied daily—yet one still wishes to raise one’s arms in defiance? In shackles and fetters, one suffers amidst the bitterness of the road; the lord trembles in fear within the ancestral temple; the common people are tormented in their hardship. To restrain them with ritual and measure, to order them with punishments—this is like trying to dam a source that floods the heavens or stem an unfathomable current by plugging it with a handful of earth or blocking it with one’s palm.\n\n**The Master Who Embraces Simplicity** replied: I have heard that when the primordial obscurity parted, the turbid descended and the pure ascended; the vault of Heaven arched above, the expanse of Earth settled below. Heaven and Earth took their places, and from their forms, the distant was drawn: thus, Heaven is honored and Earth is lowly, making manifest the structure of human relations. From the near, drawn from the body: the head and limbs thus illustrate the order of ruler and minister. The pattern of hierarchy has its origins here.\n\nAs for the Great Ultimate in its undifferentiated chaos, before the Two Modes had form—this was not as good as when the dark and yellow were sundered, the Seven Luminaries hung in the sky, yin and yang shaped the myriad things, and all were distinct. From this, we know that birds gather and beasts scatter, nesting in trees and burrowing in dens, eating flesh and blood, wearing grass and straw. Within, there were no distinctions of the six relations; without, no ranks of hierarchy. This was not as good as sheltering in spacious halls, enjoying fine grains and delicacies, wearing embroidered robes and silken garments, facing winter and summer with ease, governing the world with wise rulers, and employing skilled artisans. Offices were established, duties divided, and the cosmos was harmonious.\n\nWhen noble and base were distinguished, people yearned for reward and feared punishment; when power was equal and strength balanced, contention and plunder knew no fear. Thus, sages arose, receiving their mandate from Heaven. Some wove nets to hunt and fish; some observed the stars to drill fire; some tasted plants to select grains; some built shelters to shield from the elements. They prepared things for use, removed harm, and brought forth benefit. The people rejoiced and followed them, honoring them as rulers—thus the Way of ruler and minister was born.\n\nHow could there be deceit of the foolish or oppression of the weak? The Three August Ones and Five Emperors succeeded one another, and the teachings of the Dao flourished. They distinguished right from wrong, encouraged virtue and discouraged vice. Virtue was abundant, punishments were clear, and songs of praise arose. The great transformation was achieved; the steps of the celestial ladder were level; the Seven Governors followed their courses. The phoenix sang in the morning sun; the qilin and unicorn appeared bearing auspicious signs. Dragons emerged from the rivers, spouting patterns; the sun’s elder displayed its radiance in the sky. The imperial wind spread across the nine regions; weapons were stored away in armories. Thus, ritual systems ensured the ruler’s peace, and punishments were set aside.\n\nAs for extravagance, dissipation, madness, and violence—do these necessarily arise from having rulers?\n\nYet Master Bao alone cites the crimes of a declining age while ignoring the principles of perfect governance—why is this? Moreover, in remote antiquity, simplicity and plainness prevailed, for the people had not yet changed; their minds remained as unformed as those of children, free from scheming. This was not because they knew restraint but chose not to act, nor because they desired and yet endured. If person contended with person over the profits of wild grasses, if household strove with household over the lands of nests and dens, if above there were no officials to redress wrongs and below there were only factions bound by heavy oaths, then private strife would surpass public warfare, wooden clubs and stones would outdo halberds and shields, corpses would litter the fields, and blood would dye the roads crimson. Long without rulers, all living things would perish.\n\nAs for the taming of dragons and the domestication of phoenixes, the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* diagrams, the qilin bearing inscribed tablets on its back, the yellow fish surging in the waves, the red birds soaring to bestow teachings, or the triple convergence of whirlwinds—all these occurred in eras with rulers, not in times without kings. Such auspicious omens, pointing to the profoundest mysteries, either manifest the signs of dynastic revolution or reveal the flourishing of perfect governance. If rulers were not aligned with the Will of Heaven, who would summon these propitious responses?\n\nIf you deem chaos and defense as beauty, then Heaven and Earth ought not to be divided.\n\nIf you esteem namelessness as the highest, then the Eight Trigrams ought not to have been drawn. Could Creation have erred, and Fuxi been benighted? The refined discourse of the ancients revered only spontaneity. Pray tell: to recognize the mother yet forget the father is the nature of all living things; prostration in reverence is but a late adornment of the world. Yet nature cannot be left to itself—one must honor the father; adornment cannot be abolished—one must perform obeisance. If you abandon both, how can a child find peace?\n\nIn ancient times, the living had no houses of timber, the dead no coffins for burial. Rivers lacked boats and oars, land lacked carriages and horses. People swallowed poison and perished, fell ill without medicine, and died unjustly without end. Later sages reformed these ways and bequeathed them to the people, whose descendants to this day rely on their beneficence. The benefits of ingenuity and craft are not easily undone. Now, if you were to dwell in the crudeness of nests and caves, cast the dead into the wilds, cross rivers by swimming, traverse mountains on foot bearing loads, discard cauldrons and tripods to eat raw and rank food, abandon needles and stone to suffer natural illness, clothe yourself in nakedness, take a woman as mate without matchmakers—would you not say this is impossible? How much more so, then, without a ruler?\n\nIf the people of high antiquity were like wood or stone, or like ice so pure it does not chill, or could go without food and not hunger, then perhaps it would suffice. But if the desires for clothing and food reside in their hearts, then what they contend over need not be gold or jade, nor need their competition be for glory or rank. Acorns and taro can provoke lawsuits; coarse greens and pulse suffice to incite plunder. The nature of desire sprouts at the moment of receiving qi; the inclination to favor oneself takes root at the formation of the body. Usurpation, murder, and annexation arise from nature itself. If this is so, how could order be maintained?\n\nWhen a wise king sits above, the feudal lords all follow his model, rising at dawn and retiring late, extending the hours of audience, welcoming criticism to correct faults, holding close advisors to account, heeding street gossip for self-examination, reflecting on missteps with evening trepidation. He spreads a cleansing wind to sweep away corruption, sharpens autumn’s severity to discipline all things. His laws are strict, his nets tightly woven: those who transgress are not spared. Executions punish minor crimes; the Nine Punishments chastise great rebels. Yet still he fears wolves blocking the path, laments the disorder of human relations, worries that the arrogation of power will bring ruin to families, and dreads treachery harming the state. Thus he deploys hawk-like officials to impeach wrongdoers, and tiger-like ministers to wield the rod at the four quarters. Were he to cease banishing and exiling the reckless and cunning, allowing them no fear, then Robber Zhi would rampage and plunder, while the good and innocent fold their hands and await disaster. With no lord to defend them, no borders to rely on, how could one hope that all families become Boyis and Liuxias? It would be like carrying a pig and wishing to remain unscented, or leaning on a river and hoping not to get wet; like driving a galloping horse without reins, or sailing a light boat without rudder or oar—how could it be possible?\n\nMaster Bao further objects: Heaven and Earth take their positions, the two qi shape all things. Delighting in yang, clouds take flight; favoring yin, rivers settle. Following softness and hardness, they complete their natures; adapting to the four seasons and eight nodes, they transform and generate, each attaching to what suits it—originally without distinction of high or low. Once ruler and minister are established, however, transformations multiply. When otters abound, fish are disturbed; when hawks proliferate, birds are thrown into chaos. When offices are set up, the common people are burdened; when offerings to superiors are lavish, the people below grow poor. Hoarding treasures, adorning palaces, feasting on lavish spreads, dressing in dragon-patterned robes, amassing idle women within and leaving many men widowed without—seeking rare jewels, prizing strange objects, crafting useless implements, indulging insatiable desires—neither ghosts nor spirits, whence comes the wealth to sustain this?\n\nWhen grain and silk accumulate, the people suffer cold and hunger; when the bureaucracy is fully staffed, resources are squandered on their upkeep. The palace guard consumes without labor; the people support idle hands. The masses lack clothing and food to sustain themselves—how much worse when taxes and corvées are heaped upon them? The people below cannot bear their fate, freezing and starving, violating the law in desperation. The king above labors in anxiety, his ministers below furrow their brows. Fearing calamity’s approach, dreading the failure of wisdom and courage, he offers generous ranks and heavy emoluments to entice them, fortifies walls and deepens moats to guard against treachery. Yet he does not realize that lavish rewards impoverish the people and make ministers arrogant, while fortified walls increase labor and sharpen the art of attack. Thus, scattering the gold of Lutai and distributing the grain of Juqiao brought universal joy—how much more so if one had never amassed gold or hoarded grain in the first place? Releasing oxen in Taolin, freeing horses on Huashan, sheathing shields and spears, storing bows and arrows—this was still deemed excessive. How much more so if one had never raised armies or waged war?\n\nThatched roofs and earthen steps, abandoning weaving to pluck mallows, using sacks as curtains, washing furs for bedding, concubines not wearing silk, horses not fed grain—frugality was taken as a model, a fine tale to tell. This is what Robber Zhi meant when he divided spoils and took the lesser share as deference, or what fish in a drying pool mean when they moisten one another with foam. If one’s person bears no public service, one’s family no tax burden, if one is content with one’s land and delights in one’s lot, if within one has enough for clothing and food, and without no strife for power or profit—then wielding a staff to rob and plunder is not human nature.\n\nThe teaching of symbolic punishments left the people with no crimes; yet the more laws were promulgated, the more thieves and bandits arose. Was it that they lacked avaricious natures while only the rulers were rapacious? No—when the state is tranquil, the people naturally align; when the people are weary and resentful, cunning and deceit arise. To leave things to nature is still to fear violence and oppression; to labor without rest, to seize without end, fields grow fallow, granaries empty, looms idle, food insufficient for the mouth, clothing inadequate for the body—how could one expect order to prevail?\n\nThus, efforts to avert disaster only deepen it; strict prohibitions fail to halt transgressions. Checkpoints and bridges are meant to prevent wrongdoing, yet crafty officials exploit them for mischief. Weights and measures are meant to detect fraud, yet the wicked use them to deceive. Great ministers are meant to shore up peril, yet treacherous ministers fear their lord’s safety is not imperiled. Arms and armor are meant to quell strife, yet bandits and rebels use them to foment it. All these are the consequences of having rulers.\n\nWhen the people see advantage, they contend for it. The wealthy and noble have much to gain. Even petty disputes among commoners are trivial, and the strength of individuals has its limits. Without territory to covet, cities to desire, gold or jewels to crave, or power to compete for, they cannot gather followers or command others. How can this compare to a king’s wrathful display, mustering armies and deploying troops, driving innocent people to attack blameless states, where corpses lie by the tens of thousands, blood flows to float the oars, and the land turns crimson? Wicked rulers have existed in every age, venting their cruelty and disordering the world. Within, no loyal and good men are spared; without, the common people lie exposed in death. Is this merely the harm of petty strife?\n\nAs for shifting filial piety to serve the lord, or replacing devotion to parents with loyalty—even without rulers, such distortions would still arise.\n\nIn ancient times, houses sufficed to shelter from wind and rain, yet now they are adorned with vermilion and purple, embellished with gold and jade. In ancient times, clothing sufficed to cover the body, yet now it is woven with dark silks, embroidered with intricate patterns, and draped in brocades, fine silks, and gauze. In ancient times, music sufficed to settle the human heart, yet now it overflows with frantic melodies and wanton sounds that startle the soul and disrupt harmony. In ancient times, food and drink sufficed to sate hunger and nourish the body, yet now forests are burned, rivers drained, and all living creatures slaughtered. How can one, because affairs have gone too far, entirely abolish them?\n\nIf the sage-kings Yao and Shun were on the throne, with Hou Ji and Yu assisting in governance—living in humble palaces, levying light taxes, and employing the people in due season—if they exalted the pure winds of frugality and strictly enforced prohibitions against extravagant feasts, honoring and elevating those who embraced simplicity and restraint while demoting and punishing those who disrupted customs and encroached upon the people, then songs of praise would arise and the common folk would live in peace. Why must one fear fire and demolish houses, or dread storms and fill great rivers?\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: \"Master Bao valued the ancient age without rulers,\" a claim I have already refuted. The subsequent responses in my writings are too numerous to record in full; I have briefly excerpted his arguments and appended my refutations. Master Bao said: \"Rulers seek rare treasures, gather strange objects, adorn useless things, and indulge insatiable desires.\" The Master of Embracing Simplicity refuted this, saying: \"May I ask—have all emperors and kings throughout history sought rare treasures and gathered strange objects? Were there those who did not? Now, I have heard that when Yao ruled as emperor...\"\n\nThe casting of gold into the mountains marked Yu’s abdication, just as the discarding of jade into the valleys, coarse food, and plain garments marked Shun’s vigil at the gatekeeper’s post—from this it may be known that they neither drained the deeps to carve pearls, nor split the crags to quarry jade, nor smelted cinnabar and lead ores, nor crossed the seas to rend kingfishers’ plumes, nor netted hawksbill in distant lands, nor dug pigments from the Min and Han rivers. When robes and insignia show no distinction, majesty and weight cannot be manifest; when names and ranks are not differentiated, rites and emblems lose their proper gradations. Thus the Duke of Zhou established the canons for distinguishing noble from base and high from low: in palaces and dwellings, the height was limited by the span of pounded-earth walls; in caps, canopies, banners, and flags, ornamentation followed regulated patterns; in carriages, robes, vessels, and utensils, quantities were fixed by statute; in kitchens and banquets, dishes adhered to prescribed standards; in years of famine or disaster, reductions and withdrawals were duly made. Insatiable desires do not belong to the discourse of the Daoist adept; to cite them as proof of Jie and Zhou’s crimes is insufficient to settle the judgment of refined debate.\n\nMaster Bao said: “When the ruler’s rear palace holds three thousand consorts, can this all be Heaven’s will? When grain and silk accumulate, the common people suffer cold and hunger.”\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity refuted this, saying: “The number of a true king’s consorts is fixed by the sage. The sage is one whose virtue joins with that of Heaven and Earth. Since his virtue joins with Heaven and Earth, how could this be mere whim? How could it be merely to gratify passions and sate desires?”\n\nThus it serves to assist the six palaces in regulating yin and yang, to instruct and solemnify the ancestral temples, to serve the divine spirits, to uphold the great sacrifices, to don the dark-tasseled robes, and to broaden the paths of the royal lineage. Moreover, according to the *Records of the Nine Lands* in the Zhou canon and the geographical texts of the Han, the number of women in the realm exceeds that of men—how could the king’s consorts possibly crowd out those who ought to marry?\n\nDuke Ji of Zhou pondered this and seemed to have considered it carefully. The emperor leads the hundred officials in the *jie-tian* ritual; the empress and consorts of noble rank oversee weaving. Extending to the common folk, farming duties are limited, tillage is rewarded, and idleness is punished. A tithe is levied to supply public needs, households maintain reserves for defense, and the state stores nine years’ worth of provisions. Each follows the natural division of labor, none is deprived of their season, taxes are light, corvée labor is sparse, and the people suffer neither hunger nor cold. When clothing and food are sufficient, rites and deference arise.\n\nIn the eras of Emperors Wen and Jing, the people devoted themselves to farming, households were well-provided, and granaries overflowed with grain—so much that the red husks rotted beyond counting. Yet even then, scholars and commoners still dined on fine meats and rode in carriages drawn by oxen and horses. This was because taxation was moderate and did not deplete the people. In later ages, officials abandoned the system of tillage quotas, and private pursuits turned to frivolous trades. The way of growing grain narrowed while idle mouths multiplied, so that both high and low alike transgressed, and offenders abounded.\n\nMaster Bao thus blamed the ruler, but it would be better to criticize the excesses of conscription and selection, to censure the unreliability of farming quotas, to rebuke the three thousand who drink like oxen, and to reduce the land tax to a third or half. If only the rear palace adhered to the Zhou rites and taxes were not levied arbitrarily, this would suffice. Must there truly be no ruler?\n\nIf the ruler rises late even once, affairs will fall into disorder. When entering the forest without a forester, even the deer will elude you—how can this be sustained indefinitely? Without a guiding authority, the noble lose their model, the people achieve their desires, and even a loose net still catches some fish. Can there be no net at all?\n\nMaster Bao said: “For people to live, clothing and food are already burdensome. If one further imposes heavy taxes and labor services, hunger and cold will converge, and the people will be unable to endure their fate, leading them to defy the law and commit crimes.”\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity refuted this, saying: “The spider spins its web, yet fleas and lice do not starve. Human ingenuity harnesses the myriad things to feed mouths and clothe bodies—what hardship is there in this? The problem lies in the rich having no limit to their desires and the noble having boundless expenditures. How can one, for the sake of a single precaution, abandon governance entirely, fearing the cruelty of Jie and Zhou? To say there is taxation and labor service is to invite chaos—then I ask: in the age of peace under Yao and Shun, in the virtuous eras of the Three Dynasties, were there no taxes or labor services to support the ruler and ministers? Did the Son of Heaven and his officials plow the fields to sustain themselves?”\n\nMaster Bao then said: “The king treads as if over deep abysses and tiger tails, his peril beyond comparison. He sleeps lightly, rising before dawn, and eats only after the sun has declined—what cause has he to fear calamity?”\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity countered: “If a ruler truly acts thus, he is a sage-king. The true affliction of kings lies in arrogance and extravagance, in failing to employ the worthy and employing the unworthy. King Jie of Xia pointed to the sun and swore he would not perish; the First Emperor of Qin feared sharing a posthumous name with others, yet both brought ruin upon themselves and became laughingstocks for posterity. If a ruler fears danger, remains vigilant at dusk, broadly accepts admonitions, consults even the humble, nurtures the aged, and seeks counsel from the venerable—what worry is there of misjudgment? What peril is there that the hundred affairs will not prosper? Diligence orders the constant norms; laxity breeds villainy. How much worse, then, if there is no ruler at all—could there be no chaos?”\n\nMaster Bao said: “The king covets rare omens and lures distant lands, seeking to exalt his virtue and magnify his might, dazzling the un-subdued. What benefit is there to the common people in white pheasants or jade rings?”\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity refuted this, saying: “When the king’s virtue reaches Heaven, there are celestial portents; when it reaches Earth, there are terrestrial responses. The radiant star scatters its light to aid the moon’s glow; the solar halo displays its hues to mark the sun’s path. Divine birds sing in the palace towers; golden images gleam upon the clear pools—were these brought about by humble words or lavish gifts? Wang Mang, treacherous and harboring malice, fabricated signs of peace to deceive the court and the realm, even sending envoys to foreign lands to present auspicious omens. Can this be taken as proof that all ancient omens were the same?\n\nSeeing a tail a fathom long, one knows the beast is not a handspan in size; observing fangs a cubit long, one knows the mouth is not an inch wide. Thus, the Queen Mother of the West sent envoys, proving her numinous transformation and boundless influence. The distant state of Yuechang, through repeated translations, came to offer tribute, showing that benevolence had reached even the remotest lands. Remote domains cannot be subdued by force; barbarians cannot be cowed by might. Without perfect governance, how could this be achieved?”\n\nWhy, then, did Master Bao claim such things were of no use? The House of Zhou was not lacking in jade and thus needed the Queen Mother of the West’s ring to be deemed wealthy; nor was it sparing in its meals and so exhausted the pheasants of Yuechang to fill its kitchens. What made these gifts precious was that they signified the attainment of Great Peace—whereby the ruler above was free of harsh and oppressive governance. What could be more abundant than this? To say they were of no use or benefit to the people is to fail to see their profound source and vast import. Was not Master Bao’s remark fitting?\n\nMaster Bao said: “The sovereign fears unforeseen treachery and so fortifies the city walls in preparation.” The *Baopuzi* retorted: “The lords and kings set up barriers—what the *Great Change* values. Why, then, should fortified walls be criticized? When the Two Modes first unfolded and the myriad things were transformed and born, both deviance and rectitude came to be. The sage, knowing that guarding against villainy is natural and that the benighted masses are as hard to change as withered wood is to flourish under spring’s warmth or metal and stone to melt beneath the summer sun, took his model from the *Xikan* and prepared for what had not yet sprouted. With layered gates came the watchman’s clapper as a warning; with military governance came the suppression of violent intruders. Yet to seek their eradication—what principle justifies this? The rhinoceros’s horn, the phoenix’s spur—Heaven indeed bestows them, but must they be used daily?”\n\nThe wasp and scorpion bear venom to defend themselves; the clever bird carries reeds to shield against nets; the badger bends its burrow to guard against sudden assault; the water buffalo forms ranks to repel the ferocity of tigers and leopards. Yet Master Bao would cast aside armor and helmets to advance sharp blades, raze city walls to halt charging forces. If armor and helmets are discarded and sharp blades do not cease, if city walls are destroyed and charges still gather—even Gongshu Ban and Mo Di could not preserve themselves. How, then, shall our lives be secured?\n\nSome say: “If there are no coveted goods, even without fortified walls, enemies will not come.” Master Baopu replies: “Must coveted goods be gold or jade, the point of an awl or knife? The foolish masses contend over them. The great war of the Yue people arose from the unequal division of a python’s flesh; the rebellion of Wu and Chu was sparked by a single mulberry leaf. In times of famine, men devour one another. Yet in the past, bare-handed and barefoot, from afar like Fu Hou and Zigao, from near like Yu Gong, they probed the truth, weighed punishments, split hairs and shaved grains. Those condemned to execution swallowed their voices and sang of virtue; those mutilated by amputation or nose-cutting bore no grudge to their dying day—all this occurred not in a time without rulers.\n\nLong ago, when a widower dwelt in lowliness, the Four Peaks did not conceal him; when obscure worthies were sought, the finest talents were all raised. Some cast aside their butcher’s knives to enter the golden gates; some left their trowels and bricks to ascend jade halls; some abandoned their fodder and hay to become ministers and chancellors; some, fleeing for their lives, became supreme generals. Bo Liu avenged his foe; Xie Hu recommended his enemy; Fang Hui knocked his head to attract scholars; Qin Xi shattered his skull to advance the worthy. I ask: were these times without rulers?\n\nIt is further said: ‘Fields lie fallow, granaries stand empty—all because of rulers.’ But rulers are not the creeping weeds that choke the fields, nor are ministers the sparrows and rats that deplete the granaries. That fields lie fallow and granaries stand empty is ultimately due to calamitous fate—floods and droughts, epidemics and plagues—leading to famine and want. How can this be blamed on the levies and demands of governance?\n\nAmong the Eight Regulations, food is foremost, called the people’s Heaven. Hou Ji tilled the fields himself; the Yu sovereign plowed in person. In years of plenty, millet and rice abound; our granaries brim with grain. Canals are dug to drain alkaline soils, turning them into fertile fields. Shao Fu built the embankments of Yangling, piling grain like mountains; Shu Ao created the irrigation of Qisi, leaving households with rotting millet. Zhao Guo devised the triple-plow technique, enriching the lands west of the Pass; Ren Yan taught the people of Jiuzhen to farm, filling the bellies of the black-haired masses. Were these times without rulers?\n\n*Knowing When to Stop*, Forty-Ninth\nMaster Baopu says: “No misfortune is greater than insatiability; no blessing is richer than—”\n\nTo know when to stop, to embrace sufficiency, and to dwell in emptiness—these are the calculations of preservation. Feasting in ease and abounding in fullness are the perils of what is hard to safeguard. Consider the likes of Shan Juan, Chao Fu, Guan Yin, and Hu Gong: all trod upon clouds and mist to soar aloft, relied on dragons and phoenixes to elevate their traces, discerned the sheathed blade within fragrant bait, and awakened to the overturned cart upon the road ahead. Shunning treacherous paths to avoid crossing, they evaded the hooks of Zhan He—truly adept at anticipating shadows beyond form and glimpsing solid ice in the first frost. They moved firewood before the blaze raged, furled sails and stilled oars before the gale struck, gazed at the nine oxen and sank deep, beheld the dense thicket and swiftly departed. They did not nest at the tip of the reed, nor lie supine beneath the crumbling cliff. Were these not men of vast capacity, profound insight, and keen perception, who surpassed their peers and walked alone, unbound by convention? Their desires aspired to merge with the Dao of creation, their hearts transcended the myriad things. Covetousness could not sting their purity, nor could turmoil disrupt their sincerity. If one lacks such innate integrity, how can it be attained? This is a path beyond the trodden track.\n\nYet those who know success often withdraw, for those who toil greatly are seldom rewarded. When the cunning hare is caught, the hunting hound is cast aside; when the high bird is felled, the fine bow is set to be discarded. Beholding the mirror of Peng and Han, one recalls the art of withdrawing the hairpin; witnessing the folly of the Yue lineage, one recognizes the value of gold and ivory. Like Lord Fan, who sailed away to escape the limelight, or Master Xue, who fled chaos to preserve his integrity; like the Two Shus, who resigned their seals at the height of abundance, or Tian Yu, who relinquished his sash as the candle waned—advancing avoids the calamity of overreaching, retreating spares the regret of trailing wet. Their pure wind is enough to scatter the dust of a thousand years, their virtuous resonance enough to dispel the delusions of ages to come. Compared to Chen and Dou, how distant they seem!\n\nYet some, though wise, fail in grand schemes; some, though strong, break under heavy burdens. Some, though uniquely right, are ensnared by the many; some, though wholly loyal, are impeached by those guarding all fronts. Some, advocating lofty plans, suffer the fate of Chao Cuo; some, exhausting heart and strength, meet the doom of Wu Qi. Thus, even those who tread cautiously and act with restraint may not escape. The Duke of Zhou was exiled, Confucius departed, Jia Yi was banished to the hinterlands, Sima Qian was branded innocent yet punished, Le Yi pacified Qi, Wu Zixu shattered Chu, Bai Qi expanded the realm with a hundred victories, Wenzi dominated Yue with nine strategies, Han Xin’s merits towered over the world, Qing Bu destroyed his family to aid the mandate—yet glory did not last a day before humiliation followed, nor did they shrink from its disaster. Were these truly wise men?\n\nTo serve as a minister is no easy task; in short, the crux lies in choosing one’s lord. I am not worthy to rely upon—such is the proof. To resign, yield to the worthy, preserve purity, and secure peace; to gain a fine name and ample reward—what greater fortune could there be? To cultivate this art is to grasp one in ten thousand chances. As fortune and misfortune are shaped by man, can one afford not to ponder this?\n\nThose words that grate upon the ear are seldom met with joy; offerings of counsel bring honor, yet may invite ruin or disaster. When slander arises, how can one find the leisure to verify what to accept as true? When snares and nets fill the skies, even the fledgling mandarin duck hesitates to spread its wings; when pits and traps line every path, the unicorn and the sacred tiger retreat into hiding.\n\nThe passions cannot be indulged without limit, nor can desires be sated without end. The enlightened master their emotions through the Dao and dispel desires through strategy—how much more should those who scheme for others ensure loyalty, let alone fail to deliberate when plotting for themselves?\n\nFor the contented, there is ever sufficiency; the insatiable know no sufficiency. Constant sufficiency draws fortune, while insatiability invites calamity. To nourish life excessively is to hasten its end. The Song clan uprooted their seedlings, and the people of Ying exulted in Zhang Hua’s rise—yet their haste brought only withering and ruin. To know advance but forget retreat is to court destruction.\n\nFew who race without restraint avoid stumbling; rare are those who tread waves without end who escape drowning. To wield blades without cease invites wounds; to strike without pause courts breakage. That fullness must yield to loss is the principle of nature—does the vessel of Zhou’s ancestral temple deceive us? Thus, when Yang You shot his arrows, passersby warned him to guard against the wind; when Dongye drove his chariot, Yanzi foresaw his downfall. Success and failure are not easily long endured.\n\nThe drinker need not always descend into chaos, yet most who do are drunk; wealth and nobility do not invariably lead to peril, yet peril often lurks within them. The wise foresee events in their earliest stirrings, fell trees at the first sign of a bud, refrain from boasting when blocks are stacked precariously, and discuss mending furs only after gathering all the fox pelts. The ancients feigned madness or folly—was this their delight? The times demanded it; they had no choice.\n\nSome flee deep into the wilds only to meet waves, or hide in seclusion only to face fire—like Gong Sheng, who starved himself to death, or Li Ye, who swallowed poison in despair. Such fates arise from traces left behind, shadows that cannot be erased. Had their conduct been as cautious as treading ice, their bodies as still as dwelling in shade, their movements leaving no track to follow, and their quietude merging with non-action—would such misfortunes have befallen them? How much less for those who brandish the sun and moon to conceal their forms or beat war drums to seize weapons!\n\nIn an age of clarity, one may excel in aiding all under heaven; in an age of peril, one may barely preserve a single life. This lament is not unique to one scholar.\n\nI have heard that no blaze is unquenched, no excess unchecked; brilliance bears the seeds of ash, and spring’s blossoms foretell autumn’s decay. The sun reaches its zenith and then declines; the moon waxes full and then wanes. The sequence of the four seasons ensures that all who achieve success must retreat. Observe the world: the loftiest structures, once they reach their limit, crumble. Turn to oneself: even fine meals and restrained drink, if immoderate, breed illness and harm one’s nature. How much more for those whose ambitions soar to the clouds without cease, whose power shakes rulers and whose honors mount without end?\n\nThe gnat guards against falling from a mountain only to soar freely, while the rhinoceros and tiger, if they plummet, shatter like scallions—this illustrates that great things cannot lose their proper place.\n\nMoreover, when one in upright authority rebukes transgressions and follows the straight Way, when one strikes down those who violate discipline without considering enmity or grudges, resentment deepens and hatred accumulates. Yet if one abandons the law to indulge wrongdoing, if one heeds private pleas like an echo, if one spits out the hard and swallows the soft, bending the rule like a carpenter’s line—does not dwelling in such a position become wearisome?\n\nThus, those who preserve both body and reputation are exceedingly rare, while those who stumble and overturn their cauldrons are not few. Yet within, they recline in ornate chambers with graceful maidens, crimson curtains, and patterned canopies, their couches spread in lavish halls. Radiant beauties dazzle at their sides, their lithe forms and soft voices weaving songs of exquisite artistry—melodies like those of Song Yu and Cai Yong, the grace of *Yang’e*, their lips singing *Cai Ling* and *Yan Lu*, their feet tracing the steps of *Lü Shui* and the *Seven Disks*. Harmonious notes delight the ear, enchanting postures gladden the heart. Secret feasts follow one another, fine wine never withdrawn. Looking up, they ascend carved pavilions; gazing down, they reflect upon clear pools. They wander among fruit groves of crimson and emerald, sport in orchid gardens fragrant with blossoms. Patterned fish glide through the waves, red-feathered birds soar and wheel, arrows bring down swans from the clouds, chariot wheels drag bream and carp from afar. Rare treasures gather without seeking, luxuries arrive unbidden.\n\nAbroad, their vermilion wheels gleam on the roads, lofty canopies press wheel to wheel, crimson banners billow like clouds, insignia and batons command awe, golden drums clamor, halberds and armor glitter. Proudly they ride in the rear carriage, their fine escorts filling the ranks. Their retinues exhaust the pleasures of sightseeing, their hunts and fishing reach the height of joy. Praise for their sagely brilliance fills their ears, while flattering words, spoken with one voice, dismiss the ancients—claiming Yi, Lü, Guan, and Yan are not their equals. How could they perceive the rise and fall as head and tail, joy and sorrow as morning and night? How could they willingly relinquish their exalted glory, beg to return their bones to the earth, turn their backs on vermilion gates, and return to the hills and gardens?\n\nNow, if a sagely enlightened ruler sits above, great worthies assist in governance, the hundred offices are ordered only through them, and the myriad people are saved only through them—those who stand high without fearing peril, who are full without fearing excess—these are not the ones under discussion.\n\n**Chapter Fifty: On Obscurity and Eminence**\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Men of the same talent may yet meet with obscurity or eminence—what is the reason? Does this bind the swift and free, leaving them with regret?\"*\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity replied: *\"When abilities are no different, yet some are suppressed and others exalted, it is because they lack a true patron—thus, adversity and prosperity depend on the times. Success and failure are matters of fate. Those who discern the times—why lament their depths? Those who understand fate—why resent their lowly toil?*\n\n*The *Zhanlu* and *Chungou* swords are of the finest steel, yet if not wielded, they cannot even sever morning mushrooms. The *Yaohua* and *Lilü* are treasures beyond price, yet if cast into the mire, tiles and pebbles pile upon them. Thus, things may be precious yet not necessarily prized, may be useful yet not necessarily employed.*\n\n*The vulgar, blind to distinctions, cannot tell red from purple, nor beans from wheat. They deem the eminent worthy merely because they have risen, unaware that what they seek is but fleeting success. They scorn the obscure as inferior, yet do not examine those who uphold the Dao and remain in obscurity.*\n\n*Moreover, the celestial bodies, if not fixed in the heavens, cannot radiate their great light to illumine all without exception. Mount Song and Mount Tai, if not rooted in the earth, cannot tower to the clouds. The hare’s swiftness depends on level ground to gallop, the dragon’s boat rides the rushing currents to display its speed. Fire’s brilliance did not blaze until Suiren, the sharpness of Chu steel was not honed until Ou Ye. Luxuriant blossoms await spring to display their splendor, soaring swans rely on the gale to glide lightly.*\n\n*If the Four Mountains do not commend the worthy, then even the most capable remain unrecognized. If Ya did not recommend Guan Zhong, then Yi Wu would not have been employed. Rangju owed his rise to Pingzhong, Han Xin’s soaring began with Xiao He. Junsheng’s eloquence came from Shengzhi’s counsel, Qu Ni’s advancement stemmed from Wuzhi’s recommendation. Kongming emerged from Longzhong, Gongjin’s fame arose from Gongwo’s support. Thus, their illustrious names were recorded in the imperial annals, their meritorious deeds inscribed in their era.*\n\n*But in the late years of the Han and the final days of Wu, it was not so. In their selection of scholars...\"*\n\nThey invariably favored those who aligned with themselves, making such attachment the foremost criterion for selection. Those with many factions were invariably chosen, yet those who aligned with them were not necessarily vessels fit for advancement. Those who echoed their own views could not be cast aside, yet those with many factions were not necessarily talents surpassing the common herd. Trusting the clamor of the crowd, they deemed such men worthy; or, believing these to be mediocre and base, they could not relinquish their attachment to the familiar and the near. Or, recognizing those others as exceptional and outstanding, they could not maintain impartiality in utmost fairness. Thus, they cast aside the scales of assessment and took frequency of association as the measure of weight; they abandoned standards of measure and took the density of connections as the gauge of quantity. At such times, those so-called refined men of lofty bearing who wielded the state’s power of promotion and demotion—whose decisions of praise and censure were dictated by mere words—were rare indeed to escape this entanglement. How much more so when, in their hearts, they suddenly harbored hatred, stood alone in resentment, envied those not of their faction, or despised the independent and superior, or scorned the poor and unconnected?\n\nAlas! The scholars of distant custom and the men of unparalleled distinction—those who, generation after generation, failed to meet with recognition—cannot be numbered. Some were suppressed and languished in marshes and wilds; others stood in court only to be cast out. Some cultivated virtue yet their Way did not prevail; some stored their talents yet the times did not guard them. Some waited for the Yellow River to run clear until their teeth had fallen out; some exhausted their loyalty and diligence yet were not known or employed. Their far-reaching influence did not extend to their age; their beneficent deeds did not reach the people. Treasures fit for the banquet mat lay mired in mud; talents for aiding the world ended without application. Like the man who played the zither yet did not meet King Wu Ding, or the one who held the fishing pole yet did not encounter King Wen—from ancient times to the present, how many have there been? Yet to lament this alone is indeed narrow-minded.\n\nTo gaze upon the distant path and be ashamed to follow it, to know the great Dao is obstructed yet not change course, to equate success and failure on a single road, to consign honor and disgrace to nature—how could one harbor melancholy in the face of scarce understanding, or sigh forever at the passing of rivers? To suspect resentment in this is to fail to comprehend the mind of the perfected person.\n\nThe ignorance of short-lived creatures regarding the long-lived, the frog in the well’s incomprehension of the vast sea—these have always been so.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One**\nThe *Baopuzi* states: There was a man called Master Tranquil and Profound. Though his years were but those of one who studies the will, he had already exhaustively perused the Six Classics and broadly synthesized the *He* and *Luo* texts. By day, he contended with the last rays of Xi He; by night, he illuminated the lingering glow of Wang Shu. No Dao was too distant for him to fathom; no word was too obscure for him to plumb. He took Confucianism and Daoism as his city walls, his spiritual acuity as his weapons. Thus, those who discoursed could not but trail dust and proffer jade in his presence; scholars, upon setting eyes on him, laid down their brushes. Soon, they awoke to the wisdom of silence and realized the blamelessness of guarding the One. When his intent was fulfilled, he deemed the fish-trap and rabbit-snare discardable; when the Dao diverged, he perceived that lofty singing finds few harmonies.\n\nThereupon, he embraced Laozi’s caution against frequent defeat and pondered the admonition of the golden man’s triple-sealed lips. He sheathed his blade’s edge as if encasing it, polished his brush on the vermilion tube, held gold and jade within, and restrained his florid eloquence. From dawn to dusk, he might utter not a single word. His disciples approached and said: “Master, you remain silent—how can your disciples expound? You differ not from the common man.”\n\nI privately thought: If the great bell does not sound, it is no different from a heap of bronze; if the floating chime ceases its tone, it is indistinguishable from a pile of stones.\n\nMaster Tranquil and Profound replied: “I seek only to gather a distant name across ten thousand generations and find a true friend in the ages to come. How could I vie for recognition in this day or set my standard in this moment? A vessel for brewing fine wine, though excellent, does not itself become drunk. One who speaks humbly yet loftily, though correct, is not believed. To curl the tongue and exhaust the voice—what remedy is there for fleeing and evasion? The ancients laughed at fifty-nine when they reached sixty; only then did they realize the depth of their past delusion.\n\nFor jade is hard, and gold is strong.”\n\nThe cold of ice and the heat of fire—do they require self-proclamation to be known? Moreover, the eight tones and nine suites cannot avoid flaws of length or brevity; even Yang You’s hundred shots cannot prevent an occasional miss. Those who cross rivers without boats often drown in water; those fond of heated debate frequently slip in speech. Bo Ya was cautious with his strings, thus avoiding the burden of tangled fingers; the scholar guards his words, thus escaping the shame of careless slips. The shallow and vulgar act otherwise: they dispute the urgency of emptiness and nothingness, squander words on trivial matters, and expound at length on the useless doctrines of \"hard and white.\" They litigate against the masters, condemn the sages, and fault the upright, calling such misguidance \"profound.\" They cast aside the true classics to vie in heterodox studies, or match wits with the ignorant in contests of lip and tongue, spouting lofty discourse to those who cannot comprehend. Before those who cannot contend, with no discerning audience at hand, how is this different from playing refined music beside wooden effigies or displaying alchemical elixirs before clay idols?\n\nIn vain their mouths grow parched, their qi exhausted, their bold gestures like axes dulled and splintered—yet the knot remains unbroken. Their faces flush with agitation, their discord grows ever more distant, until anger distorts their countenance, shameful words escape their lips, and the shift toward pettiness arises. Once such flaws are stained, they cannot be mended. Far better to embrace silence to preserve the great tone, to restrain speech and await those who truly understand.\n\n*Self-Narration, Fifty-First*\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity, surnamed Ge, named Hong, styled Zhichuan, was a native of Jurong in Danyang. His ancestors descended from the Ge Tian clan, who once ruled all under heaven in ancient times. Later, they were demoted to the ranks of feudal lords and took Ge as their surname. Hong’s great-grandfather served as Inspector of Jingzhou. When Wang Mang usurped the throne, he scorned to serve a traitorous regime, resigned his post, and returned home. Together with Zhai Yi, Governor of Dongjun, he raised troops to punish Wang Mang but was defeated. Pardoned and spared from disaster, he feigned illness and withdrew from the world. Fearing that the Ge clan’s strength might eventually provoke unrest, Wang Mang relocated them to Langye. Hong’s grandfather, Pu, raised an army to aid Emperor Guangwu, rendering great service. After Guangwu ascended the throne, Pu was appointed General of Chariots and Cavalry, later promoted to General of Agile Cavalry, and enfeoffed as Marquis of Xiapei and Tongxian, with a fief of five thousand households. At the founding of the dynasty, Pu’s younger brother, Wen, followed the marquis on campaigns and achieved repeated victories. The marquis repeatedly memorialized the throne to commend Wen’s merits, but the court, citing Wen’s private service under his elder cousin without official military rank, refused to acknowledge his contributions. The marquis declared, “My brother and I together faced arrows and stones, our bodies covered in wounds, my right eye lost—yet he has received no reward, while I am laden with gold and purple. How can my heart be at ease?” He then petitioned to transfer his own enfeoffment to his brother. The emperor, wishing to honor the marquis’s noble integrity, granted the request. Wen, though reluctant, accepted the title and immediately ceded his residence to become the encampment of the General of Agile Cavalry, establishing his estate in Bowang Ward. To this day, its foundations and stone pillars remain. He also divided his stipends to provide for his officers and soldiers, treating them as generously as the two former marquises. The General of Agile Cavalry repeatedly urged him to desist, but Wen refused, saying, “This only burdens the people further. How can I accept?” Feigning other business, he crossed the Yangtze southward and settled in Jurong, where his descendants tilled the land and found solace in books. Though Wen repeatedly sent envoys to welcome the General of Agile Cavalry, the latter never returned. Instead, he stationed guards to maintain the estate in Bowang, hoping for the general’s eventual return—yet for generations, no one resided there.\n\nHong’s grandfather was a scholar of unparalleled breadth, mastering all fields of learning with profound precision. His literary and artistic attainments stood peerless in his time, and he possessed the talent to govern a state. Serving the Kingdom of Wu, he held successive posts as Magistrate of Haiyan, Lin’an, and Shanyin, then entered the capital as Gentleman of the Ministry of Personnel, Palace Aide to the Censor-in-Chief, Governor of Luling, Minister of Personnel, Junior Preceptor to the Crown Prince, President of the Imperial Secretariat, Grand Master of Ceremonies, Palace Attendant, and Intendant of the Palace Guards. He was also appointed General of Assisting Wu and enfeoffed as Marquis of Wushou. Hong’s father was renowned for his filial piety and fraternal devotion, a model for scholars. His conduct and learning were exhaustively recorded in official histories. He served Wu as Gentleman of the Five Offices, Prefect of Jiancheng and Nanchang, Gentleman of the Imperial Secretariat, and Minister of Justice, then as General of the Guards. He was appointed Governor of Kuaiji but had not yet assumed office when the Jin army advanced downstream, and the western borders collapsed. Recognizing his literary and martial talents, the court and populace unanimously recommended him. He was thus transferred to serve as Commander-in-Chief of Five Commanderies, charged with defending the frontier, granted five thousand personal troops, and placed in command of all expeditionary forces. Yet when heaven decrees ruin, human effort cannot prevail. As the former lord submitted to the Nine Provinces’ shared fate, Hong’s father, retaining his former rank, was summoned to serve as Gentleman of the Palace, gradually rising to the position of Grand Master of Splendid Happiness. He later served as Magistrate of Feixiang, a county of twenty thousand households, where his governance was deemed the finest in the province. His moral transformation was exceptional, his benevolence pervasive, his punishments just, and his domain peaceful, earning him widespread praise. Roads were free of bandits, and no one tilled public fields or crossed boundaries to trade. Even the smallest gifts were refused at his gate, while paper and brushes were supplied from his private funds. Through punishments, order was maintained; without words, transformation was achieved. He resigned due to illness, but an imperial edict summoned him to serve as Prefect of Wu, where he upheld strict integrity, correcting errors, promoting the worthy, and exposing the corrupt. The state and military were governed with solemn harmony. Later, he was appointed Governor of Shaoling and died in office.\n\nHong was his father’s third son. Born late in his parents’ lives, he was doted upon and not strictly disciplined in books and history. At the age of thirteen, he lost his kind father, prematurely deprived of paternal instruction. Struggling with hunger and cold, he personally tilled the fields, laboring beneath the stars and treading upon frost, diligently following the plow. Repeatedly ravaged by war and fire, his family’s books were utterly destroyed. During rare moments of respite from farming, with nothing to read, he carried his satchel and walked to borrow books, only to find that few households possessed complete collections. Thus, he redoubled his efforts, cutting and selling firewood to purchase paper and brushes, writing books by the light of kindling in his thatched hut. For this reason, he could not early immerse himself in the arts and literature. Often lacking paper, he wrote on the same sheets repeatedly, rendering his texts barely legible. At sixteen, he began studying the *Classic of Filial Piety*, the *Analects*, the *Book of Songs*, and the *Book of Changes*. Yet poverty prevented him from seeking distant teachers and friends, leaving him isolated and poorly informed, his thoughts shallow and his understanding limited. Many great principles remained beyond his grasp. Eager to read widely, he devoured all manner of books, memorizing whatever he encountered. Yet his nature was dull and forgetful, his will not steadfast, and his retention weak. Though he sometimes drew upon his readings in his writings, he never achieved the depth of a true Confucian scholar and was unfit to serve as a teacher. The *River Chart* and *Luo Writing*, along with apocryphal texts, he merely glanced at without deep engagement. He disliked astrological manuals, calculations, the Nine Palaces, three-player chess, *Taiyi* divination, and flying talismans, finding no affinity for such arts. Later, he dabbled in wind angles, qi observation, the Three Origins, *Dunjia*, *Liuren*, and *Taiyi* methods, gaining only a rough understanding without deep study. He concluded that such practices were tools for others’ use, mere distractions from self-cultivation. Believing that reducing desires was more beneficial, he abandoned them. According to the *Separate Record of Arts and Letters*, there were 13,299 volumes of books, and since the Wei dynasty, the corpus had doubled. Thus, he realized how much he had yet to see. Books from the south of the Yangtze were incomplete, and he once journeyed to the capital in search of rare and extraordinary texts, only to be thwarted by great chaos, forcing him to turn back midway. Each time, he sighed with regret. Now nearing forty, his youthful aspirations have waned. He thinks only of diminishing desires further, practicing non-action, and perhaps retiring to the marshes to preserve his life. His pursuit of broad learning has thus daily declined.\n\nGe Hong was a man of simple and rustic bearing, dull by nature, slow of speech, and plain in appearance, yet he never sought to adorn or refine himself. His hats and shoes were filthy and worn, his robes often tattered, and he felt no shame in this. As worldly fashions swiftly changed—now broad collars and wide sashes, now tight sleeves and long hems, now trailing skirts, now garments too short to cover the feet—he remained steadfast in his ways, refusing to follow the shifts of the age. His words were always plain and truthful, free of jest or mockery. When no suitable companion was at hand, he would pass the entire day in silence. Thus, all who knew him called him a man who \"embraced simplicity,\" and so he took this as the title for his writings.\n\nBy nature, Ge Hong was frail and sickly, and poverty left him without carriage or horse. He could not bear to walk, nor did he enjoy it, and he despised the degenerate customs of his time—how men abandoned fundamentals to chase trivialities, how they overindulged in socializing. Thus, he took up his brush in seclusion, dwelling in stillness behind a wattle gate, with no place to rush to or follow after. Even those in power, though near at hand, scarcely knew him. His clothes could not ward off the cold, his roof could not keep out the rain, and his food could not fill his stomach. Yet fame never crossed his threshold, and he could not bring himself to care. Poor, with no servants, his fences collapsed, brambles choked his courtyard, and weeds overran his steps. When he ventured out, he pushed through thickets; when he returned, he brushed past overgrowth. Observers thought him lofty of mind, neglectful of the mundane, and never resentful of his hardships.\n\nUnskilled in formal visits, he never paid respects to officials. Yet when it came to mourning the dead or tending to the sick, he would force himself to go, sparing no effort. But his frailty and frequent illnesses often left him unable to fulfill these duties, and critics would reproach him. Ge Hong accepted the blame without concern. He thought: if his intentions were pure and illness alone prevented him, why should he feel shame? What reason had others not to understand? Only those of clear discernment would forgive him, recognizing that his embrace of simplicity was not a ploy to cultivate loftiness.\n\nMost men cherished the warmth of close bonds and prized the intimacy of those who came to them in ignorance. Ge Hong, however, believed that truly knowing another was no easy task—even the sages found it difficult. Superficial friendships, where words aligned but minds clashed, brought no benefit, only harm. Though he could not sever ties as abruptly as Zhuangzi’s friend did, he insisted on clarity and thorough understanding before committing to a relationship. For this, he was deeply resented, yet he never changed.\n\nThose who chased success and stood obsequiously at the gates of the powerful despised Ge Hong for his difference, slandering him as arrogant and dismissive of custom. But Ge Hong was a man of unwavering conviction; praise and blame alike fell on deaf ears. He loathed those who, relying on their own strengths, belittled the weaknesses of others. As one of the least among Confucians, when he spoke with others, he always gauged their understanding and discussed only what they could grasp, never forcing them toward what they could not comprehend.\n\nWhen debating with scholars, he would lay out the essentials. If he encountered someone of limited ability, he would offer only a rough sketch of his ideas, just enough to spark insight, without pressing the finer points to the point of confusion. Those who listened with a calm mind and pondered deeply often found their own realizations. When he judged someone unfit for discussion, even if questioned, he would plead ignorance to avoid wasting words.\n\nBy nature, Ge Hong deeply disliked imposing on officials or superiors. From youth to old age, he had secretly aided several friends in distress, yet none knew it was he who had helped them. He could not bear to see others wronged and would quietly intervene on their behalf. But for all others—even close relatives—if they held power or influence and were strangers to him, he would not trouble them with so much as a word or half a character.\n\nWhen his supplies ran low and he urgently needed medicine, he would ask friends for help, and if they provided, he accepted without refusal. Any assistance he received, he repaid gradually over time, ensuring the giver never noticed. If the aid did not come from a friend, he would not accept it. When his own provisions lasted ten days, he would share them to relieve others’ needs. But if his own stores were insufficient, he would not deprive himself.\n\nHe did not strive for petty displays of virtue or meticulous scruples. Among villagers, those deemed \"good and kind\" would sometimes bring wine and dishes to visit him. Though he did not consider them his equals, he did not refuse them. If he later repaid the gesture, he did not do so immediately.\n\nGe Hong once remarked on the historian’s account of a man who refused to eat with his brothers but kept his table spotless for guests: such was the false conduct of those seeking fame, not the magnanimity of a statesman. He particularly despised those without principle—men who neglected the fundamentals of farming and weaving to pursue illicit gains. Some sold official appointments for bribes; others exploited their influence to extort wealth. Some took bribes from criminals, others wronged the innocent. Some harbored fugitives and sheltered outlaws; others conscripted laborers to obstruct public works. Some hoarded goods to inflate prices; others monopolized markets to seize profits from the people. Some seized fields and robbed the weak of their livelihoods. They cowered before officials, seeking opportunities to exploit, then flaunted their gains before their wives and concubines or used them to buy fame and rank. With such men, Ge Hong refused all association.\n\nThus, the worldly despised him, and naturally, they kept their distance. No carriage tracks marred his lane, no guests of differing minds crossed his hall. His courtyard could have been set with bird nets, and his tables gathered dust. From the time he first gained understanding until his later years, his lips never uttered another’s faults, nor did he delight in others’ secrets—this came naturally to him. Even his servants, if they had shortcomings or shameful acts, he never mocked. He never judged or ranked people’s strengths and weaknesses, nor did he enjoy scolding others. If pressed by superiors to speak of someone’s likes or dislikes, he would only mention their finest qualities. When discussing writing, he would highlight its best aspects, never pointing out its flaws. Thus, he incurred no resentment for praise or blame.\n\nWhen powerful men occasionally asked him about officials or commoners—who was pure, who was capable—he would extol the virtues of the upright and talented. For the greedy, violent, or ignorant, he would claim to know nothing of them. For this, he was often criticized, accused of being overly cautious, unable to clearly distinguish right from wrong. Yet Ge Hong never altered his ways.\n\nHe often saw how people, when discussing others, would compare and rank them, their praise and criticism often misplaced. Those who were praised would take it as their due, though their virtue might not be genuine. Those who were slighted would hate their detractors to the bone, as if they were blood enemies. Ge Hong took this as a warning and thereafter never spoke of others.\n\nWhen engaging with scholars, he would grasp the main points. If he encountered someone of limited understanding, he would offer only a rough outline of his ideas, just enough to inspire insight, without pressing the finer points to the point of confusion. Those who listened with a calm mind and pondered deeply often found their own realizations. If he judged someone unfit for discussion, even if questioned, he would plead ignorance to avoid wasting words. His nature deeply disliked imposing on officials or superiors. From youth to old age, he had secretly aided several friends in distress, yet none knew it was he who had helped them. He could not bear to see others wronged and would quietly intervene. But for others—even close relatives—if they held power and were strangers to him, he would not trouble them with so much as a word.\n\nWhen his supplies ran low and he urgently needed medicine, he would ask friends for help, accepting without refusal. Any assistance he received, he repaid gradually, ensuring the giver never noticed. If the aid did not come from a friend, he would not accept it. When his provisions lasted ten days, he would share them to relieve others’ needs, but if his own stores were insufficient, he would not deprive himself. He did not strive for petty displays of virtue or meticulous scruples. Among villagers, those deemed \"good and kind\" would sometimes bring wine and dishes to visit him. Though he did not consider them his equals, he did not refuse them. If he later repaid the gesture, he did not do so immediately.\n\nThough his clan’s disciples and younger kin might deem such a stance too lenient, he would assign them both praise and blame without distinction. Some mocked him for this, to which he replied: “My person belongs to me. The principle should be easy to grasp. Suppose someone asked me to compare myself to the ancients or to my contemporaries, forcing me to rank myself—truly, I could not know with whom I might be matched. How much less should I presume to judge those who are not myself?\n\nIn the late Han, the corruption of custom gave rise to factions and cliques. Men like Xu Shao and his ilk wielded their tongues to issue warnings and engage in disputes, turning debates into feuds. Thus, the scholars of Runan had no fixed reputations, only the monthly evaluations of character. Even Emperor Wu of Wei deeply despised this and sought to behead them, driving them to flee in panic, nearly to the point of annihilation. The lesson lies close at hand—one may well take it as a teacher.\n\nMoreover, people are not easily known. Even fathers and elder brothers may not fully understand their sons and younger brothers. Is what aligns with me necessarily right? Is what differs from me necessarily wrong? Some begin well but end poorly. Yao, the Duke of Zhou, Confucius, and Jizha all lamented their own incompleteness. How can those of us with narrow, flickering candlelight vision presume to judge others and assess their worth? Do we surpass those sagely and virtuous ancients?\n\nDuring the Da’an era, Shi Bing rebelled, ravaging six provinces. Villages and towns were laid waste, and the righteous cause was overturned. The Grand Marshal of the Righteous Army summoned Hong to serve as a general and captain. Repeatedly pressed, and fearing deep calamity would befall his homeland, he recalled the ancient principle of aiding those in dire peril. Yet he also dreaded military discipline and dared not act on his own will. Thus, he recruited several hundred men and joined the army in its advance. Once, they attacked a separate rebel force and routed them. On that day, coins and silks piled like mountains, and treasures covered the ground. The other armies all released their soldiers to gather spoils, their carts and packs stretching end to end. Hong alone ordered his troops not to stray from formation. If any soldier was found looting, Hong immediately executed him as an example. Thus, none dared abandon their posts. Later, when hundreds of ambushers emerged to strike the other armies, those forces had scattered, their men and horses burdened with plunder, their fighting spirit gone. They fell into chaos, suffering heavy casualties, nearly beyond recovery. Only Hong’s troops remained orderly, their carts and tents undamaged, saving the other armies from total collapse. Hong’s merit was great in this.\n\nIn a later battle, he slew a minor rebel chieftain and captured many suits of armor and heads, presenting them as trophies to headquarters. The Grand Marshal then bestowed upon Hong the title of General Fubo, along with a gift of a hundred bolts of cloth, following standard practice. Many officers sealed their rewards or sent them home, but Hong distributed his among his officers and soldiers, as well as to impoverished acquaintances. Of the hundred bolts, he kept only ten for himself, then immediately used them to buy meat and wine to feast his officers and men. For a time, this became the talk of the day.\n\nWhen the conflict ended, Hong cast aside his weapons and armor and headed straight for Luoyang, seeking to expand his collection of rare books. He made no mention of his military achievements, secretly admiring the principle of Lu Lian, who refused gold from Liaocheng, and Wu Zixu, who declined rewards for preserving Chu—embracing the virtue of not dwelling on success.\n\nJust then, the capital fell into great turmoil, and the northern roads were blocked. Chen Min rebelled in Jiangdong, cutting off the return route. An old friend, Dong Ju, who had been appointed Governor of Guangzhou, submitted a memorial requesting Hong as his adjutant. Though the post was not to his liking, the south offered a refuge, so he reluctantly accepted. Sent ahead to muster troops, he waited for Dong Ju to follow, but Dong was killed en route. Hong thus remained in Guangzhou, frequently invited by regional commanders to serve, but he declined every offer.\n\nHe reflected: wealth and honor may be gradually attained but cannot be seized all at once. The pursuit of such things is wearisome and enough to exhaust a person. Moreover, glory and power are like lodgers—neither permanent nor something one can cling to. What rises high will inevitably fall; what blazes bright will fade. Like spring blossoms, they must wither. To rejoice in gaining them or grieve in losing them is to invite endless regret, sorrow, and fear—struggles too numerous to name. They are not worth the trouble.\n\nAssessing his own nature, he found it deeply indolent, his talents severely limited. Even if he were to bow and scrape, rushing about in the dust, he would surely fail to achieve great fame or avoid entanglements—how much more so given his inability? Better to cultivate the Way of Master Red Pine and Wang Qiao, which lies within oneself and does not depend on others.\n\nHe aspired to ascend famous mountains, practice dietary arts, and nurture his nature—not out of neglect for worldly affairs, but because one cannot serve both at once. If he did not abandon worldly duties, how could he cultivate tranquility and the profound?\n\nMoreover, true understanding is difficult and cannot be borrowed through inquiry or discussion. Thus, his carriage and horses never entered the domains of the powerful, and not a single word of his writing was exchanged with those in office. Though he could not entirely withdraw from the scholar’s circle, he refused to receive visitors. When others’ works infringed upon his own, he could not maintain his focus. He sighed: “There is no Dao in the mountains and forests.” Yet the ancients who cultivated the Dao invariably entered the mountains and forests, truly seeking to distance themselves from clamor and prevent their minds from being disturbed.\n\nNow, he would fulfill his original aspiration: leaving his homeland, he would journey to Mount Song to seek the path of Fangping and Liang Gong. His earlier work, the *Master’s Book*, in both inner and outer chapters, had fortunately already been completed. He would now compile and arrange it to show to future generations.\n\nAt fifteen or sixteen, he had written poems, rhapsodies, and miscellaneous essays, which he then believed were passable. By the time he reached twenty, he reviewed them again and found much unsatisfactory. His talent had not necessarily improved—only his reading had broadened, and he now discerned the difference between the refined and the coarse. Thus, he discarded most of his earlier work, keeping less than one-tenth. Excluding the *Master’s Book*, he still had over a hundred scrolls of miscellaneous writings, though many remained unrevised, filled with sorrow and indignation, and he lacked the leisure to refine them further.\n\nOthers wrote swiftly, finding satisfaction in their work as soon as it was done. But his own talent was dull, his thoughts slow, and he could not produce polished prose on demand. Each time he revised a character, the text improved, but his laziness and the volume of his work prevented frequent review.\n\nIn his twenties, he had calculated that writing minor, trivial pieces wasted time better spent establishing a coherent philosophy. Thus, he began drafting the *Master’s Book*. However, war and upheaval scattered him, and some works were lost. For over a decade on the road, he did not take up his brush. Only in the Jianwu era did he finally settle, completing twenty inner chapters and fifty outer chapters, along with a hundred scrolls of stele inscriptions, eulogies, poems, and rhapsodies. He also wrote thirty scrolls of military documents, proclamations, letters, and memorials. Additionally, he compiled works not included in common catalogs: the *Biographies of Divine Immortals* in ten scrolls, the *Biographies of Recluses* in ten scrolls, and an anthology of essential passages from the Five Classics, the Seven Histories, the Hundred Schools, military affairs, techniques, and miscellaneous wonders, totaling three hundred and ten scrolls, each with its own catalog.\n\nThe inner chapters discuss matters of Daoist concern: divine immortals, elixirs, strange transformations, life-nourishing practices, longevity techniques, and methods to ward off misfortune. The outer chapters address Confucian themes: human successes and failures, and the right and wrong of worldly affairs.\n\nHong noted that Emperor Wen of Wei’s *Canon of Classics* omitted mention of games like tanqi and swordplay. He intended to briefly record what he knew, but in truth, his skills were few and minor, and he could not boast falsely. Now, he would fully describe what he had not yet mastered.\n\nGe Hong’s nature was dull and his talents mediocre. From the time his hair was first tied up in childhood, he lagged behind other boys in tossing tiles or wrestling. He never fought cocks, raced dogs or horses, and when he saw others gambling, he paid no heed. Even when dragged along to watch, he remained utterly disengaged, as if dozing in broad daylight. To this day, he does not know how many lines are on a chessboard or the names of the dice in *chupu*. He considers such pastimes trivial arts that scatter the mind and waste time. For officials, they harm governance; for scholars, they disrupt recitation; for commoners, they cause neglect of farming; for merchants, they lead to loss of goods. Before the outcome is decided, players grow heated in dispute, their faces flushed with anger, calling this \"amusement\" when in truth it is torment. It erodes integrity, sparks contention, invites heavy wagers, and breeds hidden grudges. In the past, Duke Min of Song and the Crown Prince of Wu met with fatal disasters, while the rebellion of the Seven States nearly toppled the imperial court—lessons bright as mirrors for a hundred generations. Whenever he observed players, he saw them flushed with shame and rage, striking out with hands and feet, hurling insults, severing friendships, and breaking ties—all too common. Resentment does not depend on scale; whether great or small, it often brings regret. Such pursuits are not worth the trouble.\n\nConfucius warned against dozing in the daytime, but compared to Ge Hong, even that seems preferable. Daytime dozing is merely unproductive, whereas it does not risk resentment or litigation. The sage still wore out bamboo strips three times in his devotion to the classics—how could an ordinary man of modest talent manage both? All such games are inferior to even a foot of books. Thus, he naturally disliked them and never engaged, though such pastimes are dear to the common crowd.\n\nIn his youth, he once studied archery, but his strength was insufficient to draw a strong bow—only one like Yan Gao’s. He believed archery was among the Six Arts and could be used to repel bandits, resist raids, and hunt birds and beasts, so he practiced it. Once, while in the military, he shot at pursuing cavalry, striking down two enemies and a horse, thereby escaping death. He also learned the use of the shield and single- and double-edged swords, all with oral formulas and essential techniques for subduing opponents. There were even secret methods so skillful they seemed divine. When facing the untrained, he could single-handedly prevail, advancing without hindrance.\n\nLater, he learned the seven-foot staff technique, which could be used to disarm opponents or break through defenses. Yet this, too, was a non-essential skill—knowing it was like possessing the horn of a qilin or the spur of a phoenix: what need was there for it? Few in his time understood such things.\n\nFrom a young age, Ge Hong had a steadfast resolve never to enter officialdom. Whenever he read the biographies of Chao Fu, Xu You, the northern recluse of Zizhou, the two Jiangs of Shihu, the two Xiaos, Fazhen, and Zilong, he would set aside his books and lean forward in admiration. He aspired to master the Five Classics and compose a work of his own, so that later generations would know him as a literary scholar. Later, when the prefecture and the General of Chariots and Cavalry summoned him, he declined. Though recommended to the prime minister’s office of the Prince of Langye, when the uprising began and the rebels were pacified, he did not seek recognition or visit the office to claim merit. The officials in charge never rewarded his contributions.\n\nHe hoped that the King of Jin, who answered Heaven’s call and followed the people’s will, would restore order, revive the fading imperial lineage, repair the neglected ancestral temples, and honor the unrecognized merits of the previous dynasty to encourage future service. Ge Hong followed the general amnesty and, in the year *gengyin*, received an edict granting him the title of Marquis of Guanzhong, with a fief of two hundred households in Jurong. He had secretly led troops to suppress rebels and save his homeland, but his efforts were deemed insufficient for record. The honor of golden and purple seals was not his original aspiration. He had wished to emulate Lu Lian from afar and Tian Chou more closely, submitting petitions to decline and fulfill his reclusive ambitions. However, a general amnesty was in place, and his request was not granted.\n\nIn the past, Zhong You declined a reward he was due, yet this discouraged others from doing good. The barbarians had not yet been pacified, the realm was troubled, and the state sought to clarify rewards and punishments to uphold the law. How could a humble man like himself stubbornly cling to his timid resolve and resist the grand, all-encompassing system? Thus, he set aside his personal inclinations and respectfully accepted the imperial decree.\n\nAfter Ge Hong wrote his autobiographical essay, someone challenged him, saying: \"In his later years, Wang Chong feared his name and deeds would perish, so he wrote an account of himself. You, however, are in the prime of life, living in an era of sagely rule. You should be untying the silk bundles of Shen Gong and mounting the rush mats of Mei Sheng, illuminating the Nine Five with your brilliance and surpassing the fame of Kunwu. Why instead pursue the path of an old scholar, wasting your fragrance?\"\n\nGe Hong replied: \"Heaven and Earth stretch vast, yet man dwells as if in a borrowed abode. The morning mushroom’s brief bloom withers before the day is done; the spring flower’s glory fades within ten days. Even the fleeting flight of the whirlwind or the sudden flash of lightning are not necessarily swifter. The span of a hundred years is like a shooting star’s swift passage; gray hair flies by like an arrow through a gap. How much more so for those who wither in summer’s heat or perish before autumn’s chill? Thus, Xiangzi lamented the unharvested grain, and Yang Xiong mourned his early death.\n\n\"Looking back through the ages, extraordinary men have risen like dragons through literary arts or crouched like tigers through martial deeds. Their great merits are recorded in the bright halls, their virtuous reputations echoing through the bamboo and silk. Though their forms may decay in the earth, their fine reputations soar with the days. Even after a thousand or ten thousand generations, they remain revered.\n\n\"I, however, am mediocre and obscure, my steps out of sync with the times, my voice discordant with the world. My steps clash with the crowd, and within, I lack the support of the Jin or Zhang families; without, I have no friends to dust off their hats for me. Though the path may be smooth, my feet are not those of a *qilin*; though the skies may be vast, my wings are not those of the great peng. Above, I cannot soar like a hawk to aid the state; below, I cannot glorify my parents or leave behind a name. My virtues are not entrusted to good historians, nor is my fame inscribed on bells and tripods. Thus, in the margins of my writings, I have composed this autobiographical essay. Though it may not alter my fate, I rely on future generations to carry on the record.\"\n\n*Baopuzi, Outer Chapters, Scroll Four*",

      "translated_text": "From the *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*, *Baopuzi Inner Chapters*, Scroll Two, by Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty, \"Resolving Difficulties,\" Chapter Seven\n\nSomeone asked: The august heavens are supremely divine, bestowing fate with perfect impartiality—why then do pine and cypress, mere commoners, receive the gift of deathless longevity, while the great sages Zhou and Kong enjoy no enduring span of life?\n\nBaopuzi replied: The length or brevity of life is truly determined by the celestial configurations one encounters at the moment of conception, when qi coalesces and the embryo forms. The Dao of Heaven acts without deliberate action, allowing things to follow their natural course—it shows no partiality, no favor, no distinction between this and that. If one’s fate is bound to the star of life, that person will inevitably be drawn to the Dao of immortality; those drawn to the Dao of immortality will, if they seek it, surely attain it. If one’s fate is bound to the star of death, that person will not believe in the Dao of immortality and will not cultivate its practices. Whether one delights in goodness or not is decided by what one is endowed with; alteration, bestowal, or deprivation are not within Heaven’s power. It is like gold and iron being smelted in the furnace or pottery and tiles being shaped in the kiln: though the furnace and kiln bring them into form, the sharpness or dullness of tools, the uprightness or crookedness of jars, depend on what they encounter—this is no longer the work of the furnace or kiln.\n\nThe questioner objected: All that a skilled craftsman creates comes from his own hands. How can the divine intelligence of Heaven be incapable of anything? Yet you claim that human lives each encounter their own configurations, and are not shaped by the vast azure. This I find deeply perplexing—I cannot assent to it.\n\nBaopuzi answered: When the primordial chaos split and the clear and turbid separated, some rose and moved, others descended and stilled—even Heaven and Earth do not know why this is so. The myriad things respond to qi, each following its own nature, and together with Heaven and Earth, each becomes a distinct entity. The only difference lies in their sequence of formation and the scale of their bodies. Because Heaven and Earth are vast, we perceive the myriad things as small; because the myriad things are small, we perceive Heaven and Earth as vast. Moreover, though the abdomen and back enclose the five viscera, they do not create them; though skin and flesh envelop blood and qi, they do not produce them. Though Heaven and Earth contain the myriad things, they do not bring them into being. It is like grasses and trees relying on mountains and forests to sprout and flourish, yet the mountains and forests do not act upon them; fish and turtles depending on lakes and marshes to propagate, yet the lakes and marshes do not intervene. The common folk, seeing the vastness of Heaven and Earth and the smallness of the myriad things, say that Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things, and the myriad things are their descendants. Yet the lice born upon me—did I create them? Thus, though lice cannot arise without me, I am not their parent, nor are they my descendants. Gnats breed in vinegar, lingzhi and glutinous rice grow on trees and rocks, beetles thrive in filth and sludge, and emerald vines flourish on pine branches—none of these four are crafted by those things. The myriad things teem within Heaven and Earth—how is this different?",

      "translated_text": "Behold! Heaven possesses the sun and moon, the cycles of cold and heat; man possesses sight and hearing, breath and movement. By drawing distant analogies and extending near observations, one infers from this to that. Man cannot comprehend his own body—why he ages or grows young, why he feels pain or itches—just as Heaven cannot comprehend its own body, the reasons for its waxing and waning, its calamities and auspices. Man cannot ensure his ears and eyes remain ever sharp, his nourishing and defending *qi* unceasing; thus, Heaven cannot ensure the sun and moon avoid eclipses or the four seasons maintain their order. From this reasoning, matters of premature death or longevity truly do not lie with Heaven and Earth, nor are the secrets of immortality their doing.\n\nThat which gives me life is my father; that which bears me is my mother. Yet even they cannot guarantee my form will be perfectly proportioned, my countenance fair and lovely, my nature and principles balanced and harmonious, my wisdom lofty and far-reaching. They cannot multiply my strength, prolong my years, or extend my lifespan. Instead, some are stunted and frail, some dark and ugly; some are deaf, blind, stubborn, or perverse; some are crippled, toiling, or lame. What they obtain is not what they desire; what they desire is not what they obtain. How much less can Heaven and Earth, so vast and distant, achieve this? Even parents are far removed—how can I, possessing this body, ensure it remains forever robust and unaging, perpetually healthy and free from illness, its joy and anger never misplaced, its plans and reflections without regret or remorse? Thus, those who bestow *qi* and shape form are my parents; those who receive and possess them are my own body. Beyond these, nothing is more intimately connected, nothing exerts greater control. If even these two cannot alter or benefit me, how can Heaven and Earth claim any part in it?\n\nIf all beings were truly the creations of Heaven and Earth, they should all be good without evil, complete without flaw, and all living things should fulfill their destinies without the sorrow of spring’s fading or autumn’s decay. Yet Heaven cannot grant Confucius or Mencius the blessing of transcending the world, proving that what they received was natural, not apportioned by Heaven and Earth. Sagehood is the pinnacle of virtue; if Heaven could bestow such perfect virtue, why would it not allow their desires to be fully realized, their achievements established, their positions supreme, their lifespans exceeding a century? This is no proof of Heaven’s deliberate action. The death of a sage is not Heaven’s killing, just as the birth of a sage is not Heaven’s creation. The worthy are not necessarily long-lived, nor are the foolish doomed to die young; goodness does not always bring fortune, nor does evil always invite disaster. Birth has no fixed term, death no constant measure. Men of towering virtue and wisdom may wither unfulfilled, while the mediocre Dou Gong lived to two hundred; Bo Niu was stricken with illness, Zixia lost his sight; the villainous Robber Zhi lived to a white-haired old age, while the wicked Zhuang Qiao sported a head of yellow hair. In this, Heaven’s non-action is manifest.\n\nSome say, Confucius declared, \"Since ancient times, all must die,\" while Laozi spoke of the learnability of divine transcendence. The words of sages are trustworthy and verifiable, but the teachings of Daoists are fanciful and difficult to apply. The *Baopuzi* states: Confucius is the sage of the Confucians, Laozi the sage of the Dao. Confucian teachings are near and easy to perceive, hence many follow them; the intent of the Dao is distant and hard to grasp, hence few attain it. The Dao is the source of the ten thousand differences; Confucianism is but a stream of the great purity. Before the Three Sovereigns, the Dao governed; since the rise of emperors and kings, Confucianism has prevailed. Discussants all know to esteem the simplicity of high antiquity and disdain the decadence of later ages—why then do they revere Confucius while belittling Laozi? This is like admiring the blossoms at the tips of branches while failing to recognize the root from which they grow. How is this different from prizing luminous pearls while despising the deep pools, cherishing the *He* jade while loathing Mount Jing? They do not know that the deep pools are the source of luminous pearls, and Mount Jing the origin of the *He* jade.\n\nMoreover, nurturing one’s nature is but a remnant of the Dao; ordering the world is but a minor aspect of Confucianism.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the value of Confucianism lies in its power to transform customs and reform manners—not merely in its rites of bowing and yielding or its measured steps. The reverence for the Dao rests in its silent transformation, its influence extending far beyond the single matter of nurturing life.\n\nIf Confucianism and the Dao truly had an order of precedence, then Confucius could not be exclusively trusted, nor could Laozi be employed in isolation. Confucius himself paid respectful homage to Boyang, wishing to be compared to Lao Peng, and admitted that while he understood the ways of fish and birds, he did not comprehend the dragon—a metaphor by which he acknowledged Laozi as the dragon, an expression of heartfelt admiration, not empty words. This is no different from his words to Yan Hui: *\"Gazing at it, it appears ahead; suddenly, it is behind. Boring into it, it grows ever harder; looking up to it, it grows ever higher.\"*\n\nSome ask: *\"Confucius personally met Laozi yet did not follow his teachings—why?\"* The *Baopuzi* replies: *\"This makes it all the clearer that what one is endowed with is a mandate of nature, and what one esteems is an unchanging disposition. Confucius recognized the profound subtlety of Laozi’s teachings and valued their rarity, yet he could not draw from the wellspring of pure emptiness at its source. The Great Ancestor emerges beyond form and enters within the Perfect Dao. What he sought to learn was confined to matters of the common world—how could he have entreated the methods of immortality? His heart was wholly absorbed in teaching and transformation, with no thought for esoteric arts. Though sagely in worldly affairs, Confucius was not one to abide in stillness, profound silence, self-preservation, or non-action. Thus, Laozi admonished him: *'A good merchant hides his treasures as if empty; a noble man of great virtue appears foolish. Shed your pride, your excess of desires, your overbearing demeanor, your reckless ambitions—these bring no benefit to your person.'* From this, we may know that Confucius was not free from worldly attachments and was no practitioner of immortality’s Way.\n\nEver restless, ever anxious, his sole concern was to set the age aright—lamenting the phoenix’s silence above, sighing over the gourd’s unsold fate below. How could one so impassioned in his desire to wield the whip of governance abandon the work of ordering the world to pursue the roundabout path of nurturing life?\"\n\nSome ask: *\"Between the endeavors of Confucianism and the Dao, which is more difficult, which easier?\"* The *Baopuzi* answers: *\"Confucianism is difficulty within ease; the Dao is ease within difficulty. To renounce social ties, forsake wife and children, reject fame and honor, forgo profit and rank, turn from the dazzling before one’s eyes, and silence the clamor in one’s ears—to remain serene and withdrawn, content in solitude, guarding one’s integrity, unmoved by slander, unelated by praise, indifferent to high station, unashamed of lowly estate—this is the difficulty of the Dao. Yet one need not attend to condolences or visits, bear no burden of care for others, exhaust neither mind in the Seven Classics nor thought in calculations and calendrics, suffer no toil of astrological reckoning, nor servitude to literary arts. Freed from the weight of worldly burdens, harmony naturally flourishes; in non-action and non-concern, one knows no fear or dread—this is the ease of the Dao. Thus, it is ease within difficulty.\n\nThe Confucian, by contrast, follows established laws and models, his conduct governed by rules, his speech and silence timed to the moment, his teachers found in every household, his books clarified by commentaries and annotations—this is the ease of Confucianism. Yet to probe the profound and reach the distant, to weave together the ancient canons, to master the *He* and *Luo* texts, to encompass the vast learning of the Hundred Schools, to cultivate virtue in humble lanes, to devote one’s resolve to serving the ruler, to strain one’s spirit toward celestial patterns, to apply one’s thought to wind and clouds—if one matter remains unknown, one’s work is incomplete; if a single word is amiss, praise and blame are misapplied. Every step becomes a model for the world; every utterance is transmitted across the land—this is the difficulty of Confucianism. Thus, it is difficulty within ease.\n\nWeighing the two, the Confucian path is largely difficult, while the Daoist way is succinct and easy. I have already suffered its difficulties—why not abandon it and follow what is easy? Yet those who mock me in this world are as numerous as shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, while those who share my aspirations remain unseen. If like-minded souls exist, they must belong to a future age—for I do not consider them rare.\n\nSome say: *'Among the eminent scholars and erudite masters I have encountered—those who have plumbed principles to their depths, exhausted the nature of things, and scrutinized the boundaries of being and non-being—many have there been. Yet none have spoken of extending life or attaining immortality. Though your brilliance may rival the sun and moon, and your thoughts surpass ten thousand men, you suddenly discourse on the Way of long life—how can I believe it?'* The *Baopuzi* replies: *'Am I a man of mediocre talent, shallow insight, and scant learning, who would dare claim unique understanding surpassing all others? Yet have I not sought what is manifest and found it in the obscure? Have I not obtained with ease what others deem difficult?'* \"",

They judge human affairs by what is near and easily discerned, and when confronted with the vulgar delusions of the multitude, they claim: *\"What others doubt, I alone can decide; what has not yet shown its first signs, I can foresee.\"* Thus, they believe they have exhausted the nature of all things, penetrated all that is hidden and obscure, and obtained all that can be known. If I say there are no immortals, then immortals must not exist—so firmly entrenched is this conviction.\n\nI have often observed mediocre scholars who stubbornly reject and disbelieve in such matters. Their failing lies in possessing some intelligence yet being crippled by partiality and constraint, shackled by their own limitations, unwilling to consider what lies beyond. They are utterly benighted, unable to distinguish beans from wheat.

      "translated_text": "Those who observe form place unwavering trust in their own eyes—yet when what they hear and see is affirmed as true but proves false, are their ears and eyes truly beyond doubt? How much more so with the mind’s conjectures, which discern neither form nor sound, and whose obscurity far exceeds that of sight and hearing. To take what one’s own heart grasps as certain and then, on that basis, dismiss the most distant matters of the world—claiming that tales of divine transcendents are mere fabrications—is this not folly?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* says: Beauty and ugliness are fixed, yet love and hatred arise from differing sentiments, so the two eyes do not see for one another. The refined and the vulgar have long been distinct, yet likes and dislikes vary, so the two ears do not hear for one another. Truth and falsehood have their essence, yet inclinations and aversions clash, so the two hearts do not counsel one another. There are those who take the ugly for the beautiful, the turbid for the clear, the loss for the gain—these three divergences are glaringly evident, so plain to see. Yet even in such obvious cases, no unity of perception can be achieved. How much less, then, with the subtleties of divine transcendence, where expecting all to believe is without any plausible basis? If every person were made to understand, what value would there be in those of profound insight?\n\nTo wait for the common folk to cease their reckless talk is to wait for the Yellow River to run clear—it would not be long by comparison. My silence is not absolute; I hope only to guide those who may ascend or descend in understanding. As for the unyielding, even the ancients could do nothing with them.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* says: The difficulty of clarifying the highest truths and the skepticism toward divine transcendence are of long standing. [...] The rustic of Ma’s wilds, the ancient Duke, could not dissuade the Rong and Di from their desires—truth had its limits, and good words went unheeded. The *zhangfu* cap found no market among the Man and Yue; the red shoes were not worn by the Rong and Yi. How could one force them?

      "translated_text": "To see a dragon and call it a snake is not because the dragon lacks numinosity, but because only Cai Mo can distinguish it. The reason the Dao is prized is that it cannot be increased by addition nor diminished by subtraction. The reason virtue is prized is that one hears slander without gloom and sees praise without delight. Those who firmly believe the world has no immortals, while I alone contend that they truly exist—this dispute grows ever more protracted, and their obstinacy ever more entrenched. Is this not a futile prolongation of this endless strife, offering no remedy for their incomprehension? Should one truly follow the principle of the interlocking rings?\n\n*Releasing Doubts*, Chapter Eight\n\nSomeone asked: The ways of humanity are manifold, and seeking immortality is supremely difficult. If one does not abandon worldly affairs, how can one simultaneously attend to literary arts, the concerns of sorrow and joy, and the Way of ruler and minister?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replied: The Dao is not burdensome; what is rare is the few who act upon it. The only concern is whether one’s resolve is firmly established and one’s faith unwavering—why fear the neglect of human affairs? Those of great talent can cultivate both without difficulty. They inwardly treasure the Way of nurturing life and outwardly harmonize with the world. In governing the self, they achieve long cultivation; in governing the state, they bring great peace. They use the Six Classics to instruct the common people and transmit esoteric arts to those of like mind. If they wish to remain briefly, they stay to assist the times; if they wish to ascend, they soar into the clouds and lightly depart—these are the superior scholars. Those who rely on their own abilities but cannot achieve both may set aside worldly affairs and focus solely on cultivating the Dao—these are the next best. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor bore the burden of the Four Seas yet did not hinder his ascent at Mount Dinghu. Peng Zu served as a grandee for eight hundred years before traveling west to the Flowing Sands. Boyang was a chronicler, Maofeng a potter, Fang Hui a scholar, Lü Wang a grand preceptor, Qiu Sheng served in Yin, Ma Tui was an official in Jin, Lord Fan conquered Yue and sailed the seas, Qin Gao held a tablet in Song, Kang Changsheng humbled himself to hold the whip, and Duke Zhuang concealed his talents as a minor scribe. Many ancients attained the Dao while aiding the world, cultivating it in court and market—surely they had surplus energy. Why must one retreat to the mountains and forests, completely abandoning the affairs of the people, before achieving success?\n\nThere are also those whose hearts find peace in stillness, whose natures abhor clamor, who delight in freedom and loathe honor and office. They wear coarse ropes and tattered clothes, eat wild herbs, hold the plow, and enjoy their three joys. They abide by constancy, await their end, do not scheme for a fleeting life, and do not fear swift death. They decline appointments worth a thousand gold and scorn the nobility of high ministers. Even without cultivation, they are already like this—how much less would they be willing to serve the world if they were to add the supreme Dao to their practice? Each follows their own aspirations; one cannot generalize.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* said: The world says that a single good word is worth a thousand gold—yet this refers only to the gains and losses of state or the right and wrong of personal conduct. As for teaching others the secret of long life or transmitting the method of immortality, this is not merely a good word like those of ordinary people. How could it be worth only a thousand gold? If someone on the verge of death from illness could be saved and restored to health, none would fail to call it a profound kindness and a great favor. Now, if one follows the immortal classics and ingests the Nine Elixirs of liquid gold and jade, the entire world could be made immortal—its beneficence would not be merely the merit of saving one person. The virtue of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi is truly immeasurable, yet none recognize it, dismissing it as absurd and preposterous—how lamentable!\n\nThe *Baopuzi* said: To seek immortality, one must grasp its essentials. The essentials lie in treasuring essence, practicing qi, and ingesting the great elixir—this is sufficient, and no more is needed. Yet these three matters again have shallow and deep levels. Without a named teacher or enduring hardship, one cannot master them hastily. Though it is said to practice qi, there are several methods of doing so. Though it is said to practice the bedchamber arts, there are nearly a hundred techniques therein. Though it is said to ingest elixirs, there are roughly a thousand formulas for doing so. When first teaching others, one begins with the shallow. Only when their resolve is unwavering and their diligence evident does one reveal the deeper methods.\n\nThus, practicing qi can cure a hundred illnesses, enter epidemics, subdue tigers and snakes, stanch wounds and bleeding, allow one to dwell in water or walk upon it, ward off hunger and thirst, or extend lifespan. Its great essential is embryonic breathing. Those who attain embryonic breathing can refrain from exhaling and inhaling through the nose and mouth, as if within the womb—then the Dao is achieved. When first learning to practice qi, one draws qi through the nose and holds it, silently counting to one hundred twenty before gently exhaling through the mouth. Both inhalation and exhalation should be inaudible to oneself. One should always inhale more and exhale less. A test is to place a goose feather on the nose and mouth—if the feather does not move when exhaling, this is the sign. Gradually increase the count over time, and eventually one can reach a thousand. At a thousand, the old become young again, and one day’s practice reverses a day’s aging.\n\nOne should practice qi during the time of living qi, not during the time of dead qi. Thus it is said: \"The immortal ingests the six qi.\" In a day and night, there are twelve hours. From midnight to noon are the six hours of living qi; from noon to midnight are the six hours of dead qi. Practicing qi during dead qi is of no benefit. Those who use qi can exhale upon water, causing it to flow backward for several paces; exhale upon fire, causing it to extinguish; exhale upon tigers and wolves, causing them to crouch and be unable to move; exhale upon snakes and vipers, causing them to coil and be unable to depart. If another is wounded by blades or weapons, exhaling upon them stanches the blood. If one hears of someone struck by poison, even if unseen, one can exhale from afar, directing the breath—men exhale upon their left hand, women upon their right—and though the person may be a hundred miles away, they will immediately recover. For sudden afflictions or acute illnesses, merely swallowing the qi of three nines also brings instant relief. Yet human nature is often restless, and few can remain tranquil to cultivate this Way.\n\nMoreover, in practicing qi, one should not eat too much raw vegetables or rich, fresh foods, as they make the qi strong and difficult to contain. One must also refrain from anger, for much anger disorders the qi, preventing its overflow and sometimes causing coughing—thus few can succeed in this practice. My great-grandfather, the Immortal Duke, whenever deeply drunk or in the height of summer’s heat, would enter the depths of deep pools and remain for a day before emerging—this was precisely because he could close his breath and practice embryonic breathing.\n\nThe bedchamber arts comprise over ten schools: some repair injuries and damages, some attack and cure various illnesses, some gather yin to replenish yang, and some increase years and extend life. Their great essential lies in the single matter of returning essence to replenish the brain.",

      "translated_text": "This method is one passed down orally from one true adept to another, never committed to writing. Even if one consumes famous medicines yet remains ignorant of this essential teaching, one still cannot attain longevity. Moreover, one must not completely abstain from the union of yin and yang, for doing so leads to stagnation and obstruction, giving rise to pent-up resentment, loneliness, illness, and shortened life. Yet yielding to unbridled desire also diminishes one’s years and vitality. Only by attaining the harmony of regulated release can one avoid harm. Without the oral transmission of its techniques, not a single practitioner will fail to injure or even destroy themselves through this practice.\n\nThe likes of Xuansuzi, Rongchenggong, and Pengzu recorded only its coarse aspects, never committing its most essential teachings to paper. Those who aspire to immortality should diligently seek and practice it. I have recorded these words as I received them from my teacher, Master Zheng, to show future believers in the Dao—this is no groundless speculation. Yet I myself have not fully mastered its secrets.\n\nSome Daoist practitioners of one narrow path may wish to focus solely on the arts of sexual union in pursuit of immortality, neglecting the great medicine of golden elixir—this is utter folly. As the *Baopuzi* states, the Daoist texts that derive from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi are but a small fraction. Most are the work of later enthusiasts, each adding their own interpretations, so that the volumes now pile up like mountains. The ancients were simple and often lacked literary talent; their discussions of natural principles were incomplete, their evidence unclear. They concealed their essential teachings, making them difficult to understand, and even when explained, the explanations were not profound enough to fully expound their meaning, open the way for the frustrated, encourage the determined, instruct beginners, or reveal the subtle paths of the mysterious and wondrous, the sources of fortune and misfortune. Merely reciting these texts ten thousand times will yield nothing. Even if one seeks broad learning, one should carefully select the finest works and focus on them, for texts that do not convey the essential Way are not worth poring over.\n\nSome later learners fail to distinguish the depth of their authors. Taking anything labeled as Daoist teachings, they collect them indiscriminately until their boxes and baskets overflow, exhausting their minds in search of meaning—like seeking phoenix eggs in a swallow’s nest or trying to catch eels at the bottom of a well. No matter how diligent their efforts, they seek what cannot be found, gaining nothing of practical use. They waste their days and months in vain toil, reaping not even the slightest benefit. In public life, they fail in their duties; in private, they achieve no longevity. Thus, people inevitably point and say, “They practiced the Dao so diligently yet did not transcend the world—surely there is no method for avoiding death!” But they do not realize that such seekers of immortality are like those who stand by a river, admiring the fish but lacking a net—it is not that the water holds no fish.\n\nThe *Five Thousand Characters* may have come from Laozi, yet they are but general and cursory discussions. They never fully present a coherent method that can be verified. Merely reciting this scripture without grasping its essential Way is labor in vain—how much more so for those who fall short of even that?\n\nAs for Wenzi, Zhuangzi, Guanling Yinxin, and their like, though their florid writings trace back to the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, expounding the great principles of the mysterious and empty, they never reveal the ultimate teachings. Some even equate life and death, calling them no different, treating survival as forced labor and demise as rest—such views are already a thousand *li* removed from the path of immortality. How can they be worth indulging? Yet their allegories and parables may still offer some value for minor uses, filling gaps in times of need. Alas, that later generations of glib, unscrupulous, and immoral men have made Laozi and Zhuangzi their dens of refuge—is this not lamentable?\n\nSome may ask: “In an age ruled by a sagely and enlightened sovereign who treasures only the worthy, if those who study immortality refuse to enter office and instead cultivate the Dao, who will assist in governance?” The *Baopuzi* replies: To turn one’s back on a sagely ruler and dwell in the mountains was why Chaofu and Xu You were esteemed. To encounter a virtuous age and withdraw from the world was why Zhuang Bo was honored. The Yellow Emperor ruled all under heaven in perfect order, yet Guangchengzi did not serve him. Tang Yao governed the four seas in great peace, yet Woquan did not assist him. Yet neither the transformative power of their virtue nor the supply of talented men suffered for it.",

      "translated_text": "When Tang overthrew the Xia, Wu Guang bore a stone and cast himself into the river; when King Wu destroyed the Shang, Boyi and Shuqi refused to eat in the Western Mountains. When Duke Huan of Qi rose to power, Shao Ji reclined in a humble lane; when Wei Wen flourished, Gan Mu let his hair loose at his gate. The Four Elders withdrew to Shangluo, yet this did not hinder the great achievements of the Han; Zhou Dang stood aloof in the forests and marshes, yet this did no harm to the penal reforms of Emperor Wen. For such men, neither favor nor wealth could sway their hearts, nor could extreme riches alter their resolve. They washed their tassels in the Canglang’s waters, neither submitting nor suffering disgrace. They took fragrant groves as their pavilions, towering peaks as their mansions, emerald orchids as their cushions, green leaves as their curtains. They wore coarse cloth in place of court robes, ate wild greens instead of fine fare. Without tilling the soil themselves, they did not fill their bellies; without their wives’ weaving, they did not clothe their bodies. Such men have appeared from time to time over a thousand years—how much more so when they further abandon their kin to their clans, forsake their households without a glance, spurn glory as if it were dust, banish desire from their hearts, scale towering peaks alone, befriend echoes in the famed mountains, turn inward to the formless realm, and return to the utmost stillness? Within the eight directions, they guard against none, yet you fear the ruler will lack ministers—is this not excessive worry?\n\nSome may say: “Those who study immortality merely purify themselves while neglecting the great bonds of society; they turn their backs on the sovereign and display disloyal disrespect. I fear they will fail to achieve long life and instead incur punishment.” The *Baopuzi* replies: The northerners Shi Hu and Shan Juan, along with Zizhou, were all men of great talent, yet they lived in seclusion, roamed freely, and nurtured their vast integrity. Neither the grand transformations of the age nor the great Way suffered loss for it. How much less should those who study immortality necessarily possess the talent to govern or the usefulness to stand in court? Gaining them would not add even a drop of dew’s benefit; losing them would not cause the slightest harm. Today, the nine provinces are united, and even those from distant lands come to serve. The virtuous and capable are abundant, yet there are idle officials awaiting posts and long-serving ones sighing over delayed promotions. Those of high talent chafe under seniority constraints. The flourishing of worthy men is unmatched—how could the realm lack even a single commoner?\n\nIn former times, Prince Jin abandoned his duty to attend the royal meals and relinquished his position as heir apparent, yet King Ling did not reproach him for disloyalty. Yin Sheng resigned his official sash and departed from his post, yet the Zhou did not condemn him for disloyalty. Why? They truly understood that such men did not slight the world or despise the ruler; their aspirations simply differed from those of ordinary men and could not be altered. A ruler of the Dao harbors tolerance and forgiveness, knowing that human hearts cannot be the same and that each person’s path in life differs. He does not compel or forbid, thereby honoring and magnifying the highest principles. Above, he bears no grudging narrowness; below, he enjoys the utmost joy of those who follow their hearts. Thus, his radiant reputation shines in all directions, and even the greedy, hearing of it, feel shame.\n\nI have heard that when the balmy winds rise, fur robes and stoves are put away; when the world’s path is level, extraordinary men withdraw. Now that the ravages of war are settled, oxen are left to rest and horses released; beacon fires are extinguished, and the shadows of shields and spears are stilled. The mighty bows *Fanruo* and *Luque* are sheathed and cooked. Zhang Liang left the dark tent to return to the lanes; Xin Pi doffed his armor to take up fishing. How much more so for those who study immortality—of whom there is not even one in ten thousand—what harm could the state suffer in sparing them?\n\nYet their practice lies in few thoughts and scant desires; their work lies in preserving the body and prolonging life. They do not engage in the ugliness of competition nor bear the burden of offending custom—what crime is there in this? Moreover, the peaks of Hua and Heng are vast, the ocean’s expanse boundless. Their heights do not await the arrival of soaring dust; their depths do not rely on the inflow of rainwater. A handful of earth cannot diminish their loftiness; a ladle of water cannot lessen their breadth. In a generation, there are but a few immortals—how could they disrupt the world’s affairs?\n\nSome may say: “If the Dao of immortality can truly be sought and attained, why do the Five Classics not record it? Why do Zhou and Confucius not speak of it? Why do the sages not transcend the world? Why do the supremely wise not live forever? If Zhou and Confucius did not know of it, they cannot be called sages; if they knew but did not study it, then there is no Dao of immortality.” The *Baopuzi* replies: Human lives correspond to the stars, each with its destined station—this has already been explained in the preceding chapter. You might as well wear a basin on your head and look up, failing to see the radiance of the seven luminaries, or briefly crane your neck toward a great river, unaware of the wonders in its depths.\n\nThere are countless things the Five Classics do not record; there are many matters Zhou and Confucius did not speak of. Let me briefly mention a fraction for you. Though you may laugh uncontrollably and your feelings may be hard to open, let me at least allow you to hear a rough outline.\n\nHeaven and earth are the greatest of all things. The nine sages together composed the *Book of Changes*, which suffices to encompass yin and yang—nothing more can be added. Now, ask a master of the *Changes*: What are the degrees of the celestial sphere? How vast are the four seas? How far apart are the cosmos? Where does the upper limit end? Where does the lower limit rest? What propels their turning and movement? Why do the sun and moon vary in speed? What causes the nine paths’ excesses, the alternation of dawn and dusk, the lengthening and shortening of days? How do the seven stars take turns governing? How do the five planets wax and wane? What causes the halos, eclipses, conjunctions, and transgressions of the four and seven? Where do comets and broom stars emerge? What are the anomalies of celestial arrows and vapors? What are the omens of solar halos and old stars? Why does the pole star not move while the guardian star still drifts east? Why does the sun’s light extend beyond its form, while the moon’s light is cold within? Why does the Milky Way, when viewed from above, embody the nature of moisture flowing downward? Why do the tides ebb and flow with great and small variations? How do the five notes and six pitches convey emotions of joy and anger? How do clouds move and qi rise, bearing signs of fortune and misfortune? What are the *changqiang*, *you shi*, *xun*, and *shizhong*? What are the *sizhen* and *wucan*? What are the *tiangou* and *guixie*? Some bring success through the son, others ruin through the proper way. Even the *Changes* at its most profound cannot address these matters.\n\nNext, ask the masters of the *Spring and Autumn*, the Four Books, the *Book of Songs*, and the Three Ritual Classics—none will be able to answer. They will all say: “These are entirely unrecorded in the orthodox classics; only Wu Xian, Gan Gong, Shi Shen, and Hai Zhong’s Xi Meng recorded them in the *Seven Luminaries*.”",

Beings with elongated arms crossing their thighs, or yellow pools where no men exist? Those with pierced chests or laboring mouths, who build granaries upon stone or rise from sand dunes? Do not dragons and women, Nü Wa and Gong Gong, emerge from the earth, piercing the heavens? Do not falling tiles take flight, and grand words resound? Do mountains shift and altars move? Do entire armies transform in a single morning—nobles into cranes, commoners into sand? Do not the ugly lean upon withered trees, while the Two Fu embrace pillars, and the lodger guards against collapse? The two-headed snake, the bow of *chun* wood, the unburning timber, the unextinguished fire, the birds of Changshu, the eyeless beasts, the headless bodies, the formless trunks? Does not Jingwei fill the sea, do not trees yield their places in turn, does not fire-washed cloth exist, the knife that cuts jade? Does not Yanmei spit flames, does not grinding mud strain water, does not withered wood revive when watered, does not form change upon mountains? The nine-headed *Xiu*, the *Bifang* bird, the *Ren Yu*, the *Shao Qian*’s exorcism, the *Bo Shuai*’s service to the sage minister, the *Su Shuang*’s frost over the western Qiang, the rise of the Xianbei through riding turtles, the strength of Linyi through divine records, the rule of Yongshu through floating corpses, the divine marriage of Emperor Jian, the flying *Zongmu*—do not these transform the world in the peaks of Jing? Did not the Five Ding lure the serpent to topple the mountains, while within, wings beat across the three seas? Were not the golden slips and jade characters revealed beside Yu’s Well? The true mechanism, the balanced scale, the cleaving within patterned stone—are not these marvels numbered in the thousands? Yet the Five Classics do not record them, and Zhou and Confucius do not speak of them. Should we then declare they never occurred?\n\nConsider further: The southerners who enter pillars and exit through their ears; those who halt bandits by stopping water with their elbows and shoot arrows with their arms; Bohun who treads cliffs of ten thousand *ren* yet stands on tiptoe; Lü Liang who walks singing over abysses; Duke Song who carved mulberry leaves to deceive the eye; Gongshu Ban whose wooden kites soared; Li Zhu who discerned the tip of a hair at a hundred paces; Ben and Huo who displayed their strength with ten thousand *jun*; the man of Yue who revived the dead with a needle; Shu Hai who leapt over a thousand paces; the craftsman of Ying who swung his axe at the whitewash on his nose—did not Zhong Du bare his body in freezing weather? None of these could Zhou or Confucius perform. Can we then claim they do not exist?\n\nIf the sage truly has limits, then it is no wonder he did not attain immortality. And if he did not attain immortality, this does no harm to his sageliness. The sage may simply not have mastered such arts—why make this the basis of attack? The sage may choose not to follow the same path, letting nature take its course. He has a body but does not claim it as his own; he has life but does not strive to preserve it. He entrusts life and death to heaven, accepts long and short as fate—so why should it be strange that he did not study immortality?\n\n**On the Meaning of the Dao, Ninth**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: The Dao encompasses heaven and embraces earth, yet in its origin it has no name. To speak of its nonbeing, even echoes and shadows are more substantial than it. To speak of its being, even the myriad things are as nothing before it. Fu Xi could not reckon its multitude, Li Zhu could not perceive its likeness, Wu Zha and Jin Ye could not fathom its sounds. Within the six directions, the *huanxi* and *huanzhu* beasts run swiftly yet cannot trace its signs. Beyond the cosmos, in nearness it flows through autumn down yet remains inexhaustible; in farness it pervades the great void yet is not filled.",

      "translated_text": "The sound’s sound, the echo’s echo, the form’s form, the shadow’s shadow—what is square attains stillness through it, what is round attains motion; what descends attains prostration, what ascends attains reverence. To forcibly name it as the Dao is already to lose its truth, let alone dissecting it a thousand times, dividing it a hundredfold, or splitting it into ten thousand parts—its nature thereby reduced to boundlessness, how far then does it stray from the Dao!\n\nThe common folk cannot recognize the original root of the Great Beginning and instead cultivate its decadent branches. Those who can remain serene and joyful, unstained and unshaken, nurture their minds with desirelessness and preserve their spirits with purity; they sweep away temptations and return to rectitude, dispel thoughts of hard-to-attain things, cast off burdens that harm the true, temper the aberrations of joy and anger, and extinguish the roots of love and aversion. Then, without seeking blessings, blessings come; without averting misfortune, misfortune departs.\n\nWhy is this so? Because destiny lies within, not dependent on externals; the Dao abides here, with no need to await that. Alas! Ordinary people cannot preserve the true: lacking the restraint of barriers, they are swayed by desires and attachments, galloping in dissipation, lost without return. Their emotions stir in response to things, their wisdom overflows in engagement with affairs; seduced by what can be desired, the heavenly principle is extinguished. Deluded by what they see and hear, their purity is corrupted. Their minds are enslaved by extravagance, their spirits muddled by turbulence. Thus, they bring upon themselves calamities of ruin and misfortunes of irretrievable collapse. Yet all they do is slaughter fattened beasts, offer rich libations, strike gongs and drums, sing and dance, prostrate themselves, and kowtow, sitting in stillness and emptiness to beg for blessings, hoping for their fulfillment—until death, they never awaken. How pitiful!\n\nMoreover, their vital essence is exhausted by vexations, their constructive and defensive *qi* depleted by toil. Their form and *qi* are scorched and worn, their heavenly harmony eroded; labor and rest are imbalanced, and their heads are shattered in supplication. Illness arises in the marrow, yet they pray for healing; they lie in wind and dampness, apologizing to spirits, or disrupt their diet and blame demons. Such a frail body brings these afflictions upon itself—what aid can heaven, earth, or the gods provide? What use are their exhaustive sacrifices of livestock?\n\nFor blessings are not obtained through obsequious entreaty.",

      "translated_text": "Disasters are not averted through solemn sacrifices. If fate could be prolonged by repeated prayers and illness dispelled by lavish offerings, then the wealthy would surely live forever and the noble would never fall ill. Yet the gods do not accept sacrifices from those outside their lineage, nor do demons partake of wanton rites. The lanes of the poor cannot attract the golden chariots of the highborn, nor can the gates of commoners stir the six-horse teams of the noble. All share the same human form, yet their stations are worlds apart—how much more so with the celestial gods, distant and exalted, whose nature differs entirely? Their majesty is absolute; surely they cannot be moved by the stinking wine and meager dishes of the vulgar, nor by the bowing and scraping of the common folk. This much is clear.\n\nThose who are disloyal and unfilial commit the gravest of sins. Even if they offer bribes of a thousand gold or feasts of the finest cattle to a wise ruler, they cannot erase their infamy or absolve their guilt before the state. If men cannot absolve men, how much less can one hope to gain long life or cure grave illness through such means? The gods are of a different order, upright and just; to expect their partial favor is delusion. A ruler ashamed of his own failings or a minister who endures disgrace can still reward the good without bribes and punish the wicked without bias, adhering strictly to law without favor or prejudice. How much more so with the gods, who surpass men immeasurably? They cannot be swayed by clever words or bribes in disguise. The lesson is plain.\n\nKing Ling of Chu personally performed as a shaman, sparing no sacrifice, yet could not repel the Wu army’s invasion. The Prince of Guangling in Han exhausted his treasury in devotion to Li Ban, yet could not escape the punishment for rebellion. Emperor Wen, though he revered the gods with unstinting rites, could not avoid his death at Five Oaks. Sun Zhu, despite his noble rank and the enfeoffment of Hua Xiang, could not prolong his allotted span. It was not that their sacrifices were meager or their jades and silks insufficient; their sincerity was not lacking, nor was their reverence shallow. They suffered mountains of loss yet gained not a hair’s benefit. Is this not a case of neglecting what lies near while chasing what is far?\n\nWhen the Fifth Duke eradicated sorcerous ways, he lived long and prospered. When Lujiang of Song abolished mountain sacrifices, his blessings and fortune endured. When Wen Weng destroyed the shrine of the Water Spirit, he enjoyed personal safety and the people’s peace. When the Martial Emperor of Wei banned wanton rites, great fortune followed. These past events are no falsehood—they serve as mirrors for the future.\n\nVirtue alone is fragrant; those without care live long. Frugality preserves life, while excess invites early death. To follow the natural course is to age in health; external forces are of no avail. If one’s nurturing is imbalanced and depletion unchecked, a hundred ailments take root, and the constructive and defensive *qi* wither away. What use then are the grand sacrifices of the three beasts?\n\nThe customs of the day are rife with deceit, each fraud begetting another, growing ever more entrenched. The people, unable to cure their illnesses or awaken from their delusions, abandon the remedies of medicine and stone, clinging instead to the folly of prayers and sacrifices. They beseech without end, consult oracles without wearying. The petty sorcerers and shamans spin tales of calamity and possession, of illness and crisis—nothing is beyond their fabrication. At their behest, the people exhaust their wealth: the rich deplete their stores, the poor borrow at usurious rates, selling their fields and homes until their coffers are empty. If by chance they recover, they credit the gods; if they die, they blame the demons’ refusal to pardon. Should they survive by luck, their fortunes are spent, leaving them to freeze and starve. Some turn to banditry or burglary, meeting their end at the tip of an arrow or under the blade of the executioner, their bodies disgraced by punishment—all due to these very practices.\n\nSome squander all their possessions on sacrificial expenses, their grain and silk consumed by greedy shamans. When the shamans die, there is no money left for coffins or shrouds, and their corpses rot in the open—a pitiable end. How deep is the blindness of the foolish people!\n\nWanton rites and sorcerous deceit are forbidden by ritual and law, yet the common folk remain obstinate in their delusion. It falls to the ruler to sharpen the laws: let no offense, great or small, escape the death penalty. Offer bounties for the capture of shamans who refuse to cease, and execute them without mercy, displaying their bodies in the marketplace. In time, such practices will surely be eradicated. This is no small kindness—it will cut off the source of hunger and cold, stifle the sprouts of theft and banditry.\n\nIn times past, there were men like Zhang Jiao, Liu Gen, Wang Xin, and Li Shen, who claimed to be a thousand years old, peddling petty tricks—appearing and vanishing at will, changing their forms and faces—to deceive the common folk. They gathered the foolish, forming bands of rebels. Their aims were not to prolong life or cure illness, but to amass treacherous followers and stir up rebellion. Soon enough, they met their just deserts, some even bringing ruin to the innocent. Others swindled the people for wealth, amassing mountains of money and silk, surpassing even the nobility in riches. They indulged in extravagance and debauchery, feasting on delicacies, their chambers filled with concubines, their halls lined with musicians, their service manned by assassins and desperadoes. Their power overshadowed local lords, their might intimidated officials, and fugitives found refuge in their dens. All this stemmed from the failure of authorities to suppress them—truly a cause for lament.\n\nThough we common folk may see the truth, without office, what can we do? Those who govern fear that banning such practices might invite divine retribution. Even if some officials harbor doubts, they hesitate to act, deeming it a matter of secondary importance, not urgent enough to risk their careers. Their foolish wives and stubborn children cling to these beliefs, and their underlings, fearing to offend, echo their warnings. Thus, hesitation prevails, and none dare act—how maddening!\n\nI have personally known several men who never worshipped the gods or offered prayers, yet lived long lives, attained high rank, and saw their descendants flourish in wealth and nobility.\n\nFor my part, I have no business with such matters, observing only the seasonal sacrifices to my ancestors. I have traveled by land and water for ten thousand *li*, passing by no fewer than a hundred shrines and temples along the way. Yet on every journey, I have paid them no heed, and my carriages have never overturned, nor have I encountered storms while crossing rivers. Though I have often faced epidemics, I have always found the aid of medicine. Though I have braved arrows and blades, I have suffered no wounds. This only confirms the powerlessness of gods and demons.\n\nAmong the hundred-odd sorcerous sects, all but the Way of Li indulge in blood sacrifices. The latter, though it spares lives, still demands lavish offerings for its rituals—no expense is spared in procuring the finest and freshest provisions. Feeding dozens of people, their kitchen costs are no small matter.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, these practices are not purely simple or frugal—all such sects rightfully belong on the list of those to be banned and eradicated.\n\nSomeone asked, \"When did the Way of Li originate?\" I replied: During the reign of Emperor Da of Wu, there was a man from Shu named Li A who dwelt in caves and ate nothing. He lived for generations, and those who saw him called him the \"Eight-Hundred-Year Elder.\" People often came to consult him, but Li A never spoke; he merely observed their countenance. If their expression was joyful, all matters would be auspicious. If their face bore sorrow, all matters required caution. If Li A smiled, great fortune would follow; if he sighed in warning, deep misfortune lay ahead. Such omens never once failed.\n\nLater, one day, he suddenly vanished without a trace. Afterward, a man named Li Kuan arrived in Wu from Shu. Fluent in the Shu dialect, he could chant incantations over water to cure illnesses, and many were healed. Thus, people far and near unanimously declared Kuan to be Li A and called him \"Li Eight-Hundred,\" though in truth he was not. From high ministers to commoners, none failed to flock to his door. Later, he grew arrogant and noble, no longer granting regular audiences. Visitors could only bow at his outer gate before departing. Such was his strangeness and eccentricity.\n\nOfficials evading service and commoners alike took Kuan as their master, numbering nearly a thousand. Yet those who advanced to the inner chambers and attained high mastery learned nothing more than chanting over water, the Three Section Talismans, and the circulation of solar and lunar *qi*—daily practices devoid of the essential methods for cultivating the body, ingesting divine medicines, or attaining longevity and immortality. Breath ingestion and grain avoidance could sustain one for a hundred days or so, but no longer—such was the shallowness of his arts.\n\nMany of my acquaintances who had met Kuan attested that he grew frail and decrepit with age, coughing and sighing, his eyes dim, ears deaf, teeth fallen, and hair white. Gradually, his mind dulled, and he forgot his own children and grandchildren, no different from an ordinary man. Yet the people insisted that Kuan feigned infirmity to deceive them—could this truly be so?\n\nOnce, Wu suffered a great epidemic, and over half the population perished. The chamber where Kuan practiced his Way was called a \"lodge.\" During the outbreak, Kuan himself contracted a febrile illness. Claiming to enter the lodge for purification and fasting, he died within it. Yet his followers still insisted he had transformed his form and achieved *shijie*—a corpse-liberated immortal—not truly dead.\n\nThe distinction of the divine immortals' methods lies precisely in their transcendence of aging and death. Now, Kuan aged and died—this alone proves he had not attained the Dao. What further doubt could there be? If, by the standards of immortal arts, one ought to achieve *shijie*, why not remain among the people for a century or two, living without death, before departing? The Dao of immortality is not absent in this world—Kuan was simply not the one to attain it.",

      "translated_text": "I have discussed Kuan’s case in such detail because his disciples, passing down their teachings to one another, have spread throughout the lands south of the Yangtze, numbering in the thousands. Unaware of the shallowness of Kuan’s methods and unworthy of their adherence, they cling to them in hopes of transcending the world. My aim is to awaken people to this delusion and dispel their stubborn confusion.\n\nIn the world, things that seem true but are false are countless. Let me briefly recount a few stories to enlighten those who fail to understand.\n\nLong ago in Runan, a man set snares in the fields to trap roe deer. After leaving, he still worried about retrieving his catch, though he neglected to tend to the traps. A fisherman passing by saw them and, placing a salted fish in one of the snares, departed. When the owner returned and found the fish, he was astonished, believing it to be a divine omen. Afraid to take it home, he spread the word among the villagers. Together, they built a shrine and established a temple, naming it the \"Lord Bao.\" Over time, more devotees gathered—red pillars, painted beams, and unceasing bells and drums. If someone’s illness happened to improve, they claimed it was the work of the divine. Travelers passing by never failed to make offerings. After seven or eight years, the fisherman returned to the temple and asked about its origins. When the villagers explained, he said, \"This is merely my salted fish. What divinity is there?\" And so the worship ceased.\n\nAnother tale: In Nandun, a man named Zhang Zhu was plowing a white field when he found a plum sapling in his path. Feeling pity for it, he wanted to take it home but, unable to dig it up at the moment, left it there, covering its roots with damp soil and placing it in a hollow mulberry tree before forgetting about it. Later, Zhang took a distant post and was away for some time. Meanwhile, the villagers noticed the plum tree suddenly growing in the mulberry and called it a miracle. A man with an eye ailment rested beneath the tree and prayed, \"Lord Li, if you heal my eyes, I will offer you a pig in thanks.\" When his eyes happened to improve, he slaughtered the pig and made his offering. Word spread, growing ever more exaggerated, until people claimed the tree could restore sight to the blind. From near and far, they came in droves to seek blessings—carriages and horses filled the roads, and wine and meat flowed like rivers. This continued for several years until Zhang returned from his post. Seeing the commotion, he said, \"This is merely the plum sapling I once planted. What divinity is there?\" He then cut down the tree, and the worship ended.",

Now, Kuan aged and died—this alone proves he had not attained the Dao. What further doubt could there be?

The Dao of immortality is not absent in this world—Kuan was simply not the one to attain it.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, in Runan, there was a Peng family tomb near a major road, with a stone statue standing at its entrance. An old peasant woman, returning from the market with several cakes she had bought, passed by the tomb as the day grew hot. She placed the cakes on the statue’s head to rest beneath the trees, then hurried off and forgot to retrieve them. Travelers who saw the cakes on the stone statue’s head found it strange and asked about it. Someone claimed, \"This stone statue has divine power to heal illnesses, and those who recover offer cakes in thanks.\" The story spread, and people began saying, \"Those with headaches should rub the statue’s head, and those with stomachaches should rub its belly—even rubbing oneself after touching the statue brings healing.\" From a thousand *li* away, people came to seek treatment from the stone statue. At first, they offered only chickens and pigs, but later, they brought oxen and sheep, setting up tents and pavilions with a constant stream of visitors. This continued for several years until the old woman who had forgotten the cakes heard about it. She explained the truth to others, and no one returned to worship the statue.\n\nFurthermore, west of Luoyang, an ancient tomb had collapsed, filling with water. The tomb contained much lime, and the lime-infused water was effective for treating sores. One summer, a traveler suffering from sores, exhausted by the heat, saw the clear water in the tomb and bathed in it. His sores unexpectedly healed. Word spread, and all who were ill came to wash themselves. Some even drank the water to treat internal ailments. The people living near the tomb built a shrine there and sold the water. Those who came to buy it also made offerings at the shrine, with wine and meat flowing endlessly. As demand grew, the water was depleted, so the sellers secretly added other water at night to supplement it. Travelers from afar, unable to visit, sent messengers or entrusted others to buy the water for them. Thus, the sellers grew wealthy. Some claimed there was no divinity at work, and officials eventually prohibited the practice, filling in the tomb to stop it.\n\nIn Xinggu, a prefectural governor named Ma had a relative or old friend who sought his aid. Ma instructed the man to stay outside the city and pretended he was a divine Daoist healer, curing illnesses instantly with his touch. He also sent eloquent men to spread rumors, claiming he could restore sight to the blind and enable the lame to walk. Soon, people from all directions flocked to him like a marketplace, and his wealth in money and silk piled up like a mountain. He ordered all who sought healing—even if they were not immediately cured—to tell others they had recovered. This way, they would eventually heal; if they claimed otherwise, they would never recover. The method was infallible, and none dared doubt it. Thus, when later visitors asked earlier ones about their condition, they all said they had been cured. Within ten days, Ma’s relative amassed great wealth.\n\nMost people, though small-minded and foolish, dismiss methods for extending life and achieving longevity as empty fictions, yet readily believe in malevolent spirits and omens, dancing and praying to so-called gods—all of which are merely Ma’s deceptions to swindle people. I record these several cases as a warning to those who remain unaware.\n\nSomeone asked, \"Why are there those who, though ignorant of the Way, techniques, or arts, still live in peace and enjoy long lives?\"\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity replied: \"Such people may possess hidden virtues or good deeds that bring them blessings, or their fate may simply be long, allowing them to age slowly and die late. Some may also be fortunate enough to avoid disasters by chance—like game left behind in a hunt or grass and trees spared by a passing wildfire. To protect oneself and ward off harm, one should cultivate the arts of guarding the body, wear talismans of celestial patterns, and carry a sword. Ritual sacrifices and prayers are of no benefit; one should rely on one’s own inviolability, not on the forbearance of spirits. However, contemplating the mysterious and holding to unity, embracing the light and encircling the body, can repel evil and dispel misfortune, though it cannot extend life or cure bodily illnesses. Those who follow nature without techniques may still live out their natural years, yet they will have no means to resist violent spirits or great epidemics. Storing armor and stockpiling rain gear is like preparing for war or rain—if neither comes, their absence makes no difference. But when arrows and stones fill the air like mist and smoke, the unarmored will suffer; when torrential rains or blizzards strike, those standing in the open will struggle. One cannot dismiss the vast forces of yin and yang because of the insignificance of shepherd’s purse or wheat, lest later learners be misled into believing techniques are useless.\"\n\n**On Clarifying the Origin (Chapter Ten)**\n\nSomeone asked about the precedence of Confucianism and Daoism.\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity answered: \"The Dao is the root of Confucianism, and Confucianism is the branch of the Dao. The arts of yin and yang are full of taboos, making people timid and fearful. Confucianism is broad but lacks essentials, laborious yet unproductive. Mohism is frugal but hard to follow. Legalism is strict but unkind, harming benevolence and righteousness. Only the teachings of the Daoist school enable people to focus their spirit, move in harmony with non-action, encompass the strengths of Confucianism and Mohism, and summarize the essentials of Legalism. They adapt to changing times, respond to the transformations of things, are concise and easy to understand, require little effort yet yield great results, and aim to preserve the simplicity of the great origin and uphold the source of true integrity. Yet Ban Gu, following Sima Qian, placed the Yellow Emperor and Laozi before the Six Classics, calling Qian’s arrangement mistaken. Qian’s vast knowledge and comprehensive synthesis allowed him to sift through matters, verify the good and bad of events, and assess the uprightness of ancient figures. His evaluations truly stem from nature, and his praises and criticisms are all measured with care.\"",

Liu Xiang, a master scholar of his generation, called it a faithful record, yet Ban Gu’s judgments cannot be hastily accepted as correct. Ban Gu was indeed a pure Confucian, unversed in the intent of the Dao, and thus, constrained by his habitual learning, he could not strike the proper balance.\n\nWhat is meant by the Dao? Is it merely the matter of nurturing life? The *Yi Jing* states: \"The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang; the Dao of Earth is established as softness and hardness; the Dao of Man is established as benevolence and righteousness.\" It further says: \"The *Yi* contains the four Dao of the sage.\" Yet if the right person is not present, the Dao does not manifest in vain. It also says: \"In a flourishing and peaceful world, it is called having the Dao; in a perilous state with a chaotic ruler, it is called lacking the Dao.\" Again: \"To sit and discourse on the Dao is the role of the Three Dukes.\" In a state possessing the Dao, the poor and lowly feel shame.\n\nIn all discussions of the Dao, from the Two Modes above to the myriad things below, none do not proceed from it. Yet the Yellow Emperor and Laozi grasped its root, while the Confucians and Mohists managed its branches. Those today who are called masters of the Dao must broadly comprehend past and present, observe the heavens above and examine the earth below, traverse changes and cross boundaries, fathom the course of rise and fall, and grasp the essence of order and chaos. With minds free of confusion and answers to every question, why must they cultivate the methods of longevity or admire the martial prowess of Master Red Pine and Qiao? Yet the pedantic scholars, with their narrow views and arbitrary judgments, upon hearing of those who dwell in mountains and forests and follow the teachings of Bo Yang, deride and mock them, saying, \"Those are but minor arts, not worth considering.\"\n\nAlas!",

They weigh the depth of rivers and streams yet do not realize that what spews them forth is Kunlun; they prize the harvest of millet and panicled millet yet do not perceive that what brings forth their luxuriance is fertile soil.\n\nNow, if one merely extols Confucian arts yet does not know that what perfects them arises from the Dao—this Dao is what tempers the hundred schools, casts the Two Modes, gestates the myriad beings, and ferments the constant norms. In the world, the shallow and near are many, while the deep and far are few; the few cannot prevail over the many—this has been so for ages. Thus, though Sima Qian was profound, he was not praised; though Ban Gu was limited, he was not censured. Yet things are valued for their rarity and disdained for their abundance—how could human affairs be otherwise? Weeds blanket the plains while magic mushrooms seldom appear; thorns and brambles overrun the wilds while fragrant trees bloom but rarely. Sands and pebbles are countless, yet pearls and jades are scarce. Hawks and falcons swarm the skies, but phoenixes seldom take flight; vipers and lizards fill the marshes, yet dragons are rarely seen. That Ban Gu had many partisans is only fitting.\n\nThe Dao, when applied inwardly, governs the self; when extended outwardly, it orders the state. It ensures the Seven Governors follow their courses, the Two Qi harmonize, and the four seasons do not err in their cycles of cold and warmth. Wind and rain do not turn violent to become calamities for creatures. The Jade Candle heralds the signs of ascending peace; clear sweet wine manifests the tokens of virtue’s harmony. The burning wheel and rainbow lie dormant, their omens quelled; clouds of decay and Shangyang birds fold their wings. Splendor shines on high, auspicious grain gathers in abundance, pestilence does not spread, and disasters do not arise. Moats and ramparts are not built, shields and spears are not wielded. Without deliberation, all is fitting; without covenant, trust is firm; without binding, all is secure; without scheming, all is accomplished; without reward, all are encouraged; without punishment, all is solemn. What is sought is obtained without seeking; what is forbidden ceases without prohibition. Those above are not deemed burdensome; those ahead are not resented as troubles. Before a command is issued, customs shift; before an order is given, mores transform—such is the governance of the Dao.\n\nThus, when the Dao flourishes, the Three August Ones and Five Emperors ruled with folded arms, and all was more than sufficient.",

Only when there is sufficiency does non-action bring forth beautiful transformation; only when there is insufficiency do punishments grow harsh and villainy multiply.

Some see floods surge wildly; some endure scorching droughts that parch the earth; some witness mountains and valleys shift their forms; some hear winter thunder and summer snow.

The higher the walls, the craftier the siege engines; the deeper the moats, the more ingenious the ladders. The clearer the laws, the more thieves and bandits; the more frequent the covenants, the worse the rebellions.

      "translated_text": "Thus, true persons moved unhurried among the people, never hastening toward transcendence. In later ages, moral decay and artifice grew ever deeper; the transformative influence of the pure and tranquil waned, while the factions of perverse customs multiplied. Those who did not trust the Dao delighted in slander, calling the truly upright \"deviant\" and \"errant,\" dismissing divine transcendents as \"deluded\" and \"absurd.\" Some accused them of \"bewitching the masses,\" others of \"disrupting the social order.\" Therefore, the loftiest scholars felt shame in dwelling among them.\n\nIn former times, the perspicacious perceived the first signs of decline and fled at the slightest hint of danger, departing by night without waiting for dawn. They acted at the first glimpse of peril, not lingering until the day’s end. Thus, when Zhao plotted against Mingdu, Confucius turned his carriage back; when no sweet wine was offered, Musheng departed at once. If even Hua Yuan left such a place, how much more should the wise? Their pursuits and roots were fundamentally different—what attachment could they have to remaining there?\n\nWhen the deep pools dry and the marshes drain, the jiao-dragons no longer swim. When nests topple and eggs are gathered, the phoenixes no longer alight. When one dwells in a house where slander is spoken, the soaring gulls do not descend. When common plants are pruned in spring, the sacred mushrooms and lingzhi do not flourish. As vulgar customs vilify the upright and heap scorn upon them, how could those who possess the Dao not spread their wings and soar beyond? Would they not rather conceal their tracks in the boundless expanse of the unseen?\n\nThe mountains and forests are not the Dao itself, yet those who seek the Dao inevitably enter the mountains and forests. Truly, they wish to distance themselves from the foul stench of the world and draw near to this purity. Those who enter the nine chambers to refine their thoughts and preserve the true unity to summon the spirits do not delight in clamor or defilement. Those who compound the great elixir of golden cinnabar and refine the flying essence of the eight minerals particularly abhor the chatter of fools and the perceptions of the vulgar. When such disturbances arise, the numinous spirits do not descend, and the divine medicines do not form—this is no minor prohibition.\n\nIf one remains among people, shallow critics may slander them, officials may impose punishments or bestow favors, and relatives or old acquaintances may entangle them with celebrations or mourning. How much better to retreat to secluded valleys, entirely free from such verminous nuisances! Those who wander alone in the distant wilds find their joy in the towering peaks—is this not the reason?\n\nSome say: \"The highest scholars attain the Dao amid the three armies, the middling scholars attain it in the cities, and the lowest scholars attain it in the mountains and forests.\" This refers to those who have already completed the divine medicine but do not yet wish to ascend to heaven. Though they may be among the three armies, blades cannot harm them; though they may be in the cities, human calamities cannot touch them.

      "translated_text": "Gezhi Zibao (The Master Who Embraces Simplicity) said: The teachings of rising and descending, bowing and looking up; the rituals of three thousand refinements; the arts of attack and defense, advance and retreat; the discipline of lightening the body and esteeming righteousness; the matters of joy and sorrow, rites and music; and the strategies for governing the world and aiding the common people—these are the concerns of the Confucians. External things are discarded, the world is forsaken, scheming is cleansed away, wealth and nobility are forgotten, dissuasion and encouragement are cut off, and one does not grieve over poverty, nor rejoice in prosperity; neither does one sorrow in adversity nor delight in praise—these are the practices of the Daoists.\n\nConfucians perform sacrifices to pray for blessings, while Daoists walk in rectitude to ward off evil. What Confucians cherish is power and profit; what Daoists treasure is desirelessness. Confucians are ever eager for fame and gain, while Daoists embrace the One and cultivate solitude. What Confucians study are the ledgers of mutual scrutiny; what Daoists practice are the teachings of dispelling emotions and admonitions.\n\nAs for the Dao: in its becoming, it excels in self-cultivation to accomplish its tasks; in its dwelling, it excels in claiming what others do not contend for; in its governance, it excels in severing misfortune before it arises; in its bestowal, it excels in aiding beings without claiming virtue; in its movement, it excels in observing the people to apply its mind; in its stillness, it excels in abiding cautiously without distress. This is why it is the sovereign of the hundred schools and the ancestor of benevolence and righteousness. The minor differences in principle are thus compared—yet the fundamental rise and fall of its essence remains unchanged.\n\nSomeone said: The Confucians are Zhou and Kong; their texts are the Six Classics. They are the means by which the world is governed and rectitude preserved, the standards for establishing oneself and conducting affairs. Their use is far-reaching, their enterprise noble, their affairs grand, their words beautiful—they are the unchanging institutions for states and families. As for those who practice the Dao, they do not cultivate ritual teachings, nor regard great human relations. They consort with foxes and raccoons in the marshes, pair with apes and monkeys in the forests, solitary and drifting, taking trees and stones as neighbors. This is like the folly of the eastward-running rat or the sweetness of the sunflower—deluded and self-indulgent.\n\nGezhi Zibao replied: I do not esteem the display of flowers or the galloping of ornate words; I have long been sated with correcting the ignorant and rescuing the deluded. Truly, I do not wish to contend with you over the merits of principles or debate gains and losses at the tip of the tongue. Yet seeing a child fall into a well is not the intent of the benevolent; watching a blind man strike a pillar is not the heart of universal love. Thus, I briefly set forth an outline, roughly holding up one corner.\n\nThose who embody the Dao to craft things and treasure virtue to attain longevity follow the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. The Yellow Emperor governed the world and brought about great peace, yet he also ascended as an immortal—how can he be deemed inferior to Yao and Shun? Laozi both synthesized and administered teachings, yet he also attained long vision—how can he be considered lesser than Zhou or Kong? Thus, Confucius sighed in admiration, yet I have never heard him utter words of disparagement. That later generations of mediocre people, failing to enter its gate, practice Confucianism and Mohism while slandering Daoism—how is this different from descendants cursing their ancestors? They do not recognize their own origins; this is truly excessive.\n\nThe hands of a dwarf cannot topple Mount Song or Hua; the legs of a pygmy cannot fathom the vast sea. Yet I often see vulgar, tree-stump-clinging Confucians, narrowly absorbed in their studies, ignorant of broad principles, instructing the stubborn and commanding the foolish, adorning evil words to falsely interrogate Daoists. When they speak of the dregs of糟粕, it is as if they glimpse a swift horse passing a crack; when they wade into the abyss of the spirit, they drown and lose themselves. Like the sparrow flapping its short wings to ride the waves of the sunlit sea, or the fly straining its weak body to cross the peaks of the sun-monkey—tasks beyond their capacity, only hastening their distress. Yet they croak within their narrow confines, their ears unversed in the vast, their eyes unpenetrating of the distant. Aspiring to stand on tiptoe to encompass the Three Luminaries, drumming their bellies to stir lightning—how can their dullness not be obscured?\n\nOnly by ascending the distant mystery of the celestial sphere does one know the depths of the well and valley; only by beholding the brilliance of the great light in the heavens does one recognize the paltriness of the wren’s nest. I was not born with knowledge, nor did I believe in it from youth. At first, I too was as ignorant as you. Yet after observing the vastness of its profound secrets, I regret not escaping my ignorance sooner.\n\nThe affairs of the Five Classics are illuminated by commentaries and explanations, yet even beginners may not understand them—how much more so the golden tablets and jade slips of the divine immortals’ scriptures, the essential words that are often not written down? Only after ascending the altar and swearing blood oaths are the oral instructions transmitted. If one is not the right person, even if offered land split asunder, halls filled with gold and jade, they will not be casually shown.\n\nThough one may obtain the texts, without a teacher’s guidance, it is like looking up without seeing the head or looking down without knowing the feet—how could you, sir, be thoroughly familiar with this? Those who attain immortality may ascend to the Great Clarity, soar in the Purple Empyrean, reach the Mystic Isles, or dwell in the paulownia of the Celestial Hook’s music, feasting on nine-fold fungi. They carry pine and cassia beyond the inverted shadows, banquet in the Jasper Chambers of the Eternal Sun—why should they consort with foxes and raccoons or pair with apes and monkeys? This is what is called \"acting without knowledge.\" Such is the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "Those who roam freely amidst the rainbow’s arc, soaring through the cinnabar skies, traversing the vastness of the Six Voids—all is shaped by their intent. Though cast aside and left to drift, they feel no sorrow.\n\nGathered in herds, adorned in embroidered silks—yet when weighed against joy, how does this compare to the solitary flight of the untethered unicorn? The auspicious light parts from its mate, yet its fortune abounds.\n\n**Elixirs of Immortality, Chapter Eleven**\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: The *Divine Farmer’s Four Classics* says, \"Superior elixirs bring bodily peace, prolong life, and enable ascent as celestial spirits, roaming above and below, commanding the myriad spirits, growing feathers and wings, summoning traveling kitchens, and arriving in an instant.\" It further says, \"The Five Fungi, cinnabar, jade tablets, malachite, realgar, orpiment, mica, *Taiyi*’s leftover grain—each may be taken alone, all granting flight and longevity.\" It also says, \"Middle-grade elixirs nurture nature; lower-grade ones dispel illness. They render poisons powerless, keep fierce beasts at bay, ward off malign qi, and repel all malevolent spirits.\" The *Filial Classics’ Divine Concordance* states: \"Pepper and ginger repel dampness; calamus sharpens hearing; sesame prolongs life; *weixi* averts weapons—all are the utmost words of the supreme sages, the true records of esoteric arts.\"\n\nThe texts are clear and luminous, yet the world’s people ultimately do not believe—how lamentable!\n\nAmong elixirs of immortality, cinnabar ranks highest, followed by gold, then silver, then the various fungi, then the Five Jades, then mica, then luminous pearls, then realgar, then *Taiyi*’s leftover grain, then *shizhonghuangzi*, then *shigui*, then quartz, then *shinao*, then sulfur, then *shidan*, then malachite, then pine and cypress resin, *fuling*, rehmannia, *maimendong*, sesame, *chonglou*, coptis, *shiwei*, paper mulberry fruit, and *xiangchai* (also called *chunlu*). Some call it *xianrenzhang*, others *Queen Mother of the West’s Staff*, or *tianjing*, or *que lao*, or *digua*, or *gouqi*.\n\n*Tianmendong* is also called *dimendong*, *yanmendong*, *dianji*, *yinyangshi*, or *guansong*. That which grows in high places has short roots, a sweet taste, and fragrant qi—this is superior. That which grows by water or in lowlands has fine leaves resembling *yun*, yellowish bark, long roots, a bitter taste, and foul qi—this is inferior. It may still be consumed, but it tends to induce qi descent, though its benefits are slower. After a hundred days of consumption, one becomes robust, surpassing even those who take *zhu* or *huangjing*. Upon entering the mountains, it may be steamed or boiled and eaten to sate hunger, granting strength and enabling grain abstention. It may also be made into powder or its juice extracted for wine—consuming the powder is especially fine. The people of Chu call *tianmendong* *baibu*, yet there exists another *baibu* herb whose roots resemble a hundred clustered together, though their sprouts differ slightly. True *baibu* resembles *baxie* and is used only to treat coughs and repel lice—it is unsuitable for consumption and must not be mistaken. For example, *huangjing* is also called *baiji*, but it is not the *baiji* used to make paste. According to the *Materia Medica*, many herbs share names with others; only the meticulous and learned can distinguish them—one must be thorough.\n\n*Huangjing* is also called *yuzhu*, *jiuqiong*, or *chuizhu*. Consuming its flowers surpasses its fruit; consuming its fruit surpasses its roots. However, flowers are difficult to gather in quantity—ten *hu* of fresh flowers yield only five or six *dou* when dried. A daily dose of three *ge* requires great effort to prepare. Consuming *huangjing* for a mere decade yields substantial benefits. Both it and *zhu* enable grain abstention, but *zhu* nourishes strength, allowing one to bear heavy loads and traverse perilous paths. Yet it does not match *huangjing* in sweetness and ease of consumption, which can sustain the elderly and young during famines. Those unable to distinguish them mistake it for dried rice.\n\nThe Five Fungi comprise stone fungi, wood fungi, herb fungi, flesh fungi, and mushroom fungi—each with a hundred or so varieties.\n\n**Stone Fungi** resemble living creatures, growing on the shores of distant seas, famous mountains, and island cliffs where stones accumulate. They take the form of creatures with heads, tails, and four limbs—those resembling living beings are superior. They cling to large stones, favoring lofty peaks and perilous cliffs, often inverted or suspended. Red ones resemble coral, white ones like sliced fat, black ones like lacquer, green ones like kingfisher feathers, and yellow ones like purple gold—all are luminous and translucent like solid ice. On dark nights, their glow is visible from three hundred paces. Large ones weigh over ten *jin*; small ones, three or four *jin*. Without prolonged refinement, utmost essence, and the talismans of *Laozi’s* *Five Treasures of Lingbao*, one cannot encounter them. Upon seeing any fungus, first place the *Kaishan Jihai Fu* upon it to prevent it from vanishing or transforming. Then, on an auspicious day, perform a ritual with wine and dried meat, pray, and gather it by approaching from the sun’s direction, stepping with *Yubu*, and holding one’s breath. If one obtains a stone-simulacrum fungus, pound it thirty-six thousand times and consume a *fangcunbi* daily. Finishing one *jin* grants a thousand years; ten *jin*, ten thousand years. It may also be shared with others.\n\n**Jade-Fat Fungi** grow on jade-rich mountains, often in precarious places where jade sap flows. After ten thousand years, it congeals into fungi, sometimes resembling birds or beasts, though their forms and colors vary. Most resemble mountain *xuan* and water *cang* jade, lustrous as crystal. Ground into powder and mixed with *wuxincao* juice, it soon turns to liquid. Drinking one *sheng* grants a thousand years.\n\n**Seven Luminaries and Nine Radiance Fungi** are also stones, growing on high cliffs near water. They resemble plates or bowls, no larger than a *chi* in diameter, with stems rising three or four *cun*. Those with seven holes are called *Seven Luminaries*; those with nine, *Nine Radiance*. Their lights resemble stars, visible at night from over a hundred paces. Their glow is distinct—scatterable but not combinable. Gather them at the autumn equinox, pound them, and consume a *fangcunbi*. Upon entering the mouth, one’s body harmonizes with the five flavors, sweet and delicious. Consuming one *jin* grants a thousand years, bestowing a luminous body. In dark places, one sees as if by moonlight, enabling night vision.\n\n**Stone Toad Fungi** grow in the stone chambers of Shaoshi Mountain. Within the chambers lies a deep valley, impossible to cross. Tossing a stone into it, the sound echoes for half a day. Ten-odd *zhang* outside the chamber stands a stone pillar topped with a stone canopy, about a *zhang* tall and wide. The *toad* fungus emerges from the stone chamber, resting beneath the canopy, which never overflows.",

      "translated_text": "The stone chamber’s entrance is carved with tadpole script, reading: *\"One who consumes a *dou* of Stone Toad Fungi shall live ten thousand years.\"* Daoist adepts have long pondered this place, yet none can reach it. The only method is to affix a bowl to the tip of sturdy bamboo or wood to catch it—but none have succeeded. Judging by the inscription, there must have been those in ancient times who obtained it.\n\n**Stone Cassia Fungi** grow in the stone caves of renowned mountains, resembling cassia trees but with stone-like fruit. About a *chi* tall and a *chi* in diameter, they glow and taste pungent, with branches. Pounding and consuming one *jin* grants a thousand years.\n\n**Stone Yellow Seeds** are found everywhere, but the Qin River Mountains yield the most. When embedded in large stones, the stone remains perpetually moist, never dry. Striking the stone dozens of times reveals them, nestled within like an egg in its shell. They must be consumed immediately—if left, they harden into stone and become unfit for ingestion. The proper method is to drink them before they solidify; once hardened, they should be ground into powder. Breaking open a stone may yield as much as a *sheng* or as little as a few *ge*, which can be consumed at once. Even if one cannot obtain much, continuous consumption—totaling three *sheng*—grants a thousand years. The only hindrance is their scarcity.\n\n**Stone Brain Fungi** grow within talc, resembling Stone Yellow Seeds but not always present. Breaking open a thousand or so large talc stones may yield one. When first split, it glows with five colors within the stone and moves of its own accord. Consuming one *sheng* grants a thousand years.\n\n**Stone Sulfur Fungi** are found on the Five Peaks, with Mount Ji yielding the most. According to local legend, Xu You consumed them here to attain longevity, freeing him from worldly concerns and allowing him to decline Yao’s abdication. Known as *Sulfur Elixir*, it is the red essence of stone sulfur, seeping from cliffs. The moist form can be rolled into pills, while the hardened form can be ground into powder. There are one hundred and twenty varieties of stone fungi, as recorded in the *Taiyi Jade Formula* and *Changyu Inner Records*, though they cannot all be enumerated here.\n\n**Wood Fungi** include *fuling*, formed when pine resin seeps into the earth and transforms over a thousand years. After ten thousand years, a small plant resembling a lotus flower grows atop it, called *Wood Might-Joy Fungi*. It glows at night, feels slippery to the touch, and does not burn when lit. Carrying it repels weapons: place a chicken wearing it among eleven others in a coop, then shoot twelve arrows from twelve paces away—the other chickens will be struck, but the one with the fungus remains unharmed. Harvest it from the *Gate of Life*, dry it in the shade for a hundred days, then grind and consume a *fangcunbi* three times daily. Consuming one entire fungus grants three thousand years.\n\n**Thousand-Year Cypress** has roots resembling a seated person, seven *cun* long. When carved, it bleeds. Applying its sap to the soles of the feet allows one to walk on water without sinking. Rubbing it inside the nostrils lets one enter water, which parts to allow dwelling at the riverbed. Applying it to the body grants the form of a dragon—desired visions appear upon wiping it away. It also cures illnesses: scrape and consume a *daogui* for internal ailments, or apply it to external swellings and pains, which vanish instantly. For example, if the left foot is afflicted, scrape the left foot of a figurine. Mixed with *jusheng* and shaped into a candle, its light reveals buried treasures—gold and jade—by turning green and bending downward. Digging with a spade uncovers them. Consuming ten *jin* of its powder grants a thousand years.\n\n**Flying Node Fungi** grow within the bark of three-thousand-year-old pine trees, resembling coiled dragons. The largest weigh ten *jin*. Consuming ten *jin* of its powder grants five hundred years.\n\n**Fan Peach Fungi** resemble ascending dragons, with flowers and leaves like red gauze and fruit like kingfishers. No taller than five *chi*, they grow on the shady sides of famous mountains near east-flowing springs. Harvested at the *Start of Summer*, their powder grants five thousand years when consumed entirely.\n\n**Triple-Union Fungi** are red and luminous. When struck, their branches and leaves chime like metal or stone, yet snap back together if broken. **Wood Channel Fungi** grow parasitically on large trees, resembling nine-stemmed lotus clusters, sweet and pungent. **Jian Wood Fungi** bear fruit in *Duguang*, their bark like *yingshe* vines and fruit like *luan* birds. Consuming any of these three grants ascent to heaven in broad daylight.\n\n**Yellow Reed Seeds**, **Prevention Wood Blossoms**, and **Mysterious Liquid Blossoms** grow on Mount Tai in Yaoxiang and Fenghao. Consuming them grants a thousand years.\n\n**Yellow Cedar Root Fungi** grow beneath yellow cedar trees, resembling three-*hu* vessels, connected to the main trunk by fine roots twenty to thirty *zhang* away, like threads. Consuming its powder entirely grants earthly immortality.\n\nThere are one hundred and twenty such varieties, each illustrated in accompanying diagrams.\n\n**Herb Fungi** include:\n- **Solitary Sway Fungi**, which move without wind. Their stems are finger-thick, red as cinnabar, with leaves like amaranth. The main root resembles a *dou*, with smaller roots like chicken eggs, twelve in total, encircling the main root like the twelve earthly branches. Each is a *zhang* apart, connected by fine roots like white hair. They grow atop high mountains and deep valleys, where no other plants thrive. Consuming the main root’s powder entirely grants a thousand years; consuming a smaller root grants a hundred years and can be shared with others. Carrying the main root grants a dragon’s form—turning it left reveals it.\n- **Ox-Horn Fungi**, found on Tiger Longevity Mountain and Wu Slope, resemble scallions but grow singularly like ox horns, three to four *chi* long and blue. Consuming a *fangcunbi* three times daily for a hundred days grants a thousand years.\n- **Dragon Immortal Fungi**, resembling ascending dragons with leaf-scales and roots like coiled dragons. Consuming one branch grants a thousand years.\n- **Hemp Mother Fungi**, resembling hemp but with red stems and purple flowers.\n- **Pearl Fungi**, with yellow flowers, red leaves, and purple fruit like plums, twenty-four hanging in strands like pearls.\n- **White Talisman Fungi**, four to five *chi* tall, resembling plum trees, blooming in heavy snow and fruiting in late winter.\n- **Vermilion Grass Fungi**, with nine bends, each bearing three leaves—each leaf representing three generations.",

Within the chambers lies a deep valley, impossible to cross. Tossing a stone into it, the sound echoes for half a day. Ten-odd *zhang* outside the chamber stands a stone pillar topped with a stone canopy, about a *zhang* tall and wide. The *toad* fungus emerges from the stone chamber, resting beneath the canopy, which never overflows.",

      "translated_text": "The **Five-Virtue Fungi** resemble towering halls, their square stems bearing leaves of five colors, each distinct and unmingled. Above, they form an inverted canopy, and within, sweet dew gathers while purple qi rises several *chi* high.\n\nThe **Dragon-Chariot Fungi** invariably sprout in pairs during mid-spring, with three nodes and twelve branches. Their roots resemble seated figures.\n\nThese herbal fungi number one hundred and twenty kinds in all. When dried in the shade and consumed, they enable one to endure as long as heaven and earth—some granting a thousand years, others two thousand.\n\nThe **Flesh Fungi** include:\n- The **Ten-Thousand-Year Toad**, which bears horns on its head and eight red characters inscribed beneath its chin. Heavy in body, it is captured at noon on the fifth day of the fifth month, then dried in the shade for a hundred days. Drawing on the ground with its left foot summons flowing water, while wearing its left hand on the body repels all weapons. Should an enemy shoot at one, the bow, crossbow, and arrows reverse course to strike the assailant.\n- The **Thousand-Year Bat**, white as snow, roosts upside down due to the weight of its brain.\n\nWhen these two creatures are dried in the shade, ground into powder, and consumed, they grant a lifespan of forty thousand years.\n\nThe **Thousand-Year Spirit-Turtle** displays all five colors. The male’s forehead bears two bony ridges resembling horns; bathing it in sheep’s blood allows one to scrape off its shell, which is then roasted over fire, ground, and consumed in *fangcunbi* doses thrice daily. Consuming one entire shell grants a thousand years.\n\nEncountering in the mountains small figures riding carriages or horses, seven or eight *cun* tall, signifies **Flesh Fungi**. Capturing and consuming them bestows immortality.\n\nThe **Wind-Born Beast** resembles a leopard, blue in color and the size of a wildcat, dwelling in the great forests of the Southern Sea. To capture it, hunters gather cartloads of firewood and set it ablaze. When the wood is consumed, the beast remains unscathed amid the ashes, its fur unburned and impervious to blades or piercing. Striking it feels like beating a leather sack; only after forging it with an iron hammer for thousands of blows does it die. Upon death, it gapes toward the wind, and in moments revives and flees. Plugging its nostrils with *Acorus* from a stone causes it to die. Its brain, mixed with chrysanthemum and consumed—ten *jin* in total—grants five hundred years.\n\nThe **Thousand-Year Swallow** nests with its entrance facing north, its plumage mostly white with a forked tail. When dug up, dried in the shade, and ground into powder, consuming one grants five hundred years.\n\nThese, too, number one hundred and twenty kinds, all classified as **Flesh Fungi**.\n\nThe **Mushroom Fungi** grow in deep mountains, beneath great trees, or beside springs. Their forms vary—some like palaces, others like carriages or horses, dragons or tigers, human figures, or flying birds—shifting in color without constancy. They, too, number one hundred and twenty kinds, each depicted in illustrations. To gather them, one must perform the **Yu Step**, cut them with a bone knife, dry them in the shade, grind them into powder, and consume a *fangcunbi* dose. The superior varieties confer several thousand years, the lesser a thousand.\n\nTo seek fungal herbs in famous mountains, one must enter during the third or ninth month—when the mountains open to yield divine medicines. Avoid inauspicious days; instead, choose times of **Heavenly Assistance** or the **Three Auspicious** for added protection. On reaching the mountain, select a **Six Yin Day** during the **Hall of Light** hour. Carry a **Lingbao Talisman**, lead a white dog, hold a white chicken, and bring a *dou* of white salt along with an **Opening Mountain Talisman** and memorial, placing them on a large stone. Hold a bunch of **Wu Tang Grass** (or flowers) to enter the mountain, for the mountain spirits delight in this and will grant success.\n\nWhen gathering or consuming fungi, choose days when the **Celestial Stems and Earthly Branches** align in mutual generation for optimal harmony.\n\nThese fungi abound in famous mountains, yet ordinary Daoists—lacking single-minded devotion, deficient in virtue, and ignorant of mountain-entry techniques—may possess the illustrations but fail to recognize the fungi, thus never obtaining them. Mountains, regardless of size, are guarded by **Guai Spirits**, who do not bestow fungi upon the unworthy. Even if one treads upon them, they remain invisible.\n\n**Mica** has five varieties, though most cannot distinguish them. The method: hold it toward the sun, carefully observe its hues, and discern its nature. Viewing it in the shade reveals no mixed colors.\n\n- When all five colors are present but green dominates, it is **Yunying** (Cloud Essence), best consumed in spring.\n- When all five colors are present but red dominates, it is **Yunzhu** (Cloud Pearl), best consumed in summer.\n- When all five colors are present but white dominates, it is **Yunye** (Cloud Liquid), best consumed in autumn.\n- When all five colors are present but black dominates, it is **Yunmu** (Cloud Mother), best consumed in winter.\n- When only green and yellow appear, it is **Yunsha** (Cloud Sand), best consumed in late summer.\n- Pure white and lustrous mica is **Linshi** (Phosphorus Stone), suitable for consumption in all seasons.\n\nMethods for refining the **Five Clouds**:\n- Infuse with cassia, scallion, or jade to transform into water.\n- Steep in dew within an iron vessel, then simmer with **Xuan Water** to produce liquid.\n- Seal with saltpeter in a tube and bury to create water.\n- Knead into curd.\n- Soak in autumn dew for a hundred days, then pound in a leather pouch to make powder.\n- Mix with **Wudian Grass** and *Ailanthus* blood for consumption.\n\nConsuming it for a year cures all illnesses; for three years, an old man reverts to youth; for five years, one commands **Guai Spirits**, walks through fire unburned, enters water unsoaked, and treads thorns unharmed, meeting immortals. Other substances char when buried, but the **Five Clouds** remain unburned even in raging fires and never decay, thus granting longevity.\n\nAfter ten years of consumption, clouds perpetually shroud one’s head. Consuming the mother (Yunmu) begets the child (other varieties)—a natural principle.\n\nWhen held toward the sun, if a murky, pure black hue appears, it is unfit for consumption, causing illness, strangury, sores, and other afflictions. Even when prepared as water or powder, it must first be soaked for a hundred days in water from thatched roofs, east-flowing streams, or dew, then washed to remove impurities before use.\n\n**Wei Shuqing** of Zhongshan consumed it for years, eventually riding clouds. He sealed the formula in a jade box, and after ascending, his son **Shi** and the Han envoy **Liang Bo** obtained it, followed the method, and likewise attained immortality.\n\n**Realgar** must come from Wudu Mountain, pure and unadulterated, its red hue like a rooster’s comb, radiant and gleaming. Only this is suitable for immortality elixirs. Pure yellow realgar lacking red luster is unfit for immortality but may be used in medicinal compounds.\n\nMethods of consumption:\n- Steaming or boiling.\n- Mixing with wine.\n- Dissolving with saltpeter into water, then solidifying.\n- Wrapping in **Xuan Intestines**, steaming beneath red earth.\n- Blending with pine resin.\n- Refining with three substances to draw it out like cloth, white as ice.\n\nConsumption grants longevity, cures all diseases, expels the **Three Corpses**, erases scars, restores black hair, and regrows fallen teeth. After a thousand days, **Jade Maidens** attend, ready to serve and summon traveling kitchens. The Jade Maidens always bear a yellow jade mark on their noses, the size of millet—a sign of authenticity.",

      "translated_text": "Those lacking this mark are but demons testing men. Jade, too, is an immortality elixir, though difficult to obtain. The *Scripture of Jade* states: \"He who consumes gold attains longevity like gold; he who consumes jade attains longevity like jade.\" It further says: \"He who ingests the **Mysterious Perfection** knows no end to his life.\" The **Mysterious Perfection** is another name for jade. Its consumption enables the body to become light and ascend—yet this is not merely earthbound immortality. However, the Way is slow to manifest; only after consuming one or two hundred *jin* does one begin to perceive its effects.\n\nJade may be dissolved into water using **Black Rice Wine** or **Sanguisorba Wine**, or melted into a paste with scallion broth. It may also be ingested as pills or burned into powder. After a year of consumption, one becomes impervious to water, fire, blades, and all poisons. Yet one must not use jade that has already been fashioned into vessels, for it harms without benefit—only unworked jade (*pu* jade) is suitable.\n\nThe finest jade comes from Khotan, particularly the white variety. Next in quality is the jade from the borders of Xuyanting in Nanyang, as well as that from the waters of Lurong in Rinan. **Master Red Pine** soaked jade in **Mysterious Worm** blood to transform it into liquid, which he then consumed—thus enabling him to ride the smoke and ascend or descend at will.\n\nWhile jade shavings, whether taken dry or dissolved in water, grant immortality, they are inferior to gold in that they frequently induce **cold-food powder**-like symptoms, such as outbreaks of sores. To prevent this, those who consume jade shavings should take, every ten days, a *daorui* each of realgar and cinnabar. Afterward, they should bathe, wash their hair, and walk against the wind in cold water to avert the outbreaks.\n\nDong Junyi once gave **Jade Elixir** to a blind man, whose sight was restored within ten days. There was also Wu Yanzhi, who was determined to consume jade. Though he obtained the *Scripture of Jade* and its methods, he did not fully grasp its regulations and prohibitions. He gathered a vast quantity of ritual tablets, rings, discs, and even the fittings of swords, intending to refine and ingest them. After I explained that these were unsuitable, he sighed and said, \"This matter cannot be approached without precision—not only is it futile, but it may even invite disaster.\"\n\nSilver, while inferior to gold and jade, may still confer earthbound immortality.",

      "translated_text": "The method of ingestion involves dissolving it in wheat broth, or consuming it with wine infused with *zhu* grass, or refining it with dragon fat. However, after three doses, it becomes as large as a pellet—something beyond the means of impoverished Daoist practitioners. Pearls measuring over an inch in diameter may also be consumed, granting longevity. Soaked in yogurt or broth, they dissolve like liquid mercury; alternatively, they may be dissolved in *fushi* water or *ke* water, then wrapped in *tongshe* yellow and combined to form strands three or four feet long. Ingested as pills, they enable fasting and confer immortality.\n\nPure lacquer that does not adhere may be consumed to commune with spirits and attain longevity. The method of ingestion involves either mixing it with ten large crabs (also called \"the gutless lord\") or combining it with mica-infused water or jade-infused water. After consumption, the nine worms are expelled, and foul blood departs through the nose. Within a year, the Six Jia spirits will provide divine sustenance. Cinnamon may be steamed with scallion juice to produce a liquid, or consumed with bamboo sap, or mixed with *xianzhi* stone brain (also called *xuan*). After seven years of ingestion, one may walk upon water and achieve immortality.\n\n*Jusheng* (also called sesame) prevents aging, resists wind and dampness, and replenishes vitality in the elderly. Peach resin, soaked in mulberry ash water and consumed, cures all illnesses; prolonged ingestion lightens the body and grants luminosity, so that in dark nights, one shines like the moon. Excessive consumption enables fasting. The red fruit of the *ning* (or *chu*) tree, ingested for a year, restores youth to the elderly and grants clear vision, revealing spirits. The Daoist Liang Xu, at seventy, consumed it and grew younger, reaching 140 years of age. He could write at night and outrun horses, later ascending to Green Dragon Mountain. *Huaizi* seeds should be sealed in a new jar with mud for over twenty days until their outer skin rots, then washed to resemble large soybeans. Daily consumption nourishes the brain, prevents graying hair, and grants longevity. Among the three hundred-odd herbs in the *Xuan Zhong Man Fang*, such as *Chu feilian*, *zexie*, *dihuang*, and *huanglian*, all extend lifespan and may be consumed individually.\n\nThe *Lingfei Powder*, *Weiyang Pill*, *Zhiming Pill*, and *Yangxue Pill* all preserve youth and reverse aging. In the mountains of Lixian County, Nanyang, there is a Sweet Valley Brook, whose sweetness arises from the surrounding sweet chrysanthemums. Their blossoms fall into the water over generations, altering its taste. The residents near this valley do not dig wells but drink solely from the Sweet Valley Brook. None fail to live long lives—some reach 140 or 150 years, while the youngest live to eighty or ninety, with no premature deaths. This is due to the power of the chrysanthemums.\n\nThus, when the Minister of Ceremonies Wang Chang, the Grand Commandant Liu Kuan, and the Grand Tutor Yuan Wei served as governors of Nanyang, they each ordered Lixian County to deliver forty *hu* of Sweet Valley water monthly for their consumption. Though these officials suffered from wind impediment and dim vision, their conditions improved. However, they did not reap the full benefits as did the valley’s residents, who had consumed the water since birth.\n\nChrysanthemums resemble *yiyi* flowers but are distinguished by taste—chrysanthemums are sweet, while *yiyi* are bitter, as the saying goes, \"bitter as *yiyi*.\" True chrysanthemums exist everywhere but are rare. They mostly grow near water, with the greatest abundance in Goushi and Lixian. The *Xian Fang* refers to the \"Essence of the Sun\" and \"Ever-Full,\" both names for a single chrysanthemum with differing roots, stems, flowers, and fruits. The descriptions are elegant, yet recent attempts at consumption have yielded no effect, precisely because true chrysanthemums were not obtained. If even Sweet Valley water, imbued with chrysanthemum essence, grants longevity to its residents, how much more so with superior herbs?\n\nMy late grandfather, the Vice Minister of Ceremonies, once served as magistrate of Linhang County. He recounted that the Liao family in the county had lived long lives for generations—some reaching a hundred, others eighty or ninety. After they relocated, their descendants suffered early deaths. When others occupied their former residence, longevity returned over generations. This suggested the house itself was the cause, though its reason was unknown. Suspecting the well water was unusually red, they excavated around it and unearthed several dozen *hu* of cinnabar buried by ancients a few feet away. The cinnabar’s essence had gradually seeped into the well, so drinking its water conferred longevity. How much more so if one refined and ingested cinnabar directly?\n\nI have also heard of Zhao Qu from Shangdang, who suffered from leprosy for years. Despite numerous treatments, his condition worsened, and death seemed imminent. His family, despairing, abandoned him in a mountain cave. Qu, lamenting his misfortune, wept day and night. After a month, an immortal passed by the cave, took pity on him, and inquired about his plight. Qu, recognizing the immortal’s extraordinary nature, kowtowed and pleaded for mercy. The immortal gave him a pouch of medicine with instructions for consumption. After a hundred days, Qu’s sores healed, his complexion became radiant, and his skin smooth as jade. The immortal revisited him, and Qu expressed gratitude for the gift of life, begging for the formula. The immortal replied, \"This is merely pine resin. This mountain abounds with it. Refine and consume it to attain immortality.\" Qu returned home, where his family, initially mistaking him for a ghost, were astonished. He then consumed pine resin continuously, his body growing lighter, his strength increasing a hundredfold. He could scale perilous heights and traverse rugged terrain all day without fatigue. At 170, his teeth remained intact, his hair unwhite. One night, he suddenly saw a light in his room, bright as a mirror. When he asked his attendants, they saw nothing. Over time, the light expanded until the entire room shone as if by daylight. Another night, he saw two tiny maidens, two or three inches tall, with fully formed faces and bodies, playing around his nose and mouth. After a year, the maidens grew larger and stood beside him. He often heard the sounds of zithers and lutes, laughing joyfully to himself. After over three hundred years among mortals, his appearance remained that of a youth. He then entered Baodu Mountain—undoubtedly an earthbound immortal.\n\nAt the time, news of Qu’s consumption of pine resin spread, and many rushed to gather it. The industrious transported it by cart and donkey, filling entire rooms. Yet most who consumed it stopped after a month, perceiving no significant benefit. Such perseverance is rare.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han, hunters in the Zhongnan Mountains encountered a person without clothing, their body covered in black hair. The hunters pursued them, but the figure leapt over gullies and valleys as if flying, impossible to overtake. The hunters then secretly observed their location, surrounded them, and captured them—only to discover it was a woman. When questioned, she said, \"I was originally a palace woman of Qin.\"",

He gathered a vast quantity of ritual tablets, rings, discs, and even the fittings of swords, intending to refine and ingest them. After I explained that these were unsuitable, he sighed and said, \"This matter cannot be approached without precision—not only is it futile, but it may even invite disaster.\"\n\nSilver, while inferior to gold and jade, may still confer earthbound immortality.",

      "translated_text": "Hearing that rebels from east of the Pass had arrived, the King of Qin went out to surrender. His palaces were set ablaze, and in terror, she fled into the mountains. Starving and with nothing to eat, she nearly died of hunger when an old man taught her to consume pine needles and pine nuts. At first, they tasted bitter, but gradually she grew accustomed to them, and thus she neither hungered nor thirsted, felt no cold in winter nor heat in summer. Calculating the years, this woman must have been a palace woman of Qin King Ziying, living until the reign of Emperor Cheng—over three hundred years. When brought back and fed grains, she first retched at the smell, vomiting for days before recovering. After about two years, her body hair fell away, and she grew old and died. Had she not been captured by men, she would surely have become an immortal.\n\nThe Wen family of Nanyang recounted that during the great chaos at the end of the Han, their ancestor fled into the mountains, starving and near death. Someone taught him to eat *zhu* (atractylodes), and thereafter he never knew hunger. After several decades, he returned to his hometown, his complexion youthful and his strength greater than before. He claimed that in the mountains, his body felt light, as if he could leap and bound over heights and perils, walking on ice and snow without feeling cold. He often saw a high cliff where several people sat—some playing board games, others reading. Leaning forward to observe, the Wen ancestor overheard them ask, \"Has this one reached the upper ranks yet?\" One replied, \"Not yet.\"\n\n*Zhu* is also called *shanji* (mountain thistle) or *shanjing* (mountain essence). The *Divine Elixir Classic* states: \"To attain longevity, one must constantly consume mountain essence.\" Formerly, the Eight Immortals each consumed a single substance to achieve earthly immortality, living for several hundred years before combining the divine elixir and golden liquor to ascend to the Great Clarity. If one were to combine and consume all eight substances, their power would not be realized, for the properties of these medicines counteract and restrain one another.\n\nHan Zhong consumed calamus for thirteen years, his body growing hair, and he could recite ten thousand words after reading them once. He never felt cold in winter. The calamus must grow on stone, be at least an inch long with nine or more nodes, and have purple flowers—this is especially effective. Zhao Tuo’s son consumed cinnamon for twenty years, and hair grew on the soles of his feet; he could walk five hundred *li* in a day and lift a thousand *jin*. Yi Menzi consumed schisandra for sixteen years, his complexion like jade, and he could enter water without getting wet or fire without being scorched. Chu Wenzi consumed rehmannia for eight years and could see at night as if by light, his hands strong enough to draw a crossbow. Lin Ziming consumed *zhu* for eleven years, and his ears grew five inches long; his body became light as flight, able to leap over ravines of twenty *zhang* or more. Du Ziwei consumed asparagus for eighty years, kept eighty concubines, and fathered one hundred thirty children; he could walk three hundred *li* in a day. Ren Ziji consumed poria for eighteen years, and immortals and jade maidens came to follow him. He could conceal and reveal himself at will, no longer ate grains, and his scars vanished, his face and body glowing like jade. Lingyang Zizhong consumed *yuanzhi* (polygala) for twenty years and fathered thirty-seven children; he never forgot what he read, whether sitting or standing.\n\nThe *Immortals’ Classic* states: \"Though one may consume the leaves of herbs and trees and live for several hundred years, if they neglect the divine elixir, they will ultimately fail to become immortals.\" From this, it is clear that herbs and plants merely extend life—they are not medicines of eternal life. Until one can refine the elixir, one may consume them to sustain oneself.\n\nSomeone asked whether there is a proper order for consuming medicinal substances. Master Baopu replied: \"According to the *Regimen for Consuming Medicines* by Master Zhonghuang: Take medicines for treating illness before meals, and those for nourishing life after meals. As for the golden elixir and great medicine, there is no need to discuss propriety.\"\n\nA single word on the palace:\n*Gengzi, Gengwu, Xinhai, Xinwei, Bingchen, Bingxu, Dinghai, Dingsi, Wuyin, Wushen, Jimao, Jiyou.*",

Knead it between the fingers until it becomes like clay; if it does not boil or fails to emerge between the fingers as clay, return it to the wine and smelt it repeatedly without count. When complete, take a pill the size of a bullet.

Take three *jin* of lard, one *dou* of pure bitter wine, and five *liang* of yellow gold.

      "translated_text": "*The Imperial Four Treasuries Edition*\n*Baopuzi, Inner Chapters, Scroll Three*\n*By Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty*\n\n**Disputation and Inquiry, Chapter Twelve**\n\nSomeone asked: If immortality must be attainable, then the sages would have already cultivated it. Yet neither the Duke of Zhou nor Confucius pursued it—this proves that no such Way exists.\n\nBaopuzi replied: The sage need not be an immortal, nor must the immortal be a sage. The sage receives his mandate when the Dao of long life is not at hand; his sole desire is to eliminate cruelty, expel bandits, level dangers, pacify violence, establish rites, compose music, enact laws, transmit teachings, reform perverse customs, correct degenerate mores, rescue imperiled rulers, and sustain failing states. He carves the *Odes* and *Documents*, compiles the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing*, authors classics and proclamations, harmonizes *Ya* and *Song*, instructs the young, and responds to summons from the feudal lords. Like smoke unfurling without pause, his mat never warms—his affairs press upon him, his tasks exhaust the years without end. How then could he close his ears, cover his eyes, turn his gaze inward, reverse his hearing, practice breath regulation, engage in Daoist gymnastics, maintain prolonged purity, enter water to pan for gold, ascend mountains to gather herbs, count his breaths, contemplate the spirits, abstain from grains, or purify his intestines?\n\nAs for immortals, they require only unwavering resolve, perfect faith, and unrelenting diligence. One who can embrace tranquility and stillness may attain it—no extraordinary talent is needed. Those lofty transcendents who descend into the world become but heavy burdens to Daoist practitioners.\n\nTo obtain and ingest the Great Elixir, to master the essentials of guarding the One and nurturing the spirit, is to achieve long life and enduring vision. How could this compare to the boundless endeavors of the sages as commonly understood?\n\nMoreover, the so-called \"sages\" of the world are sages of governing the age, not sages of attaining the Dao. The sages of attaining the Dao are Huang-Lao; the sages of governing the age are the Duke of Zhou and Confucius. The Yellow Emperor first governed the world, then ascended as an immortal—this was merely a rare case of one possessing both talents.\n\nOf the ancient emperors and kings who carved inscriptions on Mount Tai, seventy-two can be verified through reading, while the rest have eroded beyond count. Yet only the Yellow Emperor’s ascent to immortality is recorded—its authenticity is thus clearly established.\n\nThe world deems those who excel in what others cannot as \"sages.\" Thus, one unmatched in *weiqi* is called a \"chess sage\"—hence Yan Ziqing and Ma Suiming are still known today as chess sages. One peerless in clerical script is called a \"calligraphy sage\"—hence Wei Xie and Zhang Mo are still known today as calligraphy sages. One exceptionally skilled in carving is called a \"wood sage\"—hence Zhang Wei and Ma Zhong are still known today as wood sages.\n\nTherefore, Mencius called Boyi the sage of purity and Liuxia Hui the sage of harmony.",

      "translated_text": "Yi Yin is the sage of governance. Let me expound and argue that sagacity is not confined to a single endeavor. Ban Di was the sage of machinery, Fu Bian and Bian Que the sages of healing illness, Zi Wei and Gan Jun the sages of astrological divination, Shi Su and Xin Liao the sages of milfoil and turtle-shell divination, Xia Yu and Du Hui the sages of physical strength, Jing Ke and Nie Zheng the sages of courage, Fei Lian and Kua Fu the sages of swiftness, Zi Ye and Yanzhou the sages of musical discernment, Sun Wu, Wu Qi, Han Xin, and Bai Qi the sages of military strategy. Sagacity is the supreme designation for human affairs—it is not limited to literature alone.\n\nZhuang Zhou said: \"Bandits possess five aspects of the sage’s Way. To conjecture and know what others conceal is *ming*; to enter first without hesitation is *courage*; to withdraw last without fear is *righteousness*; to discern what is fitting is *wisdom*; to distribute spoils equally is *benevolence*. Without these, none could become the greatest bandit under heaven.\"\n\nSome may say: \"The sage’s Way cannot be divided into branches or scattered into leaves; it must be grasped in its entirety to be called sagacity.\" I reply: Among Confucius’ disciples, seventy-two attained mastery, each embodying a single facet of the sage—thus sagacity admits of division. It is also said: \"Yan Yuan possessed the whole but in miniature\"—thus sagacity admits of degrees. The *Yi* states: \"There are four aspects of the sage’s Way: in speech, one esteems its eloquence; in action, one esteems its adaptability; in crafting implements, one esteems their symbolic resonance; in divination, one esteems its omens.\" This is clear proof that the sage’s Way may be divided. Why, then, should those who excel in the Dao and attain immortality alone be denied the title of \"sage of the Dao\"? If there were no sages of the Dao, could Zhou and Kong be called sages of governance? Since sagacity is not singular, why demand that one person embody all its forms?\n\nThe immortal scriptures hold that those who attain transcendence are all born under the influence of the qi of immortality, naturally endowed with it. Even in the womb, they already harbor a predisposition toward the Dao. Once they gain consciousness, their hearts incline toward its practice, and they must encounter an enlightened master to receive its methods—otherwise, they will neither believe nor seek, and even if they seek, they will not obtain.\n\nThe *Jade Key Record* states that the origins of fate and the variations in human fortune—whether long or short—are determined at the moment of conception, when one receives the essence of the celestial lodges. Those aligned with the lodge of sagacity become sages; with the lodge of worthiness, worthies; with the lodge of literature, scholars; with the lodge of martiality, warriors; with the lodge of nobility, the noble; with the lodge of wealth, the wealthy; with the lodge of lowliness, the base; with the lodge of poverty, the poor; with the lodge of longevity, the long-lived; with the lodge of immortality, immortals. There are also lodges of divine immortals and sages, lodges of world-governing sages, lodges combining both, lodges of nobility without wealth, of wealth without nobility, of combined wealth and nobility, of wealth followed by poverty, of nobility followed by lowliness, of combined poverty and lowliness, of wealth and nobility unfulfilled, of loyalty and filial piety, of malevolence and wickedness—such variations cannot be exhaustively listed. The broad distinctions are as follows: a person’s life is fundamentally predestined, as Zhang Chezi’s teachings affirm.\n\nIf one is not fated to receive the mandate of immortality, one will not harbor a heart inclined toward transcendence. No one seeks what their heart does not desire, nor obtains what they do not seek. From antiquity to the present, there have been those of towering talent and profound understanding who disbelieved in immortals, and those of ordinary ability who studied and attained transcendence. Some, though discerning in many matters, may be blind to immortality; others, though less perceptive, may grasp its principles—is this not the work of heavenly mandate?\n\nDaoist lineages treasure and guard their transcendent arts, selecting disciples with utmost care and testing them over long years before imparting their essential secrets. How much less would they reveal these to the world at large, who neither believe nor seek? Why compel them to speak? Unable to transform others into believers, they would only invite ridicule and slander. Thus, those who attain the Dao differ from worldly people in their paths, their dwellings, their words, and their conduct. They keep a thousand *li* distant, fearing even that is insufficient to escape the assaults of gossip; they sever all traces, fearing even that is insufficient to avoid the shame of slander. Neither rank nor wealth can sway them—why would they ever proclaim to vulgar scholars, \"I possess the arts of immortality\"? This is why Zhou and Kong had no means to know the Way of transcendence.\n\nMoreover, Zhou and Kong were merely men of great talent and profound learning. Even in minor skills, they were often unversed. Had they been made to juggle balls, wield swords, leap over blades, toss daggers, walk tightropes, scale poles, pluck plates, climb tables, or cling to sheer cliffs a myriad *ren* high; to swim the unfathomable depths of Lüliang; to lift a thousand *jun* with their hands or tread upon whirlwinds; to grapple with caged tigers and leopards or catch flying arrows—even ordinary people could perform such feats, yet Zhou and Kong could not. How much less could they surpass these?\n\nWhat others contemplate—the orientation of fleas and lice, the colors behind walls, the grasses beneath trees, the texts in chests, the treasures buried in the earth, the birds and beasts in dense forests and deep marshes, the fish and turtles in vast abysses and torrential pools—had Zhou and Kong been made to discern their hues, distinguish their names, enumerate their quantities, and verify their presence or absence, they might not have known them all. How much less could they comprehend what lies beyond?\n\nSages grow hungry without food, thirsty without drink; they feel heat when scorched, cold when chilled, pain when struck, and injury when cut. With time, they age; with harm, they sicken; with the severing of *qi*, they die. In these ways, they differ little from ordinary people—their distinctions are few. What sets them apart lies only in their superior talent, far-reaching thought, eloquence, refined writing, complete virtue, pure conduct, rigorous instruction, and vast learning. How could they excel in every endeavor? Having already composed the *Dian* and *Mo* to pacify the realm and govern the people, why demand that they also master the Dao of transcendence and attain deathless longevity? To impose such expectations on sages is excessive.\n\nI have heard that profound words offend the ears of the vulgar, and truthful speech contradicts the crowd. Those who read this text will surely accuse me of slandering the sages. How could I? I merely exhaust the principles of things. When principles are exhausted and affairs fully explored, it may seem like disparagement of Zhou and Kong. Yet the world claims that sages descend from heaven as divine beings, omniscient and omnipotent—this is an extreme exaggeration.",
      "overlap_context": " others cannot as \"sages.\" Thus, one unmatched in *weiqi* is called a \"chess sage\"—hence Yan Ziqing and Ma Suiming are still known today as chess sages. One peerless in clerical script is called a \"calligraphy sage\"—hence Wei Xie and Zhang Mo are still known today as calligraphy sages. One exceptionally skilled in carving is called a \"wood sage\"—hence Zhang Wei and Ma Zhong are still known today as wood sages.\n\nTherefore, Mencius called Boyi the sage of purity and Liuxia Hui the sage of harmony.",

      "translated_text": "Those who revere the sages’ names dare not examine their deeds, claiming that what sages cannot do, no one else can, and what sages do not know, no one else knows. Is this not laughable? Let us now compare their actual deeds to awaken understanding.\n\nThe birds of Mount Wan sang their songs of life and death, yet Confucius did not know them—could one then say that Yan Hui could only partially comprehend them? When Confucius heard the weeping of a woman on Mount Tai and asked her cause, he learned that a tiger had devoured three of her kin, yet he did not understand why she had not moved away. Only upon questioning did he realize. When he saw hunters catching fledglings, he did not grasp their intent until asked. When he wished to bury his mother but did not know his father’s grave, he required guidance. Once the grave was set, its collapse again escaped his notice, and only after his disciples informed him did he weep in sorrow. When he suspected Yan Yuan of stealing food, he feigned a desire to sacrifice to his ancestors to test him, casting dust to expose the deception. When a stable burned, he did not know whether men or horses were harmed. Later, hearing that Yan Yuan had died, he declared it so. Though he wandered through seventy states, he could not foresee that none would employ him. Restless and hurried, his mat never warmed, yet he did not know the people of Kuang would surround him until he took that road. He asked Laozi about ancient rites but found some beyond his understanding. He inquired of Tanzi about the offices of birds but could not recognize them all. Traveling without knowing the ford, he sent others to ask, unaware that those he questioned would mock him and refuse to show the way—had he known, would he not have refrained from asking? When he alighted from his carriage to chase a man singing of the phoenix, he did not realize the man would not stay. Meeting Nanzi, he did not foresee it would bring no benefit. Such instances are too numerous to list, yet why should it be strange that he did not know the methods of transcendence?\n\nCommon scholars claim that what sages cannot do, no one else can. Yet Dan of the Marsh lived in water, Liang Mu transformed through fire, Zibo Zhan endured extreme cold, Zuo Ci escaped death through martial arts, Gan Shi fasted for years, Fan Ye remained unharmed when struck, the Turtle Decree revived the dead, Shao Qian grasped a hundred demons, Chang Fang shrank the earth’s veins, Zhong Fu took the form of a morning duck, and Zhang Kai summoned clouds and mist with his breath. Never have we heard that Zhou or Kong could perform such feats.\n\nSome say, \"Zhou and Kong could have done these things but chose not to.\" I reply: If one does not seek evidence in clear records but instead points to empty words, I could just as well claim that Zhou and Kong could spread their wings and soar to the eight directions, summon clouds and rain, or move mountains and shift wells—but they chose not to. Without written records as proof, what limits are there?\n\nIf this is the case, I could also say that Zhou and Kong both ascended as immortals, but they concealed this method lest the world know that deathlessness is attainable. If all abandoned their duties to pursue the Dao—forsaking official posts, risking peril, and venturing into the depths—then families would have no descendants, states no ministers or officials, loyalty and filial piety would vanish, and the great order would collapse. Thus, Zhou and Kong practiced in secret, revealing only the appearance of death while inwardly mastering the arts of transcendence. If so, how could you refute me? It may well be true.\n\nThe *Lingbao Sutra* contains the *Zhengji*, *Pingheng*, and *Feixian Shouzhi*—three scrolls of immortal arts. When the King of Wu quarried stone to build his palace, he found within the rock a book of purple script on golden tablets. Unable to read it, he sent an envoy to ask Confucius, who deceived him, saying, \"The King of Wu, in leisure, received a book delivered by a red sparrow to his hall. Unsure of its meaning, he seeks your counsel.\" Upon seeing it, Confucius declared, \"This is the *Lingbao* method, the Way of long life. Yu of Xia practiced it, dwelling in the watery realm, his years equaling heaven and earth, his court held in the Purple Palace. When Yu was about to transcend, he sealed it in a stone casket on a sacred mountain, and now the red sparrow has brought it—surely it is a gift from heaven.\" By this reasoning, Yu of Xia did not die, and Confucius knew of it. How can we be certain he did not secretly cultivate this Way?\n\nEven if sages did not practice such arts, one cannot say they lacked their effects. People’s likes and dislikes vary as widely as their faces—is this not true? What aligns with their inclinations, though small, they will pursue; what does not resonate with their spirit, though great, they will not learn. Some love bitterness and despise sweetness, while others crave profit and abandon righteousness—such cases are countless.\n\nThe greatest treasure of sages is rank; what draws people together is wealth. Riches and nobility are what all desire, yet in ancient times, some declined the abdication of imperial power, spurned the riches of the four seas, scorned the offices of the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers, and rejected jade and silk, choosing instead the lofty purity of mountains and forests, content with the humble life of fishing. Such examples are too many to count.\n\nIt is said that men and women, food and drink, are humanity’s greatest desires. Thus, some cannot be dissuaded from their love of beauty, nor can they forget their cravings for fine flavors. Yet in the past, there were those who abandoned grain, forsook delicacies, took no wives or concubines, wandered alone in enlightenment, spoke words of insight, delighted in their own reflection, rinsed their mouths with flowing water, and savored plain tastes—such cases are too numerous to recall.\n\nHuman nature cherishes rosy cheeks and graceful forms, yet the Yellow Emperor delighted in the homely Momu, and the Marquis of Chen loved the repulsive Dunqia. No nose dislikes fragrance, so why are liuhuang, yujin, orchids, musk, suhe, xuandan, sujiao, jiangli, jieche, spring orchids, and autumn orchids prized like jade and jasper? Yet the women of the sea follow men who reek of rancid odors, never tiring of them. No mouth dislikes sweetness, yet King Wen of Zhou preferred the unpalatable *kuai* to the rich flavors of the grand sacrifice. No ear dislikes music, yet Emperor Ming of Wei favored the sound of hammer and chisel over the harmony of strings and bamboo. Each person has their own inclinations—how can one demand that this be the same as that?\n\nZhou and Kong themselves did not believe in the Dao of transcendence. The sun and moon do not illuminate all things; sages do not know all things. To claim that what sages do not do, the world cannot do, is like blaming the three luminaries for not illuminating the inside of an overturned basin.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: On the Utmost**\n\nSomeone asked: \"Were the immortals of old all those who attained transcendence through study, or were they specially endowed with exceptional qi?\"\n\nThe Master Who Embraces Simplicity replied: \"What kind of question is this? None of them did not carry their satchels to follow teachers, accumulating merit through diligent effort. They endured frost and braved peril, combed by wind and washed by rain, personally sweeping and toiling. Only after proving their sincerity and conduct were they tested with hardship and adversity. Only those whose nature was steadfast and true, whose hearts held no resentment or doubt, were permitted to ascend the hall and enter the inner chamber. Some grew weary and halted midway; some became resentful and retreated; some were lured by glory and profit, returning to the ways of the common world; some were swayed by heterodox teachings, losing their resolve for detachment. Some expected success by evening after practicing in the morning; some sat in cultivation yet stood hoping for results. As for those who beheld wealth and beauty without their hearts wavering, or heard worldly words without their resolve faltering—among ten thousand, one such person is rare.\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus, those who strive are as numerous as ox hairs, while those who attain are as rare as unicorn horns. The archer who draws the bow exerts effort in loosing the arrow; the traveler who crosses the great river preserves his life only upon reaching the far shore. A well that does not reach the spring is as good as undug; a single step not taken is as good as never having set forth. The toils of the long road cannot be traversed in a single day’s watch, nor can the heights of the clouds be scaled by one basket of earth. Yet those who climb perilous peaks falter when near the summit, their strength failing; those who walk the Way fall ill when on the verge of completion, their resolve unfulfilled. A thousand granaries of grain are not the yield of one planting; a tree of a thousand feet does not grow in ten days. The unfathomable abyss begins with a trickle; the wealth of Tao Zhu was amassed over hundreds and thousands. Thus, when others retreat, one advances—this is how Yin Xi attained the utmost Dao. Reverent to the end as at the beginning—this is how Xian Men rode the clouds and dragons.

Most people, earning little yet spending much, still cannot make ends meet—how much less so for those with no income at all yet endless expenditures? None, young or old, are free from illness; it is only a matter of severity. Each receives qi in varying measure: those with much exhaust it slowly, while those with little deplete it swiftly. Those who know the Way replenish and restore themselves, first returning to their original state before seeking further benefits. If one were to consume elixirs for ten days, flesh would soar and bones ascend; if one practiced Daoist arts with each new moon, wings would sprout and feathers align—then the world would have no one who disbelieved in the Way.\n\nThe trouble lies in this: the meager benefits of a single ladle are not yet firm, yet the costs of bushels and tons are already guarded against; the roots’ hold is not yet deep, yet the poison of frost and snow assails them. Not recognizing that the fault lies within, one instead claims the Way is of no benefit—thus discarding pills and powders, abandoning breathing exercises. Therefore, it is not attaining long life that is difficult, but hearing the Way; not hearing the Way that is difficult, but practicing it; not practicing it that is difficult, but persisting to the end. A skilled craftsman can provide another with compass and square, but cannot ensure their mastery; a wise teacher can impart medical texts, but cannot guarantee their application. Cultivation is like sowing grain; completion is like harvesting it. Though the field be fertile and the water abundant, if one misses the season, neglects plowing and weeding, the crops will wither in the fields, unharvested and uncut. Though the acres be vast, there will be no yield.\n\nOrdinary people not only fail to recognize benefit as benefit, but also fail to recognize harm as harm. Harm is easy to know and swift; benefit is difficult to know and slow. If one does not grasp what is easy, how can one comprehend what is difficult? Harm is like the consumption of lamp oil—unseen, yet suddenly exhausted; benefit is like the growth of seedlings—unnoticed, yet suddenly lush. Therefore, in cultivating the body and nurturing nature, one must attend carefully to the smallest details. One cannot dismiss minor benefits as insignificant and neglect them, nor overlook minor harms as harmless and fail to guard against them. All great things arise from the accumulation of small things; a hundred million begins with one. If one cherishes the beginning and completes the end with diligence, then one has guarded the Way.\n\nSomeone asked: In ancient times, were there those who attained long life without any practice, merely by chance? The Master Embracing Simplicity replied: There were not. Some followed renowned teachers, accumulating merit and enduring hardship, and were thus granted completed elixirs; others received secret formulas and practiced them in seclusion, their deeds untouched by the world, their words unburdened by俗. Records preserve only their names, not the means by which they attained immortality—thus, such accounts are incomplete.\n\nOf old, the Yellow Emperor, born speaking, commanded a hundred spirits—one might call him naturally endowed by Heaven. Yet even he could not attain the Way by sitting idly. Thus, he ascended Wangwu Mountain to receive the cinnabar scriptures, journeyed to Dinghu to ascend on a flying pearl, climbed Kongtong to consult Guangcheng, and served Da Kui at Juci. He traveled to Mount Tai to honor Zhonghuang, entered Jingu to consult Hua Zi, discussed the cultivation of the Way with the two Xuan Su maidens, sought the precision of astronomy from Shan Ji and Li Mu, studied divination from Feng Hou, learned pulse diagnosis from Lei Qi, mastered warfare from the Five Tones’ defense, exposed hidden evils through the *Baize* records, surveyed geography through the *Qingniao* writings, and mended wounds with the arts of metallurgy. Thus, he encompassed all secrets, exhausted the Way, and fulfilled the truth, ascending on a dragon to the highest reaches, peerless with Heaven and Earth.\n\nYet the *Scriptures of Divine Immortals* all state that the Yellow Emperor and Laozi served the Great One, the Primordial Lord, to receive essential instructions. How much less could those inferior to these two lords attain immortality and transcend the world without such guidance? I have never heard of it.\n\nSomeone asked: If the Yellow Emperor truly attained immortality, why is there a tomb at Mount Qiao? The Master Embracing Simplicity replied: According to the *Classic of Mount Jing* and the *Record of the Dragon’s Return*, after the Yellow Emperor consumed the divine elixir, a dragon came to welcome him. His ministers, overwhelmed with longing, could not bear to part. Some took his mat and staff to establish a temple and make offerings; others took his robes and crown to bury and guard. The *Biographies of Divine Immortals* states that the Yellow Emperor chose his day of departure seventy days in advance. Seventy days later, he returned and was buried at Mount Qiao. Suddenly, the mountain collapsed, the tomb was empty, and only his sword and sandals remained. Though these accounts differ, they all affirm his attainment of immortality.\n\nThose who speak of the Yellow Emperor’s immortality appear frequently in Daoist texts and the sayings of the Hundred Schools, yet the Confucians, unwilling to entertain strange or extraordinary paths, focus solely on ritual and teaching. The affairs of divine immortals cannot instruct the common folk, so they claim his death to restrain the people’s hearts. Zhu Ba and Luan Ba rendered great service to the people, who built temples and made offerings to them in life. In ancient times, when men of great virtue passed away, their ministers carved their achievements on enduring monuments. Even today, when officials and people long for departed rulers and elders, they erect steles to praise their virtue—this is akin to the Yellow Emperor having temples and tombs. How does this prove he must have died?\n\nSomeone asked: Peng Zu lived eight hundred years, An Qi three thousand—these are lives surpassing others. If there truly is a Way of immortality, why did they not attain it? Is it not that their allotted lifespan and received qi had a fixed span, and they merely happened to live longer? In principle, it cannot be extended, so they could not escape decay and death.\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity said: ...",

      "translated_text": "Gezhi Ziyang responded: According to the *Pengzu Jing*, he served under Emperor Ku, assisted Yao, passed through the Xia dynasty, and became a grandee in Yin. The Yin king sent women to learn the arts of the bedchamber from him, and when they proved effective, sought to kill Pengzu to suppress his Way. Pengzu sensed this and fled, departing at the age of seven or eight hundred—this was not death. The *Huangshi Gong Ji* records that more than seventy years after Pengzu’s departure, his disciples saw him west of the Flowing Sands—clearly, he did not die. Moreover, Pengzu’s disciples—Qingyi Wugong, Heixue Gong, Xiumei Gong, Baitu Gong, Zililou Gong, Taizu Jun, and Gaoqiuzi Bukenlai—seven or eight in all, each lived for several hundred years in Yin before ascending as immortals. How could Pengzu himself have died? Furthermore, Liu Xiang’s *Liexian Zhuan* also states that Pengzu was an immortal.\n\nAs for Master Anqi, he sold medicines by the sea in Langye. Transmitted accounts say he had already lived a thousand years by the time Qin Shihuang summoned him for conversation, which lasted three days and nights. His words were lofty, his defenses profound, his learning vast and well-evidenced. Shihuang, astonished, bestowed upon him gold and jade worth tens of millions. Anqi accepted them, placing them at Fuxiang Pavilion, and left a pair of red jade shoes as repayment, along with a letter saying: “Seek me again on Penglai Mountain after several thousand years.” Thus, he was already a thousand years old when he met Shihuang—clearly, he did not die. Moreover, Shihuang was harsh and cruel, a man who ruled the world and would not have believed in immortals, nor would he have tolerated answers that displeased him. Yet when he questioned Anqi about the matter of longevity, Anqi’s responses were fitting, and Shihuang, awakening to the truth, came to believe that immortality must exist in the world. He bestowed generous gifts and earnestly desired to learn the art of deathlessness, but lacked an enlightened teacher. Deceived by the likes of Lu Ao and Xu Fu, he failed to attain it. Had Anqi’s words lacked substance, within three days and nights they would have been exhausted, and Shihuang would surely have boiled, roasted, or slaughtered him, sparing him no calamity of the cauldron. How then could he have received such lavish gifts?\n\nSomeone asked: If there are those who consume medicinal substances, practice qi circulation, and perform daoyin exercises, yet still cannot escape death, why is this?\n\nGezhi Ziyang answered: Those who do not obtain the golden elixir but only ingest herbal medicines or cultivate minor arts may prolong their years and delay death, but they cannot attain immortality. Some know only how to take herbs but not the essential techniques of rejuvenation—thus, they will never achieve long life. Others fail to understand how to wear spirit talismans, observe prohibitions, or guard the true unity within; they may only prevent illness, ward off wind and dampness, and avoid minor ailments. But if suddenly afflicted by malevolent ghosts, fierce demons, mountain spirits, water toxins, or other harms, they will die. Some do not know the methods for entering mountains, provoking mountain spirits to bring misfortune—demons test them, beasts injure them, ravine toxins entangle them, snakes and vipers sting them—leading to many deaths, each with its own cause. Others begin cultivation late in life, having already inflicted deep harm upon themselves, making recovery difficult. Even if they attempt to mend what is broken, the benefits are not yet consolidated when illness strikes again. How can such destructive practices lead to longevity?\n\nSome who take up the Way in old age attain immortality, while others who begin young fail—why is this? The former, though aged, received abundant qi at birth; with abundant qi, their injuries are shallow and easily healed, so they succeed. The latter, though young, received little qi at birth; with scant qi, their injuries run deep and are hard to heal, so they fail. Consider the hibiscus and willow: when cut and replanted, they revive whether upright or inverted, whether planted vertically or horizontally—no plant revives more easily. Yet if buried too shallowly or not long enough, if scraped or stripped, shaken or uprooted, even if nourished with rich soil and bathed in spring rains, they still wither and perish. Their roots are not firm, they cannot sprout new buds, their vital fluids fail to coalesce, and their life force cannot take form. The human body is easily harmed and difficult to nurture—far more so than these two plants. Yet the forces that assault it—scraping, stripping, shaking, uprooting—are even more severe. With little to sustain it and much to destroy it, death is only natural.\n\nThose who exhale the old and inhale the new rely on qi to grow, but when qi is greatly depleted, growth becomes difficult. Those who consume medicines rely on blood to replenish it, but when blood is nearly exhausted, replenishment is hard. Running and panting, coughing and choking, laboring the body and exhausting the spirit—these are signs of qi depletion. A dull complexion, withered skin, parched lips, pale veins, shriveled pores—these are signs of blood exhaustion. When these two signs decline externally, the spiritual root withers within. In such cases, even superior medicines cannot save them.\n\nThose who cultivate the Way yet fail, who manage their lives yet die—though they possess qi and blood, the root of what makes them qi and blood has already perished, leaving only its branches and streams. Like embers cast into water, the fire is extinguished, yet smoke does not immediately vanish; like a severed tree, its leaves may yet live. These are not without smoke or leaves, but what makes them smoke or leaves has already perished.\n\nPeople assume illness begins when symptoms appear, and death when breath ceases. They fear only wind, cold, heat, and dampness, unaware that these cannot harm the robust. Only those with weak bodies and scant qi cannot endure them and thus succumb. How to compare this? Suppose several people of the same age and similar health venture into the desert, braving a frigid night. Snow falls upon them, ice forms beneath, cold winds lash their limbs, and the night is filled with coughs and frozen spittle. Among them, some may fall ill from the cold, but not all—this is not because the cold favors some, but because some bodies cannot endure it. Likewise, when all eat the same food, some may fall ill from it—not because the food is inherently toxic, but because their constitutions differ. When drinking from the same vessel, some may become drunk while others remain sober—not because the wine’s potency varies, but because their tolerance differs. When exposed to scorching heat, some may die of heatstroke—not because the sun discriminates, but because their resilience differs.",

      "translated_text": "Taking the same medicine, some may alone grow drowsy, restless, and distressed—not because the drug’s potency harbors favor or spite. Thus, when a fierce wind rushes into the forest, the withered boughs are the first to snap; when a great wave crashes against the cliff, the rock embracing a fissure is the first to crumble; when wildfire sweeps the plain, the parched grasses are the first to burn; when a dragon bowl falls to the ground, the brittle ones alone shatter. From this we see that those without the bodily vessel of the Dao, already ailing in their fundament, are merely provoked by wind, cold, heat, or damp. If one can ensure that the upright qi does not decline and that form and spirit guard each other, nothing can harm them.\n\nGenerally, those who pursue the Dao fear beginning too late, not too early. Those who rely on their youthful vigor and robust strength overtax themselves, accumulating a hundred ailments until their lives hang by a thread, like morning dew. Even with potent medicine, merely consuming herbs and plants may restore them to the state of ordinary people, but cannot extend their allotted span. Thus the immortal classics say: “In nurturing life, not causing harm is the foundation”—this is the essential teaching. Shennong declared: “If the hundred diseases are not cured, how can one attain long life?” Truly so.\n\nSomeone asked: “Is what you call harm not found in excess and desire?” Baopuzi replied: “How could it be only that? Yet the essence of long life lies in the Way of Returning to Youth. The superior practitioner knows this and can thereby extend years and dispel illness; the next best does not harm himself. If one, though still young and strong, knows the Way of Returning to Youth, takes the Yin Elixir to replenish the brain, and gathers Jade Fluid from the long valleys, even without consuming medicinal substances, they will not fail to reach three hundred years—though they may not attain immortality. Those who do not grasp the method are like one who fills an ice cup with boiling water or wraps fire in a feather bundle.

      "translated_text": "Grief and sorrow wear one down; excessive joy and delight harm as well. Relentless pursuit of desires injures; prolonged talking and laughter injure. Sleeping and resting at improper times injure; drawing bows and pulling crossbows injure. Deep intoxication and vomiting injure; eating one’s fill and lying down immediately injure. Leaping and running until breathless injure; exultant shouts and bitter weeping injure. Lack of union between Yin and Yang injures. When accumulated injuries reach their limit, early death follows—early death is not the Way.\n\nThus, the methods of nurturing life are these: do not spit far, do not walk swiftly, do not strain the ears, do not gaze intently for long, do not sit to the point of exhaustion, do not lie down until fatigued. Dress before the cold becomes extreme, remove clothing before the heat becomes unbearable. Do not eat only when ravenously hungry, and do not eat to excess; do not drink only when parched, and do not drink too much. For overeating leads to stagnation and accumulations, while overdrinking forms phlegm and obstructions. Avoid extreme exertion and extreme indolence; do not rise late, do not sweat profusely, do not sleep excessively. Do not gallop on horseback or race in carriages, do not strain the eyes gazing into the distance, do not consume too much raw or cold food. Do not drink wine in the wind, do not bathe too frequently, do not harbor grand ambitions or distant aspirations, do not pursue strange and elaborate contrivances. In winter, do not seek extreme cold; in summer, do not pursue excessive coolness. Do not sleep exposed beneath the stars, do not sleep with shoulders bared in the night. Extreme cold, extreme heat, great winds, and thick fog—all should be avoided.\n\nThe five flavors entering the mouth should not be taken in excess: too much sourness harms the spleen, too much bitterness harms the lungs, too much pungency harms the liver, too much saltiness harms the heart, and too much sweetness harms the kidneys—this is the natural principle of the Five Phases. What is called \"injury\" is not immediately apparent; it means that over time, one’s lifespan is diminished.\n\nTherefore, those skilled in nurturing life rise and retire according to the seasons’ early and late hours, maintain regularity in their daily activities with perfect harmony, regulate and strengthen sinews and bones through proper postures, ward off illness and repel evil with techniques of swallowing and exhaling, circulate and harmonize the constructive and defensive qi with methods of supplementation and drainage, and balance labor and rest with the essentials of giving and taking. They restrain anger to preserve Yin qi and suppress joy to nourish Yang qi. Only then do they first take herbal medicines to remedy deficiencies, and later ingest the Golden Elixir to secure boundless longevity. The principle of eternal life is fully contained herein.\n\nIf one resolves to follow their inclinations, considering themselves enlightened and accepting of fate, dismissing heterodox teachings, indulging emotions and exerting strength without cultivating longevity—when such a person hears these words, they pass by like the wind.",

To expect their belief would be like offering a mirror to the blind or music to the deaf.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: Earnest Seeking**\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: The greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth is the generation of life, the cherishing of all things. Thus, the most guarded and revered secrets of the Daoist tradition are none other than the methods of attaining longevity. For this reason, blood-oath covenants are sworn before transmission, and the warnings of heavenly punishment are invoked. Even the former masters dared not lightly impart these teachings to others; only when a seeker’s devotion is most earnest should one carefully select the most sincere to instruct. How much less should one casually offer them to those who neither desire nor seek them, or who seek without wholeheartedness?\n\nThose who are not destined to attain immortality, even if they witness immortals thronging the world, will still insist that such beings are of a different kind, that they belong to another realm, or call them transformations of demons and sprites. Some may claim it was mere chance encounter. Who among them would acknowledge that immortality is the result of cultivation? If they do not believe, even if Red Pine or Wang Qiao were to speak to them directly, they would still point and call it heresy.\n\nYet even among those who recognize and believe, many falter in their inability to seek diligently for a true master. Those who comprehend the essentials and attain the genuine Dao are indeed rare, and cannot be found in haste. Still, those who know of it say only that such masters are few—not that they have vanished from the world. For those with the destiny for immortality, if they seek broadly and sincerely, they will inevitably encounter them. Yet while some seek and do not find, none have ever found without seeking.\n\nIn the world, there are countless deceivers who usurp the title of Daoist to swindle money. Yet even these will not admit to complete ignorance; they may feign some superficial understanding, falsely claim mastery, or adorn themselves with tricks to deceive. The gullible, unable to discern truth from falsehood, flock to them with questions, only to be misled. These frauds then restrict their followers, preventing them from seeking further, and declare, “The Dao is exhausted here.” How lamentable and infuriating that so many earnest seekers are thus led astray!\n\nOccasionally, one may encounter those who understand the refinement of the Five Clouds, the transmutation of the Eight Stones, the compounding of the Nine Elixirs, the alchemy of cinnabar and gold, the congealing of jade-like frost and snow in the divine crucible, or the gathering of lingzhi on Mount Song. Yet the many will slander them, saying, “Only Red Pine and Wang Qiao knew these methods. For modern men to claim such knowledge is sheer delusion.” The shallow-minded, failing to recognize the deceit in such words, abandon their far-reaching quests in despair. How sorrowful and sigh-worthy this is!\n\nTime flies like an arrow, swift as the wind; youth vanishes in an instant, and old age arrives with terrible speed. Nothing in the world compares to its haste. A lifespan of a hundred years is but thirty thousand days.",

      "translated_text": "Those who guard against weakness know nothing, while those who await decline and old age find all joy and pleasure abandoned. From the confusion of childhood to the senility of dotage, several decades pass in peril and distress, with sickness and sorrow ever at hand. Of the years one dwells in the world, barely half remain. Even if one lives a full century, the days of laughter and peace scarcely exceed fifty or sixty years—no more than six or seven thousand days of fleeting delight, sorrow, and senility. In the blink of an eye, they are gone. How much rarer still is one who attains a full hundred years? Reflecting earnestly, one can only pity those summer insects and morning mushrooms.\n\nTruly, this is the utmost sorrow of those who do not know the Dao. A common saying goes: \"Each day a person lives is a day lost, like driving cattle or sheep to the slaughter—every step brings death nearer.\" Though the comparison is crude, it holds truth. The enlightened do not grieve over death not because they do not seek life, but because they know no way to escape it. Thus, they say, \"Rejoice in Heaven and know fate, and so have no sorrow.\" It is not that they do not desire long life. The Duke of Zhou offered himself in place of King Wu, and Confucius dragged his staff in lament—even sages do not wish for swift death.\n\nYet common folk, seeing Zhuangzi’s metaphor of the great dream, rush to espouse the doctrine of equating life and death. These are cunning sophists, feigning detachment with words that defy restraint—precisely the kind Confucius sought to refute and punish. Observe those who speak thus: when struck by illness, they hastily seek acupuncture and moxibustion; when faced with mortal danger, they fear death intensely. Yet the prevailing custom dismisses truth, turning from the classics to the works of the Masters. Those who do not spout clever, paradoxical arguments are deemed rustic and unrefined, lacking the \"bone and marrow\" of Lao-Zhuang thought. Thus, the vulgar drift into baseless doctrines, unable to return to reason.\n\nLaozi made long life and enduring vision his pursuit, while Zhuangzi prized wagging his tail in the mud over being a sacrificial ox in embroidered robes, or starving while begging grain from the Marquis of He. From this, we know he could not truly equate life and death. Later scholars, failing to examine the truth, cling to a single phrase—is this not folly?\n\nMoreover, to descend into the Nine Springs, where the endless night begins, to become food for ants and worms, and finally merge with the dust—this thought sears the heart with dread. If one truly seeks life, how can one not abandon trivial matters and cultivate the wondrous arts? Those who do not believe may do as they please. But those who do believe yet fail to cast off worldly attachments, who cannot focus solely on nurturing life but dabble in cultivation only in the spare moments between worldly affairs—even if they attempt it, they often begin too late and rarely succeed.\n\nWhat most people covet is power, profit, and desire. Yet if one’s body is not whole, even high office, vast wealth, mountains of gold and jade, or countless beauties are not truly one’s own. Thus, the superior person first attends to the matter of long life. Once long life is secured, all desires can be fulfilled at will. If one has not yet ascended to the realm of the immortals, one may at least become an earthbound immortal, dwelling among men like Pengzu or Laozi, living for centuries without losing the joys of human existence. Then, one may gradually ascend—this, too, is a grand achievement. Yet one must find a worthy teacher; without sufficient devotion, success is impossible.\n\nIn former times, the Empress Dowager of Han studied the *Book of Documents* under Xiahou Sheng, rewarding him with a hundred catties of gold and countless treasures. Upon his death, she bestowed two million coins upon his family and mourned him for a hundred days. When Emperor Cheng was heir apparent, he studied the *Analects* under Zhang Yu. After ascending the throne, he enfeoffed Yu as Marquis Within the Pass, granted him a fief of a thousand households, and appointed him Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, bestowing a hundred catties of gold. Later, when Yu was promoted to Chancellor and advanced to the rank of Marquis of An, he begged retirement in his old age. The emperor granted him a carriage drawn by four horses and a hundred catties of gold, along with tens of thousands of coins. When Yu fell ill, the emperor personally visited and knelt at his bedside. When Emperor Zhang was heir apparent, he studied the *Classic of Filial Piety* under Huan Rong. After ascending the throne, he appointed Rong Grand Master over the Masses. The emperor visited Rong’s residence, allowing him to sit facing east with a table and staff, while officials and hundreds of Rong’s disciples attended. The emperor personally held the texts and lectured. He enfeoffed Rong as Marquis Within the Pass with a fief of five thousand households. When Rong fell ill, the emperor visited his home, dismounting at the alley entrance and hurrying forward with the scrolls in his arms, like a disciple. When Rong passed, the emperor donned mourning garb.\n\nNone of these men achieved merit through conquering cities, battling in the wilds, breaking enemy formations, or expanding the realm—through deeds of valor or exploits in distant lands. They merely transmitted the teachings of a single classic, expounding its phrases, yet were honored so grandly. These were but empty words about the dead. Even emperors, in their exalted position, humbled themselves to serve such teachers. Yet in the world today, those who wish to cultivate the Dao of long life refuse to humble themselves before a worthy master, trampling upon propriety in their haste to seek the essentials. How can they possibly succeed?",

      "translated_text": "Scholars may bow in reverence and run errands in service—what benefit do such trifling acts bring to their teacher? Yet without them, their hearts remain unyielding. If their hearts remain unyielding, even when instructed, they will not apply themselves fully. If they do not apply themselves fully, how can they possibly obtain the secret essentials in their entirety? At best, they may be shown superficial techniques—how could these suffice to achieve the work of immortality?\n\nThere are also those whose fair complexion and pleasing appearance inspire trust, yet their devotion to the Dao is not rooted in the heart. Their spirits seek only to extract something. Outwardly, they feign deep reverence, but within days, their negligence becomes apparent. Should they encounter a discerning teacher, he may wish to observe their intentions closely. Testing them with prolonged delay and withholding instruction to gauge their resolve, such people will reveal their true nature—deception and falsity. Even if taught, they will not receive the full transmission, nor will they speak with sincerity. If their words are not sincere, teaching them is of no benefit.\n\nChen Anshi was but thirteen years old, a mere retainer in Guan Shuben’s household. Having first attained the immortal Dao, Shuben—though seventy years of age with a head of white hair—bowed morning and night to Anshi, saying: “The Dao is noble, and virtue is esteemed; he who first attains the Way is the teacher. I dare not grow weary in upholding the rites of a disciple.” Thus, Anshi revealed to him the essential methods, and Shuben, too, ascended as an immortal.\n\nMan receives his spirit first from Heaven and Earth, then his qi and blood from his parents. Yet without a enlightened teacher to instruct him in the Dao of transcending the world, he has no means to escape death.

      "translated_text": "Ge Hong said: The ancients were plain and valued deeds over words. Thus, those who governed did not esteem rhetorical flourish, and those who cultivated the Dao did not exalt eloquent discourse. As customs declined and shallowed, external adornments grew ever more elaborate. The barriers of formal learning piled high like mountains at the gates of the Confucians, while the inner scriptures were likewise scattered and neglected among the masters of esoteric arts. Beginners could not be immediately entrusted with essential teachings, and human nature, moreover, finds greater delight in abundance of beginnings and ends. Thus, later adepts of the Dao—such as Gan Ji, Rong Song, and Gui Bo—each composed works numbering in the thousands of chapters. Yet these were largely admonitions and exhortations, unwilling to reveal the great guiding principles and ultimate aims.\n\nThe true oral instructions for attaining the Real might be transmitted only by word of mouth or written on no more than a foot of silk, concealed within the folds of one’s collar. Without long and arduous training under a master, without enduring trials and tests, one could not obtain them. Even among the motley disciples, each was taught according to the depth of their devotion, the length of their suffering, the reach of their intelligence, and the capacity of their talents. Over a thousand years, only a few ever exhausted the secrets hidden in their master’s pillows or sleeves.\n\nSome were merely given prepared elixirs to share, sufficient to grant them immortality, yet the masters never transmitted the written methods. Thus, among the Daoist adepts of the world, not one in ten thousand knows the art of the Golden Elixir. Yet the shallow and narrow-minded assume that the methods of immortality must lie in voluminous texts or in the rituals of sacrifice and prostration. Long life and mastery of destiny do not come from offerings and prayers.\n\nIn the Qin and Han dynasties, great sacrifices were made to Taiyi, the Five Spirits, Chenbao, the Eight Immortals, and others, expending cattle, sheep, grain, silk, and coin by the millions—all to no avail. How much less can a common man, whose virtue is incomplete and whose body is untended, hope to extend his years by offering the three sacrificial animals, wine, and delicacies, beseeching the gods with prayers? Such delusion is profound.\n\nSome well-meaning enthusiasts, though earnest in their desire for the Dao, fail to diligently seek out renowned masters or compound rare elixirs. Instead, they spend their days reciting and expounding thousands of useless volumes, gaining nothing in old age. They conclude that immortality is but a myth, or they prostrate themselves in empty rooms, slaughter animals, burn incense, and pray for blessings—yet the sick are not healed, deaths follow one after another, fortunes are squandered, and not a single effect is achieved. They never repent, blaming only their own lack of devotion. Had they applied such diligence to seeking a master, had they spent such wealth on purchasing elixirs and secret arts, they would surely have attained transcendence and long life, escaping the world. What difference is there between this and plowing a stony field in old age, hoping for a thousand granaries’ harvest? Though their labor is great, they do not grasp the proper means. It is like setting out for Chu but taking the road to Yan: though the horse may be swift, it will not arrive, not because it does not run fast, but because it has lost the Way.\n\nSome are credulous by nature and too ready to trust others. Their intelligence is insufficient to discern truth from falsehood, to gauge depth from shallowness. Their learning is narrow, and they cannot appraise things. When they chance upon someone who praises himself—saying, “I possess secret texts”—they cling to him and serve him. Yet many of these are vulgar men or mere children who falsely assume the name of a Daoist adept, their reputations exceeding their true worth due to boasting and deceit. Greedy and impure, they seek only profit. When asked for teachings, they force out vague sounds, nodding and bowing, raising and lowering their voices as if guarding profound secrets that cannot be revealed. If pressed, they smile and promise to disclose them later. Thus, students cannot bear to leave, believing their devotion insufficient and their gifts too meager. Their faith grows ever more reverent; they offer pearls and treasures, perform the labors of servants, carry heavy burdens over great distances, endure hardships and dangers, hoping to prove themselves through accumulated toil and suffering, to gain some rare insight. Yet the years pass in vain, their parents’ support squandered, their wives and children neglected. They tread frost and ice, following their master year after year, wasting their resources and strength, achieving nothing in the end.\n\nAt first, the master may have deceived them; later, he may feel shame, but his body is empty, his knowledge exhausted, his abilities too meager to teach. What method can he use to perfect others? I have seen no fewer than ten or twenty such men. Some style themselves with lofty names, lingering in the world for ages; others claim to be three or four hundred years old, merely changing their names to pose as sages among men. Many have followers who serve them. I do not deign to record their names.\n\nI have traveled among the common folk, where the unlearned cannot distinguish truth from falsehood. They praise and exalt such men, amplifying their deceptions. The cunning and false gain empty fame, and their influence spreads, for none can discern the truth. Even the wise may occasionally let down their guard, relying only on their ears, and thus mislead later students. Such cases never fail to evoke sighs.\n\nI have seen these charlatans deceive the world to gain power and profit, and though their punishment may be slow, Heaven’s net is wide but not leaky. Yet it is the earnest seekers they mislead who are most pitiable.\n\nPeople of the world often chase empty reputations, rarely examining the facts. When they hear that so-and-so has many disciples—sometimes a hundred or more—they assume there must be something extraordinary about him. They rush to join, gathering in crowds to serve him, wasting their time and effort in reverence of such ignorant men. They do not investigate further, nor do they realize that the master’s disciples may have gained wealth or eloquence through their service, yet after years of devotion, they have not attained the Dao. Foolish men do not understand that such a master is unworthy of service, nor do they awaken to this truth. How tragic!\n\nTo search for a foot-tall mound in a mountain’s expanse, to seek a tree that reaches the sky, to strain for a whale that swallows boats from a cow’s hoofprint—though one may spend a lifetime at it, how can one succeed? Alas! Future students, though they must make seeking a master their duty, must also take care to choose wisely.\n\nThe narrow-minded, whose conduct is shallow, whose virtue is thin, whose merits and deeds are few, cannot perfect others in the Dao, nor can they repay the profound debt owed to their teachers. Reflect deeply on this, lest your efforts be in vain.\n\nGe Hong said: These Daoists of empty reputation are skilled in deception, misleading students. Many are short on talent and ashamed of their ignorance. Outwardly, they pretend to have studied enough, never willing to seek instruction from those greater than themselves. Like fools, they stand facing a wall, not merely silent but resenting and slandering those who truly possess the Dao, fearing that their own reputations will be eclipsed.",

      "translated_text": "Such men—do they truly seek the methods of longevity? Their aim is only to gather disciples and exploit their wealth and strength to gratify their own desires. Yet they do not realize how Heaven discerns high and low; their end will surely bring calamity.\n\nThe poor must not falsely claim to be rich, nor the lowly pretend to be noble. How much less should those who possess no true attainment in the Dao’s arts yet keep disciples and students on empty pretenses? Even ordinary people should not harbor envy toward the good—how much more should Daoists, whose very lives depend on loyalty, trust, and open-heartedness? How can they allow such arrogance to fester in their breasts?\n\nMen cannot perceive the divine, yet the divine perceives them with ease. What difference is there between this and standing outside a gauze curtain, unable to see what lies within the chamber, yet acting with such haughty indifference, assuming no one sees them? It is no different from the thief who, hearing the clamor of the bell he strikes, covers his own ears to avoid detection—yet the deaf and blind remain within him.\n\nThose who covet fame, monopolize glory, and gather followers for show, seeking reputation abroad and profit at home, resenting anyone greater than themselves—such rivalry exceeds even the worldly struggle for power and influence. They wield their lips and tongues like blades, using slander and praise to form factions. Outwardly, they feign closeness; inwardly, they are distant. Their faces show harmony, but their actions betray division. They speak of shared purpose in the open, yet secretly harbor the venom of wasps and scorpions. This is what both Heaven and men despise, the very writ that summons disaster.\n\nEven those who study the Five Classics should not be ashamed to seek instruction from inferiors to cultivate virtue and refine their learning, daily advancing in brightness. As for archery, charioteering, basic skills, simple calculations, humble tasks of farming and weaving, or minor arts of measurement—all require a teacher to master their principles. How much more so for the methods of nurturing longevity, which extend years and preserve life? This is no different from rescuing someone from the brink of death. How can one cling to the shame of seeking instruction, enduring lifelong ignorance, never changing even in old age, never repenting even at death? Such are the truly benighted among Heaven’s people.\n\nThose who witness this should feel shame and dread on their behalf, yet the perpetrators themselves remain oblivious, heedless of their own reflection. Even Confucian scholars must steadfastly guard simplicity, outwardly embracing plainness, knowing as if not knowing, possessing as if not possessing, so that common fools cannot exhaust their praise. When questioned, they do not answer at once but respond only after yielding in deference. How is it that those who claim to be Daoists so stubbornly pretend to know what they do not, to possess what they lack, vainly flaunting themselves to pursue ill-gotten gains?\n\nThose who stray and do not turn back only sink deeper, as if some force compels them. One can only assume they feel no shame in their conduct. I do not speak these words lightly but out of genuine concern, for I cannot remain silent in the face of such affliction.",

As the *Baopuzi* states: If a man condemned to death could be saved, none would begrudge the toil or humiliation, nor shrink from humble entreaties, for the merit of preserving life is assured. Now, the rabble of miscellaneous Daoists, failing to attain the Great Elixir and the supreme method, will surely never achieve longevity—this is self-evident. Though they may cure illnesses with effects akin to raising the dead, though they may fast for years without hunger, summon spirits at will, vanish or appear at whim, gaze a thousand *li* afar, discern others’ rise and fall, dispel hidden afflictions, and foresee fortune or misfortune before it sprouts, all this avails nothing for their own lifespan. Yet they still feel shame in seeking instruction, disdain serving those who have gone before, cling to a moment’s pride, and willingly embrace eternal mediocrity—such are those blind to the weight of matters.\n\nThe ancients said: \"Life’s benefit to me is vast indeed.\" In terms of its worth, though one were enthroned as emperor, it could not compare to this method. In terms of its weight, though one owned all under heaven, it could not equal this art. Thus arose the parable of the dying king who envied the living rat.

      "translated_text": "Those who cling to the hollow fame of brief deficiency and feel shame at the temporary toil of seeking a teacher—though they claim not to be foolish, I do not believe it. Suppose a man were spared certain death only to face execution: he would still rejoice in shedding a heavy burden for a lighter one, in escaping searing agony to preserve his breath, and would endure such suffering as greater than rebirth. Yet people remain unashamed of their ignorance only because they do not know the day of their death. If they truly knew it, and could delay mutilation by even a short time, they would surely do so. How much more, then, should they willingly perform menial tasks—sweeping floors, holding towels, exerting themselves for those greater than themselves—to be taught the Way of not dying? What hardship is there in this that the blind fear it?\n\nIf a man were ashamed to run swiftly to escape a wildfire, or too proud to flee the wind only to drown in deep waters, the world would surely call him witless. Yet all know to mock those who do not avoid disaster, while none wonder why they do not fear calamity. Why is this?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* says: Many have written books on the Dao in the past, yet none have avoided the pursuit of florid, clever words to embellish empty profundities. None have thoroughly examined the steps to long life, or sharply diagnosed the ailments of the Way, as diligently as I have. My true aim is to guide the lost back to the path, to recover what was lost in the east at the mulberry groves, to draw the rope for those fallen into the well before they sink entirely. But those who nurture perilous illness and reject bitter medicine—what can be done for them?\n\nWho is without fault? To err and then correct it is like the sun and moon eclipsed yet shining again, like Yan Hui. I also wish to ensure that future seekers of the Way of life choose their teachers wisely. Thus, I offer my most sincere counsel without adornment or extravagant words. My words are direct, my brush unflinching, my pain at the thought of long life thwarted, and my restraint of deceit—what more is there to seek?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* says: I deeply consider that those who study the arts of the Dao and cultivate life often follow teachers unworthy of the task, achieving nothing in the end. This leads later aspirants, seeing their failure to attain long life, to conclude that immortality is impossible. Those who wish to transcend life but refuse to discipline the body or restrain the self in pursuit of the wondrous and subtle will advance only to lose the means of seeking office, and retreat without the merit of delaying old age. They harm themselves within and discourage others without.\n\nAttaining immortality through study is as certain as sowing millet or grain—its success is plain to see. Yet no one reaps fine harvests without plowing, nor gains long life and transcendence without diligence.\n\n**Miscellaneous Responses, Chapter Fifteen**\n\nSomeone asked: \"Can abstaining from grain lead to long life? Among all methods of restraint, which is the best?\"\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replied: Abstaining from grain can only reduce the expense of food; it cannot alone grant long life. Those who have fasted for long periods say they suffer fewer illnesses than when eating grain. Consuming *Atractylodes* or *Polygonatum*, or *Yu yu liang*, twice daily over time increases strength, allowing one to bear burdens and travel far without fatigue. Those who take mineral elixirs and maintain them for ten or five years, or swallow qi, consume talismans, or drink divine water, merely stave off hunger—their bodies cannot endure labor.\n\nThough Daoist texts say, \"To attain long life, the intestines must be pure; to achieve immortality, the intestines must be free of residue,\" and claim, \"Those who eat grass run swiftly but are foolish; those who eat meat are strong but fierce; those who eat grain are wise but short-lived; those who eat qi are spiritually enlightened and do not die\"—these are but the biased views of qi-practitioners and cannot be relied upon alone.\n\nIf one wishes to take the golden elixir or great medicine, it is best to fast for a hundred days first. If unable, one may take it directly, though attaining immortality will be slightly delayed—there is no great harm. In times of famine or hardship, those who know this method of abstaining from grain can avoid starvation in the mountains and forests. Otherwise, there is no urgent need to fast, as the benefits are not substantial. Moreover, those who abruptly cut off meat may still crave rich, fresh flavors. For those who have not yet left the worldly life, abandoned their families, or dwelled in mountain caves, it is better not to force abstinence from grain. Instead, one should regulate hunger and satiety.\n\nThere are now over a hundred methods: some involve taking dozens of mineral elixir pills to avoid hunger for forty or fifty days. Refining pine, cypress, or *Atractylodes* can also sustain one, though not as effectively as great medicines, and the effects last no more than ten years. Some methods allow one to fast for a hundred or two hundred days, while others require daily consumption to stave off hunger. Some involve eating a lavish meal first, then taking medicine to preserve the food, preventing digestion and allowing one to fast for three years. To return to eating grain, one must take *Malva* seeds with lard to purge the undigested food, which will pass unchanged.\n\nIn Luoyang, the Daoist Dong Wei and others at the White Society never ate. Chen Zixu served and studied under them for a long time before obtaining their method. It involves grinding over ten ingredients—such as licorice, *Saposhnikovia*, and *Gleditsia* pods—into a powder. One first takes a square-inch spoonful, then swallows twelve stone pellets the size of sparrow eggs, which suffice for a hundred days. When the time comes, one takes the powder again, and strength and complexion remain unchanged. To return to eating grain, one must drink a *Malva* seed decoction to expel the stones before eating.\n\nThere is also the method of using \"Red Dragon’s Blood\" and \"Blue Dragon’s Paste\" with cinnabar, malachite, and water to soften stones, which can then be eaten. If not consumed immediately, they dissolve completely. Eating these stones to satiety strengthens the body.\n\nAnother method is the \"Stone-Drawing Powder\": a square-inch spoonful is added to a *dou* of white stones and boiled in water until tender, like taro, to replace grain. Zhang Taixuan and his family, along with dozens of disciples, lived in Linlü Mountain and ate stones this way for over ten years, remaining robust. However, this requires white stones, unlike the \"Red Dragon’s Blood\" and \"Blue Dragon’s Paste\" methods, which can use any stone but require firewood for boiling.\n\nSome use talismans, some water, some both. Others eat nine jujubes daily with one or two *sheng* of wine. Some consume the twelve *shi* of qi, starting at midnight, counting down from nine nines to five fives. In spring, they face east to ingest the green qi of Jupiter into the liver; in summer, they take the red qi of Mars into the heart; in the three months of each season, they consume the yellow qi of Saturn into the spleen; in autumn, they take the white qi of Venus into the lungs; in winter, they ingest the black qi of Mercury into the kidneys.\n\nThe Daoist Qie Yuanjie of Mount Song consumed the essence of the six *wu* days, which was highly effective. For example, during the ten-day period of *jiazi*, if the essence of *wuchen* is present, one faces the direction of *chen* and swallows qi for the entire ten days. When the next *jia* day arrives, one turns to the *wu* of that period.",

      "translated_text": "The method of Gan Shi involves summoning the Jade Maidens of the Six *Jia* and Six *Ding*, each with their own names, and reciting incantations over water before drinking it—this can even render cattle and horses free from hunger. Alternatively, one may meditate on the spirit within the spleen, named Yellow Skirt Child, and by closing the mouth, ingest internal *qi*. All these methods yield genuine results. I have personally witnessed many who practiced grain avoidance for two or three years, their bodies light, complexions radiant, and resistant to wind, cold, heat, and dampness. Most were not stout.\n\nThough I have not seen those who abstained from grain for decades, it is certain that ordinary people cannot survive beyond ten days without food. Yet those who have practiced this for years remain unharmed—how could one doubt its long-term efficacy? Those who attempt grain avoidance often fear they cannot endure, but when questioned, practitioners all report initial weakness followed by gradual strength, improving month by month and year by year. Thus, it is indeed sustainable.\n\nThose who attain longevity and the Dao invariably do so through consuming elixirs and ingesting *qi*—this is no falsehood. However, those who take elixirs or abstain from grain typically experience extreme emaciation at first. Those who use talismanic water or solely ingest *qi* grow fatigued and thin within forty days, but thereafter regain vigor.\n\nMaster Zheng said, \"By nature, I did not drink much wine. Once, while dwelling in Copper Mountain, I abstained from grain for over two years and could drink several *dou* of wine without intoxication. From this, one may infer that fasting enhances resistance to toxins, which in turn makes one less susceptible to illness.\" I then asked how he obtained wine in the mountains. Master Zheng replied, \"First, brew fine cloud-liquid without pressing or straining. Then, mix it with powdered cinnamon, aconite, licorice, and five or six other ingredients, form them into pills, and dry them in the sun. Dropping one pill the size of a chicken’s egg into a *dou* of water instantly produces fine wine.\"\n\nThere is also the Yellow Emperor’s method for Cloud-Liquid Springs: combine sprouted rice with seven or eight medicinal ingredients, and add one *sheng* to a vessel of water—like the water infused with thousand-year-old vinegar—never depleting, its flavor always excellent and unchanging, greatly benefiting those who drink it.\n\nThough talismanic water and grain avoidance may initially cause emaciation, they are advisable when combined with proper knowledge. In times of sudden famine, when there is no time to prepare elixirs, talismanic water is the superior choice.\n\nThere was a man named Feng who solely ingested *qi* and abstained from grain for three years. I observed him climbing mountains while carrying a load of over one *hu*, walking all day without fatigue. Occasionally, he drew his bow but spoke little, and when he did, he refused to raise his voice. When asked why, he said, \"Abstaining from grain depletes essence and expends *qi*—speaking loudly is the greatest taboo.\"\n\nI have also repeatedly seen shallow Daoists who, seeking to feign marvels and gain fame for fasting, in truth know nothing of the Way. They merely pretend to avoid porridge and rice while secretly consuming wine by the *dou* at midday, along with dried meats, preserved fruits, dates, chestnuts, and eggs—never ceasing to eat. Some devour large quantities of meat, swallowing the juices and spitting out the dregs, consuming dozens of *jin* in a day. This is nothing more than crafting fine cuisine.\n\nOrdinary wine drinkers who consume dried meats and forgo grain can endure half a year or even a full year without distress—yet this cannot be called grain avoidance.\n\nIn Wu, the Daoist Shi Chun practiced *qi*-ingestion to treat illnesses. He would wait until the patient recovered—sometimes a hundred days, sometimes ten—before eating. When Emperor Jing of Wu heard of this, he remarked, \"This cannot last; he will surely die of hunger.\" He summoned Chun, locked him up, and had him closely guarded. Chun requested only three or four *sheng* of water daily. Over a year passed, and his complexion grew even more radiant, his strength undiminished. When the emperor asked if he could endure for a long time, Chun replied, \"There is no limit—I could go for decades, fearing only old age, not hunger.\" The emperor then released him.\n\nJudging by Chun’s case, it is clear that grain avoidance cannot extend lifespan. Even today, some practice Chun’s method.\n\nWhen asked about the method to resist cold, *Baopuzi* said: \"On the day of the Beginning of Winter, consume the talismans of the Six *Bing* and Six *Ding*, or close the mouth and circulate the *qi* of the Five Fires one thousand two hundred times—this will prevent cold for the entire twelfth month. Alternatively, drink Solar Wine, take the Purple Quartz Rice-Lacquer Powder, or first consume one Male Pill followed by two Female Pills (in another version, first Female then Male)—these can also endure a day and night without cold.\"\n\nThe Female Pill uses orpiment, azurite, *bin*-stone, and magnetite.\nThe Male Pill uses realgar, cinnabar, and chalcanthite.\n\nHowever, these offer no benefit to longevity.\n\nWhen asked about the method to resist heat, *Baopuzi* said: \"On the day of the Beginning of Summer, consume the talismans of the Six *Ren* and Six *Gui*, or circulate the *qi* of the Six *Gui*, or take the Black Water (or Ice) Pills, or the Flying Frost Powder. However, the latter requires the bark of trees from Mount Xiaoqiu and the blood of a black snake traveling north at noon on the fifth day of the fifth month—few have succeeded in preparing it. Only Fang Bozi and Wang Zhongdu could wear heavy furs in summer, stand in the midday sun surrounded by twelve braziers, and neither complain of heat nor sweat—undoubtedly, they used this method.\"\n\nWhen asked about the method to repel weapons, *Baopuzi* said: \"I heard that Emperor Wen of Wu once received essential teachings from Master Jie, who said that merely writing the characters for the Northern Dipper and the sun and moon would render one unafraid of blades. The emperor tested this on dozens of his attendants, who led charges and plunged into battle, yet none were harmed for life.\"\n\nMaster Zheng said, \"Simply reciting the names of the Five Weapons also proves effective. The sword is named Great Chamber and governed by the Void Star; the halberd is named Crooked Tension and governed by the Root Star; the arrow is named Wandering and governed by Mars; the blade is named Great Wound and governed by the Horn Star; the crossbow is named Distant Gaze and governed by the Spread Star; the shield is named Great General and governed by the Three Stars.\"\n\nBefore battle, one should quietly recite these names. Alternatively, on the fifth day of the fifth month, create the Red Spirit Talisman and wear it over the heart; or on the day of *bingwu* at noon, make the Swallow Lord and Dragon-Tiger Double-Pouch Talismans, replacing the yearly talisman annually, the monthly talisman monthly, and the daily talisman daily. One may also wear the Talisman of the Messenger of Military Trust of the Queen Mother of the West, the Talisman of Mars and the Vermilion Bird, the Talisman of the Southern Culmen and Melting Metal, or the Talismans of Repelling Blades and Zhurong. Alternatively, apply the Jade Tablet Powder, bathe in forbidden onion broth, or use the male chaste tree to create the Six Yin Spirit Generals Talisman, pointing it toward the enemy. Or, during a lunar eclipse, carve the blood of a three-thousand-year-old toad (which has eight characters under its throat) onto the blade one wields. One may also carry the Martial Might Talisman, the Firefly Fire Pill, or when blades clash, tread on the *kui* and *fang* stars while invoking the Lords of the Four Directions—all of which have proven effective. Even today, some possess the method to repel weapons.\n\nWhen asked about the method of vanishing, *Baopuzi* said: \"The divine Way has five postures, but their number is lost to obscurity.\"",

For example, during the ten-day period of *jiazi*, if the essence of *wuchen* is present, one faces the direction of *chen* and swallows qi for the entire ten days. When the next *jia* day arrives, one turns to the *wu* of that period.",

      "translated_text": "Yet these methods offer no benefit to the affairs of longevity and destiny. If practiced idly among men without cause, they invite only rumors of the uncanny and strange—such practices are not to be recklessly pursued. They may, however, be prepared for times of war and peril, employed in extremity to avert disaster.\n\nMaster Zheng said: \"Wearing the Great *Lü* Talisman for ten days, one may vanish by turning left or appear by turning right.\" Alternatively, one may apply the Jade *Yan* Pill to the body, use the Snake’s Foot Powder, carry the Mother of Separation Grass, or break the Green Dragon Grass to subdue the Six *Ding* Spirits. One may enter a bamboo field and grasp the Great Pivot’s soil, or construct a Stone Chamber of the River Dragon and vanish beneath the cloud canopy’s shade. One may lie concealed in a clear, cold abyss to traverse the paths of the Dark Gate, ride the Heavenly One’s horse to wander the Purple Chamber, ascend the Heavenly One’s Bright Hall, or enter the Golden Coffer of the Jade Maiden. One may stand beneath the Three Canopies with the back toward the *Fu* star and face the *Guan* star, or cast off one’s headscarf and remove one’s shoes—[text missing]—boiling gall, wearing talismans, residing in guarded seclusion, using the clear liquid of cassia and platycodon, the Six *Jia* Parents’ adhesive, the *Pi Ce* glue, the Horse Mud Pill, the Wooden *Xu*’s essence, or the Mugwort of the Metal *Shang*. These may transform one into a child, an old man, a bird, a beast, grass, or a tree, or into the Six Domestic Animals. One may merge with wood to become wood, with stone to become stone, with water to become water, or with fire to become fire—this is what is meant by shifting form and altering appearance, though it does not allow for prolonged vanishing.\n\nSomeone asked: \"Cao Cao of Wei once captured Zuo Yuanfang and bound him in shackles, yet he escaped naturally. By what method was this achieved?\"\n\n*Baopuzi* replied: \"I cannot claim precise knowledge of what Master Zuo employed, but having perused various esoteric texts, I find methods such as taking adlay seeds thrice monthly with the Three-Five Yin Elixir, or using paired teeth and the Yang Embryo. Alternatively, one might leap and cast off restraints on the seventh day of the seventh month while facing east, or wear the single garment of the Dragon’s Child on a stone on the fifth day of the fifth month. One might don the robe pierced by lightning on the Summer Solstice, or use the twenty-one-character talisman of celestial patterns, or the blood of one’s father who has departed, or the Jade Child’s Remnant Grain. Combining the Mountain Lord’s Eye, the River Earl’s Remnant Grain, and the dregs of floating clouds to anoint oneself—all these may bring about self-liberation. Yet Master Zuo’s transformations were boundless and not necessarily confined to such methods. When employing the Six *Jia* to alter one’s true form, it cannot be grasped.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Can one who practices the Dao avoid illness?\"\n\n*Baopuzi* said: \"Those who fully embody the principles of nurturing life both ingest divine medicines and practice *qi*-circulation without cease, conducting daily *daoyin* to invigorate the constructive and protective energies, ensuring no blockages. They further employ the arts of the bedchamber with moderation, regulate their diet, avoid wind and dampness, and guard against what they cannot endure—thus they may avoid illness. Yet those who dwell among men often find their resolve divided, their practice inconsistent, and their diligence lacking, so they cannot escape minor ailments.\n\nIf one merely harbors faith in the Dao without engaging in practices that benefit the self, and if one’s destiny lies under the baleful stars of *gu* and *xu*, with the body vulnerable to harm, then the Three Corpses will exploit one’s weakness. On perilous days and inauspicious months, when one enters the realm of fatal illness, they summon malevolent *qi* and recklessly invite demons and specters to wreak havoc. When the Six Calamities converge and the Three Punishments align, disaster is assured. Those still in their prime may develop various illnesses, while those already afflicted will see their conditions worsen. Thus, the ancients who first pursued the Dao invariably studied medicine as well, to remedy immediate misfortunes.\n\nYet common Daoists, ignorant of this principle, rely on what they have heard—methods largely unrelated to healing. Unable to withdraw from the world and seclude themselves to focus solely on inner practices, they lack means to repel illness. When sickness strikes, they are even less capable than ordinary people who specialize in herbal remedies. They are like those who, attempting to advance, cannot master the steps of Handan, and in retreat, lose even the fundamentals of Shouling—utterly bereft.\n\nI have seen the *Golden Coffer* and *Green Satchel* compiled by Dai Ba and Hua Tuo, the *Yellow Silk Prescriptions* of Cui Zhongshu, and the miscellaneous formulas of a hundred schools—some five hundred scrolls in all. Gan, Hu, Lü, Fu, Zhou Shi, Gan Tangtong, Ruan Nanhe, and others each compiled collections of emergency remedies for sudden afflictions, ranging from one hundred and ten to ninety-four, eighty-five, or forty-six entries. The world regards these as exhaustive and precise, beyond improvement.\n\nYet upon close examination, I find them woefully incomplete, lacking remedies for many urgent conditions. They are disorganized, jumbled, and without clear structure, making it difficult to locate and apply treatments swiftly. For acute and violent illnesses, they prescribe costly medicines—dozens of varieties—accessible only to the wealthy residing in the capital, who can afford to stockpile them. Moreover, they often recommend acupuncture, yet fail to clarify the precise locations and measurements, merely listing the names of points and channels. Without prior study of the *Mingtang*, *Liuzhu*, and diagrams of the body’s pathways, how can one comprehend them?\n\nI have compiled a work in one hundred scrolls titled *The Jade Bureau Prescriptions*, organizing ailments by name in a coherent sequence, avoiding confusion. Ninety-three scrolls consist of straightforward, easily applied remedies, readily available even in remote villages. A glance suffices to find treatments for all urgent illnesses. With this book in one’s home, physicians become unnecessary. Most doctors inherit their profession as a family trade, possessing fame without true skill, cultivating empty reputations for profit. The poor and reclusive cannot afford their services, and those who do summon them often suffer from their errors. Far better to master the essentials oneself than to rely on ignorant physicians. Yet physicians are not always available, and even when found, they may refuse immediate aid. By the time they deign to act, the illness has penetrated the interstices, becoming a deep-seated malady in the vital organs—beyond cure. In cases of sudden, severe illness, traveling far to seek help often results in needless death.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Can one foresee future fortune or misfortune, safety or peril, and thus make informed decisions in advance? Is this the mark of one who has attained the Dao?\"\n\n*Baopuzi* replied: \"Observing celestial patterns above and earthly principles below, divining the winds and *qi*, casting milfoil stalks, calculating the Three *Qi*, pacing the Nine Palaces, consulting the Eight Trigrams, examining the positions of flying and hidden stars, diagnosing omens in phenomena, and interpreting fortune and misfortune through cracks in tortoise shells—these are all inferior arts, laborious and unreliable. To perceive all under heaven without stepping beyond one’s curtains—*that* is the work of one who has entered the divine.\n\nAlternatively, one may summon the celestial texts of the Three Sovereigns to invoke the Lords of Life and Peril, the Five Marchmounts, the spirits of the paths and crossroads, and the Six *Ding* deities, causing them to appear and answer questions on all matters. Thus, fortune and misfortune become as clear as if held in the palm, and nothing, however distant or obscure, remains unknown.\n\nOr one may summon the Six Yin Jade Maidens, a process requiring sixty days to complete. Once accomplished, they may be commanded at will. One may also summon the Eight Historians, who are the essences of the Eight Trigrams.\"",

      "translated_text": "Or this is sufficient to foresee what has yet to take shape.\n\nAlternatively, one may ingest *ge* flower, autumn *ma* pollen, or a *daogui* of powder the size of a square *cun* spoon. Suddenly, as if overcome by sleep, one hears voices speaking of matters one was unaware of—fortune and misfortune are instantly determined.\n\nOr one may use a bright mirror of nine *cun* or larger to gaze upon oneself, focusing one’s thoughts for seven days and nights. On the seventh night, one will behold divine immortals—whether male or female, old or young. After a single revelation, the mind will inherently know matters from a thousand *li* away as they unfold.\n\nThe mirror may be used singly or in pairs, called the Sun and Moon Mirrors. If four are used, they are called the Four Compasses, each placed to the front, back, left, and right when gazing. With the Four Compasses, the spirits that appear are numerous—some soaring freely, others riding dragons or tigers, their crowns and robes resplendent in colors unseen in the mortal world. All have their own scriptures and illustrations. To cultivate this Dao, one must first silently recite the names, titles, and ranks of the spirits one seeks to summon, memorizing their attire and regalia. Without this, one may forget their identities upon sudden arrival, or become startled and harmed by them.\n\nThe practice demands stillness and seclusion, preferably in quiet groves or secluded forests, where external forms do not catch the eye and extraneous sounds do not reach the ear. Only then will the Dao surely come to fruition.\n\nThe Three Lads and Nine Maidens, the Longevity Lord with Nine Heads and a Serpent’s Body, and the One Hundred Twenty Officials—though they may appear, one must not gaze upon them too closely. If they question or rebuke you, do not respond. If attendants, radiant warriors, armored soldiers, or those riding dragons and tigers arrive with clamorous drums and pipes, do not lift your eyes or speak to them. Instead, concentrate solely on visualizing the true form of Lord Lao. Once the true form of Lord Lao appears, rise and bow twice.\n\nThe true form of Lord Lao is thus: his surname is Li, his given name Dan, and his courtesy name Boyang. He stands nine *chi* tall, with a yellow complexion, a prominent nose, and elegant brows five *cun* long. His ears measure seven *cun*, and his forehead bears three lines extending from top to bottom. His feet display the Eight Trigrams. He rests upon a bed of divine tortoise, with halls of gold and jade, steps of white silver, and robes of five-colored clouds. He wears a layered crown and wields a sword of sharp steel. One hundred twenty youths attend him: twelve Azure Dragons to his left, twenty-six White Tigers to his right, twenty-four Vermilion Birds before him, and seventy-two Dark Warriors behind. Twelve *Qiongqi* beasts precede him, and thirty-six *Pixie* beasts follow. Thunder and lightning blaze above, radiant and dazzling. This description comes from the immortal scriptures.\n\nUpon beholding Lord Lao, one’s years and lifespan extend, and the mind becomes as bright as the sun and moon, knowing all things without effort.\n\nSomeone asked about the Dao of strengthening teeth. The Master Who Embraces Simplicity replied: \"One who can nourish them with the Flowery Pond and steep them in sweet liquor, brushing them three hundred times each dawn, will ensure they never loosen. Alternatively, holding *dihuang* decoction in the mouth, or *xuandan* soup, snake fat pills, *yushi* pills, or the Nine Thorns Powder, will secure those already loose and cure those afflicted with worms. Taking the Spirit-Flight Powder can even regrow teeth that have fallen out.\"\n\nSomeone asked about the Dao of sharpening hearing. The Master Who Embraces Simplicity replied: \"One who can practice Dragon Leading, Tiger Guiding, Bear Stretching, Tortoise Swallowing, Swallow Flying, Serpent Bending, and Bird Extending—bowing to heaven and earth—ensuring the red and yellow light never leaves the inner chamber, and performing these twelve hundred times, will preserve hearing without loss. For those already deaf, fumigating with *xuanxun*, or plugging the ears with a pouch of thorn tips, sheep dung, cassia bark, and sparrow cinnamon, or using *langdu* and *zhige*, or inserting a mixture of aconite and scallion sap into the ears, or irrigating them with steamed carp brain, will restore hearing.\"\n\nSomeone asked about the Dao of brightening the eyes. The Master Who Embraces Simplicity replied: \"One who can draw the ascending *jing* of the Triple Burner (or the outer *jing*), summon the Great Fire in the south, wash the eyes with bright water, and warm them with sunlight, or burn the *Bing-Ding* Penetrating Vision Talisman and wash the eyes with wine, as the ancients did to read at night—such methods will suffice. Or one may boil *wujingzi* in vinegar until soft, dry them in the sun, grind them into powder, and take a square *cun* spoonful thrice daily. Consuming a whole *dou* enables night vision. Or one may use dog gallbladder to decoct *qingyang*, *banjiu*, *shijueming*, and *chongwei*, or the Hundred Flowers Powder, or steep *jishe* fragrance and *huanglian* in milk and apply it as drops. All eye ailments will be cured, and vision will become twice as sharp as before.\"\n\nSomeone asked about the Dao of ascending steep heights, traversing perilous paths, and journeying without exhaustion. The Master Who Embraces Simplicity replied: \"Only by ingesting the great elixir can one achieve a light body, mighty strength, and endure labor without fatigue. For those newly entering mountains and forests whose bodies are not yet fully robust, it is fitting to use Cloud Pearl Powder, Hundred Flowers Elixir, *xuanzi* soup to wash the feet, Tiger Gallbladder Pills, Vermilion Bright Wine, Heavenly Male Crane Fat Pills, Flying Knife Decoction, Autumn *Mang*, *Cheqian*, and *Zefang* Powder. After ten days of use, not only will one traverse great distances without exhaustion, but one’s pace will become three times faster than usual.\n\nIf one can master the art of *Qiao*-riding, one may roam the world unbound by mountains and rivers. There are three methods of *Qiao*-riding: Dragon *Qiao*, Tiger *Qiao*, and Deer-Reel *Qiao*. Alternatively, one may ingest talismans and concentrate the mind. To travel a thousand *li*, focus for one hour; to travel twelve thousand *li* in a day and night, focus for all twelve hours. Beyond this, one must renew the focus as before. Or one may craft a flying chariot from jujube wood, binding it with oxhide straps and drawing its mechanism with reversed swords. Or one may visualize five serpents, six dragons, and three oxen intersecting at the *gang* position and ride upon them, ascending forty *li* to reach the Great Clarity. Within the Great Clarity, the *qi* is so pure it can sustain a person.\n\nThe master says: when a kite soars higher, it merely stretches its wings straight without flapping, yet advances effortlessly—this is because it gradually rides the pure *qi*. When a dragon first ascends through the clouds, it rises forty *li* before moving on its own. These words come from immortals and have been passed down among the common folk, yet they are truly beyond the ken of ordinary people.\"",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, to ride the *qiao*, one must first observe a prolonged fast, abstaining from meat and blood offerings for a full year before attempting to mount these three *qiao*. Even if one ingests talismans and visualizes the five dragons, the *qiao* of greatest distance, the others will not exceed a thousand *li*. Their ascent, descent, departure, and pause all follow their own methods—one must not act arbitrarily. Should one violate these prohibitions, recklessly riding the *qiao* risks the peril of a fall.\n\nSome ask: The *Laozi* chapters, the *Tortoise-Shell Scriptures*, and other texts all record that in the years of Metal and Wood following great warfare, plagues will surely arise, sparing but one in ten thousand. May I inquire about the Way to evade pestilence? The *Baopuzi* replies: The immortals’ secret method for entering plague-stricken regions involves visualizing oneself as five jades—these jades correspond to the colors of the four seasons: green in spring, red in summer, yellow in the fourth month (or sixth month), white in autumn, and black in winter. One must also visualize wearing a golden headband and one’s heart as a blazing flame, large as a *dou*, so that nothing may inspire fear.\n\nAnother method: visualize one’s hair spreading to cover the body, with a great star fixed at the end of each strand. Further, visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, with the *Kui* inverted over one’s head and the *gang* pointing forward. Then visualize the *qi* of the five viscera issuing from the eyes and enveloping the body like mist—liver *qi* green, lung *qi* white, spleen *qi* yellow, kidney *qi* black, and heart *qi* red—so that the five colors intermingle. Thus, one may share a bed with the plague-stricken.\n\nAlternatively, one may perform the *Yu* step and invoke the Jade Maiden of the Straight Day, or hold the breath while visualizing a force of a hundred and twenty warriors, each wielding a thousand-*jin* hammer, to guard oneself. Other efficacious methods include the *Shegong* pellet, the Red Chariot Envoy pellet, the Marshal pellet, the *Xuchangqing* powder (a medicinal herb), the Jade Casket Essence powder, the Green Ox Daoist’s Fumigation pellet, the *Cui* (or *Que*) Script Yellow (or *Xing*) powder, the Herb Jade Wine, the *Huangting* pellet, the Imperial Talisman, the *Laozi* Neck Talisman, the Red *Hu* Talisman, and the Peach Blossom Talisman.\n\n**Yellow and White (Chapter Sixteen)**\nThe *Baopuzi* states: The *Divine Immortals’ Scriptures* contain twenty-five scrolls and over a thousand methods for the *Yellow and White*.

      "translated_text": "White refers to silver. The ancients guarded this Dao in secrecy and were reluctant to name it directly, hence its euphemistic designation. Some texts title the scrolls *Gengxin*, for *Geng* and *Xin* also pertain to metal. Yet most methods remain deeply concealed, difficult to fathom, and few are clearly explicable. The world often doubts this art as fantastical and false, no different from those who disbelieve in divine immortals.\n\nIn my youth, I studied the Nine Elixirs and the *Scripture of Gold and Silver Liquids* under Master Zheng, and subsequently received five scrolls of the *Central Scripture of the Yellow and White*. Master Zheng recounted that he and Master Zuo had once tested these methods together in the mountains of Lujiang, and all succeeded. Yet the rigor of purification, taboos, and hardships were no less than those required for the golden elixir and divine immortals’ medicines.\n\nVulgar folk often mock my pursuit of arcane arts, accusing me of striving to connect what cannot be connected in the world. Why would I do so? If my aim were merely to dazzle future generations with marvels and ornate prose, my *Outer Chapters* and miscellaneous writings—over two hundred scrolls—would suffice to convey my intent. I would have no need for this. Moreover, these *Inner Chapters* are plain speech, devoid of embellishment.\n\nI am also aware that discussing such matters, most people dismiss them as impractical and irrelevant, far less compelling than debating mundane principles that align with common sentiment. Yet I cannot desist from these pursuits. Though I know they will not find favor in the world’s eyes, I persist in writing of them because I have witnessed their efficacy, and the masters from whom I received transmission did not speak falsely.\n\nI am poor and lack resources, beset by misfortune and relentless hardship. Even the roads are perilous, and medicinal ingredients are unattainable, leaving me no opportunity to practice these arts. Now, when I tell others I know how to transmute gold and silver, yet suffer hunger and cold myself, it is no different from one who cannot walk selling remedies for lameness—how could anyone believe me? Yet one cannot dismiss all possibilities on the basis of a single setback. My diligent recording of these methods in writing is for the sake of future scholars who cherish the strange and prize truth, that they may see my work and grasp the full intent of the Dao.\n\nThe arts of transformation know no bounds. The human body is visible, yet there are methods to conceal it; spirits are hidden, yet there are ways to reveal them. Those who master such arts are many. Water and fire reside in the heavens, yet we draw them forth with burning mirrors. Lead is white by nature, yet it is reddened to make cinnabar; cinnabar is red by nature, yet it is whitened to make lead. Clouds, rain, frost, and snow are all qi of Heaven and Earth, yet they can be replicated with medicines, indistinguishable from the real. Even among creatures that fly and crawl, whose forms are fixed by creation, sudden transformations abound—countless kinds, beyond enumeration.\n\nHumans, the most spiritually endowed of beings, may alter their forms: men and women become cranes, stones, tigers, apes, grains of sand, or soft-shelled turtles—such cases are not rare. Mountains become abysses, and deep valleys rise into ridges—these, too, are transformations of great things. Transformation is the natural way of Heaven and Earth; why should gold and silver alone be exempt from being wrought from other substances?\n\nConsider the fire obtained from a yang-burning mirror or the water drawn from a fang-zhu vessel—are they different from ordinary fire and water? When a snake becomes a dragon, or when thatch is refined into ointment, they are no different from those that arise naturally. Yet the origins and causes of such transformations stem from natural resonance, and only those who exhaust principle and fulfill their nature can comprehend their guiding principles. Only those who trace beginnings to ends can grasp their true conditions.\n\nThose of narrow vision and shallow understanding, confined by their own limitations, dismiss the profound and unfathomable as unfathomable, and relegate divine transformations to the realm of the absurd. Because the Zhou and Confucius did not speak of such things, or because the ancient texts do not record them, they dismiss them entirely—is this not ignorance?\n\nMoreover, when common folk see that Liu Xiang failed to transmute gold, they conclude that such a Dao does not exist in the world. This is like a farmer who, after a flood or drought ruins his harvest, declares that the five grains cannot be cultivated. Wu Dawen, the Prefect of Chengdu, was a learned and erudite man, yet he, too, dismissed most extraordinary matters as implausible. Later, a Daoist taught him the methods of the Yellow and White. Wu tested them: melting lead in an iron vessel and adding a powdered medicine transformed it into silver; further refining it with another medicine turned it into gold.\n\nAfter mastering these methods, Wu studied the arts of thorough vision. Within a hundred days, as he lay abed at night, he could see the celestial patterns and his four neighbors as clearly as if there were no walls or fences. His concubine, Yaohua, who had died, appeared to him and spoke as in life. When he sacrificed at the temple, he heard the temple deity respond to his bow, and the altar seemed to move with a sound. Wu then sighed, saying, “Truly, there is nothing that does not exist in the world. Though the Five Classics do not record such things, one cannot dismiss them out of hand.”\n\nYet those unversed in such arts, upon hearing of them, how could they not be astonished and incredulous?\n\nThere is also the case of Huan Junshan, who recounted that Cheng Wei, a Yellow Gate Gentleman of the Han, was fond of the arts of the Yellow and White. He married the daughter of a master of these methods. Once, while accompanying the imperial procession, Cheng found himself without proper attire and grew anxious. His wife said, “Let me procure two bolts of silk.” Immediately, the silk appeared before them. Cheng consulted the *Hongbao* in his pillow and attempted to transmute gold, but failed. His wife came to observe and found him fanning the coals, heating a crucible filled with mercury. She said, “Let me show you something.” She took a small amount of medicine from her pouch and added it to the crucible. After the time it takes to eat a meal, she opened it, and the mercury had turned to silver.\n\nCheng was astonished and asked, “This Dao was near at hand all along, yet why did you not tell me sooner?” His wife replied, “One must be destined to receive it.” From then on, Cheng entreated her day and night, selling fields and houses to provide fine food and clothing, yet she still refused to teach him. Cheng then conspired with a companion to beat and torture her, but she only told him, “The Dao must be transmitted to the right person. If you encounter such a person on the road, you may teach them. But if their mouth speaks one thing while their heart holds another, even if you cut them to pieces, the Dao will not emerge.”\n\nCheng persisted in pressuring her, and she eventually went mad, stripping naked and running about, smearing herself with mud, until she died.\n\nRecently, Hua Lingsi, the Prefect of Lijiang, was a man of great talent, learning, and broad knowledge, yet he, too, dismissed most extraordinary matters as implausible. Later, a Daoist taught him the methods of the Yellow and White. Hua tested them: melting lead in an iron vessel and adding a powdered medicine transformed it into silver; further refining it with another medicine turned it into gold. After learning from this Daoist, Hua mastered the arts of thorough vision. Within a hundred days, as he lay abed at night, he could see the celestial patterns and his four neighbors as clearly as if there were no walls or fences. His concubine, Yaohua, who had died, appeared to him and spoke as in life. When he sacrificed at the temple, he heard the temple deity respond to his bow, and the altar seemed to move with a sound. Hua then sighed, saying, “Truly, there is nothing that does not exist in the world. Though the Five Classics do not record such things, one cannot dismiss them out of hand.”",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, the arts of the Yellow and White, like the compounding of divine elixirs, both require a hundred days or more of fasting and purification. One must also find a secluded place, comprehend the meaning of the alchemical texts, and only then may proceed—these arts are not for those of impure conduct, nor for the dull-witted or those who seldom engage with the numerological arts. Some methods may require oral instructions, which should all be transmitted by a master. It is also fitting to enter deep mountains, to a place of purity, and not let vulgar fools know of it. Yet Liu Xiang practiced these arts within the palace, employing palace women to attend to the work—surely they were not fasting and purifying themselves, nor could they sever all worldly affairs to prevent comings and goings. How could such a practice ever succeed?\n\nThe *New Discourses* of Huan Tan states: Shi Zixin, seeing that he had been appointed as an official in the Chancellor’s office, ordered the construction of a workshop, mobilizing clerks, officers, and even palace slaves and maids to assist him in making gold. When it failed, the Chancellor himself admitted his efforts were insufficient and reported to Empress Dowager Fu that gold was no longer profitable. Yet when he heard that gold, once refined, could be used to make longevity elixirs, he eagerly desired it. He then reassigned Shi Zixin to the Northern Palace of the Weiyang Palace, where attendants were assigned to serve him. How could such divine methods be practiced within the palace, allowing common people to mingle and work together? Even dyeing and bleaching silk in the secular world is not to be witnessed by outsiders—if seen, the process is ruined—how much more so for the transformations of the Yellow and White?\n\nIn all matters, great or small, one must grasp the essentials. Without proper method, even brewing wine, making soy sauce, vinegar, or stews may fail—how much more so for greater undertakings? I once consulted Master Zheng, saying: “The Old Master said, ‘Do not value rare and precious goods.’ In the age of perfect governance, gold is cast into the mountains and jade discarded in the valleys. I wonder why the ancients prized gold and silver yet left behind their methods.”\n\nMaster Zheng replied: “What the Old Master spoke of refers to those who sift through sand, split rocks, drain mountains, and dredge abysses, traveling thousands of miles without fear of being crushed or drowned, seeking rare treasures to hinder the people’s seasons, never knowing contentment, adorning the useless, and even those who aspire to the Dao and seek long life—such men are no different from merchants. They lack integrity, plunge into peril, chase profits without regard for life or limb, and do not cultivate frugal desires. As for the true person who makes gold, it is for the purpose of ingesting it to attain immortality, not to become wealthy. Thus, the scriptures say: ‘Gold can be made, and the world can be transcended.’ Silver may also be ingested, though it is not as effective as gold.”\n\nI objected: “Why not ingest the gold and silver of the world instead of transmuting them? If one makes them, are they not false? And if false, can they be deceptive?”\n\nMaster Zheng replied: “The gold and silver of the world are indeed good, but Daoists are generally poor. As the saying goes, ‘There are no fat immortals or wealthy Daoists.’ If a master has ten or five disciples, how can they obtain enough gold and silver to supply them? And they cannot travel far to gather them, so it is fitting to make them. Moreover, the gold transmuted from medicines is the essence of all ingredients, superior to the natural kind. The *Immortals’ Scripture* says, ‘The essence of cinnabar generates gold’—this is the method of making gold from elixirs. Thus, in the mountains where cinnabar is found, gold often lies beneath. When gold is successfully made, it is a true substance, its interior and exterior indistinguishable, unchanging even after a hundred refinements. Hence, the method states it can be used to make nails, demonstrating its hardness and strength. This is the attainment of the natural Dao. If one can achieve this, how can it be called deception?\n\nDeception refers to coating iron with malachite to turn it red like copper, or transforming silver with egg white to make it yellow like gold—these are changes only on the surface, not within. The *Immortals’ Scripture* records methods for cultivating lingzhi mushrooms with the Five Stones and Five Woods, and the mushrooms thus grown are no different from the natural ones, both granting long life. This is akin to making gold. The pheasant transforms into a clam, the sparrow into a mussel—these are the same as their natural counterparts. Thus, the scripture says: ‘The flowing pearl, after nine transformations, the father does not tell the son.’ It also says: ‘Cinnabar made into gold and ingested ascends to immortality—this is the way of the superior adept. Eating lingzhi, practicing breath control, and swallowing qi grants long life—this is the way of the middling adept. Consuming herbs and plants to live a thousand years—this is the way of the lesser adept.’\n\nIt further states: ‘Gold and silver can be made with their natural properties. Long life can be learned and attained.’ The *Jade Tablet Record* says: ‘All under heaven may attain long life—it is only hesitation that prevents success.’ Mercury congealed into gold can be used to make nails.”",

      "translated_text": "The *Bronze Pillar Scripture* states: “Cinnabar can be transmuted into gold; the ‘river chariot’ can be made into silver. Once established, it can be accomplished—once accomplished, it becomes the true elixir. Mastering this Way, one may attain an immortal body.” Huangshanzi said: “Heaven and earth possess gold, and I can make it. Two yellows and one red—once established, there is no doubt.” The *Tortoise-Shell Script* declares: “My life is in my hands, not in Heaven’s. When the returning elixir is perfected and gold is made, it endures for ten thousand myriad years. How could the ancients have deceived me?”\n\nYet the trouble lies in this: those who know this Way are often poor, and the medicines may be of low value but grow in distant lands, unattainable in times of chaos. Take, for instance, salt from the Qiang tribes and bittern from the marshes—both are worthless things, not even a coin in times of peace. Now, though their price is unrestricted, none can be bought. As for Qiangli’s chalcanthite, though one might offer ten thousand coins for a single catty, it cannot be obtained. Thus, those who merely know the method are no different from those who do not—how lamentable!\n\nThose who possess the method may suffer hunger and cold, lacking the means to compound it, while the wealthy and noble remain ignorant of the method. Even if they knew it, none would believe it. Suppose some did believe—being already rich in gold and silver, who would willingly spend their visible wealth to purchase the medicinal substances, fearing the regret of casting aside what is secure to chase what flies away? Thus, none are willing to do so. Moreover, calculating the cost of the medicines against the value of what is obtained reveals even greater profit, yet the additional requirements of fasting, purification, and hardship deter them from attempting it.\n\nFurthermore, without the oral instructions of a renowned master, one must not lightly undertake this practice. Even in medicine, the ingredients are quite ordinary, yet their commonly used and effective formulas are kept secret.

      "translated_text": "This Dao, once accomplished, enables one to attain longevity—longevity being the ultimate of the Way. Thus did the ancients hold it in such esteem. Now, among the substances named in alchemical formulas, some may share names with common drugs yet are not the same. For instance, the *Heavenly Maid of the River* is not a woman; *Master Bright of Mount Lingyang* is not a man; *Yu’s Remnant Grain* is not rice; *Yao’s Brew* is not water. Yet when ordinary people see formulas calling for *dragon’s gall*, *tiger’s paw*, *chicken’s head*, *duck’s foot*, *horse’s hoof*, *dog’s blood*, *rat’s tail*, or *ox’s knee*, they assume these are merely substances of blood and qi. When they see *broken cups*, *upturned basins*, *cauldrons*, *dikes*, *great dikes*, *arrow shafts*, or *heavenly hooks*, they take them for vessels of iron or clay. When they see *Hu the Royal Envoy*, *Yigu the Spinster*, *Wild Man of Culture*, *Guardian of the Fields*, *Dai Wen*, *Yu the Bathing One*, or *Xu Changqing*, they suppose these are merely human names. Given such superficial understanding, how could they grasp the profound and secret formulas? No wonder Liu Xiang failed in his attempt to transmute gold.\n\nYet once one grasps the essentials, the practice does not require the talents of sages or great worthies—any person may undertake it. Was Liu Xiang an ordinary man? His failure lay solely in not receiving the oral instructions. Now, I shall record its essentials and demonstrate its efficacy to bequeath them to like-minded seekers of future generations.\n\nFirst, obtain *realgar* from Wudu, its cinnabar hue bright as a rooster’s comb, lustrous and free of impurities. The quantity may be chosen at will, but it must not be less than five *jin*.",

      "translated_text": "Grind the realgar to a fine powder and mix it with ox bile, then boil until dry. Take a red clay crucible with a capacity of one *dou*, first line its interior with a three-*fen* layer of *rong* salt and chalcanthite powder. Then add a five-*fen* layer of realgar powder, followed by another layer of *rong* salt, repeating this pattern until the crucible is filled. Add crushed charcoal the size of jujube pits to a depth of two *cun*. Seal the crucible’s exterior with a mixture of earthworm and mole cricket soil and *rong* salt, forming a three-*cun*-thick layer to prevent leakage. Cover with another crucible, similarly sealed, and allow to air-dry for one month. Then, using horse dung as fuel, gently heat for three days and nights. Upon cooling and opening, strike the crucible to release the copper, which will flow like molten bronze or iron. Cast this copper into tubes, then fill them with cinnabar water. Again, heat with horse dung for thirty days, open the furnace, and strike to obtain the refined metal. Use this metal to fashion another tube, fill it with cinnabar water, and heat with horse dung for another thirty days. Upon opening, grind the contents, mixing two parts of the refined metal with one part raw cinnabar and powdered mercury. The mixture will immediately congeal into lustrous yellow gold, hard enough to withstand hammering.\n\n**Method for Preparing Cinnabar Water:**\nTake one *jin* of cinnabar and place it in a fresh bamboo tube. Add two *liang* each of chalcanthite and nitre. Seal the tube’s openings with lacquer and bone glue, ensuring it is thoroughly dry before immersing it in strong vinegar buried three *chi* deep in the earth. After thirty days, it will transform into a red, bitter-tasting liquid.\n\n**Master Jinlou’s Method for Transmuting Gold (Learned from Qinglinzi):**\nFashion tin into squares six *cun* wide and one *cun* two *fen* thick. Mix red salt with lye to form a paste, coating the tin to a uniform thickness of one *fen*. Layer the coated tin in a red clay crucible, using four *jin* of red salt for every ten *jin* of tin. Seal the crucible tightly and heat with horse dung for thirty days. Upon opening, the tin will resemble ash, with bean-sized golden granules within. Place these in an earthen jar, refine with charcoal ten times, and they will fully transmute into gold. From ten *jin* of tin, twenty *liang* of gold may be obtained. Only crucibles from Changsha, Guiyang, Yuzhang, and Nanhai are suitable, as the locals frequently use them for cooking.\n\n**Method for Preparing Red Salt:**\nTake one *jin* each of cold salt, cold water stone, cold feather stone, and white *bin*, and place them in an iron vessel. Heat with charcoal until melted and turned red, then remove for use.\n\n**Master Jiaoli’s Method for Transmuting Gold (Learned from Jiqiuzi):**\nPlace two parts *bin* water stone in an iron vessel and heat with charcoal until boiling. Add mercury in any quantity, stirring until well combined. After six or seven boils, pour onto the ground to form white silver. Then, in a crucible, combine one part each of cinnabar water and azurite water with two parts realgar water. Heat over a crucible fire, stirring until well mixed, then add more charcoal and boil. Introduce the white silver into this mixture, again in any quantity, and boil six or seven times. Pour onto the ground, and upon solidifying, it will become high-quality purple-gold.\n\n**Method for Preparing Realgar Water:**\nPlace one *jin* of realgar in a fresh bamboo tube, add two *liang* of nitre, seal as before, and bury in strong vinegar three *chi* deep for twenty days. It will dissolve into a liquid. The methods for preparing azurite water and *bin* stone water are identical, though each must be stored in separate tubes.\n\n**Method for Transmuting Gold (Attributed to a Child):**\nFashion a large iron tube, one *chi* two *cun* in diameter and height, and a smaller iron tube, six *cun* in diameter, polished smooth. Grind together one *jin* each of red halloysite, nitre, mica, ochre, and calcite, along with half a *jin* of sulfur and four *liang* of malachite. Sift the mixture finely and knead with vinegar to coat the interior of the small tube to a thickness of two *cun*. Add one *jin* of mercury, half a *jin* of cinnabar, and half a *jin* of *liangfei*.\n\n**Method for Preparing *Liangfei*:**\nTake ten *jin* of lead and melt in an iron basin over a furnace. Add three *liang* of mercury, stirring until fully amalgamated. Scoop out the early-formed amalgam with an iron ladle—this is *liangfei*.\n\nPlace the *liangfei* in the small tube, cover with mica, and seal with an iron lid. Position the tube inside the furnace, then melt lead and pour it into the large tube until it submerges the small tube, leaving half a *cun* of the small tube exposed. Heat vigorously for three days and nights to produce *zifen*. Melt ten *jin* of lead in an iron vessel for twenty days, then transfer to a copper vessel. Once the lead melts, add the *zifen* in portions the size of a square *cun* spoon, stirring to transmute it into gold. To produce silver, place mercury in an iron vessel, add *zifen* to a depth of three *cun*, heat until combined, and pour into water to form silver.\n\n**Master Wuchengzi’s Method:**\nFashion an iron tube nine *cun* long and five *cun* in diameter. Grind three *jin* of realgar and mix with equal parts earthworm, mole cricket, and *rang* soil to form a paste. Coat the interior of the tube to a diameter of three *cun*, leaving the opening four *cun* wide. Add two *ge* of cinnabar water, then heat over horse dung until thoroughly dry. Place the tube inside a copper cylinder, seal with a copper lid, and reinforce with yellow sand. Cover with a layer of *rang* soil, ensuring no leaks. Position the assembly in a furnace surrounded by three *cun* of charcoal, heating until the tube’s opening glows red. Upon cooling, the realgar will have entered the copper cylinder. Repeat the process until all three *jin* of realgar’s essence collects in the cylinder. Mix this with an equal part of yellow sand and construct a furnace of any size. To use, place the furnace in a charcoal fire until red-hot, then add mercury. When the mercury becomes active, introduce lead, and golden streams will rise from the sides to converge in the center. Pour onto the ground to form gold. Each furnace can produce one thousand five hundred *jin* of gold before its power is exhausted.\n\nThis gold, when steeped in wine made from *Vitex negundo* and red millet for one hundred days, becomes malleable. Consuming a pill the size of a small bean three times daily, one *jin* in total, will dispel the three corpses, cure all diseases, restore sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and return the elderly to the vitality of a thirty-year-old. It renders one impervious to fire, repels all evil and poisons, and protects against cold winds, heat, and dampness. Consuming three *jin* enables walking on water, traversing mountains, and summoning spirits for protection. Lifespan becomes boundless as heaven and earth. Rubbing a pill with *Ailanthus* blood and *zhucao* juice restores vision to see demons and subterranean objects, and allows writing in darkness. Coating a pill with white sheep’s blood and casting it into water will immediately summon fish and dragons for capture.",

      "translated_text": "**The Inner Chapters of the Master Embracing Simplicity, Scroll Four**\n*By Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty*\n**Chapter Seventeen: On Ascending Mountains and Crossing Rivers**\n\nSomeone asked about the Dao of ascending mountains. The Master Embracing Simplicity said: All who seek the Dao, compound medicines, or take refuge in the mountains to avoid chaos must enter the mountains. Yet those who do not know the proper method of entering often encounter misfortune. Hence the saying: \"Beneath Mount Taihua, white bones lie scattered like kindling.\" This refers to those who know but one thing and cannot be broadly prepared. Though they harbor the will to live, they instead hasten their deaths.\n\nMountains, great or small, all possess spirits. The larger the mountain, the greater its spirit; the smaller, the lesser. Those who enter without technique will surely suffer harm—afflicted by illness, pierced by thorns, or stricken with terror and unease. Some see lights and shadows, hear strange sounds, or witness great trees topple without wind, rocks fall without cause, striking and killing people. Others are driven mad, wandering in confusion until they plunge into ravines, or are beset by tigers, wolves, and venomous creatures. One must not enter the mountains lightly.\n\nOne should enter in the third or ninth month, for these are the months when mountains \"open.\" One must also choose an auspicious day and hour within these months. If matters are urgent and one cannot wait, one may simply select an auspicious day and hour.\n\nAll who enter the mountains must first purify themselves for seven days, avoiding defilement. They should carry the *Ascending Mountain Talisman* and, upon departing, perform the *Threefold and Fivefold Circumambulation Rite* around the body. Moreover, the Five Peaks have years of calamity, just as the Nine Provinces experience cycles of prosperity and decline. When a region receives the *Flying Talisman* of baleful *qi*, its rulers and officials should not act—this is also true for dwellings and mountains.\n\nOne must also strictly avoid entering the Eastern Peak in the first or second month of a *jia-yi* or *yin-mao* year; the Southern Peak in the fourth or fifth month of a *bing-ding* or *si-wu* year; the Western Peak in the seventh or eighth month of a *geng-xin* or *shen-you* year; the Central Peak in the fourth-season months of a *wu-ji* year; and the Northern Peak in the tenth or eleventh month of a *ren-gui* or *hai-zi* year. One must not enter Mount Taihua, Mount Huo, Mount Heng, Mount Tai, or Mount Songgao in these years, for the same prohibitions apply to all directions of these peaks.\n\nAll aged creatures possess essences that can assume human form to delude the eyes and test people, yet they cannot alter their true form in a mirror. Thus, ancient Daoist masters entering the mountains always carried a bright mirror, nine *cun* or larger, suspended behind their backs. Then, no old specters would dare approach. If something comes to test a person, one should glance at the mirror: if it is an immortal or a benevolent mountain spirit, its reflection will appear human; if it is a bird, beast, or malevolent specter, its true form will be revealed.\n\nMoreover, when old specters depart, they always retreat backward. One may turn the mirror to face them and observe their reflection: if they lack heels, they are old specters; if they have heels, they are mountain spirits.\n\nFormerly, Zhang Gai (or *He*) and Gao Ou (or *Hao*) were both cultivating their thoughts in a stone chamber on Mount Yuntai when suddenly a man in a yellow linen robe and hemp headscarf approached and said, \"Are you weary, Daoists, from your toils in these secluded mountains?\" The two glanced at their mirror and saw it was a deer. They asked, \"You are an old deer of these mountains—how dare you feign human form?\" Before the words were finished, the visitor turned into a deer and fled.\n\nAt an inn beneath Mount Linlü, there was a demon that often caused travelers to die or fall ill. Nightly, dozens of figures in yellow, white, or black robes—some male, some female—would appear. Later, a man named Xi Bo (or *Zhi*) encountered them while lodging there. He sat with bright lamps burning and recited scriptures. At midnight, over ten figures came and sat opposite him, playing *chupu* and gambling. Xi secretly shone his mirror upon them and saw they were a pack of dogs. He stood, holding a candle, and pretended to accidentally singe their robes with the flame, filling the air with the stench of scorched fur. Grasping a small knife, he seized one and stabbed it. It first cried out in a human voice, then died as a dog. The rest fled, and the hauntings ceased—all thanks to the power of the mirror.\n\nSuperior adepts entering the mountains carry the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns* and the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, summoning the mountain spirits and consulting the *Demon Registers* of stone, earth, and mountain officials. Then, the spirits of trees and stones, the essences of mountains and rivers, dare not test them. Lesser adepts establish the *Seventy-Two Talismans of the Spirit Guardians* to control the hundred evils, or use the *Seal of the Vermilion Official* and the *Twelve Seals of Prime Origin* to seal the four directions of their dwelling—then no evil will dare approach. Still lesser adepts carry the *Eightfold Numinous Staff* and wear the *Jade Talisman of Laozi*, by which they may command the mountain spirits—how could they dare bring harm?\n\nI have heard my teacher, Master Zheng, speak thus, though I cannot fully grasp these matters. My master often told his disciples: \"Those who seek the Dao as if grieving over poverty or lamenting a lowly station—how could they not attain it? The only danger is a lack of steadfast resolve, pursuing the near and forgetting the far. At first, they are delighted, leaning forward eagerly, but soon they forget as if it were nothing. The benefits of a hair’s breadth are not secured, while the losses of a mountain’s weight never cease—how then can they exhaust the subtleties of the ultimate words or achieve the loftiest peaks of the Dao?\"\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity said: The great taboos for entering mountains are as follows—\n- First month: *wu* day\n- Second month: *hai* day\n- Third month: *shen* day\n- Fourth month: *xu* day\n- Fifth month: *wei* (or *xu*) day\n- Sixth month: *mao* day\n- Seventh month: *jia-zi* day\n- Eighth month: *shen-zi* day\n- Ninth month: *yin* day\n- Tenth month: *chen-wei* day\n- Eleventh month: *ji-chou* day\n- Twelfth month: *yin* day\n\nAuspicious days for entering mountains are: *jia-zi*, *jia-yin*, *yi-hai*, *ji-si*, *yi-mao*, *bing-xu*, *bing-wu*, *bing-chen*, and *si* days—these are greatly auspicious.\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity said: According to the *Secret Records of the Nine Heavens* and the *Taiyi Hidden Stems*, when entering mountains in a long month, avoid the 3rd, 11th, 15th, 18th, 24th, 26th, and 30th days. In a short month, avoid the 1st, 5th, 13th, 16th, 26th, and 28th days. Those who enter on these days will surely be tested by mountain spirits, their aims unfulfilled, their works unaccomplished. Not only Daoists, but all who enter on these days will suffer harm, encountering tigers, wolves, and venomous creatures.\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity said: The conditions of Heaven and Earth, the auspicious and inauspicious aspects of yin and yang—how vast and obscure they are!",

      "translated_text": "The intricacies of these matters are indeed difficult to detail. I neither assert their certainty nor dare guarantee their absence. Yet the Yellow Emperor and the Grand Duke both trusted and relied upon them; more recently, Yan Junping and Sima Qian both employed them as authoritative. The classics and traditions speak of \"governing the calendar and illuminating the seasons,\" of days of firmness and softness. An ancient saying declares: \"Auspicious days are only *wu*—this has long been so.\" Kings established the office of Grand Historian, and all appointments, establishments, and affairs—whether ancestral sacrifices, suburban rites, or offerings to Heaven and Earth—were conducted only after selecting propitious times. How foolish and ignorant it is, then, for even mediocre men who claim to transcend the vulgar to scorn the choice of good days in their actions!\n\nWhenever I have observed those entering mountains without regard for favorable times and days, the consequences have proven real—one must not enter lightly.\n\nAccording to the *Jade Lock Classic*: \"Those who wish to enter famous mountains must know the secret arts of *dunjia*, yet these are not explained in detail for others.\" The *Lingbao Scripture* states: \"When entering mountains, one should use *bao* days, *yi* days, or *zhuan* days—these are greatly auspicious. To use *zhi* days or *fa* days is certain death, for there is no second Way.\"\n\nIn my youth, I harbored the ambition to enter mountains, and for this reason I studied *dunjia* texts, of which there are over sixty volumes. The matters are too vast to master quickly, so I excerpted their essentials to create a ready reference for my satchel. Though I have not transmitted them in writing, I now discuss their general principles. Those of discernment who wish to enter mountains and practice these arts should seek out those who know them—such people are not entirely absent from the world.\n\nThe *Central Classic of Dunjia* states: \"To seek the Dao, use *tiannei* days and *tiannei* hours to subdue demons and spirits, and apply talismanic writing. On *tianqin* days and *tianqin* hours, enter famous mountains, and all evil, tigers, wolves, venomous creatures, and bandits will not dare approach. Exit through *tiancang* and enter through *dihu*—all *gui* days are *tiancang*, and all *ji* days are *dihu*.\"\n\nIt further says: \"To avoid the chaos of the world and vanish into famous mountains, free from worry, use the *dingmao* day of the *shangyuan* period, called the time of *yinde*—also known as *tianxin*. This is what is meant by 'sinking into obscurity in broad daylight,' where the sun and moon lose their light and humans and spirits cannot see you.\"\n\nAgain, it says: \"To seek immortality and enter famous mountains, use *gui* days and *gui* hours—also called *tiangong* days—when one is certain to transcend the world.\"\n\nIt also states: \"When going into mountain forests, take grass from the *Qinglong* with your left hand, break it in half, and place it beneath the *Fengxing*. Pass through the *Mingtang*, enter the *Taiyin*, and perform the *Yu* step while reciting the incantation: *'Nuogao, Great Yin General, hear this: your humble descendant, Wang Jia, does not open to outsiders. Let those who see Jia take him for bundled firewood; let those who do not see Jia take him for a non-human.'* Then place the grass you hold on the ground, take soil with your left hand, and apply it to your philtrum. Hold the grass in your right hand to shield yourself, extend your left hand forward, and perform the *Yu* step to the *gui* position. Hold your breath and proceed—humans and spirits will not see you.\"\n\nAll *jia* days are *Qinglong*, all *yi* days are *Fengxing*, all *bing* days are *Mingtang*, and all *ding* days are *Yinzhong*.\n\nThe *Jiji* hexagram of the *Book of Changes* begins with the first and second lines, where the traces do not match the nine-trace sequence, yet they remain interconnected. One step is seven *chi*; it is also said that one *chi* equals two *zhang* and one *chi* (or, in another version, one step is three *chi*). Glance at the nine traces.\n\nThe method of the *Yu* step: Stand upright with the right foot forward and the left foot behind. Next, advance the right foot again, then bring the left foot behind the right foot—this is one step. Then advance the right foot again, then the left foot, bringing the right foot to join the left—this is the second step. Next, advance the right foot again, bringing the left foot to join the right—this is the third step. Thus, the method of the *Yu* step is complete.\n\nAll arts under Heaven should employ the *Yu* step—this is not limited to these matters.\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity said: The *Lingbao Scripture* states that so-called *bao* days are those where the heavenly stems generate the earthly branches, such as *jiawu* or *yisi* days. *Jia* is Wood, *wu* is Fire; *yi* is also Wood, *si* is also Fire—Fire is born of Wood. *Yi* days are those where the earthly branches generate the heavenly stems, such as *renshen* or *guiyou* days. *Ren* is Water, *shen* is Metal; *gui* is also Water, *you* is also Metal—Water is born of Metal. So-called *zhi* days are those where the heavenly stems overcome the earthly branches, such as *wuzi* or *jihai* days. *Wu* is Earth, *zi* is Water; *ji* is also Earth, *hai* is also Water—by the principles of the Five Phases, Earth overcomes Water. *Fa* days are those where the earthly branches overcome the heavenly stems, such as *jiashen* or *yiyou* days. *Jia* is Wood, *shen* is Metal; *yi* is also Wood, *you* is also Metal—Metal overcomes Wood.

      "translated_text": "The *Baopuzi* states: When entering famous mountains, choose an *jiazi* day or a *kai* or *chu* day, and hang five-inch squares of silk in the five colors on a large stone—whatever is sought will surely be obtained. It also says: When entering mountains, one should know the secret incantation of the Six *Jia*: \"Lin bing dou zhe jie zhen lie qian xing\"—nine characters in all. These should always be silently recited; there is nothing they cannot avert. This is the essential and unburdensome Way.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: In the mountains, the forms of mountain spirits resemble small children with a single foot, walking backward. They delight in assaulting people. If one enters the mountains and hears human sounds at night, loudly call out their name, *Qizhi*, and they will not dare to harm the person. Another name for them is *Nei*; one may also call them by this name. There is also a mountain spirit resembling a drum, red in color, with a single foot—its name is *Hui*. Another appears like a person, nine feet tall, clad in fur and wearing a bamboo hat—its name is *Jinlei*. Or it may resemble a dragon, five-colored with a red head—its name is *Feifei*. Upon seeing them, call them by their names, and they will not dare to cause harm.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: In the mountains, there are large trees that can speak—not that the trees themselves speak, but their spirit is named *Yunyang*. Calling its name brings good fortune. If one sees firelight in the mountains at night, it is merely the work of long-dead withered wood; do not be alarmed. If one sees a person of the *Fan* tribe in the mountains at night, it is the spirit of bronze or iron. Seeing a person from the Qin dynasty is the spirit of a hundred-year-old tree; do not be alarmed, for they cannot cause harm. Those who appear in mountains and waters to summon people are called *Sijiao*; calling their names brings good fortune. If one sees a large snake in the mountains wearing a cap and headscarf, its name is *Shengxiang*; calling its name brings good fortune. If one sees an official in the mountains or only hears a voice but does not see its form, and it ceaselessly calls out to people, throw a white stone at it, and it will cease. Another method: use reeds to make a *ru* or *mao* and stab it—this also brings good fortune. If a mountain spirit comes to call a person and begs for food without ceasing, throw white cogon grass at it, and it will die. If a mountain spirit constantly bewilders people and causes them to lose their way, throw a reed staff at it, and it will die.\n\nIn the mountains, on *yin* days, those who call themselves *Yu officials* are tigers; those who call themselves *Lords of the Road* are wolves; those who call themselves *Magistrates* are old raccoon dogs. On *mao* days, those who call themselves *Elder* are hares; those who call themselves *Eastern King Father* are elk; those who call themselves *Western Queen Mother* are deer. On *chen* days, those who call themselves *Rain Masters* are dragons; those who call themselves *River Earls* are fish; those who call themselves *Lord of the Gutless* are crabs. On *si* days, those who call themselves *The Solitary* are snakes in the earth-altar; those who call themselves *Time Lords* are toads. On *wu* days, those who call themselves *The Three Dukes* are horses; those who call themselves *Immortals* are old trees. On *wei* days, those who call themselves *Hosts* are sheep; those who call themselves *Officials* are river deer. On *shen* days, those who call themselves *Human Lords* are monkeys; those who call themselves *Nine Ministers* are apes. On *you* days, those who call themselves *Generals* are roosters; those who call themselves *Thief-Catchers* are pheasants. On *xu* days, those who call themselves by human surnames and given names are dogs; those who call themselves *Lord of Chengyang* are foxes. On *hai* days, those who call themselves *Women* are gold and jade; those who call themselves *Divine Lords* are pigs. On *zi* days, those who call themselves *Altar Lords* are rats; those who call themselves *Divine Persons* are bats. On *chou* days, those who call themselves *Scholars* are oxen. Simply knowing the names of these creatures prevents them from causing harm.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the method for dwelling in mountains and marshes to avoid snakes and vipers? The *Baopuzi* replied: In ancient times, the Round Mound abounded with large snakes and also produced fine medicines. When the Yellow Emperor was about to ascend it, Guangchengzi taught him to wear realgar, and all the snakes departed. Now, when entering mountain forests and grasslands, carry five ounces or more of Wudu realgar, the color of a rooster’s comb, and one will not fear snakes. If a snake bites a person, place a small amount of realgar powder into the wound, and it will immediately heal. Though there are many kinds of snakes, only the viper and the green-gold snake bite people with the greatest urgency; if untreated, they kill a person within a day. Those who do not know the methods of treatment and are bitten by these two snakes should cut the wound with a knife, scrape the flesh, and cast it to the ground—it will boil as if roasted by fire. When the flesh is entirely scorched, the person will survive. During the seventh and eighth months, when these snakes’ venom is at its peak, they cannot bite people, and their venom does not dissipate. Instead, they gnaw on large bamboo and small trees, which immediately wither and dry. Now, Daoists entering mountains only know grand methods but do not understand the way to avoid such dangers—this is no small matter.\n\nBefore entering the mountains, one should first practice at home. Learn the method of restraint: visualize the sun, moon, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Azure Dragon, and White Tiger to guard one’s body, then proceed. Upon reaching the mountain forests and grasslands, inhale three breaths from the left, hold them, and blow into the mountain grasses, imagining this breath as red, like clouds and mist filling dozens of miles. If there are companions, no matter how many, have them stand in rows and blow the breath upon them. Even if they tread upon snakes, the snakes will not dare to move, and they will scarcely encounter any. If one sees a snake, face the sun, inhale three breaths from the left, hold them, press the tongue against the roof of the mouth, pinch the *duguan* point with the hand, close the Heavenly Gate, and block the Earthly Door. Then press down on the snake’s head with an object, bind it with the hand, and draw a prison on the ground to contain it—it may also be captured and played with. Even if it coils around the neck, it will not dare to bite. If one does not know how to release the restraint, spit out the breath to blow upon it, and it will never escape the prison. If another person is bitten by a snake, inhale three breaths from the left and blow upon them, and they will immediately recover, feeling no more pain. If they are ten or more miles away, one may also perform the breath from afar, calling out their name. For a man, pray with the left hand; for a woman, pray with the right hand, and they too will recover.\n\nMaster Jie’s method: Upon dwelling in the mountains, visualize five-colored snakes, each with one head, then hold the breath and pierce them with bent green bamboo or small wooden boards. Walk the *Yubu* step to the left, visualize thousands of centipedes covering the body, and one will never encounter snakes. Alternatively, carry dried ginger and aconite behind the elbow, or burn the horns of oxen, sheep, or deer to fumigate the body, or carry Wang Fangping’s realgar pills, or place the dirt from a pig’s ear and musk pills under the toenails—all are effective. Also, musk and wild boars both eat snakes, so they are used to ward them off. Moreover, the *yunri* bird and the *yong* both eat snakes, so southerners entering the mountains carry the tails of *yong* and the beaks of *yunri* birds to avoid snakes. If a snake bites a person, scrape these two substances and apply them to the wound, and it will immediately heal. *Tan* is another name for the *zhen* bird. Also, southerners entering the mountains carry bamboo tubes containing live centipedes. Where there are snakes, the centipedes will move within the tube, so one should carefully inspect the grass and will surely see the snake. If a large snake, over a *zhang* long and a *wei* in girth, is encountered, the centipede can restrain it with its breath, and the snake will die.",

      "translated_text": "When snakes see centipedes on the banks of rivers or lakes, even large snakes flee into deep pools at the bottom of valleys to escape. The centipede merely floats upon the water, restraining all who see it—there appears a dark green object, thin as a thread, descending straight into the water to where the snake lies. After a moment, the snake floats to the surface and dies. Thus, southerners grind centipedes into powder to treat snakebites, and the wounds heal immediately.\n\nSomeone asked, “In the mountains and valleys of Jiangnan, many poisonous creatures abound. Is there a way to ward them off?”\nBaopuzi replied, “In the Central Plains, the high plateaus have clear and harmonious *qi*, and the famous mountains of the central states are entirely free of such creatures. Yet in the wilds of Wu and Chu, where heat and dampness stagnate, even Mount Heng and Mount Huo—though sacred peaks—teem with venomous stings. There is also the *duanhu*, also called *yu* or *shegong*, which lies in wait to shoot its shadow. It is truly a peril of water. Its form resembles a cicada or a three-legged cup, with wings to fly, no eyes but keen ears. In its mouth lies a transverse object like a crossbow. Upon hearing human voices, it aligns this object like a crossbow and shoots *qi* as arrows, striking through water. If it hits a person’s body, a sore erupts; if it strikes their shadow, the victim falls ill but does not immediately develop a sore. Those who do not know the cure will die. The illness resembles severe cold damage, and within ten days, all perish.\n\nThere are also sand lice, found both on land and in water. After fresh rain or before the heat of dusk, one must be cautious when wading through water, for they inevitably cling to people. Only during scorching days or when the grass is dry are they rare. They are as small as the tip of a hair; once they attach to a person, they burrow into the skin. Their presence feels like a thorn’s prick—minor contact causes great pain. One can remove them with a needle; they appear bright red like cinnabar, moving upon the fingernail. If left unremoved, the insect will bore to the bone, then circulate throughout the body. Its effects resemble those of the *shegong*, and both kill. When traveling through areas with these insects, upon returning to one’s lodging, one should thoroughly scorch the body with fire, causing the insects to fall to the ground.\n\nIf one carries the Eight Substances—musk pellets, *Dushi* pills, *Fangming* pills, *Yuhu* pills, rhinoceros horn pills, *Qixing* pills, and *jini*—they will repel sand lice and *duanhu*. If these medicines cannot be obtained at once, carrying fine musk alone is also effective. Grind equal parts realgar and garlic into a pellet the size of a chicken egg and carry it; this is also beneficial. If already afflicted, applying this medicine to the sore will heal it. Chewing and applying the juice of red amaranth also cures it. The roots of *wuqie*, *xuangou* grass, and *ge* vine—each of these three can be used alone. Pound them to extract one or two *sheng* of juice and consume it.\n\nThe *shegong* hibernates in mountain valleys during winter. When heavy snow falls, search for it where the snow does not accumulate, where the *qi* rises as if steaming. Dig no deeper than a *chi* into the earth to find it. Dry it in the shade, grind it into powder, and carry it. In summer, it will naturally repel *shegong*.\n\nIf a Daoist knows the *Yi* prohibition method and constantly maintains the *Dongbai* prohibitions, guarding the True One, then a hundred poisons dare not approach, and no medicines are needed.\n\nSomeone asked, “When Daoists dwell in mountains, nestling in cliffs and sheltered valleys, they need not rely on warm, layered robes. How do they dare not fear wind and dampness?”\nBaopuzi said, “The *Jinbing* powder, *Sanyang* liquid, *Changxin* pills, *Xunhua* *naidong* decoction, *Duyao* ointment, *Yinyu* *xuanhua* powder, and *Qiudihuang* *xue* pills—taking any of these for no more than fifty days will enable one to resist wind and dampness for a decade. If one ingests the Golden Elixir and the Great Medicine, though not yet ascending to emptiness or becoming ethereally light, the body will be free from illness. Even when exposed to wind and dampness, they cannot harm it. These seven medicines are for those who have just begun to study the Dao.\n\nMaster Yao merely took the *Sanyang* liquid, then lay bare-chested upon the ice without shivering. These are the proven, secret methods of Master Jie and Liang Youdao, who slept upon stones and faced autumn and winter winds without harm.”\n\nSomeone asked about the way to cross rivers and seas to repel snakes and dragons.\nBaopuzi said, “When Daoists have no choice but to traverse great rivers, they should first, by the water’s edge, break a chicken egg, mix a small amount of powder with fragrant herbs, stir it into the water, and bathe themselves. Then they need not fear wind, waves, or dragons. Also, wearing the *Donghai Xiaotong* talisman, the *Zhishui* talisman, and the *Penglai* ritual repels all harm in water.\n\nThere is also the *Liujia Sanjin* talisman and the water prohibition. Another method: when approaching a river, first recite the incantation: *Juanpeng, juanpeng* [or *gonggong, fengfeng*], *Xiang Bodao, qian bi jiaolong, wan zai xiaomie, tian qingming*. The *Jinjian Ji* states: On the *bingwu* day of the fifth month, at noon, pound five minerals—realgar, cinnabar, orpiment, *bin* stone, and *zengqing*—into powder. Bathe in the Golden Flower Pool, then place them in the Six-One Divine Furnace and smelt them with cassia wood. When the copper is refined, temper it with hard charcoal. Have a boy and girl tend the fire. Take the *yin* copper to forge the male sword and the *yang* copper to forge the female sword, each five *cun* and five *fen* long, corresponding to the number of earth. This subdues water spirits. Carrying them while traveling on water ensures that dragons, giant fish, and water spirits dare not approach.\n\nTo distinguish *yin* and *yang* copper: Have a boy and girl pour water over the copper when it is red-hot in the fire. The copper will split into two pieces—those with protrusions are *yang* copper, and those with indentations are *yin* copper. Engrave them with their names. When entering water, wear the male on the left and the female on the right. If merely boarding a boat without wading into the water, wear the male on *yang* days and the female on *yin* days. Also, writing the *Beidi* script from the *Tianwen Dazi* on silk and carrying it repels wind, waves, dragons, and water perils.”\n\nSomeone asked about the method to repel mountain spirits, river deities, and the hundred *gu* in temples.\nBaopuzi said, “Daoists should constantly carry the *Tianshui* talisman, the *Shanghuang Zhushi* talisman, Laozi’s Left Contract, and guard the True One while visualizing the Three Generals of the Three Departments—then *gu* dare not approach. Alternatively, studying the *Lun Gu Lu* to know the names of all *gu* in the world, as well as the *Baize Tu* and *Jiuding Ji*, will cause the multitude of *gu* to retreat. Next, taking *chunzi* pills with red stone, *zengqing* *yeguang* powder, *congshi* pills, *wuyan* pills, swallowing white quartz, or the *Zhimu* powder will make one visible to *gu*, and the *gu* will fear them.\n\nBaopuzi said, “There are the *Laojun Huangting Zhongtai* forty pills and the true secret talismans. When entering mountains and forests, on a *jiayin* day, write in cinnabar on white silk, place it on a table at night, face the Northern Dipper, and make offerings with a little wine and dried meat. State your name, bow twice, receive it, and place it in the collar of your robe. This repels mountain and river spirits, the hundred *gu*, myriad spirits, tigers, wolves, and poisonous creatures.”",
      "overlap_context": "ape these two substances and apply them to the wound, and it will immediately heal. *Tan* is another name for the *zhen* bird. Also, southerners entering the mountains carry bamboo tubes containing live centipedes. Where there are snakes, the centipedes will move within the tube, so one should carefully inspect the grass and will surely see the snake. If a large snake, over a *zhang* long and a *wei* in girth, is encountered, the centipede can restrain it with its breath, and the snake will die.",

      "translated_text": "Why must only Daoists, in times of chaos seeking refuge in mountains and forests, know these methods? <*Baopuzi Inner and Outer Chapters*, Inner Chapters, Scroll Four>\n\nBaopuzi said, “The five talismans above are all the Lord Lao’s ‘Entering Mountains Talismans.’ Write them in cinnabar on peachwood boards, inscribing the characters so they fill the entire surface. Place them on doorways, the four directions, the four corners, and key locations along paths within fifty paces of one’s dwelling to repel mountain spirits, *gu* demons, and spectral beings. They may also be affixed to beams and pillars within the house. Whether one dwells in mountains and forests or enters them briefly, all may use them, and no creature will dare harm them. These three talismans may be inscribed together on a single board—this is not the method of the *Youshi*.”\n\nBaopuzi said, “This talisman is the Lord Lao’s ‘Entering Mountains Talisman.’ It may be affixed to beams and pillars within the house. All who dwell in mountains and forests or enter them briefly should use it.”\n\nBaopuzi said, “This is the ‘Entering Mountains Talisman to Repel Tigers and Wolves,’ bestowed by the immortal Chen Anshi. Write two talismans in cinnabar on silk, each distinct, and always carry four of each at one’s dwelling. When moving or crossing water, retrieve and take them along—this is a great divine secret. The ‘Mountain-Opening Talisman’ is named after the thousand-year-old *lüe* plant. When doors open, treasured books, ancient scripts, gold, and jade all appear—guard this secret. The method to the right is largely similar with minor differences.”\n\nBaopuzi said, “This talisman is the Lord Lao’s divine seal against the hundred *gu*, serpents, vipers, tigers, and wolves. Carve it into a two-inch square of jujube heartwood, bow twice, and wear it—it is highly efficacious, the talisman of the immortal Chen Anshi.”\n\nThese three talismans may also be affixed together on the left and right, front and back of oxen, horses, and houses, as well as pigpens, to repel tigers and wolves.\n\nSomeone asked, “Formerly, I heard of Tan Chang, who could walk upon water or dwell within it for long periods. By what method did he achieve this?”\n\nBaopuzi said, “Mix scallion sap with cassia and form pills the size of parasol seeds. Take seven pills three times daily for three years, and one will be able to walk upon water.”\n\nMaster Zheng said, “Simply practice breath-holding until one can sustain a thousand breaths. With time, one may dwell underwater for about a day. Carve a piece of true *tianxi* rhinoceros horn over three inches long into the shape of a fish and hold it in the mouth when entering water. The water will part three feet around, allowing one to breathe. True *tianxi* rhinoceros horn has a red vein like a thread running from base to tip. If a piece of this horn is filled with rice and placed among chickens, they will retreat in alarm before pecking within inches. Thus, southerners sometimes call *tianxi* rhinoceros horn ‘chicken-frightening rhinoceros.’ Placing this horn atop a grain pile prevents birds from alighting. On nights of thick mist and heavy dew, if placed in the central courtyard, it will remain entirely dry.\n\nThis rhinoceros dwells deep in the mountains. On dark, moonless nights, its horn shines brightly like a torch. When its horn is used to stir poisoned medicine into a decoction, white foam surges forth, and the poison’s potency vanishes entirely. If used to stir non-toxic substances, no foam appears. Thus, one may discern its efficacy.\n\nWhen traveling in foreign lands where *gu* poison is prevalent, always stir food and drink with this horn before consuming. If one is struck by a poisoned arrow and near death, carve the horn’s pattern into the wound, and foam will emerge as the wound heals.\n\nThe reason *tianxi* rhinoceros horn can neutralize poison is that the beast feeds exclusively on toxic grasses and thorny, bristling plants, never consuming soft or smooth vegetation. Once a year, it sheds its horn among mountain rocks. If one finds it and carves a replacement from hardwood, matching its color, grain, and shape, the rhinoceros will not notice. The following year, it will shed its horn in the same place.\n\nOther rhinoceros horns also repel evil and neutralize poison, but none match the marvel of *tianxi* rhinoceros horn.”\n\nOne may consume the *Six Wu Talismans* for a thousand days or compound the *Fengyi Water Immortal Pills* with red-spotted spiders and seven-layered water striders. Taking these allows one to dwell underwater. Applying them to the soles of the feet enables walking upon water. If mere head filth can make metal and iron float, how much more so these superior methods?\n\nSomeone asked, “Those who cultivate the Dao often dwell in mountains and forests, where tigers and wolves pose great harm. How may one repel them?”\n\nBaopuzi said, “Ancients entering mountains all carried the seal of *Huangshen Yuezhang*. Four inches wide, it bore one hundred and twenty characters. Sealing mud with it and placing it at the four directions a hundred paces from one’s dwelling kept tigers and wolves from approaching. When encountering fresh tracks, impressing the seal in the direction of the tracks would drive the tiger away; impressing it against the direction would make the tiger return. Carrying this seal while traveling through mountains and forests also dispels fear of tigers and wolves.\n\nNot only does it repel tigers and wolves, but if mountain, river, or earth spirits, or malevolent deities of shrines that consume blood offerings seek to bestow fortune or misfortune, sealing the mud to block their paths renders them powerless.\n\nFormerly, at Stonewater, there was a great soft-shelled turtle dwelling in a deep pool, lending the pool the name ‘Turtle Pool.’ This creature could manifest as a *gu* demon, afflicting people with wandering illnesses. A Daoist of Wu named Dai Bing once observed it. Using the *Yuezhang* seal, he made hundreds of mud seals, boarded a boat, and cast them throughout the pool. After a long while, a great turtle over a *zhang* in length surfaced, motionless. It was struck dead, and the afflicted all recovered. Many smaller turtles also floated to the shore, dead.\n\nWhen suddenly encountering a tiger in the mountains, perform the ‘Three-Five Prohibition,’ and the tiger will retreat. The method of the ‘Three-Five Prohibition’ must be transmitted orally, for brush cannot convey its intricacies.\n\nAnother method: visualize oneself as a vermilion bird, three *zhang* tall, standing atop the tiger’s head. Then hold the breath, and the tiger will depart. If lodging in the mountains at night, secretly take a hairpin from the head, hold the breath, and pierce the white tiger with it—there will be nothing to fear.\n\nAnother method: hold a knife in the left hand, hold the breath, and trace a square on the ground, reciting the incantation: ‘North of Mount Heng, south of Mount Tai, bandits do not rise, tigers and wolves do not prowl, city walls remain unbreached. Seal with a golden lock.’ Then lay the knife horizontally on the white tiger’s path—there will be nothing to fear for ten days.”",

Alternatively, employ the Seven-Star Step, the Jade Spirit Talisman, the Eight Might Talismans, the Five Victorious Talismans, the Li Er Talisman, the Great Peace Talisman, the Central Yellow Hua-Gai Seal, or burn sulfur powder and ox or sheep horns. Or erect the Western Marchmount Lord’s Mountain-Prohibiting Talisman—all have proven efficacy.\n\nThese four talismans are omitted here.\n\nThis talisman is the Old Lord’s Mountain-Entering Talisman, as described below. It may also be affixed to doorways, beams, and pillars. Whether dwelling in mountains and forests or entering them briefly, all may use it.\n\n**Earthly Perfection, Eighteenth**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: I have heard from my teacher that one who knows the One knows all things. To know the One is to know nothing that is not known. Not to know the One is to know nothing at all. The Dao arises from the One; its value lies in its singularity. Each resides in its own place, symbolizing Heaven, Earth, and Human—hence the Three Ones.\n\nHeaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; Human attains the One and lives; spirits attain the One and become numinous. Metal sinks and feathers float; mountains stand and rivers flow. Gazing, one does not see it; listening, one does not hear it. Preserve it, and it is present; neglect it, and it vanishes. Face it, and fortune comes; turn from it, and misfortune follows. Safeguard it, and it endures without limit; lose it, and life decays, qi is exhausted.\n\nThe Old Lord said: Dimly, dimly—within it there is an image. Vaguely, vaguely—within it there is a thing. This is what is called the One.\n\nThus, the immortals’ scriptures say: If you desire long life, guard the One; when hungry, the One provides sustenance; when thirsty, the One offers drink. The One has a name and a form: for men, it is nine *fen* in length; for women, six *fen*. It may reside two *cun* and four *fen* below the navel in the lower cinnabar field, or in the Crimson Palace and Golden Gate beneath the heart—the middle cinnabar field. Or it may dwell between the eyebrows, one *cun* back as the Hall of Light, two *cun* as the Grotto Chamber, and three *cun* as the upper cinnabar field. These are what the Daoists revere, guarding them across generations and transmitting their names only by word of mouth.\n\nThe One can complete yin and generate yang, regulate cold and heat, spring and autumn. In spring, the One brings forth; in summer, it grows; in autumn, it harvests; in winter, it stores. Vast, it cannot be measured by the Six Directions; minute, it cannot be compared to the tip of a hair.\n\nOf old, the Yellow Emperor traveled east to Green Mound, passing Wind Mountain, where he met the Purple Mansion Master and received the *Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns* to summon the myriad spirits. To the south, he reached Round Ridge and the Yin Jian Tree, observing where the hundred grains ascend, gathering the flowers of the *ruo* and drinking the waters of the cinnabar reins. To the west, he met Master Central Yellow and received the *Nine Additions Formula*, then studied with Master Broad Completion to receive the *Scripture of Self-Completion*. To the north, he reached Vast Dyke and Mount Juci, where he met the Great Hidden Lord and the Yellow Canopy Youth, receiving the *Divine Mushroom Chart*. Returning to the royal chambers, he obtained the *Golden Instructions of the Divine Elixir*. Arriving at Mount Emei, he met the Heavenly Perfected August One in the Jade Hall and inquired about the Dao of the True One. The August One said: “You rule the Four Seas—do you still seek long life? Is this not greed?” Their dialogue cannot be fully recorded; I roughly present one corner.\n\nThe methods for long life and immortality lie solely in the golden elixir; to preserve form and repel evil, only the True One suffices. Thus, the ancients prized it above all.\n\nThe immortals’ scriptures say: The nine-times-cycled elixir, the *Golden Liquid Scripture*, and the *Guard the One Formula* are all stored within the Five Cities of Kunlun, sealed in jade caskets, inscribed on golden tablets, bound with purple clay, and stamped with the Central Seal.\n\nI have heard from my teacher that the One resides in the Great Abyss at the North Pole. Before it lies the Hall of Light; behind it, the Crimson Palace. Towering canopy, golden towers, vaulted domes—left, the *Gang*; right, the *Kui*. Waves surge, skies soar; dark mushrooms blanket the cliffs, vermilion grasses twine the peaks. White jade soars; sun and moon hang their light. Passing through fire, crossing water, traversing the dark, treading the yellow—palaces and gates intertwine, curtains and jades gleam. Dragons and tigers stand guard; divine beings attend. It neither acts nor bestows; the One rests in its place. Neither slow nor swift, the One abides in its chamber. At ease, at leisure—the One does not depart. Guard the One, preserve the True, and you may commune with spirits. Reduce desires, moderate food—the One lingers. With blades at your neck, think of the One and live. To know the One is not difficult; difficulty lies in maintaining it without fail. Thus, one may endure endlessly, evade evil beasts on land, and repel dragons in water. One need not fear *wangliang* or venomous creatures; blades cannot strike, poisons cannot harm. This is the great outline of preserving the True One.\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: I have heard from my teacher that among the Daoist arts and scriptures, methods of visualization and concentration to repel evil and protect the body number in the thousands—such as containing shadows, concealing forms, guarding form without life, the Nine Transformations, Twelve Changes, Twenty-Four Births, and visualizing the various spirits within the body to make them visible. The methods are innumerable, each with its efficacy.\n\nYet some require visualizing thousands of things for self-protection, often so cumbersome they exhaust the mind. If one knows the Dao of guarding the One, all such methods may be discarded. Thus, it is said: “To know the One is to complete all things.”\n\nThe oral instructions for receiving the True One are clearly recorded. They are transmitted on a day of royal phase, with the blood of a white sacrificial animal, using white silk and white silver as pledges. A golden contract is divided—careless transmission renders the spirit ineffective.\n\nOne who can guard the One, the One guards in return. Thus, blades find no edge to strike, and a hundred harms find no place to lodge. In ruins, one may prosper; in peril, one remains secure.\n\nIn demonic temples, mountain forests, plague-ridden lands, tombs, tiger and wolf lairs, or snake-infested places—guard the One without fail, and all evils flee far away. If one momentarily forgets to guard the One and is harmed by the hundred demons, or is oppressed in sleep, immediately go to the central courtyard, gaze at the Auxiliary Star, clench the fists, and guard the One—the demons will depart.\n\nIn dark or rainy weather, simply remain indoors, face north, and visualize the Auxiliary Star. If surrounded by enemy troops with no escape, swiftly enter the Yin of the Six Jia, prostrate yourself, and guard the One—then the five weapons cannot harm you.\n\nOne who can guard the One may travel ten thousand *li*, enter armies, cross great rivers—no need to select days or hours, choose auspicious times to begin work, move houses, or enter new dwellings. One need not consult geomancy, star calendars, or avoid the General of Great Yin, the Monthly Builder, baleful stars, or the taboos of one’s fate—one need never fear calamity again.",
      "overlap_context": "secretly take a hairpin from the head, hold the breath, and pierce the white tiger with it—there will be nothing to fear.\n\nAnother method: hold a knife in the left hand, hold the breath, and trace a square on the ground, reciting the incantation: ‘North of Mount Heng, south of Mount Tai, bandits do not rise, tigers and wolves do not prowl, city walls remain unbreached. Seal with a golden lock.’ Then lay the knife horizontally on the white tiger’s path—there will be nothing to fear for ten days.”",

      "translated_text": "The Way of the Former Worthies has been tested through the ages and proven true. The *Baopuzi* states: \"The Dao of the Mysterious One is also an essential method. It wards off all harm and shares the same efficacy as the Upright One. My *Inner Chapters*, the first of which is titled *Changxuan* (Unfettered Mystery), refer precisely to this. Guarding the Mysterious One is even easier than guarding the Upright One. The Upright One has a name, a style, a fixed stature, and prescribed attire, whereas the Mysterious One is merely perceived at first and sought at noon—this is what is meant by 'knowing the white, guarding the black,' so that one cannot die even if one wished to. However, one must first purify and fast for a hundred days before one may await and seek it. It is obtained in no more than three or four days, and once obtained and guarded, it will never depart.\n\nWhen guarding the Mysterious One, one also visualizes one’s body dividing into three persons. Once these three are seen, they may be further multiplied to several dozen, all identical to one’s own body and clearly manifest. Each has its own oral instructions—this is the Dao of dividing the form. It is how Master Zuo and Jizi Xun, as well as the Transcendent Lord of Wei, were able to appear in dozens of places in a single day. There was once a host who sat with his guest, while another host greeted the guest at the gate, and yet another host fished by the water. The guest could not tell which was the true host.\n\nThe Master said: 'Guarding the One while cultivating the Bright Mirror—when the Mirror’s Dao is accomplished, one may divide the form into dozens of persons, all identical in clothing and appearance.'\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: 'The Master said: \"If one wishes for long life, one must diligently ingest the great elixir. If one wishes to commune with spirits, one must divide the Golden and Watery forms. Once the forms are divided, one may perceive the three *hun* and seven *po* within one’s own body, and the spirits of heaven and earth may all be encountered. The gods of mountains and rivers may all be commanded.\"\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: \"Life is to be cherished; death is to be feared. Yet those who cultivate long life, nurture their nature, and ward off death have never succeeded without beginning with diligence and culminating in enduring vision. Once the Dao is accomplished, there is little left to do. Before its accomplishment, there is nothing one does not do: gathering herbs and plants, toiling in mountains and marshes, decocting and preparing medicines—all require physical effort. One ascends perilous heights, crosses dangerous waters, and labors day and night without rest. Without the utmost resolve, one cannot endure.\n\nWhen one wishes to refine the Golden Elixir and ascend to heaven, the ingredients for the great medicine all require funds that cannot be swiftly obtained. One must rely on farming, herding, trade, or commerce to accumulate resources over years of toil before the elixir may be compounded. Even on the day of compounding, one must maintain purity, fast, and sever worldly affairs. The difficulties are manifold, and one must further apply oneself to spirit visualization, guarding the One, repelling evil, and protecting the body—ever as a ruler governs a state or a general faces an enemy. Only then may one attain the merit of long life.\n\nOnly those of keen intelligence and great wisdom, capable of bearing the weight of worldly affairs and aiding the common good, may undertake this practice and be certain of success. Mediocre and ordinary people, though they may have the aspiration and fondness for it, cannot persevere to the end. Thus, the body of one person is a microcosm of a kingdom.\"",

The spirit is like the ruler, blood like the ministers, and qi like the people. Thus, one who knows how to govern the body can govern the state. Loving the people secures the state; nourishing qi preserves the body. When the people scatter, the state perishes; when qi is exhausted, the body dies. The dead cannot be revived, nor the lost restored. Therefore, the perfected person eliminates dangers before they arise and treats illness before it takes form—healing in times of peace rather than chasing after what has already passed. The people are difficult to nurture yet easy to endanger; qi, though pure, is easily polluted. Thus, one must carefully assess authority and virtue to safeguard the altars of the state, and sever desires to fortify blood and qi. Only then may steadfast unity be preserved, the Three and Seven guarded, and the hundred harms repelled. Thus, lifespan is extended.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: \"The master’s teaching says that ingesting the great elixir of gold cinnabar, though one has not yet departed the world, keeps all evil at bay. If one merely consumes herbs, plants, minor remedies, or the eight minerals, it may cure illness and extend life, but it is insufficient to avert calamities from without. One may be afflicted by demons, slighted by the spirits of great mountains, or invaded by spectral beings. Only by maintaining steadfast unity can one fear none of these.

      "translated_text": "Should thieves yet find entry, how much more so when all gates lie open?\n\n*Far-Ranging Observations*, Scroll Nineteen\n\nSomeone asked: \"I, a humble man, have been confined by the walls of Confucian teaching, knowing only the Five Classics, the Three Histories, the words of the Hundred Schools, and the vain, florid poetry and frivolous essays of no benefit. I have devoted my thoughts to these for many years. Born into an age of manifold calamities, where chaos knows no end and weapons never rest, where literary arts are scorned and only martial prowess is valued, I have consumed the days of my two heavens in bitter toil, exhausting my thoughts on attack and defense, seeking escape—yet official rank eludes me, and I cannot even avoid the toil of the fields. Moreover, this has drained my vital essence, wasted my years, and brought no benefit to my lifespan. Now, with gray hair at my temples and old age upon me, my original aspirations have withered. Just as I wish to turn back and seek the Dao of life, sudden crises press in from all sides, leaving me no direction to flee, like one crossing a great river without knowing where to ford.\n\nYou, Master, have exhaustively studied the ancient canons and also mastered the arcane and esoteric. I wonder: among the Daoist texts, how many scrolls are there in total? I wish to know their titles.\"\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replied: \"I, too, once suffered from this same affliction. In the past, I was fortunate to meet a wise teacher, Master Zheng. My only regret is that I, his disciple, lacked the wisdom to penetrate the most profound and scale the loftiest heights. Though I served as one of his many disciples, sweeping and cleaning, my talent and insight were shallow, and I was still young and vigorous. My thoughts were not single-minded, and worldly attachments were not yet exhausted, so I could not gain much—this I still consider my greatest regret.\n\nMaster Zheng was over eighty at the time, his temples already streaked with white, yet within a few years, his hair turned black again, his complexion became full and radiant. He could draw a strong crossbow and shoot a hundred paces, walk hundreds of li in a day, and drink two *dou* of wine without becoming drunk. Whenever he climbed mountains, his body was light and agile, scaling perilous heights and crossing treacherous terrain—even young men could not keep up. His diet was no different from that of ordinary people, and I never saw him abstain from grain. I once asked Huang Zhang, a senior disciple who had followed him for a long time, and he told me: 'Master Zheng was once returning from Yuzhang when he encountered a great storm at Juegou浦. Hearing that there were many bandits ahead, his companions urged him to wait for reinforcements. Everyone’s provisions were scarce, so Master Zheng shared his rice with the group and did not eat again for fifty days—yet he did not hunger, nor did he show any sign of what he had done. I do not know by what means he accomplished this.'\n\nWhen writing small characters by firelight, he surpassed even young men. He understood music and was skilled at playing the zither. When sitting in leisure, he could converse with several people at once, answering their questions without pause, his voice clear and his hearing sharp. He could direct those playing the *sheng* and *se* to adjust their pitch without the slightest error.\n\nLater, I became one of Master Zheng’s disciples. When I requested to see his esoteric texts, he told me: 'The essential Dao fits on a foot of silk—this alone is enough to transcend the world; there is no need for more. Yet after broad study, one far surpasses those who have seen nothing. Moreover, understanding human nature allows one to teach simpler techniques to protect beginners who have not yet achieved mastery from various afflictions.'\n\nHe first gave me nearly a hundred scrolls of Daoist admonitions and precepts, showing them to me gradually. I had already seen many of them before, and for those I had seen, I often asked him about the points that puzzled me. Master Zheng said: 'You have the talent to discern truth from falsehood—you can be taught. However, though you know much, your knowledge is not yet refined. Your mind is set on external learning, and you cannot focus single-mindedly. You have not yet deeply immersed yourself in the classics or ventured far enough.'\n\nFrom then on, he promised to show me finer texts. He also allowed me to gradually obtain shorter writings copied on silk and fine linen. Over the years, the total I had seen should have amounted to over two hundred scrolls, yet I could never obtain them all. His other disciples were all tasked with menial labor—gathering firewood, plowing fields—while I, frail and weak, was unfit for such work. Unable to prove myself in other ways, I often swept, dusted, arranged his bed and desk, ground ink, held the candle, and helped him transcribe old texts. For this, he treated me the same as his senior disciples.\n\nHe told me: 'Every scroll of miscellaneous Daoist texts contains valuable teachings. One should only assess their refinement or coarseness and choose what to practice—not memorize everything, lest one waste time and exhaust the mind. Once the Golden Elixir is achieved, none of these will be needed. Yet sometimes, one must teach in a way that begins with the basics to encourage and guide learners, giving them a foundation to aspire to.'\n\nMaster Zheng would not allow others to copy his books. One had to memorize their essence. Even if he lent them for a long time, no one dared to steal a single character. Master Zheng was originally a great Confucian scholar. In his later years, he took up the Dao, yet he never ceased teaching the *Book of Rites* and the *Book of Documents*. His bearing was noble and upright, his demeanor dignified and proper. Those who met him all treated him with reverence. Whenever they had questions, they waited for him to soften his expression before daring to speak.\n\nThe texts I had in my possession for long periods—sometimes a month—were sufficient to transcribe much, yet I dared not secretly copy them. Precisely because Master Zheng was wise and discerning, I feared that if he discovered it, I would lose more than I gained. Even at the outset of receiving his teachings, I dared not act recklessly but only made requests when I deemed it appropriate. Thus, though I knew of drinking from the river, I could never fill my belly.\n\nAmong his fifty-odd disciples, only I was taught the *Scripture of the Golden Elixir*, the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, the *Five Agents Record in the Pillow*, and the like. The others did not even get to see the first line of these texts. Though I did not obtain all his books, I recorded their names. Now, I will tell them to you so that later generations who love these texts may seek them more broadly.\n\nDaoist scriptures include:\n*The Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns* (Heaven, Earth, and Human, three scrolls),\n*The Mysterious Writings* (Upper, Middle, and Lower, three scrolls),\n*The Scripture of Mixed Perfection* (two scrolls),\n*The Mysterious Record* (two scrolls),\n*The Scripture

      "translated_text": "Lord Lao could commune with the divine, and all talismans were bestowed by the divine. Yet few prove efficacious when used by people today, for their origins are distant, and errors have multiplied through repeated transcription. Moreover, if one’s faith is not steadfast, even correct talismans will fail to work. This is like writing characters: a miswritten talisman not only brings no benefit but may cause harm. Even in writing, people know that frequent copying leads to errors—hence the saying, “After three transcriptions, ‘fish’ becomes ‘Lu’ and ‘empty’ becomes ‘tiger.’” The difference between *qi* 七 and *shi* 士 lies merely in the length of a stroke or the hook of a line. Yet in talismans, the characters are unreadable, and errors go unnoticed, so no one knows whether they are correct.\n\nThere are also those who, by their innate constitution and mastery of technique, find talismans uniquely effective—just as some people, when using musk, naturally emit fragrance, a quality that cannot be transmitted. Even so, one must obtain an uncorrupted talisman and use it with a sincere heart; the effects will simply be slower than for those who employ the true method with innate skill. Still, there is always some benefit.\n\nGenerally, Daoists seeking long life focus on elixirs; talismans and swords serve only to repel demons and ward off evil. As for the claim that using certain great talismans can lead to immortality, this cannot be taken as definitive. In the Wu dynasty, there was a man named Jie Xiang who could read talismanic scripts and discern whether they were correct. Someone tested him by taking miscellaneous talismans for curing illnesses and exorcising demons, removing their labels, and showing them to him. He identified each one and corrected the errors. Since then, no one else has possessed such knowledge.\n\nSomeone asked, “Of all the great elixirs for immortality, none surpasses the Golden Elixir. I have heard your teaching on this—may I ask about talismanic texts? Which are the most important?”\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replied: “I have heard Master Zheng say that of all Daoist texts, none are weightier than the *Writings of the Three Sovereigns* and the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*. In ancient times, immortals, perfected beings, and celestial officials held this Way in the highest secrecy; it could not be transmitted except to those with the name of immortals. After receiving it, one must wait forty years before passing it on, swearing a blood oath and pledging one’s life as surety. These texts are found in all the famous mountains and the Five Peaks, but they are hidden in stone chambers in secluded ravines. Only those destined for the Way may enter the mountains and meditate with utmost sincerity, whereupon the mountain spirits will open the mountain, allowing them to see the texts. For example, Fan Zhongli found them in the mountains, set up an altar, offered silk, and always made a copy before leaving.\n\nOne must keep these texts in a pure and clean place. Before any undertaking, one must first report to them as if serving a lord or father. The scripture says: ‘If a household possesses the *Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, it will repel evil demons, pestilence, epidemics, and all manner of calamities. If someone is gravely ill and near death, a believer with sincere devotion to the Way may hold this text, and the person will not die. For a woman in difficult labor on the verge of death, holding this text will ensure the child is born safely. A Daoist seeking long life who enters the mountains with this text will be protected from tigers, wolves, mountain spirits, the Five Poisons, and all evil beings. One may cross rivers and seas without fear of flood dragons or wind and waves. Mastering its methods allows one to transform and summon laborers without needing to select auspicious days or locations. The household will be free from misfortune. If building a new house or tomb, one may write the *Writings of the Earth Sovereign* dozens of times, spread them on the ground, and observe the next day: where the yellow color appears, one may begin construction, and the household will surely prosper. When others are burying their dead, one may write the *Writings of the Human Sovereign*, include one’s own name, secretly place it in the coffin, and keep it hidden from others—this will protect the household from flying calamities and theft. If someone plots against you, the plot will rebound upon them.\n\nFurthermore, after purifying oneself for a hundred days, one may summon the Celestial Gods, the Controller of Destinies, the Year Star, the Daily Patrol, the spirits of the Five Peaks, the Four Waterways, and the deities of altars and temples. They will appear in human form, and one may ask them about fortune and misfortune, safety and danger, and the causes of illnesses and demonic afflictions. There are also eighteen characters that, when placed in one’s clothing, allow one to cross rivers and seas without fear of wind or waves.\n\nThe *True Forms of the Five Peaks* can repel soldiers and prevent harm from traitors; those who seek to harm you will instead suffer calamity. Daoists occasionally obtain this text, but if they do not practice benevolence, compassion, and sincerity, or if they are impure and unrighteous, disaster will strike, and their families will be destroyed. This text must not be taken lightly.\n\nAs for methods of transformation, the greatest is the *Five Phases Record* of Master Mo, originally in five scrolls. Formerly, when the Lord Liu was about to ascend as an immortal, he extracted the essentials and condensed it into one scroll. Its methods involve elixirs and talismans, enabling one to fly and travel freely through the earth and skies. Smiling turns one into a woman; frowning, into an old man; squatting, into a child; holding a staff, into a tree; planting objects, into fruit-bearing trees. Drawing on the ground creates rivers; gathering soil forms mountains. One may conjure traveling kitchens, summon clouds, and ignite fires—there is nothing it cannot do.\n\nNext is the *Subtle Writ of the Jade Maiden Grotto*, also in one scroll. It allows one to transform into flying birds and running beasts, as well as gold, wood, jade, and stone. It can summon clouds and create fog for a hundred miles. One may cross great waters without boats or bridges, divide one’s form into a thousand people, and fly high on the wind, entering and exiting without obstruction. One may exhale qi of seven colors, see the eight directions and the earth’s depths, emit light for ten thousand *zhang* to illuminate a dark room—this, too, is a great art. However, one must tread the paths of the stars through dozens of twists and turns, which few can master. The *Hongbao* and *Wanbi* of Huainan cannot compare to this text.\n\nThere is also the *Seven Transformations of the White Tiger*: take the skin of a white tiger killed on the third day of the third month, fresh camel blood, tiger blood, purple silk shoes, and duckweed. Combine and plant them on the third day of the third month. The first growth resembles garlic chives and bears fruit; plant this fruit, and with each generation, it will transform. After seven plantings, use the fruit to alter one’s form and appearance, allowing flight or submersion at will. This method is roughly similar to those of Master Mo and the *Subtle Writ of the Jade Maiden Grotto*; beyond this, there is nothing worth discussing.\n\nThis overview is for those who love the Way, so they may know the names of these extraordinary texts.\n\nMaster Zheng was not merely versed in the Five Classics and the Way of immortality; he also mastered the Nine Palaces, the Three Marvels, astronomical calculations, and the *He* and *Luo* writings. There was nothing he did not study deeply. In the first year of the *Da’an* era, foreseeing the chaos of the end times and the coming turmoil in the south, he carried his satchel of elixirs and entered the mountains. His disciples scattered eastward to Mount Huo, and none knew his whereabouts.\n\n*Dispelling Delusions, Chapter Twenty*\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: “One who seeks luminous pearls will not find the night-shining jewel of the black dragon in any but the depths of Hepu.”",

      "translated_text": "To seek fine jade, one will not obtain a foot-long bi-disc worth a city’s ransom unless from the caves of Mount Jing. To receive instruction in the Dao, if one does not find the right master but lingers in hesitation, hoping for some gain, or clings to the wrong teacher, one will ultimately achieve nothing—wasting effort, hindering progress. Though one may later regret it bitterly, it will be too late.\n\nEven in mundane, simple matters, one cannot gain knowledge by mere sitting; how much less so with the affairs of immortals and transcendents? Though one be sagely or wise, there is no way to comprehend them alone. They cannot be attained through prolonged reflection, nor sought by groping blindly. One must find a teacher who is both profoundly learned and broadly versed—yet even then, it is like scooping water from the vast sea or felling trees in an endless forest. The difficulty lies not in the scarcity of resources, but in one’s own limited strength.\n\nWhat tigers and leopards leave behind, raccoons and rats fight over. What Tao Zhu discards, Yuan Xian lacks. If one’s teacher is narrow in vision and shallow in learning, their knowledge will be inherently limited, their insights meager and unremarkable. What they treasure and keep secret is already imperfect; if they further dilute their coarse teachings to instruct others, how can any achievement be possible?\n\nIt is like borrowing grain from the gates of Boyi and Shuqi, or seeking warmth from the household of Qian Lou—what one obtains will be no more than acorns and coarse cloth, never a feast of prime beef or robes of brocade and fox fur.\n\nSome cling to mediocre teachers and never awaken; others, though fortunate enough to encounter a true master, fail to seek diligently. Such losses, born of unawareness, cannot be recovered. Discerning the depth of others is truly no easy task—this is why the ancients found it so difficult.\n\nWhite stone resembles jade, and the treacherous resemble the worthy. The worthy conceal themselves further, seeming as if they possess nothing, while the treacherous flaunt their emptiness as if it were substance. Without the utmost clarity, how can one distinguish between them?\n\nThose who persist with mediocre teachers do not do so because they recognize their ignorance and choose to remain; rather, they genuinely believe such instruction is sufficient. Those who encounter a true master yet fail to serve them do not do so because they grasp the master’s depth and cannot bring themselves to ask; rather, they genuinely believe there is no difference.\n\nFor one who truly knows the essential Dao is without desire for worldly things, does not chase after worldly praise—how then would they display themselves to the common crowd?",

      "translated_text": "The shallow and superficial, in their multitude, are often boastful and self-aggrandizing. They adopt stern expressions and rare tones to adorn their falsehoods, which suffice to delude and bewilder later learners. Boldly uttering grand claims, they declare they have ascended famous mountains and met immortals. Those who hear such words in haste, unable to calmly examine and verify them, seldom detect the deception.\n\nIn the past, I frequently encountered miscellaneous wandering Daoists flocking to the gates of the wealthy, instructing their followers to fabricate empty reputations, claiming they had already lived four or five hundred years. When someone happened to inquire about their age, they would feign ignorance, smiling and nodding vaguely, saying, \"I must be eighty or ninety now.\" They would then boast, \"I once fasted in the Hua Yin Mountains for fifty years, then spent forty years in the Song Mountains and Mount Shaoshi, followed by sixty years on Mount Tai. Later, I spent fifty years on Mount Ji with so-and-so.\" They recounted their experiences in such a way that, if one were to tally the years, they would indeed appear to have lived several hundred years. As a result, households fond of such tales would gather like smoke and mist, crowding at their doors.\n\nSome practitioners of arts might occasionally possess innate abilities to perceive spirits and deities, and could somewhat divine others' futures or past events, though in truth they could neither bring harm nor benefit. They were like divining stalks or tortoise shells—when people witnessed their minor accuracies, they would hail them as divine beings, believing them omniscient. Others might excel in talismanic water, incantations, or exorcisms, achieving efficacy in dispelling malevolence, yet remain ignorant of the Way of immortality. Some might practice miscellaneous arts and perceive spirits or anomalies, but such abilities did not prolong their lifespan. When questioned about the Way of the Golden Elixir, they were largely ignorant. Upon closer examination, one found that many deceived the world to amass wealth, stopping at nothing. These individuals, though differing in method from thieves who break in and steal, shared the same destination.\n\nThose who rely on empty words are not as credible as those whose deeds provide tangible evidence. To warn later learners and expose such deceptions, one may examine verifiable falsehoods.\n\nIn the past, there was a man named Gu Qiang who practiced herbal remedies and somewhat followed the methods of Rong Cheng and the mysteries of plain silk. At over eighty years of age, he remained sharp and not overly frail. People of the time thus called him an immortal or the \"Thousand-Year-Old Man.\" When Governor Ji of Yangzhou heard of him, he tested and welcomed him to Yidu. Upon arrival, Gu Qiang coughed and hesitated, as if his knowledge were vast but not fully expressed. Enthusiasts then amplified his reputation, and followers gathered like echoes responding to sound or shadows clinging to form, crowding around him. Offerings and tributes flowed incessantly, and his wealth rivaled even that of Luan Da, who was esteemed in the former Han. He regularly consumed asparagus root, which revealed that his body had never ingested the Golden Elixir or great medicines.\n\nGu Qiang had some acquaintance with books and was familiar with historical anecdotes. He claimed to be four thousand years old and spoke without shame of having seen Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang, asserting they were exactly as described. The common saying that Yao had eight-colored eyebrows was incorrect—his eyebrows merely stood upright like the character \"eight.\" Yao was tall and handsome, with a fine beard, and could drink over two *hu* of wine in a day. Later generations exaggerated this to a thousand goblets, but he could not have managed such a feat. I myself witnessed him thoroughly drunk on several occasions. Though a sage, as he aged, his governance declined compared to his younger years. When he saw the Four Assassins and the Eight Elemental Ministers, he relied on Shun.\n\nShun was merely a poor orphan from a humble family, yet possessed extraordinary talent. He plowed on Mount Li, fished in Lei Marsh, and made pottery by the Yellow River, but no one recognized his uniqueness. I saw that wherever he went, he transformed the people through virtue. His eyes had double pupils, and I knew this was the sign of a greatly noble countenance. I often encouraged and comforted him, saying, \"Do not worry about not becoming wealthy and noble—your great virtue is nearing its culmination. The mandate of heaven will surely be passed to you. If not you, then who?\" His father was utterly obstinate, and his brother was particularly wicked, constantly seeking to kill Shun. I once admonished them, saying, \"This child will prosper your family and bring blessings to the world. You must not treat him carelessly.\" Soon after, he received the abdication, and I recalled my words as having been proven true.\n\nI also said that when Confucius's mother was sixteen or seventeen, I divined that she would bear a noble son. When Zhongni was born, he was truly an extraordinary person—nine feet and six inches tall, his head resembling Yao's, his neck like Gao Yao's, and his eyebrows like Zichan's. From the waist down, he was three inches shorter than Yu. Though poor and orphaned, as a child he already loved ritual vessels. I knew he would surely accomplish great things. When he grew up, his lofty discourse astonished people, and learners from near and far followed him, with thousands enrolling to study. I delighted in his words and visited him several times, regretting only that my lack of learning prevented me from engaging in profound discussion with him.\n\nHe often urged me to study the *Book of Changes*, saying, \"This is an excellent book. I privately cherish it, having worn out three sets of bamboo slips and broken three iron awls.\" Now I have finally grasped its meaning. In the fourteenth year of Duke Ai of Lu, a qilin was captured in the west and died. Confucius asked me about it, and I told him this was not an auspicious omen. Confucius wept sorrowfully. Later, he had an ill-omened dream and wished to see me. It was the fourth month, and the heat was oppressive, so I could not go. Soon after, I heard he had fallen ill for seven days before passing away. To this day, I vaguely recall his countenance.\n\nI also said that when the First Emperor of Qin took me to Pengcheng and retrieved the tripods of the Zhou era, I told him, \"These tripods are divine objects. They emerge when virtue is present and sink when the Way is lost. If you cultivate yourself, they will come of their own accord, but they cannot be obtained by force.\" The First Emperor was greatly displeased with me, yet when he tried to drag them out, they could not be moved. He then apologized, saying, \"You truly are a man of far-reaching insight.\"\n\nI also clearly recounted the affairs of Emperor Gaozu of Han and Xiang Yu—such matters are too numerous to record in full. People at the time recognized them as jokes, yet when ordinary people heard them, they believed his words. Moreover, Gu Qiang grew increasingly senile, forgetting things. Governor Ji of Yangzhou once gave him a jade cup. Later, Gu suddenly told Ji, \"Master Anqi once bestowed this upon me.\" He later fell ill and died at Huang Zheng's home in Shouchun. Huang suspected he had transformed and departed, but after a year, he opened the coffin and found Gu's body still intact. All these were cases of fame without substance, causing the world to disbelieve in the existence of immortals, for such impostors confuse truth with falsehood.\n\nWu Wen, the Prefect of Chengdu, spoke of Cai Dan from Wuyuan, who loved the Dao but could not find a worthy teacher. He neglected his family and career, reciting day and night the *Yellow Court Classic*, the *Central Scripture of Supreme Clarity*, the *Observation of Heavenly Nodes*, and other non-essential texts from various schools, his mouth never ceasing. He believed the Dao was exhausted in these recitations, yet ultimately did not know how to apply them. He merely admired their florid rhetoric and, when meeting others, would teach them to simply read the texts a thousand times to grasp their meaning. After a long time, his family suffered hardship, their clothing and food depleted, yet he could not surpass others. Ashamed and resentful, with no way to justify himself, he abandoned his home, declaring he had achieved the immortal Dao.",

      "translated_text": "Thus fleeing to a remote mountain range in another realm, he knew nothing of gathering herbs or plants that could sustain him without grain. He could only sell firewood to exchange for clothing and food. For three years he endured hunger, cold, and hardship, yet when recognized by others, he would feign ignorance. Eventually unable to bear it, he returned home—blackened, emaciated, his bones protruding, no longer resembling a man. His family asked where he had been, and he could not admit he had failed to attain immortal Dao. Instead, he deceived them, saying, “I have not yet ascended to heaven, but have become an earthbound immortal. My rank is still low, and I must serve the senior immortals. Gradually, I will be promoted.\n\n“Previously, I was tasked by Lord Lao to tend several dragons. One was a mottled dragon, five-colored and the finest—it was Lord Lao’s usual mount. I neglected my duty, playing dice with the junior immortals, and lost track of this dragon. It vanished without a trace. For this offense, I was punished and sent to the foot of Kunlun Mountain to weed and hoe three or four *qing* of land, where the plants grew densely but were overrun with brambles. The labor was indescribably arduous. By law, I must serve ten years before being pardoned. Master Poxuan, Wang Qiao, and other immortals came to inspect my work. They pleaded on my behalf and even helped me, allowing me to return home temporarily to cultivate further and seek liberation. Thus, I will grow old and die here.\n\n“When I first returned, people asked about Kunlun. How did I answer? Heaven is not measured by its height in miles—when you look up, it is no more than a dozen *zhang* away. There grows the *muhe* tree, four *zhang* and nine *chi* tall, its ears heavy as cartloads. There are trees of pearl and jade, *shatang*, *langgan*, and *bigui*, as well as jade plums, jade pears, and jade peaches. Their fruits resemble ordinary plums and peaches, but they are luminous, translucent, and hard. One must wash them with water from a jade well to soften them before eating. When the wind rises, the branches, flowers, and leaves of the pearl and jade trees strike one another, producing the five notes of music—clear and mournful, stirring the heart. I saw exiled immortals who had heard of this, and none could help but feel sorrowful and grieve.\n\n“I also saw that atop Kunlun Mountain, each circuit has four hundred and forty gates, each gate four *li* wide. Within are five cities and twelve towers. Below lie green dragons, white tigers, giant serpents, and pythons stretching over a hundred *li*, their mouths and fangs as large as three-hundred-*hu* vats. There are wasps a *zhang* long, whose venom can kill an elephant. There are divine beasts—lions, *bixie*, celestial deer, *jiaoyang*, copper-headed, iron-browed creatures with long fangs and chisel teeth—thirty-six kinds in all. If one knows their names, no evil spirits or beasts in the world will dare harm them.\n\n“The deities there include the Headless One, Lord Daojing, Master Xilu, Lord Zhonghuang, and Minister of Deer Gate, Zhang Yang, styled Ziyuan. They guard the jade palaces and do not carry Lord Lao’s bamboo tally. Those without matching tallies on their left and right cannot enter. Five rivers flow from the mountain’s edges, and Weak Water encircles it—feathers cannot float upon it, and birds cannot fly over it. Only immortals may cross. Above dwell divine birds and horses—*youchang*, *jiaoxian*, *tenghuang*, *jiguang*—all capable of human speech and immortal. Truly, it is a joyous and swift immortal realm. I regret I could not roam there freely.”\n\nAt the time, many who heard Cai Dan’s words believed them clearly. Moreover, in Puban of Hedong, there was a man named Xiang Fangdu who, along with his son, entered the mountains to study immortality. After ten years, they returned home. When his family asked why, Fangdu said, “After three years of focused cultivation in the mountains, an immortal came to welcome me. Together, we mounted a dragon and ascended to heaven. For a long while, I looked down, but the earth was already distant. The dragon flew swiftly, its head raised and tail lowered, making me feel perilously unstable on its back. When we reached heaven, we first passed the Purple Palace, where golden beds and jade tables gleamed brilliantly—truly a place of nobility.\n\n“The immortals gave me only a cup of *liuxia* to drink, and I was no longer hungry or thirsty. Suddenly, I longed for home. When I appeared before the Heavenly Emperor, I lost my composure in reverence and was reprimanded, sent back to cultivate further. Only after accumulating more merit may I return.”\n\n“In the past, King Liu An of Huainan ascended to heaven and met the Heavenly Emperor. He sat arrogantly, calling himself ‘the solitary one,’ and was demoted to guard the Heavenly Kitchen for three years. Who am I compared to him?” Thus, in Hedong, Fangdu was called the “Reprimanded Immortal.” Many such frauds exist in the world, their deceptions varied and numerous—one cannot fail to examine them closely.\n\nThese absurd tales are so blatant, yet some still do not recognize their falsity. How much less can they discern subtler deceptions? Fraudsters often embellish their lies with plausible details. Without keen discernment, who can swiftly expose them?\n\nThere are also those who falsely claim to be renowned Daoist masters of past eras, like Bai He, who was said to have lived eight thousand seven hundred years before appearing in the world. Then, suddenly, he vanished without a trace. In Luozhong, there was a Daoist well-versed in many arts, skilled in numerology and alchemy. He posed difficult questions to Bai He, who answered them all effortlessly, leaving no doubts. Thus, he was regarded as a man of profound knowledge—though no one knew his true age, they believed he was nearly a thousand years old. Later, he vanished without a trace.\n\nThen, a man in Hebei claimed to be Bai He, and people from far and near flocked to serve him, bestowing gifts that made him wealthy. When Bai He’s disciples heard of his reappearance, they rejoiced and went to see him, only to confirm he was an imposter. The man fled.\n\nThe Five Classics and Four Divisions have become like straw dogs, discarded lees—mere traces left by feet, not the feet themselves. Books are the works of sages, not the sages themselves. Yet Confucians travel a thousand *li* with satchels to seek teachers. How much more should one diligently pursue the Way of long life, which true immortals hold in such esteem? Yet one must carefully distinguish truth from falsehood.\n\nI fear that frauds like Gu Qiang, Cai Dan, Xiang Fangdu, and Bai He will never vanish from the world. Those who delight in such matters should heed this book and refine their judgment of good and bad.\n\nThe *Immortals’ Classic* states that the pupils of immortals’ eyes are square. In Luozhong, I saw Bai Zhongli, whose pupils were indeed square—truly an extraordinary man.\n\n**Appendix:**\nNurturing the essence of the embryo and stabilizing the spirit are akin to guarding the primordial *qi*. One must merely refrain from obstructing the breath’s egress and ingress.",

      "translated_text": "Those who regularly practice may inhale *qi* through the nose at the time of its generation, then exhale through the mouth, expelling two parts while retaining one. They may then forcefully swallow this *qi*, causing a muffled sound in the throat—this is not the *qi* of the primordial embryo, but merely the ingestion of coarse *qi*. Coarse *qi* resides in the abdomen, yet does not dwell with the primordial *qi*. Coarse *qi* is the *qi* of panting breath.\n\nThough the primordial *qi* is scant and difficult to disperse, it does not rely on the ingress and egress of coarse *qi*. Moreover, one should not even wish to hear one’s own breathing—how much less should swallowing produce sound? When the inhaled *qi* is coarse, it injures the lungs, for the lungs are the canopy of the five viscera, and *qi* descends to reach them first.\n\nThose who ingest the primordial *qi* do not follow the coarse *qi* in its exit and entry, thus transcending the moments of *qi*’s generation and depletion. Yet when one forces coarse *qi* into the viscera of primordial *qi*, it instead harms the person. All who exert strength do so through the *qi* of the multitude—meaning the *qi* of myriad things and the essences of food and drink. This *qi* of the multitude can only lift heavy objects, traverse great distances, or move the body; it cannot prolong life when retained, nor shorten it when expelled. Why, then, should one prohibit or restrict it?\n\nThe art of employing *qi* is merely the use of coarse *qi*, which can shift mountains, part rivers and seas, subdue tigers and leopards, and ward off bandits. Thus, the *qi* of the multitude is inferior to coarse *qi*, and coarse *qi* may be dispensed with, but the primordial *qi* must not be allowed to depart.\n\nTo preserve *qi* is to preserve the primordial *qi*, not the *qi* of the multitude or the coarse *qi*. When the primordial *qi* fills the viscera, coarse *qi* is naturally expelled, and one may move with coarse *qi* alone, without need of the *qi* of the multitude. Those who practice abstention fear the steaming of the five viscera by grain *qi*, hence their avoidance of it. Yet once one cultivates the art of *qi*, grain *qi* is naturally dispelled—even if one eats nine meals in a day, it cannot become harmful, and even if one fasts for an entire year, it cannot cause emaciation or distress. Thus, the Dao of *qi* is profound indeed!\n\nDaoist exercises do not depend on establishing names, imitating forms, adorning appearances, or depicting images in diagrams. They are nameless and formless—whether stretching or bending, bowing or raising, walking or lying, leaning or standing, pacing or strolling slowly, chanting or resting—all are Daoist exercises. One need not perform them every morning; whenever the body feels unwell, one may practice them. In all cases, one should hold the breath, for holding the breath causes the *qi* to surge and circulate.\n\nOne need not wait to count breaths; when the *qi* feels nearly exhausted, first draw in a small amount through the nose, then exhale through the mouth. Since the *qi* has been held for some time, it will surge against the throat. If one does not first draw in more *qi* before exhaling through the mouth, the *qi* will become coarse and injure the lungs.\n\nOne should cease the practice once the illness is cured, and not induce sweating, for sweat leaves one vulnerable to wind and agitation. When practicing Daoist exercises, the joints may produce sounds—great movements yield great sounds, while small movements yield small sounds—this is the relaxation of sinews and the circulation of *qi*.\n\nDaoist exercises treat illnesses before they arise and harmonize *qi* that is not at ease. When activated, the hundred passages flow smoothly; when held, the blood of the three palaces congeals. Truly, they are the great discipline of nurturing life and the wondrous art of dispelling illness.\n\n*Baopuzi Inner Chapters*, Scroll Four\n*From the Daoist Canon, Baopuzi Inner and Outer Chapters*",

      "translated_text": "From the *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*, *Baopuzi Outer Chapters*, Scroll One\n*Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty*\n\n**“Secluded Excellence”**\n\nThe Master Baopuzi said: There was one who cherished the Recluse of the Mound—he disdained the restless wandering of the worldly, lamented the bitter toil of grasping and spitting forth, and relinquished lofty aspirations in the land of rivers and seas. Thus he tilled the soil himself upon the saline-alkali flats, concealing the six stratagems within his breast like a sealed sack, harboring jade-like brilliance yet never revealing it. His pure voice went unheard, his radiant artistry unseen by the world. He turned his back on the morning splendor of vermilion gates, preserving tranquility within his thatched hut, cutting off all ties with the golden halls of the Jin and Zhang clans, and nurturing his vast *qi* among the company of secluded worthies. He deemed glory and eminence misfortune, and jade and silk no more than grass and earth. His spirit soared beyond the clouds, defying decrees to embrace the ways of high antiquity. Sheltered by the towering peaks of lofty mountains, he rested upon the fragrant mat of orchids and thoroughwort, rinsed his mouth with the limpid essence of rosy clouds, and ingested the refined essence of the eight minerals. His thoughts were as boundless as if dwelling at the edge of the rainbow, his intent as ethereal as if abiding in the realm of inverted shadows. The myriad things could not disturb his harmony; the four seas were insufficient to agitate his spirit.\n\nThereupon, the scion of the Qi clan, moved by this, sighed in lament: “That a steed of unmatched stature should dwell in an empty valley is a disgrace to Sun Yang. That a talent of surpassing brilliance should be left behind in times of peace is the fault of those who recognize true worth. How can we allow such an outstanding man to preserve his solitary integrity, thereby depriving the sagely court of his presence?”",

      "translated_text": "Would the virtue of the great Yu and the wisdom of the Duke of Zhou ever find their use? Thereupon, he approached and expounded:\n\n“Merely to hear of one who flaps his wings and tenses his frame yet cannot soar through the nine skies, who plods toward the farthest reaches of the empyrean yet merely orders the common norms—such a one is no hero of towering stature. Now, sir, you wield resolute judgment as if grasping a gleaming blade, and your writings, resplendent as brocade, surpass even the rarest of texts. Your ornate phrases rival the flocks of birds and beasts, your dragon-like patterns emerge in the darkest night, your treasures of jade and coral lie hidden in the abyss, you lie dormant in the height of summer, and conceal your brilliance in the midst of spring. Though you lower your curtain to delve deep in thought, exhaust your brush in florid prose, subtly elucidate the Supreme Ultimate, and expound the primordial origin—when your words bring joy, even wooden effigies smile; when they bring sorrow, even clay figures weep bitterly. Yet if you weigh lightly, you are like a swan’s feather sinking in the Weak Waters; if you bear heavily, you are like jade and stone swept away by raging waves. In separation, even liver and gall become as distant as Hu and Yue; in union, the myriad differences merge into one harmony. In incisive discourse, you are as stern as autumn frost; in gentle speech, as tender as ice melting into blossoms. When you topple the lofty, even the highest peaks crumble; when you elevate the lowly, even the deepest pools rise in grandeur. Sheltering the pure, you lean upon the outer light of darkness; purifying the turbid, you instantly clarify the Yellow River.\n\nYet you cannot bestow great kindness upon the common folk, nor inscribe illustrious merit in the annals of the imperial house. Your name will vanish like morning dew, your body will dissolve like the ephemeral mayfly. In an instant, you may be exalted to the treasure of sages, yet forget the fleeting passage of time, lamenting the approach of old age. Such a path is not one you should choose.\n\nI have heard that the greatest are Heaven and Earth, next are ruler and minister, and the former sages, grieving for their times, sought to enact the Dao, restless even three months without a lord. Now, our sagely sovereign is of one mind with Yao and Shun, pitying the common people so that every household may be enfeoffed. Thus, some bear the tripod and ascend like dragons, others strike their horns and sing like phoenixes—no need to await the rush-wheeled carriage before acting, no need to wait for King Wen before rising. From the outset, the Five Phases wax and wane with the seasons. In advancement, there is the benefit of a clear path; in retreat, no entanglement like a wet fox’s tail. The wise preserve themselves, while those who propagate transformation succor the common folk. Let them follow the orchid’s fragrance and bend its stem, bathe in the limpid waves to dispel sorrow—like Shen Jing responding to the bright mirror, or the square and round conforming to compass and rule. Thus, merit reaches above and below, and grace extends to the eight directions. This is why the Tang dynasty stood so majestic, why Chonghua ruled with reverence, why the Lord of the West divided the realm, why King Fa revolutionized the age, why Huan and Wen unified the land, and why Gaozu of Han answered Heaven’s call. Never has there been a time when the gathering of worthies did not serve as the six pinions, or the reliance on heroes did not serve as the boat and oars.\n\nIf each were to cling to the loftiness of those who ‘wash their ears,’ or hold to the role of the plowman, then the transformative teachings of antiquity would not be established, the splendor of enlightened governance would not shine forth, the songs of wise rulers and good ministers would not be composed, and the vast net of Heaven would not be cast. Therefore, those who conceal their talents value adaptability; those who excel in seclusion prize the revelation of their uniqueness. In times of chaos, to hide one’s radiance and obscure one’s light in the clouds is to leave the brilliance of Heaven unmanifest; to sheathe the tiger’s fangs and grasp its horns is to leave its power to rend and tear unexpressed. If the great sword Tai’e lies hidden and unstruck, its decisive might remains unseen. If the swift Lü’er keeps its hooves still and does not gallop, its wind-chasing speed remains unapparent. To remain silent is to be no different from Zigong when mute; to close one’s eyes is to be no different from Li Zhu when blind.\n\nSir, you purify yourself yet overlook the disorder of the great moral order; you find contentment yet forget the duty to bring peace to those above. You remain bound by the mechanism of existence, yet leave no enduring name like metal or stone. Even the common man would flush with indignation—how could a man of true refinement remain indifferent?\n\nWhen the carpenter’s line is applied, the wood straightens; when Zheng music advances, the elegant withers. When Youyu was raised, the four evils were executed; when Confucius entered, the young Shaoyu was vanquished. The thunderous drum startles even the owl; when the sun rises, the firefly’s glow fades into obscurity. If you do not rescue those afflicted by the ‘summoning of souls,’ how can you display the extraordinary skill of the physician of Yue? If you do not aid a world beset by calamities, how can you reveal your uncommon and far-reaching capacity?\n\nTo sit in lofty repose and watch others drown is not the way of one who aids the world; to hold the Dao yet mislead the state is not the task of a true leader. If you wait for the grasses of mid-Tang to sprout in the morning sun, or the phoenix’s song to resound at dawn, if you await the solitary-horned beast to stand in the suburbs or the interlinked trees to cluster in the wild, then the long banners will remain furled, the weapons of war will stay sheathed, and Shaobo will retire from his achievements—who then will lift you up?\n\nAlas, how deeply you have sunk! I earnestly hope, sir, that you will not delay, but swiftly return.”",

      "translated_text": "Thus, Master Huai-Bing gazed afar in serene detachment, his spirit roaming the celestial thoroughfares, his emotions and thoughts drifting into boundless distance—seeming as though nothing existed beside him. He lowered his gaze and replied:\n\nAlas, have such words truly been spoken? The perfected person acts through non-action, dwelling in the void of the spirit, never enslaving their will to emolument or gain. Thus, harm and humiliation cannot touch them. They do not hesitate on perilous paths, so stumbling and downfall cannot become their affliction. Though coarse greens fail to suffice, their mind finds ease in a feast of a hundred delicacies; though they rank among the common and the lowly, their heart rejoices as if they ruled a kingdom. They sleep in the huts of Yi Liao, close the gates of Gan Mu, befriend Zhuangzi and Liezi, and dwell in humble lanes—steadfast as a mountain, unshaken. How could they harbor any concern for expansion or withdrawal?\n\nDesire, when broadened, muddies harmony, so they relinquish worldly affairs without entanglement. Those at the pinnacle of rank bear profound anxieties, so they turn from power and profit without lingering doubt. Their nobility does not depend on titles, their wealth does not rely on riches. They companion with clouds and roc-birds in lofty flight, never entangling their wings in the stench of rotting rats. They find true abundance in frequent emptiness, never altering their joy in a simple gourd and bamboo bowl.\n\nMoreover, the Way of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi stretches into the distant past, yet human life flashes by like a white colt glimpsed through a crack—swift as a shooting star’s fleeting appearance, fleeting as a flying arrow’s lightning passage. Why not roam freely in self-contentment? How could one torment the body for the sake of external things?\n\nThe kite does not entangle itself in nets; the unicorn does not fall into traps. Even birds and beasts know to avoid peril—how can those who wander in the dust fail to take heed? Consider Yao Li, who destroyed his family to render service; Ji Xin, who rose in flames to deceive Chu; Chen Jia, who slit his throat to prove his brother’s loyalty; Zhong You, who threw away his life to fulfill a pledge; Ying Men, who fell on his sword to lose his mind; Nie Zheng, who was moved by a zither’s lament to slaughter a lord; Jing Ke, who severed his shin to repay Yan and Chu; and Gong Han, who received a severed head in grief. All were the mad delusions of the profoundly foolish—how could the supremely wise ever choose such paths?\n\nThose with generous stipends bear heavy responsibilities; those with exalted rank endure mental toil. Thus, Zhuangzi fished with his line and ignored the honor of ministerial office; Bo Yi plowed with his plowshare and disdained the loftiness of feudal lords. Yang Zhu found peace in the butcher’s stall; the petty seekers of advantage remain blind to what is truly desirable. They gather without choosing the right tree; they serve without assessing the times. Greedily advancing, they do not consider the disaster of overreaching; accepting office, they do not weigh their inability to bear the burden. When discussing honor and nobility, they invoke Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou to save the drowning; when speaking of the perils of overreaching, they conceal the overturned tripod and refuse to remember. They watch for the river dragon to sleep so they may pluck its luminous pearl; they bask in the favor of the imperial measure, hoping for freedom from calamity. They indulge in the fleeting comfort of the water clock, blind to the inevitable danger. They covet the ephemeral glory of the morning mushroom, yet aspire to the longevity of the great tree. It is like treading thin ice in anticipation of summer’s heat, or climbing a rotten branch in expectation of a fierce wind. The deep-sea fish is lured by fragrant bait; the marsh pheasant swallows poisonous grain. They chew spoiled meat to fill their hunger, and guzzle poisoned wine to quench their thirst.\n\nIn ancient times, when Jizi saw ivory chopsticks, he wept; when Confucius heard the sound of an ominous bell, he sighed deeply. For they traced the beginnings to foresee the ends, and thus knew what was to come. Yet how can those who blindly step into the trap perceive what lies ahead? How can the allure of profit and desire grow ever more intense?\n\nKing Cheng of Zhou was virtuous, yet believed slander; the Duke of Zhou was sagely, yet fled to the southern lands of Chu. He entrusted his lament to the owl’s cry and barely escaped through the sealed golden casket. If even such enlightened rulers, who appear but once in an age, could face displeasure and slander at any moment, how much more so for others? Virtue does not rise like a violent wind to revive withered grain; affairs do not become weighty merely by bearing jade tablets. Alas, tears and lamentations come too late—how could it be otherwise?\n\nWhen gradual infiltration persists, even the strongest glue and lacquer dissolve; when prolonged soaking continues, even bone and flesh grow estranged. The accumulation of dust and feathers sinks ships and snaps axles; the repetition of slanderous words turns rumors into tigers. Jiang Chong, though base, was not kin to the crown prince; the stepmother, though a mere successor, was not close to Bo Qi. Yet the false accusation of digging up roots destroyed the bond of father and son; the deception of a singing cricket shattered the love of natural affection. How much less can one be certain of others?\n\nAlas, Wu Yun remained loyal yet his corpse drifted in the river; Bai Qi upheld righteousness yet slit his own throat. For when one sees through to the core, the heart grows cold—how could even a master craftsman not be confounded?\n\nMoreover, I would seek to extend my meager talents to echo the crowd, relying on my solitary correctness to reprove the many. Yet if I do not see that though metal can overcome wood, an awl cannot fell the forest of Deng; though water can conquer fire, a ladleful cannot extinguish a mountain ablaze; a drop of glue cannot clarify the Yellow River’s turbidity; a sliver of ice cannot cool the scorching heat of Xiao Qiu—then how can I not know that those who preserve both body and name are exceedingly rare, while those who first rejoice and later wail are many?\n\nTo fear the perils of overreaching yet not extinguish the desire for glory; to dread disgrace yet not dispel the impulse to contend—is like fearing dampness yet swimming in the deep abyss, hating one’s shadow yet avoiding all shade, drilling a hole in the boat to stop a leak, or adding fuel to quell boiling. The seven-foot frame is the vessel of life—one cannot return it maimed. The heart within the breast is governed by oneself—one cannot let it drift into dissipation.\n\nPlow the fields to eat; dig a well to drink. Wear coarse cloth to cover yourself; dwell in a humble hut for shelter. Sing and recite for joy; breathe deeply to prolong life. Roam freely among bamboo and silk; entrust your feelings to the brush of the Dao. Maintain constancy and await the end—this is enough.\n\nMoreover, when the Dao is present, one is exalted; when virtue prevails, one is noble. To cast aside a luminous pearl to shoot a sparrow—only a fool would do such a thing. Why must one seek prominence through power or wait for stipends to be sated?\n\nThose who are content in poverty consider the absence of wealth as riches; those who delight in humility regard not serving as honor. Thus, Ruan Ji floated on the sea to purify his spirit; Huzi was content to retire and plow. Pang Degong suffered punishment for his virtue; Xin and Wu were ensnared by charges of great merit. A single branch suffices to shelter the phoenix’s feathers—why need a vast forest? A shallow pool is enough to float the dragon’s scales—why require the deep sea? Coarse greens surpass the eight delicacies; a cold spring surpasses fine wine. Straw sandals outshine red shoes; a patched robe rivals imperial robes. Clasping one’s hands brings more ease than leaning on a staff; the rustling of branches brings more joy than strings and bamboo. A thatched cottage outshines vermilion pillars; uncarved rafters are more precious than ornate beams. Ascending Song Peak as one’s terrace; sheltering beneath a rocky overhang as one’s mansion. Accumulating writings as one’s granary; treasuring discourse on the Dao as gold and jade. Abandon the petty attachments of ordinary men; diminish the desires of the mediocre. Roam the nine marshes in joy; dispel worldly wisdom to transcend the vulgar. Like the inchworm, conceal your light; uphold simplicity and display clumsiness. Know when to stop and be content. Then, savor the fragrance of magic mushrooms; let your spirit soar with the floating clouds. Bask in the radiance of the nine suns; attach your wings to the lofty parasol tree. Look down to gather on the sacred isles—how could this compare to driving a chariot and crouching in the mud, or being draped in embroidered robes like an ox at sacrifice?",

If you wait for the grasses of mid-Tang to sprout in the morning sun, or the phoenix’s song to resound at dawn, if you await the solitary-horned beast to stand in the suburbs or the interlinked trees to cluster in the wild, then the long banners will remain furled, the weapons of war will stay sheathed, and Shaobo will retire from his achievements—who then will lift you up?\n\nAlas, how deeply you have sunk! I earnestly hope, sir, that you will not delay, but swiftly return.”",

      "translated_text": "Lord Qi Shi declared: To enter but never emerge is to be mired in favor and forget retreat; to depart but never return is to abandon office without righteousness. Thus the enlightened, knowing the body is not their own possession, entrust themselves to circumstance. Whether rising in prominence or dwelling in obscurity, whether speaking or silent, they hold nothing as fixed. When silk bundles fill the courtyard and torchlight blazes in the hall, the noble man’s Dao prevails. When fortune smiles like the sun at midday, they act. But when the age is plunged into the misfortunes of yang’s ninth phase, when slander triumphs, they do not step beyond their gate, sealing their mouths like a tied sack—useless. Dragons rise and phoenixes retreat, adapting to the times. This is why the ancients sometimes fled peril and chaos, refusing to enter, or took flight at the first sign of danger, not lingering even a day: they feared the fire on Mount Wu might consume orchid and mugwort alike.\n\nNow the sagely emperor governs the age, the world is level and the Dao at peace. Benevolence extends to all living things, his virtuous influence spreads far and wide, his awe-inspiring might reaches the four quarters. The nine realms are drenched in his grace; his earthly virtue bears all things with profound capacity. He solidifies the celestial vault with towering majesty. In divine transformation, clouds drift and rain descends; in mystical beneficence, primordial qi swells boundlessly. The four gates stand solemn and vast, welcoming all; the sovereign’s thought embraces the heroic and free, fostering good governance. This is a rare opportunity, a once-in-a-millennium turning point—and yet you, sir, cling to the lopsided path of reclusion, blind to the perils of excessive restraint.\n\nYou focus solely on cultivating inner strength like Shan Bao, never considering the threat of a tiger’s assault from without.",

      "translated_text": "Should one hear of a man drowning while fording a stream and thus declare all boats doomed to fail, or witness the treachery of Shang Chen and conclude that no heir to the throne is trustworthy—such reasoning is flawed. Master Huai-bing replied: “The flourishing of sagely transformation truly accords with your lofty discourse, yet the matter of withdrawal or engagement is a matter of individual inclination. When Yao and Shun reigned above, the Jishan and Yingyin valleys still sheltered recluses who dwelt in nests; when the Xia sovereigns governed the age, the remote gorges harbored worthies who grasped their ploughs. Did they truly fear such dangers? No—each simply followed what brought them peace.\n\nThus, one may exalt his resolve and refuse to serve kings and marquises, upholding the hexagrams’ symbols as a common man’s duty. Yan Zhou preserved his integrity, and the sages approved. As for me, I wander carefree among hills and gardens, withdrawing my traces to the wilds. My choice stems from this truth: my talents are not those of a statesman, and I lack the capacity to govern the people. Now, when a host of scholars arises like clouds, when the eminent and wise gather like scales, when the halls are filled with civil and martial worthies, and all affairs are at peace—why should I seek to cast my flickering light among the sun and moon, or strike a earthen jar beside a mighty bell? To offer a light fan in the season of solid ice, or a fur coat in the height of summer, would only hasten ridicule for untimely uselessness.\n\nYet if I devote myself to studying the classics and composing writings, I may preserve my authenticity, establish my name, and benefit the later age. If I force myself into what I cannot bear, I shall only stumble and fall, inviting blame and regret. Thus, like the little fox, I dwell in my strengths to safeguard my weaknesses. Though I possess no merits from serving at court nor toils from campaigning at the frontier, I still refine the young, cultivate the Dao, and nurture governance—different paths leading to the same end. I am no rigidly aloof man.\n\nEven the humblest may preserve his single integrity—how could I compare to Xu You? In this sagely age, tolerance is extended, and I am granted the same latitude as the recluses of the Tang. Is this not enough? Prince Qishi, suddenly abashed, composed himself and changed his expression, saying: “Sir, your words uphold teaching and aid instruction; your prose exposes deceit and resists perversion. You champion quietude to curb the restless competition of the age, and revive Confucian learning to mend the broken thread of discourse. Who but a man of emergence could order the constant norms? Who but a dragon could instruct the young? Under heaven, all are subjects—must only those who wear court caps and hold tablets be deemed right, while those who delight in hunger at rustic gates be deemed wrong?\n\nAre the masses not lost in delusion? Those wandering the vastness of Yunmeng must rely on the Southern Pointer to know the Way; those adrift on the boundless sea must gaze upon the North Star to find their return. Now, having heard your noble instruction, I perceive my blindness. I shall don my robes and cap, take up my humble steed, and aspire to the raft of universal love, advancing without prejudice in my choices.”\n\n**The Recluse, Part Two**\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: “In times past, I wandered...”",

Fearful of fullness, he resists contemplation; unmindful of the chaos near at hand, he shuns the shallow perils of ox tracks only to plunge into the unfathomable blades of a hundred knives. He flees the muddy shallows where feet may wet, yet casts himself into the furnace’s fire, all unawares.”\n\nThe recluse replied: “He who sharpens his resolve on fledgling mice knows not the purpose of the *zōuyú*; he who triumphs in gleaning courtyard grains cannot fathom the distant aim of the phoenix and simurgh.

Is not your seclusion, sir, perilous indeed?’\n\nThe recluse answered: ‘Lu Shang excelled in waging war but fell short in governing the state. He could not emulate the profound Yellow Emperor, whose virtue embraced heaven and earth, nor match the vastness of the seas and mountains in honoring worthies and esteeming virtue. Delighting in nurturing talent, he yet took pleasure in execution, neglecting benevolence and righteousness. Thus, the calamity of his slaughter took root from the moment of his enfeoffment. When the Duke of Zhou heard of this, he knew his state would not endure.\n\n‘For attack and defense demand different dispositions; the Dao prizes adaptability. Yet Lu Shang lacked the art of boiling scales to draw forth distant steeds, nor did he possess the reins to guide far-reaching governance. He thrust forward the tactics of battle arrays, loathing those of lofty integrity—relying on armor to perfect his blades, and further, on swimming to shoot fleeing foes. Could he truly have hoped to aim at the mark with such measures?\n\n‘Tilt the nest of common birds, and the numinous phoenix will not alight; drain the pool of fish and turtles, and the divine dragon will flee afar. Rip open the wombs of ordinary beasts, and the qilin will not stand in their fields. Harm even a single scholar, and the heroic will not tread your land. Lu Shang founded a dynasty and bequeathed its legacy to posterity, yet he unfurled the banner of harsh cruelty, unsealed the casket of savagery—just enough to drive the talented to serve other states, to chase away the worthy and leave them to enemy hands.\n\n‘How far removed is this from those who bought the bones of a dead steed to attract swift hooves, or bowed in humble lanes to repel Qin’s armies! What say you, sir—how does Lu Shang compare to the Duke of Zhou?’\n\nThe scholar replied: ‘I cannot judge.’\n\nThe recluse said: ‘The Duke of Zhou, a great sage, humbled himself before the lowly: he would spit out his food and grasp his hair, fearing to lose men. From thatched huts, seventy scholars came; from among commoners, he took disciples, ten of whom he treated as teachers, twelve as friends—all drawn to court by his gravity.\n\n‘Had Lu Shang occupied the Duke of Zhou’s place, these men would have become corpses strewn in the marketplace, carcasses rotting in ditches. Yao could have compelled Xu You and Chao Fu to serve; Shun could have coerced Shan Juan and the men of Stone Gate; Yu could have forced Bo Chengzi Gao; Tang could have pressed Bian Sui and Wu Guang; King Wen of Wei could have bent Gan Mu; and Duke Ping of Jin could have pressed Hai Tang. Yet they honored and set them free, esteemed and held them in weight—not because the six rulers were weak, but because the hundred virtues differ in their heights, and silence is hard to equal.\n\n‘They admired the beauty of honoring worthies, shamed the ugliness of harming the good. To employ such men would not have increased their might; to cast them aside would not have left their offices empty. Following their resolve could spread refined customs and foster flourishing virtue, spurring the greedy to withdraw and shaming the reckless. Though their talents might not suffice for immediate use or match the finest at court, was this not better than cringing and fawning, flattering the powerful, clutching gifts and bearing bribes, racing through the night to vie for favor, scrambling for passage, trading in fame, discarding virtue and conduct for the root of literary learning, or rushing to join the clamor of partisan factions?\n\n‘If even those six rulers would not press their words upon reclusive scholars, would they have resorted to the blade? The sages are truly worthy of emulation—Lu Shang was clearly in error.\n\n‘Though Emperor Gao of Han had many flaws in his conduct and little acquaintance with the classics, his magnanimity was vast, his tolerance boundless. He did not press the Four Elders of Mount Shang, though he hungered and thirsted for them. Only when the crown prince humbled himself to invite them did he make them his wings. He revered virtue, restrained his emotions, mourned the yellow swan with a sorrowful song, and thwarted his concubines’ ambitions. Such was his esteem for worthies—no wonder he rose from commoner to rule the realm. His capacity surpassed others indeed.\n\n‘As for Lu Shang’s execution of Hua Shi, it was out of fear that he would discourage the masses. Yet the true affliction of the age—does it lie in this?’”",

The Four Hermits of Mount Shang lived in the same age as Chao Fu and Xu You, yet Wang Mang shared his era with the two Gong brothers—none could follow their example. Even if the common folk were flogged and shamed, forced to pursue the likes of Hua Shi, they would still refuse. How, then, could Lu Shang fear that Hua Shi would corrupt the masses? Failing to grasp this, he applied military law to a time of peace, wrongfully harming a worthy—his cruelty was grievous indeed. Only his great achievements prevented his downfall.\n\nMoreover, before Lu Shang met King Wen, he too endured poverty and lowliness. The common crowd despised him; an old woman drove him away. His hired labor went unsold; his butchery and angling brought no gain. Not a single soul admired him. In his reclusion, why did he alone fear that Hua Shi would discourage the masses? Had King Zhou of Yin fled and sought refuge, would Lu Shang, even at the point of death, have called it a crime? Cao Cao, too, enforced harsh laws and was swift to kill, yet in his heart he sought to employ Kongming. Kongming plainly declared he had no wish to serve, and Cao Cao dismissed him, saying, “It would be wrong to humiliate a man of lofty character in the court of a corrupt ruler.” Though Cao Cao lashed the Nine Provinces and laid the foundations of an empire, he did not act recklessly.\n\nYet as turmoil persisted and competition became custom, some thrust themselves forward with bribes like dragons leaping, while others ascended through factional ties like phoenixes soaring. Wind shapes habit, and custom obscures the great Dao. Later generations, ignorant of the teachings of the Ru, came to believe that wealth alone could establish one’s person. When a man of outstanding integrity, who never leaves his home yet quietly savors the Dao, appears, should he not be sought out and honored to revive the virtue of humility?\n\nIf Sun Wu and Wu Qi bore arms, their strength was that of a single man, yet their strategies surpassed those of ten thousand. Now, if a great Ru were sent as an emissary—not to handle pressing affairs but to teach in the mountains and forests—could he not mold the young and expound the refined rites of reverence? Why must one harness a great elephant to catch a mouse or saddle a phoenix to ride? Then the bells and tripods would resound with his name. As for those who wither in the marshes and thickets, who live and die in vain—what worth do they hold?\n\nThe recluse replied: “You may be said to guard a molehill and play upon a fox mound, never having ascended the heights of Langfeng to gaze upon the clouds, nor floated upon the limpid shallows to cross the Milky Way. The so-called men of aspiration need not seek office, nor must they strive for merit and fame. The highest attain the nameless; the next, the unnameable. They soar on wings to surpass the crowd, their tracks vanish like a wheel’s hub—doing what ordinary men cannot, severing what those of mediocre talent cannot sever. Whether few or many, they are not measured by common standards. Serene and pure, they are unstained by fame or rank. Their pure influence is enough to cleanse the filth of a hundred generations; their lofty standards are enough to rouse the turbid men of later times. Why must they don crimson sashes and purple robes, wear crowns and ride carriages, adorn themselves with the embroidered hides of sacrificial oxen, or swallow the fragrant bait of Zhan He? One morning they blaze like the scorching sun, by evening they crumble into cold ashes.\n\nThe sparrow does not trade its thorny thicket for the distant clouds; the king salmon does not abandon its deep pool for the vastness of the sea. Tigers and leopards enter grand halls and grieve; swans and cranes ascend the peaks of Song and grow sorrowful. Each creature finds peace in what it excels at—none rejoices in success or mourns in loss. The men of the world, however, are all like this: a single day without a lord leaves them restless and anxious. They are like the jade piled in Lantian or the timber filling Deng Forest—though skilled craftsmen and great artisans may use them as they please, why must one drown fish or sink birds?\n\nNoble reclusion and lofty withdrawal were approved by the ancient sages. Some emerge, some withdraw—each follows his own inclination. What the scholar values is the establishment of virtue and the creation of teachings. To practice filial piety, friendship, benevolence, and righteousness, to maintain purity and loftiness—this is to establish virtue. To exhaustively study the ancient texts and produce writings of brilliance—this is to establish teachings.\n\nShanjuan had no merit in governing the people, yet he cannot be said to have diminished the customs of the age. Confucius had no achievements in warfare, yet he cannot be said to have fallen short of Han Xin or Bai Qi. To preserve both name and person intact is the highest worthiness; to dwell in reclusion and fulfill one’s aspirations surpasses even the ancients. Boyi and Shuqi, though inflexible in their principles, were praised by the ancients for not lowering their aspirations or humiliating themselves. Not lowering their aspirations shows they esteemed the loftiness of reclusion; not humiliating themselves shows they knew the defilement of bondage.\n\nThe purity of the sages was praised by Mencius, who also said that the heavenly nobility surpasses official seals. To cultivate one’s aspirations and forsake glory was esteemed by Xunzi. When the weight of the Dao and righteousness is recognized, kings and dukes may be held lightly. Yet what the world fears is power, what it values is profit. Those of great virtue who remain obscure are dismissed as mediocre; those of small capacity entrusted with great tasks are hailed as lofty scholars. Some risk danger, brave peril, cast aside their lives, and hurl their bodies beneath a thousand blades—all to seize glory and splendor in a single morning. Compared to those who scorn the four seas and cherish their own necks, how deluded they are!\n\nOne who serves the world says: ‘The reclusive scholar, content in the mountains and marshes, does not bear the world’s honors. Unfettered and unrestrained, he is of no use to his age. To covet rank and profit is truly a useless thing in the world.’ The recluse replied: ‘The unicorn does not bark, the phoenix does not herald the dawn, the celestial steed does not pull the plow, and the ancestral priest does not manage the kitchen. Moreover, the sun shines with great brightness, illuminating all without exception, while the nurturing warmth of the gentle wind is the work of the moon.’”",

He revered virtue, restrained his emotions, mourned the yellow swan with a sorrowful song, and thwarted his concubines’ ambitions. Such was his esteem for worthies—no wonder he rose from commoner to rule the realm. His capacity surpassed others indeed.\n\n‘As for Lu Shang’s execution of Hua Shi, it was out of fear that he would discourage the masses. Yet the true affliction of the age—does it lie in this?’”",

The world cannot endure for long without the sun, nor can it last a single day without fire, yet their magnitudes cannot be equated.\n\nBeyond the rivers and seas, the vastness of heaven and earth unfolds: rising as clouds and rain, descending to form the hundred streams. Yet the daily use of these great waters does not match the irrigation of a well’s shallow blade, nor does the flooding of fields and gardens compare to the nourishment of a humble ditch. Which, then, is truly vast?\n\nJie and Zhou were emperors, while Confucius was but a minister’s minister. Yet when men are likened to Jie and Zhou, none fail to rage, while to be compared to Confucius brings universal delight. Thus, nobility and baseness do not lie in rank alone.\n\nMencius said: “Were Yu, Ji, and Yan Yuan to exchange places, they would all act the same.” Zai Yu also declared Confucius far greater than Yao and Shun. If commoners and kings are weighed equally, and scholars exalted above all, then the virtue of the Tang and Yu dynasties was virtue alone—what need had it for office?\n\nMoreover, when the sun’s brilliance ascends through creation, turning heaven and earth within its embrace, the mind remains vast and unburdened by worldly affairs. When the pure and white is untouched by glory or disgrace, the desires of the vulgar cannot gladden the spirit, nor can the confusions of the crowd sway one’s resolve. Glory and splendor are but growths to be excised, and the ten thousand things no more than the wings of a cicada.\n\nWould one of such disposition deign to bend his limbs, bow his bearing, and measure his conduct by what displeases him? Would he labor over what he has cast aside, force a smile to advance, or cringe to retreat—fearing the displeasure of the vulgar or the wear of his own body? Would he dull the Dragon Spring sword into an awl, mute the sacred drum into a child’s toy, wield the Yellow Thearch’s scepter as a sickle, or lower the imperial banner beneath the branches of the scholar’s tree?\n\nKing Gu of old cast aside his staff and fled, while Yu Yi entered a cave to escape. Ji Zha withdrew to till the fields, and Lao Lai irrigated gardens to keep his distance.

      "translated_text": "Should one cleave the tally and hold land, what is called emolument and gain is but a semblance—no true wealth or nobility. Moreover, the higher the office, the heavier the burden; the greater the merit, the more men envy it. Only in poverty and lowliness does none contend with me, allowing one to treasure it long and live without care.\n\nTo wash one’s furs and mend coarse cloth, to tend mallows and discard weaving, to leave beans uncovered and dine on rough grain—this may invite the scorn of those who fawn and dissemble. Yet to erect screens and seal off chambers, to feast on three returns of jade-laden dishes and the luxuries of marquises, to bask in the ease of Anchang—this brings the burden of usurping rank and wallowing in filth. Better to wander in the canon of the spirit, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, seeking only to fill the belly. At the tip of the plowshare or amidst the threads of the loom, one gazes at the river and is sated; the body gathers to a single branch and rests in abundance. The teeming ten thousand things crumble into dust and ash.\n\nGruel to fill the mouth, hempen robes and patched gowns—such plainness frees the will, neither sorrow nor joy. This is true honor and joy, likened to having nothing at all.\n\nAs for office: if one seeks a name, then inscribing a hair suffices to bear one’s surname—why rely on the good historian or the engraving of tripods? Mencius did not count arrows and stones as merit; Yang Yun did not seek to enrich the age by governing the people. To seek benevolence and attain it—is this not enough?\n\nYet the official says: “Those who flee the world are disloyal; how can they dwell in the ruler’s land and eat the ruler’s grain?” The recluse replies: “What do you mean? When Yan Hui died, Duke Ding of Lu was to offer condolences in person. He sent someone to consult Confucius, who said: ‘All within the seas are subjects.’ Duke Ding then ascended by the eastern steps and performed the rites of a lord. By this reasoning, all within the shores are the king’s subjects—this much is clear. Those at court exert their strength to serve; those in the mountains and forests follow virtue to curb greed. Though the paths of purity and turbidity differ, their return is the same: all are subjects. The king knows no bounds; the world is his home. Where the sun and moon shine, where rain and dew fall—all is his domain. How can one suspend oneself in empty space, feed on sips of rosy clouds, and refuse to dwell within it?

Reclusive scholars, not ranked among meat-eating officials, are like the treasures of mountains and waters. Are they not also possessions of the state? Xu You did not flee beyond the four seas; the Four Hoary Ones did not escape to the farthest wilds. Thus it is said: “All within the realm, from the noble to the humble, are the emperor’s subjects.” Gan Mu did not bear arms to guard the frontier or build ramparts on the battlefield, yet he rendered the service of strengthening Wei. Now, those who dwell in reed huts within the realm, chanting the Way of the former kings, teach the people the virtue of yielding—if Confucian and Mohist teachings do not decline, this too is what Yao and Shun would approve.\n\nIn the past, Boyi and Shuqi refused to eat Zhou grain, and Bao Jiao starved to death beneath a bridge—how can their stubbornness serve as a model? Formerly, Emperor An sent dark silk and jade to summon Zhou Yanzu; Emperor Huan sent dark silk and jade to summon Wei Xiuming; Emperor Shun sent dark silk and jade to summon Yang Zhongxuan. Each accepted the appointment as Attendant Gentleman but did not take office. Emperor Wen of Wei summoned Guan You’an, who also refused. He then decreed that local authorities annually provide one sheep and two *hu* of wine. Emperor Huan sent dark silk and jade to summon Xu Shuzi, who accepted the post of Governor of Taiyuan and Minister of the East Sea but did not assume office. Emperor Shun sent dark silk and jade to summon Fan Jigao, who declined, prompting the decree that local authorities annually provide one sheep and two *hu* of wine, along with a ceremonial desk and staff, treating him with the rites due a teacher. In Emperor Xian’s time, Zheng Kangcheng was nominated by the province as Filial and Incorrupt, Outstanding Talent, and Excellent and Upright, and summoned fourteen times by the Three Ducal Ministers—all of which he declined. The imperial carriage summoned him as Gentleman Consultant, Erudite, Minister of the Capital, Attendant Gentleman, and Grand Minister of Agriculture—none of which he accepted. Emperor Zhao’s imperial carriage summoned Han Fu, who arrived and was granted fifty bolts of silk, along with sheep and wine. Fa Gaoqing was twice nominated as Filial and Incorrupt, five times summoned by his province, eight times by the Three Ducal Ministers, nine times as Excellent and Upright, and three times as Erudite—all of which he declined. Emperor Huan sent dark silk, jade, a covered carriage, and a light chariot to summon Han Boxiu, who did not come; he sent the same to summon Jiang Boya, who accepted the post of Palace Grandee but declined the governorship of Fang—yet all were treated with esteem and not subjected to coercive summons.\n\nIf these emperors’ commendation of reclusive scholars was not misguided, then the execution of Hua Shi by Lü Shang was excessively harsh and cruel—this much is clear.

      "translated_text": "**Exhortation to Study (III)**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: Study is the means to clarify and settle the nature and principle of the mind, to winnow away the dust and grime, to carve and polish the unrefined ore, to sharpen the dull blade, to awaken the Dao and brighten the intellect, to adorn and dye the plain silk, to examine the past and foresee the future, to range widely and encourage achievement, to look up and observe, to look down and scrutinize—all of which lie within the purview of the kingly Way. Advancing, one may govern the state; retreating, one may preserve oneself. Thus, the sages and worthies were all untiring in their diligence, striving day and night without cease, studying until the water-clock ran dry and the sun stood at noon without laying aside their books, enduring hunger and cold, peril and hardship without abandoning their pursuit. How could this be for the sake of seeking favor in the present age? Truly, it is the natural joy of the endeavor itself.\n\nThe shallow skills of carving and engraving, the easy arts of archery and charioteering, still require habitual practice before one can master them—how much more so the vastness of human principles, the profundity of the Dao and virtue, the transformations of yin and yang, and the subtleties of spirits and gods, distant and obscure, dark and recondite, truly difficult to comprehend! Though one may say a color is white, without dyeing it will not be lustrous; though one may say a taste is sweet, without blending it will not be savory. Thus, the jade flower, if left unpolished, will not emit its radiance by night; the crimson blade, if left untempered, will not achieve the strength of the pure steel sword. Fire, if not drilled, will not ignite; if not fanned, will not blaze. Water, if not channeled, will not flow; if not accumulated, will not run deep. Though the raw material lies within me, its completion depends on external means.\n\nOnly by ascending the Towering Wind and grasping the Pillar of Dawn does one realize the gloom and narrowness of the well and valley. Only by perusing the Six Classics and savoring the Hundred Schools does one perceive the utter blindness of facing a wall. To seek knowledge without study is like desiring fish without a net—though the mind may toil, there will be no harvest. To pursue breadth and exhaust principle is like entrusting oneself to a following wind—without bodily labor, one may reach far.\n\nCosmetics, when applied, enhance the beauty of Xi Shi and conceal the ugliness of the wen; profound learning in the classics, when deep, allows the brilliant to soar freely and the dull to awaken. The catalpa and nanmu may soar to the clouds, yet without the craft of Lu Ban, they cannot become towers and pavilions. A man may be naturally bright and clear, yet without understanding the right and wrong of great principles, he cannot be called a gentleman.\n\nTo surpass a thousand *li* in a single morning, one must rely on the swiftness of Retreat Shadow’s steed. To cross the vast waves and reach distant shores, one must depend on the vessel and oars. To see beyond all bounds without descending from the hall, one must turn to the written records. To fathom the depths of the abyss without exhausting the spirit, one must find a luminous teacher. Thus, cinnabar and verdigris transform plain silk; instruction dispels ignorance. When one parts the dark clouds and raises the great light, the forms of the ten thousand things are revealed without concealment. When one unfurls the bamboo and silk and examines past and present, the secrets of heaven and earth are laid bare—how much more so the workings of spirits and gods, and even more, the affairs of men!",

      "translated_text": "Can mud be made as hard as lacquer? Can gold, jade, or crooked wood be worked to meet the carpenter’s square? Can the hundred beasts be trained for battle formations? Can the six livestock be taught to advance and retreat? Can deep-swimming fish be moved by sound? Can inanimate stones be stirred by sincerity? How much more so for those who bear the Five Constants and are endowed with the most refined spirit?\n\nThe lowly and high-stepping steeds are shaped by training; birds of prey are tamed by practice. Though common horses and wild hawks share the same nature, one is adorned and prized while the other remains coarse and base. If one persists in navigating the shallows without ceasing, one will surely merge with the vast sea. If one adds but a single basket of earth without rest, one will surely reach the towering summit.\n\nWhen great rivers surge, dragons and serpents swim in schools; as days pass and months progress, virtue is established and the Dao perfected—then one may rest in the dreams of the sages, and what need has one merely to break free from shackles? Alas, how grievous the plight of the benighted!\n\nIn former times, Zhong You wore a rooster’s crest and a sash adorned with chirping cicadas, brandished his sword, and danced with bared blade, boasting of the strength of Mount Tai’s bamboo, as if to rely on the natural vigor of the unyielding. Yet Confucius, with gentle guidance, infused him with moral instruction, and thus nurtured a disciple who ascended the hall and ranked among the four sages. Zhang Liang, though once a coarse man who gathered ruffians, was gradually steeped in the Dao’s teachings and transformed into a renowned scholar, one who could stand as an equal before kings and nobles. How could he have merely escaped mediocrity?\n\nThus, the wise grieve the fleeting nature of life in the world, lament the swift oblivion of those who vanish without renown, heed the solemn admonition of “morning’s truth,” and yearn to penetrate the unbroken thread of the Dao. They fear the bright warning of impending decline, awaken from the madness of heedless thoughts, and refuse to idle away their days in mere satiation. They do not squander even an inch of time, take the flowing river as a mirror to spur their resolve, and mourn the lightning speed of passing moments. They sever frivolous attachments, reduce worldly trivialities, cleanse their hearts of poverty’s anxieties, and cast off boundless desires. They cease the games of hunting, gambling, and idle play, correct the indolence of daytime naps and listless sitting, and knowing that empty musings yield no benefit, they rouse themselves onto the sagely path.\n\nThey learn to accumulate, inquire to discern, advance virtue and cultivate their work, review the old to grasp the new. Even the sage Duke of Zhou read a hundred chapters daily; Confucius, of heavenly endowment, wore through the thongs of his bamboo scrolls three times. Mo Di, the great worthy, filled carts with his writings; Dong Zhongshu, a man of his age, never glanced beyond his garden gate. Ni Kuan carried his books while weeding with a hoe; Lu Sheng cut reeds to transcribe texts. Huang Ba studied while in shackles; Ning Yue doubled his efforts through night and day. Thus, they delved into the profound mysteries of the Dao, plumbed the depths of subtle words, observed ten thousand ages as if in a single day, and knew the eight wilds as if their own courtyard. They examined the waxing and waning of the Seven Luminaries, traced the transformations of the Three and Five, discerned the signs of rise and decline to come, verified good and ill in past events, and foretold the fortunes of the Yellow and Mysterious as if reading their palms. They discerned incipient signs as if already fulfilled. Thus, their great virtue and towering achievements crowned their age, and their pure fragrance and illustrious renown spread without end.\n\nMoreover, upon hearing the cry of the *shangyang* bird, one prepares for floods; consulting the *niaonu* oracle, one brings order to the east. Inquiring of the floating gourd, one speaks of colors and tastes; questioning the earthen dog, one knows the burial sheep. Through the *Lingbao* scriptures, one understands the forms of mountains and streams; from a broken chopstick, one expounds the *Zhuanche* classic. Gazing at the *libi* constellation, one distinguishes the signs of yin and yang; from the winter locust, one perceives the errors in intercalary months. What mystery is there? It is learning alone.\n\nEven children’s rhymes aid the sage’s ears and eyes—how much more the profound and vast teachings of the ancient texts? Talent and nature vary in excellence; thought and reason differ in depth. Some possess innate knowledge and mature early; others must be led by the ear before they understand. Swiftness is like the feet of the *lü* steed; slow comprehension is like the wings of the quail. Though the former may gallop far and halt abruptly, they do not surpass a single step. Though the latter may advance but a foot at a time, if they persist without ceasing, they may cross mountains and marshes. Is not the distinction between bright and dim learning much the same?\n\nIn youth, the will is single and hard to forget; in age, the spirit scatters and is easily lost. Therefore, one must devote oneself to study early, so that practice becomes as natural as inborn nature.\n\nAs for those of extraordinary talent who, in their prime, encounter misfortune—though they lose the dawn at *Yanggu*, they may yet gather it at *Yuyuan*. One then knows that late sowing in good fields is better than a year of barren waste. The parable of the candle’s light is apt indeed.\n\nIn this troubled age, the teachings of the Ru have declined, and the paths of Wen and Wu are on the verge of collapse. Some drown in sensual pleasures; others race along the paths of rivalry. The poor and solitary who master the Six Arts are suppressed like resources in a drought; those who cling to the wind and attach themselves to phoenix wings, though of mediocre talent, may yet soar to the clouds. Those who abandon fundamentals for trivialities call it diligent cultivation; those who embrace the classics and seek within themselves are deemed obscure and impractical. Thus, all are dust-stained, rain-soaked, frost-crowned, and ice-trodden, clutching their yellowed scrolls and holding fast to purity, yet drawn to the easy paths of crooked ways, hoping for morning sowing and evening harvest.\n\nIf, instead, one lowers the curtain and rests on a high pillow, roams the spirit through the Nine Classics, delves into the subtleties of the arts, savors the profound flavor of the Dao, and dwells in refined seclusion—if one establishes an unshakable resolve, unfurls one’s green banner in the bitter cold, does not measure the world to choose one’s path, and does not drift with the crowd like floating duckweed—how few are such men!\n\nThose who rush anxiously toward advancement and fret over setbacks—how can they abandon the broad and easy thoroughfare to cling to the most difficult and surely impassable road? This is why there are no men by the riverside, why the scholars of *Zijin* lament the customs of the age, why those who grieve for the Dao sigh in sorrow and sink into melancholy.\n\nYet cold and heat alternate, adversity ends in prosperity, and Wen and Wu rise in turn—this is the constant pattern of nature. May the bandit hordes be swept away, the restoration flourish in our time, the Seven Luminaries follow their ancient courses, and the celestial order be renewed! May the great furnace of the Nine Suns turn the great potter’s wheel, the imperial model open the mysterious pattern to guide all things, and the myriad beings be shaped and refined, their finest blossoms cultivated! May the accumulated dust be swept away, evil be transformed into good, weapons be sheathed, and bows cased! May the schools of the *Biyong* be revived, the sons of the state gathered, culture and virtue flourish, golden sounds and jade tones resound, and wind and clouds descend before the dawn! May the travelers from the hills and gardens, the phoenixes with folded wings, soar in the clear void; may the swift steeds with sturdy necks gallop a thousand *li*!\n\nMay those of hidden brilliance, stifled and unrecognized, those of vast learning and deep understanding—men like Shen Gong and Fu Sheng—be summoned with crimson carriages and rush mats, their pent-up energies released, their plain virtues displayed! May they assist the sagely age in reaching the lofty heights of Tang and Yu, and speed along the broad path of grand peace! May the mysterious stream moisten the nine realms, the celestial wind spread beyond all bounds! May the Five Punishments be set aside and songs of praise arise, harmonious qi flourish and fine harvests grow—is this not joyous indeed?",

      "translated_text": "Once, the Second Emperor of Qin held no esteem for the Ru arts, abandoning the Way of the former sages to study the laws of punishment and imprisonment. The people saw no virtue—only the sound of execution. Thus bewildered, they knew not how to turn back; lost, they knew not how to save themselves. They plunged from the heights of the clouds, only to be crushed to powder in the unfathomable depths. From the exalted to the base, can there be no mirror?\n\n**Chapter Four: Exalting Teaching**\nThe *Baopuzi* states: Those who fix their gaze upon autumn’s finest hairs do not perceive the radiance of heaven’s patterns. Those who immerse their hearts in trivial affairs do not grasp the profundity and vastness of the Ru Dao. Dwellers in the stench of salted fish forget the fragrance of orchids; the deeply lost cannot find their way back. Those who receive the guidance of Mo Di possess no crooked or hollowed wood; those who are steeped in the teachings of the Dao produce no perverse or deviant people. No method of cultivation surpasses learning.\n\nThe breadth of learning lies in tirelessness; tirelessness lies in steadfast resolve. If resolve is not steadfast, the poor and lowly will be consumed by the struggle for survival, while the rich and noble will drown in ease and pleasure. Thus, those of far-reaching vision and profound knowledge appear but rarely across the ages, while the ignorant—those who see no farther than a wall—throng shoulder to shoulder.\n\nIf common scholars by day till the soil to feed themselves and by night kindle firewood to pursue their studies; if those in office, in the intervals of feasting and revelry, occasionally turn their gaze to exhortation and admonition—then the world would know no utter fools, and men like Ziyou and Zixia would not be lacking.\n\nYet there are those pressed by hunger and cold, whose coarse fare is insufficient, whose skin is chapped by wind and frost, whose mouths lack even husks and chaff. They have no means to seek a teacher, their families face imminent crisis. If they set aside the plow, the farm lies fallow; if they take up the scroll, their livelihood suffers. Though their learning is incomplete, they may be excused.\n\nThese are like a steed of a thousand *li* trapped beneath a salt cart, or a blade of finest ore never tempered in the forge of Ou Ye. But as for the scions of kings and nobles, who idle in luxury and pleasure, who dance amid silks and brocades, ignorant of the hardships of sowing and reaping—whose eyes grow weary of the profound and whose ears tire of the refined, whose noses are sated with the fragrances of Zheng and Wei—how can they be compared?",

      "translated_text": "Amidst the cloying sweetness of orchid and musk, their palates grow jaded beyond fine meats and rich grains. In winter, they tread in the warmth of sable and fox; in summer, they flutter in the lightness of gauze and silk. They ride forth in carriages grander than Qing Feng’s, and retire to banquet in halls resplendent as Bi Fang’s. Vermilion and kingfisher blue adorn their pillars and beams, while their chests and coffers overflow without end. They array allure and charm to delight the heart, drown themselves in fine wines to sink into drunkenness—becoming champions of gluttony and drink, masters of gambling and games. They neither comprehend literature nor recognize scholars, whom they regard as mere weeds. Their speech and writing lack classical grounding, their arguments tangled in confusion. When pressed in debate, they speak only of warfare; when faced with doubt, they wither before their time. Even if they could distinguish beans from wheat, what difference would it make? They are blind indeed!\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: It is said that the emperor’s eldest heir must enter the Grand Academy, study under a master, and learn the Dao, taking his place among the sons of the state. Only after knowing how to be a minister can one become a ruler; only after knowing how to be a son can one become a father. Thus, learning is established before office, for to govern without learning is like wielding a knife to carve—inevitably causing harm. This is what Zheng Qiao lamented when he spoke of indulging emotions and desires, calling it inhuman.\n\nYet the noble scions are born within the depths of the palace, raised by the hands of women. They have never known the labor of worry or fear. Some are scarcely free of swaddling clothes before being clad in robes of blue and purple; others have barely outgrown their garments before assuming high and illustrious positions. They wield the power of life and death, control promotions and demotions, decide honor and disgrace through their grants and withdrawals, and sway fortune and misfortune with a word. Love and hate shift without pause, while praise and blame assail their ears. Suspicions arise from vague resemblances, where truth and falsehood blur; they seize opportunities to accuse without cause, or fabricate slander from empty trust. The permutations of flattery and deceit are endless, their intricacies beyond the reach of cunning manipulation or the scrutiny of brush and ink.\n\nWithout the arts of learning, how can they discern the true from the false in right and wrong? Moreover, the events of past and present, the principles of self-realization—without these as guides, how can they avoid the disasters of overturned nests and wrecked chariots? The sages of old, though high in station, never forgot the dangers; loving their children, they sought to teach them the proper way. They refined and polished them, guarding against corruption, selecting enlightened teachers to shape their character, and choosing worthy friends to influence them. They urged them to broad reading, showed them success and failure, bade them examine the past to understand the future, observe others to know themselves. They drove them onto the straight path, restrained them within bounds, and instilled awe in their hearts.",

Zhongshan and Dongping found security in their love of antiquity, whereas Yan and Ci, facing walls, courted peril. The past is not forgotten—it serves as a fine mirror for the present.\n\nTang and Wu flourished under the influence of Yi and Lü, while Xin and Gui, swayed by flatterers, fell into ruin. In choosing friends and teachers, one must be especially discerning, selecting those of humble origins and virtuous conduct—men who stand firm in hardship and command respect through their singular resolve. Let their learning be like that of Zhongshu or Huan Rong, their integrity as unyielding as Gong Sui or Wang Ji. Let them discourse day and night on the supreme Way of loyalty and filial piety, clarifying the patterns of survival and ruin, purging defilements, guarding against waywardness, and correcting crookedness. One must suppress personal inclinations, adhere to the law, and enter the teachings of virtue.\n\nIn the late Han and the final years of Wu, matters stood otherwise. Officials were chosen for their carriages and caps, appointed on the basis of partisan praise. Though they bore the name of teachers and friends, they offered no substance—no one to correct oversights. Far from being harmless, they brought harm instead.

The debaucheries of Pu Shang and Bei Li followed one upon another—now wailing, now shouting—turning day into night. They lingered over cups of wine, drowned in the throes of revelry. Some built emerald canopies in lush groves, others shot fierce birds in the wilds or raced swift steeds over treacherous paths. They exposed their retinues to the blazing sun, setting out with torches and returning by starlight. State affairs were neglected, rewards and punishments abandoned.\n\nSome launched ornate boats upon the shimmering waves, cast dense nets in the green rivers, dangled fragrant bait in rippling pools, or unleashed singing cormorants in clear streams to snare fish with sinking lines. They loosed high-flying arrows to bring down light-winged geese, or wove *fufu* nets in the forests, encircled mountains and marshes with layered battues, arrayed crimson pennants among the wind-tossed grasses, and galloped fleet steeds across the plains. They unleashed hounds to tear at cunning beasts, flew swift hawks to seize soaring birds, felled raging rhinos with powerful crossbows, and slew bears and tigers with long spears. Such pursuits, year after year, brought no weariness, continuing without end.\n\nTo this were added the frequent seasonal visits—welcoming and seeing off guests, celebrating and congratulating, exchanging gifts with close associates, and receiving distinguished visitors bearing tokens of esteem. The affairs of the world pressed urgently, bending and exhausting all. Thus did refined propriety drift ever farther away, and indulgent dissipation take deeper root, until the distance from the learning of the Ru grew vast indeed.\n\nHow rare in such an age were those who could perceive the principles of rise and decline, rise above the depths of dissipation, forsake the perilous paths of corrupt virtue, and tread the great Way of enduring order!",

Officials were chosen for their carriages and caps, appointed on the basis of partisan praise.

What they expounded was not the Dao and its virtue; what they recommended was not loyalty and benefit.",

      "translated_text": "Alas! Thus it is that those who preserve the state and secure their families are exceedingly rare, while those who collapse in ruin, weeping blood, are without number.\n\nNow, with sagely brightness reigning above, the ancient ways are examined to succor the world, dikes are strengthened to prevent breaches, and praise and blame are made clear to manifest encouragement and deterrence. One must hope that the imperial clan, the noble houses, and the wealthy and powerful will surely vie to esteem the Ru arts, restrain extravagance in the literary arts, and set aside the ideas of Lao and Zhuang. What is not urgent is the refinement of the Six Classics’ true Way.\n\n**The Way of the Ruler, Fifth Chapter**\nThe *Baopuzi* states: The pure and refined ascends and floats upward; the turbid and yellow sinks and flows downward. Thus are the distinctions of rank and awe established. The sages of old drew from the Two Modes to establish the Way of ruler and minister, and by setting offices and dividing duties, the flourishing of harmonious transformation was achieved. He who would rule others must first cultivate himself to lead the Four Seas, cast aside partiality to equalize the kingly Way, and dispel private attachments to exemplify perfect impartiality. He must model the cosmos to encompass the ten thousand differences. Once truth and falsehood are made clear beyond all things, he must further rely on his own discernment. Once hearing is sharpened by what comes before him, he must further rely on his own perception.\n\nHe must emulate the water-level to advance the good, and the carpenter’s square to dismiss the wicked. He must display virtue and block transgression, employ the near and cherish the worthy, allowing compasses to exhaust their circles and squares to fulfill their angles. He must wield the adze to test its cutting edge, entrusting tasks without measure and employing talents without misallocation. He must examine names and demand realities, frequently inspect and diligently relieve. He must establish canonical teachings to set the people’s ultimate standard, carefully weigh praise and blame to manifest encouragement and deterrence, restrain disorder to prevent usurpation and excess, and scrutinize正直 and crookedness to avert regret and resentment.\n\nIn bestowing, let there be no favoritism in judgment; in deprivation, let there be no concealment by the Hundred Schools. Let the Six Arts be the craftsman’s tools, loyalty and trust the guiding principles, governance the exercise of kindness and harmony, and regulation the application of ritual and punishment. He must elevate the obscure and redress the suppressed, stir the clear currents to purify the turbid, ensuring that things follow no devious paths and affairs adhere to no improper divisions.\n\nThose who stand in court or govern the people must not encroach upon offices or overstep bounds. Those who advance to war must not shrink from danger or evade commands. He must please the near to embrace the distant, cultivate culture to attract the estranged, enrich the people’s wealth and grain, and broaden the paths of advancing virtue. He must block the proliferation of deceit and cunning. When affairs demand it, let punishments be clear and laws strict; when trials are adjudicated, let compassion and reverence prevail. When transformation is pure and governance orderly, let flaws be concealed and faults hidden.\n\nThe Five Teachings lie in magnanimity. Externally, he must gather the many officers in civil and martial arts; internally, he must build the inner bastions of kinship, making close and distant relatives support one another. The tail becomes the body’s trunk, and though branches may flourish, there is no fear of harming the root. Though streams may swell, there is no risk of turning from the source. Like a stone basin or a mountain’s peak, he must firmly check covetous designs. Seeing the collapse of the Three Miao, one knows the springs of rivers cannot be dammed. Witnessing the loss of hidden shadows, one realizes that perilous cliffs cannot be relied upon.\n\nThe Yangtze and Han remain, yet strong foes humiliate the sword’s edge. Armies unite as one, yet Ziyang’s clan is exterminated. The Four Peaks and Three Hills do not belong to a single family. Metal walls and boiling moats are not as secure as human harmony. Guarding lies beyond the seas, not in mountains and rivers. Thus, the worthy ruler, ever fearful of insufficiency, reforms his faults in dread of excess. When plans are deemed sound, he still contemplates danger without respite. Though victorious in war and lands expanded, he remains vigilant against complacency and retires at dusk.\n\nHe models the vast heavens to extend his radiance, emulates the earth’s thickness to broaden his bearing, and wields the sun’s brilliance to illuminate the distant. He relies on spring’s warmth to nurture and autumn’s frost to discipline. He repays counsel to compare similarities and differences, balances scales to weigh the many words, and empties himself to exhaust the sentiments below. He attributes merit to encourage posterity.\n\nGoverned by method, his beginnings and ends may be exhausted. Ordered by measure, disparities may be gauged. Towering like the windswept heights above the sky, none below can estimate his weight. Profound as the abyss with its myriad blades, none nearby can fathom his depth. Thus, the ruler’s source and flow are inexhaustible, and the talents of the hundred officials are fully displayed. My bounds are without limit, and their capacities may be measured.\n\nWhen he issues commands, they resound like thunder’s clap, unaltered by perverse arguments. When he establishes laws and creates systems, they shine like the Seven Luminaries adorning the sky, unbent by love or hate. His grand strategies and far-reaching plans gather like dense clouds high above. Abiding in steadfastness to complete affairs, he stands firm as Mount Song’s roots in the earth. He discerns the hidden and manifest before their signs appear, examines praise and blame from the mouths of cunning speakers, and does not allow simplicity to scatter into artifice or integrity to dissolve into duplicity.\n\nThough capable of independent judgment, he must broadly accept the humble’s advice. Though devoted to refinement, he must purify his ears to the murmurs. When the people suffer cold and hunger, he pities them and blames himself. When the people are at fault, he deems it his own responsibility. When auspicious omens arrive, he credits the gods’ aid. When Heaven’s wrath descends, he reflects on the prayers of the mulberry groves. He does not hesitate to reform what should be changed, nor is he ashamed to retrace his steps when lost.\n\nHe glares like a tiger to warn the secretive, and stands firm as a unicorn to welcome the upright. If no elders sing in the fields, he is ashamed to hear harmonious music. If the people lack grain, he is humbled before sumptuous feasts. Facing the vastness of the heavens, he fears the toil of those who come willingly. Savoring tender delicacies, he worries over the untimely harvest. Hearing the music of pipes and strings, he grieves over excessive pleasure. Gazing upon splendid adornments, he frets over harsh levies.\n\nHe follows Yao’s coarse robes and models Wen of Wei’s plain silks. He recalls the Xia’s humble palaces, recognizes the unbuilt Terrace of Dew, and learns from Zhanghua’s calamity and Epang’s swift ruin. In proclamations and oaths, he remembers the loss of trust in a single moment. In amusement, he perceives Daji’s bewitchment. In campaigns, he measures strength and timing, ensuring no hundred *li* resound with the people’s lament. In executions, he follows human sentiment and reason, ensuring no unjust souls cling to the wine-skin.\n\nHe takes warning from Du Bo’s spectral vengeance and the cries of the wronged. He heeds the great delusion of Duke Xian of Jin in deposing his heir, and the annihilation of Liu Biao’s line in appointing a concubine’s son. In hunting, he rejoices in losing game to gain worthy men, and delights in casting nets to welcome the distant. In favoritism, he fears the slander of Zhao Feiyan and the monopolization of Flying Swallow. In sole reliance, he perceives the perils of the deer and horse. In honoring the upright, he recalls Gaozu’s reception of advice and Jing’s execution of Cuo.\n\nIn indulgence, he guards against Yi Di’s influence. In yielding to flattery, he examines Luan Ying’s removal and the banishment of Zhengzi. He learns from the white dragon to curb recklessness, and observes the emaciated steed to temper insatiability. He prevents the transformation of humans into swine within the six palaces, and halts the pursuit of \"sweating blood\" horses from distant lands. He removes vicious dogs to avoid the disaster of wine-cups, and purchases horse bones to attract swift steeds. He spares the angry frog to encourage bravery, and avoids the mantis to inspire martial valor.\n\nHe listens to Gonglu’s forthright words and embraces Baoshen’s integrity. He plucks the useless hairs from back and belly, and grasps the six pinions for soaring flight. He silences the flattering tongues to heed the admonitions of the *Siyuan*, and prunes the withered and decayed to promote Liang Bo’s beauty. He exiles the seductive Ji to dispel bewitching allure, and retires Zixia to prevent the temptation of the \"leftover peach.\" He conceals the fish in the abyss and wields the handle of the sharp blade. He does not shrink from the trouble of moving firewood to prevent the cost of scorching.\n\nHe fosters the cultivation of integrity and shame, and clarifies the standards of examinations. His anger does not exceed the law to inflict cruelty, nor does his joy transgress statutes to bestow lavish gifts. He severs affection for those he loves when they transgress, granting no pardon. He adopts goodness from those he dislikes when they labor, granting no exemption. He humbles himself to seek loyal counsel and welcomes unwelcome words.\n\nHis decrees are like thunder’s roar, unshaken by sophistry. His laws shine like the stars, unbent by partiality. His strategies gather like clouds, his steadfastness stands firm as mountains. He discerns hidden truths, examines praise and blame, and prevents simplicity from scattering into artifice. Though decisive, he seeks the humble’s advice; though refined, he purifies his ears. He pities the people’s suffering, blames himself for their faults, credits the gods for blessings, and reflects on his errors in calamity. He reforms without hesitation, retraces his steps without shame, warns the secretive, and welcomes the upright.\n\nHe is ashamed by the people’s want, humbled by their toil, and grieves over their excesses. He follows the ancients’ frugality, learns from past calamities, and heeds warnings from history. He executes justly, rewards fairly, and listens to all voices. He governs with method and measure, towering above all, profound beyond fathoming. His rule is inexhaustible, his officials’ talents fully displayed. His commands resound like thunder, his laws shine like stars, his strategies gather like clouds, and his steadfastness stands firm as mountains. He discerns hidden truths, examines praise and blame, and ensures no simplicity is lost to artifice. He governs with wisdom, listens to counsel, and rules with impartiality.",

      "translated_text": "Yet he does not shun broad appeals for counsel, nor reject slanderous words. Though cast down, he does not spurn them; though flaws be minor, he records great merit. He forgets recent wrongs and remembers distant deeds, so that Cao Gui and Meng Ming find renewed purpose, Wei Shang and Zhang Chang achieve vengeance for past shame. The treacherous minister who shot the hook earns merit in restoring order; the captive strategist Li Zuoche offers counsel to halt the spear. Thus, owls and kites transform into mandarin ducks and phoenixes, deceit and falsehood turn to loyalty and steadfastness. Fragrant blossoms flourish in barren salt flats, radiant pearls emerge from mud and mire. Dull blades are sharpened, and all nine virtues harmonize in perfect accord.\n\nFacing west, he hesitates to defer to the talents of teachers and friends, honoring the elderly to foster filial piety and fraternal duty. Thus, those coiled in the depths look up to ascend, and those dwelling in mountains descend to gather. Brilliant and flourishing, they assist within; fierce and mighty, they defend without. Governance is secured above, and the people submit below. Virtue shines near, and its blessings extend afar. The wise exert their strength in their posts, while the common folk yield their disputes in marshes and wetlands.\n\nThereupon, he purges oppressive laws and revives the pure breeze of grand harmony. With carriages of rushes and gifts of jade and silk, he draws forth the hidden talents of hills and gardens. Eminent ministers assemble to deliberate the gains and losses of the Dao. He reduces the ranks of shepherds and those who do not brew fine wine, expands the gates of humility, and blocks the paths of vain competition. He commends the conduct of righteousness and integrity, upholds the standards of the Dao and simplicity, so that those who cleave to virtue rejoice as tender shoots in sweet rain, and those who return are like flowing streams converging in the great river. The people rest as securely as green leaves clinging to sturdy branches, and those with left-folding robes gaze up as stars revolve around the North Star.\n\nThus, the seven celestial bodies do not stray from their course, aligned with the supreme pole. Cold and warmth do not err in their seasons but follow their proper order. The four spirit-beasts appear, auspicious fungi glow, sweet dew drips from the heavens, and bountiful grain sways in full ears. Red drought-demons flee to the divine moat, and plague spirits are bound in distant lands. Rivers do not surge in strange tumult, nor does the Southern Dipper stir the violence of withered grain. Things do not wither in unnatural decay, nor do people utter sighs of lament. Prisons stand empty, the five punishments lie dormant, and the calendar’s renewal reaches where caps and sashes do not, where felt and furs, mountain-dwellers and river-exiles all embrace joy, transform their countenance, and respond to harmony. Distant lands offer rare birds to the vermilion court, jade rings arrive from the westernmost reaches, and round-headed tribes swiftly reform as if mist harmonizing with a strong wind. The remote borderlands obey his commands like an echo answering sound, like a perfect note responding to pure tone.\n\nSuch is the height of flourishing rule, the path trodden by the Three August Ones and Five Emperors.

      "translated_text": "For when roots run deep, branches flourish; when those below rejoice, those above find peace. If a horse is untrained, even Zaofu cannot urge it beyond a thousand *li*; if the people are not attached, even Yao and Shun cannot achieve the beauty of heaven’s harmony. When a horse reaches its limit, unruly behavior arises and collapse follows—this is the sole cause for concern. When the people suffer, rebellion multiplies and disaster inevitably strikes. Should one not tremble with vigilance, awaiting the dawn? Should one not quake with apprehension, ever mindful of peril?\n\nIf a ruler does not clarify his thoughts on order and chaos, nor deeply reflect on the signs of ruin, though his eyes may discern the finest autumn down, his ears distinguish the purest and harshest of the eight sounds, though his literary brilliance cascades like jade from his brush-tip, his martial prowess wields the gleaming blade as if it were an extension of his palm, though his heart retains the recitation of ten thousand texts and his tongue dispenses eloquence like surging waves—all this avails nothing when the earth crumbles beyond salvation, when dissolution is already upon him.\n\nWhy is this so? Because he neglects the great to obsess over the trivial, immerses himself in the affairs of subordinates while remaining blind to the foundational origins. If only he could act with frugality beyond excess, tread as if over deep abysses and thin ice, remain ever wary of reckless haste even in times of safety, and never abandon the fear of ruin even in moments of stability. If he grasps the main cords to order the fine threads, wields the Dao’s principles to govern the multitude, employs the combined strength of Han and Bai to break enemy lines, and exhausts the talents of Xiao and Cao to administer the state; if the armored heart is resolute in its courage and the strategist’s mind collaborates to advance its far-reaching plans—then the ruler, though at ease within his jade chambers, wandering the cloud-topped pavilions, where wine spoils in sweet brews and musicians weary from their dances, may still govern with folded arms, entrusting matters to the worthy, and rest upon his pillow, holding them accountable. Why must he dwell in humble thatched huts, partake of meager fare, endure the toil of guarding the gates, or bear the hardships of a life diminished before he can bring prosperity to the common people and extend the Dao’s harmony beyond the seas?\n\nDeluded rulers, however, act otherwise.

      "translated_text": "Some are benevolent yet indecisive, where vermilion and purple blur in chaos, the upright go unrewarded, and the wicked escape punishment. Others are harsh and cruel, wielding authority without mercy, their punishments excessive and unforgiving, never matching crime to consequence. Their foundations crumble, their roots exposed, yet they perch precariously like nests upon a canopy, comparing themselves to the sun and moon, likening their stature to Mount Tai. They believe that those of towering virtue are easily matched, while the cautious and reverent fall short of their mark.\n\nThus, the innocent suffer unjust punishments, and the people see no virtue—only the specter of execution. Officials deem the compliant as worthy, promoting those who curry favor while sidelining the capable. The court fills with the mother’s kin, who monopolize power, while decisions rest in the hands of flatterers. Those of distant lineage or merit are overlooked, their talents disregarded, while the trusted are petty sycophants. The forthright are suppressed, their voices drowned in the chorus of conformity, while the favored rise on empty praise, their achievements unexamined. Those entrusted with governance and defense—some corrupt their posts, others sow discord in the court, some falter in weakness, and others, timid and craven, squander military advantage. Yet the ruler, blind to their failings, refuses to demote or dismiss them, instead clinging to hope for their redemption. Small vessels tasked with great burdens inevitably court disaster. Meanwhile, the truly capable—those of broad vision and unsupported merit—languish in obscurity, some clad in coarse robes at court, others sunk in poverty, their Way confined, their strength untapped. Such is the root of decline and ruin.\n\nMoreover, they ignore the classics and their warnings, neglecting study to indulge in revelry. They build towering pavilions while neglecting the Dao, expand parks and gardens while narrowing benevolence, deepen moats and ponds while shallowing trust and faith. They delight in hounds and horses yet despise forthright counsel, prize jewels and jade while scorning wisdom and strategy, adorn themselves in fine silks while skimping on relief for the poor, delay aid while hastening to amass wealth, obsess over the hunt while neglecting the harvest, exalt the wealthy while devaluing lives. They elevate entertainers and dismiss scholars, lavish favor on courtiers while slighting warriors, drown in sensual pleasures while ignoring state affairs, prioritize drunken revelry over judgment, impose harsh labor while withholding rewards, and squander resources on frivolous crafts, hoarding delicacies while the people starve. In such a state, ruin cannot be blamed on Heaven, nor weakness attributed to others.\n\nFortune and misfortune lie within oneself—were Tang and Wu exceptions? Of old, King Wen of Zhou buried the unburied bones, and the world praised his benevolence; King Zhou of Yin carved out Bi Gan’s heart, and the seas reviled his cruelty. The gaze of all rests upon the ruler—praise or blame, success or failure—hinges not on quantity but on weight. When praise is abundant, even distant tribes embrace virtue, yet it cannot be feigned. When blame accumulates, the heart of the realm fractures, and no words can mend it. Thus, small virtues, though of little immediate benefit, must not be neglected, and minor vices, though seemingly harmless, must not be indulged.\n\nThose who indulge their desires without sharing joy with the people find no solace in their sorrows. Those who erode their foundations and heighten their perch fail to see the collapse beneath them, and none remain to prop them up. Then, reins slip from their grasp, divine artifacts are seized and never returned, strength is exhausted, wealth depleted, and the people can bear no more. Resentment festers below, Heaven’s wrath gathers above. Fields become bandits, and within the tent, Qi and Qi plot; Ji Chang seizes Yin from the west, while Chen and Wu rise with swords drawn. Liu and Xiang brandish spears, their fury like a gale. Scaling ladders breach the hundred-zhang walls, blades clash beneath the palace gates, and flaming arrows rain upon the inner palace. The outer defenses crumble, and only then do they lament, seeking distant sages, sweeping the path to welcome recluses, yearning for Yi and Lü from the mountains, summoning Sun and Wu from the wilds. They beg for wise counsel yet heed none, seek grand strategies yet ask no questions—like pouring water from the sea to douse a burning mansion, or crafting a boat after the flood has swept away the home.\n\nThe lofty title of \"majestic\" cannot be claimed through arrogance and stinginess, nor can the seal of Mount Tai’s enfeoffment be secured through wanton desire. Even the sagest of rulers, spurring their chariots to the limit, feared falling short of the past—yet mediocre sovereigns, ambling at a leisurely pace, believe themselves superior. Some, in safety, contemplate peril; others, in peril, indulge in ease. Some, having achieved order, remain vigilant and unyielding; others, teetering on the edge like a string of eggs, remain oblivious, unaware. Without the downfall of tyrants like Xin and Gui, how could the value of reverence and wisdom be so keenly felt? Let this be ever in mind—oh, ever in mind!",

Thus, the imperial enterprise flourished, all affairs coalesced, the Four Gates stood solemn, the Hundred Offices proceeded in harmony, and the barbarians posed no threat to the Central Kingdom. The Phoenix nested in the Aligned Chambers—\n\nThis may be likened to the head and the limbs: though there exists a distinction of honor and humility, in truth, they rely upon one another as one body. The ruler must measure ability before bestowing office, lest the overturned tripod’s ruin ensue. The minister must weigh his talents before accepting, that he may avoid the calamity of exile.\n\nThose who, like shadow and echo, bow and obey every command are but hollow vessels of idleness. Those who defy orders, confront authority, and steadfastly reject self-interest are the pillars that secure the throne. Those who anticipate desires and flatter are the sycophants. Those who correct errors and rectify deviations are the state’s unyielding backbone.\n\nIf one must prostrate before the executioner’s block to offer forthright remonstrance, or cling to the cauldron’s edge to speak truth—when loyalty is met with suspicion and slander prevails—then exile may be endured. If one’s death would serve no purpose but to compound the ruler’s faults, then departure is permissible.\n\nIn all actions, if they are not grounded in the canonical teachings, they must not be undertaken.",

      "translated_text": "When at rest, they do not follow established norms without cause. Petitions and solicitations find no place; personal barriers are never breached for private ends. Punishments are administered with clarity, never indiscriminately. What grieves them is that rewards are not bestowed upon those who curry favor, that they do not usurp authority to amass power, that they do not tolerate corruption while feigning purity. In office, they strive to speak fully to correct errors; in retirement, they ponder how to recommend the worthy without obstruction. Rising early and retiring late, they are anxious that the people’s affairs are not at peace. Their personal conduct is frugal, their aspirations restrained, as though guarding against treading on thin ice. They accept counsel and present scholars, yet never boast of it; they do not dwell on gains that are not righteous. In their hearts, when standing in court, they hold fast to the integrity of an arrow’s shaft; in private, they take the completion of good deeds as their standard. When facing peril or encountering difficulty, they abandon their families without hesitation. When wielding the scales of justice, they weigh with impartiality, making no distinction between near and far. They emulate the directives of Xiao He and Cao Shen, admire the extraordinary strategies of Zhang Liang and Chen Ping, pursue the loyal devotion of Zhou Bo, model themselves on the uprightness of the two Bao, uphold the frugality and integrity of Yuan Ang, and maintain the steadfast resolve of Tian Fen. In the end, they willingly accept the fate of Yao Li, who burned his body, while guarding against the disaster of Han Xin and Ying Bu, who lost their loyalty.\n\nThey do not shirk labor when sent forth, nor do they boast of merit upon return. They ascribe achievements to others, take blame upon themselves, and yield precedence to those below. Their sincerity is reverent and trembling, ever as though the awe of Heaven’s majesty were before their faces. Day and night, they remain vigilant, as though a seething cauldron stood at their side. When burdened with great trust, they take Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou as their models; when exerting themselves in the four directions, they follow the examples of Ji Dan and Shao Hu. In sending off the departed and attending to the living, they exhaust their loyalty without wavering. When seizing traitors who violate the law, they are as fierce as hawks and falcons preying on sparrows. In defending the frontiers, they emulate the lofty footsteps of Wei Jiang and Li Mu. In governing the people, they aspire to the virtuous transformations of Wen Weng and Ren Chen.\n\nThose who are utterly loyal do not use their state for personal gain—how much less would they employ their wisdom to mislead their ruler? Those who are steadfast in righteousness do not fear the destruction of their ancestral temples—how much less would they shrink from demotion or disgrace? Thus, they are able to preserve their meritorious honor, ennoble their kin, and entrust their legacy to posterity. As the odes of the people resound and the ritual vessels of Kunwu endure, the capable inscribe their achievements. What men were Hou Ji and Gao Yao, if not such as these?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: If a minister’s merit is not substantial, he feels shame at the emptiness of his generous salary. If his achievements are not flourishing, he is humiliated by the undeserved height of his rank. Walking in trust and contemplating compliance, he aids both Heaven and man. Fearing excess and dwelling in humility, he ensures lasting fortune. Every step adheres to the rules; every raised hand follows the marking line. Though honors may be delayed, disgrace and regret will surely be far off.\n\nIf, however, one harms the ruler to curry favor with subordinates, abandons the public good to pursue private ends, flatters and obeys to add water to water—even when the ruler’s actions are flawed, he smiles and praises them, repeatedly offering trinkets to lead the ruler into wrongdoing—using clever words to undermine governance, his countenance seeking to please, he obscures the ruler’s clarity below and blocks the path of worthy men’s advancement. Externally, he forms alliances with foreign powers; internally, he cultivates factions that betray the public. Though his talent may suffice to gloss over wrongs, his words to embellish faults, and his authority to rival that of Zhao Gao in dominating the court or Dong Zhuo in his unchecked power—there has never been one who did not end with his body steeped in the executioner’s blade and his family consumed by fire.\n\nYet the foolish and blind abandon the correct to follow the crooked, forsake the true to consort with the false. Though ruin looms, they do not alter their course. The calamities that befall them do not descend from Heaven.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: A minister is like the limbs to the body—when treading on ice or grasping thorns, he cannot refuse. Thus, the ancients compared him to the earth: dig into it, and springs of water emerge; plant in it, and a hundred grains flourish. The living stand upon it; the dead enter it. Though his merits are many, he does not expect reward; though his toils are great, he does not dare complain. Clearly understanding this principle is the key to preserving oneself.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: A minister’s duties are manageable when his responsibilities are limited, but when his charge is vast, much will be neglected. Without the strength of Meng Ben and Xia Yu, one cannot shoulder the weight of multiple men; without the exceptional ability of ten thousand, one cannot oversee unique and complex situations. This is why Han Xin was punished for overstepping his authority and Ziyuan feared the disaster of being unequal to his task.\n\nIf, however, one’s talents are unparalleled, both civil and martial virtues perfectly balanced, possessing within the lofty calculations of a trusted advisor and without the far-reaching strategies of a master diplomat—though affairs may be numerous, all will be accomplished; though paths may diverge, both will be traversed. To abandon such a one is to disrupt the proper order; to entrust him is to find no equal. In such cases, one may take on multiple roles. For those not of this caliber, they should reflect carefully: if a weak cart bears a heavy load, how rarely does it reach its destination!\n\nOrdinary men, when rewarded with honor, do not consider the later perils. Once they are drowned in disaster, it extends to their ruler and kin—is this not lamentable? All decline the axe and adze, yet when in high office, none yield their positions, even when unfit for the duties. Alas! This is why Chen Ping and Li Yiji issued warnings about insufficient strength, and Zhang Liang loftily withdrew to practice restraint.\n\n**Good Governance, Seventh Chapter**\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: Birds that flock together without choosing their trees will surely be those whose nests are abandoned. Those who enter service without assessing the times will surely be men who face danger and disgrace. When the times are favorable, they soar like dragons riding the clouds; when the times are lost, they drift like great fish stranded on high ground. Thus, the wise conceal their talents and await their moment, biding their time to act.\n\nIf lofty crags are about to collapse, thin threads cannot hold them; if the Dragon Gate boils over, a handful of earth cannot dam it. Therefore, they do not recklessly seek profit or gamble on luck.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: The Duke of Zhou’s regency, Yi Yin’s demotion of Tai Jia, Huo Guang’s deposition of the Prince of Changyi, and Sun Lin’s removal of the young emperor—these are called setting aside the Dao to employ expediency for the sake of stabilizing the state. Yet the Duke of Zhou was exiled, with slanderous rumors filling the roads; Yi Yin ultimately faced execution, and a great fog lasted three days; Huo Guang nearly brought ruin upon himself, and his family was soon destroyed; Sun Lin’s head and feet were separated before the mulberry trees he planted had time to change. Their cries of laughter had not yet faded when their wails of sorrow began.\n\n\"If, when in peril, one does not support, of what use is that minister?\" Seven upright ministers could not save a ruler without Dao, allowing villains like Wang Mang to arise, using old precedents to embellish their wrongs while harboring the hearts of wolves and jackals. The foundation of disorder was laid by Yi Yin and Huo Guang. Future gentlemen should take deep heed of this.\n\nThe matter of deposing and installing rulers is a minor compliance with the great reversal—it cannot be prolonged. The deceit of Zhao Wang was already met with censure; how much less can one depose a ruler and expect it to be acceptable? Such men all calculated their actions and, once successful, gradually faced calamity. Yet those whose schemes began in secrecy, who were betrayed by greedy men, whose clans were exterminated and ancestral temples destroyed, while others were enfeoffed—such cases are not few.\n\nIf there are treacherous ministers aiding and abetting tyranny, like Jie’s Gan Xin, Zhou’s Chong Hou and E Lai, or Li’s faction—would it not be easy to replace them with the loyal and good? Remove the many evils at the ruler’s side, banish the corrupt to the four frontiers, hold the borders with arms, uphold the straight Dao, guard the law, maintain strict discipline, wield the axe with righteousness, stand with solemn dignity, reward with certainty, punish without exception, allow no transgressions, appoint the worthy, employ the capable, associate only with the loyal, never act without authorization, proceed only after petitioning, correct the ruler’s errors with reason when he strays, and tremble with reverence, never forgetting respect. Thus, the state will be eternally secure above, and one’s own person will be free from harm below. When the task is accomplished, do not remain; resign and retire. Select the loyal and capable to take one’s place—is this not more than sufficient?",

      "translated_text": "Why must one seize the sovereign’s seals and endanger the lord one professes to serve? The ruler is as Heaven, as a father—if the ruler may be deposed, then Heaven too may be altered, and a father too may be replaced. Those whose merit overshadows the age go unrewarded; those whose might overawes their lord court peril. Such men, though peerless in victory and conquest, in meritorious toil, are like the bow cast aside once the birds are slain, the hound boiled once the hares are caught. How much more so when one deposes one’s lord and yet expects the successor to cherish him? Is this not akin to a son who abandons the mother who bore him, casts her into the mountain valleys, takes another to raise him, and then boasts, “I am as filial as Boyu or Zeng Shen—only my parent was unfit for service, so I discarded her”? Though others may feast him with triply sacrificial meats, attend him at dusk and dawn, how can they truly hold him dear? Even if he is trusted, men like Huo Guang, though showered with ranks, titles, and boundless rewards, were exalted only by stratagem—was this their true devotion?\n\nTo cast off a wife and slander her former husband, to buy a slave and revile his former master—even common men find such acts unjust. Why? Because they deeply wound the bonds of natural affection. Thus, Yue Yang was shunned for his ruthlessness, and Qin Xi was favored for his excessive indulgence. Yet世人 deem Tang and Wu righteous and Yi Yin and Huo Guang worthy—this only encourages treason. Moreover, deposed rulers are not always wholly at fault: some, while aiding young lords, abuse their power and accumulate great sins, plotting future harm. When their influence still holds, others replace them to avert immediate disaster, securing their own advantage under the guise of stabilizing the realm. Once authority is seized and life-and-death decisions are made, the deposed lord’s divine mandate is lost, and all sins of the lower ranks are laid at his door. Though some may see this, who dares speak openly? Without a Dong Mou or Zhu Xu to devise a plan, without a Nan Shi or Dong Hu to record the crime, who in later days will set the record straight? Only the discerning will realize that the wickedness of Jie and Zhou was not so great, nor the virtue of Tang and Wu so splendid.\n\nThe canons all exalt the ruler and humble the minister, strengthen the trunk and weaken the branches. The *Spring and Autumn*’s principle holds that Heaven cannot be opposed. The sages’ scriptures teach that serving father and lord is as one, and the people’s lives rest on these three bonds, equally upheld. To permit the deposition of rulers is to open the gate to unrighteousness, to let the low overstep the high—how can this serve as instruction? Vulgar scholars, mired in sophistry, debate whether Tang and Wu were like those who ate horse liver to condemn such acts, failing to grasp that adaptability in change is more precious than rigid adherence to goodness, that one may act against the norm without rebelling against principle.\n\nYet earlier writers did not refute such deeds with the great Dao, allowing those of such intent to sharpen their blades and ascend crumbling peaks—this is no way to prolong life, secure the age, or avert danger. Though their fame may briefly flourish and their rewards swiftly gather, it is no different from the sacrificial ox adorned in embroidery, the deep-sea fish coveting buckwheat, the parched man drinking from the clouds, or the starving man gorging on rancid meat. Those who wield the brush all praise such acts as fine tales, turning unpardonable crimes into wisdom in change, leaving men to sigh in endless lament.\n\nIf some admonish me that this harms the sages and will surely bring censure, I reply: Shun and Yu were tested within and without before receiving the mandate at Wen Zu’s shrine. Even if one wished to harm the sages, how could they be harmed? Once, Yan Yannian impeached Huo Guang for unrighteousness, and the court fell silent, unable to refute him. How much less should I fear, when my words serve as a warning to the age and name no one in particular? As the saying goes...",

But to demand that one’s words be heeded and one’s person be secure—this must await a time when the times are not adverse. For those who scheme and obstruct, even the bandit Zhi could not surpass them. They exalt the powerful and suppress the lowly, detest the upright and revile the just, dreading the censure of the impartial and fearing the exposure of their crookedness. Thus, they strive to eliminate those who surpass them to avert their own punishment. Enlightened rulers do not appear in every generation, and mediocre sovereigns confuse black and white. Unable to accept and employ loyal counsel, they may even leak the most earnest admonitions. Thereupon, flatterers like Hong Gong and Shi Xian adorn their cunning words to fabricate semblances of virtue, feigning public spirit to advance their private schemes. Now, those who offer arts of longevity are met with the penalty of immediate execution, and those who propose plans to secure the throne swiftly incur the calamity of endangering their own lives. Thus it is said: It is not the speaking that is difficult—it is the timing of speech that is hard.\n\nEven when the worthy advise the sagely, they may not be immediately accepted. Thus, Yi Yin petitioned Tang seventy times. When the wise counsel the foolish, their words will surely not be received. Thus, King Wen’s remonstrance of Zhou was ultimately rejected. That one’s words are not believed may still be tolerable.

      "translated_text": "A vessel small cannot contain a thing large; thus, a child may cast aside a thousand pieces of gold to chase a butterfly, and the people of Yue may spurn the eight delicacies to relish frogs and toads. What they prize is not truly precious, and what ails them is their failure to recognize what is essential. For if a thing is not put to use, though rare, it is not valued; if none partake of it, those who would harm it will surely come.\n\nOf old, Duke Ling of Wei heard sagely words yet startled repeatedly; Duke Xiao of Qin listened to lofty discourse yet fell into fearful slumber. To seek the achievements of grand governance and the merits of able ministers while retreating in their pursuit is like racing backward to chase the swift—setting out for Chu yet heading toward Yan.\n\n**On the Pursuit of Rectitude (10)**\n*Baopuzi* states: The Southern Sea draws the tributaries to form its unfathomable depths; the Celestial Gardens pile wood and stone to reach the utmost heights of heaven. A towering edifice pierces the clouds by the accumulation of many beams; a wheel’s curve and a yoke’s straightness leave no part wanting. Thus, when the sagely ministers of the *Yuankai* assisted [King Wen], their transforming virtue reached heaven; when those of pacifying might were complete, the treacherous schemers of the hunt lay dormant. This is how Shun and Yu came to possess the realm without contention, and why Duke Ling of Wei, though arrogant and self-indulgent, did not perish.\n\nWhen many strengths combine, even ten thousand *jun* are not too heavy to lift; when the wisdom of the multitude is employed, even myriad tasks are not too burdensome to bring to order. Thus, the centipede dies yet does not topple, and the state with many scholars falters yet does not fall. Yet a dam’s stitching cannot mend seams, nor can an awl’s drill sever; oxen and horses cannot guard the gate, nor can chickens and dogs pull the carriage. Employ each in its strength, and no task will fail; avoid their shortcomings, and the world will waste no talent.\n\n**On Honoring the Worthy (11)**\n*Baopuzi* states: One who abandons a light boat to cross boundless waters does not see certain passage; one who seeks grand governance without worthy assistance has never heard of success. The great roc’s ascent through the void relies on the strength of its six pinions; the deep-dwelling dragon’s flight to heaven depends on the clouds’ companionship. Thus, summoning the worthy and employing resources are the sovereign’s essential duties; establishing merit and accomplishing deeds are the thoughts of the eminent and talented.\n\nTo delight in order and stability yet neglect the wise is no different from desiring a distant journey while casting aside the *qiji* steed. To lift the obscure from their rustic seclusion, to raise the overlooked from their hidden depths, to assign them tasks commensurate with their talents, and to reward them with emoluments befitting their merits—this is how a lord treats the worthy. To toil day and night in public service, to exhaust heart and strength in the hundred offices, to advance the good and expel the wicked, and to leave no knowledge unapplied—this is how a minister repays his patron.\n\nThe world may have reclusive worthies, but no lord stands alone; scholars may delight in retreat without worry, but a ruler cannot bring order without ministers. Thus, Fu Yue and Lü Shang did not eagerly seek recognition, for their virtue was complete and they held kings and dukes in light esteem. Yet Kings Tang and Wen of Zhou dreamed of them—obtaining the worthy is how great merit is built, for it requires able assistance.\n\nThe peril of life arises within the depths of the palace, and one grows up in...",

      "translated_text": "The hands of palace women know nothing of the hardships of sowing and reaping, nor do they understand the principles of anxiety and fear. Entrusted with the household and the succession of the ancestral line, they are blind to the rise and fall of the state. Their urgent concern lies in extravagance and waste, their chief pursuit in hunting and feasting, drowning in revelry and music. Hearing lewd sounds, they startle to listen; seeing alluring sights, they shift their gaze. Their ears and eyes are enslaved to these two things alone, their judgment of people clouded, their spirits untrained in the classics. They know only play and amusement to please their hearts and minds, unaware that extraordinary men can secure the altars of state. Rhinoceros horns, elephant tusks, pearls, and jade—though worthless—arrive from ten thousand *li* away, while vessels that could steady a tottering realm, though capable of action, sink into oblivion within the four borders. The twin scourges of illness have already taken hold, yet they seek good physicians; the disaster of a sagging roofbeam has already gathered, yet they ponder schemes—how is this different from digging a well when fire breaks out or surveying fields when hunger strikes?\n\nEven the mediocre and dull cannot be left untended and expected to exhaust their strength—how much less can one hope for sudden usefulness from those without prior cultivation?\n\n**XVI. Employing the Capable**\n\nSome say: \"A tail larger than the body cannot be wagged; a minister more worthy than his lord cannot be employed.\" Thus, forcing down what the mouth cannot contain will surely choke, and entrusting power to one whose talent is unmatched will invite contempt.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* says: How perverse is this claim! In ancient times, Jingzi assumed the reins of state as a mere boy, and the kingdom was saved—thanks to the twenty-five elders who gathered around him. Zijian of Jian rose from commoner status to govern a great commandery, his success due to the many men greater than himself who brought their aid. Duke Huan of Qi killed his brother to seize the throne, his conduct like that of birds and beasts—yet when he unbound his hair, poured libations, and entrusted all affairs to the Master of the Left, he became the first of the hegemons. After Guan Zhong’s death, however, disasters arose in quick succession. When Lu employed Jizi, for over twenty years there were no flawed policies at home and no encroachments abroad; the people, though perishing, suffered no famine or plague—was this not because his talent fell short of his achievements? Yet when he took charge himself, the calamities were as described.\n\nEmperor Gao of Han decided defenses within the palace curtains and determined victory a thousand *li* away—yet he was not the equal of Zhang Liang and Chen Ping. He trained troops in great numbers and grew ever stronger, yet in battle he was no match for Han Xin and Ying Bu. Only by employing them all together did he complete the imperial enterprise. Thus, swift steps and weary marches are not as good as riding a carriage; chasing and pursuing are not as good as borrowing the skills of others. Strong crossbows, though hard to draw, can shatter the sturdy and reach the distant; great ships, though hard to board, can carry heavy loads and cross deep waters. Fierce generals, though hard to control, can break enemy offensives and expand the borders; lofty worthies, though hard to approach, can put the constant norms in order.\n\nIn the past, Duke Ai of Lu was a mediocre ruler, yet Confucius, the supreme sage, did not dare but devote himself wholly to his service. Duke Jing of Qi was of limited ability, yet Yan Ying, a man of great worth, did not dare but offer his utmost sincerity. How could a minister presume to compare his wisdom and strength, his strategic vision and capacity, with those of his lord? Must one wait for a Yao or Shun before serving? What task is not the lord’s? What command is not the people’s? To feel shame that one’s lord does not measure up to Tang and Yu—this is the mindset of the enlightened.\n\n**XVII. Honoring the Worthy**\n\nThe *Baopuzi* says: When You Yu was among the Rong, Duke Mu of Qin was filled with worry; when Dechen was killed, Duke Wen of Jin rejoiced. When Yue Yi departed, Yan fell into ruin; when Fan Li and Wen Zhong entered, Yue became a hegemon. These were men who could break states and destroy families—how could their presence alone be so weighty and their absence so light?\n\nThe tomb of Liu Xiahui still blunted the edge of the Xiongnu’s might—how much more would his presence in the court? The reclusion of Ganku still repelled the attacks of a neighboring state—how much more if he were placed at the right hand of the throne? The mere likeness of Zhi Du made fierce enemies tremble; the corpse of Zhuge Liang still made great states hesitate to act. With such men to repel invaders, the land would surely not be encroached upon; with such men to lead the army, the lord would surely not be humiliated.\n\nThus, the enlightened lord distributes silken gifts in humble alleys, raises the forgotten feathers in withered groves, and sends carriages flying across river bridges. He opens the four gates without tiring, spares no gold or jade, travels a thousand *li* without reluctance, humbles himself without shame, and lowers his words without disgrace—all to make the pursuit of worthies his foremost duty and the acquisition of men of talent his greatest treasure. Those who recommend them receive the highest rewards; those who obstruct them are deemed usurpers of office.\n\nThus, the Duke of Zhou presented his gift in a thatched cottage; the Lord of Shao bowed to Chang Hong in the marketplace. When Master Zou crossed the border, the Lord of Yan swept the path before him; when Zhuangzi had not yet eaten, the Lord of Zhao stood in attendance. Duke Wen of Jin received Hai Tang, yet sat with lowered mats and dared not straighten his posture; the Marquis of Qi visited Jiqiu, though weary from frequent visits, and did not shirk the labor. King Ding received a whipping from Bao Shen; Duke Jian removed his armor before Gong Lu. Though they lowered their lofty status and suppressed their pride to honor the lowly, in the end they only sharpened their vision and extended their sight, lent their ears to broaden their hearing. Like dragons soaring and tigers crouching, it was only fitting.\n\n**XVIII. On Punishment**",

      "translated_text": "Bao Puzi says: None do not esteem benevolence, yet none can govern purely by benevolence. None do not despise punishment, yet none can order the people without it. All say that a sagely ruler governs the age, and customs turn as grass bends before the wind; the Dao spreads and transformation ripens, so that peace prevails—yet when punishment is used, I must discuss it thus:\n\nVirtue and instruction are the sacrificial robes of embroidered splendor; punishment and penalties are the armor and helmet that ward off blades. If one were to govern the cunning and violent with virtue and instruction, it would be like facing sharpened halberds in ceremonial vestments. To apply punishment and penalties in a well-ordered age would be like ascending the ancestral temple clad in armor. Thus, benevolence is the instrument for nurturing all things, while punishment is the tool for correcting wrongs. I wish to benefit them, yet they seek to harm; if benevolence fails to reform them, only punishment can halt their transgressions. Punishment serves as the assistant to benevolence—this much is clear.\n\nConsider those who cultivate embryonic breathing, regulate their breath, exhale and inhale, absorb the radiance of the sun, turn their gaze inward, and practice the bear’s climb and the bird’s stretch—these are the arts of long life. Yet they are arduous and slow; few who attempt them succeed, and one in ten thousand may attain mastery. When illness is grave, pain severe, the body weakened, and life in peril, one cannot but attack it with iron and stone, treat it with potent medicines. If one were to abandon the remedies of Bian Que and instead aspire to the Way of Master Red Pine and Wang Qiao, the dead would be legion.\n\nBenevolence in governance is not without its beauty, yet the common people, crafty and deceitful, pursue profit and forget righteousness. If one does not align them with awe, correct them with punishment, and yearn from afar for the customs of Fuxi and Shennong, chaos will become irreparable. Its calamity will be profound, and using killing to halt killing—is this a matter of delight? The creation of the Eight Trigrams exhausts principle and fulfills nature, making clear the use of punishment and imprisonment, as seen in *Shi Ke* bound with ropes and fetters, and in *Xi Kan*, where peril is habituated. Thus, the use of punishment is ancient indeed.\n\nEven in the time of the Yellow Emperor, whose sagely virtue was lofty, he personally led expeditions, fought a hundred battles, left corpses strewn at Zhuolu, and blood flowing at Banquan—yet he could not ensure that his age knew no rebellion. Even when he sheathed his weapons, how could he make all the people good, never commit crimes, and govern themselves? In the flourishing age of Yao and Shun, which mirrored Heaven, punishment was still used: banishment, execution, exile, and exile afar—only then did the world submit. Emperor Wen of Han, whose silence was profound, rivaled the heights of Cheng and Kang—yet he still executed four hundred men, and many died under the lash.\n\nJust as the master carpenter does not abandon the plumb line, so that no wood remains crooked, the enlightened ruler does not abolish execution and punishment, and thus no governance decays into ruin. The Way of Heaven and Earth cannot be purely benevolent: the Azure Yang unfolds the harmony of nurturing and ripening, while the White Autumn enforces the severity of withering and killing. When the melting wind fans, the withered and emaciated revive; when white dew congeals, the luxuriant blossoms wither and fall. Thus, the myriad things flourish, and the year’s work is accomplished. If warmth knew no cold, creeping things would not hibernate, and roots and plants would bloom in winter. If leniency knew no severity, villainy would arise, and sharp weapons would be ever at hand.\n\nTherefore, the enlightened ruler employs clear rewards to uphold the upright and certain punishment to eliminate the perverse. The instruments of encouragement and deterrence are none more essential. To encourage the people, one establishes instruction, balancing leniency and severity so that the timid are not bullied and the resolute do not harm kindness. The crimes subject to the Five Punishments number three thousand—this is to ensure that defenses are not bent. When the Minister of Justice carries out punishment, the ruler does not raise his hand—this is to ensure that the law is not abolished. If defenses are bent, treachery sprouts; if the law is abolished, calamity and chaos multiply.\n\nA ruined state is not without decrees; the trouble lies in their profusion and lack of enforcement. A defeated army is not without prohibitions; the trouble lies in their establishment and lack of observance. Thus, myriad evils spread unchecked, and inferiors grow insolent toward their superiors. Rewards are valued for matching merit, not for their weight; punishments are valued for fitting the crime, not for their cruelty.\n\nIf the whip and rod are abandoned in the household, servants grow lazy; if military campaigns cease in the state, subordinates grow remiss. Affection must await respect, or it will surely fail. Thus, rites are established to exalt virtue, and punishment is created to enforce awe. For virtue requires the support of awe to endure. If Ban Chu were to discard the compass and square, no object would be true to its form; if the enlightened ruler were to release the reins of law, deceit and cunning would run rampant.\n\nThough Yao and Shun’s benevolence was like Heaven, they did not pardon the Four Crimes. Though the Duke of Zhou was kind to his brothers, he did not spare the Two Uncles. Confucius executed Zheng Mao; Emperor Wu of Han killed his nephew—both shed tears, yet the law left them no choice. Thus, executing one to shake ten thousand, sacrificing the few to accomplish the many: like combing tangled hair, the benefit is widespread; like excising an abscess, the preservation is great. Therefore, cauterization and acupuncture, though painful, cannot be halted, for they cure illness. Punishment and law, though they prevent ugliness, cannot be abolished, for they save the state.\n\nAn army of six legions is not necessarily all brave; charging into battle and plunging into fire are things men dread. Yet if one urges them with a serene countenance, few will risk their lives; if one drives them with decapitation, none will fail to fight fiercely. Thus, those who serve with laughter do not match the speed of those who advance at a shout; those who are lured with kindness do not equal the order of those driven by execution. Therefore, though one may be at ease in the deep valley, the law must be strict; though Wei Zi was swift to discard ashes, his punishments were severe. For to use what they fear to restrain what they trifle with is the art of preserving the people whole.\n\nThe art of discerning illness lies in preventing disease before it arises; the essence of governing chaos lies in averting calamity before it comes. If one were to use light punishments to forbid grave crimes, or employ lenient laws to guard great profit, setting them forth in ever-greater detail—yet offenders would only multiply. This is like digging a pit to block the road: not the method of a humane ruler.\n\nThe good governor must first rectify himself to lead others, govern the near to order the distant, and not bend the law to follow his inclinations. He must punish the guilty without pardon—like Shi Que, who sacrificed love to destroy his kin, or Duke Wen of Jin, who suppressed his feelings to execute Jie Zitui. Thus, benevolence is the adornment of governance, while punishment is the bridle and reins of ruling the age. Adornment is not the most urgent thing for the body, yet bridle and reins cannot be absent for even a moment.\n\nIf solemn reverence slackens even slightly, indolence and insolence arise; if majestic severity relaxes for a moment, the multitude of evils takes heart. To fail to anger when anger is due is to make a tiger of a treacherous minister; to fail to kill when killing is due is to unleash a great bandit. Water, long eroding the river and mountains, begins with a handbreadth; a towering tree of a thousand spans starts with a hair’s breadth. A fire kindled by drilling wood can be extinguished with a ladle of water; an unhatched swan’s egg can be crushed in the palm. Yet when it rides the whirlwind and stirs the vast wilds, or beats its six wings to soar into the morning clouds, even the wise and brave cannot control it.\n\nThus, the enlightened ruler governs difficulty while it is easy, eliminates evil while it is still small. He does not boast of his goodness to foster disorder, nor wield the axe with hesitation. Punishment, then, is the sacred instrument of the state, to be wielded by the ruler alone—it cannot be entrusted to others, just as a long sword cannot be grasped by the blade, or a giant fish cannot be drawn from the deep.\n\nThis is the origin of rise and decline, the source of safety and peril. Tian Chang’s usurpation of Qi, the Six Ministers’ partition of Jin, Zhao Gao’s assassination of the Qin emperor, Wang Mang’s seizure of the Han—these all began with the gradual accumulation of frost before the ice hardens.",

      "translated_text": "Some sigh forever by the seashore, others clutch their hearts at Wangyi Palace—calamities that spread to ancestral temples serve as warnings to those yet to come. This arises from admiring empty fame in bygone ages while forgetting the real disasters at hand.\n\nSome argue: \"The rise of penal laws belongs to degenerate times. The Way of establishing people lies only in benevolence and righteousness. If I remain serene, the people will naturally rectify themselves; if I am without desire, the people will naturally return to simplicity.\" The caution against overcooking the fish is not to make it too elaborate. Govern with leniency and love, and you will win the multitude; employ joy in command, and your subordinates will draw near. Thus, Mencius regarded embodying benevolence as peace, while Yang Xiong called Shen Buhai and Han Fei butchers. Excessive reins and tight bridles are not the driving of Master Fu; harsh punishments and severe penalties are not the Way of the Three August Ones and Five Emperors. In the time of Youyu, the hand did not need to wave, the mouth did not need to speak—merely facing south in reverence, and governance flourished in harmony. Fu Sheng merely led by example, strumming his zither and chanting poetry; without descending from his hall, the foolish and wise alike were brought to order.\n\nIf one can enrich the impoverished, lighten taxes, relieve the destitute, promote the overlooked, employ the worthy, encourage agriculture, reduce expenditures, attract the estranged with ritual, and embrace the distant with virtue; if one can mold them with the *Chengjun* and govern them with the *Xiangxu*; if the transformation from above inspires goodness like grass bending before a sudden wind, and those who wash their hearts and reform their faces do so like clear waves rinsing away light dust—then the court will be filled with groups yielding virtue, the countryside will be free of those treading paths of impropriety. The prisons will empty, the weapons of Chu will forever be stilled. Why must rewards and punishments be the means to govern a state?\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Clarify punishments to rectify laws.\" The *Shu* says: \"Pity those in judgment; in court, bestow ranks; in the marketplace, execute punishments.\" This has been so since antiquity. Is it merely that in degenerate times, when benevolence abounds, laws are not established, and when authority is weak, subordinates encroach upon their superiors? If laws are not established, all affairs will be thrown into chaos; if subordinates encroach upon their superiors, rebellious signs will sprout. By the Three Dynasties, the purest essence had already diluted, and the great simplicity further scattered under Qin and Han. The Dao declined in former times, and customs grew shallow in the present. To now seek to restrain and rectify deceit without words, to transform cunning and treachery by relinquishing the reins—this is like riding a galloping horse on a perilous path while discarding the rudder and oars, drifting on a hollow boat to brave the waves; like chasing thieves with bows and courtesies, or slaying Chao Cuo to repel the Seven States; like brandishing weapons to pacify the Red Eyebrows—such measures have never been seen to succeed.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns walked, the Five Emperors trotted, and since the age of hegemons and kings, they have galloped without rest. When governance falters, officials deceive the people with craft, bandits and thieves operate openly. Shaving heads and branding faces are insufficient to punish the shameless; exterminating clans cannot deter covetousness. Multiplying eyes to broaden vision, piling ears to sharpen hearing, raising torches to untangle stagnant affairs, and exhausting the heart to stem the source of treachery—yet still, the marketplace and court echo with sighs, and the frontiers suffer wrongs unheard. Those who wield power to oppress and favor may act beneath the gaze of all; those who harm their families and endanger the state may scheme within their own walls. To govern a decadent age with the Way of Great Heaven, or to quell boiling chaos with a song of uniformity, is to fail to recognize the need to adapt to changing times, to understand the necessity of adjusting gains and losses.\n\nThis is like carving a mark on a boat to seek a lost sword, or shooting an arrow at the sky to hit a target five paces away; like casting aside rhinoceros-hide armor to wade into unfathomable depths, or donning a light robe to endure sweltering heat; like trying to untie a knot by stomping on it, or scratching one’s cheek to relieve an itchy back—nothing could be more foolish. One should first issue commands and only then execute punishments, uncover the truth without delight, so that Bo Shi harbors no resentment for losing his fief, and Yu and Rui know shame without litigation.\n\nIf the violent conceal their nature and wield power without fear, if one tolerates disgrace and lets the weeds grow unchecked, relying on grand words while forgetting the urgency of festering sores—how is this different from one parched with thirst pointing to the distant sea while the water rises to engulf them, or hastily building a boat in the forest as the floodwaters surge? How can one escape the fate of Kuafu or avoid the disaster of drowning?\n\nThe world disparages Shen Buhai and Han Fei’s practical methods while praising Laozi and Zhuangzi’s extravagant theories. Yet in governance, none can do without punishments. Those who kill are pardoned for their deaths; those who injure others are absolved of their crimes—this is like offering mud and broken tiles to starving people in the morning. The words of Daoists may be lofty, but applying them is as impractical as using a *Ganjiang* sword to sew thread, or a giant elephant to catch a mouse; as futile as golden elixirs crossing stormy waves, or jade horses racing a thousand *li*.\n\nIf one were to follow their words, one would burn the stocks and destroy the prisons, abolish officials, erase penal codes, melt down weapons, level city walls, disperse treasuries, destroy tally seals, dismantle barriers, and smash measuring tools. One would blind Li Zhu’s eyes and deafen Shi Kuang’s ears, drifting untethered, returning to nature, untrained and uncaring, forgetting all distinctions between rivers and lakes, court and wilderness. If the world were empty of people, one might never interact until death—such ideas are easy to debate but impossible to practice.\n\nVulgar Confucians only know that Zhou rose through benevolence and Qin fell through severity, yet they fail to realize that Zhou’s success was not purely due to benevolence, nor Qin’s downfall solely due to severity. In ancient times, Zhou employed corporal punishments—amputating feet, slicing noses—and at the covenant of Mengjin, those who arrived late were executed. They swore oaths of collective punishment, yet their actions were not entirely benevolent. By its later years, Zhou neglected laws and played with empty texts; rulers grew tyrannical, edicts failed to reach beyond the cosmos, rituals and music no longer emanated from the throne, and subordinates vied for power like serpents devouring their own tails. They cut off the source and blocked the flow, casting aside caps and tearing robes, some drowning in the Han River, others exiled to Zhi. The defeat of losing authority stemmed from insufficient severity.\n\nQin’s early rise saw officials of talent like Shang Yang and You Yu implementing laws within, while generals like Bai Qi and Wang Jian conquered without. They annexed the weak, attacked the benighted, established dominance, and secured hegemony, swallowing neighbors and crushing rivals, expanding territory and repelling barbarians, transforming like dragons and glaring like tigers—all through clear rewards and certain punishments, laying the foundation for imperial rule. Yet by its later years, Qin grew arrogant in success, indulging in extravagance and excess, compounded by tyranny. They built the Great Wall for ten thousand *li*, constructed over a thousand palaces, amassed bells, drums, and female musicians without moving them. The labor at Mount Li, the taxes of half the land, the conscription of the poor—these, along with the brutality of burying scholars alive, the campaigns against the Xianyun in the north and the Baiyue in the south, mobilized millions of troops for decades. The world mourned separations, every household sighed in resentment; bones piled into mountains, empty sacrifices spread across the fields. Xu Fu departed, and the people wailed in grief; Zhao Gao entered, and the court filled with wolves. The realm sought rebellion, nine out of ten homes stood empty. Was Qin’s downfall truly due to severity? This was Qin gaining through severity, not losing through it.",

      "translated_text": "The twofold purpose of punishments lies in crafting skillful governance, yet those who employ them to their own detriment wound the state instead. A realm governed by the Dao may be aided by punishments, for they suppress deceit and falsehood, guard against depravity, and correct wayward intent—like a net whose ropes are cut, its mesh disordered. To offend Heaven by misapplying punishments is to court swift peril. Water and fire, too, sustain life yet also destroy it, depending on whether one can wield them. If growths and tumors are left untreated and the arts of Bian Que are not practiced, how can one hope to attain the longevity of Lao Peng? When treacherous factions abound yet no strict laws are enforced to curb their transgressions, the blessings of enduring peace remain unseen.\n\nOne must instead select men like Zhang Tang, entrusting them with the administration of law, and appoint officials like Zhao Yu and Chen Chong, charging them with meticulous scrutiny. Let the enlightened ruler remain vigilant above, while loyal and upright ministers devote themselves below. Upon spying wrongdoing, they strike like hawks and falcons seizing sparrows; at the first sign of disorder, they uproot it like weeding a field, cutting away the foul and overgrown. If rewards are never misapplied and executions never miss their mark, then the path to Great Peace need not be trodden anew—transgressions will become rare. Yet to abolish punishments and achieve order? I dare not affirm such a claim.\n\nSome may argue: \"Are punishments not indeed a means to aid instruction, promote goodness, and restrain wickedness?\" As for the corporal punishments of antiquity—might they be restored?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replies: Why should they not? In former times, the Zhou employed corporal punishments for seven hundred years, while the Han abolished them, yet their dynasty did not endure as long. They replaced such punishments with flogging and caning, resulting in many deaths—outwardly a lighter penalty, but in truth, a means of killing. When a crime was too severe for a non-capital sentence, the only recourse was penal servitude, flogging, or caning. If a general amnesty were declared, the offender would suffer no lasting harm, merely shaving the hair of one reborn or striking wounds already healing—hardly sufficient to deter crimes deserving of death.\n\nBy abolishing corporal punishments, no intermediate penalty remains between death and lesser sentences. Thus, those not condemned to death must be punished with penal servitude, flogging, or caning, making it impossible to calibrate severity. Moreover, crimes are infrequent, and when they occur, execution breeds deep resentment, while flogging breeds little. Many would rather risk such penalties. Without corporal punishments, crimes just short of capital offenses often go unpunished.\n\nIf, however, corporal punishments were substituted for death in cases other than treason, rebellion against ruler or kin, military offenses in wartime, or murder by one’s own hand, they would suffice as deterrence. The punished could still perform labor, their lives spared, though their bodies would bear lifelong marks. The sight of such mutilation would chill the hearts of all, instilling fear in those yet to offend and serving as a warning to future generations—far more effective than execution. Though execution is severe, the condemned are buried after three days, their fate unknown to most, unseen by many.\n\nCorporal punishments, however, serve as enduring admonitions. During the Wei dynasty, this matter was debated repeatedly. Eminent scholars, well-versed in governance, universally agreed that corporal punishments should be restored, though dissenting opinions were raised, none held merit. Emperor Wu of Wei concurred but hesitated, for the frontiers remained unsettled, and distant peoples, unaccustomed to unified rule, might misinterpret the amputation of limbs or the severing of ears and noses as cruel tyranny. Thus, he temporarily suspended the practice, awaiting the pacification of all quarters.\n\nThe learned Yang Xiong also advocated for the restoration of corporal punishments, yet their abolition had persisted for so long that those who sat in counsel did not deem it urgent.",

      "translated_text": "**Master Baopu, Outer Chapters, Scroll One**\n*From the Siku Quanshu, \"Baopuzi Inner and Outer Chapters,\" Category: Masters, Daoist Works*\n\n**Scroll Two**\n*By Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty*\n\n**On the Examination and Recommendation of Officials (Shenju, Fifteenth)**\n\nMaster Baopu said: The towering heights of Mount Hua and Mount Heng reach the heavens because their foundations are deep. The resplendent achievements of Yao and Shun were made possible by their worthy ministers. Even with the hands of Sun Yang, without the hooves of a *qiji*, one cannot traverse a thousand *li*. Even with talents steeped in antiquity, without capable aides to execute tasks, one cannot bring order to the myriad affairs.\n\nThough a ruler’s wisdom may rival the sun and moon, and his divine insight perceive the unseen, the ten thousand threads of governance cannot be managed alone, nor can trivial matters be personally overseen. He must rely on eyes to broaden his vision and ears to extend his hearing. Truly, he requires ministers to assist and support him. Thus, the sage-kings of old all rooted their hearts in seeking worthies, making the recommendation of talent their foremost duty. They bestowed jade and silk upon recluses in their hills and forests, dispatched carriages to remote valleys, labored in the search for men, and found ease in employing their abilities. From the lofty halls to the lowliest posts, all—whether discussing the Dao or governing the state—were entrusted with office. Through reverent self-restraint, they achieved effortless rule; through the suspension of punishments, their transformative influence spread without bounds, and the myriad regions knew peace.\n\nOfficials are established and duties assigned as one constructs a house: if a single component is unfit, collapse is inevitable. Yet those who have not yet offered tribute or been recommended are measured by the Four Categories, the Three Affairs, and the Nine Ranks. From these, only the most outstanding and exceptional are selected. But by the late Han, during the reigns of Emperors Huan and Ling, power had slipped from the imperial house into the hands of treacherous ministers. The net of governance was full of holes, the dikes had burst, the wind of virtue had withered, and instruction had faltered. Integrity was suppressed, flattery exalted; those who trod the Way were demoted, while the wealthy and powerful advanced. Competition became the custom, shamelessness the norm. Some offered bribes to sell themselves, others peddled letters of recommendation from influential men. Some relied on the prominence of fathers or elder brothers to secure appointments, while others, through years of bowing and scraping, were eventually recruited.\n\nWhen the scales of selection are unbalanced, weights and measures become confused. When measuring vessels are crooked, quantities are muddled. Without clear standards, right and wrong blur; when the rules are skewed, the impure proliferate. To govern with such men is to invite cruelty and rapacity. They extort and amass wealth to recoup the cost of buying office, and once installed in court, their misrule surpasses tangled silk. They promote the mediocre and incompetent as their clique, and how can one expect the grass to bend before the wind when such men are in charge? Is this not like demanding luminous pearls from worthless shards or pure tones from an untuned instrument?\n\nHow can we fail to purify the turbid, let the light sink, sift the sand, and refine the good from the bad? How can we not tighten the methods of rigorous examination, heighten the barriers against greed, and fear the calamities that arise from such corruption? In ancient times, when feudal lords recommended men of talent, those who chose well were deemed meritorious and rewarded with higher rank and expanded territory. Those who chose poorly were deemed at fault and demoted or stripped of land. Yet even then, they could not escape the *Book of Songs*’ censure of \"great carriages\" and \"eating without labor,\" nor the praise for those who \"cut timber by the river\" and \"set traps for hares.\" How much worse, then, is the crime of recommending the unworthy or the peril of receiving those unfit for office? Once the scales are misaligned, how can the balance of many and few be restored?\n\nThe solitary and lofty, those who conceal their talents awaiting their worth, languish in obscurity and hardship. The petty and frivolous, who curry favor through social connections, seize opportunities and rise swiftly. When owls and vultures soar, mandarin ducks retreat into seclusion; when jackals and wolves dominate the roads, qilin flee. Promote the good and teach the people, and the unvirtuous will distance themselves. When the treacherous and false are honored, the heroic and upright withdraw. Those of noble character disdain association with the base and are ashamed to join the ranks of the gluttonous. If appointments are uniformly misguided, the worthy will seal their talents in silence. When the worthy seal their talents, villains will draw one another in. When villains draw one another in, the path of petty men lengthens. When the path of petty men lengthens, *taowu* and other monsters stand shoulder to shoulder. Thus, songs of praise fall silent, and cries of resentment rise in a clamor.\n\nMen of towering talent, confident in their abilities, bend or stand, speak or remain silent, as fate dictates. They entrust success and failure, poverty and prosperity to nature. How can they avoid falling behind the factions of the powerful and submitting to the strong? Men of extraordinary virtue move only when propriety demands; they stand firm as mountains and still as deep pools. Few recognize them, while the clamorous and ambitious slander and obstruct them. Thus, even a ruler who longs for worthies may never learn where true talent lies. Those who cherish the Dao wish to serve but find no path. Though they possess the talents of Hou Ji and Xie, and the vast capacities to surpass their age, they remain mired in obscurity until death, never gaining rank or office. Meanwhile, those with factions and power gather like scales on a fish. With too few men for too many posts, how can one avoid scooping up and employing even the mediocre?\n\nDuring the reigns of Emperors Ling and Xian, eunuchs held power, and a cabal of villains wielded authority, endangering the loyal and good. In the imperial court, appointments were mismanaged; in the provinces and commanderies, recommendations were treated lightly. When appointments are mismanaged above, governors and prefects are unfit for their posts. When recommendations are treated lightly below, the worthy among the *xiucai* and *xiaolian* are not selected. Thus, the people of the time said: *\"Recommend a* xiucai *who knows no books; examine* xiaoxing *and find the father living apart. The pure and white are muddied like sludge; the finest generals retreat like chickens.\"* They also said: *\"In ancient times, men studied the classics diligently to advance; today, they seek office to avoid work.\"* Such was the depth of their indignation.\n\nAt that time, offices were put up for sale like goods in a marketplace. Those vying for positions bought them like merchants. Those with bribes advanced without qualification; those with empty fists were recruited on sight. The more one paid, the higher the office; the less one paid, the lower the rank. Thus, the Eastern Gardens amassed wealth from selling offices, and Cui Lie was mocked for the stench of copper. The ruler set the example, and the ministers followed suit, exceeding him in excess. Flatterers and favorites monopolized discussions; relatives and hometown acquaintances controlled evaluations. The Ministry of Personnel and the Bureau of Merit became brokers, each demanding their price. How could the poor and upright hope for advancement?\n\nThis was the state of affairs, yet the distinction between right and wrong remained as stark as ice and charcoal. Those who hated integrity despised those not of their faction; those who inverted standards feared others’ judgment. Those who advanced through improper means dreaded unfavorable talk. Thus, they conspired to fabricate slander, heaping false accusations upon the virtuous, creating blemishes where none existed, and none dared to rescue or promote them. As a result, Zeng Shen and Min Sun were slandered like Prince Shang; Confucius and Mozi were defamed like Robber Zhi. Those who cherished integrity and upheld principle perished in the mire, while the cunning and deceitful soared like rainbows. Could one not tremble at the calamities that stem from such a system?",

      "translated_text": "Yet the shallow-minded common folk, unable to distinguish between right and wrong, call those who uphold the Dao \"sunken in obscurity\" and deem those who tread the proper path \"adept at shifting with the times.\" How can those who drift with the wind and flow with the current ever return to the labor of virtue or the toil of learning? Thus, all abandon the wearisome task of self-discipline and rush toward the swift rewards of bribery. This is indeed the very reason the Han dynasty collapsed—a lesson future generations must heed deeply.\n\nSome may say: \"Your critique of the Han’s late-era examination system truly diagnoses its ills. Now, those who wish to avoid past mistakes and steer clear of ruinous paths have adjusted their methods to prevent laxity and corruption. Yet just as the rustic songs of Pu Shang and Ba people have supplanted the proper music of contentment, and as minor ailments of the skin go untreated until they fester, how can one not exert effort to remedy this? There are scholars of fine appearance and noble bearing, their dignified presence overflowing, yet they harbor emptiness within, their substance insufficient. If one judges by appearance alone, worthy talent may not be found; if one tests them gradually, there is no time for haste. What then is to be done?\"\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replies: \"To know others is wisdom—even sages find it difficult. If all governors could discern true talent before its use and ensure the constancy of their nature and conduct, it would indeed be no easy task. Yet if they collectively set aside private interests, exhaust their wisdom, remain unmoved by profit or desire, and refuse to bend to favoritism, then those they wish to recommend must be scrutinized with careful thought, investigated thoroughly, their reputations examined alongside their conduct, discrepancies weighed to expose false adornments. Let their clans praise their filial piety and brotherly love, let their villages attest to their trustworthiness and integrity. If they have held minor office, let their loyalty, purity, and administrative skill be proven—even a single brocade strip reveals craftsmanship, and a mouse’s gnawing tests courage.\n\nFurthermore, all candidates for recommendation and examination should, as before, be tested on the classics and required to compose policy responses. If their answers are fraudulent, they must be permanently barred from office, punished with prohibition from service. If their responses are inadequate, governors and prefects who endorse them should be dismissed; those with many failures should be demoted, while those with few should be restricted in promotion. If one accepts bribes and recommends the unworthy, upon discovery and verification, they shall be stripped of rank, permanently barred from office, and no amnesty shall pardon them. Those they recommend shall share their punishment.\n\nIf this system is enforced for a year or two, many will cease seeking recommendation, and it will become clear how long the empire’s examination system has been imprecise. Beyond this, those who cultivate virtue and diligently study will surely increase.\n\nMoreover, for all officials in office, those guilty of public offenses shall be dealt with according to the law. Those whose crimes of greed and corruption do not warrant death shall, even after completing their sentences or receiving amnesty, be permanently barred from office—lesser offenders for twenty years. Thus, even the corrupt will be transformed into Boyi and Shuqi. But if officials who amass mountains of illicit wealth upon discovery plead for mercy, escape punishment, and within days return to office, even Zeng Shen and Shi Yu will become Robber Zhi.\n\nIf this is so, then even if all recommended scholars are qualified, they will not tolerate the misconduct of their superiors.\"\n\nSome may ask: \"One who speaks well may not act well. Even if a candidate excels in classical examinations and policy responses, how can one be certain of their administrative ability?\"\n\nThe *Baopuzi* answers: \"In ancient times, archery was used to select men—how much more so the mastery of classical arts? If we abandon testing, what other method is superior? This is the way.\"",

      "translated_text": "For lush grasses do not flourish in barren soil, nor do giant fish arise in shallow waters; maxims are not spoken from the mouths of mediocre men, nor do lofty writings fall from the brushes of the dull-witted. Thus, perusing the *Hongfan*, one recognizes that Jizi possessed the instrument for ordering the world; examining the *Nine Strategies*, one sees that Master Fan harbored the art of governing the state; studying the writings of Guan Zhong, one understands his capacity to restore order from chaos; and reading the texts of Shen Buhai, one perceives his mastery of the Dao of hegemony and kingship.\n\nNow, if candidates for filial piety and incorruptibility must be tested on the classics without error, and if cultivated talents must respond to policy questions without missing the intent, then they cannot be obscured or concealed. Even fine generals and high-ranking officers, selected for their courage and martial prowess, are further tested in archery—how much more so for scholars of the literary arts? Even if one cannot guarantee that all selected will be worthy and capable, it is surely better than not testing them at all. Moreover, if this single measure is implemented, all those who ought to be recommended for office throughout the realm will dare not neglect their studies. This one provision alone would greatly benefit the cultivation of customs and education.\n\nIf the realm fears the consequences of reckless recommendations, if all men abandon their pursuit of fortune by chance and return to the foundation of learning, then the Dao of the Ru will flourish, private bribes will gradually cease, extraordinary talents can be employed, and offices will no longer lie vacant.\n\nSome may say: \"Sir, you seek to hasten the laws of recommendation, but the punishment of lifelong禁锢 is too harsh and severe, and many will fear it. Tight reins and frequent checks are what even Bo Le would not employ; strict laws and severe punishments are what virtuous governance shuns.\"\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replies: \"Medicines that nourish the bones and replenish the flesh are excellent for nurturing the body and prolonging life, yet they cannot save one from drowning or heatstroke in an emergency. Governance that emphasizes tolerance and forbearance may befit a simple and honest people, but it is insufficient to rescue a state in decline and chaos. When tigers and wolves press near, if one does not brandish a spear or unsheathe a sword but instead strums the zither and recites poetry, I have yet to see how one’s life can be preserved. When flames engulf a house, if one does not rush to pour water but instead bows and circles in ceremony, I have yet to see how the fire will extinguish itself. To discuss this with those who wish to sell offices is like debating the capture of thieves with Robber Zhi.\"\n\nThe *Baopuzi* says: \"Now, under the unified rule of all under heaven, where the nine regions share a common wind, the king’s institutions and decrees ought to be uniform. Even small measures of weight and volume must not vary from place to place—how much less can the standards for men of talent be left unchecked and inconsistent? Though Jiangbiao is distant, lying near the sea’s edge, it has been steeped in the Dao and transformed by culture for over a thousand years. Though it was once briefly severed for less than a hundred years, the pursuit of Ru learning was never abandoned. Only because its territory is smaller than the Central States is the number of its scholars not equal in size—yet in virtue, conduct, talent, and learning, its finest, such as Ziyu and Ren An, are no less than those of the Central States.\n\nIn the early years of the Wu king, those recommended as candidates were exempted from testing due to their adherence to the established standards. Now, as the era of Great Peace has neared forty years, they are still not tested. This is why the Ru learning of the Southeast has declined compared to the past. Such a policy treats them no differently than those in barbarian dress—it does not distinguish them. Moreover, even the noble-minded treat others with ritual propriety—how much more so should those who are as kind and joyful as parents? Laws that invite calamity and decrees that harm transformation—these are what we speak of.\n\nIf candidates for recommendation are no longer tested, they will surely adorn themselves and vie for empty reputations. Who will then willingly open a book and study? This is what is meant by ‘enriching them only to ruin them.’ There are those with a natural love for antiquity, who delight in the arts and literature, who do not serve for salary, who savor the Dao and forget poverty—men like Gao Qing and Zhou Shenglie, whose learning is profound yet who do not seek office, who follow the Way and spurn glory and profit. Such men are one in ten thousand. As for those like Ning Yue, Ni Kuan, and Huang Ba, their diligent self-discipline in the classics was not innate but arose from suffering, hardship, and distress, through which they sought to elevate themselves by means of classical arts. Had it not been for the age of Emperor Wu of Han, even men like Zhu Maichen and Yan Zhu would not have read books.\n\nNow, if the path to wealth and honor is readily available, and those who happen to have some inclination toward learning yet lack a natural love for it, how will they willingly endure hardship, perform menial tasks as students, travel far to seek teachers, and inquire after the Dao? In times of war, martial prowess is prized and literary arts decline; common men regard Ru scholars as servants and slaves, and view the classics and treatises as worthless weeds and dust.

My suggestion is this: for those to be tested in the imperial examinations next year, this year should see the appointment of learned officials and talented scholars to devise comprehensive preventive measures. All drafts should be collected and sealed within the palace halls. At the time of the examination, the questions should be swiftly distributed, and all personal connections and influences thereby severed. Those responsible for overseeing the process should be gathered in one place, with high-ranking officials from the central government personally supervising and strictly prohibiting any collusion. All communication and entry or exit should be forbidden until the examination is complete. Violators should be punished without pardon.

      "translated_text": "If the examination system for the classics is established, then the empire cannot but establish official academies, and people will naturally devote themselves to study. During the Han dynasty, the Four Categories of Examination included a clear understanding of laws and ordinances as a path to officialdom. Yet today, those in office—regardless of rank—are largely ignorant of the law. Some legal texts are obscure and difficult to comprehend, while petty clerks, often obstinate, are left to adjudicate cases. Thus, matters of life and death are entrusted to the frivolous, and the lives of the common people are placed in the hands of the uninformed. When officials themselves do not know the law, they are deceived by their subordinates without realizing it. Those who draft judgments are often muddled, unable to discern whether a case conforms to the law or not. They do not inquire nor refer it to the proper authority, but instead decide matters by whim, stumbling and erring without regard for the law. If upright and capable officials were all required to pass an examination on the laws and ordinances—just as they are tested on the classics—and those who scored highest were appointed according to their talent and rank, then the empire would surely see fewer officials who manipulate the law and fewer unjust verdicts.\n\n**On Interpersonal Relations (Section Sixteen)**\nThe *Baopuzi* states: I hold that friendships should not be tainted by superficiality or insincerity. Yang Yunyou criticized those who, though equal in status, reputation, lineage, or age, diverge in conduct and aspirations, and with such men I have never associated. Some flaunt their seniority or stride ahead with lofty disdain; others neglect old friendships that have declined or dismiss promising newcomers as unrefined. Some judge others by rank rather than virtue; others, though talented, wise, pure in conduct, and noble in character, are overlooked because they have not encountered a true patron. Meanwhile, those who happen to rise in rank or gain office—though dull and mediocre—are inevitably sought after. Such men may command fleeting influence, making insects soar and sparrows reach the heavens, wielding power like a blade or a measure to dispense fortune and misfortune. When they favor someone, they exalt them with dazzling splendor; when they withdraw, they leave them withered like plants in spring. I am too constrained and ashamed to share the world with them, whether in adversity or prosperity.\n\nYet frivolous men, lacking any sense of integrity, never reproach themselves. With unwavering resolve, they rush through the night to guard the gates of the powerful, fawning and flattering with obsequious words and pleasing expressions. They carry wine and gifts, seeking favor through persistent toil. Even after long effort, they may still be spurned, only to resort to intermediaries to secure an introduction. When accepted, their joy surpasses that of a prisoner granted amnesty; when rejected, their dejection exceeds that of one stricken by illness or bereavement. But success and failure are matters of fate, and the Dao values uprightness. Prosperity and adversity are left to nature—why lament the paths one takes? Are such petty men not contemptible?\n\nHuman dispositions differ, yet how far apart are they truly? I often sigh and feel shame for them. Once, Zhuangzi saw the multitude of followers in Zhuangzi’s retinue and discarded his remaining fish. I, too, lament that worldly men do not eagerly seek worthy connections. Gazing at those who gallop through the dust, I see they do not strive to cultivate virtue or seek improvement within themselves. Instead, they chase after influential friends to form cliques, believing no principle more essential and no urgency greater in the world. Those who stand firm and independent are dismissed as stingy and inept, while those who grovel with servile deference are praised for understanding the ways of the world. Such customs have become ingrained, and none escape their sway—how lamentable!\n\nSome men, though morally deficient and high in rank, are swollen with arrogance and avarice. At the mention of wealth, they startle and tremble; when they encounter extraordinary men, they doze off. Threadbare scholars in coarse robes, carrying satchels—though their learning shines and their wisdom runs deep—are treated as dust and weeds, never welcomed. Yet men like Cheng Zheng and Wangsun Jia, who ride in fine carriages, wear luxurious robes, and carry gold and jade, though ignorant of even basic propriety, are met with haste, their food spat out and hair grasped in eagerness. I regret not holding office, for without the axe and its handle, I cannot purge the state of such filth, banishing them to the four frontiers or casting them into the northern wastes. Though they may blaze with power, wielding authority like a blade or a measure, their influence enough to move mountains and uproot seas, their breath enough to lift one from the mire to the clouds—if they come to my gate, I have no time for them. Yet many lower themselves, forcing smiles and crawling forward to seek their favor, hoping for some benefit. Alas, how vast is the gulf between the intentions of the living and the unworthy!\n\nI live in a sagely age yet remain mired in obscurity and lowliness. Looking back, I see none who once shared my path, and now, gazing ahead, I cannot catch up. Is there no reason for this? Yet if my nature cannot endure it, I must follow my own inclinations—this is a principle I cannot abandon.\n\nSome may object: Times change, and the world shifts; ancient and modern pursuits differ. One must act according to the present, establish a name, and achieve success. Those who carry gold and jade through peril are like those who entrust themselves to a light boat. The phoenix that gathers in the empyrean relies on the power of flight. The fragrance of orchids is the work of the clear wind. The reclusive scholar who rises from obscurity is aided by a true patron. Now, sir, you insist on befriending only those of pure conduct and refined character, favoring only the most discerning. Alone and aloof, you lose the company of your peers, making enemies of the world and drawing the scorn of the vulgar. How does this align with the lofty principle of harmonizing with the world while preserving one’s integrity?\n\nIf you compare wisdom before befriending, even a commoner in a thatched hut would not deign to associate with the noble Duke of Zhou. If you measure talent before associating, even Confucius would have no disciples entering his inner chamber.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replies: I have heard that those who choose friends carefully do not lose worthy companions, while those who form indiscriminate bonds often regret it. Thus, the sages of old selected friends before forming ties, not the other way around. Your argument is a worldly calculation; my resolve is the resolve of a reclusive scholar.",

      "translated_text": "You speak of jade floating and birds soaring—all have their causes, and indeed, this may be a distinct principle, a doctrine of its own. Yet I would rather be an uncarried treasure, an unsoaring roc, an unscented orchid. Moreover, is not the scholar diminished by possessing the luster of night-shining pearls, the vastness of the sky-spanning wings, the fragrance of everlasting blossoms, or the immortality of the orchid?\n\nFurthermore, when fame exceeds reality and rank surpasses talent, those who hold such positions seldom escape calamity or disgrace—how then can associating with them be considered honor or fortune? By this reasoning, even if one befriends them and gains success, it is not truly worthy; if one shelters under them and errs, it is like relying on a rotten tree to brace a collapsing beam. If they cannot even prevent their own downfall, how can they save me from a shattered skull?\n\nI have heard that the true man, self-sufficient and beyond external things, regards the common crowd as if pressed into unavoidable contact—though they number in the thousands, they are but lice infesting his robes or wens clustering on his body. To lose them, though they number in the tens of thousands, is like flying dust leaving Mount Song or withered branches falling from Deng Forest. How can their presence be counted a gain, or their absence felt as a loss?\n\nAs for friendship, it must be founded on those who are upright, candid, and learned—who correct one’s errors, reject falsehoods, speak without being asked, and make no excuses even in death; whose bond remains unbroken through winter’s cold and summer’s heat. Yet such people are not easily found. Some diverge in speech and path, others shift in love and hate; some unite in prosperity and part in decline, while others forget loyalty at the sight of profit. In today’s world, such friendships are like birds and fish forming bonds or ice and charcoal sharing a vessel—how can their union endure?\n\nEven between father and son, bound by nature, preferences should align, yet Zizheng and Zijun differed in judgment, and Boqi of Nanshan disputed with his father, their faces turned away and hearts divided. Such discord has existed since ancient times. To lump them all together—is this not difficult indeed?\n\nThe common crowd forms bonds without regard for shared purpose, chasing fame and following power. They flock when warm and scatter when cold, refuse to correct faults, and ignore those lost in delusion. When profit arises, they seize it alone without sharing; when harm comes, they flee to save themselves without aid. When opportunity favors, they take first without yielding; when danger looms, they betray others to secure themselves. With friends like these, it would be better to have none. The world is not entirely devoid of suitable companions, but those who bring benefit are few, while those who create burdens are many.\n\nDiscerning others is a skill even the greatest sages find difficult. Yet those of limited talent, lacking in judgment, seek to broaden their circle, hoping all will stand firm through peril and hardship, bearing each other’s burdens through adversity. I have never seen such abundance. Even searching for flawless jade atop a mound or phoenixes in a wren’s nest would not be as hard.\n\nI do not dare claim that beyond the southern slopes of Lantian or within the cinnabar caves of Danxue, no such people exist—only that they are rare indeed. When natures differ, gold sinks while feathers float; when aspirations clash, fire rises while water descends. Even the craft of Creation or the skill of the Great Potter cannot force alignment—how then can it be compelled?\n\nAs for myself, I am by nature dull and slow, further burdened by a heaven-given laziness. Games of skill, gambling, and all frivolous amusements I despise; racing, hunting, and idle wandering I do not pursue. I have no taste for jesting or banter—all these are the pleasures of the age, yet I lack them entirely. Thus, my close companions are few.\n\nMoreover, I cling to honesty and freely speak my loyal counsel. Few willingly accept bitter medicine, and I further expect them to heed my advice, to curb their recklessness, to temper their excesses—all things the common crowd finds displeasing. To cast aside one’s true nature for hollow conformity, to force oneself into the mold of others’ affections—this I cannot bear. Yet if I persist unchanged, can I not be called blind to the times and inept in great matters?\n\nIf friendships do not endure, if bonds form only to break, both parties earn a reputation for inconstancy and lose the beauty of a lasting union. When closeness fades, affection turns to resentment; when distance grows, suspicion takes root. This is the natural course—how can one not choose carefully?",

Those who fear water need not abandon boats and oars; those who dread injury need not forsake axes and adzes. The Way of companionship has been esteemed since ancient times. If Heaven and Earth do not join, there is no great harmony; if high and low do not unite, their aspirations diverge. Without great harmony, the two qi remain divided; when aspirations diverge, the world has no true states.\n\nYet while beginnings are easy, endings prove difficult. The danger lies in binding oneself to the wrong person, squandering the great for petty strife. The *Book of Changes* praises \"gold and orchid,\" and poetry sings of \"a hundred friends.\" Though one may have brothers, they are not like friends born of shared purpose. The Three Beneficial Bonds were cherished even by the greatest sages. Disciples honor their masters, harsh words do not arise, and Guan Zhong escaped execution to establish the Five Hegemons—all through the power of friendship. Ziyuan abandoned his post as village chief to ride in the vermilion carriage, likewise by the strength of his companions.\n\nA single flute cannot produce the harmony of *Shao* and *Xia*; a lone hue cannot complete the splendor of dragon-embroidered robes.

      "translated_text": "When true friends unite, the Way of assisting virtue is perfected. The enlightened understand this well. In their aspirations, they carefully choose those who surpass them; in their humbler associations, they discern those of like mind. When together, they discourse on the Dao and advance in power; when apart, they harmonize their hearts like paired wings. In times of prosperity, they collaborate in worldly affairs; in times of peace, they refine their understanding of principle. In peril, they succor one another. They would feel shame if their praise of one another were confined to two distant lands, lest Wangsun and Gongyu alone be celebrated for their cap-brushing friendship. Only then is the Way of old companionship truly esteemed.\n\nYet discerning true from false is no easy task. The rise of power and profit breeds shifts in allegiance; accumulated slander erodes even neck-severing pacts, and gradual corrosion dissolves the firmest bonds of glue and lacquer. Thus, some lament the loss of former affection, while others bear grudges over trivial slights, forgetting past ties. The friendship of Yuanbo and Juqing shines only in antiquity, while the betrayals of Zhang Er and Chen Yu recur even today—a lamentable pattern. The phoenix does not perch on the same branch as the owl; the qilin does not herd with wolves. Clear springs do not mingle with muddy torrents; the wise and enlightened do not dwell with the deceitful and benighted. Why? Because gradual contamination corrupts, and the straight path, when violently coerced, invites harm.\n\nSomeone asked, \"May I inquire how to preserve the Way of perfect friendship?\"\n\nThe Master of Plainness replied: \"When a gentleman severs ties, he does so without malice—how could he then speak ill of a former friend? He would sacrifice his life for a friend—how could he compete over rank or status? In good friendship, there is intimacy without disrespect, harmony without conformity. If a friend errs, he admonishes him with solemnity; if he is told of his own faults, he corrects them without hesitation. He does not withhold counsel to avoid offending, nor reject advice to spare his own ears. He does not use clever rhetoric to excuse wrongs, nor flowery words to gloss over faults. He does not feign agreement while harboring discord, nor conceal true feelings behind a false smile. He does not flatter to his face and despise behind his back. He does not resent another’s superiority but guards against his own shortcomings, drawing out their strengths while concealing their faults. Externally, he is free from scheming slander; internally, he sheds the burden of rivalry. Only then is the bond of *Lu Ming* preserved and the sting of *Fa Mu* silenced.\n\nYet some treat friendship lightly, forming bonds without weight, deepening ties without difficulty, only to thin them just as easily. What begins like shadow and echo ends as distant as Shen and Chen. The closest camaraderie turns to bitter enmity; clasped hands become sworn foes. Such misfortune leaves no path for redress.\n\nIn the decline of the Han, the reins of governance slackened, and public duty waned. The customs of contention flourished, where defying the times was deemed purity, and saving the world was seen as shame. The great bonds of hierarchy and propriety collapsed. Those in office neglected their duties, chasing superficial acclaim over substance. State affairs were abandoned for hollow praise; corruption accumulated, yet their merits were lauded. None failed to spur their carriages, racing through frost and heat to the gates of the powerful, adorning their names with empty splendor in the mouths of the influential, securing undeserved ranks from the merchants of office. When desires clashed, they turned on one another in mutual slaughter.\n\nThus, Gongshu Chang, distressed by such decay, lacked the strength to correct it but could not bear to witness it. In outrage, he penned his treatise, barred his door, and severed all ties. This was indeed a passionate response to the times—yet in overcorrecting, he strayed from the eternal teachings. One should simply distance oneself from corrupt factions and guard against the roots of flattery. Why must one strip naked to shame the extravagant or starve to mock the gluttonous?\n\nIf repeated admonitions go unheeded and great disorder ensues, then the abandonment of ritual and propriety may be justified.\n\n---\n\n**On Recognizing Limitations (Chapter Seventeen)**\nThe Master of Plainness said: The finest steed may gallop across the plains, outstripping the sun, yet cannot tread upon ice to cross deep waters. The fierce tiger may roar like thunder and rend its prey, yet cannot soar through clouds to ascend the heavens. The great roc cannot flap its wings within a cage, nor can the swift sparrowhawk strike like lightning at the banquet table. All things have their limits—so too do people.\n\nThus, one who harmonizes yin and yang may not excel in all virtues; one who masters the great classics may falter in minor details. Hui Shi, paragon of prime ministers, could not command a boat to brave the waves. Emperor Gaozu, peerless in martial prowess, could not manage his household or regulate his conduct. Han Xin, master strategist, could not tend to farming or trade to escape hunger and cold. Zhou Bo, pillar of the state, could not answer questions on finances or legal disputes.\n\nIf we discard the long for the short, then the talents of Yi Zhi and Fu Yue would go unused. If we demand perfection in both grand and trivial matters, then the achievements of those who govern the world and aid its people would never be recognized.\n\nHeaven cannot level its northwest; earth cannot elevate its southeast. The sun and moon cannot illuminate dark crevices; the wind cannot stir waves in a well. A toothpick cannot match the pine or oak in length; an ear pick cannot rival the rafters in size. A pellet of mud can fell a bird worth a thousand gold, while a needle of a few fen outstrips a long sword in sewing. Why must one harness a great elephant to catch a rat or enlist the roc to herald the dawn?\n\nThus, Jiang Ziya sold fish without success before finding his master in King Wen and Wu. Jiang Sheng was scorned in a hundred villages before standing unmatched among the Three Huai.\n\n---\n\n**On Selecting Talent (Chapter Eighteen)**\nThe Master of Plainness said: Ornate prose is not for the blind to appreciate; extraordinary talent is not for the shallow to recognize. If one’s gaze cannot reach others, then dragon-embroidered robes and plain hemp are valued the same. If one’s judgment cannot discern, then the brilliant and the mediocre are judged alike.\n\nWhat the eye does not see, the spirit does not embrace. Where no comparison is made, harm inevitably follows. Moreover, love and hate, approval and disdain, have never been uniform across time. Customs shift, and the same object may command a high price in one era and be worthless in another. The jade pendant of the Xia sovereigns, once prized beyond cities, is now cheaper than bronze or iron. Thus, reclusion to pursue one’s aspirations was once the mark of a noble scholar, but today, mountain-dwelling scholars are deemed unworthy. The pillars of sagacity in ancient times have become the criminals of benighted ages; the steadfast rocks of the past are the feeble remnants of later days.\n\nThe noble man who walks the Dao is not merely a towering wall of a thousand fathoms—his depth is vaster than the Lüliang rapids. Yet the shortsighted and narrow-minded cannot appreciate him, just as the shallow cannot fathom him. Thus, they deem him strange and belittle him, resent him for not seeking their favor, and despise him for not valuing their approval. If he is not esteemed or employed, what more is there to say?",

      "translated_text": "Thus, there are those who cast dust upon white jades, who breed sores upon skin of jade—slandering flaws in unison, they assail the independent, as if Zeng Shen were a bandit or a robber, and as if Chao Fu and Xu You had been thieves and burglars. If not for the luminous mirror of the Dark Heavens to reveal the subtle, who could sift through mud to draw forth sunken jade, or dredge the river to pluck pearls from the depths?\n\nWhen fine jades lie unsold in the marketplace, how much worse their fate when veiled in uncut stone? When extraordinary scholars are barred at the gate, how much more so when they remain hidden in the marshes? Sun Bin longed to deploy his secret strategies, yet Sima Qian had his feet cut off; Han Fei wished to establish his governance, yet Li Si had him killed; Jia Yi was impassioned with statecraft, yet was pushed aside by warriors; Liu Xiang, loyal and upright, possessed the tools to save a nation in peril, yet was ensnared by Hong and Xian. Thus, Bian He wept blood while clutching his uncut jade, and Qin Xi shattered his skull in despair.\n\nJade and stone are easily distinguished, just as the worthy and the foolish; the love for treasures runs deep, as does the fondness for scholars. Yet even when precious gems—so readily discerned—are paired with objects of profound affection, they still incur punishment and mutilation through the ages, enduring false accusations. How much worse, then, for the worthy, who are difficult to recognize and not a priority in the minds of men? When nothing is there to guard against, schemers still draw legs on snakes; treacherous ministers fear the harm of loyalty and integrity. Those who bend their bodies resent the upright bearing of Mohist scholars; those who strip naked at night despise the coming of a bright candle. Thus, lofty reputations and virtuous deeds are suppressed and uncelebrated, while baseless slander takes shape before its shadow, emerging without cause. Without a Chu man’s wailing recommendation, a one-in-ten-thousand encounter is all the more impossible—such is only fitting.\n\nFor those who take jade to be stone will also take stone to be jade; those who take the worthy to be fools will also take fools to be worthy.",

      "translated_text": "Taking stone for jade does no harm, but taking fools for the worthy is the diagnostic sign of ruin. For when ruin is diagnosed, though one may yet live, one is bound to perish—just as when the pulse is dead, though one may yet breathe, one is bound to die. Can one not be cautious?\n\nAlas! How tragic that none reflect on this. Of old, Confucius, the supreme sage, was entangled by the men of Qi in the east and blocked by Zixi in the south. Wen Zhong, a man of great worth, was at first not even acknowledged by the customs of Jing, and in the end, though he wandered in the courts of kings, he could not establish his merit in his prime. Is this not difficult?\n\nFor jade like Jielü and Heili cannot be sold without a Tao Qi; a weight of a thousand jun cannot be lifted without a Meng Ben or Wu Huo; the strains of \"White Snow\" cannot be played without a Ling Su; and talent surpassing the common run cannot be employed without an enlightened lord. Yet luminous pearls, treasures of the night, do not dim their essence for lack of seekers nor sell themselves cheaply to base merchants. Great bells and Zhou tripods do not, for being cast aside, diminish their dignity nor accept elevation by dwarfs. The zithers of Yiyang and Yunhe do not, for being unused, cease their song to vie with lewd melodies. Virtues that crown the multitude do not, for being suppressed, tread the byways or sever their integrity to follow the vulgar.\n\nThus, the He-bi jade becomes stagnant goods; supple wood is discarded as useless; the ore of the Red Blade never passes through the furnace of Ou Ye; and the ranks of the Yuan Kai never gain the opening of the Four Gates.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Mandate**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: Among my friends there is one called the Recluse of Cold Lodge. Serene and joyful, pure and still, he forgets both form and spirit. Outwardly, he does not adorn himself with the guise of startling the foolish; inwardly, he does not harbor the mind of deliberate action. His spirit roams the ancient texts, and his joy makes him forget sorrow. His brush races the last rays of Fuxi and Nüwa; his gaze lingers on the afterglow of Wangshu. The Dao is never too distant for him to guard against; his words, though subtle, are never unrefined. Yet his carriage does not halt at the gates of the powerful and influential; his letters do not pass through the courts of the noble and mighty. Thus, his name does not leave his thatched door; his person does not depart his furrowed fields.\n\nThereupon, the Winged Brightness Grandee questioned and challenged him, saying: \"I have heard that when the coiled dragon rises, dark clouds gather; when the transforming influence of the Dao spreads, hidden talents emerge. Thus, the broad streets resound with the songs of unicorns; the sacrificial vessels bear the traces of soaring winds. When such influence touches them, they reap profits beyond measure; when it spurs them, they ascend beyond the heavens. They shine with dazzling light in the Valley of the Sun; they spread great brightness through the Nine Heavens. Their merit casts a shade that endures forever; their fame resounds without limit. Therefore, though the path of a thousand ren is near, those who do not walk it cannot reach it, even with the speed of the wind. Though the space beneath the eaves is low, those who do not rise cannot attain it, even with the wings of the great peng.\"",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, how can one who rests content beyond the vast wilderness, who folds their wings upon the branches of secluded parasols, ever hope to emulate the trustworthy, chase the light, or shake off their lightness beneath the azure vault?\n\nAlas! The span of years swiftly fades, never to return; the world drifts like a fleeting shadow, never to repeat. The wise tread upon frost and know the inevitable coming of solid ice; dwelling in beginnings, they perceive the destined end of all living things. The six dragons hasten their course through the great chaos; the peak of glory vanishes in an instant, announcing dusk. Thus did the ancients reflect upon the current, sighing in decline, or glance at the passing gap and rise in sorrow.\n\nThe Master possesses a transcendent capacity born of the age, harboring sublime excellence beyond the common, his keen brush vast and deep as surging waves, his sixfold ingenuity pent up in profound reserve. Yet he cannot ascend the swaying heights, nor soar aloft to shine with pure radiance through the Nine Mysteries. His vessels remain unarrayed at the end of the ritual stands; his person is not spared the toil of bearing firewood. Still, he offers harmonious tones in a deafened world, peddles ceremonial caps in a land of unbound hair—vainly striving to awaken the literary realm, sharpening his intent to fathom the divine, cherishing jade-like purity within his embrace, and pouring forth gem-like words from brush and ink. His body suffers the hardship of repeated want; his spirit labors between steadfastness and loftiness. It is as though a foot-long jade disk were buried beneath layers of earth, or brocade were sealed within a locked coffer—forever without the wealth of exchange, who would recognize the treasure thus concealed?\n\nWhen the dragon and steed are fettered, how can they be distinguished from the lame donkey? When the red blade sheathes its edge, how does it differ from a leaden knife? The sturgeon and salmon do not dwell in ox tracks; the great peng does not linger in the brushwood. I wish the Master would forsake the dragon-serpent’s den, ascend the path of advantage and visibility, cast off the seclusion of his courtyard, and awaken from the two mice. Let him depart the barren valley to scale the heights, don the crimson robes to replace the plain, and vie with the dawn’s swift winds rather than tarry through the night. Let him gather his noble vessels in the exalted realm, turn toward the blessings of tripods and cauldrons, and in the evening become a man of renown—what need has he to admire the fern-picking hermit?\n\nResiding in the cold, the Master replied: I have heard that the subtle mechanism of the spirit is distant and obscure, the mingling of fortune and misfortune entwined in the interplay of concealment and revelation, the rise and fall entangled in the ebb and flow. The fleeting cannot escape the shadow that pursues the body; the joyful in success cannot avoid the ruin of principle. The craftsman who chases the branch’s end does not match one who emerges from the primal forge; the one who mends the already-made does not equal one who returns to the source beyond the uncarved block.\n\nThus, the wise inchworm willingly bends to preserve its extension; the one who discerns closure and opening does not grieve or rejoice over adversity or prosperity. Moreover, the great potter shapes things, the great image flows through forms—yet haste and stillness diverge in aspiration, soaring and sinking clash in disposition. Gold and jade are heavy; feathers and down are light. The narrow-minded cling to the dregs; the profoundly enlightened roam free in the pure and mysterious. The stagnant marsh accepts the trickling stream yet chokes on the vast sea; the whale swallows a hundred rivers yet remains unfilled. The goby and shrimp leap joyfully in the mire; the red dragon soars mightily through the lofty heights. Those who chew the fragrant bait rush to their death in pursuit of desire; those who savor emptiness and blandness embrace the harmony of heaven and hasten toward life. The one who recognizes the divine mechanism gazes upon the formless without confusion; the one blind to fortune and misfortune is startled by the strong crossbow’s bolt. Each clings to their preferences—how could they willingly change their course?\n\nI have heard that the five jades cannot carve themselves from the Song Mountains; the soaring serpent cannot streak like lightning without mist. The dragon’s abyss cannot sever rhinoceros hide without grasping its blade; the great bell cannot resound without being struck. The golden fungus requires the autumn wind to gleam; the oriole awaits the misty haze to refine its song. The fine steed does not recklessly gallop into peril; the noble man does not risk his name through deceitful encounters. When fate is adverse, he sinks into obscurity; when the time is right, he soars high in the celestial court. The scholar who advertises himself is not truly lofty; the woman who offers herself is not truly chaste. Why must one emulate the lofty standard of washing one’s ears or imitate the honor of bearing the sacrificial stand?",

      "translated_text": "When one is in dire straits, Yu the dancer may whirl in obscurity while the great Taifu Lü Shang is driven away by a foolish old woman; Fan Li suffers humiliation amid the reeds of a sinking mat. Men of refined bearing conceal their brilliance in farming and herding. Yet when their time comes, the Huaiyin Marquis casts his fishing rod and declares himself sovereign; Wen Zhong removes his straw sandals to don the azure sash; Fu Yue lays down his trowel to discourse on the Dao; Guan Zhong sheds his shackles to become chief minister. The noble man stores his talents in readiness, accumulates virtue for action—when the time is not right, he does not appear; when the lord is not worthy, he does not serve. Rise and fall depend on circumstance, while withdrawal or advancement is not bound to any fixed course. In stillness, he becomes the paragon of recluses; in action, the model of great ministers. Some devote their thoughts to establishing words; others inscribe merit in the vessels of state. Though their paths differ, their ultimate aim is one.\n\nA scholar may cultivate conduct worthy of honor, yet cannot compel the world to honor it; he may possess talents fit for use, yet cannot compel the age to employ them. Clad in coarse cloth, eating wild herbs, angling for fish and setting snares for rabbits, his heart is joyful and his mind content, as if he would spend his life thus. Donning court robes, riding in carriages, draped in crimson and girded with purple, he remains as if these were his natural garb, like a commoner in plain clothes—such is the bearing of the perfected man. If one possesses the treasures of the banquet hall yet lacks the purity of a life confined to four bare walls, the fault is one’s own. That few recognize one’s worth, that rank and position do not come—if jade is called stone, if the phoenix is mistaken for a quail, the blame is not mine.\n\nTo fret over recognition or chafe at obscurity is the way of ordinary men. To nurture qi with boundless composure and desires with serene indifference—this is the state of one free from vexation. When the time is right, the Dao is practiced and one’s vessel is great; yet the heavens and earth do not rejoice. The man who understands fate does not grieve.\n\nAs for those who peddle goods worth ten thousand in hopes of a hundredfold return, losing their very flesh and bones in the bargain—I have no leisure for such pursuits.\n\n**On Names and Reality (Chapter Nineteen)**\n\nA disciple asked: “I have heard that in the late Han, during the reigns of Emperor Ling and Emperor Xian, evaluations of men became chaotic and reckless. The talented and reclusive languished in obscurity while the gluttonous and rapacious rose to power. Names no longer matched reality; prices no longer reflected value. Those who prospered were deemed worthy, while those who struggled were called fools. What was the reason for this?”\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity replied: “The thunderclap may roar, yet some do not hear it; the seven luminaries traverse the sky, yet some do not see them. Is it only the senses that suffer deafness and blindness? The heart and spirit may be equally obscured. Thus, one may hear profound words yet fail to recognize them—not for lack of ears. One may see extraordinary men yet fail to know them—not for lack of eyes. It is because one’s hearing does not reach the subtle, one’s vision does not attain the marvelous.”",
      "overlap_context": "oriole awaits the misty haze to refine its song. The fine steed does not recklessly gallop into peril; the noble man does not risk his name through deceitful encounters. When fate is adverse, he sinks into obscurity; when the time is right, he soars high in the celestial court. The scholar who advertises himself is not truly lofty; the woman who offers herself is not truly chaste. Why must one emulate the lofty standard of washing one’s ears or imitate the honor of bearing the sacrificial stand?",

      "translated_text": "Those of great wisdom and far-reaching capacity stand firm as mountains, while those of petty intellect and narrow ambition drift like tumbleweeds or float as duckweed. Only by standing as mountains can one remain unshaken; only by floating as duckweed can one flow without stagnation.\n\nIn the realm of goods, those sealed and stored in wait for buyers are often the rarest treasures, hardest to sell, while those loudly touted with drums are quickly exhausted, though flawed. In the realm of talent, those whose roots run deep in the sacred peaks may tower a thousand *ren* and spread their canopies over ten thousand *mu*, yet go unnoticed; those planted along the thoroughfares, though crooked and meager, though swift to rot, are still put to use. Thus, the ancestral halls hold withered willows carved into ritual vessels, while the remote valleys teem with catalpas left uncut. Those who usurp the name of blossoms soar like ants into the clouds; those who lose their true worth sink like jade dragons into the Nine Springs. Thereupon, the sparrow hawks beat the wind in lofty flight, while the divine phoenix folds its wings in seclusion. Lead and tin fill the treasuries of *Tai’e* blades, while dogs and sheep, frivolous in gait, assume the guise of tigers and wolves.\n\nThe flatterer, wielding precious bribes as mighty wings, reaches heights unattainable; riding factions as boats and oars, crosses distances unnavigable. Rising early, standing at attention, anticipating desires, and obeying commands—his glib tongue and artful words seem eloquent; his hearsay and gossip seem learned; his treacherous heart wears a gentle face, seeming kind; his filthy deeds appear pure, seeming upright; his delight in others’ faults seems loyal; his disregard for taboos seems forthright. Thus, he gains much access.\n\nMoreover, those who curry favor hope for my desires, and I desire what they desire; those who do not seek me, I cannot love—such is the natural principle. The worthy are ever few, the foolish ever many; the many form cliques to conceal flaws, while the few stand alone and unsupported. Flatterers draw one another up, blocking the right path; the wise and sagacious remain in lowly positions, unseen. The way of the thatched hut is violated, and those who ride oxcarts rise in swarms. The lofty dragon falls, weeping blood in streams. Zixi banished the great sage Confucius; Zang Cang slandered the epochal Mencius—neither of these two escaped such misfortune. How much less, then, those who come after? This calamity has arisen alongside the opening of the universe, and its bitterness is not confined to a single age.\n\nLooking back through the ages, this affliction has been common. The slow and lame crane their necks in ornate carriages, while swift steeds are left to pasture in the wilds. Some already occupy the seats of state, exhausting the nation; others are exiled to Shen and Hai; some have their sinews torn out in the ancestral temple; others meet their end at Wangyi. All because what they guarded was not true, and loyal ability went unused.\n\nThus, the enlightened ruler diligently seeks the worthy and eagerly promotes the extraordinary, clearing obstructions and strictly preventing blockages. When talent is truly sufficient for the task, he does not scruple over butchers or fishermen; when words are verified as sound, he draws them from the ranks of soldiers or exiles. Some are raised from the cattle’s mouth to join the ranks of officials; some are lifted from fetters to bear the weight of the state. Only thus can great deeds be accomplished, frontiers expanded, distant lands subdued, might established, and achievements endure, passing down through the ages.\n\nThe upright and honest are hated by crooked wood; the pure and impartial are despised by the treacherous. If the ruler cannot wield the dark mirror to search out the hidden but must rely on those in power to make recommendations, then, observing past ages, one finds that those who monopolize authority invariably promote only their own adherents.",

      "translated_text": "Those who seek personal gain slander what they fear and promote what they favor—what they fear are the utterly impartial, while what they favor are those who share their private interests. When the utterly impartial are employed, cliques of treachery are shattered; when a multitude of private interests prevail, the ruler’s authority is usurped. The shattering of treacherous cliques is the path to prosperity and peace; the usurpation of the ruler’s authority is the gradual onset of peril and ruin. In slandering what they fear, they fear that their words are not cutting enough—even mutilation by amputation or disfigurement would not satisfy them, and thus they must eliminate such men to feel at ease. In promoting what they favor, they find even the most lavish praise insufficient—even meteoric advancement would not content them, and thus they must endanger others to secure their own position. Hence, those who embrace injustice and die, or those without fault who are demoted, have long had their origins here.\n\nThus, those who embody the Dao and align with truth stand towering and apart, their talents far-reaching and their aspirations lofty, their conduct as pure as frost and their thoughts as boundless as heaven and earth. Their bearing is as measured as the scales of Yu and Kai, their demeanor as deep and still as a hidden abyss, as steadfast as a mountain. They would rather preserve their integrity in obscurity than bow in servility for fleeting gain; they delight in hunger and humble dwellings to uphold their noble principles. They conceal their talents and preserve their true nature, awaiting the natural end of their years, emerging only when the time is right, acting only when propriety demands. Clad in coarse cloth, chewing on wild greens, they remain untroubled. Though their hair may turn yellow with age and their fate remain unfulfilled, they feel no regret. How could they stoop to the height of Mount Tai to fit a square peg, or gather the wings of the heavens to serve as a morning alarm? How could they submit to the ranks of petty officials, stifled beneath the mediocre, abandon the forests of the phoenix to dwell in the brambles, or vie for perches with crows and owls, bending a foot to straighten a fathom?\n\nMoreover, the demeanor of the great worthies is marked by supreme simplicity, their tastes so plain as to seem desolate, yet they are self-sufficient, serene, and unassuming. Few recognize their wisdom, and though the times do not employ them, they feel no distress. Though they may go days without even the humblest grain of porridge, they would not exchange it for the richest feast of injustice. Though their garments may be threadbare, lacking even a full year’s warmth, they would not delight in the white fox fur of a lawless ruler. They alone may loosen their hair, recline at ease, and guard what they possess, refusing to bow or lower their brows to seek what they do not need. They do not associate with those whose virtue is meager but whose rank is high, nor do they befriend those whose names belie their reality. They do not pursue fleeting glory or chase after power, nor do they consort with the cunning or the mighty. They do not engage in trivial debates or vulgar persuasion, nor do they follow those who bow in servility. Outwardly foolish yet inwardly enlightened, their faces may be unwashed yet their conduct pure—profound as the heights of Mount Song, their depths unmeasurable by any scale, vast as the boundless expanse.",

Dwelling at the summit of the Nine Heavens, though impoverished and lowly, they cannot be coerced by threats, nor swayed by profit, no matter how dire their suffering. Their undertakings may be heard of, yet never fully grasped; their grasp may be seen, yet never debated.\n\nThus, those who despise them raise a chorus of scorn and cast sidelong glances, while those who cherish them are few and feeble, offering no aid—like a handful of soil vainly trying to dam a bursting river, or a ladle of water seeking to quench a prairie fire.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Twenty: Clear Discernment**\n\nThe *Baopuzi* said: It is commonly held that those of unmatched martial prowess are fit to be supreme generals, and those well-versed in order and chaos are suited for the throne of the Three and the Nine. Yet Zhang Fei and Guan Yu, each a match for ten thousand men, both lost their heads and brought humiliation to their lord, their severed crowns offered up—were they not lacking in something? Kong Rong, though refined in conduct and surpassing in letters, failed utterly in governance, his downfall lying precisely where he should have excelled. Deng Yu and Ma Yuan were mere scholars from the fields, yet adept in the art of war; Xiao He and Cao Shen never delved into the classics, yet excelled as chief ministers. From this, we see that truly knowing men is no easy task.\n\nIf one insists on testing them before employing them, one fears the tripod may topple and the broth spill. If one relies on words and appearances, one risks mistaking the specious for the true, for falsehood and authenticity are often intertwined. Yet the world deems this an easy matter—merely glancing at a man, they claim to grasp him entirely. I remain deeply skeptical and dare not assent.\n\nTo distinguish the worthy from the unworthy, to perceive the spirit through form—this depends on the man himself. It cannot be forced. Unless one’s clarity rivals the sun and moon, or one’s hearing transcends sound itself, one must proceed with gradual discernment, advancing step by step. One cannot entrust great responsibility all at once, nor lightly lend the sharpest blade, for once given, reclaiming it is exceedingly difficult, and the damage incurred may be great.\n\nShould one’s dimness in one matter guarantee ignorance in all others? Those who resemble me are not necessarily useful, nor are those who differ from me necessarily negligible.\n\nSome may object: Heaven hangs its signs, and earth bears its forms. Gazing at mountains and measuring rivers, one may infer their heights and depths; when winds rise and clouds take flight, one may divine fortune and misfortune. The wise man, seeing a mountain not yet exhausted, perceives the fine jade within; beholding a shore not yet withered, senses the luminous pearl submerged in the deep. When a comet appears, he knows the *zhan* fish is about to die; when the sun and moon are eclipsed, he recognizes the *qilin* locked in combat. The weight of Mount Hua and Mount Tai can be known without scales, just as the unfathomable depths of rivers and seas are fixed without measurement.\n\nThe wings of the swan and the swift hooves of the *lu* steed, though they have not yet flown or run, are surely light and swift. The sword of Hao Cao and the dagger of the Xu clan, though they have not yet struck, will undoubtedly sever with precision. The calf of the brindled ox has the capacity to swallow a bull; the fledgling osprey bears the fierce mien of its kind. Where plants flourish, the soil is rich; where fish grow large, the waters are vast. A tiger’s tail does not attach to a fox’s body, nor does ivory emerge from an elephant’s mouth.\n\nShu Yu’s insatiable greed was evident from his birth; the signs of Shi Wo’s betrayal of our clan were manifest from the moment he opened his womb. When Wu Chen was but a child, Shen Tong foresaw his theft of a wife; Zhang Fu recognized Chen Ping’s future greatness at first glance. Fan Li vanished into the Five Lakes because of Goujian’s wasp-like eyes and bird-like beak; the people of Zhao abandoned their ambitions for conquest because of Bai Qi’s sharp brow and piercing gaze.\n\nKing Wen met Lü Shang beneath the mulberry’s shade, and before the shadow had shifted, knew him worthy of command. Emperor Xuan beheld Zhuge Liang, and before the sundial’s shadow had changed, entrusted him with his heart and mind. Guo Tai, though of middling talent, excelled in knowing men: in Yingchuan, he befriended Li Yuanli; in Chenliu, he allied with Fu Weiming; in Waihuang, he drew close to Han Zizhu; in Puheng, he revered Chou Jizhi; in his school, he gathered Pang Degong; observing the plowman, he discerned Mao Jiqi. He saw that Meng Min, though burdened with a load, would drop it without a second thought, and warned Yuan Ai of his impending ruin—his words proved entirely accurate.\n\nMust one not be able to discern the keen from the dull by their outward signs, judge urgency and composure by their demeanor, gauge brightness and obscurity by their voice and bearing, observe their generosity or stinginess in fitting measure, assess truth and falsehood in their words and deeds, examine their conduct in both public and private, and compare their beginnings and ends with the evidence of their trustworthiness? Is this not an easy task?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replied: I do not claim that men are entirely unknowable, nor that discerning them is without principle. I merely say that this art exists, and that great clarity is required—yet men of the world each presume themselves capable. Thus, I offer these words as a warning to those who would entrust responsibility.\n\nFor a man’s imposing appearance does not guarantee his worth, nor does a frail frame ensure his folly. The roaring man is not necessarily brave, nor is the gentle man necessarily timid. Some may share the same outward form yet differ in intent; others may have distinct natures yet converge in purpose. This is not like the fixed seasons of heaven and earth or the unchanging contours of mountains and rivers.\n\nThings may be distant yet easily known, or near yet difficult to fathom—just as the eye can survey the vast heavens but cannot perceive the nape of one’s own neck, or as the ear can hear thunder yet cannot detect the sound of ants and lice.\n\nTang Lü and Fan Xu were skilled in physiognomy, yet could only discern longevity, poverty, wealth, rank, and status—they could not fathom a man’s temperament, whether broad or narrow, nor the rise and fall of his aspirations and conduct. If even the emperor finds this difficult, how much more so the common man?\n\nYou cite examples of judging by form and challenge me with talk of spirit—yet you have not grasped the root and have strayed from the point. The arrows of the archer who never misses may all pierce the autumn down, yet if he cannot consistently hit the target, he is not truly skilled. Shen, the mother of Shu Xiang, may have had one success, but she could not repeat it. Yao, who studied the ancients, misplaced his trust in Ji; the sagely Duke of Zhou erred in his appointment of Confucius. One may discern the rise and fall of distant omens yet fail to recognize a worthy man standing before him; Yan Shigu could judge purity and impurity across a thousand years yet was blind to the extraordinary talent within arm’s reach. If knowing men is so exceedingly difficult, then even Guo Tai’s judgments must have surpassed those of the sages.\n\nYet his successes were obvious and easily recognized, while his failures went unrecorded. What is truly valuable is to perceive outstanding talent among the nameless, to spot the swift steed on the slopes of Wu, to pluck the pearl-bearing oyster from the ninefold abyss, to point out the luminous jewel amid the piled stones. Like Bo Jie, who recognized the instrument of perfect pitch in the ashes of a fire, or Zhang Heng, who selected the bamboo of exquisite resonance before it was used—amidst the gathering of six armies or the bustle of the marketplace, a single glance should suffice, without confusion, to probe the hidden depths of a man’s heart, to determine his course from beginning to end. This is the untransmitted marvel of true discernment.\n\nIf, as you suggest, one must wait to observe the entirety of a man’s conduct, to witness the beauty or ugliness of his deeds, then it is like weighing silk threads after they have been measured on the scale, or declaring the length of cloth after it has been cut—anyone can do this. Why would the wise need to trouble themselves?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Conduct and Character**\n\nThe *Baopuzi* said: To emulate the all-encompassing embrace of the Mysterious and the Yellow, to illuminate the radiance of the sun and moon, to display the patterns of the Dao and manifest brilliance—this is to surpass the vulgar and the empty. To embody the subtle workings of the spirit while appearing foolish, to never repeat a mistake while seeming obsequious—such is the worthy man.\n\nTo dwell in the tranquility of non-action, to tread the path of integrity and uphold impartiality—such is the man of the Dao.",
      "overlap_context": "ely on a weary nag and seek to follow the tracks of *Zhou Mu*, to wield an axe and hope to match the dual craft of *Ban* and *Mo*, to neglect true talent and yet desire the proper ordering of constant norms—is this not difficult? Though name and reality may leak away in this generation, their virtuous renown may yet be sought by those to come.\n\nRejoice in Heaven and know fate—what is there to fear, what to grieve? Abide in time and follow the natural order—what is there to resent, what to blame?",

They cannot utter a single insight, nor string together half a sentence. In office, they cannot govern the people; in war, they cannot command troops. In administration, affairs collapse; in missions, they bring shame. In action or stillness, they are never fitting; in advancement or retreat, they are never apt. This is the first difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars whose appearance seems unadorned and weary, their bearing coarse and unrefined, their voice and manner subdued. In movement, they are stiff and awkward, yet they harbor hidden brilliance and treasure profound learning. Their conduct is lofty, their abilities surpassing those of the finest ministers; their writings flourish like spring forests. In office, all affairs prosper; in war, they achieve complete victory. This is the second difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars whose strategies are profound, their schemes divine, their wisdom encompassing success and failure, their thoughts penetrating the obscure and mysterious. Their talents are all-encompassing, their abilities suited to the highest affairs. Yet their mouths cannot convey what their hearts hold, nor can their brushes capture their intent. In casual encounters, they appear no different from the ordinary. This is the third difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars who are quick-witted and sharp, their words artful and dazzling, their analogies flowing like a deep spring, their manner forceful. Yet what they speak, they cannot practice. Skilled in recognizing the past, they falter in managing the present. When governing, governance falters; when shepherding the people, the people resent them. This is the fourth difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars whose outward demeanor is reverent, their words and bearing respectful, yet their spirits are slack, their hearts scattered and unrestrained. When entrusted with tasks, they feel no concern; when placed in charge, they bring no order. This is the fifth difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars who can draw a bow to its fullest, shoot arrows through stone, ride backward, stand on tiptoe, and master all five weapons. Yet their bodies are light, their thoughts shallow; their hands are strong, but their hearts are timid. In mock trials, they have no equal, but in real use, they prove ineffective. At the sight of dust from an approaching enemy, they flee in panic; at the sound of the foe, they lose their nerve. This is the sixth difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars whose manner is unyielding and slow, their words few, their appearance plain. Their conduct is flawed, lacking small courage, constrained and cautious. They endure insults without retaliation, like birds with clipped wings and lowered talons. Yet their courage is steadfast, their hearts resolute. They fear no powerful foe, and where righteousness lies, they face death as if returning home. Even if dismembered, they will not alter their resolve. This is the seventh difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars who are filial and fraternal, gentle and kind, their demeanor calm and refined. They walk in trust and think in compliance, never transgressing propriety. In hardship, they remain pure, their integrity as clear as ice and frost. Yet they are slow and impractical, unable to grasp essentials or act on opportunity. Their undertakings yield no success; in their own conduct, they are reckless. When entrusted with tasks, they fail to rise to the occasion. This is the eighth difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars whose conduct is lofty and unconstrained, their character stern and towering. They whistle and strut, disdaining their peers and scorning convention. They are careless in small matters, their faults exceeding reason, acting as if no one else exists. They form cliques to attack and slander, aligning with those who share their failures. Scholars and friends do not follow them, and critics dismiss them. Yet in court, they stand with unyielding integrity, knowing no restraint in their loyalty to their superiors, and governing their subordinates with clarity. This is the ninth difficulty in discernment.\n\nThere are scholars who are generous and broad-minded, humble in receiving others, concealing faults and hiding flaws. They are warm, respectful, incorruptible, diligent, and modest, aiding the endangered and preserving trust. They entrust their lives without doubt, and orphans under their care are secure. Yet though pure and good, they are blind to power; though benevolent, they lack decisiveness. They cannot reward the good or bear to punish the wicked. Their loyalty and integrity are abundant, but their practical abilities are lacking. Like one holding an axe, they hesitate, abandoning laws and indulging wrongs, mixing right and wrong, ultimately leading to failure and defeat. This is the tenth difficulty in discernment.\n\nThings may appear similar yet be fundamentally different, seeming one way yet being another. To judge without confusion, one must perceive both form and spirit—how much more so for those who are not sages? Thus, in employing talent, selecting scholars, fostering closeness, and forming friendships, one cannot but be discerning, cannot but be thorough in testing.\n\nMoreover, the confusion of human nature and conduct may begin upright but end in depravity—like Wang Mang, who at first seemed finer than Yi and Huo, yet in the end was more vicious than Zhao Gao. Such transformations are not something even men of middling talent can fully anticipate.\n\nIf scholars were as easily distinguished as the wren from the swan, the fox and hare from the dragon and qilin, then the Four Fiends would not have gained office in Yao’s court, Guan and Cai would not have nearly endangered the Zhou dynasty, Confucius would not have erred with Zhan Tai, Yanling would not have regretted discarding his gold, Yi Yin would not have labored seventy times, and Xiang Yu would not have regretted dismissing Fan Zeng.\n\nThe trouble lies in the confusion caused by things like *wufu* jade resembling true jade, the *jiaomiao* moth mimicking the phoenix, frozen ice resembling crystal, and smoke resembling misty vapors. Thus, even the wise may err.\n\nHow much more difficult is it for the emperor? And how much more so for those near at hand!",

      "translated_text": "The truly great and luminous mirror, darkly discerning the subtle and spiritually weighing all things, perceives with clarity what lies hidden—gazing upon mountains, it recognizes uncut jade; facing rivers, it knows true pearls. Thus, even amid the most difficult distinctions, it makes no errors of acceptance or rejection. By this means, judgments are rightly divided, praise and blame justly apportioned. Were this so, Wu Ding would not have ruled alone, nor would Fu Yue and Lü Shang have remained long cast aside; Wang Mang and Zai Pi would not have completed their evil, and Gong and Shi Xian would have found no place to conceal their deceit.\n\nSuch is the rough outline of selecting men, the general principle of careful choice—yet the subtleties of seeking the right person cannot be fully captured even by the finest brush.\n\n**Case 21: Quelling Litigation**\nMaster Gu’s nephew, Liu Junshi, argued:\n\nThe human order begins with husband and wife, their union modeled upon the Two Modes. Thus, the great rite of marriage was held in highest esteem by the ancients. To join two families in goodwill and continue the ancestral line, the host bowed in welcome at the gate, received the charge in the temple, presented dark and light silks as gifts, and personally handed the reins to the groom. If the groom was in three years’ mourning, the command was given; the bride’s family assented and dared not alter it. After the great mourning had passed, they sought the groom’s permission; only when he gave his word was the marriage finalized. Such was the reverence for deference.\n\nHow could there be litigation before the wedding feast? Yet in later ages, frivolity and disrespect have harmed customs and corrupted morals. Betrothals are promised but not fulfilled, leading to suits that bring shame and clog the courts. Now, let all who dispute marriage before sharing the wedding meat be deemed to have broken their bond, and let the betrothal gifts—wine, silk, and cloth—be returned. Those who have separated once shall repay double the betrothal gifts; those who have parted thrice shall repay triple. Thus, those who separate will have no cause for litigation, and the greedy will find no profit in delay. This is the essential method of royal governance, an enduring law that cannot be changed.\n\n*Baopuzi* replied:\n\nMaster Liu grieves the decline of virtue and deference and laments how litigation harms the people’s transformation. Though he hastens to end lawsuits within families, the value of harmony is not thereby served. He fears the world will sink into mutual ruin, so he devises bold proposals to salvage what has been lost, offering fine plans to rescue a wayward age. By this means, he seeks to replace shameless customs and transform a clamorous society. Yet distinguishing truth from falsehood is inherently difficult.\n\nTruly, this is an enduring law for governing the state, a most beneficial discourse. Yet Hong, being dull and unversed in the highest principles, in my haste to respond, harbor some doubts.",

      "translated_text": "Marriage bonds are formed by mutual consent without coercion—one party selects with care, the other finds satisfaction and thus grants consent. Light promises later regretted incur blame upon the woman’s family, for breaking faith and abandoning trust, seizing or yielding at whim. Though strict prohibitions and severe regulations are imposed, they cannot fully prevent such transgressions. Now, by allowing the unrestrained to indulge their desires and doubling the betrothal gifts, the poor are deterred, while those of ample wealth may fulfill their wishes. Yet if the later suitor proves wealthy and offers to augment the betrothal gifts, the woman’s family will gladly accept. Thus, the first family must remain silent, unable to voice objection. Examining the matter by its true nature, can they not but sigh in resentment?\n\nThose who defy authority regard death as a return home, and from this, bloodshed will arise. If one merely spares them the minor disgrace of litigation while fostering deep, unbearable grudges, it is like cherishing the trivial cost of rent while forgetting the ruinous toll of decay. When purchasing goods in the marketplace, if one raises the price only to seize them, few will endure such provocation without anger. How much more so when the wife one awaits is taken away? Should this law be enforced, those who marry—though they perform the *naji* rites and the bride’s welcoming—will still harbor the fear of seizure. Why? Because Master Liu’s argument fixes the marriage bond at the *tonglao* ceremony. Thus, even if the woman’s family has accepted betrothal gifts for years, they may still wield arbitrary power, confident they can seize her back multiple times. If the groom is dissatisfied, he may repudiate the match, and enmity will swiftly lead to disaster—nothing is more grievous than this.\n\nIn former times, lawmakers carefully considered the entire process, blocking the path at its outset to prevent the sprouting of trouble. Their foresight was keen and unerring. The system of *baoban* (returning the betrothal gifts as a formal rejection) was likely designed with this in mind. Suppose a woman possesses peerless beauty, a face to topple cities, and a figure beyond compare. If she catches the eye of a powerful minister or nobleman, who, captivated by her allure, forgets propriety and decorum, spares no expense—even offering ten times the betrothal gifts—would he hesitate? The House of Hua did not shrink from killing Kong Fu to take his wife, nor did the men of Chu refrain from seizing the bride intended for their lord when they beheld her beauty. By this reasoning, would they scruple to exhaust their household wealth to aid the woman’s family in repaying the first suitor’s betrothal gifts? Petty men, fickle and quick to take offense, readily nurse grudges. They delight in abandoning the declining and pursuing the ascendant, trampling the cold to chase the warm. If this law is enacted, it will surely lead to the poor and lowly being deprived while the rich and powerful prevail. I wonder, what measures does my lord propose to guard against such abuses?\n\nSome suggest: Let the woman’s family receive the betrothal gifts without regard to amount, but require immediate *baoban* (formal acknowledgment of receipt). Thereafter, have witnesses—no fewer than ten—record their names on a separate document to account for those who may travel afar or die. Further, require the woman’s father, elder brother, or paternal uncle to respond to the groom’s family in their own handwriting. If any breach of promise occurs and the evidence is clear, the woman’s parents and brothers shall all be punished. With penalties so severe, might this not bring an end to litigation?",

      "translated_text": "**Admonition on Wine, Twenty**\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity states: What the eye delights in must not be indulged; what the ear takes pleasure in must not be followed; what the nose favors must not be yielded to; what the mouth craves must not be pursued; what the heart desires must not be gratified. Thus, those ensnared by the eye are surely drawn to wanton beauty and gaudy adornments; those ensnared by the ear are surely captivated by seductive melodies and lewd sounds; those ensnared by the nose are surely allured by the fragrance of *chai* and *hui*; those ensnared by the mouth are surely tempted by rare delicacies and fine viands; those ensnared by the heart are surely lured by power, profit, and renown. When all five senses are thus bewitched, the calamities that follow and the harm they bring to the self—are these not indeed to be believed?\n\nTherefore, the wise restrain their nature with stern discipline, curbing the spirit from recklessly chasing external things. They govern it with tranquility, augment it with foresight, and suppress its passions as firmly as one fortifies a dike against bursting. In guiding their nature, they are more vigilant than one who reins in a galloping steed with rotten bridles. Thus, they preserve longevity within and avoid entanglements without.\n\nHunger and cold are hard to endure, yet those of pure integrity refuse grain and silk obtained through unrighteous means.

      "translated_text": "The near-flavor of wine and sweet liquor is a poison that breeds illness—though it offers not a hair’s worth of benefit, its harm mounts to mountains. The nobleman corrupts his virtue through it; the petty man hastens his guilt. Few who indulge and become infatuated escape calamity. Men of the world know this truth, yet none can wholly abstain, nor even temper their indulgence. They surrender to the immediate desires of heart and mouth, lightly summoning the very source of disaster, like one parched who gorges on cold drink: though it slakes thirst for the moment, it endangers the body.\n\nFrom minor disorder to total ruin, no misfortune is unconnected to wine. Yet the common crowd remains steeped in revelry. At first, their feasts are solemn and dignified: words are few, demeanor composed, songs like the *Yin Zhu* gentle, melodies like those of *Zai Hao* joyous. They raise cups wishing ten thousand years of life, reciting the virtue of temperate restraint. Before the sun has shifted its shadow, limbs grow light, ears tingle. Vessels of glass and conch shells are filled to the brim; penalties for excess are enforced with haste. Drunkenness knows no end, restraint cast aside like a wheel chock tossed into a well. Mouths foam, noses run, heads drip; order dissolves into chaos. They dance wildly, abandon their seats, clamor and shout as if boiling over like a cauldron. Some argue, insisting on victory; others cackle alone; some prattle without reply; others vomit across the mats; still others collapse. The finest entertainers lose their grace, while the virtuous and steadfast glance about warily. The timid mimic the boldness of Qing Ji, the slow and steady whirl like tumbleweeds, the solemn and composed leap like deer and dart like fish. Those once reticent in cold or heat now clap in unison, their voices harmonized. The meek and unassuming become wildly arrogant, their eyes aloft. The decorum of modesty and shame is shattered, and the maladies of recklessness erupt. Base natures are exposed, and the bearing of arrogance emerges. Spirit muddled, essence befouled, judgments overturned.\n\nSome race chariots or gallop horses toward ravines without fear, treating the perilous Nine Bends like an anthill. Others climb heights and stumble, tumbling into the abyss yet unaware, mistaking the depths of Lüliang for a cow’s hoofprint. Some vent their rage on objects, or pour wine for their wives and children. They heap cruelty upon servants, wield sharp blades against possessions, kindle fires in their halls, cast treasures into the depths, and redirect their wrath toward the innocent. They inflict violence upon friends and subordinates. There are those who have slain their lords or been executed by them, who have provoked superiors and suffered humiliation, who have spoken eloquently yet defied reason, bowed and prostrated themselves in vain. Ministers and children breach propriety before their rulers and parents; the lowly and insolent mock their elders. They call candid speech slander and take loyal admonition as personal affronts. Thus, blades are drawn without thought of peril, cudgels swung without regard for what lies ahead. They provoke blood feuds, invite capital punishment.\n\nTo slight one’s elders is to forfeit respect in the village; to insult another’s father or brother is to invite a blade from their sons and brothers. To speak of what others hold taboo is to rouse the wrath of the strong. To exact harsh reckonings is to find no forgiveness even when sober. A moment’s folly breeds lifelong regret, and a hundred ailments fester in the depths. Even a team of galloping steeds cannot outrun past mistakes. Though one may wish to reform, there is no path back. This is what the wise guard against most deeply, yet the foolish cannot escape.\n\nThe litany of its disasters and defeats is beyond enumeration, yet no gathering abandons it. Cups are raised to the ears, regardless of capacity; dregs are measured by the drop, delay deemed slight. They pour from baskets for those they respect, exhausting themselves in vain effort. To refuse is to invite resentment; to urge is to provoke insult. Thus, flushed faces and ugly words arise.\n\nWind piercing the viscera leaves one disoriented; in severe cases, it brings self-injury and self-reproach. All who suffer such illness are filled with dread, swallowing bitterness and enduring pain in hopes of swift recovery. Yet the sickness of drunkenness is no different—why flee the wind in seclusion but fail to curb one’s passion for wine? If one truly feared the wind and loathed illness, the faults of dissipation would cease, and the errors of indulgence would end.\n\nThe harm of wind is treatable, just as the havoc of wine lies in a single breath. Yet in the throes of drunkenness, the mind is thrown into chaos, clinging to existence yet teetering on oblivion. They see Mount Tai as a pellet, the vast sea as a basin. They howl at the sky as if it were falling, cry out to the earth as if it were collapsing. They lie in wait for tigers and wolves, leap into wells and fires without a thought of peril. How, in such a state, can one uphold the rites of reverence, guard against lapses in joy or anger?\n\nOf old, Di Yi warned Yu of the dangers of wine, yet Yu built mounds of lees and pools of liquor. The tyrants Jie and Zhou perished through it. Feng Hou was punished for raising his cup, Jing Sheng ruined by his three ceremonial goblets. Liu Song rotted his bowels with summer’s cooling drink, Guo Zhen lost his mind to daily drunkenness. Xinling’s excess shortened his life, Xiangzi’s debauchery disordered his rule, Zhao Wu lost the people’s favor, Zifan was executed, Han Hui forfeited his mandate, Guan Fu’s clan was annihilated, Chen Zun met his end, Ji Bu was banished, Zijian was dismissed, Xu Miao was silenced—all by this same vice.\n\nThe world delights in it, loves it in great numbers, yet those who warn against it or fear it are few. Outnumbered, how can good counsel prevail? I can only urge the noble to temper their indulgence.\n\nIn years past, during famine when grain was dear, men killed one another in drunkenness. Governors and prefects imposed bans on wine, issuing strict orders and repeated decrees. Officials searched and seized, flogging offenders. Many were shamed, half were beaten to death. The prohibitions grew ever stricter, yet violations multiplied. Some brewed in underground pits, carried wine in oil bladders, or concealed it in their robes. The people’s devotion to drink was profound indeed.\n\nAs a man of humble station, I append these empty words to the end of this book—what can I do? Moreover, those who govern, though they enact laws, cannot themselves renounce this vice. They relax their own restraints while demanding it of others. Without leading by example, how can the people believe? With such teaching, how can it be effective? With such prohibition, how can it be enforced?\n\nThose who sell wine, if they abandon their trade, face hardship. Thus, they adorn their shops, bribe officials, and rely on the powerful. Local authorities dare not intervene. The powerless alone abstain, while the influential monopolize the market, erecting stalls and cornering profits. They double prices, sell openly, and fear no law. When profit outweighs punishment, who can resist?\n\nSome may object: \"The downfalls of Jie and Zhou, the ruin of Xinling and Han Hui—were these solely the fault of wine? Were they not also undone by sensual excess?\"",

      "translated_text": "The claim that Bao Si brought ruin to Zhou and thus rulers should abolish their six palaces, or that the peril of Epang led to Qin’s downfall and thus kings should dwell in thatched huts—such reasoning would have Yao and Shun drinking from a thousand goblets and a hundred cups, and Confucius, who knew no limit to wine, deemed capable. The Duke of Zhou never cleared the meat and wine from his table, yet he established rites and composed music. Emperor Gao of Han reveled in grand drunkenness, yet he slew the serpent and rallied his troops. Yu Gong drank a full *hu* and judged cases with greater clarity. Guan Lu downed three *dou* and spoke with dazzling eloquence. Yang Yun kept wine ever at his lips, and the Supreme Mystery was thereby attained. Ziyu drank until he knew nothing, yet his hegemonic achievements were raised high. A single jar of unstrained wine, poured out, gladdened the three armies. The cup that dispels poison, passed around, moved even the horse-thieves to remorse. Joy was completed, rites were upheld, merit was recognized, and spirits descended to commune with men—without wine, how could these be achieved? Within, it hastens the gathering of uncles; without, it welcomes honored guests. Like the Huai and Mian rivers, its value is prized in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. From this, how can one admonish against it?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* replies: There are indeed tales of wine-flags lingering from the past. It is like the celestial bodies hanging in the sky, their brilliance unmatched—sun and moon, the origins of water and fire, all reside therein. Yet when regulated and deployed, they nurture life and establish merit; when misused, they burn and drown, bringing death. Can one rely on the celestial bodies in the sky and claim water and fire do not kill? The foremost necessity for life is none other than food, yet overindulgence in eating causes stagnation and masses. How much more so with the poison of wine and sweet ale?\n\nHad Jie of Xia, Zhou of Yin, Xinling, and Han Hui not been swept away by the decadent sounds of亡国, nor drowned in the chaos of倾城’s seduction—all fueled by wine’s fumes, their natures inflamed, their power emboldened by drunkenness—they would not have reached such extremes of indulgence, forgetting the arts of self-cultivation. You trace the branches but miss the root; you call it not the disaster of wine, yet from where does disaster arise? It is like knowing muddy rain soils one’s robes but not recognizing the clouds that produced it, or fearing only the dust that stings the eyes while ignoring the gale that drives it. Tales of a thousand goblets and a hundred cups are baseless words, absurd claims—no wise person would believe them.\n\nThe sages’ distinction lies not in their talent or wisdom extending to their physical forms—none were seven *chi* or three *zhang* tall, nor a myriad times larger than others. How could a single day’s hunger bring them to such extremes? Confucius feared the alteration of his nature and dared not descend into disorder. The Duke of Zhou, though he bowed a hundred times a day and left meat and wine untouched, remained ever vigilant, trembling with caution. If even such sages were thus, how can ordinary men avoid regret?\n\nEmperor Gao of Han, responding to heaven and inheriting the mandate, would have slain the serpent even without drunkenness. Yu Gong was astute and clear in his judgments, weighing matters large and small with fairness, never erring in right or wrong. Thus, punishments were not excessive, the world bore no grievances, and the people were content. His heavy drinking did not impede affairs; if one speaks of great drunkenness, it merely rendered him senseless—what loss was there to his talent for resolving doubts? Never have I heard of Gao Yao, Fu Hou, or Zichan deciding cases while drunk.\n\nGuan Lu was young and rarely engaged in weighty discourse, so he borrowed wine’s influence to bolster his courage. Had he exceeded his limit, he would surely have become confused. Yet when he divined the subtle in hexagrams, sought the transformations of gods and demons, observed qi and complexion to determine rise and fall, listened to birdsong to foresee the future, watched wind and clouds to avert misfortune, or read the steles of Huan to discern fortune and calamity—did he require wine to do so? Yang Yun was a man of broad learning, his thoughts lofty, his intellect vast, his endowment from heaven—how could he rely on external things to aid his writings? His frequent drinking was but a passing preference, or perhaps a means to dispel illness through the power of medicine.\n\nZiyu’s ambitions were long set; even without drunkenness, he would have departed all the same. The joy of the three armies at the jar of unstrained wine was a metaphor: if rewards and punishments are just, authority and favor aptly applied, strategies long and short deployed with timeliness and flexibility, then soldiers will act with resolve, and men will gladly risk their lives. Without such, even if wine flowed like a river, how could it decide victory or defeat? Duke Mu of Qin’s drunken pardon of the horse-thieves was a momentary lapse, an abandonment of law that fostered evil—what is there to praise? How does it compare to caution?\n\n*On the Absurdity of Illness*, Chapter Twenty",

      "translated_text": "Bao Puzi said: In the world’s constant flux, ritual and teaching have gradually declined, reverence and deference no longer exalted, while arrogance and rudeness have become the custom. Companions at drinking feasts now squat or sprawl; in the heat of summer, they bare their heads and strip their bodies, their sole concern the games of *chupu*, *tanqi*, and *weiqi*. Their discourse never strays beyond the realm of sensual pleasures, their speech never leaves the company of brocade and fine silk. Their wanderings never depart from the gates of the powerful and the wine-loving, nor do they ever hear words of pure discourse or discussion of the Dao. They take coarse jests and mockery as their first priority, esteeming those who do likewise as lofty and refined, while dismissing those who do not as dull-witted and rustic.\n\nThus, the common rabble and the vulgar crowd admire them as moths drawn to a bright flame, and imitate them as light feathers borne on the whirlwind. Their taunts and jests may target ancestors or descend to wives and daughters. Those who initiate such talk strive to make it as cutting as possible, while those who respond fear their retorts may not be weighty enough. The instigator gives no thought to the consequences of an answer, and the respondent feels shame if his words fail to fully avenge the slight. Like reaping the millet of Zhou or cutting the wheat of Wen, their feuds arise from grievances that cannot be laid to rest.\n\nThose with sharp tongues rely on strength and ally with power; the glib and quick-witted borrow the sting of the *rou* wasp to pierce with the *fen* barb. To fail to respond is deemed clumsy and inferior; to yield first is considered defeat. In such exchanges of enmity, how can one remain silent? Even those of talent and discernment are thus treated by others.",

      "translated_text": "Those skilled in such exchanges rely on circumstances, gauge opportunities, and model their responses on established forms, drawing from antiquity to illustrate the present. Their words are subtle yet reasoned, refined yet amusing, striking the mark without wounding. They avoid what others taboo and do not trespass on what others cherish. As for those who lack such skill—when they speak for others, they distort the straight and force the crooked, leaving their listeners stunned. Whether fair or foul, their words aim only to sever ties, and far from being harmless, they bring only ruin.\n\nThere are those, too, who are quick to anger or of a nature that brooks no offense. Unable to endure, they fling their robes aside, seize thorns, and come to blows. Vile words are hurled at those they once revered; joy turns to enmity, friendships shatter, reputations crumble, and feuds take root. Some hurl cups and goblets; others expose hidden secrets. Of old, Chen Ling was struck by an arrow, and the Guan clan was wiped out—not by fate from heaven, but by the power of words. The pivot of disaster, the arbiter of honor and shame: the warning of the three seals was no deception.\n\nEven thunder cannot retrieve a past mistake; the finest craftsman cannot polish a tarnished word. Though one may not always weigh their words thrice before speaking, a light jest can still quell brewing strife. Honor your speech, respect your bearing—let your words be free of fault, your manner neither haughty nor lax, so that your conduct may be emulated, admired, feared, and loved.

      "translated_text": "Those who fall into unfiliality—can one not scrutinize this? Yet the deluded lack self-awareness, and the willful shun admonitions that grate upon the ear. They loathe virtue and lack the needle of forthrightness to pierce their illusions; they are bewildered by confusion and lack the compass of self-reflection. Flatterers and petty men laugh in approval of what is good, while those who feign compliance clap their hands in praise of merit. Thus the deluded remain unaware of their errors, believing themselves possessed of Yanzi’s caution and surpassing eloquence—unaware that this is but the banner that summons calamity, the tally that invites harm, the post-horse that overturns the body’s carriage. Is this merely a matter of diminishing one’s present reputation or tarnishing one’s posthumous renown? Even with lifelong prudence, one cannot undo a single morning’s transgression; even with the wealth of Tao Zhu, one cannot redeem a single misword. A slip of the tongue strays a thousand li; a wounding word cuts deeper than a sword. Small faults accumulate into glaring ones, shallow lapses deepen into ruin. A goose feather can sink a dragon boat, and many light burdens can break a sturdy axle. A gust of wind can burn a towering hall, and a termite can topple a tree of a hundred spans. Why did the ancients tread so cautiously, while modern men are so reckless and arrogant? Thus men of lofty virtue turn away at the sight of dust, while the frivolous and shallow flock like echoes to a sound, shadows to a form. Those who plot affairs lack the aid of the wise; those in peril find no one to admonish them. Good historians hold their brushes, finding no deeds worth recording; eloquent speakers fall silent, their words unworthy of transmission. No fine reputation endures, while shameful rumors spread without end, leaving behind only ruin for future generations—neither a model to emulate nor a record to preserve. This is the disgrace of the aspiring scholar. To persist in error without correction is to abandon the smooth path and plunge into thorns, to forsake sweet springs and swallow wolfsbane. Is this not the very case of deeming small good as unworthy of pursuit and small evil as harmless to indulge, until evil accumulates beyond concealment and guilt grows beyond absolution?\n\nI urge the people of this world to reform their deceitful ways, to cast off their arrogance and stinginess, to rid themselves of boastful and haughty men, and to cease all mockery and improper speech. Then the gates of Zhao Sheng will not turn away guests, and the cudgel of Huang Zu will find no use.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: Some, lacking pure virtue to command respect, rely on brute force to demand fear. When among others, they stand rigidly, refusing to sit, and vie to occupy the highest seat. They scowl and raise their voices, driving others away to assert their dominance. When displeased, they seethe with resentment and refuse to yield. In narrow paths, they refuse to share the way, striding forward with flailing arms, shoving others into peril. If not immediately avoided, they escalate their aggression. Alas! How far this is from the ancients, who, though humble, were never surpassed—yielding the path, deferring to others, modest and unassuming, standing as if their robes could not bear their weight, walking as if their bodies could not contain themselves. How shamelessly inferior are these men! Those of noble conduct and pure integrity, though they may humble themselves, are still esteemed by others. If one’s conduct is not lofty, even if one acts with arrogance, others will not respect them. If one outwardly adopts human form but inwardly loses humaneness, they will be despised, not revered.\n\nIn former times, when Zhuangzi had not yet dined, the King of Zhao stood at his side; when Zou Yan entered Yan’s borders, the lord of Yan swept the path before him. In Kangcheng’s village, the Xiongnu prostrated themselves in homage; in Linzi’s court, none failed to show reverence—not through force, but through virtue. One who amasses wealth through banditry, though rich, is not worthy of praise; one who coerces others through violence, though feared, is not worthy of honor. Yet the common people engage in such acts without shame. Those who hear their words recoil as if a vulture’s cry has sounded; those who see their faces shrink as if a demon has appeared. Wherever they go, it is as if a monstrous omen has descended; wherever they travel, it is as if a pack of tigers has gathered. Fools emulate them, boasting of their boldness; petty men cite them as the first step toward chaos. Disorder has no fixed cause—this is its origin.\n\nYet those who dare to act thus are not necessarily inherently wicked. Most come from families of rank and influence, or doors of power and patronage. They initially perform good deeds to steal hollow reputations, and once their names are vaguely established, their true natures emerge. Some use wealth and beauty to curry favor with the powerful; others exploit the times to attain frivolous honors. Some marry into noble families, while others manipulate praise and slander to align with authority. Their ambitions swell, their demeanor grows unchecked, and their faults multiply. They form cliques and expand their influence, their aspirations soaring, their conduct beyond reproach. No restraint can curb them, no criticism can strike them. They become flies with the heads of eagles, rats within temple walls—wherever they are not yet present, they wield power and fortune to control others. Those superior to them dare not speak, and if they do, they feign ignorance. Those beneath them dare not voice dissent, and if they do, they cannot suppress it. Just as pests harming grain perish with the first frost, so too do flatterers and villains meet their downfall in stern times. The only recourse for those who would preserve their integrity is to refuse to serve them and to decline to imitate them. But without an axe handle, what can one do?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: The *Book of Songs* praises the *suijiu* bird for its distinction; the rites dictate that men and women should not behave improperly. Without a matchmaker, they do not meet; they do not sit together, exchange words, or share objects; they do not hand things directly to one another. Sisters who marry out do not share seats with their brothers upon returning. Words from outside do not enter the inner chambers, and words from within do not leave. Women do not go beyond the door to send off or welcome guests; when traveling, they cover their faces. On the road, men take the left, women the right—such intimacy is already excessive. Moreover, men do not stay indoors during the day unless ill, and they do not die in a woman’s hands—let alone anyone else’s. In former times, the woman of Lu did not seclude herself deeply enough, leading to the scandal of Yuluo; Kong’s wife did not guard her chamber closely enough, sparking the disaster of Hua Du. Shi Ji’s lack of caution brought shame upon her descendants; Wangsun’s loose speech led to her confinement. Yet today, common women abandon their proper duties and neglect their weaving and spinning. They idle about, forsaking household chores to cultivate social visits, traveling to see relatives by starlight, torches in hand. Their retinues fill the roads—maids, servants, officials, and soldiers mingling like a marketplace. Along the way, they jest and mock, their behavior detestable. Some stay overnight at others’ homes; some venture out at night and return. They amuse themselves at Buddhist temples, watch fishing and hunting, climb heights, gaze upon waters, travel beyond their borders for celebrations and condolences. They ride in open carriages, curtains drawn, traversing cities and towns, drinking and toasting along the road, singing and playing music, each vying to outdo the other. Such improper habits become custom, leading to all manner of impropriety. The source of licentiousness is not urgently addressed. To govern one’s household, one must first set an example for one’s wife. I hope that gentlemen will slightly curb such behavior, ensuring that women have no external affairs—this is how to guard against subtle faults.",

      "translated_text": "The Master Embracing Simplicity said: Frivolous men tread the paths of the lofty and profound, forming bonds through wealth and patronage, and once their rank and position are roughly secured, they turn their backs on ritual and rebel against teaching. Claiming to follow their nature and talent, they refuse to conform to norms, forcing themselves into unbridled abandon. They deem arrogance and lack of restraint as magnanimity, and those who cherish caution and integrity as petty and narrow. Thus, when the year-end drums sound, the idle and dissolute—white-haired dogs and drunken ears—gather in cliques, banding together to roam without discernment. Extraordinary scholars and great Confucians may live just beyond the fence, yet they pay them no heed. Wherever their whims take them, though distant, they must go, hand in hand, sleeve linked to sleeve, to wander and assemble. They enter others’ halls and chambers, gaze upon their women, pointing out flaws and praising beauty, judging ugliness and comeliness. What is the purpose of such behavior?\n\nSome, finding the master of the house unapproachable, gather at the front gate, putting on airs and finery. If their demands are not met, they no longer merely peer and eavesdrop but break down doors, scale walls, and bore through gaps, as if raiders or bandits have arrived. If concubines or maidservants hide but are discovered, they search out secluded spots and drag them forth—how monstrous!\n\nThe gentleman, even in his own home, does not expose his family’s unpreparedness. Upon entering a gate, he raises his voice; ascending the hall, he lowers his gaze. Yet these men barge into others’ homes—what principle justifies this? Nevertheless, rootless and spineless men, eager to follow the crowd, regard those who engage in such behavior as intimate friends and those who refuse as discourteous. They truly believe this is how the world must be. Thus, they clamor and crowd into rooms, gazing upon wives, squeezing onto narrow seats, exchanging cups at close quarters, singing lewd and seductive tunes to stir the passions of the fair, howling and clamoring, jesting and mocking, exhausting every vulgarity and obscenity. They laugh at the great virtues of men, trampling propriety and decorum. Jie’s downfall, Zhou’s ruin, the Zhou’s collapse, and Chen’s destruction all stemmed from a lack of ritual—how much more so for common folk?\n\nSincerity that does not arise from the heart renders repeated oaths futile; when intent is fulfilled and spirit attains its aim, even form and vessel may be forgotten. The gentleman’s bonds are forged through the Dao and virtue, through shared aspirations and kindred spirits, thus becoming pure and enduring. The petty man’s connections are bound by power and profit, sealed by familiarity and disdain, thus turning sweet but ending in ruin. Why must they gather in chambers, display intimacy before wives and concubines, and only then divide affection and closeness?\n\nThe ancients, discerning the crooked paths of licentiousness and blocking the inroads of perversity, were truly wise. Those who cultivate such wisdom are gentlemen; those who turn their backs on it are petty men. Yet when prohibitions are enforced, even the inner palace has men who tunnel through walls; when nets are full of holes, the mulberry groves harbor eloping women. If left unchecked and indulged, it is like unleashing a raging fire upon the Yunmeng Marsh or opening the floodgates of a vast reservoir. Can a towering blaze be extinguished with brooms and dustpans, or a deluge stemmed with a handful of earth?\n\nYet custom and habit persist, and all say: “This is simply what the young lords and nobles of the capital and great cities do.”",

      "translated_text": "I often refute them, saying: The Central States are the very source of ritual—could ritual truly be thus? Such practices arise from decline and disorder, not the customs of a well-ordered age. Even Laozi, paragon of purity and emptiness, dared not indulge his desires, lest they disturb the mind’s clarity. If even a man of Liuxia Hui’s spotless conduct and lofty virtue, after repeated encounters, could not prevent passion from stirring within or desire from showing on his face—how much more so for others? Those of indifferent temperament are rare as one in ten thousand, and those who suppress their feelings are even harder to find. Can such conduct be allowed to grow?\n\nThough impoverished scholars may recognize the harm in these customs, lacking both reputation and influence, how can they correct them? I have often lamented this, earning only the scorn of my peers, who call me rustic and unrefined, unable to adapt to the times. Yet I hold fast to my convictions—why should I abandon what I know to be right for what others deem acceptable? Such sighs are not few, but alas, what can I do? Those already steeped in depravity and sinking into ruin—how could they heed unwelcome truths or turn back from their distant, errant paths?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: Among the common folk, there is a custom of humiliating women—mocking them with vulgar words, demanding insolent replies in crowded gatherings before their own kin. The shame and degradation are unspeakable. Some are pinched and beaten, others bound and hung upside down; drunken guests, unrestrained, inflict injuries so severe that blood flows and limbs are broken. How lamentable!\n\nThe ancients grieved at partings without candlelight, mourned for parents without music. Ritual texts deem marriage shameful to celebrate, not to congratulate. Yet people today cannot even uphold these old traditions. Those who are respected in their villages, whose words carry weight among scholars—should they not sternly correct such behavior? Why follow the current and perpetuate these vile customs?\n\nYet these practices have persisted so long among the people that none recognize their wrongness. Gentle persuasion cannot curb them; only harsh punishments could stop them. Thus, the teachings of Zhou are scorned, and Confucius is slandered. Reckless abandon is hailed as transcending the world. Some seize power through upheaval, others rely on powerful patrons to soar and gather. Then they grow arrogant, boastful, their airs towering, their strides haughty, their gazes distant. They are self-satisfied, looking down on those who lag behind or lose their way—even the truly exceptional are dismissed like weeds.\n\nSome recline on pillows to receive guests; others feign illness to avoid them. They expect scholars to crowd their gates like forests, their carriages to choke the lanes, and call this the mark of nobility—claiming it cannot be otherwise. Yet by the measure of power and rank, the Duke of Zhou was diligent in welcoming guests with utmost courtesy. By the standard of reputation, Confucius was patient and encouraging in teaching. Both took humility and hard work as their duty, never prizing arrogance. But by the late Han, all had changed.\n\nDisheveled and unkempt, some received guests without belts, others sat barefoot with legs splayed. At gatherings of friends or outings for pleasure, none spoke earnestly of self-improvement or the cultivation of virtue. No one discussed the subtleties of the Dao or the essence of its teachings. When they met, they no longer inquired after each other’s well-being or reminisced about separations. Guests would enter shouting for servants; hosts would watch for visitors while calling for their dogs. Those who did not act thus were deemed unworthy of friendship. When feasting together, they squatted like foxes or drank like cattle, competing for food, tearing at meat, grabbing and snatching without restraint. All sense of shame was lost. Those who joined in were praised; those who refused were scorned as inferior. All day, no word of moral principle was spoken; all night, no beneficial admonition was given.\n\nThey misrepresented Laozi and Zhuangzi, prizing reckless abandon over restraint, dismissing minor courtesies as beneath the \"perfected person.\" Unrestrained arrogance was called embodying the Dao. Alas! How pitiful—how sorrowful!\n\nThus, they mocked their kin to entertain guests, exhausted debauchery to forge bonds, and leaned on each other to display affection. Those who stretched their legs were praised as graceful and refined; those of dignified bearing were dismissed as rustic and dull. Those who spoke with authority were called overbearing and rigid; those who answered clearly were accused of rudeness and abruptness. All these frivolous, glib men—though skilled in flattery and quick to form cliques, mutually praising and promoting each other for swift success—were in truth shallow and hollow, like the gourd-vessel metaphor of the Shu people. Their chests held not a single line of classic texts; their knowledge extended no further than wine and meat. They were the \"arrogant and fierce\" who obscure virtue, the \"reckless and greedy\" who covet wealth and gluttony—the \"worthless sons\" described by Zuo Qiuming.\n\nIf asked about the subtle words of the ancient texts, the workings of gods and spirits, the transformations of the myriad things, the wonders of distant lands, the great rites of court and ancestral temples, the ceremonies of suburban sacrifices and grand offerings, the origins of the Three Beginnings and Four Commencements, the principles of yin-yang and the calendar, the regulations of military and state affairs, or the differences and continuities of ancient and modern institutions—they would be stunned, speechless, shifting uncomfortably, at a loss for words. Though inwardly they might sense their ignorance, like facing a wall, they would never admit their shortcomings. Instead, they would forcefully boast: \"Trivial old stories—those are for pedantic scholars who chant over dead texts and grovel in dusty alleys. Such things are beneath us!\"\n\nThey know the harm of ignorance and the value of great scholars; they recognize the errors of their habits and the folly of their ways. Yet they remain deluded, clinging to their old, dissolute ways, for these do not hinder their advancement. If a noble person were to rebuke them with stern words, even those who defy authority and persist in evil would surely be startled, their hearts melting like ice, their faces changing. They would turn and flee—but alas, such a day will never come.\n\n*Baopuzi, Outer Chapters, Scroll 2*\n*(Subcategory: Daoist Works, Baopuzi Inner and Outer Chapters)*",

      "translated_text": "*The Imperial Four Treasuries: Baopuzi Outer Chapters, Scroll 3*\n*By Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty*\n*Chapter 26: \"Mocking Delusion\"*\n\nBaopuzi states: When the turbid and the clear were first sundered, the myriad creatures came to life. Among the feathered kind, some could converse; among the furred tribes, some spoke with wisdom. Gibbons knew the way home, and cranes foresaw the future. Dark birds divined yin and yang, while ants discerned distant springs and streams. Even the tortoise and milfoil could not surpass them, nor could Gan De and Shi Shen outdo them. Yet only humans, lacking propriety, fail to rank among the noble by nature.\n\nIn the earliest times, the people knew no hierarchy. The supreme sages lamented the crudeness of such chaos and pitied the baseness of dwelling in nests and caves. Thus they built beams and roofs to separate from the flocks of birds and beasts, and established rites and ranks to distinguish the gradations of dignity. They taught the people to turn and bow, instructed them in yielding and deference. When standing, they bent like a full vessel; when saluting, they clasped hands like drumsticks striking a drum. They regulated the steps of approach and retreat, the postures of gazing and standing, the manners of facing and responding. The *Three Hundred Rites* served as the dike against excess and deficiency—this was the people’s great concern.\n\nThus, solemnity crowns the *Qu Li*, and a dignified countenance heads the *Five Constants*. When stepping out, one maintains the reverence due to guests; when at leisure, one heeds the caution of solitude. Yan Hui composed his bearing even at nightly ablutions, while Zhong You tied his cap-strings in the face of death. To guard against even momentary lapses into carelessness—this is how to secure peace above and govern the people below. Without this, nothing can suffice.\n\nA person’s possession of propriety is like a fish’s possession of water. Though a fish may briefly survive without water, its withering is inevitable. A person who abandons propriety, though still breathing, has already stepped onto the path of ruin. Lu adhered to the Zhou rites, and no enemy troops invaded; Wei followed Ganku’s example, and raiding armies turned their banners. The state of Chu, though armored in a million men, was mocked for its withered might; Qin, though it seized the passes of Xiao and Han, found no willow groves to break its fall. Was this not the consequence of casting aside the Three Foundations and severing the roots of reverence?\n\nHow much worse in times of ease and indulgence, when chaos endures and the winds of instruction decay? The rites of restraint are discarded, and manners of simplicity are lost. Those who draw near to others now encounter a decline in governance; the common people suffer the collapse of the Dao’s guiding threads. It is like fish leaving the water or nets, or beasts escaping to the open land—trapped without refuge.\n\nSince the onset of turmoil, the forms of things have shifted repeatedly. Hats and shoes, robes and sashes, carriages and implements—all have changed with the sun and moon, never settling into constancy. Now long, now short; now broad, now narrow; now high, now low; now coarse, now fine—their adornments shift without pattern. Those who delight in novelty mimic these changes morning and evening, so that what the capital’s elite favor—great brows and distant temples—is imitated even in distant lands, where half the forehead is shaved.\n\nI, in truth, am but an ordinary man, clumsy at following custom. My attire and possessions cannot keep pace with these endless changes. Where no harm comes from remaining unchanged, I have never altered them. Though I am mocked and pointed at, I pay no heed. Not that I stubbornly defy the crowd—truly, I see no need to change.",

      "translated_text": "The superiority of the Central States in most matters over the lands south of the Yangtze is undeniable, yet not all their ways are without flaw. The noble man, in practicing ritual, does not seek to alter local customs—this is why, when traveling to foreign lands, he does not abandon the laws of his native place. How much less should one, in the very land of one’s parents, discard established practices to forcibly adopt new ones?\n\nIn calligraphy, Wu boasts masters such as Huang Xiang, Liu Zuan, and Cen Boran, while Zhu Jiping stands as a peerless hand of his age—just as the Central States have Zhong Yuanchang, Hu Kongming, Zhang Zhi, and Suo Jing, each excelling in their own style, all possessing ancient forms and fully meeting the demands of their craft. Yet I say: to abandon a long-practiced method and laboriously study the calligraphy of the Central States is still unnecessary—how much more so when it comes to altering one’s speech to imitate another tongue? Failing to achieve the ease of the original and instead earning ridicule for one’s clumsiness—this is like the man who, unable to master the steps of Handan, crawls away in shame. Such folly is but a minor matter.\n\nWorse still are those who, in mourning, mimic the wailing of the Central States, their cries suddenly devoid of genuine sorrow. In ancient times, Zhong Yi and Zhuang Xi never forgot their native accents, and the sages approved. Confucius said of one who has lost a parent: \"It is as if an infant has lost its mother—how could such wailing be mere ordinary sound?\" Better that grief be abundant even if ritual falls short, for weeping is but the venting of sorrow—what does refinement or clumsiness matter? Yet now some polish their tones, which is far from true anguish.\n\nI have also heard that among the elite in deep mourning, some, when ill, consume mineral powders with frequent meals, suspending medication to drink wine as if it were their very lifeblood. When illness grows critical and they cannot endure the cold, they allow curtains, bedding, and cushions to be arranged as they please. Thus, even men of talent and strength among the lowly no longer remain in the mourning hall but retire to separate chambers with high beds, thick quilts, fine food, and strong drink. Some even drink with close companions, draining their cups and tossing them aside until they sink into drunkenness, claiming this is the way of the capital. Is this not lamentable?\n\nIn my own village, the virtuous elders of former times, when facing grave hardship or illness in old age, adhered to ritual: though sackcloth remained upon their bodies, they did not allow grief to destroy them. They ate gruel, their mouths untouched by sweetness. Even the unworthy of later times could not help but look up to them. Yet now, men bring such misfortune upon themselves—how vast is the distance between then and now!\n\nIt is commonly said that those in the Central States who observe mourning are excessively extravagant, but this is not so. I have heard that during the mourning periods of Emperors Xuan, Jing, Wen, and Wu of Jin, all emaciated themselves beyond the prescribed limits and did not follow the Wang clan’s twenty-five-month ritual, instead observing a seven-month mourning period. At the time, all in deep mourning throughout the realm took these four emperors as their model. How is it that people today have not heard of this and falsely slander the refined? Is this not confounding?\n\n*Critique of Arrogance, Twenty-Seven*\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: \"Born into...\"",

      "translated_text": "Those born into esteemed families or raised in positions of blazing influence often do not seek arrogance—yet arrogance comes to them of its own accord. Only those of extraordinary capacity can avoid the excess of self-satisfaction. For when one toils in humility and self-restraint, many gather to support him; when one is haughty, slow, and proud, many swiftly depart. Herein lies the pivot of survival and ruin—how can one fail to weigh it carefully? Is this not a grave delusion?\n\nThere are also those who rise from lowly origins, their caution hardening into display: they hunch their shoulders, shrink their steps, bow deeply, stand sideways, lower their brows, bend their knees, and cling to the powerful. Through connections and maneuvering, they leap ranks out of turn, sprouting wings and shedding their former selves like cicadas molting from the earth. Soon they strut, eyes no longer scanning the ground, their vessels full, their hearts content, regarding others as mere mustard seeds. Some cluster in dense crowds, their pipes and flutes clamorous, guests filling their gates until they no longer receive them. Even among those they once associated with, they may favor a few, though such favor is rarely fully deserved. It is merely that their pursuit was more diligent, their visits more frequent, their gifts and flasks never absent. This is what Mencius called \"loving without respecting—treating them like swine and cattle.\"\n\nYet many claim this is the way of self-respect. The way of self-respect lies in humbling oneself before the lowly to cultivate one’s character—not this. Such behavior is but the corruption of a declining age, a chronic malady of a rotting custom. How tragic that so many partake in it!\n\nAs for those of towering stature and vast capacity, whose bearing is free and whose spirit soars far beyond, who walk alone in solitary grace, content in the ebb and flow of the world—whose spirit ascends beyond the Nine Heavens, whose Dao is complete within, who leave the external world behind, whose hats are tattered, whose shoes are worn, whose belts are frayed—how could they deign to compete with vulgar men for petty advantages, to flatter and fawn for favor, to mimic the fawning sycophants of the imperial gardens, or to buzz like spring cicadas and summer flies? If judged by appearance, they are found wanting in refinement; if measured by worldly standards, their coarse simplicity obscures their profound spirit. People see only their rough exterior and cannot perceive the depth of their essence, attending to the skin but not the heart. Though they hold hidden brilliance and embrace the extraordinary, surpassing their age in every deed, their words could awaken the world to truth, their speech could resolve the confusions of past and present, their wisdom is boundless, and they speak only of the Dao—yet a thatched hut cannot contain their thunderous resonance, nor can a dwarf block the radiance of their sharp blade. Thus, fools mock them as common and dull. Only one like the man of Hanbin could recognize a pearl in a muddy clam; only one who weeps blood could discern a night-glowing jewel in the depths of a dark ravine. The firefly swarms in the mosquito’s brow, the giant roc soars beyond the sky; the minnow dwells in the hoofprint’s water, scorning the leviathan that crosses the sea. Their paths and wisdom do not intersect—how can they align? There is no cause for surprise. Those who resent them cannot remain silent, for they wish that gentlemen in office would not judge others by their arrogance, but instead encourage humility to uphold the celestial order.\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: \"When people today hear of Dai Shuluan or Ruan Sizong defying convention and indulging their eccentricities, they call it magnanimity, failing to measure their own capacities. These men were no peers of the truly proud, yet their imitators now cause chaos: some bare their necks and go hatless, some strip and squat like barbarians, some wash their feet in crowds, some relieve themselves before others, some keep guests waiting while they eat alone, or serve wine only to their favorites. Such behavior belongs to those beyond civilization—it is no delight for those within it.\n\nEven Dai and Ruan, with their talent and learning, suffered for their unchecked eccentricities; their gains never outweighed their losses. Had these two lived with restraint, conducting themselves with reverence and caution, engaging others with earnestness and managing affairs with care, where could they not have gone? How much more so for those far beneath them who emulate their ways—they will hasten their own ruin before the sun sets. How could they not be met with disdain, let alone be esteemed for their purity?\n\nLong ago, when Xishi clutched her chest in pain and lay by the roadside, her beauty and fragrance drew all who saw her to admire her and pity her suffering, lingering in concern. Then a neighboring woman, envying her, feigned illness and collapsed by the path. But her ugliness and foul stench repelled all who passed; they scowled, covered their noses, and hurried away. Today, those without Dai and Ruan’s natural disposition who imitate their arrogance are like that ugly woman, blindly measuring herself against a standard beyond her.\n\nEven emperors treated the Three Elders and Five More Elders with the respect due to teachers, for they led by example in reverence. One who lacks propriety invites deep reproach. He who is slow with others will not honor his own kin. If one wishes to be respected, one must first respect oneself. To neglect good deeds is to become evil; to avoid great matters is to remain small. King Zhou’s tyranny earned him the title of ‘lonely man,’ while Confucius, a mere courtier, was called the ‘uncrowned king.’ Thus, the noble man is not defined by wealth or rank.\n\nNow, to engage in conduct that violates propriety yet resent hearing reproaches of swift death is like carrying a pig and hating others for calling it foul, or wallowing in mud and resenting others for calling it filth. Long ago, Xin You saw men with unbound hair performing sacrifices and knew the Rong would soon flourish. I observe that in the time of Huai and Min, arrogance and rudeness were already common, and later the Qiang and Hu invaded and plundered the capital. Only then did people realize these were the omens of earlier misfortune.\n\nNow, as the realm turns toward peace and renewal, how can we not correct past errors and cultivate the beauty of order? One who enters a pack of tigers and wolves only later appreciates the strength of the swift runner; one who lives in a society where propriety has decayed only then understands the steadfastness of the refined. As the Dao declines and the world retreats, worthy scholars and Confucians should grieve together, strike their hearts in shared lament, and correct these ills. If their strength is insufficient, what then? They should at least maintain their integrity like the bamboo and pine, unchanged through the coldest winter. How can they instead rush to join the mediocre, seeking favor with such men? They stray ever farther from the Way—how grievous this is!\n\nYet some stand firm in their principles, unwavering, not swaying like tumbleweeds to follow the crowd, not altering their elegance to mimic vulgarity. No one can hate them, for all recognize their goodness. But those who expect others to be unlike themselves will despise and reject them. Alas! Is this the way of a declining age? The noble man can remain lofty, upright, and unyielding, unswayed by俗, stirring clear waves to cleanse the murky flow, wielding sharp arrows to pierce the crooked. He may not be accepted in his time, nor gain wealth or rank—but if the heavenly nobility remains within him, he stands alone. Even if he does not succeed, what sorrow or regret could he have?\"",

      "translated_text": "Yet how exhausting it is—to fell the root and patch with tiles, to feed on dregs and dig in mud, to sever one’s feet to fit the shoes, to destroy the square to fit the round! The steadfast man cannot prevent others from hating him, yet the Dao cannot be bent. He cannot prevent others from humiliating him, yet his conduct remains his own. He cannot prevent others from casting him out, yet his integrity cannot be altered. Thus, once his lot is fixed and his resolve set, neither encouragement nor discouragement can sway him; joyful acceptance of Heaven’s decree and knowledge of fate keep sorrow and fear at bay. Though hardship and distress may press upon him, he grows only more steadfast; though adversity and misfortune may assail him, he does not regret. One who can truly devote himself thus—how could he ever drift like grass or duckweed, seeking to force a square peg into a round hole? Would he ever do what ritual discards?\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: I have heard that in the late Han, those without conduct ranked and graded one another. The haughty and arrogant, those who refused to submit to the discipline of the Dao, became the leaders and heroes, the \"four-cornered and eight-reaching\" men. All turned their backs on ritual and teaching, following instead wanton perversity, slandering the upright, and attacking the blameless. Their cliques mouthed foul words and practiced base deeds—all their doings were too shameful to speak of. The ancients spoke of \"understanding and penetrating\" as grasping the Dao and attaining to humaneness and rightness. How could they have meant understanding and penetrating licentiousness and debauchery? Such men are like Robber Zhi, who claimed to possess the Way of the Five Constants. This vulgar corruption of human judgment is more grievous than the coming of bandits and thieves—yet its damage cannot last long, nor is it merely a matter of ruining one’s robes.\n\nAs for the scions of noble houses and those in office, who scorn the laws and appear bareheaded, stripped to the waist, and squatting before guests—having disgraced their heavenly offices, they corrupt the common folk and the young. Some of these men may possess pure and upright natures, or they may be frivolous and vain in reputation, yet they personally engage in such conduct. The common people then take this as the finest way to establish oneself in the world. Those who uphold ritual restraints find it bitter and difficult, and such men are often poor and lowly. Those who indulge in arrogance and abandon find it pleasant and easy, and such men are often eminent and successful. Thus, the vulgar all abandon the former and flock to the latter.\n\nIn the world, some who in youth lacked pure and unsullied conduct later gain wealth and rank through buying office, or perhaps their knowledge suffices to adorn themselves, and their cliques suffice to promote one another. The unprincipled then point to them as proof: \"Those who indulge their passions suffer no hindrance to their brilliance, while those who bind themselves to the Way cannot escape poverty and lowliness.\" Yet they do not know that those who rise to glory do so by luck, and those who suddenly fall do so by misfortune—neither outcome stems from their conduct.\n\nAs for these \"four-cornered and eight-reaching\" men, they cherish those who attach themselves to them. For such followers, putting on shoes is too much—tying their belts is too slow. They enter hand in hand, sleeves linked, ascending the hall and entering the inner chambers. When they go out, their carriages press close; when they guard a pass, they charge straight through. Those who bestow favors receive much; those who make requests are always heard. Their desires are invariably fulfilled; their words are always indulged. When they are in trouble, they are rescued. When they recommend someone, even a lame donkey is priced like a dragon steed. When they slander someone, even a filial son is spoken of as if he were Shang Chen. Thus, the rush of petty men toward them is like breaching a dam a myriad blades high to release pent-up waters, or setting a raging fire to the withered grasses of Yunmeng Marsh.",

      "translated_text": "Desire and ambition, solemn and harmonious, flourish in orderly succession—yet this is like scorching ice to make it burn or piling dry ashes to kindle a blaze.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Hundred Li**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: The Three Ducal Ministers and the Nine Chamberlains sit and discourse on the Dao, while provincial governors and prefects grasp the net’s headrope and lift its mesh. The higher their office, the graver their cares and the more onerous their duties. Of these, none is weightier than the hundred-li magistracy. For it is here that the clamor of exactions and demands converges. If the governor or prefect is worthy but his magistrates and district chiefs are unequal to their tasks, the affairs of state will not be set in order, and the ten thousand mechanisms of government will fall into disarray. The damage wrought will not be confined to a single jurisdiction.\n\nMagistrates and district chiefs ought to be men of the highest caliber—yet they are often inferior to officials of the central ministries. The reason for this is no mystery: it lies in the failure to act with perfect impartiality and the persistence of private favoritism. Some are the sons or younger brothers of the powerful, appointed on the strength of their family’s reputation; others are mediocrities advanced through the intercession of influential patrons. Some are chosen because of long-standing personal ties, others because of kinship or other connections. Though their unfitness is known, they are still appointed. Occasionally, such men may prove competent, but they are far from universally so. The majority are unworthy.\n\nFew are those who strive to prove their worth, diligently adhering to frugality and integrity, laboring day and night in the public service to earn the people’s praise, fearing that their achievements may fall short, ashamed that their patrons’ judgment may have erred. The common run of men, narrow in capacity and limited in aspiration, are driven by greed, seeking only to enrich themselves. They indulge their desires without restraint, commanding with a mere glance or gesture. Local officials, knowing they can rely on their superiors’ support, dare not impeach or censure them. Instead, they fear making enemies and thus suffer their rapacity and cruelty in silence.\n\nHow, then, can the common people avoid suffering and rebellion? When rebellion spreads, they have no choice but to band together as outlaws. A towering hall may be shaken by a breeze no thicker than a hair; a thousand-foot dike may collapse because of a single ant-hole. How can such dangers not be guarded against with the utmost vigilance? How can they not be eradicated at their source?\n\nYet those who wield the scales of office often weigh candidates by their own whims, while those who hold the axe of authority bend the measuring line to favor their own. Since they do not select men for office on the basis of merit, and since those seeking office do not consider their own fitness, governance decays and order unravels. Some officials are muddled, arrogant, and extravagant, oppressing the people; others are harsh, cruel, and tyrannical, provoking resentment and rebellion. Some are dull, withdrawn, and indolent, leaving affairs in chaos; others are careless and negligent, allowing institutions to crumble. Some delight in launching grandiose projects, exhausting the people’s strength; others harbor fugitives and bullies, terrorizing the populace. Some, ignorant of the law, are deceived and obstructed; others, addicted to music, wine, and sensual pleasures, neglect their duties. Some waste their days at weiqi and gambling, abandoning their responsibilities; others hunt and feast, forgetting the people’s affairs. Some, failing to review petitions and lawsuits, throw the judicial system into disarray.\n\nWhen the people can endure no more, they rise as bandits and rebels. Once the outbreak is reported and the culprits are bound in the thornwood stocks, the ruler’s wisdom is impugned, the penal codes multiply, and the people’s suffering deepens. Appointing the wrong man is like harnessing a wooden horse with ornate trappings—how can it gallop to keep pace with the wind? Or like yoking a broken-down nag to a dragon’s chariot—how can it shine with radiance in the celestial thoroughfares?\n\nIf those who hold the reins of state and dispense the sovereign’s commands would but scrutinize the glances of a Liang Yue, ensuring that no lame or inferior steed is mistakenly placed among the fine steeds, and if those who lack self-awareness would fear stumbling mid-journey and thus refuse to harness a broken-down nag to the phoenix’s yoke, what cause would there be to worry that the myriad affairs of state would not flourish? What concern that the four frontiers would not be pacified? The Three Sovereigns would not be so far beyond reach, nor the Five Emperors so difficult to emulate.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Drawing Close to the Obscure**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: When a man of outstanding talent encounters a ruler of great discernment, their bond is as firm as metal and stone before the mulberry and catalpa have even begun to wither. When a man of superior ability meets one of profound insight, their mutual understanding is assured without need of trial. Soaring like a swan borne on a mighty wind, gliding like a dragon ascending through startled clouds—how could such a man be neglected because of lowly station?\n\nIf obscurity and neglect could be dismissed with indifference, then Jiang would not have served the Zhou. If remoteness and humble birth could be justly spurned, then Mao Sheng would not have been honored in Zhao. If long-cultivated conduct alone determined advancement, then Ning Qi would not have risen to prominence in Qi. If high repute and established name alone secured office, then Chen Ping and Han Xin would not have been employed by the Han.\n\nThe wise man looks to the great and overlooks the small; he is neither envious nor grasping. How, then, could he be so petty as to weigh firewood before counting the grains of rice to be cooked? Or discard a jade because of a blemish, or pluck out hairs to search for a mole?\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Weighing the Ages**\n\nSome say: The authors of ancient books were men of great talent and profound thought, and so their writings are abstruse and difficult to understand. Modern writers, by contrast, are shallow in thought and limited in ability, and so their works are plain and easy to grasp. Compared to the obscurity of the ancients, their clarity is like a ditch beside the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, or an anthill beside Mount Song and Mount Tai.\n\nThus, waters that do not issue from Mount Kun cannot swell into mighty currents to flow eastward; books that do not come from men of genius cannot achieve the far-reaching elegance of true literary rhythm.\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity replied: One who is versed only in trivial matters cannot be questioned about the boundless expanse of the nine heavens; one who is confined by narrow conventions cannot be expected to grasp the unique insights of the solitary sage. The men of old were neither spirits nor immortals. Though their physical forms may have been refined in the crucible of time, their spirits live on in the present, and their emotions are revealed in their words. The meaning of their writings can still be discerned.\n\nMoreover, the obscurity of ancient books does not necessarily mean that the ancients deliberately sought to make them difficult to understand. Some of the difficulty arises from changes in language over time, or from differences in regional speech. Others stem from the ravages of war and chaos, the long burial of texts, the decay of bamboo and silk, and the loss of many works. Some texts are fragmentary or incomplete; others have lost entire passages or sentences. Thus, they seem abstruse and profound, though they may not be so in reality.\n\nFurthermore, the *Book of Documents* is a compendium of government affairs, yet it cannot compare in refinement, richness, and splendor to the elegant edicts, military dispatches, and memorials of recent times. The *Book of Songs* is a collection of ornate verse, yet it does not match the vast and resplendent grandeur of the *Shanglin Fu*, *Winged Hunters*, *Two Capitals Rhapsody*, and *Three Capitals Rhapsody*. If this is so, how can the philosophical works of the ancients surpass those of modern authors?\n\nYet the clinging adherents of antiquity, blind and deaf to all else, insist that the ancients’ works are divine and modern writings shallow. They value what is distant and despise what is near—a prejudice of long standing. Thus, a new sword gains value through fraudulent engravings, and a worn-out prescription is treasured because of a forged title. So too, though ancient books are plain and unadorned, vulgar scholars declare them to have fallen from heaven.",

Thus, the rush of petty men toward them is like breaching a dam a myriad blades high to release pent-up waters, or setting a raging fire to the withered grasses of Yunmeng Marsh.",

      "translated_text": "Though modern writings gleam like gold and jade, the common crowd treats them as mere tiles and pebbles. Yet ancient books, though numerous, are not necessarily all excellent—they should be regarded as mountains and abysses for scholars, where those who wield the brush may gather timber, hunt, and fish within them. However, just as the forests of Dong’ou and the groves of Changzhou, though abundant with catalpa and elm, cannot be called the grand splendor of towering halls or the resplendent beauty of ornate chambers; and just as the marshes of Yunmeng and the marshes of Mengzhu, though teeming with fish and game, cannot be deemed the lavish feast of simmering broths or the exquisite flavors of fine delicacies—so too do the ancient *Book of Documents* and *Book of Songs* contain principles of meaning, yet they are difficult to surpass in combined excellence.\n\nConsider scholars: all possess virtue and conduct, yet one may excel in literary arts—this cannot be reduced to a single standard. Or take women: all are of peerless beauty, yet one alone masters a hundred skills—this cannot be conflated as identical. If we compare them: in praising palaces, how do the eulogies of Xisi’s *Luqin* compare to Wang Sheng’s *Rhapsody on the Lingguang*? In depicting hunts, how do the poems *Shutian* and *Luling* compare to Sima Xiangru’s *Rhapsody on the Shanglin*? In extolling sacrifices, how do the hymns *Qingmiao* and *Yunhan* compare to Guo Pu’s florid *Southern Suburban Sacrifice*? In recounting campaigns, how do the compositions *Chuche* and *Liuyue* compare to Chen Lin’s mighty *Martial Army*? From these examples, the truth becomes clear.\n\nIn recent times, Xiahou Zhan and Pan Anren both composed *Elegies on the Departed*, such as *White Blossoms*, *Southern Reeds*, and *Luxuriant Millet*. All eminent scholars and refined talents who appreciate literature agree that the *Three Hundred Poems* of old cannot match the works of these two masters. Moreover, the ancients conducted all affairs with unadorned simplicity, while today, nothing escapes embellishment—such is the natural course of changing times and shifting eras.\n\nFine brocade, though lustrous, is no less durable than a straw raincoat; a painted carriage, though elegant, is no less sturdy than a crude cart. Writing is akin to speech: if, in conversation, one speaks as if separated by the vast distance of Hu and Yue, never to be understood, how can such words instruct or admonish others? If clarity and ease are the measure of eloquence, why should books prize obscurity? Just as boats and carriages replaced wading and walking, and brush and ink supplanted knotted cords, later works that surpass earlier ones in excellence are too numerous to enumerate.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 31: On Reducing Superfluity**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: To pacify superiors and govern the people, nothing surpasses ritual. It weaves the principles of human relations into a comprehensive whole, indeed a meticulous system. Yet why must the rites of capping, marriage, feasting, and archery be so excessively intricate? Though human relationships prize order above all, it suffices to establish distinctions of rank and express reverence—why insist on the endless complexities of ascending and descending, bowing and yielding, kneeling and prostrating?\n\nIn former times, when the realm was at peace and the four quarters untroubled, men of antiquity might occasionally practice such rites. Yet officials would spend months lecturing and testing, enforcing discipline with whips and rods, compelling day and night study at the cost of sleep and meals. After long training, they would be examined for a single day: scroll in hand, they performed the rites, following the text in every gesture. Errors brought demotion or punishment, yet still they faltered, failing to grasp the essence. To make such rites the constant practice of the people would be nearly impossible—just as Mozi said, \"Even after generations of study, one cannot master them; in a single year, one cannot perform them correctly.\"\n\nThe ancients sought counsel from woodcutters and gleaners, heeded the songs of children and the words of madmen, yet still exercised discernment. Mozi’s critiques cannot be entirely dismissed, but his emphasis on penal laws and shortcuts, while addressing practical matters, fails to fully expound the kingly Way. Yet his objections to lavish burials and excessive mourning rites are not without merit.\n\nSince the Jian’an era, the Wei dynasty’s regulations for funerals and mourning have emphasized frugality—here, Mozi’s principles find application. I believe that now, with the chaos of war settled and the realm at peace, the ruler should commission scholars of profound learning and broad knowledge, men capable of adapting and refining without being shackled by foolish conservatism, to revise the *Three Ritual Classics*. They should excise what is unnecessary, trace the origins and evolution of rites, consolidate their essentials, and compile them into a coherent system. Where redundancies, obscure phrases, or divergent expressions convey the same meaning, retain only what is practical and discard what cannot be regularly observed without loss. In the end, the rites should be concise and clear, free from obscurity or stagnation.\n\nFor ceremonial vessels—plates, stands, goblets, and chalices—as well as attire, carriages, banners, colors, palace architecture, distinctions of rank, court audiences, guest-host protocols, funeral and burial rites, suburban sacrifices, ancestral temple ceremonies, and rituals for the altars of soil and grain and the mountains and rivers—all may be simplified to ensure frugality. For frugality eases compliance, reduces expenditure, and minimizes errors in practice. Reduced costs spare the people from harsh levies, while simplicity prevents officials from making mistakes.\n\nThe gestures of bowing, yielding, ascending, and descending should suffice to convey meaning without descending into petty details. Each category should be distinct yet easy to reference. The present *Five Rituals* are a tangled mess of overlapping, contradictory, and redundant elements, their branches and leaves scattered, their repetitions and cross-references multiplying. Even diligent scholars struggle to navigate them, their doubts and objections growing endlessly, their differences unresolved. With each passing year, the confusion deepens, and none but the most discerning avoid bewilderment, hesitation at the crossroads, or exhaustion in the thicket of doubts. They toil and strain, comparing and collating, yet often spend years without resolution, their efforts leaving no room for doubt, their groans and sighs echoing as they dissect and analyze. Their hair turns white in pursuit of such refinements, their days wasted, other pursuits abandoned. The young grow weary and disheartened—truly, the harm is endless.\n\nThe commentaries and exegeses sprawl beyond the original texts. If we were to break them apart, merge them with common practices, organize them by category, and prune the excess, preserving only the essential framework and clarifying the precepts, the result would shine as brightly as the sun and moon, as vivid as the five fixed colors. Scholars would find their labor reduced a thousandfold, and the disputes of pedantic Confucians would cease. Future generations, looking back, would praise our age as we now praise the Zhou.\n\nThis is no different from abandoning stone-boiling or blood sacrifices—there is nothing to fear in such change, no regret in discarding the old, no reluctance like that of pushing a cart or leaving a nest. Yet those who cling to convention, upon hearing these words, will surely stare in shock, calling me a madman.\n\nThe Three Kings did not follow the same music, nor did the Five Emperors inherit the same rites, yet all succeeded in transforming customs, pacifying superiors, and governing the people. Whether they reformed or preserved, added or subtracted, all achieved the same good ends. Why must one ride a boat to climb a mountain, a horse to cross a river, wear armor in the ancestral temple, or don heavy furs in the height of summer?\n\nIf ancient practices must never change, then coffins should not replace firewood, and burial garments should not replace nakedness.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 32: On Valuing the Broad**\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity said: The orthodox classics are the deep seas of the Dao and virtue; the subsidiary texts are the rivers that deepen them. Look up, and they are the bright stars that aid the three luminaries; look down, and they are the thickets that embellish the towering peaks. Though their paths differ, all lead to moral advancement; though difficult to embark upon, all converge in cultivating transformation. Thus, the learned trace the roots to encompass the branches, grasp the guiding principles to attain the ends.\n\nThe ancients lamented the scarcity of talent, saying that worthy successors appear but once in a hundred generations. They did not discard the night-shining gem because it was not from Kunlun, nor did they reject instructive words because they did not come from sages. Thus, even the clumsy poems of village alleys or the crude oaths of military camps—though their language was coarse and their analogies vulgar, though they filled no more than ten slips—were still recorded and arranged. The minor sayings of the Hundred Schools align with the classics, just as different vessels, though varied, all serve to extinguish fires, and different medical techniques, though distinct, all cure illness.\n\nSince the Han and Wei dynasties, the profusion of writings has grown ever greater. Though their meanings plumb the depths of the mysterious abyss and their words surge like waves, their influence can summon auspicious omens from the heavens, evoke blessings from the earth, call ring-necked pheasants from beyond the wilds, and secure the realm within the four seas. Near at hand, they quell the roots of disaster; far off, they bequeath blessings for ages to come. Yet the age lacks sages to assess and order them, so they cannot gallop like fine steeds across a thousand *li* or be appended to the *Three Canons* of antiquity.\n\nThe narrow-minded, shackled by their shallow learning, remain trapped in the trivia of philology, dismissing the extraordinary as worthless. Some call them \"minor arts\" unworthy of study; others claim that breadth confuses the mind. Yet they fail to see that a mountain is made of grains of dust, that a hundred or a thousand can sum to millions or billions. Many colors combine to form the splendor of imperial robes; many sounds blend into the harmony of the *Shao* and *Hu* music.\n\nSome prize the shallow, trivial verses of poetry and rhapsodies while scorning the profound, rich, and expansive subsidiary texts. They dismiss incisive and essential words as dull and clumsy, and praise flashy, trivial eloquence as refined and skillful. Truth and falsehood are inverted, jade and stone mixed together—like equating grand music with rustic tunes, or dragon-patterned brocade with coarse hemp. Alas, how lamentable and regrettable that all drift along in this delusion!",

      "translated_text": "Some argue: \"Though writings may be abundant, they merely polish words and dazzle with ornament—what bearing do they have on gain or loss? Far better is the silent instruction of virtue and conduct. Thus, Yan and Min stand foremost, while Fang and Xia rank next in the fourfold classification. Learning is the root, conduct the branch. Then is not literary composition a mere secondary pursuit? Yet you, sir, do not exalt its source but prize only its flow—is this right?\"\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity replies: \"Virtue and conduct are matters of action, their excellence or inferiority easy to discern; literary composition is subtle in form, its essence difficult to grasp. What is easy to see is coarse; what is difficult to know is refined. Precisely because it is coarse, its assessment has fixed standards; precisely because it is refined, its appraisal resists uniformity. Is it not fitting, then, to set aside the easily seen coarse and discuss the hard-to-know refined?\"\n\nAnother objects: \"Virtue and conduct are the root; literature is the branch. Thus, in the sequence of the four categories, writing does not occupy the highest place. Then are not all writings but the dregs of secondary matters, like straw dogs after sacrifice, their high or low rank plain to see? Might I hear of the essential nature of literature?\"\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity replies: \"One may discard the fish-trap once the fish is caught, but until the Dao is realized, one cannot do without the trap. One may abandon writing once the Way is practiced, but until the Way is enacted, one cannot do without writing. Consider the vast or constrained scope of brushstrokes and tonal patterns, the density or sparsity of phrasing and allusions, the length or brevity of sources and ultimate attainment, the depth or shallowness of implicit borrowing and explicit citation—how immeasurably distant they are! Even the space beyond the heavens or the tip of a hair cannot convey their remoteness. How they vie with one another! Even the radiance of the Three Luminaries cannot compare to their magnitude or minuteness. The sharpness of Dragon Abyss swords or the dullness of lead ingots cannot match their keenness or bluntness. The lightness of swan feathers or the weight of piled gold cannot equal their levity or gravity. Clear and turbid, uneven and aligned, each bears its own master; bright and dim, they differ in kind; strong and weak, each follows its own qi. Yet vulgar scholars, seeing only those who can dip brush and compose, lump them all together as one. This is why Bo Ya forever longed for Zhong Ziqi, and why the man of Ying desisted from wielding his axe. For those who carve and chisel may stand shoulder to shoulder, yet Ban and Di alone bear the title of unmatched craftsmen; those who pluck the zither may be legion, yet only Ziqi grasps the difficulty of true attunement. A thousand steeds may fill the stables, yet only Qiji commands a price beyond measure; ten thousand beauties may be counted, yet only Mao Qiang and Xi Shi possess transcendent allure. Truly, there are those who far surpass the multitude.\n\nMoreover, to compare literature with virtue and conduct is like comparing ten feet to one zhang—yet to call it a secondary matter is unheard of. The celestial bodies that hang in the heavens, the praise accorded to Yao and Shun, the resplendent majesty of the noble man, the flourishing brilliance of the dawn, the posthumous titles bestowed upon sages—all from a single word—were these not all matters of wen? The Eight Trigrams gave rise to the adornments of the simurgh; the Six Jia emerged from the burden of the sacred tortoise. Where wen resides, even the lowly become noble—how can the hide of dogs and sheep compare?\n\nFurthermore, the root need not always be weighty, nor the branch invariably slight. Silk brocade relies on plain cloth; pearls and jade reside in oyster and stone. Clouds and rain arise from a handspan; rivers and seas begin with a foot. Thus, though literature ranks after virtue and conduct, it cannot be called a secondary matter.\"\n\nAnother asks: \"The deeds of the present age often fall short of antiquity, and its writings and compositions are likewise inferior. Is this the natural principle of a declining qi and fortune?\"\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity replies: \"Though the hundred schools' words may arise in succession, they all stem from the thoughts of great scholars and the hands of accomplished talents. Compared to the ancients, they need not all be inferior. Some possess vast, profound, and boundless depths, harmonizing with the ineffable. Their inner sources are unfathomable; their outward flow, inexhaustible. They trace their lineage to the long and expand upon the subtle, their wondrous transformations unbound by the square or circle of fixed rules, their lateral connections unobstructed by the constriction of a single path. Thus, those who favor only sour or salty cannot know their flavor; those whose thoughts are limited cannot grasp their spirit.\n\nThe soaring dragon ascends unhurriedly, gazing back as it scales the clouds; the swift steed strides slowly, breathing as it covers a thousand li. Yet the ant marvels at its stairless ascent, and the sluggish nag resents its gradual surpassing. If one gallops through the midst of poetry and discourse, circling within the bounds of commentaries and records, judging the extraordinary with common sentiment, measuring the boundless with a narrow gauge, seeking the utmost refinement with the crudest tools, or probing the profoundest depths with the shallowest wits—even from childhood to hoary age, one will not attain it.\n\nThose who delight in swiftness will praise it as fine, while those who fail to comprehend will condemn it as foul—such is the natural principle. Thus, what they do not understand, they dismiss as empty and absurd, and though they may revere it out of respect, they do not truly believe it, thereby harming others without intent.\n\nMoreover,世俗 generally venerates antiquity and disdains the present. Though there be steeds that chase the wind, they say they do not match the chariots of Zaofu; though there be treasures worth cities, they say they do not equal the tears of the man of Chu; though there be swords that cleave metal, they say they do not rival the forging of Ou Yezi; though there be medicines that revive the dead, they say they do not compare to the compounds of Bian Que and Hua Tuo; though there be men who surpass the multitude, they say they do not match those recorded in bamboo and silk; though there be books that benefit the age, they say they do not equal the writings left by former generations. Thus, Confucius was not esteemed in his own time, and the *Great Mystery* was scorned by his contemporaries.\n\nVulgar scholars often say: 'Today’s mountains do not match the height of ancient mountains; today’s seas do not match the breadth of ancient seas; today’s sun does not match the brilliance of the ancient sun; today’s moon does not match the clarity of the ancient moon.' How could they ever admit that today’s talents do not fall short of ancient bones? To value what is heard and belittle what is seen is a malady not of this age alone.\n\nIn former times, those who smashed lutes and burned texts surely had their reasons. Such is the thirty-third fault of the Han.\"",

      "translated_text": "Bao Puzi said: Surveying the records of former ages, I find no period where the moral defenses of the Dao and the corruptions of custom were more severe than at the end of the Han. Those who held the reins of power—eunuchs and their ilk—grasped the divine regalia and wielded the state’s authority. They deposed the upright and promoted the perverse, harmed the virtuous and indulged their whims. They whispered in secret, turned their backs on those they hated, feigned deafness to truth, and followed the deluded. Kindred evils banded together, drawing in wicked factions, amassing wealth without limit, yet unwilling to disperse even the smallest coin to relieve the destitute and impoverished.\n\nPromotion in office was unattainable without great wealth; justice in litigation was denied without lavish bribes. Though their power and influence were vast, they could not utter even a single word to advance the most eminent talents of the age. Their appointments never extended beyond the relatives of wives and concubines; their favors never reached beyond the circle of their closest attendants. They heeded not the censure of Zang Wen, nor followed the righteous example of Jie Hu’s impartiality. They distributed emoluments to mimic Wang Lin and pursued affairs like the wandering Fang Hui. Thus, men like Liezi filled the streets, yet none received the succor of Zheng Yang; lofty spirits gathered in numbers, yet none encountered the recommendation of Bao Sheng. Independent minds were suppressed, while those who flattered and attached themselves were advanced. This is why Fan Ju covered his mouth in silence, and Feng Tang sighed without end.\n\nAt that time, the prevailing custom was to consume without labor, to conceal one’s virtue, to obscure the worthy, to envy merit and resent it, to slander the pure and white, to shun forthright loyalty and entrap it, to detest those who stood alone and cast them out. The pliant and obsequious were cherished and protected; the upright and unyielding were reviled and abandoned. They nurtured wolves and leopards while slaughtering unicorns and lynxes; they cultivated brambles and thorns while cutting down pepper and cassia.\n\nThus, those who were proud and unrestrained, rolling like pellets or drifting like duckweed, were called magnanimous and great of spirit. Those who were petty, harsh, and treacherous, harboring venom like scorpions, were called just and upright. Those who were glib, clever, and quick-witted, with sharp tongues and petty eloquence, were called refined and discerning. Those who were abrupt, provocative, arrogant, and reckless were called towering and extraordinary. Those who indulged in wine and women, dissolute and shameless, were called untrammeled and unfeigned. Those who sought without restraint, took without scruple, and seized what was not theirs were called lofty and unconstrained. Those with disheveled hair and coarse garments, who roamed and gathered without propriety, were called broadly learned and universally loving. Those who defied the classics, perverted the sages, and parroted heterodoxy were called disciples of Zhuangzi and Laozi. Those who mocked the refined, ridiculed the elegant, bullied their superiors, and treated them with contempt were called free-spirited and refined. Those who destroyed their integrity to conform, who echoed others like an echo, were called unparalleled talents. Those who relied on the powerful, hoarded wealth, and monopolized goods were called masters of adaptability. Those who shirked paperwork and sought empty reputations were called men of great enterprise and lofty ambition. Those who depended on powerful relatives and held positions beyond their ability were called heroic peers. Those who bribed influential families to purchase titles and ranks were called generous and noble. Those who formed cliques for mutual praise, whose deeds contradicted their words, were called cultured friends. Those who practiced heterodox arts and sorcery, invoking ghosts and spirits, were called spiritually attuned sages. Those who practiced divination, deceitfully predicting fortune and misfortune, were called seers of past and future.\n\nThose who excelled in horsemanship and spearplay, possessing the bravery of a single warrior, were called generals of strategic brilliance. Those who abandoned the Dao and virtue, merely echoing the vulgar, were called heroic talents and great scholars. As for those of steadfast integrity and lofty conduct, whose spirits were pure and dispositions vast, who did not ingratiate themselves with smiles nor bend their words to deceive, who bore frost and trod snow without compromising their principles, who upheld the Dao and adhered to rectitude, standing aloof and unyielding—though the wind raged, their branches did not bend; though their bodies were distressed, their resolve did not waver—advancing, they spoke with incisive words and forthright counsel, attacking faults and admonishing shortcomings; retreating, they were sincere and selfless, acting without reservation—these were called dull and benighted.\n\nYet those who rose early and retired late, who diminished their meals to serve the public, who toiled and exerted themselves in governance, were called petty functionaries and vulgar officials. Thus, the wise and perspicacious concealed their brilliance, feigning obscurity; the noble and outstanding remained silent, pretending foolishness. The lowly and humble soared to choose their trees; the constrained and bound conformed, serving as \"court recluses.\" The wise refused to reveal their secrets; the brave did not display their resolve. Loyal and forthright men found retreat difficult; the wicked and treacherous prevailed. The tide of perversity surged unchecked; false paths spread unobstructed.

      "translated_text": "Where superiors were overawed and inferiors neglected, thieves and bandits proliferated. Eunuchs usurped the sovereign’s authority, and the lives of the Three and Nine were held in the hands of mediocre underlings. Loyal and eminent scholars were branded as partisans, imprisoned, executed, or eradicated. The realm groaned in anguish—innocent and blameless men shut their doors only to meet disaster. A wisp of smoke rose from behind the palace screen, and a whirlwind’s conflagration swept through the cosmos. A hairline fissure opened in the skin, and waves surged to the four extremities. The golden fortress was overrun by common brigands; the boiling moat was crossed by a single reed. The keen and sharp melted away at the sight of dust; conscripted soldiers turned their weapons and fled. Flying blades assailed the inner chambers; barbarian robes were looted from the imperial precincts. Millet and sorghum sprouted in the ancestral halls; brambles and weeds flourished upon the jade steps. Cloud-capped towers became dens for foxes and hares; the ceremonial gates of state were trodden into paths for tigers and leopards. The eastern academy was reduced to ashes; the common people were scorched and drowned in the fires of the abyss. The wicked harmed their houses and ruined their states, yet their crimes were inscribed on bamboo and silk. No eulogy came from the upright historian; no virtuous renown was carved in metal or stone. What was the cause? The loss of men.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Loss of Wu**\nMaster Baopu said: The final years of Wu, though separated by eras, suffered the same maladies as before. Having failed in that time, they could not correct themselves in this; though the lessons of chaos and collapse were not distant, they trod the ruts of overturned chariots. Witnessing the scramble for the crossroads, they forgot the disasters that befell them; laughing at the complacency of lice in quietude, they did not perceive that circumstances had changed and calamities were equal. They saw the boats competing to cross sink, yet did not realize that though the paths differed, the drowning was the same.\n\nI was born in the Jin era and did not witness these events, but my teacher, Master Zheng, recounted them in full from personal experience. He often instructed me, saying: The late years of Wu suffered from maladies even more severe. The worthy were not employed; the dregs filled the ranks. The framework of governance collapsed into disorder; laws that could swallow boats leaked everywhere. In tribute and selection, those who offered heavy bribes took precedence; in official appointments, those with powerful factions were favored. Without wealth or influence, one might toil for years without hope. Those of pure virtue and lofty conduct harbored their brilliance in obscurity; those with talent and strength trod the path to the clouds, ascending through office. The ruler was benighted above; ministers deceived below. Without faction, one could not compete; without advancement, one turned against the public good. The customs of betraying the common weal grew ever more severe; the Way of integrity and uprightness was utterly ruined. Thus, the sparrow, startled by the wind, soared to the clouds; the rotting boat, trusting in swift waves, raced like lightning. The phoenix furled its six pinions among thorns; the prow of the yacht stagnated in stagnant waters, its oars unmoved.\n\nThe aides who held the reins and the officials who shepherded the people were either relatives of the empress dowager or flatterers. In office, they offered no loyal counsel to correct errors or supply omissions; in retirement, they lacked the competence to hear lawsuits. In empty talk, their mouths spewed frost and snow; in conduct, they clung to filth and dregs. They wove webs of slander and praise, wielding power and fortune in place of farming. Their carriages and robes gleamed so brightly they could be used as mirrors; their mansions were so grand that flocks of crows perched upon them. Their shouts were swifter than thunder; their blessings and curses faster than spirits. Their influence and profit toppled commanderies; their stores and accumulations enriched the public treasury. When they went out, they were attended by the guards of Di and Huang; when they entered, they strolled among the carved beams of jade. Their retinues formed armies; their gates became markets. Oxen and sheep covered the plains and lowlands; ponds and fields spread for a thousand *li*. Yet outwardly, they feigned the frugality of Yu Qingping and Zhongshu, while inwardly, they emulated the vigilance of Tao Kan and Wen Xin. In truth, they were as corrupt as Anchang, Dong, and Deng. Though they might receive guests, they did not extend the courtesy due even to distant relatives. Starving scholars received not a single measure of grain, yet their halls overflowed with gold and jade, their chambers teemed with singing girls and concubines. A thousand merchant ships rotted with grain; ten thousand granaries brimmed with stores. Their gardens and parks rivaled the Shanglin; their mansions usurped the Taiye. Meat and grain were left to rot for dogs and horses; treasures overflowed their vaults.\n\nIn their dealings with scholars, they showed no kinship, however distant; in their own indulgence, they exhausted every luxury. Some never opened the books of laws and ordinances yet occupied the seat of the Grand Judge; others did not know where their desks were placed yet held pivotal posts. They were ignorant of the names of the Five Classics yet enjoyed the emoluments of Confucian offices; they could not distinguish the cold and heat of a foot-long ruler yet sat in the halls of composition. Their brushes were not reckless, yet they coveted the glory of debate; they lowered their brows and drooped their wings, yet filled the ranks of impeachment. They could not discern the fine or coarse among men yet were entrusted with the governance of appraisal. Ignorant of the military might of the Three Powers, they suddenly found themselves beneath the canopy of authority. Repeatedly, they suffered the shame of routs, yet as generals, they did not lose the glory of the vanguard. Unable to distinguish the difference between beans and wheat, they were sold the near office of imperial counselor. Men of fish-like substance and dragon-like pattern—seemingly fitting yet fundamentally flawed—rejoiced when placed in water but grieved at the sight of a heron. Though threatened with axes and halberds, enticed with the treasures of a fallen city, they could not spur their leaden blades against rhinoceroses or gallop their lame nags to chase the wind. Not that they did not fear severe punishment, nor that they did not desire fine rewards—it was simply that their talents were unequal to the task. What could be done? To entrust them with the illumination of the hundred offices and the harmonious management of great affairs was like placing ten thousand *jun* upon a crimson boat, or seeking a thousand *zhong* in a single *sheng*. To tether straw dogs and demand the prowess of hawks and magpies, or to leash chickens and ducks and expect the soaring might of eagles—such futility was all too clear.\n\nThe lords of Wu did not reflect upon this. They did not add vigilance to their evenings, nor did they employ the flattering and mediocre with heavy responsibilities. The signs of peril and imminent collapse were as evident as the sun and moon, yet they deemed themselves as secure as towering mountains, aspiring to the heights of Yao and Shun. Their eyes were wearied by the dazzle of brocade, yet they did not use this to verify the right and wrong of remonstrance. Silks and grains were squandered on the unworthy, yet they did not use them to relieve the hunger and cold of their soldiers. Their hearts were delighted by flattery, yet they did not use this to contemplate the principles of survival and ruin. They treated the source of rise and fall with levity and neglected the weight of the ancestral temples.",

      "translated_text": "The Master Zheng further spoke of his teacher, Master Zuo, who lived in reclusion on Mount Tianzhu, neither seeking official emolument nor befriending the feudal lords. Yet his heart yearned for great peace and grieved for his homeland. Thus, he sighed deeply beneath his thatched roof and said to his disciples:\n\n\"The vermilion talisman lies dormant, the yellow essence stirs anew; the pivotal axis is restored at the Supreme Culmen, the purple canopy turns back to the Quail’s Head. To succeed Heaven and govern all things, to illuminate the eastern lands of Xia—let the benevolent breeze spread beyond the borders, let the profound grace fill the cosmos. Tongues of distant tribes press close at court, their tribute of coarse reeds filling the halls. Vast and towering, it reaches above and below, a realm of universal peace.\n\nYet this order is easily sustained, yet the Five Constants lie silent, the *Nanfeng* hymn unchanted. Above, the Way of ‘guarding oneself’ is unattained; below, the song of ‘O how prosperous!’ goes unheard. Flying dragons soar but do not alight; deep-dwelling dragons coil but do not leap. The *zouyu* hides in obscurity; the vermilion blossoms sprout but do not bloom. Yin and yang clash in disharmony; cold and heat transgress their seasons. The Seven Governors warn of peril; mountains and valleys shift their places. Thunder rumbles ominously in the month of the dragon’s seclusion; hoarfrost descends with killing force in the season of summer’s glory. The earth’s torch does not shine; sweet springs do not well forth. Ramparts rise on the frontiers; fine grain does not ripen. What else could be the cause?\n\nTruly, it stems from the Four Perils unremoved, the primal and harmonious not promoted. The employed are unworthy; the worthy are unemployed.\n\nYet the lofty, in their vast forbearance, hold jade within and guard purity of purpose, desireless amid worldly things. Concealing their talents in profound obscurity, they find contentment in obscurity, forsaking the world. Not acting against propriety, not appearing out of season, they endure hardship without distress, poverty without regret. Rejoicing in Heaven’s decree, they merge honor and disgrace, advancing without delight, retreating without sorrow. Such men would rather die in obscurity by their earthen windows—how could they deign to display their priceless treasures to vie with the sale of mere swallow stones?\n\nThe Ways of Confucius and Mozi once went unheeded; Meng Ke and Yang Xiong likewise faced adversity. That virtue goes unrewarded in its time is nothing new. The world lacks the keen-eyed Li Zhu to distinguish black from white; the era wants the swift Guan Qing, its fine steeds broken and bent.\"",

      "translated_text": "Amidst golden coffers lie heaps of worthless gravel, while jades and precious stones are cast aside in ditches and canals. Master Carpenter Shi passes them by in distant oblivion; catalpa and elm go unrecognized. Alas! My time is ill-fated—neither early nor late—soon to witness the land of Wu transformed into Jin’s city walls, its southern folk turned into northern subjects. These words still ring in the ear, and Ge Hong of *Baopuzi* says: “The words of these two gentlemen may serve as a warning for posterity.” Thus I record them here, that future generations may know the fall of Wu was not sent down from Heaven.\n\nIf one were to conceal a state’s ills and refuse even the slightest censure, then Dong Hu’s straight brush would be of no value, and Jia Yi would be mocked for his *Faults of Qin*. **Guarding Obscurity, Thirty-Five**\n\n*Baopuzi* says: Among my friends there is a gentleman who dwells in reclusion, admiring the unclaimed land of Qinshui. He chose a secluded plot to build his home, sharpening his skill in the literary arts while neglecting the plow. Year after year, his harvests fail, and hunger shows in his face. Someone once challenged him, saying: “Understanding ritual begins with a full granary; generosity flows from abundance. Prosperity arises from surplus, while frugality stems from want. The *Poet* praises the ten thousand measures of grain, and the *Eight Governances* place agriculture first. Tilling the soil is the foundation of great virtue; paired plowing brings unchanging joy—the dwelling of extraordinary men. Advance, and you may soar with the phoenix; retreat, and you may join the ranks of Tao and Bo. In office, you would be a Boyi; at home, a Qianjin. Thus the ancients divided fertile fields to share their bounty, toiled with their limbs to sow and reap, scattering beans and millet in lush abundance, nurturing vegetables in orderly rows. They filled a thousand granaries with wheat and black millet, amassed countless bushels in their storehouses. They rode forth in chariots for the hunt, returned in court robes to feast on jade-like viands. Yet this gentleman’s dwelling fares otherwise: in scorching drought, the grain flies away as dust; in heavy rains, the land is drowned. Hills and fields bear no sprouting shoots; waters yield no ripened stalks. Weeds and chaff fill the granary, firewood rots in the kitchen. Still, he clings to his resolve, awaiting the hare at the snare, untroubled by thoughts of advance or retreat.\n\nI fear the fate of Boyi will soon befall him, that the hardship of Danshan will befall him in an instant. Others may grow cold at the thought—why does he remain so unconcerned? He who sees the opportunity yet does not act cannot be called wise. To cling to one’s land without change is the way of the common crowd. How could one who delights in the stench of rotting fish forget the orchid’s fragrance? How could one lost in confusion so easily alter his nature? Why has this gentleman remained so long unaware?” The rustic is perplexed.",
      "overlap_context": "t delight, retreating without sorrow. Such men would rather die in obscurity by their earthen windows—how could they deign to display their priceless treasures to vie with the sale of mere swallow stones?\n\nThe Ways of Confucius and Mozi once went unheeded; Meng Ke and Yang Xiong likewise faced adversity. That virtue goes unrewarded in its time is nothing new. The world lacks the keen-eyed Li Zhu to distinguish black from white; the era wants the swift Guan Qing, its fine steeds broken and bent.\"",

      "translated_text": "He does not recognize what is meant: the court robes and crowns are not garments to shield against frost and arrows; the classics and canons are not tools to relieve hunger and cold. Why not turn his gaze to the fertile plains of the four suburbs, take up the good work of the field and plow, set aside the impractical Six Arts, and gather a myriad granaries to trade for what is lacking?\n\nThe Reclusive Master replied: “One deaf cannot be urged to distinguish refined music from vulgar tunes; one blind cannot be held to tell cinnabar from lacquer. The frog in the well cannot be spoken to of the vast ocean; the common crowd cannot be instructed in the classics. If you, sir, know only the petty achievements of the old farmer yet fail to grasp the colossal folly of one who faces a wall—what difference is there between gathering grains of sand while discarding a priceless pearl, or turning toward a flickering candle while turning one’s back on the bright sun?\n\nTastes and preferences cannot be measured by a single standard; paths and pursuits cannot be exchanged between self and other. He who aspires to ascend the windswept heights of Langfeng or scale the peaks of Song and Hua will not linger on a molehill. He who intends to cross the Southern Sea and sail the vast ocean—how could he idle in a stagnant pool? Thus, one who lends a clear ear to the *Nine Shao* finds the clamor of the village unable to please his ear; one who feasts on the grandest meats and spreads a banquet of a hundred dishes finds the bitter herbs and smartweed unable to sweeten his palate.\n\nThe roc soars to the crimson clouds in lofty flight; the wren flaunts its wings in the humble thicket. Though their paths through marsh and land differ, each attains the utmost in flight. The moon’s phases pass swiftly—how fleeting the life of the morning mushroom, which knows not the mayfly! In an instant, the wild horses of summer exhaust their breath; the minnows and bream dart about with exposed scales, while the sacred dragon remains unused in the depths. Unfathomable are the ways of action, divergent their intentions—how can one grasp them?\n\nThough my coarse fare may not fill my belly, I am content with a life beyond the need for grand feasts. Thus, Liezi did not covet the salary of Zheng Yang despite his want; Zeng Shen did not trade his poverty for the riches of Jin or Chu. To preserve subtle teachings on the verge of extinction was the distant legacy of Zhou and Kong. To be zealous in the pursuit of profit is to be a criminal in the eyes of Master Meng.\n\nOne who seeks the distant does not tarry at crossroads; one who acts does not attempt to master both plowing and learning. To toil in body while at ease in spirit—what harm is there in living simply? Yet if one dwells in fertile lands and grows idle, idleness leads to neglect of learning, and neglect breeds extravagance. The pure find fortune gathered to them; the extravagant find calamity rushing toward them. When fortune gathers, even the humble may grow extravagant, and even the declining may rise. When calamity rushes in, even the strong may weaken, and even the living may perish. This comes unbidden and arrives unsummoned.\n\nThus, the noble man, wishing to correct what is amiss, must first rectify its root. If he dams the flow, he must first block the source. When the work of Dao and virtue is established, the gates of extravagance and waste are shut. Jiang Wang attained such virtue that his fields no longer needed sowing; Chong Hua, the great sage, fished without casting nets. Then did the jade tablet proclaim the blessings of Yingqiu, and the great merit stood twenty *zhang* high—why then mock idleness or scrutinize talent as if appraising a minister?\n\nThose two divided their wealth, taking the lesser share as sufficient; I now yield the world’s abundance, dwelling in this barren land of hardship and stone, forsaking the rich fields of Anchang for the desireless outskirts of the northern wall. If even the myriad things may be deemed small, what could ever be lacking? The North Star is revered among the stars for its unchanging position; the Five Peaks are honored among the mountains for their immovability. The cricket, though it moves often, is not prized; birds and fish, when sated in the depths, meet with disaster.\n\nI shall now clear the overgrowth of the Nine Classics and sow the fine seeds of the Six Virtues. Though my fields lie far from the highest grade of soil, will not their harvest be abundant? Why must one toil at plowing and sowing between heaven and earth?\n\nOf old, Xu You discarded his wealth to halt theft; the Yu family shattered their jade to curb greed. Shu Guang scattered his gold to spare his descendants from disaster; Sun Ao chose poverty to dispel the anxieties of desire. Niu Que, laden with treasures, invited bandits; Tao Kan, with his hoarded wealth, summoned misfortune. The contrast between gain and loss is clear—can one afford not to take heed?”\n\nAt this, the questioner fell silent for a long while, his mouth agape yet unable to speak, his head bowed yet unable to lift it. He sighed deeply and said: “At first, I sought to establish words of immortality, not to be drowned in the pursuit of property. I chased the achievements of the lowered curtain, not to let my gaze wander to the garden. You, sir, with your fondness for the tender chick and your schemes for pheasant and crab—do you not find this base? How vulgar! That you did not know this sooner!”",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Thirty-Six: Embracing Poverty**\n\nThe *Baopuzi* said:\n\nIn the late Han, the flame of the dynasty dimmed, dragons warred and tigers contended, the Nine Lands split asunder, and the Three Families seized the tripods. There was a man called Master Le Tian who fled turmoil, drifting from place to place, wandering through Min and Yi. At first, he dwelt in intimacy with Wen Xiu, yet remained unknown to Kongming. His words were lofty, his conduct square, standing alone and apart from the crowd. The people of his time held him in awe, and none dared approach him. Though the power of the two lords of the age could not be defied, they allowed this scholar to languish in obscurity. His teeth aged like the mulberry and elm, yet he did not alter his coarse cloth. The ruler of the time longed for worthy men, but those in power neither recommended nor promoted him. He hid in the humble lanes of Wu, concealed in a thatched hut by the pivot of the gate. He forsook the affairs of governing the world and neglected the business of sustaining life. His meals of wild greens were often empty; he did not plan for the evening by morning.\n\nThereupon, a young man of conventional society visited and questioned him, saying: “I have heard that one with the talent of Yi or Lü does not long remain mired in poverty and lowliness, nor does one possessing the methods of Yi Dun endure hunger and cold for long. The wise value knowing when to change; the intelligent test their worth by not clinging to the past. When Fan Li emerged, he aided Wu and saved Yue, becoming a counselor for the age; when he withdrew, he engaged in trade and amassed wealth of ten thousand gold. Poverty is among the six misfortunes; wealth is among the five blessings. The *Book of Songs* praises the fortunate; the *Book of Changes* values gathering people. Cast fragrant bait, and sturgeon and salmon come; offer a rich reward, and the resolute are roused. Sima Xiangru shed his apron and held the vermilion tassel; Chen Ping left his humble door and enjoyed the fief of Maotu. Lü Buwei was thus fed by a domain of ten thousand households; the Marquis of Jiang was thus delivered from prison’s confinement. Thus, the lowly minister’s frugality brought regret and disgrace, while the drifting old woman’s generosity earned a thousand gold in return.\n\nYou, sir, possess no extraordinary strategies like Xiao Bo, yet you focus your keen thoughts solely on the Six Classics. You ignore the real disaster of starvation, yearning instead for the empty fame of immortality. You are ashamed to seek office through devious means, disdain to peddle your talents for glory, hope for the stratagems of King Wen, and await the clearing of the Yellow River. You willingly endure the emaciation of Liezi, aspire to preserve your spirit while neglecting your conduct—how is this different from painting a fine steed to replace the toil of walking, or pointing to the sea to quench a parched mouth? Casting a fishing net upon a towering peak or dangling a hook from the tip of a tall tree, though you may deem it right, is this not still impractical and absurd?\n\nNow, within the seas, the realm is divided, heroes vie in strength, and the cunning of the age are exiled like Xia. The swift and the slow race along the same path; jackals and wolves bare their fangs in mutual strife. Those in power cast nets to ensnare the upright; scholars of purity are trampled underfoot on the path. Pure scholars abandon the Dao of emperors to practice the arts of the Five Hegemons; great minds forsake the Four Disciplines to heed the monthly critiques. Those with full baskets advance from the wilds; those lacking resources retreat from the court. Those who grasp alchemy push through the golden gates to ascend the jade halls; those who recite esoteric texts make lifelong enemies and sink into the mire. Those with lavish gifts turn tiles and stones into jade; those with meager offerings discard dragons and fine steeds like weeds. Those with many allies soar with the whirlwind; those with few companions swim with the lame turtle. A pellet of mud cannot dam the boiling of Pengli, yet how can a lone worthy reverse the current and avoid the error of fleeing the world?\n\nNow, sir, you have no store of grain at home, no bundle of dried meat to offer abroad. You merely harbor hidden brilliance like the phoenix, conceal patterns like the tiger and leopard, speak like the surging waves, and array your words like brocade. Yet you freeze and starve within crumbling walls—what plan do you have to avoid pity? Why not launch a light boat to seek patronage, ride swift sails to distant lands? Trade rare goods in the north and south, gather gold and jade from Jiuyi, follow the distant footsteps of Jiao Lie, and secure fine office in this clear age. Instead, you exhaust yourself in writing—is there any end to this molting like the cicada? You merely wear yourself out for fame, which even the Yellow Emperor and Laozi would scorn.”\n\nMaster Le Tian replied: “When the Six Arts are thoroughly studied and the Eight Compilations fully mastered, this is wealth. When brushes are wielded to compose, and virtuous words are inexhaustible, this is nobility. Seek benevolence, and benevolence arrives—what more is there to desire?”",

      "translated_text": "As for dwelling deep in the abyss to nurture the numinous, dismissing the myriad things to find contentment, casting worldly dust from perilous paths, and clarifying the spirit in profound silence—never gazing through windows for distant vistas, discerning right from wrong without confusion—even if you set before me tripods and thrones, I would not alter my resolve. How could I then fret over poverty and vie with merchants for profit, or grieve over hardship and compete with the vulgar for success?\n\nIf you know that trading can amass treasures and tilling can stave off hunger, you must also recognize that the deer-chaser heeds not the hounds, and the distant traveler arrives not late. Moreover, Lü Shang, though but a knife-wielding butcher, later revealed his brilliance. A weight of ten thousand *jun* may be heavy, yet a whirlwind cannot shift it; the *Xiaoshao* melody may not reach its ninth movement, yet the sacred birds do not bow in ceremony. Thus, those who await the ascending winds to soar into the azure skies do not crouch in the tips of mugwort and wormwood; those who gallop with reins of orchid to scale the six directions do not contend for paths with the crowd.\n\nThe herd of lame donkeys fears the perils of filial devotion, so Zichun trembled at the thought of his father’s fall. The supremely wise do not prize hard-won talents, so Yao and Shun discarded gold and cast aside jade. The enlightened avert disaster before it arises; the wise, hearing of profit, weigh its harm. Yet you urge me to launch a boat, diligently seeking wealth within gilded halls—encouraging me to sling a Sui pearl to shoot a sparrow, or snatch meat from a tiger’s jaws. You would have me risk my body in the unpredictable, brave grave dangers for distant gains, forgetting the clear warnings of flesh and hair, chasing ruin in peril, hoping for fortune in calamity.\n\nThen there are those who overturn chariots on flaming wheels, topple trees from cliffs, split rocks with flying stones, or stand where mountain peaks loom over surging waves—light boats drift like dust, strength fails the will, and all they can do is weep without achievement, only then awakening to the foresight of the wise.\n\nOf old, Yan Hui was praised for his purity amid hardship; Chen Ping escaped peril by having no gold; Guanghan perished for his love of profit; Niu Que was reduced to ashes for carrying treasure. A common man dies in vain for clinging to jade; Feng Hu summoned disaster with fine furs. Now you would have me wield the craft of teaching thieves, urge me toward the path of inviting bandits, and proffer poisoned wine in toasts—this is no way to nurture life.\n\nRather, the scholar treats the *Three Rites* as gold and jade, the *Five Canons* as zither and zheng, discourse and study as bells and drums, and the Hundred Schools as reed pipes and flutes. Let those who savor the Dao be sated by its words, and those who intoxicate themselves with virtue be awakened by its principles. Rise above the common stream, tread loftily, surpass the ages, and let your name resound. Gallop alone on the long path—what need have you for the filth of wealth?\n\nFor those who hoard much lose abundance; those who favor modesty are envied for their fullness. Concealing a night-shining pearl invites swift destruction; following the tracks of an overturned cart ensures a fall. Overloading a boat sinks it; seeking victory destroys life. These are the concerns of lesser men, not the pursuits of those who embody the highest virtue.\n\nThereupon, the questioner stood in bewildered silence, lost in thought, and begged to be enrolled as the least of the disciples, forever treasuring the true formula for long life.\n\n*Renming*, Chapter Thirty-Seven",

      "translated_text": "Bao Puzi said: The disciples together debated the precedence of *ren* and *ming*, each presenting their views, and so they consulted me. I told them:\n\nThe Three Luminaries suspend their images—this is *qian*. The earth bears all without end—this is *kun*. *Qian* possesses *ren* and also *ming*; *kun* possesses *ren* but lacks *ming*. Is not the distinction between high and low thus vast?\n\nOnly the sage aligns his virtue with Heaven. Thus, Tang Yao crowned his canons with \"reverence and clarity,\" while Confucius placed \"illuminating *yi*\" at the head of his chapters. \"Illuminating, illuminating on high\"—this is the title of the sovereign. \"The perspicacious preserve themselves\"—this is the lost trace of the *Greater Odes*.\n\nEven the flying midge and creeping worm possess *ren*, for their intent to cherish and nurture is evident, and their sorrow at chirping distress is manifest. Yet they rush into pits and wells without suspicion, enter snares without awareness—possessing *ren* but lacking *ming*, they hasten together toward calamity.\n\nHad it not been for the blazing brilliance of the hidden sun, jade tablets and capped pillars would have been exchanged for woven mats; had it not been for the framing of halls and roofs, nests and burrows would not have been abandoned. The selection of grains to eliminate poison, the fashioning of garments to replace nakedness, the harnessing of boats and oars to cross impassable waters, the yoking of oxen and horses to rest from bearing burdens, the ordering of ranks and dignities to quell disorder, the forging of tools and weapons to guard against unforeseen threats, the creation of writing to govern the hundred officials, the establishment of rites and laws to refine customs—all these are the works of great *ming*, not the distinctions that partial men can discern.\n\nIf the heart does not depart from *ren* yet *ming* does not govern the state, how can the disasters of peril and ruin be averted? This much is clear.\n\nTo gauge prosperity and decline before their signs appear, to probe the subtle workings of affairs before their forms take shape, to point out hidden dangers beyond the surface of principle, to resist insidious influences at their root—this is the achievement of *ming*.\n\nTo extend compassion to all creatures, though wronged yet not retaliating, to alter the sacrificial victim upon seeing its trembling, to avoid trampling the tender reeds—this is the function of *ren*.\n\nOtherwise, *ming* is but talent, and *ren* is but conduct.",

      "translated_text": "The act of sacrificing oneself to perfect others may be striven for and attained, yet the clarity that fathoms the profound and probes the obscure cannot be falsely assumed. The distinction between refinement and coarseness stands starkly evident.\n\nIf one embodies the *ren* that cannot bear suffering yet lacks the *ming* that discerns right from wrong, the heart becomes confounded by truth and falsehood, the spirit disordered by crimson and violet, unable to distinguish grades or recognize good and evil. Failing even to secure one’s own safety, how can one establish a foundation to aid others?\n\nOf old, the Duke of Zhou was not without fraternal love, yet he wept to restrain his kin; Shi Que was not without natural tenderness, yet he severed private ties to serve the public. For they clearly perceived the nature of affairs, did not drown in proximate sentiments, and thus became pure ministers, cutting off affection for the sake of benefit, curbing *ren* with *ming* to temper its use. *Ren* may be temporarily set aside, but *ming* cannot be absent.\n\nThe mandate of Heaven was revolutionized by its *ming*.\nXu Yan cultivated *ren* to unify the court, yet his domain cast aside the peril of moats and walls, and within, there were no shields or spears in readiness—ruin and destruction befell his state and house, a calamity born of *ming*’s absence.\n\nThe disciples said: Confucius sighed that *ming* and *ren* are burdens heavy and the Way distant. He also said: \"If a man lacks *ren*, what can ritual mean to him?\" And again: \"If I claim sageliness and *ren*, how dare I?\" Mencius said: \"*Ren* is the dwelling; *yi* is the path.\" A man without a heart of compassion is not *ren*. The Three Dynasties gained the world through *ren* and lost it through its absence—these are the maxims of sages and worthies, the manifest proofs of bamboo and silk.\n\nYet you, sir, exalt *ming* without citing canonical evidence. I, a benighted student, remain perplexed.\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity replied: The ancients said, \"To love *ren* but not study is to be led into folly.\" You come close to this, my young friend. Once, the six states devoured one another, wolves and tigers vied in strength, cunning and deceit prevailed below, while virtue and morality were abandoned, and killing and aggression displaced yielding and deference. Mencius arose, seeking to suppress the rapacious and brutal, to exalt and elevate *ren* and *yi*—how could he not earnestly and repeatedly extol *ren* alone? Yet never did he utter a single word that *ren* surpasses *ming*.\n\nIt is like a time of plague, when physicians and shamans are prized, and all speak with one voice of medicines and stones—could one then claim that the art of acupuncture and moxibustion surpasses the Way of long life and enduring vision?\n\nMoreover, I hold that the matters of *ren* and *ming* are spread across the four directions, aiming only to cut to the essence and illustrate the broad outlines, to grasp the spirit and point to one corner. Yet you still say, \"In daily use yet unknown,\" and claim that *ming* lacks evidence—how so?",

      "translated_text": "Qian declares, \"Great brightness begins and ends, completing the six positions in their seasons\"—this establishes Heaven to show that nothing is not encompassed. Kun states, \"Utmost yielding, the myriad things rely on it for birth\"—this is the virtue of Earth, which with *ren* bears and follows alone. Is not the principle of precedence and succession thus luminously clear?\n\nThe *Odes* says:\n*\"Bright, bright is the Highest Heaven,*\n*Illumining the lands below.*\n*Bright, bright is the Son of Heaven,*\n*His illustrious fame unceasing.\"*\n\nThe *Changes* states: *\"The king faces south toward brightness and receives its blessing.\"* The *Appended Judgments* say: *\"Obscurely assisting the numinous brightness, numinously brightening it.\"* Here, brightness and the numinous form a single body—how could pure *ren* alone presume to reach it?\n\nConfucius said: *\"Keen of hearing, bright of vision, divine in martiality,\"*—he did not say *\"keen of ren.\"* Again he said: *\"Of old, the bright kings governed all under Heaven,\"*—he did not say *\"ren kings.\"* The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: *\"Bright virtue is most fragrant,\"*—it does not say *\"ren virtue.\"* The *Documents* says: *\"The sovereign’s head is bright indeed!\"*—it does not say *\"ren indeed!\"*\n\nLaozi sighs: of the highest scholar, he says *\"bright-eyed, seeing in all four directions,\"*—while of the declining and meager, he says *\"losing the Dao, then virtue; losing virtue, then ren.\"* The *Changes* states: *\"The king faces south toward brightness,\"*—it does not say *\"toward ren.\"*\n\n*\"If I desire ren, ren comes.\"* And again: *\"To practice ren lies with oneself.\"* Thus, *ren* is something everyone can achieve. But how can one command brightness and keen perception? Hence Mencius says: *\"Whenever people see a child about to fall into a well, none fail to rush forward to save it.\"* From this we see that none lack the heart of *ren*—only in its depth or shallowness does the distinction lie, while the division of brightness and perception arises in due time.\n\nOf old, Cui Zhu did not kill Yan Ying. Though Zhu was greatly un-*ren*, he yet possessed a small *ren*. Thus even treacherous ministers and murderous sons may still have *ren*.\n\nA disciple further says: *\"The *Changes* speaks of establishing the human Dao as *ren* and *yi*—thus nothing in humanity surpasses *ren*.\"*\n\nBaopuzi replies: *\"The reason I speak thus is that *ren* lies in action—action can be established, and brightness, joined with the numinous, must be a talent bestowed by Heaven. It is not what can be taught to all.\"*\n\n**Extensive Analogies, Thirty-Eight**\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"A weight of ten thousand jun must begin with a zhu; towering heights that pierce the clouds must begin with a hair’s breadth. Thus trickling streams gather to form the Southern Sea, and span upon span accumulates to reach the boundless expanse. The commonplace piles up to attain the gardens of the immortals, and the utmost heights of Heaven.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Those who gallop swiftly may leave their shadows behind yet not grow weary; those who ride the wind and cleave the waves may cross peril yet not capsize. Thus the great ministers divided their duties, and the achievements of emulating Heaven were accomplished; Yi and Lü were entrusted, and the merit of revolution was achieved.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Jade boats and coral oars are of no use in crossing rivers; golden bows and jade arrows cannot propel a shot. Thus those who are incorruptible yet lack governance are not instruments for quelling disorder; those who are refined and elegant yet lack administrative strategy are not talents for assisting a ruler.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The towering heights of Langfeng and the immortal gardens do not borrow elevation from a mound; the luminous *xuan* and *jielü* jades do not seek display from common stones. Thus the heroic and peerless exude the fragrance of hidden orchids, startling all with their lofty bearing; the resolute and independent evoke the cries of myriad birds, their voices resounding.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Ice and charcoal do not boast of their cold and heat; fine jades do not prove their worth by their luster. Thus the noble person, reverent in self-cultivation, does not fret over being unknown; the perfected person, dwelling in stillness, leaves behind praise and blame.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"A whirlwind may topple mountains yet cannot exert force on an autumn hair; fire may melt metal and stone yet cannot cast its glow upon a tiny stream. Thus Han Xin excelled in warfare yet was clumsy in the strategies of governance; the Marquis of Xiang kept the altars secure yet lacked ready eloquence in response.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Those who pursue fame do not find risking their lives difficult; those who value themselves do not let near desires burden their hearts. Thus Ji Xin gladly turned to ashes without regret; Yang Zhu equated a single hair with a city of linked jade.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The minnow does not comprehend the distant journey of the divine dragon; the teal and duck know not the mismatch of the swan and crane. Thus those who plow in pairs mock Chen Sheng for casting aside his plow; the shallow-minded ridicule Kongming for clasping his knees.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The edge of a pure blade is tested against rhinoceros and buffalo; the excellence of proclaimed kindness is proven through clear trial. Thus when alike in office, the great ministers and petty officials are no different; when employed together, the swiftest steed and the slowest nag are indistinguishable.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"A vessel not of *hu* or *gui* must advance the sharp and retreat the dull. Though one’s measure be modeled on Yi and Lü, late in starting, one may yet arrive early. Thus the wren, weary of flight, does not surpass the tip of a thistle; the young phoenix, rising slowly, gazes about and cries to the azure vastness.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Nine times severed, four times joined—the *wenzao* and *zao* plants thus display their numinosity. Branches broken, leaves crushed—the *chai* and *hui* herbs thus increase their fragrance. Thus Yi Wu, though shackled, built the achievements of rectifying the realm; the Marquis of Ying, though humiliated, left his meritorious deeds in Qin.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"When what is contended over is trivial, interests align and enmity forms; when good and ill take different paths, affairs diverge and knots arise. Thus the ugly Momu and the hunchbacked woman despised seeing Xi Shi’s lovely face; the young Shang Chen and Xiaobai resented hearing of Yan Zhou’s retired plowing.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"When acuity and dullness diverge in their tracks, those who lag behind feel shame and regret; when strength and weakness differ in their categories, those who lift tripods are envied. Thus Han Xin was promoted to prominence, and the mediocre grew sullen and resentful, hastening his downfall; Wu’an’s achievements were lofty, and Fan Sui adorned his words to ruin his affairs.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"A fatal illness will not reject bitter medicine; rotting wood will not accept carving and ornament. Thus Bi Gan, though not self-serving, had his heart cut out for his utter loyalty; Tian Feng, though farsighted, was executed for his forthright words.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The solitary tong tree of Yiyang cannot, without a pillar, produce its mournful tones; the solitary bamboo of Great Xia cannot, without being blown, emit its clear notes. Thus when office is lowly, even Hou Ji and Xie cannot bring peace to the common weal; when authority is meager, even Yi and Zhou cannot attain the heights of governance.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Those who climb heights are cautioned against the perils of the summit; those who cross deep waters meet disaster when their boats are overloaded. Thus in the west, Qin had Li Si, who rued his rise from Shangcai; in the east, Yue had Wen Zhong, who regretted his fullness of opportunity.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Hard and soft possess unchanging natures; integrity and flexibility have their inherent qualities. Thus a hundred smeltings do not diminish the true essence of southern gold; peril and hardship do not make the resolute man lose his rectitude.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Without following the Dao, wealth and nobility are not worth dwelling in; forsaking *ren* and abandoning *yi*, even long life to a hundred years is not worth begrudging. Thus Bian Sui cast himself into the river with a stone; Zhong You willingly went to the blade.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"High and low cannot be leveled as one; fine grain and coarse fodder cannot encourage or discourage alike. Thus Hui Shi fretted over the glory of a thousand chariots; Zhuang Zhou worried over the abundance of ways to catch fish.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Withdrawal and engagement differ as ice and charcoal; impatience and calm diverge as flight and sinking. Thus Mo Di found joy in thick calluses; the northern elder found contentment in leaving the world behind.\"*",

To quell strife not by the Dao or resolve it not by principle is like embracing ice to dispel cold, hefting a heavy furnace to repel heat, chasing light to escape shadow, or boring a boat to quench thirst.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"A wise ruler appoints men to office without exceeding their capacity; a loyal minister occupies his position without overstepping his measure. To grant office beyond one’s talent or burden with tasks beyond one’s strength is like filling an ice bowl with boiling water, wrapping a blazing fire in reed sheaths, fastening a ten-thousand-*jun* weight to a rotten rope, or loading a double burden onto a fragile skiff.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The fur of leopard and fox is not for the woodcutter; the nine movements and six transformations of music are not for the deaf. To raise one’s voice in distant harmony is not for the common fool; to speak boldly and act resolutely is not for the man of meager virtue. To compose the *Baopuzi*—\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"When the people’s wealth is exhausted yet demands do not cease, when their strength is spent yet labor does not pause, to hope that resentment will not arise and long for lasting peace is like severing roots to graft branches, cutting flesh from the back to patch the thigh, gouging out eyes to broaden sight, or slicing off ears to sharpen hearing.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Laws have no fixed form yet one admires their timely adaptability; achievements do not surpass the past yet one delights in frequent change to suit the俗. This is like trimming a tall horse to fit a low carriage, shaving the ankles to fit tight shoes, breaking a long sword to fit a short scabbard, or cutting a foot-wide jade disk to fit a narrow box.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The great fish with long scales does not emerge from narrow valleys; the lofty trees where phoenixes perch do not flourish on low mounds. The profound maxims of the Nine Categories are not uttered by the mouths of the common and base; the exalted teachings of the Golden Tablets do not arise from the bosoms of ordinary folk. Seeing a branch a hundred arm-spans wide, one knows its root is not slender; beholding the vast and deep patterns of a man, one perceives his depth and breadth.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The mulberry groves and dense forests have no cypress or pine to chill the air; the fertile fields near the city walls have no famine relief to dispel hunger. Yet from these come silken cocoons and fine fabrics, filling a thousand granaries and ten thousand storehouses. Thus, those who see far value the root; those who see near pursue the branch.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"One who grasps the coarse is bound to form; one who knows the refined attains the spirit. One who traces beginnings and sees endings has a thread of inference; one who grasps things before their signs appear has no need to borrow from external causes. Thus, to see heaven and earth by day is not deemed keen; to discern the finest hair at night is called peerless.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The fragrant blossoms of spring cannot long leave their branches; the great fish that swallow boats do not abandon the deep waters to preserve their lives. Thus, one whose name is fair yet whose substance does not match will lack enduring reputation; one whose rank is high yet whose capacity does not suffice will not escape the downfall of inviting bandits.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"To endure the bitter medicine and piercing stone is to remove life-threatening illness; to don the heavy chill of armor is to ward off the rain of arrows. To embrace the constraints of pure conduct is to preserve the integrity of one’s work; to accept the most heart-chafing admonitions is to avoid the confusion of changing course.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"When phoenixes and simurghs vie for grain in the courtyard, they are loved no more than chickens and ducks; when dragon scales are mixed among the fodder of common beasts, they are defiled among the six sacrificial animals. Thus, the elder of Shang perched on the heights to spread his lofty and distant conduct; Bian Sui plunged into the depths to preserve his reputation of leaving the world behind.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"A deep well not dredged grows muddy and foul; fine grain not weeded becomes choked with tares. To study without reflection is to be beset by doubts; to lecture without precision is to prolong confusion and waste effort.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"To hoard ten thousand gold in chests and coffers, though one be frugal and never use it, is no different from poverty. To harbor refined thoughts in the heart yet never commit them to brush and silk is no different from the common and base.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Nan Wei and Qing Qin, paragons of beauty, must still await splendid adornment to enhance their loveliness; Yan Hui and Zi Xia, though gifted with genius and brilliance, truly required the classics to broaden their wisdom.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Red curtains and woven nets, layered and doubled, obscure even the fairest form; vermilion lacquer and intricate decoration, dazzling and bright, conceal even the gnarled wood. Thus, when the Six Arts are mastered, the base are transformed into gentlemen; when praise is widespread, the rustic are drawn near to the noble.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"In dense forests and tangled thickets, the feathered tribes gather like clouds; in deep and boundless waters, the scaled multitudes vie to arrive. Where virtue and work are vast, those who lodge their hearts are many; where flaws are noted and use is distant, those who draw near are few.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"To seek the fleetest of flying and swiftest of running creatures yet be unable to gallop freely on the Lü Liang rapids, to command creatures that tread waves and swim the depths yet be unable to scale heights and climb perilous peaks—thus, Li Zhu could split an autumn hair at a hundred paces yet could not distinguish the eight tones’ refinement; Zi Ye could harmonize the rarest of numinous sounds yet could not point out black and white at a foot’s distance.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"When the four faculties of hearing are widely opened, even Xihe receives the light of myriad fathoms; when the self is emptied, even the trickling streams gather. Thus, the way of broad inquiry is revered, and rare knowledge fills the court; the brilliance of the beacon tower shines, and extraordinary men knock at the gate. The tree for slander is set up, and faults are surely known; the drum for forthright admonition is hung, and straight words are surely offered.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"No one fails to praise the governance of Yao, yet not all of it was necessarily good; no one fails to condemn the rule of Jie, yet not all of it was necessarily bad. Thus, a single withered branch does not diminish the lushness of the forest; winter wheat does not undo the autumn’s severity. Xi Shi had her flaws, yet they could not lessen her beauty, for her beauty was abundant; Mo Mu had her virtues, yet they could not redeem her ugliness, for her ugliness was profound.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "ly went to the blade.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"High and low cannot be leveled as one; fine grain and coarse fodder cannot encourage or discourage alike. Thus Hui Shi fretted over the glory of a thousand chariots; Zhuang Zhou worried over the abundance of ways to catch fish.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Withdrawal and engagement differ as ice and charcoal; impatience and calm diverge as flight and sinking. Thus Mo Di found joy in thick calluses; the northern elder found contentment in leaving the world behind.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Baopuzi says: *\"Body and reputation are difficult to advance together; merit and spirit are seldom preserved in full. Those whose virtue is fragmented suffer hardship yet find stability; those who use it to navigate the world enjoy ease yet face many dangers. Thus, birds of prey are trapped by their own fierce strikes; birds of eloquence are caged by their own cleverness. Jade is cut for its patterns; the three metals are smelted for their splendor. Orchids and iris are burned for their fragrance; catalpa and nanmu are hewn for their resonance. For this reason, the azure dragon, seeing Boyi, ascends to the dark clouds; the divine bird, encountering Mengxi, returns to the cinnabar cave. Ziyong forever sighs at the greatness of the heavenly bond; Zhuangzi mourns the sacrifice of the patterned ox.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"A thousand elk turn their antlers, and even fierce tigers must sheathe their fangs; a thousand birds gather in flocks, and birds of prey must clench their talons. Thus, when slander spreads through the four lands, even the Duke of Zhou cannot suppress it; when critics fill the roads, even Zichan has no way to silence them.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The beauty of Wei Shi cannot be surpassed by powder and rouge; the qi of the solstices cannot be augmented by breath. Therefore, those who harbor the measure of hidden excellence do not flaunt their bearing to display distinction; those who embody the vessel of transcendent rarity do not trouble themselves with petty praise to seek commonality.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The qilin halts at the phoenix’s perch—what it fears is scarcity; the fox howls and the owl shrieks—what the world loathes is their abundance. Thus, when men of talent fill the court, those who seek worthies never tire; when slanderers wield power, the loyal and steadfast gnash their teeth.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Great strength is not limited to Meng Ben and Wu Huo; graceful beauty is not confined to Zheng Dan and Mao Qiang. Swiftness is not the sole domain of Hua Liu and Su Shuang; decisive judgment is not the monopoly of Zhan Lu and Gan Jiang. Therefore, those who establish the enterprise of the Uncrowned King need not be the Qiu of Eastern Lu; those who practice the benevolence of healing withered bones need not be the Chang of the Western Neighborhood.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The divine bird’s cry resounds in the morning sun—though it brings no benefit to creatures, none below fail to listen with rapt attention. The owl gathers at night on the eaves—though it causes not a hair’s harm, none fail to cover their ears and cast blame. Thus, good words travel far without fail to please; evil speech arrives near without fail to offend—like the sun and moon, whose steadfast brightness admits no decline, or the crooked arrow, which is despised the moment it appears.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Shadows do not deviate from their forms; names do not stray from their realities. Thus, water without a source cannot stem the long flow that spreads eastward; untimely blossoms cannot endure the radiance of frost and ice.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Beasts with saw-like fangs, though crouching low, are still feared; insects that wield axes, though hiding their form, still command awe. The noble man, though impoverished, cannot be slighted; the petty man, though exalted, is not to be esteemed.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The qilin roams beyond the great wilderness, thus avoiding the disaster of traps and snares. The divine bird soars above the peaks of the Dark Garden, thus escaping the peril of nets and snares. Why must one dwell in crooked caves to harbor eternal fear? Why must one clutch reeds in the beak to wear a mournful guise? Therefore, those destined for the butcher’s block must love the fodder of the pen; those fated for the boiling pot must find comfort in standing in the courtyard.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The wise value discerning the echoes of governance from a thousand years past to uncover the traces of rise and fall. The discerning treasure spotting phoenixes among the frostbitten to extract those who can save the age. Yet to heed the clamor of the many and seek counsel from the mediocre is not the clear hearing of Yan Zhou; to bend the talents of the distant worthy and consult the common man is not the extraordinary insight of the uniquely perceptive. Thus, to discuss the use of towering vessels with those who do not prize things is like having the blind point out the five colors; to plot the promotion of the fiercely upright with those who envy their betters is like entrusting the fox to mend the fur coat.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The roc and the *luan* bird suffer peril on the steepest cliffs, unwilling to endure the drudgery of captivity. The *jiguang* hungers and thirsts in the frozen wilds, unwilling to accept the fullness of sacrifice. The men of Guzhu did not trade their fasting for the riches of the Deer Terrace; Zifang did not barter his poverty for the abundance of the Copper Mountain.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Those whose aspirations align do not regard mountains and seas as distant; those whose paths diverge do not see a foot’s span as near. Thus, some cross vast distances to gather together, while others remain close yet never meet.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The splendor of embroidered robes is not the work of a single dye; the towering majesty of Mount Song is not the accumulation of a single basket. Thus, when the Nine Ministers were employed, the achievements of King Kang flourished; when the Four Lords were entrusted, the meritorious deeds of the royal aides shone forth.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The azure dragon soars to the heavens without wings; the flying snake darts like lightning without feet. The turtle hears well without ears; the earthworm projects its voice without a mouth. Thus, Gaoyao, though mute, matched the eloquent in merit; the blind man of Jin, though sightless, equaled Li Zhu in clarity.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Those in high office do not necessarily match their positions in talent; those with fair reputations do not necessarily live up to their names. Thus, saw teeth cannot chew; the tongue of a winnowing basket cannot distinguish flavors. The ear of a pot cannot discern sound; the nose of a sword cannot detect qi. The eye of a cauldron cannot capture the moonlight; the legs of a bed cannot chase the flight of a galloping horse.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The common traveler cannot draw the powerful bow of Yang You and hit the mark; Yanzi cannot grasp the reins and know of Dongye’s defeat. Thus, there are those who cannot lay the foundation yet recognize black and white at a glance; who cannot strum the zither yet understand the refined and the vulgar when they hear them.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The water that irrigates ten thousand acres must flow from the highest peaks; the flood that crests the heavens must arise from the tiniest trickle. Thus, world-shaking merit must come from a vessel of unparalleled excellence; the strategy to steady a tottering state must spring from a mind that transcends the common. Therefore, the nest of the tiny midge has no feathers to ride the wind; the ditches and streams hold no luminous jades of the night.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"The whirlwind fans the prairie fire, causing it to burn brighter, yet when fireflies and candles encounter it, they are extinguished. Sweet rain and nourishing dew cause flourishing life to thrive, yet when withered trees receive them, they hasten to rot. The vermilion wheel and ornate hub are the great treasures of the talented, yet when borne by the unworthy, they invite disaster. The cauldron of ten thousand measures and the bell of a thousand *zhong* are the proper rewards for meritorious service, yet when bestowed upon the mediocre, they lead to ruin.\"*\n\nBaopuzi says: *\"Rhinoceros hide is made into armor for the exclusive use of the commander; kingfisher plumes are gathered into ornaments for the empress’s headdress. Though they leave the deep valley for the towering tree, in the reckoning of these two creatures, it is better to hide in the thickets and preserve life in the brambles. Thus, the divine turtle would rather drag its tail through the mud than be treasured in a silk-lined box; the marsh pheasant delights in pecking ten steps away to avoid the disaster of chickens and ducks.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Baopuzi says: Partial talent is insufficient to govern the whole; narrow excellence cannot remedy the many shortcomings. Thus, the rooster knows the approach of dawn yet cannot fathom the reckonings of yin and yang; the crane recognizes midnight yet cannot grasp the principles of gnomon shadows. The mountain turtledove foresees fair weather and rain yet cannot comprehend astronomy; the snake and ant know the dwelling places of hidden waters yet cannot fathom geography.\n\nBaopuzi says: When prohibitions are unclear and harsh punishments are imposed to quell disorder, when ancestral temple divinations are imprecise and troops are exhausted to invade neighbors—this is like cutting grain to count locusts, felling trees to kill borers, consuming poison to strike fleas and lice, or removing the roof to chase sparrows and rats.\n\nBaopuzi says: Sharp blades emerge from dull stones; bright fires blaze from dark wood. Precious pearls arise from lowly clams; fine jade is hewn from ugly ore. Thus, one cannot measure the weight of Shun by his parents, nor gauge the merit of Wei and Huo by their ancestors.\n\nBaopuzi says: When aspirations are fulfilled, the countenance is joyful; when intentions are thwarted, the face is downcast. When the root withers, the branches dry; when the source is shallow, the stream runs dry. What lies within must manifest without; what arises near must be evident afar.\n\nBaopuzi says: Lovely forms and charming appearances differ in shape and hue, yet the delight they bring may be equal. Strings and bamboo, metal and stone—though their tones vary—equally please the ear. Casting arrows or sinking hooks, raising nets or lowering traps—though their methods differ—yield the same success. Establishing merit, composing words, or choosing one’s path—though their routes diverge—share a single noble aim.\n\nBaopuzi says: Abundant profit harbors the source of harm; exquisite beauty invites disaster. Thus, southern birds are slaughtered for their patterned feathers; cave leopards die for their striped pelts. Sturgeon and carp accumulate, and the deep pools run dry; deer and elk gather, and the lush forests burn. Gold and jade are prized, and bandits arrive; fame and rank rise, and worries and vexations follow.\n\nBaopuzi says: When autumn winds blow and the skies grow crisp, fine fans are set aside. When climbing perilous heights, light boats are abandoned. When weapons and war clouds arise, scholars retreat; when mourning and chaos are settled, warriors are dismissed.\n\nBaopuzi says: What is valued at ten thousand gold need not be seen to distinguish its worth; what has branches as thick as an embrace need not be measured to know its size. Thus, gazing at the vast embankment of a flood, one knows it will not rise from a puddle; observing the boundless expanse of a literary masterpiece, one knows it did not come from a pedant.\n\nBaopuzi says: Red blossoms and green grasses do not cling to crooked, withered stems; purple mushrooms and fragrant weeds do not grow in barren, salty soil. Thus, those who receive the jade tablet to announce success emerge from the gates of the four condemned; those who inherit the mandate from the cultured ancestors arise from the households of the stubborn and perverse.\n\nBaopuzi says: Good words in a dwelling resonate without limit; crooked or straight, if untrue, find no response near or far. Thus, in the wilds of Song, the planet Mars retreated; in the Yin court, close kin fled. White jade rings came from beyond the borders of Shaoguang; deer and horses transformed within the palace walls.\n\nBaopuzi says: Jing Ke and Zhu Hai did not display their courage at the gates of the timid; Meng Ben and Feng Fu did not brandish their weapons among rustic warriors. Eminent scholars and great minds do not refine petty arguments among the shallow; enlightened and noble men do not alter their brilliance amid the vulgar.\n\nBaopuzi says: Bowing and yielding are not the demeanor for repelling invaders; armor and helmets are not the adornments of the ancestral hall. Sashes and pendants cannot be used to wield blades in battle; measured steps and regulated strides cannot save from fire or drowning.\n\nBaopuzi says: Heaven and Earth nurture the myriad things, yet they do not recognize its grace—for its benefits are boundless. The great person transforms through spirit, yet the masses do not perceive its influence—for it governs what has not yet arisen. Thus, what is easily known is small; what is readily predicted is few.\n\nBaopuzi says: E Huang and Ren Si were not praised foremost for sericulture; Tang, Wu, and Han Gaozu were not lauded for trivial conduct. Those who gaze clearly at the three luminaries have no leisure to bend over well pools; those who purify their hearing with the *Shao* and *Hu* have no time to lend their ears to the mulberry groves.\n\nBaopuzi says: Appearances cannot always reveal the inner truth; reputation cannot always measure ability. Confucius resembled a stray dog; the Duke of Zhou was like rough-hewn timber. Gao Yao’s face was like a demon’s; Yi Yin’s form was like a withered skeleton. Yet Longyang and Song Chao were like clay figurines crowned with earth; the luminous pearl borrowed from Ru, Dong, and Deng was like brocade wrapping dust.\n\nBaopuzi says: Yao and Shun could not transform the utterly foolish, so their teachings failed among their own descendants. Jie and Zhou could not corrupt the supremely wise, so their evil did not taint the Three Sages.\n\nBaopuzi says: The greatest has limits to its power; the smallest has what cannot be taken. Thus, frost and killing cold cannot wither the lushness of beans and wheat; sweltering heat and oppressive humidity cannot melt the snows of the mountains. Whirlwinds churn the sea yet cannot make hidden springs surge; spring rains bathe the hills yet cannot make withered plants bloom.\n\nBaopuzi says: Weeping blood-jewels must be polished to gleam; the *Chenlumenglao* sword requires a whetstone to sharpen. Fine steeds like *Liuhua* and *Hua* await the royal groom to gallop far; the *Ji* constellation relies on the carpenter’s square to perfect its virtue.\n\nBaopuzi says: The perching phoenix and the soaring *yue* bird, though hungry and thirsty, do not wish to be caged in the kitchens of the palace; the divine *Cheng Huang* and *Tian Lu*, though famished, do not delight in fodder from the imperial stables. Thus, the old man who plucked cicadas forgot all things in the fragrant grove; the fisherman who dangled his line ignored the jade tablet of southern Chu.\n\nBaopuzi says: Square and round differ in form; movement and stillness diverge in purpose. Thus, the celestial sphere is honored for its motion, while the Earth is revered for its steadfastness. The seven luminaries and four seasons complete their revolutions to achieve success; the Five Peaks and Six Pillars stand firm to serve as anchors. Thus, Song and Mo of Chu preserved their states through swift action; Gan Mu and Hu Yuan repelled enemies through inaction.\n\nBaopuzi says: Those who find joy in hills and gardens may suffer in body yet find peace in spirit; those who exhaust themselves for others may rest in form yet labor in heart. Thus, those who carry jars to water gardens rejoice more than the grand ministers; those who vomit coarse grains delight more than those who feast from bronze tripods. Those who abandon their posts to escape the dark may appear dried and withered; those who wait through the night for dawn may weary and shorten their lives.\n\nBaopuzi says: Benevolence and cruelty are as distant as heaven and abyss; good and evil are as distinct as being and non-being. The *Zouyu* treads lightly enough to walk on air; wolves and jackals pounce in packs to harm life. Yu Qing relinquished his minister’s seal to aid the poor; Hua Gong yielded his three offices to recommend the worthy. Li Si, envious of those better than himself, killed Han Fei; Pang Juan, fearing those not his equal, punished Sun Bin.\n\nBaopuzi says: When one’s strengths are properly employed, no talent is discarded; when one’s weaknesses are scrutinized, nothing is suitable. Thus, light silk and misty gauze are exquisite in adornment yet cannot withstand arrows; the *Chenlu* and *Juque* swords are superb in cutting yet cannot be used to pick at one’s feet.",

Though they leave the deep valley for the towering tree, in the reckoning of these two creatures, it is better to hide in the thickets and preserve life in the brambles. Thus, the divine turtle would rather drag its tail through the mud than be treasured in a silk-lined box; the marsh pheasant delights in pecking ten steps away to avoid the disaster of chickens and ducks.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Baopuzi says: Minor flaws cannot mar a great vessel; brief ailments cannot burden enduring talent. The sun and moon bear the food of crows and kites, yet their blemishes do not hinder the splendor of their heavenly radiance. The Yellow River carries the turbidity of mud and silt, yet its towering waves do not impair its flow surpassing the mountains. A tree blocking the path cannot justify abandoning Guan Zhong; seizing fields cannot diminish Guan Yiwu. A stolen wife cannot discredit Xiao He; accepting gold cannot condemn Xiangru. Bribes cannot expel Chen Ping.\n\nBaopuzi says: Tigers and leopards cannot strike and bite amidst waves and breakers; winged serpents cannot ascend on days without mist. When pheasants and hares are the prey, phoenixes cannot match hawks and falcons; when plows and ploughshares are drawn, scaled dragons retreat to their lairs. Thus, warriors and brave men are useless in times of peace; towering scholars and reclusive talents are not prized in eras of striving might.\n\nBaopuzi says: When both are hobbled and yoked by the neck, the swift *qilu* is no different from a lame donkey. When deprived of forests and confined to cages, gibbons and apes are no better than badgers and raccoon dogs. When sheathed and unused, the *Longquan* sword is no different from a leaden blade. When great talent is given petty tasks, the extraordinary are no better than the mediocre. To demand the tracks of a thousand *li* from a tethered steed or to seek the merits of a master craftsman from a petty artisan—this is called lack of confusion, yet I do not believe it.\n\nBaopuzi says: Those who savor bitter herbs and eat mugwort must lack discerning palates; those who discard jade and gather pebbles must lack the wisdom to appraise treasures. To scorn the *Nine Shao* and delight in rustic tunes, I know they cannot commune with spirits or emulate the flight of the *xiang* bird. To rely on the mediocre while possessing extraordinary talent, I know they cannot order the proper norms or attain great peace.\n\nBaopuzi says: Those who grasp the ultimate principle of openness and obstruction are not distressed by adversity; those who understand that fate is inherent in nature do not rejoice excessively in the fulfillment of the Dao. Thus, when entangled in abysses and mires, they cast aside resentment and vexation; when ascending to the radiant throne, they show no elation. After three appointments, such is the man.\n\nBaopuzi says: Prosperity and decline depend on fate; poverty and success are insufficient to judge a scholar. Gain and loss lie in fitting the moment; honor and disgrace cannot measure talent. Timing cannot be forced; encounters cannot be known in advance. Thus, the Grand Duke was a husband abandoned by an old woman; Han Xin was a starving beggar; Xiao He was a petty clerk; Qing Bu was a criminal in exile. When they moved like dragons among lizards and coiled like phoenixes among sparrows, the deaf and blind called their words strange.\n\nBaopuzi says: The four spirit-beasts hide and roam as omens of great peace; recluses delight in seclusion as treasures of the state. Why must one crow at dawn or bear the bit and bridle of duty? There is the use of others’ abilities, and there is the use of my own. Those who follow their nature do not let fame disturb their harmony; those who cultivate life do not let things burden themselves.\n\nBaopuzi says: Those who measure talent before appointing do not seek achievements beyond the capacity of the vessel; those who assess ability before accepting do not bear responsibilities beyond their strength. Thus, those who light fireflies do not trouble the vast sea; those who lift tripods do not employ Wu Huo. To haul firewood and transport salt is not a task for the hooves of fine steeds; petty duties and trivial posts are not enough to bend the extraordinary.\n\nBaopuzi says: The flow of ditches and streams cannot carry the great ships of *Dai Bai*; vessels of a *sheng* or *ge* cannot contain the grain of a thousand *zhong*. Flickering lights cannot reveal the faintest glimmer; mediocre talent cannot distinguish the instruments of the exceptional. For the endowment of intelligence by creation has its roots.",

      "translated_text": "**Baopuzi, Outer Chapters, Scroll Four**\n*Guang Pi (Broad Analogies), Chapter Thirty-Nine*\n\nBaopuzi says: To establish virtue, fulfill one’s words, and preserve unsullied conduct—this is wealth. Why must one seek the grandeur of jade and silk? To hold one’s aspirations lofty, neither yielding nor debasing oneself—this is nobility. Why must one covet the purple and crimson of high office? When the common folk cannot fathom one’s measure and mediocre men cannot weigh one’s scale, this is true elevation. Why must one tread upon clouds or walk the rainbow? When none who inquire can plumb the depths of one’s abyss or those who seek detect any lack, this is true profundity. Why must one dwell in cavernous rivers or the boundless sea? If these four qualities are complete, though one’s chamber holds but a suspended chime of poverty, can one not still envy those who smelt mountains and boil seas? Though one dwells among birds and beasts, can one not still avoid bowing before crimson wheels and ornate chariots?\n\nBaopuzi says: The hidden spirit awaits auspicious clouds to ascend; the soaring swan relies on the stiff wind to traverse the void. The pale-scaled fish leaps only when the maiden’s hair is combed; the white pheasant arrives only when the Duke of Zhou appears. Jiang Ziya met King Wen and cast his line at Panxi; Han Xin and Zhang Liang encountered Gaozu and unleashed their talents to quell chaos.\n\nBaopuzi says: To clarify the spirit in the profound unity is to forget the form and vessel; to distance lofty integrity from external things is to leave wealth and rank behind. Thus, the crippled *Zhilipeng* delighted in transcending creation, and the reclusive *Jisou* of the northern tribes found contentment dwelling in the peaks of Mount Song.\n\nBaopuzi says: Coarse principles cannot fully penetrate perfection; no single ability can encompass all tasks. Thus, celestial bodies shine yet may be obscured by mountains and rivers; gold and jade are hard yet may be softened; firm ice may be melted. The Duke of Zhou could not match Bo Yi in scaling perilous heights; Confucius could not rival the swimmer of Lüliang in braving the torrent of a hundred blades.\n\nBaopuzi says: Thunder cannot refine its sound to harmonize with bells and stones; the sun and moon cannot withhold their radiance to favor those who crave partial light. Great rivers cannot hasten their banks to suit those who wish to cross swiftly; the Five Peaks cannot level their summits to please climbers. Thus, a broad carriage cannot force its wheels to squeeze through a narrow path; a lofty scholar cannot suppress his integrity to conform to vulgar constraints.\n\nBaopuzi says: Yin and yang extend their molding to benefit all things; the Three Luminaries universally illuminate. Mounts Song and Hua conceal infirmities to be called vast; the Northern Sea contains impurities to be deemed great. Eminent scholars advance with decorum; those who master the Dao embrace all with boundless love.\n\nBaopuzi says: The armor of the divine turtle need not be used in battle; the horn of the qilin and claws of the phoenix need not be employed in combat. Thus, the wise do not sheathe their swords in times of peace; watchmen do not cease their patrols even when danger is remote.\n\nBaopuzi says: Southern gold does not devalue itself for dwelling in obscurity; jade and precious stones do not cease their purity for lying in the depths. Those who uphold loyalty and the Dao do not alter their course due to adversity; those who guard integrity do not compromise for lack of reward.\n\nBaopuzi says: Those who ascend the *Xuanpu* realize the lowliness of hills and mounds; those who float the boundless sea recognize the shallowness of ponds and marshes. Only after perusing the Nine Classics does one awaken to the depth of one’s former blindness; only upon hearing the supreme Dao does one know the delusions of vulgar custom.\n\nBaopuzi says: The source of the primordial chaos yields no limpid streams; the root of a hair or down bears no branches of girth. A spark the size of a *cun* emits no distant flame; within a crack or crevice, no radiant throng gathers. A crooked hook casts no straight shadow; upon uneven ground, no level plane appears.\n\nBaopuzi says: Without beholding the brilliance of jade and quartz, one does not perceive the baseness of tiles and pebbles. Without witnessing the patterns of tigers and leopards, one does not know the plainness of dogs and sheep. Only after hearing the nine movements of *White Snow* does one grasp the extreme vulgarity of the *Barbarian Songs*. Only upon recognizing the vastness of refined elegance can one lament the stubborn ignorance of the unlearned.\n\nBaopuzi says: A jade bowl with no use is not as good as a whole vessel of clay; a torn inch of embroidered brocade is not as fine as sturdy, plain cloth. Thus, the impropriety of Xia Ji is not as pure as the solitude of a forsaken woman; the manifold crimes of the wealthy and noble are not as virtuous as the Way-walking of the poor and lowly.\n\nBaopuzi says: Fierce beasts do not unleash their claws beyond measure; hawks and falcons do not spread their wings to strike recklessly. If one within the court does not assess virtue before advancing, and without does not weigh one’s strength, it is like casting a feather into a raging furnace or snowflakes into a boiling cauldron—like morning mushrooms testing the *Ganjiang* sword or calves and lambs challenging tigers and leopards.\n\nBaopuzi says: When the Three Luminaries are obscured in the heavens, the clear light darkens on earth. When roots and fibers are uprooted here, branches and boughs wither there. When the Dao is lost nearby, calamity reaches afar; when governance falters above, the people suffer below.\n\nBaopuzi says: Those who focus on the distant may err in the near; those who govern externally may invite trouble within. One who covers the head does not necessarily keep the feet dry; one who shields the belly does not necessarily protect the back. Thus, the First Emperor of Qin built walls to block the Hu, yet disaster arose within his curtains; Emperor Wu of Han unfurled banners across ten thousand *li*, yet rebellion sprang from his own palace walls.\n\nBaopuzi says: Human talent has no fixed treasure; the use of instruments has no constant method. Those who advance or withdraw do so by adapting to the times; those who drive or restrain do so by aligning with the moment. Thus, when dark ice forms, the Five Brightnesses are set aside; when scorching summer blazes, furs and stoves retreat. When high-flying birds gather, fine bows are drawn; when cunning hares multiply, swift hounds run. When weapons rise, warriors rouse; when the *Shao* and *Xia* resound, literati emerge.\n\nBaopuzi says: Those who stir the current to join the morning river cannot abandon the Five Cities to leap the Jishi Mountains; those who unfurl emerald leaves and sprout crimson blossoms cannot forsake their mighty roots to discard their lush branches. To lose the source and sever the root is seldom not to wither; to rebel against the sages and violate the classics is seldom to achieve success.\n\nBaopuzi says: The Four Seas distinguish their sources; the Five Rivers diverge in their courses, yet all flow downward to the sea. Different paths lead to the same end; colors vary yet all are beautiful; sounds differ yet all evoke sorrow; fragrances are not uniform yet all are sweet; flavors are unequal yet all are delightful.\n\nBaopuzi says: Things are valued for their utility, while ornamentation is secondary. To transform customs with virtue is primary; words are secondary. Thus, plain cloth can ward off cold—there is no need for sable and fox; unadorned simplicity can craft things—there is no need for eloquent embellishment.\n\nBaopuzi says: When the gentle breeze stills, tumbleweeds drift; when the great net is spread, a myriad eyes align. Thus, there has never been a ruler who cherished humility yet whose subjects were arrogant, nor a lord who scorned treasures yet whose people were impoverished.\n\nBaopuzi says: Some matters succeed through precaution; some things achieve the distant through near governance. Thus, to tend the pond at one’s steps may draw deep-swimming fish from the rivers and seas; to enrich the grove of the eastern sun may summon divine birds from the cinnabar caves. To carve images upon plates and basins may bring jade dragons down from the *Xuan* skies; to cast ashes upon a foot of water may alter the moon’s chariot in the great ultimate. Thus, Duke Wen of Jin turned his wheels at Yong and brave warriors flocked to him; Goujian of Yue bent his back before the angry frog and his soldiers embraced death lightly. The Nine-Nine was revealed, and the hidden talents of *koujiao* arrived; the bones of the dead were buried, and the benevolence of the Three Divisions spread.",

      "translated_text": "Opuzi says: Fertile soil lies in the roots, and withered leaves bear blossoms; when the common folk take the ruler’s person as their model, transformation occurs without words. Thus, the Tang achieved great peace through deer-fur robes, and Duke Huan of Qi curbed extravagance by discarding purple. The construction of Zhanghua Terrace led to the excess of grand mansions, while the abandonment of Lutai brought about the spread of profound silence.\n\nOpuzi says: The keen-eared discern the rise and fall in the echo of vanished sounds; the perspicacious perceive the workings of fate before signs take shape. Thus, the men of Yue saw in Duke Huan of Qi the symptoms of decline in an unnoticed illness, and Jizi recognized in the ivory chopsticks of Yin the coming disaster of Lutai.\n\nOpuzi says: Heaven and Earth cannot dispense with spring and autumn to complete the year; a wise ruler cannot forsake punishment and virtue to achieve order. Thus, executing the noble establishes authority, and rewarding the lowly encourages goodness. If penalties reach the high, then the sprouts of treachery are crushed—this is not something the weak can accomplish. If kindness extends to the lowly, then distant people are drawn near—this is not something the miserly can achieve.\n\nOpuzi says: He who sails the vast sea must carefully observe the winds and qi to secure safe passage; he who governs must tremble at the thought of gain and loss to enjoy enduring blessings. What the benighted ruler dismisses is precisely what the enlightened ruler values; what a ruined state discards is precisely what a well-ordered age practices.\n\nOpuzi says: A hair’s breadth of error in the trigger deranges the entire aim; a misstep in granting or withholding here confounds right and wrong there. When good and evil are confounded, the constant norms are subverted; when merit and fault are unweighed, all undertakings collapse. Thus, the wise ruler’s rewards resemble spring rain, free from the excess of ceaseless downpours, while his punishments are like autumn frost, devoid of untimely severity.\n\nOpuzi says: For one who wields the scales of justice, what is weighty cannot be falsified; for one who relies on law and measure, what is beloved cannot be made private. Thus, he who gains men first gains them in himself; he who loses men first loses himself. There has never been one who gained himself yet lost others, or lost himself yet gained others.\n\nOpuzi says: The enlightened ruler personally wields authority and favor, never entrusting another with the instruments of power; the benighted ruler inverts shield and spear, though he calls it honor, his power slips away. Thus, to control rewards and punishments and thereby win the multitude was how Tian Chang usurped Qi; to monopolize authority and dominate the court was how Wang Mang overthrew Han.\n\nOpuzi says: Fixed regulations cannot meet changing circumstances; a single path cannot respond to boundless directions. Carving a mark on a boat cannot retrieve a lost sword; gluing the zither’s pegs cannot harmonize clear tones. Thus, emerald canopies are not raised in fair weather, nor vermilion wheels used in crossing streams. If the flavor is bland, add salt; if the pot boils over, add water and reduce the fire.\n\nOpuzi says: Cinnabar writs and iron tallies, the slitting of animals and smearing of blood cannot remedy the harm of broken promises—then even knotted cords would suffice for governance. The full might of the Five Punishments, the Nine Campaigns, and the extermination of clans cannot halt the treachery of covetous men—then even the shield-dance would suffice for transformation. Thus, the *Book of Documents* contains texts revered through the ages, and the *Book of Changes* adapts to the needs of the time.\n\nOpuzi says: One who possesses the clarity to recognize truth cannot be deceived by falsehood; one who possesses the wisdom to fathom depths cannot be deluded by shallowness. Otherwise, one might mistake vipers for winged dragons and foxes for qilin and phoenixes.\n\nOpuzi says: The world may praise in unison, yet the praised may not be worthy; custom may condemn with clamor, yet the condemned may not be evil. Thus, to welcome and approve is not as good as examining their deeds and testing their use; to reject and oppose is not as good as hearing their words and assessing their results. Then flatterers will not advance through empty talk, nor will true ability be set aside for its solitude. If the slow nag ceases to aspire to the grand chariot, and the warhorse gallops like lightning, how great the achievements that can be built, how distant the Dao that can be reached!\n\nOpuzi says: Rotten wood cannot withstand the wind of a collapsing mountain; a cliff with fissures cannot withstand the waves of a deluge. Thus, the seven hundred years of Zhou’s mandate and the thirty reigns of its kings were not solely due to the victory at Muye or the defeat of the inverted spears; the disaster of Lutai did not begin on the morning of *jiazi*. Its strength had long waned, and its fall was long assured.\n\nOpuzi says: To value the distant and despise the near is the common sentiment of men; to trust the ear and doubt the eye is the affliction of all ages. Thus, the King of Qin sighed over Han Fei’s writings and imagined his person, and Emperor Wu of Han was moved by Sima Xiangru’s prose and regretted not living in the same era. Yet when they finally obtained them, they could not elevate them—some accepted slander and executed them, others relegated them to idle posts. This is like Lord Ye, who loved the false form but paled at the sight of the true dragon.\n\nOpuzi says: A pearl does not shine at night and is no different from desert gravel; a kun fish that does not soar to the heavens is no different from a peach pit. A swift steed that swallows its voice mingles with the mute; a talent of surpassing ability, if suppressed, joins the ranks of the mediocre. Thus, the eel and loach disdain the crimson dragon in the muddy depths, and the slow nag defiles the fine steed in the field—unaware that when still, they are the same, but when moving, they differ.\n\nOpuzi says: Cast gold and jade upon the road, and passersby will halt; abandon brocade and fine silk in the mire, and onlookers will gasp in shock. Yet when men of lofty virtue are relegated to the company of the vulgar, or instruments of statecraft are discarded in straitened circumstances, critics do not protest their humiliation, nor do the successful rescue them from poverty. Some praise their writings yet stifle their persons; others employ their strategies yet forget their merit. This malady has persisted for ages.\n\nOpuzi says: If the source is not deep, its flow cannot embrace the mountains; if the peak does not soar to the heavens, its clouds cannot blanket the sky. If wealth is not abundant, its generosity cannot be vast; if talent is not far-reaching, its words cannot be rich. Thus, seeing tusks a yard long, one knows they did not grow from a mouth an inch wide; seeing branches a hundred fathoms long, one knows they did not sprout from the tip of a hair.\n\nOpuzi says: The divine phoenix rises at dawn in the cinnabar caves and gathers at dusk on the terraces of Xuanqiu; before the sun has shifted its shadow, it has traversed the nine realms, riding the wind and treading the clouds without hindrance—all because its six pinions are light and strong. The great talent and profound wisdom of men are likewise the six pinions of the state.\n\nOpuzi says: The waters of the Qi and Wei cannot flow back, yet their distant currents cannot be without ripples; the stirring of dust cannot be without sound, yet its mournful tones cannot be without cause. The virtue that surpasses the common and stands above the crowd cannot establish merit in times that have not yet arrived.\n\nOpuzi says: Vermilion and green adornments do not bloom on withered branches; the torrents of a collapsing mountain do not rise from a dried-up spring. The radiant flame of a night’s glow cannot reveal the forms of all things; the exhaustion of ambition and profit cannot make fragrant winds endure through the ages.",
      "overlap_context": "mages upon plates and basins may bring jade dragons down from the *Xuan* skies; to cast ashes upon a foot of water may alter the moon’s chariot in the great ultimate. Thus, Duke Wen of Jin turned his wheels at Yong and brave warriors flocked to him; Goujian of Yue bent his back before the angry frog and his soldiers embraced death lightly. The Nine-Nine was revealed, and the hidden talents of *koujiao* arrived; the bones of the dead were buried, and the benevolence of the Three Divisions spread.",

      "translated_text": "Opuzi says: A deep abyss that does not penetrate the earth cannot harbor leviathans that swallow boats; a towering mountain that does not reach the heavens cannot conceal jade and pearls or summon clouds and rain. One whose virtue does not transcend the common cannot gather a resounding reputation or establish profound substance. One whose resolve does not stand apart from the crowd cannot attain success or inscribe illustrious merit. Yet the mediocre man performs a cicada’s-wing good deed in the morning and expects the benefit of hills and mountains by evening—like planting millet and sorghum and sitting to demand a bountiful harvest.\n\nOpuzi says: One who bears no conduct surpassing the vulgar yet seeks the reputation of a lofty gentleman, who lacks the foundation of the Dao and its arts yet schemes for cliques and factions, desires to gather purity and nobility in this life and spread a virtuous name to posterity—this is like hiking up one’s robes to cross the vast sea or standing on tiptoe to leap the Nine Heavens.\n\nOpuzi says: A clay dragon, though painted in brilliant hues, cannot answer the summoning of auspicious clouds; a carved bird, though adorned with azure and gold, cannot rise on the wind’s ascent. A straw dog, though bedecked with gold and jade, cannot tread the light and halt in flight. Mediocre talent, though laden with favor and emolument, cannot make the heavens clear and the earth level.\n\nOpuzi says: When poisoned porridge is set out, rats with rotting guts gather beside it; when a bright torch is raised at night, moths cluster below to die. Where fine meats and grains abound, the cauldron and cutting board are ever in use; where small talent bears great responsibility, tears of blood flow like mulberry and huo leaves serve as warning. How grave the lesson of Fan Li, how clear the mirror of Fan Sui!\n\nOpuzi says: The vast sea, though it churns waves a thousand miles wide, cannot sweep the dust from mountain peaks; the howling wind, though it snaps trees of a thousand blades, cannot uproot the tender roots of grass. The roar of a tiger cannot intimidate a mosquito; towering talent cannot harmonize with the vulgar crowd.\n\nOpuzi says: Unyielding resolve is the master of merit and fame; unflagging diligence is the teacher of all virtues. One who does not halt before perilous heights when climbing a mountain will surely reach its loftiest ridges; one who does not complain of hardship and adversity in poverty will surely perpetuate a noble reputation.\n\nOpuzi says: The magpie, though not long-lived, cannot be denied its use as an instrument to save lives; scholars, though often poor and lowly, cannot be denied their ancient canons as tools to cultivate virtue. There are times when sowing yields no harvest, yet farming cannot be abandoned; there are times when practicing benevolence and righteousness brings misfortune, yet conduct and endeavor cannot be neglected.\n\nOpuzi says: Overloading without cease is what sinks my boat; advancing blindly and forgetting retreat is what endangers my person. Though a swarm of scorpions gathers on the body, its root may seem secure, yet it is surely a sign of impending collapse.\n\nOpuzi says: Auspicious clouds arise for the dragon’s ascent—not something a lizard or skink can summon; the whirlwind heralds the tiger’s charge—not something a fox or raccoon dog can bring forth. Thus, when a great man receives his mandate, men of surpassing talent gather like jade and silk; when hidden worthies are sought in secluded groves, the eminent rise from their rustic retreats.\n\nOpuzi says: Metal, by its hardness, breaks; water, by its softness, endures; mountains, by their height, shift; valleys, by their lowness, remain secure. Thus, one who holds to the feminine principle avoids the calamity of contending for dominance; one who exalts others too much invites the misfortune of resentment.\n\nOpuzi says: Han Xin concealed his valor beneath the crotch yet did not diminish his dragon’s leap and tiger’s gaze; Fan Ju concealed his brilliance in a soaking mat yet did not hinder his phoenix’s flight and pheasant’s rise. One became a lord facing south, the other governed the imperial court—thus, now humbled, now exalted, is how the light swan soars the void; now bent, now stretched, is how true talent awaits its time.\n\nOpuzi says: The lowly firefly, though humble in its dwelling, refuses to lodge in the rat’s den; the pure celestial cicada, though starving, disdains the dung beetle’s feast. Thus, Yu Rang rejected the gifts of Zheng and Yang; Zeng Shen scorned the treasures of Jin and Chu.\n\nOpuzi says: The whirlwind cannot stir the great sea’s waves; a hair’s tip cannot move a bell of ten thousand jun. Thus, Zhuangzi of Qiyuan sighed over casting away his gold; Bo Shi mourned Qi with tears of blood. A brief tune cannot summon refined harmony; power and profit cannot sway the heart of one who dwells in tranquility.\n\nOpuzi says: The bear and brown bear do not contend in agility with the fox; the golden eagle does not compete in striking with the small sparrowhawk. Thus, Zhang Er concealed his strength as a gatekeeper; Zhu Hai hid his valor as a butcher.\n\nOpuzi says: The fish is bewildered by fragrant bait; the tiger dies in the cage. The fox cannot be lured with a fishing line—that which comes must be a horned dragon; the unicorn cannot be enticed by snares and traps—that which is caught must be a qilin.\n\nOpuzi says: The soaring cloud knows not the filth of the mud-dweller; the noble rarely consider the toil of those below. Yet when roots rot, even the finest timber cannot preserve its thousand-mile luxuriance; when the people resent, even Yao and Shun cannot rely on enduring blessings.\n\nOpuzi says: Though a tree’s roots lie in sacred mountains, the master carpenter will still fell it with axe and adze; though a small fish dwells in the dragon’s pool, the fisherman will still cast his net. When mosquitoes gather on the eagle’s head, the osprey dares not peck; when mice nest beside the tiger, the wildcat dares not speak.\n\nOpuzi says: The sacred tortoise is silent yet auspicious; its subtlety is manifest without form. The spring frog croaks endlessly yet utters ugly sounds; its clamor brings only harm to the ear. Thus, the rare voice must resound greatly; the few words must carry weight.\n\nOpuzi says: The people of the eastern wilds despise the refined posture of sitting cross-legged; the tribes of the northern wastes abhor the scholar’s cap. Thus, the loyal and upright are cast out in an age of contention; the refined man finds no place in a world that hates the forthright.\n\nOpuzi says: A ladle of water cannot quench the burning of eight marshes; a handful of earth cannot dam the boiling of Mount Dizhu; a single blade cannot fell the forests of a long isle. Alone, one cannot halt the wrongs of cliques and factions.\n\nOpuzi says: A thousand sheep cannot defend against a single tiger; ten thousand sparrows cannot resist one hawk. A courtyard ablaze with torches does not match the last glow of the sun; a hundred drums beaten together do not equal the lingering echo of thunder. Thus, a court filled with mediocre men cannot set the constant norms in order; a single outstanding man is enough to root and sustain all affairs.\n\nOpuzi says: Unwarranted success is like winter blossoms on trees and shrubs; enduring hardship in holding to the Dao is like bamboo and cypress standing firm in frost. Thus, one who discerns prosperity and adversity through solitary insight, though pressed with blades and halberds, will not lose the true path or change course—how could he deign to flatter and smile to conform to the vulgar? One who embodies square integrity and abides in uprightness, though tempted with fiefdoms, will not betray his nature to follow the times—how could he tread crooked paths to ingratiate himself?\n\nOpuzi says: The crashing thunder cannot produce sound in the deaf man’s ear; the radiant sun, though it illumines the sky, cannot bend its light into a dark ravine. The bitter cold of solid ice cannot wither the winter-blooming flower; the scorching wind, though it melts stone, cannot topple the trees of Xiaoqiu. Thus, even the highest virtue has that which it cannot transform.",

      "translated_text": "Opuzi says: The drawn crossbow, the perilous trigger, the keen arrowhead—these are indeed to be feared, yet the bold pheasant rushes toward them without suspicion. Dark governance and chaotic rule, malice toward the upright and envy of the capable—these are most difficult to fathom, yet the greedy vie for them without avoidance. Thus, flying blades assail them unawares, and sudden ruin overtakes them before they can rally. Therefore, what delights the foolish man is precisely what the enlightened man laments. What mediocre talent pursues is precisely what great wisdom shuns.\n\nOpuzi says: When the wind does not cease, the fan is not needed; when the sun does not set, the candle is not lit. When blossoms do not fall, fruit does not form; when the bank does not erode, the valley does not fill. When the Nine Provinces are at peace, the merits of Han and Bai do not stand out; when a long-reigning lord succeeds the throne, the achievements of Yi and Huo do not arise. Thus, only in illness does one value the skilled physician; only in troubled times does one esteem loyalty and integrity.\n\nOpuzi says: Those who covet glory delight in praise, while those who dread disgrace abhor slander. Yet for one who penetrates the primordial unity, who harmonizes with the transformations of creation, who blends fullness and emptiness into a single strand, who equalizes gain and loss with a single gesture—love and hatred never begin to bind him, and success or failure cannot disturb his harmony.\n\nOpuzi says: One whose spirit is not muddied by gain or loss is utterly pure; one whose harmony is not adulterated by advantage or harm is supremely refined. Vast and boundless, it cannot be measured by ladle or cup; distant and unfathomable, it cannot be traced by half-step. Rare sound is the greatest tone; few harmonies exalt the self. How profound and remote is the Yellow Emperor’s Way—it does not share in the emptiness of death. How great is the matter of life and death—yet it does not alter one’s steadfastness. Why trouble oneself over trifling distinctions?\n\nOpuzi says: Where trees grow dense, the carpenter enters; where pearls are fine, the oyster is split. Stones containing gold are smelted; herbs bearing medicine are plucked. Sharp blades dull first; mournful strings break soon. When used to suit oneself, they are the true treasures of the perfected. When talent aligns with worldly demands, it invites the calamities of skill.\n\nOpuzi says: When the target is set, arrows fly toward it; when a fine reputation arises, slander and abuse assail it. Hoarding rare treasures does not invite resentment, yet resentment comes; when vessels are full and ambition proud, disaster is not summoned, yet disaster arrives.\n\nOpuzi says: Treasures worth a thousand cities cannot be purchased by the poor and humble; vessels of towering stature cannot be recognized by the shallow and vulgar. Yet a foot-long gem does not dim its luster for lack of appreciation, and a man of surpassing virtue does not diminish his integrity for being obstructed. Rejoicing in Heaven and submitting to fate—what grievance, what blame?\n\nOpuzi says: The great roc has no use for dawn’s vigilance; the giant elephant possesses no talent for swift pursuit. Thus, Jiang Wan failed in a hundred-li march yet became a paragon of the Three Excellencies; Chen Ping was exhausted in managing his household yet harbored the strategies of six ruses.\n\nOpuzi says: Clarity and obscurity are matters of talent, arising naturally and beyond adornment. Success and failure are matters of timing, subject to constraints and beyond force. Lü Shang was not dull in youth nor wise in old age—yet he cast his plain silk and met his moment. Han Xin was not timid at first nor brave at last—yet he rose from dire straits to greatness.\n\nOpuzi says: The galloping steed cannot retrieve past errors; a thousand gold pieces cannot redeem a single flaw in speech. Thus, those who broadly bestow would do better to guard their defenses; those who diligently seek would do better to temper their words.\n\nOpuzi says: The stalwart man loves his state as his family and serves his lord as his kin—thus, disloyal acts do not arise, and his guilt is none. The benevolent man regards others as himself and treats the distant as the near—thus, unforgiving resentment does not arise, and his responsibility is none.\n\nOpuzi says: If dark ice does not form and white snow does not accumulate, the luxuriance of the green pine is not revealed. If custom does not decay and moral instruction does not decline, the purity of unsullied conduct is not distinguished. Only in a perilous state does one sink into obscurity—thus, Zhuang Zun and Lai Xi upheld their lofty disdain for honor. Only in chaotic times does one suffer hunger and cold—thus, Zeng Shen and Lie Yukou spread their renown for forgetting wealth.\n\nOpuzi says: Heaven dwells on high yet gazes below—thus, its net, though sparse, does not leak. The spirit is luminous and upright—thus, its Way rewards the true and punishes the false. Therefore, when kindness and harmony spread through the Nine Regions, the seven luminaries find their place in the boundless sky. When cruelty and harm appear among creatures, the two qi err in the four seasons.\n\nOpuzi says: Heaven’s order holds boundless honor; human rank holds no nobility that violates virtue. Thus, though Confucius was but a commoner, he received sacrifices for a hundred generations. Though Xin and Gui were emperors, their servants would not deign to compare themselves to them. The older Shang Yang grew, the humbler his station, yet the greater his fame. The more illustrious Jie and Zhou’s reigns became, the more their slander grew. Thus, the life of the King of Qi does not match the tomb of Liu Xuan; the palace of the King of Qin does not equal the lane of Zheng Kangcheng.\n\nOpuzi says: Echoes cannot exist without form and sound to manifest them; blessings cannot be summoned without virtue to attract them. Thus, when Yao governed for over seventy years, only then did auspicious stars radiate. When Yang Gong accumulated virtue into old age, only then did golden rain fall. The distant traveler arrives late; the belated benefactor’s recompense is slow.\n\nOpuzi says: When principle is exhausted, one cannot demand excess; when a single attainment is reached, one cannot seek universal aid. Thus, the last ripples of a great wave cannot stir duckweed; the aftermath of a fierce wind cannot lift light dust. The residual force of a powerful crossbow cannot pierce mist; the fading glow of the setting sun cannot illuminate the eastern mountains.\n\nOpuzi says: Though the celestial bodies may dim, they cannot be compared to the steadfast radiance of fireflies and candles. Though the Yellow River may be turbid, it cannot be likened to the clarity of ponds and streams. Though mountains may crumble, they remain loftier than mounds; though tigers may grow lean, they remain fiercer than jackals.\n\nOpuzi says: Had Shennong not suffered nine illnesses, the Way of the Four Classics would not have been bequeathed. Had Yu not endured calloused hands and feet, the blessings of the dark jade tablet would not have gathered. Thus, long suffering is the root of profound joy; brief toil is the beginning of lasting ease.\n\nOpuzi says: Though the golden hook and cassia bait be precious, they cannot restrain the depths of the nine abysses. Though illustrious favor and abundant emoluments be noble, they cannot attract the reclusive man of no desires. Thus, by the Lüliang cliffs dwells a man of lofty stance; by the river’s edge, people ceaselessly chant the *Fatan*. Jade and silk gather in vain at the lane of Master Ziling; empty carriages return in vain from the gate of Xu You.\n\nOpuzi says: Perception and hearing differ; loves and hates are hard to share. Birds, seeing Xishi, take flight in alarm; fish and turtles, hearing the *Jiushao*, sink deep. Thus, the splendor of court robes cannot please the eyes of the naked land; the pure notes of water-chestnut songs cannot delight the ears of the Chu exile. The benevolence of Gugong cannot enlighten the land-greedy Di; the eloquence of Duanmu cannot free the horse-tethering servant.",
      "overlap_context": " with fiefdoms, will not betray his nature to follow the times—how could he tread crooked paths to ingratiate himself?\n\nOpuzi says: The crashing thunder cannot produce sound in the deaf man’s ear; the radiant sun, though it illumines the sky, cannot bend its light into a dark ravine. The bitter cold of solid ice cannot wither the winter-blooming flower; the scorching wind, though it melts stone, cannot topple the trees of Xiaoqiu. Thus, even the highest virtue has that which it cannot transform.",

      "translated_text": "Opuzi says: The rituals of refined conduct are detested in lands of naked squatting; the craftsman’s plumb line is envied in the workshop of crooked timber. The gluttonous and ravenous despise the unblemished whiteness of plain silk; the cliquish and scheming resent the solitary loftiness of high integrity—just as the merchant hates a rival in profit, and the homely woman resents the beauty of a kingdom’s fairest.\n\nOpuzi says: When the noble man ascends, he advances the worthy and disperses emoluments; when the mediocre man gains power, he vaunts his rank and scorns the scholar. He bestows favors lavishly upon flatterers, employs talent only in petty kindnesses, shares no peace with the wise yet expects rescue in peril, partakes in no joy with the extraordinary yet desires solace in sorrow—like praying for rain from a famous mountain when wildfire already blazes across the sky, or felling trees in Min’s eastern forests when the floodwaters surge above the heavens. Is this not too late?\n\n**Chapter Forty: On Diction and Meaning**\n\nSome say: Heaven and earth’s roundness and squareness are not the work of compass and square; the Three Luminaries’ radiance is not the power of polish and ink. Spring blossoms’ brilliance is not the dye of gradual staining; orchid and angelica’s fragrance is not borrowed from external scent. Know then that the utmost truth values naturalness. Meaning is prized for its rarity of encounter; diction is beautified by its infrequency. Yet surveying past and present writers, few can bring forth untrammeled splendor at the tip of the brush. Most ladle from earlier words—why?\n\nOpuzi says: Pure tones are prized for their refined resonance; harmonious compositions are treasured for their clear distinctions. Thus, the eight sounds take different forms yet share the same tuning; embroidered patterns vary yet the five colors are balanced. Only because the crude has its master and the beautiful its sequence, the grand compositions have no fixed melody, and the great kitchen no set flavor. Timber piles up on Mounts Zi and Yu, yet without the master carpenter, no craft emerges; books are boundless, yet without exceptional talent, no essence is gathered. Why must one seek a thousand trees to build a great hall, or divine words to compose a chapter?\n\nOpuzi says: Talent has purity and turbidity; thought has length and brevity. Though all engage in writing, their levels differ by ten thousand grades. Some are vast and flowing yet lack depth; some grasp truth yet their words are dull. To speak against principle yet excel in craft is but a partial strength, not the talent of comprehensive mastery. Blind to self-assessment, forcing oneself to兼通, straying from one’s ability into alien tasks—how can one avoid ridicule?\n\nOpuzi says: The five flavors clash yet all are sweet; colors diverge yet all are lovely. Human nature loves what aligns with itself and scorns what differs. The style of writing is especially hard to judge. If it merely pleases the ear or suits the heart, few know the profound delight of the nine movements’ savor or the elegance of the *Ya* and *Song*. This is like tasting salt and plum’s saltiness and sourness yet not knowing the great broth’s absence of seasoning; admiring the lightness of floating feathers yet being blinded to the profundity of the abyss’s depths.\n\nThe exceptional and grandly untrammeled soar beyond the bounds of the mysterious and yellow; the constrained and cramped are fettered within cages. Wings have strength and weakness, so flight and perching have high and low; tracks have swiftness and slowness, so progress has far and near. The dull and sharp cannot be tuned with fixed pegs.\n\nWriting values richness and abundance—why must all praise be as one mouth? If it cannot rescue the world’s declining customs, stem the decay of the secluded path, clear the way for the doubtful, or relieve the poor’s want, it is no different from spring blossoms that do not serve as food, or orchids that do not save from icy cold. Ancient poems criticized faults, thus were beneficial and prized; modern poems are pure empty praise, thus harmful and cheap.\n\nOpuzi says: Writers each have their flaws. The deeply afflicted suffer from excessive analogies, redundant expansions, earnest amplifications—wishing to discard them yet pitying to do so, unaware they become burdensome. The shallowly afflicted suffer from beauty without substance, insufficient evidence, glossy skin yet weak bones. If ornate and resplendent, they outshine the seven luminaries; if profound and subtle, they rival the unfathomable abyss. Human affairs, however minute, are thoroughly permeated; the kingly Way, however vast, is fully prepared. Thus, though the body be lowly, the words are noble—through a thousand years, their glory grows ever brighter.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: Following the Root**\n\nOpuzi says: The mysterious, quiescent, and tranquil are the root of spirit and clarity. Yin and yang, softness and hardness are the root of the Two Modes. Towering peaks and deep valleys are the root of mountains and hills. Virtue, conduct, and learning are the root of the noble man. None can stand without a root. Thus, to reach the heights, one must strengthen the foundation; to flourish at the end, one must deepen the root. If village friends are not harmonious yet one busily seeks distant connections, if one’s official reputation is unestablished yet one craves extraordinary prominence—though one may briefly steal empty fame like frost-bitten flowers gleaming in the cold, they will wither before the morning ends. Though one may seize the great treasure unprepared, riding the dust like a flea on a galloping horse, few scales cling to soar on the waves—glancing back, one is already a withered stump on perilous land.\n\nThe sage and worthy diligently strive as if so, yet the shallow and careless scorn thus. With accumulated habit, one forgets the stench of the fish market; in the land of the naked, one does not notice the shame of exposed form. Unless one withdraws from the world without distress, equalizing success and failure, how can one abandon the near and easy to seek the distant and arduous?\n\nTo remedy this flaw, the method is no other: simply elevate the people from the cliffs and crags, employ talent without calculation.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: Responding to Ridicule**\n\nOpuzi says: A guest ridiculed me, saying: \"Master, you embrace the One, conceal your brilliance in the abyss of spirit, turn your back on the world, and wander alone—so remote, so serene. Your resolve is firm, yet hesitation does not arise in your heart; your course is set, yet worldly entanglements do not bind your breast. Boyang took the Dao and virtue as his head; Zhuangzi crowned his work with ‘Free and Easy Wandering.’ Thus, they established towering stature in the nine skies, spread fragrant glory without end. Yet you, Master, hold lofty principles and do not serve, yet write books on the lord’s Way and minister’s duty; do not associate with the world, yet compose critiques of customs and discourses on saving lives. You cherish your own limbs yet compile methods of warfare and defense; do not pursue advancement yet have essays on examining appointments and the rise and fall of careers. I am truly perplexed.\"\n\nOpuzi says: The great order of lord and minister is next to heaven and earth. To find joy in the Dao, whether appearing or withdrawing, is one in intent—what does it matter? The great man adapts to changing circumstances. Laozi practiced non-action, yet wrote his book; the Old Man of the Valley ultimately withdrew, yet composed his work—both discussed worldly affairs. Why must one hold office before speaking of its matters?\n\nIf the vessel is not fine jade or fragrant catalpa, it will not weep; if the essence is not a hidden dragon, wind and clouds will not gather. My talent is meager, my virtue slight, my abilities unfit for governance. Appearance and withdrawal share the same end; action and stillness are one in principle. Must one be a high official to discuss government affairs, or reside in office to discourse on order and chaos?",

      "translated_text": "Ever lamenting Zhuangzi’s words and deeds as self-aggrandizing shackles upon the world’s work: though dwelling in the Lacquer Garden, he indulged in wild talk, fond of painting demons and spirits, despising depictions of dogs and horses as too narrow, disparaging loyalty and integrity, slandering benevolence and righteousness. Such carving of tigers and painting of dragons could hardly summon wind and clouds; empty ledgers by the millions could not save the penniless child’s horse from hoof-skinning, nor could a table piled high with dishes fill an empty stomach.\n\nOthers may say: \"Your writings, sir, indicting customs and speaking bitter truths in forthright words, will only incur hatred from those in power and bring ostracism in your time—hardly the way to spread your name, gain renown, and be valued.\" I reply: A craftsman treasures a vessel for its usefulness in urgent need, not for adorning its outer form; a writer values words for their aid to teaching, not for currying favor and amassing praise. If one merely flatters, fawns, and conceals faults with empty praise, how can this correct errors, admonish transgressions, awaken the deluded, or remedy faults? Fearing few will harmonize, one abandons the \"White Snow\" melody; dreading hard sales, one cheapens the \"Liancheng\" gem. I seek nothing from this. Not that I cannot string together florid phrases to please, nor that I do not know forthright words often bring trouble—yet I cannot bear to betray my feelings, bend my brush, or mingle false with true. I wish only for heart and mouth to align, and to feel no shame before the wise who may come after. Prosperity and adversity are fated; success and obstruction are left to Heaven. Why must one’s conduct and words bring glory in one’s own time?\n\nThe noble man, when opening his mouth or moving his brush, must guard against delusion and obscurity, rectify the inclination to echo others’ errors, and grind away the darkness of evasive obscurantism. Yet those who write books merely adorn and play with florid phrases, flaunting abstruse and impractical words, stringing together unverifiable and useless expressions, crafting ornate and empty beauties—such works resemble the \"hard and white\" debates of Gongsun Long or the \"punishments and names\" discourses of the Legalists. Though they may encompass heaven and earth, penetrate the infinitesimal, untie linked rings, separate the inseparable, make bird shadows move not, give feet to chicken eggs, turn dogs into sheep, or speak of giant turtles and long snakes, they merely display cleverness and parade marvels to deceive the vulgar—what difference is there from painting granaries to stave off hunger, gazing at the Milky Way to quench thirst, praising the jade of Kun Mountain to relieve Yuan Xian’s poverty, or perusing a pharmacopeia to cure a critical illness? Mozi carved a wooden rooster to move Heaven, yet it was no match for a three-inch axle pin; Guan Qing cast a golden image of a fine steed, yet it was no match for a nag’s practical use. Lofty words that soar to autumn skies yet cannot be applied—Confucius would not exchange them for his own.\n\n**Chapter 43: Obscuring Analogies**\n\nI have always held Wang Zhongren’s *Lunheng*, with its eighty-odd chapters, to be the crown of extraordinary talent. A fellow student, Lu Sheng, challenged me, saying: \"Jade is prized for its rarity, gravel despised for its abundance. Thus, Fu Xi’s trigrams numbered fewer than ten yet embraced the Two Modes; Laozi’s words did not exceed ten thousand yet fully expounded the Dao and virtue. Wang Chong’s writings fill boxes and pile up scrolls, now entering, now exiting, now Confucian, now Mohist, with words strung together and meanings not always fine—such are the weeds of the marshlands, not to be compared with the millet and sorghum of measured steps.\"\n\nI replied: Those who create are called sages; those who transmit are called worthies. You see only the ranks of transmission and creation but have not heard of limits on their quantity. You, sir, are like one who hides in a burrow’s dimness, unaware of the boundlessness of the Eight Extremities; who clings to the glow of a lamp or candle, ignorant of the brilliance of the Three Lights; who swims in a shallow, stagnant pool, oblivious to the vastness of the Southern Sea; who is mired in the lowly mound of an anthill, unenlightened by the towering majesty of Mount Song. Heaven and Earth are called great because they embrace the Eight Wastes, vast and boundless; mountains and seas are called rich because they encompass vast expanses, containing all manner of things. If, as you elegantly argue, fewness is prized and abundance despised, then the vault of heaven, though vast and all-embracing, would not be valued for its thick bearing.\n\nIn a foot of water, there are no leviathans; on a handspan’s branch, no wings that brush the sky; atop an anthill, no forests of Fusang; in a stagnant puddle, no floods that rise above hills. The giant turtle’s head crowns Yingzhou; flying waves soar above Fangzhang; the great peach rests upon a measuring rope; the Jianmu tree towers over Duguang; the giant kun swims across the heavenly pond; the roc soars to the clouds. Moreover, thunder’s roar cannot refine its sound; the Yellow River’s surge cannot confine its flow; the swiftest steed cannot catch its tracks; the great swan cannot lower its flight. Thick clouds bring fierce rain; a strong bow sends arrows far. Wang Sheng, learned and talented, how could you not grasp this?\n\nYou say jade is prized for its scarcity and stone despised for its abundance. Yet beneath the dark gardens, atop the thorny peaks, in the marshes of the Nine [ ], in the abysses of Zhefang, jade and pearls pile into mountains, night-luminous gems blaze to the heavens—are these not fine? You cite Fu Xi’s few writings, yet the Duke of Zhou, following the *Great Change*, added rites and music; Confucius, composing the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, appended ten chapters—should they be demoted for exceeding Fu Xi and Laozi? Few words fail to encompass the ultimate principle; sparse phrases cannot fully express the myriad affairs. Thus, one must accumulate chapters and volumes to raise the guiding threads.\n\nThe sun and moon ascend to illuminate day and night; the Five Materials arise with different uses; the hundred herbs flourish with varied effects; the four seasons cycle to complete the year’s work; the five colors gather to adorn brocade; the eight sounds harmonize to beautify the *Xiaoshao* melody; the myriad words converge to distinguish the arts and the Dao. Even with wealth piled like Taozhi’s, its use is scant—how is this different from Yuan Xian? To hold the measure of an uncarved block yet write in meager and crude terms—how does this differ from the petty and trivial?\n\nMusic is treasured by those who know it; books are transmitted by those who recognize them. The melodies of the blind musician Kuang may not be understood in his own time; lofty words and refined writings need not fear lack of appreciation or diminish their worth. Moreover, the depths of rivers and seas cannot be exhausted, yet this does not lessen their profundity; the crooked trees of the Five Peaks cannot be counted, yet this does not diminish their towering heights. Though the jade tablet of the Xia sovereign may have a flaw the size of a hair, its radiance and luster suffice to compensate. Though a work of tens of thousands of words may contain unadorned passages, its profound meanings and lofty principles suffice to cover them. Thus, the turbidity of the Four Seas does not compare to the clarity of a jar of water; the leanness of a giant elephant is not the same as the plumpness of a lamb.\n\nYou also criticize his writings for now entering, now exiting, now Confucian, now Mohist. Yet speech issues from the mouth, and writing is speech put to paper. If the brush should not record diverse matters, then discussions should always adhere to one thing. Formerly, when feudal lords sought counsel on governance or disciples asked about benevolence, Confucius answered each with different words, adapting his guidance to the matter at hand and the urgency of the time. This is like the myriad prescriptions for treating illness or the varying points for acupuncture and moxibustion—used to dispel cold with warmth, eliminate heat with cool, with the sole aim of saving lives and preserving bodies. How can one, like a traveler, follow a single road to Qi and Chu without changing course?",

      "translated_text": "The wealth of Tao Zhu and Bai Gui encompassed not one single commodity—such was their abundance. The creatures of Yunmeng and Mengzhu were myriad and diverse—such was their vastness. Thus, the *Honglie* of Huainan begins with \"Originating the Dao\" and \"Inaugurating Purity,\" yet also includes military strategy and the art of rulership. The writings of Zhuang Zhou treat life and death as one, yet also contain his awe for the sacrificial ox, his admiration for the phoenix, his plea for grain to relieve hunger. If one were to discard a text because its words are not uniform, it would be like treating a pearl in the eye by gouging out the eye, curing damp impediment by severing the foot, eradicating weeds by reaping the grain, or loathing withered branches by felling the tree.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: The Hundred Schools**\nGezhi Zi said: Though the words of the Hundred Schools are not all pure, refined, ornate, or profound, they are, without exception, the lodging of the heart and the concentrated thought of the talented. The orthodox classics are the deep sea of the Dao and virtue; the masters’ writings are the flowing streams that deepen them. Looking up and comparing them, they are like the auspicious stars that assist the Three Luminaries; looking down and measuring them, they are like the thickets that complement Mount Song. Yet scholars cling to a single discipline, wandering a well and neglecting the sea, stumbling in the mire and stagnating in unchanging困境. The masters’ writings draw from the vast and distant, the subtle and boundless, the unfathomable source, and spread forth inexhaustible currents. Their transformations are not bound by the compass and square of rules; their lateral connections do not sink into the crooked paths of deviance. Their style is lofty and severe, their edge difficult to exhaust. Those who favor only sour or sweet cannot appreciate their flavor; those whose thoughts are limited cannot discern their spirit. The ancients sighed at the rarity of talent, and so for a hundred generations, scholars have followed in one another’s footsteps. They do not discard the luminous jewel of night because uncut jade does not arise from the hills of Ban and Shang, nor do they abandon words that aid teaching because they do not issue from the gates of Zhou or Confucius. It is like those who carry water: though their vessels differ, their aim of extinguishing fire is the same. It is like acupuncture and moxibustion: though their techniques vary, their goal of curing illness is equal. Yet those of narrow vision cling to one thing and reject breadth, confusing their thoughts. They do not recognize that accumulating the smallest bits can equal the weight of mountains, or that gathering hundreds and thousands can reach the number of billions and trillions. They are bewildered by the trivialities of poetry and rhapsodies, yet overlook the profound and beautiful words of the masters. They invert truth and falsehood, mix jade with stone, equate grand music with the tunes of Sangjian, and rank dragon patterns with plain silk. How lamentable! How deplorable! And not just in one respect.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Literature and Conduct**\nSome say: Virtue and conduct are the root; literature is the branch. Thus, in the sequence of the Four Categories, literature does not occupy the highest place. Then writing on paper is but the dregs of lees, a thing to be transmitted no more than the straw dogs used in sacrifices or the distinctions of high and low—worthy of ridicule.\n\nGezhi Zi replied: One may discard the fish trap once the fish is caught, but before the fish is caught, one cannot do without the trap. One may abandon literature once virtue is realized, but before virtue is realized, one cannot do without literature. As for the elegance of brushstrokes, the resonance of rhythm, the skill in arranging words and comparing meanings, the beauty or ugliness of their sources and flows, the length or brevity of their reach, the depth or shallowness of their citations and allusions—their differences are so vast that even the space between heaven and a hair’s tip cannot illustrate their remoteness. Their mutual surpassing is so great that even the Three Luminaries shining together cannot compare to their magnitude or minuteness. The sharpness of Longyuan swords and the dullness of lead ingots cannot match their keenness or bluntness. The lightness of swan feathers and the weight of piled gold cannot compare to their lightness or heaviness. Yet vulgar scholars see only the ability to dip the brush and draw on paper, and so they lump them all together. This is why Bo Shi endlessly pondered Zhong Zi, and the craftsmen of Ying ceased wielding their axes. Those who carve and cut may stand shoulder to shoulder, yet Ban and Di alone hold the name of unmatched skill. Those who pluck the zither may be many, yet Kui and Xiang alone possess the title of pure sound. Among a thousand teams of horses in the stable, only Qiji has the price of surpassing the herd. Among ten thousand beauties, only Weishi has the allure that transcends the age. For they far surpass the multitude.\n\nMoreover, to say that literature is but the surplus of virtue and conduct, like ten feet being the surplus of a丈, is something I have never heard before. The Eight Trigrams arose from the flight of the hawk and falcon; the Six Jia emerged from the burden of the divine turtle. Where literature exists, though it may be noble, the root is not necessarily shallow, nor is it necessarily thin where it is base. It is like brocade and embroidery relying on plain silk, or pearls and jade resting on clams and stone. Clouds and rain arise from the smallest measure; rivers and seas begin with the tiniest span. If the principle is truly thus, then the refined discourse is flawed.\n\nIt is also said: The ascending dragon rises slowly, glancing back as it soars into the clouds. The sweating blood horse walks leisurely, breathing deeply as it covers a thousand *li*. Thus, the ant marvels at its ascent without steps; the slow and lame are astonished that it surpasses them without gradual progress. If one gallops within the bounds of poetry and discourse, or circles within the confines of a single classic, viewing the vast and extraordinary with common sentiment, measuring the boundless with a footrule, from childhood to gray hair, one will never attain it.\n\nMoreover,世俗 generally venerates antiquity and despises the present, respects what they have heard and disdains what they see. Though there may be a steed that chases the wind and leaves the dust behind, they still say it does not match the horses ridden by Bo Le. Though there may be uncut jade as bright as two cities at night, they still say it does not compare to the jade wept over by the jade appraiser of Chu. Though there may be a sword that can sever a horse’s leg or carve a cicada, they still say it does not match the swords forged by Ou Ye. Though there may be medicine that revives the withered and restores the rotten, they still say it does not compare to the remedies compounded by He and Que. Though there may be a scholar who surpasses the crowd and walks alone, they still say he does not measure up to the ancients.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: Zheng and Guo**\nGezhi Zi said: Ji Sheng believed that Guo Linzhong of Taiyuan ultimately declined the command of the Three Dukes. His learning was all-encompassing, and his name was weighty in past ages. Moreover, he was skilled in discerning others—one who knows others is wise, and thus he was a vessel second only to the sages. Yet in a declining age, he was anxious and restless, never at ease in his seat, his ambition set on correcting disorder and practicing the Dao, much like Confucius.\n\nI replied: Wisdom or its absence hinges on a single word. Is the flaw in the pivot of the mechanism not enough to cause chaos? Bai Gui foolishly granted him the evaluation of being second only to the sages—this is not easily conceded. What is meant by \"second only to the sages\" is one who embodies the complete model and guards against the world, peerless and unmatched, with no room for comparison between them and Zhou or Confucius. How could such a person be worthy of this rank? Linzhong was outstanding, surpassing his time, his discernment clear and penetrating. Compared to ordinary people, the discussion naturally elevates him, but in reality, he still falls short. This man had eloquence, bearing, and the ability to hold his own, and he was adept at seizing opportunities. Moreover, those fond of meddling acted as his wings, spreading his reputation in all directions. Thus, he was able to leverage this and be esteemed in a chaotic age, praised by those who listen without verifying. When he bestowed a single word of praise, it was weightier than a thousand gold pieces. Wherever he traveled, the worthy and the foolish alike were swept up in his wake, calling it the descent of dragons and phoenixes, the emergence of rare omens.",
      "overlap_context": "ht counsel on governance or disciples asked about benevolence, Confucius answered each with different words, adapting his guidance to the matter at hand and the urgency of the time. This is like the myriad prescriptions for treating illness or the varying points for acupuncture and moxibustion—used to dispel cold with warmth, eliminate heat with cool, with the sole aim of saving lives and preserving bodies. How can one, like a traveler, follow a single road to Qi and Chu without changing course?",

      "translated_text": "When he spoke, his lingering tones became models to emulate; when he moved, his footprints became patterns to imitate—one might call him skilled at striking the great drum and worthy to raise high the sun and moon. Yet this was no true reclusion. For when he wished to stand in court, the age was in great chaos; when he wished to lie low, he found confinement unbearable. If he leapt forth, he feared calamity; if he withdrew, he found no peace. Thus he wavered, now plump, now gaunt, while the world pursued his bloom and never probed its root, admired his form and never grasped his spirit. So when his bamboo hat rotted in the rain, others still took it as a model, blind to its flaws—all was illusion. The common folk chased his reputation to such an extent that though flaws were plain, none dared point them out.\n\nLinzhong’s learning touched many fields, and he was not without insight into others. Yet he lacked the clarity to avoid error in reality and was blind in self-assessment. When urged to take office, Linzhong replied: “By day I observe human affairs; by night I guard against celestial signs. What Heaven has cast aside cannot be upheld. Now the fortune lies in the hexagram *Bright Obscurity*, in the position *Do Not Act*—a time for lingering in reclusion, not for the moment when Heaven favors public service. Even on dry land I fear the surging sea will overflow and I become its fish—how then could I dare face the gale and ride the rushing waves?”",

      "translated_text": "Better the mountain caves where spirit finds repose and heart delights in ease—like Pengzu, carefree, drifting, passing the years in leisure. By his own words, Linzhong knew the Han could not be saved, nor was it within his power to remedy; this much he discerned clearly. He should have looked up to the heights of Shang and Luo, looked down to the expanse of the Five Lakes, pursued Master Chao to the towering peaks, sought the Fisherman on the blue-green waves. If he could not bind his steps to the mountain recluses and depart alone, then he should have veiled his light in the deep pools, sheathed his scales, sealed his words in silence. Yet instead, he journeyed from west to east, his mat never warmed, yearning to emulate the sorrowful deeds of Confucius and Mozi. The noble man who grieves for the world wanders the four quarters—yet even recluses mocked and censured him.\n\nLinzhong’s talent was not of the moment, his vessel not peerless. In public service, he could not pacify the ruler or govern the people, transform customs or reform mores. In private, he could not exhaust his brush in writing or trace the Six Arts, yet he flaunted himself, overstepping all bounds. His fame blazed, his renown flourished, and he reaped no small reward. Yet in the end, he advanced without aiding order or chaos, and in retreat left no mark upon bamboo and silk. Observe his rise and fall, his melting like ice, his withering like grass—he differed not from the common man. For no reason, he plunged into the waves, cast himself into the dust, gathered in the capital, mingled with the noble and powerful. Wheels overturned, defenses crumbled, and he had no leisure to rest. Thus his reputation spread like wildfire, the people of Qin and Hu flocked to him, lanes filled with crimson-wheeled carriages, halls lined with scarlet-gowned guests. Chariots crowded the streets, memorials piled high—truly he was a knight-errant, not one who fit the measure of reclusion.\n\nIn an age of the Dao, one who reached such a state would still not be counted among the ranks of the pure and lofty, nor numbered among the hidden worthies. How much less, then, in this time of peril and chaos, is he worthy of praise? Who would not say he was blind to the rise and fall of Heaven and man, deluded about his own strengths and weaknesses? In vain he turned from the path of tranquility and silence, achieving no benefit, yet escaping disaster—this was mere luck.\n\nTo take such a course and claim concern for the world and devotion to the state, aspiring to the likeness of the Uncrowned King, is like a lame man chasing a dragon steed, a sparrow pursuing the swan, a scorched cicada comparing itself to the roc, a shrew to the great elephant. Thus Linzhong may be said to possess talent that dazzles the world, but not the substance of steadfast integrity. He saw all things clearly, and when nearly called to great use, his outward brilliance flared while his inner spirit was hollow, unable to bear the strain. His words and deeds clashed, his mouth spoke of quiet retreat while his heart craved glory and profit. He was no bird nesting in the mystic gardens, no hidden spirit in the ninefold abyss.\n\nTo praise oneself, to advertise one’s own worth—these are the shameful acts of scholars and women. Knowing the impossible, he still imitated the ancients, aspiring to the vessel of a near-sage—where was his stability? Though he spoke of knowing others, such discernment was difficult even for Yao and Shun, a vexation even to Confucius. One whose clarity rivals the sun and moon, who traces beginnings and sees ends, may still err and not always hit the mark—how much more so for Linzhong, whose light was but a flickering candle, his understanding half-right, half-wrong? Yet this was no small achievement.\n\nThus his name weighed heavily in his time, his praises resounded long after his death. What he gained, the world transmitted; what he lost, none recognized. Though he did somewhat sift the nameless scholars from the wilds, point to uncut jade in the hills, he could not advance the loyal and resolute to the court, stand against invaders on the frontier, relieve the desperate from their plight, or break the schemes of traitors in their pursuit. Like Baozi recommending Guan, like Zhong’s promotion of Rangju, Linzhong’s name shook the court, his reputation commanded respect in his day. The high ministers of the three and nine ranks all revered him, his strength could lift talent, his words could raise the stagnant. Yet he only nursed his illness in the capital, gathered guests, and made no effort to mend the crumbling state. He knew men but would not recommend them—what difference is there between this and recognizing fertile soil fit for fine crops, straight timber fit for beams and pillars, yet never plowing to sow good grain, never felling to build the frame? How does this relieve famine? How does it shelter the homeless?\n\nHis refusal of office was indeed a lofty principle; his ceaseless rushing about was also his affliction. Jisheng once said: “In life, Linzhong was a model for his age; in death, his fragrant legacy endures. No great scholar or fine gentleman has ever pointed out his flaws—why then do I alone criticize him? Will I not be ridiculed by future generations?” The Master of Embracing Simplicity replied: “Why should this be so? If my words are just, let them be passed to posterity. Why should I fear the lack of agreement from those who come after? Moreover, many former worthies have also criticized him—only the imperial edicts praised him excessively.”\n\nThus the Grand Tutor Zhuge Yuansun also said: “Linzhong concealed himself but did not cultivate true reclusion; his emergence did not benefit the times. In truth, he sought only to spread his name and nurture his reputation. Street gossip and alley chatter took his criticisms of the court as eloquence, his slander of governance as loftiness. The vulgar prized him, flocking to him like Guo Jie and Yuan She in former times.”\n\nLater scholars, drawn by his fame, could not examine him by the classics of the sage kings or measure him against the conduct of the ancient worthies. Bewitched by his flowery reputation, they competed to take him as their standard, learning from him as if they could not keep up, speaking of him until their ears were full. Even men of middling ability did not perceive the truth—how could the young and ignorant know? The Prefect of Lingling, Yin Bojing, a man of towering talent and resolute judgment, also said: “Linzhong entered the company of generals and ministers, traveled among the feudal lords, elevated private discourse to sway the masses, and wielded influence in the court. What he desired spread like wind and rain, changing prices and altering postures; what he despised was crushed and sunk. Scholars disdained him, and he broke the reputation of the so-called worthy. In times of chaos, to hide and conceal one’s light is not far from the mark.”\n\nThe noble man practices the Dao to aid his ruler and rectify customs. At that time, the ruler could not be aided, customs could not be rectified. Linzhong circled in pure discourse among the lanes and alleys, yet this did nothing to halt the decline of the world or relieve the suffering of the people. The former Gentleman of the Secretariat, Zhou Gongyuan, a man of heroic stature and renowned learning, also said: “To encounter order and assist it is called delighting in the Dao; to meet chaos and save it is called grieving for the Dao; when chaos cannot be saved and one withdraws, this is called guarding the Dao. Yu Shun delighted in the Dao; Confucius grieved for the Dao; Boyi guarded the Dao.”",

      "translated_text": "In the declining years of the Han, as the world teetered and affairs turned to socializing, Linzhong ought to have roused himself with an empty heart, seeking like-minded noble men to jointly correct and rectify the age. Yet he remained aloof, a lone hero—hardly the proper way to save the world. At that time, even the eunuchs treated their livestock as kin. Though men like Chen Fan and Dou Wu, who held the highest offices as ministers and governors, all revered Linzhong and trusted his judgments of right and wrong, could one not have hoped that he might aid the imperiled and reform customs? Yet Linzhong neither recommended men of action to bring the slightest benefit nor fled into reclusion. Thus, when compared to those like Xu You and Chao Fu, who abandoned their posts to await worthy guests, he was likened to the Duke of Zhou, who nurtured disciples; when avoiding service, he was equated with Confucius; when forsaking kin to rely on the powerful, he was matched with Ziyou and Zixia. Hence, the world confused name and reality, and great disorder grew ever worse.\n\nIf one claims Linzhong was ignorant, how could he be called wise? If he knew yet did not change, how could he be said to grieve for the Dao? In ancient times, the Four Greybeards resembled the Duke of Zhou but could not become him; now, Linzhong resembled Confucius but could not be him. Thereupon, one who questioned this sighed and said: “Then this man was merely one who fled chaos, not a lofty hermit of complete reclusion.”\n\n**“Critique of Mi Heng” (Chapter 47)**\nThe *Baopuzi* states: At the end of the Han, there was a man named Mi Heng, twenty-three years of age. Kong Wenju, though past fifty, held a high rank among the Nine Ministers and was renowned for his literary talent, yet he befriended Heng while the latter was still a commoner. He even memorialized the Han court, recommending that Heng be appointed directly to the post of Gentleman of the Palace. He declared: “When mountains give birth to spirits, extraordinary men emerge together. Whatever I see once, I can recite from memory; whatever I hear in passing, I never forget. My nature aligns with the Dao, my thoughts are as if divine.” Such was his praise of Heng.\n\nHeng traveled to Xuchang, where from the highest ministers and nobles to the worthies of the realm, none escaped his scorn. He never addressed them by their titles, calling them instead “Uncle So-and-so,” or by their surnames, as one would a child. He called Kong Rong “Big Boy” and Yang Xiu “Little Boy.” Only Xun Yu was deemed barely worth speaking to; beyond him, all were mere wooden puppets or clay effigies—lifeless things, no more than wine jars or rice sacks.\n\nOnce, at an assembly of high officials, Heng suddenly frowned, his expression mournful, sighing with sorrow and indignation. Someone mocked him, saying: “Here we have a gathering of heroes—why this lament?” Heng glanced around at the crowd and replied: “Amid these rows of corpses and coffins, how can a humane man not grieve?”\n\nCao Cao once gnashed his teeth, wishing to kill him, but Heng had committed no capital offense under the Eight Laws, and Cao feared the reputation of slaying a scholar. Thus, he demoted Heng to the post of drumming officer. Heng showed no remorse or shame; instead, he tied ox horns to a pillar and played them with his mouth, producing strange sounds while beating the drum. Those who heard could not tell it was the work of one man.\n\nHis criticisms grew even sharper, utterly without restraint. Soon after, he fled and sought refuge with Liu Biao, Governor of Jingzhou. Biao wished to draft a letter to Sun Quan, who had already consolidated power in the southeast with a million armored troops, proposing an alliance to resist the Central States. He had his scholars compose the letter, but none could capture his intent. Finally, he showed it to Heng. Heng read it and said: “This is fit only for Sun’s lackeys, the boys who hold his blades. If Zhang Zibu were to see it, he would be deeply shamed.” With that, he crumpled the paper and threw it to the ground. Biao, dismayed, looked at him strangely and said: “Is there nothing you can do?” He regretted not having Heng tend the fields instead.\n\nHeng asked for paper and brush, then rewrote the letter. The others had produced over ten drafts, all of which Heng merely glanced at before memorizing them. When he finished writing, he returned the draft to Biao. Biao compared it to the originals—there was not a single error. All were astonished. Biao then asked Heng to compose another, and Heng did so without pause, his hand never stopping. Biao found it excellent and put it to use.\n\nHeng’s arrogance grew ever more extreme. The gentry of the province all despised him, and even Biao could no longer endure him and wished to kill him. Someone admonished him: “Cao Cao is known for his severity, yet he could tolerate Heng, who has but a slight reputation. If you kill him now, no wandering scholar in the world will ever set foot in Jing and Chu again.” Thus, Biao sent him away.\n\nHeng fled to Xiakou and took refuge with General Huang Zu, who treated him as an honored guest. Huang Zu’s eldest son, Huang She, traveled with Heng. Passing a tomb, they read the inscription on its stele. After a single glance, they moved on. Later, She said: “The stele inscription we saw earlier was excellent. It’s a pity I didn’t copy it down.” Heng replied: “You only remember the name. I recall the whole thing after one reading.” He then wrote it from memory. At the end, one character was missing due to damage to the stone. Heng supplied half the character and said: “I suspect this should be such-and-such a word, though I cannot be certain.”\n\nThroughout his life, Heng spoke and acted with disdain for others, yet secretly longed for glory and renown. Thus, though he soared through the phoenix groves, he could not hide in the reeds and brambles. His self-cultivation was flawed, his critiques misguided, and he failed to recognize his errors. Hence, he opened his mouth only to be hated, took a step only to invite disaster. With such talents, how could he have found a place in the world or met a natural end? Like a crow’s caw or a fox’s howl, though men dislike the sound, the creatures do not change their cries—what good did it do? The sea of men in Xuchang, with Wenju as his patron and bearing the weight of his support, could not make him content—this much was clear. He was like a man with a fatal illness, beyond even the skill of the great physician Bian Que; like rotten wood or leaden darts, beyond the craft of Lu Ban or Ou Ye. Yet he fled again to the lands of Jing and Chu, where he met his doom—this was the consequence of Heng’s blindness. He sought what he could not attain, not that he could have attained it and failed to use it.\n\nAlas! Let men of talent take warning!\n\n**“The Disciple Asks”** said: “What perplexes me is Mi Heng’s empty reputation.”\n**“You have spoken of his true flaws,”** I replied. “How could I not awaken to your guiding words, casting aside my staff to follow the right path?”\n\n**“Refuting Bao” (Chapter 48)**\nBao Jingyan revered the books of Laozi and Zhuangzi and excelled in incisive debate. He believed that the ancients lived without rulers, a state superior to the present age. Thus, he wrote in his treatise: The Confucians say, “Heaven gave birth to the common people and set up rulers for them.” Could it be that august Heaven spoke so earnestly? Was this not merely an excuse for those who desired it?\n\nWhen the strong oppress the weak, the weak submit. When the cunning deceive the foolish, the foolish serve them.",

      "translated_text": "The subjugation of the weak gives rise to the Way of ruler and minister; the servitude of the foolish establishes control over the few in strength. Thus, the bonds of servitude and the toil of labor arise from contention over strength and the comparison of wit and folly. Yet august Heaven remains truly uninvolved.\n\nIn the primal chaos, namelessness was prized; all living things rejoiced in attaining their desires. Thus, to strip the bark from pillars and carve lacquer was not the wish of the wood; to pluck the kingfisher’s feathers and rend the halcyon’s plumes was not the desire of the bird. To tighten the reins and force the bit was not the nature of the horse; to bear the yoke and haul heavy loads was not the joy of the ox. The sprouts of deceit and cunning, the exertion of force contrary to truth, the felling of roots to adorn the useless, the capture of flying birds for ornate display—piercing the noses of creatures born whole, binding the feet of those meant to roam free—these were never the intent of the myriad things born together.\n\nTo toil the common people in order to nourish those in office, where the noble enjoy ample stipends while the people suffer hardship—if one could escape death and gain life, the joy would be boundless, yet this is not as good as never having faced death at all. To decline rank and refuse stipends in pursuit of empty fame is not as good as never having had to decline them. When the world is in rebellion and chaos, loyalty and righteousness become manifest; when the six relations are in discord, filial piety and kindness are extolled.\n\nIn the distant past, there were no rulers, no ministers. People drank from wells they dug, ate from fields they tilled, rose with the sun and rested with its setting. They drifted without attachment, content in their ease, neither competing nor scheming, knowing neither glory nor shame. Mountains had no paths, marshes no boats or bridges; rivers and valleys were uncrossed, so none encroached upon another. The multitudes did not gather, so none attacked one another. High nests were left unplundered, deep pools unscooped. Phoenixes and simurghs nested in courtyards; dragons and scaled creatures swam in garden ponds. One could tread upon hungry tigers, grasp vipers and adders, wade through marshes without startling gulls, or enter forests without alarming foxes. Ambition and profit did not arise; calamity and chaos did not occur. Weapons were unused; walls and moats were unbuilt. The myriad things were profoundly united, forgetting one another in the Dao. Plagues did not spread; the people lived out their years. Purity dwelled in their hearts; scheming minds did not stir. They fed at ease, drummed their bellies, and wandered freely. Their words were unadorned; their conduct unembellished.\n\nHow could they amass wealth to seize the people’s property? How could they impose harsh punishments to create pits and snares? Yet when the age descended into decline, wit and cunning arose, virtue and power waned, and hierarchy was established. The rites of ascent and descent, of increase and decrease, were elaborated; the robes of dark and yellow silk, the caps of office, were adorned. Towers soared into the clouds; vermilion and green were applied to rafters and beams. They dredged the steepest peaks for treasure, dived into the deepest pools for pearls, and amassed jade like forests—yet this was not enough to exhaust their extravagance. They piled gold into mountains—yet this was not enough to satisfy their expenses. Indulging in excess and dissipation, they betrayed the great origin of their beginnings. The farther they strayed from antiquity, the more they turned from simplicity, increasing their veneration of the worthy, so the people contended for fame; prizing wealth, so thieves and bandits arose. When desires became visible, the true and upright heart was disturbed; when power and profit were displayed, the path of robbery and plunder opened. The forging of sharp weapons prolonged the suffering of invasion and division. They feared their crossbows were not strong enough, their armor not sturdy enough, their spears not sharp enough, their shields not thick enough. If there were no oppression, all these could be discarded.\n\nThus it is said: If white jade is not shattered, how can it become a ritual scepter? If the Dao is not abandoned, why would one seek benevolence and righteousness? It was the likes of Jie and Zhou who roasted men alive, minced remonstrators into jerky, pickled feudal lords, split open hearts, and shattered shins, exhausting the evils of arrogance and excess, employing the cruelty of roasting and branding. Had these men remained commoners, their natures might have curbed their extravagance—how could they have inflicted such atrocities? Their ability to slaughter and carve up the world arose from their position as rulers, which allowed them to indulge their will.\n\nOnce ruler and minister were established, wickedness multiplied daily—yet one still wishes to raise one’s arms in defiance? In shackles and fetters, one suffers amidst the bitterness of the road; the lord trembles in fear within the ancestral temple; the common people are tormented in their hardship. To restrain them with ritual and measure, to order them with punishments—this is like trying to dam a source that floods the heavens or stem an unfathomable current by plugging it with a handful of earth or blocking it with one’s palm.\n\n**The Master Who Embraces Simplicity** replied: I have heard that when the primordial obscurity parted, the turbid descended and the pure ascended; the vault of Heaven arched above, the expanse of Earth settled below. Heaven and Earth took their places, and from their forms, the distant was drawn: thus, Heaven is honored and Earth is lowly, making manifest the structure of human relations. From the near, drawn from the body: the head and limbs thus illustrate the order of ruler and minister. The pattern of hierarchy has its origins here.\n\nAs for the Great Ultimate in its undifferentiated chaos, before the Two Modes had form—this was not as good as when the dark and yellow were sundered, the Seven Luminaries hung in the sky, yin and yang shaped the myriad things, and all were distinct. From this, we know that birds gather and beasts scatter, nesting in trees and burrowing in dens, eating flesh and blood, wearing grass and straw. Within, there were no distinctions of the six relations; without, no ranks of hierarchy. This was not as good as sheltering in spacious halls, enjoying fine grains and delicacies, wearing embroidered robes and silken garments, facing winter and summer with ease, governing the world with wise rulers, and employing skilled artisans. Offices were established, duties divided, and the cosmos was harmonious.\n\nWhen noble and base were distinguished, people yearned for reward and feared punishment; when power was equal and strength balanced, contention and plunder knew no fear. Thus, sages arose, receiving their mandate from Heaven. Some wove nets to hunt and fish; some observed the stars to drill fire; some tasted plants to select grains; some built shelters to shield from the elements. They prepared things for use, removed harm, and brought forth benefit. The people rejoiced and followed them, honoring them as rulers—thus the Way of ruler and minister was born.\n\nHow could there be deceit of the foolish or oppression of the weak? The Three August Ones and Five Emperors succeeded one another, and the teachings of the Dao flourished. They distinguished right from wrong, encouraged virtue and discouraged vice. Virtue was abundant, punishments were clear, and songs of praise arose. The great transformation was achieved; the steps of the celestial ladder were level; the Seven Governors followed their courses. The phoenix sang in the morning sun; the qilin and unicorn appeared bearing auspicious signs. Dragons emerged from the rivers, spouting patterns; the sun’s elder displayed its radiance in the sky. The imperial wind spread across the nine regions; weapons were stored away in armories. Thus, ritual systems ensured the ruler’s peace, and punishments were set aside.\n\nAs for extravagance, dissipation, madness, and violence—do these necessarily arise from having rulers?",

      "translated_text": "Yet Master Bao alone cites the crimes of a declining age while ignoring the principles of perfect governance—why is this? Moreover, in remote antiquity, simplicity and plainness prevailed, for the people had not yet changed; their minds remained as unformed as those of children, free from scheming. This was not because they knew restraint but chose not to act, nor because they desired and yet endured. If person contended with person over the profits of wild grasses, if household strove with household over the lands of nests and dens, if above there were no officials to redress wrongs and below there were only factions bound by heavy oaths, then private strife would surpass public warfare, wooden clubs and stones would outdo halberds and shields, corpses would litter the fields, and blood would dye the roads crimson. Long without rulers, all living things would perish.\n\nAs for the taming of dragons and the domestication of phoenixes, the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* diagrams, the qilin bearing inscribed tablets on its back, the yellow fish surging in the waves, the red birds soaring to bestow teachings, or the triple convergence of whirlwinds—all these occurred in eras with rulers, not in times without kings. Such auspicious omens, pointing to the profoundest mysteries, either manifest the signs of dynastic revolution or reveal the flourishing of perfect governance.

      "translated_text": "If you esteem namelessness as the highest, then the Eight Trigrams ought not to have been drawn. Could Creation have erred, and Fuxi been benighted? The refined discourse of the ancients revered only spontaneity. Pray tell: to recognize the mother yet forget the father is the nature of all living things; prostration in reverence is but a late adornment of the world. Yet nature cannot be left to itself—one must honor the father; adornment cannot be abolished—one must perform obeisance. If you abandon both, how can a child find peace?\n\nIn ancient times, the living had no houses of timber, the dead no coffins for burial. Rivers lacked boats and oars, land lacked carriages and horses. People swallowed poison and perished, fell ill without medicine, and died unjustly without end. Later sages reformed these ways and bequeathed them to the people, whose descendants to this day rely on their beneficence. The benefits of ingenuity and craft are not easily undone. Now, if you were to dwell in the crudeness of nests and caves, cast the dead into the wilds, cross rivers by swimming, traverse mountains on foot bearing loads, discard cauldrons and tripods to eat raw and rank food, abandon needles and stone to suffer natural illness, clothe yourself in nakedness, take a woman as mate without matchmakers—would you not say this is impossible? How much more so, then, without a ruler?\n\nIf the people of high antiquity were like wood or stone, or like ice so pure it does not chill, or could go without food and not hunger, then perhaps it would suffice. But if the desires for clothing and food reside in their hearts, then what they contend over need not be gold or jade, nor need their competition be for glory or rank. Acorns and taro can provoke lawsuits; coarse greens and pulse suffice to incite plunder. The nature of desire sprouts at the moment of receiving qi; the inclination to favor oneself takes root at the formation of the body. Usurpation, murder, and annexation arise from nature itself. If this is so, how could order be maintained?\n\nWhen a wise king sits above, the feudal lords all follow his model, rising at dawn and retiring late, extending the hours of audience, welcoming criticism to correct faults, holding close advisors to account, heeding street gossip for self-examination, reflecting on missteps with evening trepidation. He spreads a cleansing wind to sweep away corruption, sharpens autumn’s severity to discipline all things. His laws are strict, his nets tightly woven: those who transgress are not spared. Executions punish minor crimes; the Nine Punishments chastise great rebels. Yet still he fears wolves blocking the path, laments the disorder of human relations, worries that the arrogation of power will bring ruin to families, and dreads treachery harming the state. Thus he deploys hawk-like officials to impeach wrongdoers, and tiger-like ministers to wield the rod at the four quarters. Were he to cease banishing and exiling the reckless and cunning, allowing them no fear, then Robber Zhi would rampage and plunder, while the good and innocent fold their hands and await disaster. With no lord to defend them, no borders to rely on, how could one hope that all families become Boyis and Liuxias? It would be like carrying a pig and wishing to remain unscented, or leaning on a river and hoping not to get wet; like driving a galloping horse without reins, or sailing a light boat without rudder or oar—how could it be possible?\n\nMaster Bao further objects: Heaven and Earth take their positions, the two qi shape all things. Delighting in yang, clouds take flight; favoring yin, rivers settle. Following softness and hardness, they complete their natures; adapting to the four seasons and eight nodes, they transform and generate, each attaching to what suits it—originally without distinction of high or low. Once ruler and minister are established, however, transformations multiply. When otters abound, fish are disturbed; when hawks proliferate, birds are thrown into chaos. When offices are set up, the common people are burdened; when offerings to superiors are lavish, the people below grow poor. Hoarding treasures, adorning palaces, feasting on lavish spreads, dressing in dragon-patterned robes, amassing idle women within and leaving many men widowed without—seeking rare jewels, prizing strange objects, crafting useless implements, indulging insatiable desires—neither ghosts nor spirits, whence comes the wealth to sustain this?\n\nWhen grain and silk accumulate, the people suffer cold and hunger; when the bureaucracy is fully staffed, resources are squandered on their upkeep. The palace guard consumes without labor; the people support idle hands. The masses lack clothing and food to sustain themselves—how much worse when taxes and corvées are heaped upon them? The people below cannot bear their fate, freezing and starving, violating the law in desperation. The king above labors in anxiety, his ministers below furrow their brows. Fearing calamity’s approach, dreading the failure of wisdom and courage, he offers generous ranks and heavy emoluments to entice them, fortifies walls and deepens moats to guard against treachery. Yet he does not realize that lavish rewards impoverish the people and make ministers arrogant, while fortified walls increase labor and sharpen the art of attack. Thus, scattering the gold of Lutai and distributing the grain of Juqiao brought universal joy—how much more so if one had never amassed gold or hoarded grain in the first place? Releasing oxen in Taolin, freeing horses on Huashan, sheathing shields and spears, storing bows and arrows—this was still deemed excessive. How much more so if one had never raised armies or waged war?\n\nThatched roofs and earthen steps, abandoning weaving to pluck mallows, using sacks as curtains, washing furs for bedding, concubines not wearing silk, horses not fed grain—frugality was taken as a model, a fine tale to tell. This is what Robber Zhi meant when he divided spoils and took the lesser share as deference, or what fish in a drying pool mean when they moisten one another with foam. If one’s person bears no public service, one’s family no tax burden, if one is content with one’s land and delights in one’s lot, if within one has enough for clothing and food, and without no strife for power or profit—then wielding a staff to rob and plunder is not human nature.\n\nThe teaching of symbolic punishments left the people with no crimes; yet the more laws were promulgated, the more thieves and bandits arose. Was it that they lacked avaricious natures while only the rulers were rapacious? No—when the state is tranquil, the people naturally align; when the people are weary and resentful, cunning and deceit arise. To leave things to nature is still to fear violence and oppression; to labor without rest, to seize without end, fields grow fallow, granaries empty, looms idle, food insufficient for the mouth, clothing inadequate for the body—how could one expect order to prevail?\n\nThus, efforts to avert disaster only deepen it; strict prohibitions fail to halt transgressions. Checkpoints and bridges are meant to prevent wrongdoing, yet crafty officials exploit them for mischief. Weights and measures are meant to detect fraud, yet the wicked use them to deceive. Great ministers are meant to shore up peril, yet treacherous ministers fear their lord’s safety is not imperiled. Arms and armor are meant to quell strife, yet bandits and rebels use them to foment it. All these are the consequences of having rulers.\n\nWhen the people see advantage, they contend for it. The wealthy and noble have much to gain. Even petty disputes among commoners are trivial, and the strength of individuals has its limits. Without territory to covet, cities to desire, gold or jewels to crave, or power to compete for, they cannot gather followers or command others. How can this compare to a king’s wrathful display, mustering armies and deploying troops, driving innocent people to attack blameless states, where corpses lie by the tens of thousands, blood flows to float the oars, and the land turns crimson? Wicked rulers have existed in every age, venting their cruelty and disordering the world. Within, no loyal and good men are spared; without, the common people lie exposed in death. Is this merely the harm of petty strife?\n\nAs for shifting filial piety to serve the lord, or replacing devotion to parents with loyalty—even without rulers, such distortions would still arise.",

Such auspicious omens, pointing to the profoundest mysteries, either manifest the signs of dynastic revolution or reveal the flourishing of perfect governance. If rulers were not aligned with the Will of Heaven, who would summon these propitious responses?\n\nIf you deem chaos and defense as beauty, then Heaven and Earth ought not to be divided.",

In ancient times, clothing sufficed to cover the body, yet now it is woven with dark silks, embroidered with intricate patterns, and draped in brocades, fine silks, and gauze.

How can one, because affairs have gone too far, entirely abolish them?\n\nIf the sage-kings Yao and Shun were on the throne, with Hou Ji and Yu assisting in governance—living in humble palaces, levying light taxes, and employing the people in due season—if they exalted the pure winds of frugality and strictly enforced prohibitions against extravagant feasts, honoring and elevating those who embraced simplicity and restraint while demoting and punishing those who disrupted customs and encroached upon the people, then songs of praise would arise and the common folk would live in peace.

      "translated_text": "The casting of gold into the mountains marked Yu’s abdication, just as the discarding of jade into the valleys, coarse food, and plain garments marked Shun’s vigil at the gatekeeper’s post—from this it may be known that they neither drained the deeps to carve pearls, nor split the crags to quarry jade, nor smelted cinnabar and lead ores, nor crossed the seas to rend kingfishers’ plumes, nor netted hawksbill in distant lands, nor dug pigments from the Min and Han rivers. When robes and insignia show no distinction, majesty and weight cannot be manifest; when names and ranks are not differentiated, rites and emblems lose their proper gradations. Thus the Duke of Zhou established the canons for distinguishing noble from base and high from low: in palaces and dwellings, the height was limited by the span of pounded-earth walls; in caps, canopies, banners, and flags, ornamentation followed regulated patterns; in carriages, robes, vessels, and utensils, quantities were fixed by statute; in kitchens and banquets, dishes adhered to prescribed standards; in years of famine or disaster, reductions and withdrawals were duly made. Insatiable desires do not belong to the discourse of the Daoist adept; to cite them as proof of Jie and Zhou’s crimes is insufficient to settle the judgment of refined debate.\n\nMaster Bao said: “When the ruler’s rear palace holds three thousand consorts, can this all be Heaven’s will?

      "translated_text": "Thus it serves to assist the six palaces in regulating yin and yang, to instruct and solemnify the ancestral temples, to serve the divine spirits, to uphold the great sacrifices, to don the dark-tasseled robes, and to broaden the paths of the royal lineage. Moreover, according to the *Records of the Nine Lands* in the Zhou canon and the geographical texts of the Han, the number of women in the realm exceeds that of men—how could the king’s consorts possibly crowd out those who ought to marry?\n\nDuke Ji of Zhou pondered this and seemed to have considered it carefully. The emperor leads the hundred officials in the *jie-tian* ritual; the empress and consorts of noble rank oversee weaving. Extending to the common folk, farming duties are limited, tillage is rewarded, and idleness is punished. A tithe is levied to supply public needs, households maintain reserves for defense, and the state stores nine years’ worth of provisions. Each follows the natural division of labor, none is deprived of their season, taxes are light, corvée labor is sparse, and the people suffer neither hunger nor cold. When clothing and food are sufficient, rites and deference arise.\n\nIn the eras of Emperors Wen and Jing, the people devoted themselves to farming, households were well-provided, and granaries overflowed with grain—so much that the red husks rotted beyond counting. Yet even then, scholars and commoners still dined on fine meats and rode in carriages drawn by oxen and horses. This was because taxation was moderate and did not deplete the people. In later ages, officials abandoned the system of tillage quotas, and private pursuits turned to frivolous trades. The way of growing grain narrowed while idle mouths multiplied, so that both high and low alike transgressed, and offenders abounded.\n\nMaster Bao thus blamed the ruler, but it would be better to criticize the excesses of conscription and selection, to censure the unreliability of farming quotas, to rebuke the three thousand who drink like oxen, and to reduce the land tax to a third or half. If only the rear palace adhered to the Zhou rites and taxes were not levied arbitrarily, this would suffice. Must there truly be no ruler?\n\nIf the ruler rises late even once, affairs will fall into disorder. When entering the forest without a forester, even the deer will elude you—how can this be sustained indefinitely? Without a guiding authority, the noble lose their model, the people achieve their desires, and even a loose net still catches some fish. Can there be no net at all?\n\nMaster Bao said: “For people to live, clothing and food are already burdensome. If one further imposes heavy taxes and labor services, hunger and cold will converge, and the people will be unable to endure their fate, leading them to defy the law and commit crimes.”\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity refuted this, saying: “The spider spins its web, yet fleas and lice do not starve. Human ingenuity harnesses the myriad things to feed mouths and clothe bodies—what hardship is there in this? The problem lies in the rich having no limit to their desires and the noble having boundless expenditures. How can one, for the sake of a single precaution, abandon governance entirely, fearing the cruelty of Jie and Zhou? To say there is taxation and labor service is to invite chaos—then I ask: in the age of peace under Yao and Shun, in the virtuous eras of the Three Dynasties, were there no taxes or labor services to support the ruler and ministers? Did the Son of Heaven and his officials plow the fields to sustain themselves?”\n\nMaster Bao then said: “The king treads as if over deep abysses and tiger tails, his peril beyond comparison. He sleeps lightly, rising before dawn, and eats only after the sun has declined—what cause has he to fear calamity?”\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity countered: “If a ruler truly acts thus, he is a sage-king. The true affliction of kings lies in arrogance and extravagance, in failing to employ the worthy and employing the unworthy. King Jie of Xia pointed to the sun and swore he would not perish; the First Emperor of Qin feared sharing a posthumous name with others, yet both brought ruin upon themselves and became laughingstocks for posterity. If a ruler fears danger, remains vigilant at dusk, broadly accepts admonitions, consults even the humble, nurtures the aged, and seeks counsel from the venerable—what worry is there of misjudgment? What peril is there that the hundred affairs will not prosper? Diligence orders the constant norms; laxity breeds villainy. How much worse, then, if there is no ruler at all—could there be no chaos?”\n\nMaster Bao said: “The king covets rare omens and lures distant lands, seeking to exalt his virtue and magnify his might, dazzling the un-subdued. What benefit is there to the common people in white pheasants or jade rings?”\n\nThe Master of Embracing Simplicity refuted this, saying: “When the king’s virtue reaches Heaven, there are celestial portents; when it reaches Earth, there are terrestrial responses. The radiant star scatters its light to aid the moon’s glow; the solar halo displays its hues to mark the sun’s path. Divine birds sing in the palace towers; golden images gleam upon the clear pools—were these brought about by humble words or lavish gifts? Wang Mang, treacherous and harboring malice, fabricated signs of peace to deceive the court and the realm, even sending envoys to foreign lands to present auspicious omens. Can this be taken as proof that all ancient omens were the same?\n\nSeeing a tail a fathom long, one knows the beast is not a handspan in size; observing fangs a cubit long, one knows the mouth is not an inch wide. Thus, the Queen Mother of the West sent envoys, proving her numinous transformation and boundless influence. The distant state of Yuechang, through repeated translations, came to offer tribute, showing that benevolence had reached even the remotest lands. Remote domains cannot be subdued by force; barbarians cannot be cowed by might. Without perfect governance, how could this be achieved?”",

      "translated_text": "Why, then, did Master Bao claim such things were of no use? The House of Zhou was not lacking in jade and thus needed the Queen Mother of the West’s ring to be deemed wealthy; nor was it sparing in its meals and so exhausted the pheasants of Yuechang to fill its kitchens. What made these gifts precious was that they signified the attainment of Great Peace—whereby the ruler above was free of harsh and oppressive governance. What could be more abundant than this? To say they were of no use or benefit to the people is to fail to see their profound source and vast import. Was not Master Bao’s remark fitting?\n\nMaster Bao said: “The sovereign fears unforeseen treachery and so fortifies the city walls in preparation.” The *Baopuzi* retorted: “The lords and kings set up barriers—what the *Great Change* values. Why, then, should fortified walls be criticized? When the Two Modes first unfolded and the myriad things were transformed and born, both deviance and rectitude came to be. The sage, knowing that guarding against villainy is natural and that the benighted masses are as hard to change as withered wood is to flourish under spring’s warmth or metal and stone to melt beneath the summer sun, took his model from the *Xikan* and prepared for what had not yet sprouted. With layered gates came the watchman’s clapper as a warning; with military governance came the suppression of violent intruders. Yet to seek their eradication—what principle justifies this? The rhinoceros’s horn, the phoenix’s spur—Heaven indeed bestows them, but must they be used daily?”",

Thus, the Queen Mother of the West sent envoys, proving her numinous transformation and boundless influence.

Remote domains cannot be subdued by force; barbarians cannot be cowed by might. Without perfect governance, how could this be achieved?”",

      "translated_text": "The wasp and scorpion bear venom to defend themselves; the clever bird carries reeds to shield against nets; the badger bends its burrow to guard against sudden assault; the water buffalo forms ranks to repel the ferocity of tigers and leopards. Yet Master Bao would cast aside armor and helmets to advance sharp blades, raze city walls to halt charging forces. If armor and helmets are discarded and sharp blades do not cease, if city walls are destroyed and charges still gather—even Gongshu Ban and Mo Di could not preserve themselves. How, then, shall our lives be secured?\n\nSome say: “If there are no coveted goods, even without fortified walls, enemies will not come.” Master Baopu replies: “Must coveted goods be gold or jade, the point of an awl or knife? The foolish masses contend over them. The great war of the Yue people arose from the unequal division of a python’s flesh; the rebellion of Wu and Chu was sparked by a single mulberry leaf. In times of famine, men devour one another. Yet in the past, bare-handed and barefoot, from afar like Fu Hou and Zigao, from near like Yu Gong, they probed the truth, weighed punishments, split hairs and shaved grains. Those condemned to execution swallowed their voices and sang of virtue; those mutilated by amputation or nose-cutting bore no grudge to their dying day—all this occurred not in a time without rulers.\n\nLong ago, when a widower dwelt in lowliness, the Four Peaks did not conceal him; when obscure worthies were sought, the finest talents were all raised. Some cast aside their butcher’s knives to enter the golden gates; some left their trowels and bricks to ascend jade halls; some abandoned their fodder and hay to become ministers and chancellors; some, fleeing for their lives, became supreme generals. Bo Liu avenged his foe; Xie Hu recommended his enemy; Fang Hui knocked his head to attract scholars; Qin Xi shattered his skull to advance the worthy. I ask: were these times without rulers?\n\nIt is further said: ‘Fields lie fallow, granaries stand empty—all because of rulers.’ But rulers are not the creeping weeds that choke the fields, nor are ministers the sparrows and rats that deplete the granaries. That fields lie fallow and granaries stand empty is ultimately due to calamitous fate—floods and droughts, epidemics and plagues—leading to famine and want. How can this be blamed on the levies and demands of governance?\n\nAmong the Eight Regulations, food is foremost, called the people’s Heaven. Hou Ji tilled the fields himself; the Yu sovereign plowed in person. In years of plenty, millet and rice abound; our granaries brim with grain. Canals are dug to drain alkaline soils, turning them into fertile fields. Shao Fu built the embankments of Yangling, piling grain like mountains; Shu Ao created the irrigation of Qisi, leaving households with rotting millet. Zhao Guo devised the triple-plow technique, enriching the lands west of the Pass; Ren Yan taught the people of Jiuzhen to farm, filling the bellies of the black-haired masses. Were these times without rulers?\n\n*Knowing When to Stop*, Forty-Ninth\nMaster Baopu says: “No misfortune is greater than insatiability; no blessing is richer than—”",

      "translated_text": "To know when to stop, to embrace sufficiency, and to dwell in emptiness—these are the calculations of preservation. Feasting in ease and abounding in fullness are the perils of what is hard to safeguard. Consider the likes of Shan Juan, Chao Fu, Guan Yin, and Hu Gong: all trod upon clouds and mist to soar aloft, relied on dragons and phoenixes to elevate their traces, discerned the sheathed blade within fragrant bait, and awakened to the overturned cart upon the road ahead. Shunning treacherous paths to avoid crossing, they evaded the hooks of Zhan He—truly adept at anticipating shadows beyond form and glimpsing solid ice in the first frost. They moved firewood before the blaze raged, furled sails and stilled oars before the gale struck, gazed at the nine oxen and sank deep, beheld the dense thicket and swiftly departed. They did not nest at the tip of the reed, nor lie supine beneath the crumbling cliff. Were these not men of vast capacity, profound insight, and keen perception, who surpassed their peers and walked alone, unbound by convention? Their desires aspired to merge with the Dao of creation, their hearts transcended the myriad things. Covetousness could not sting their purity, nor could turmoil disrupt their sincerity. If one lacks such innate integrity, how can it be attained? This is a path beyond the trodden track.\n\nYet those who know success often withdraw, for those who toil greatly are seldom rewarded. When the cunning hare is caught, the hunting hound is cast aside; when the high bird is felled, the fine bow is set to be discarded. Beholding the mirror of Peng and Han, one recalls the art of withdrawing the hairpin; witnessing the folly of the Yue lineage, one recognizes the value of gold and ivory. Like Lord Fan, who sailed away to escape the limelight, or Master Xue, who fled chaos to preserve his integrity; like the Two Shus, who resigned their seals at the height of abundance, or Tian Yu, who relinquished his sash as the candle waned—advancing avoids the calamity of overreaching, retreating spares the regret of trailing wet. Their pure wind is enough to scatter the dust of a thousand years, their virtuous resonance enough to dispel the delusions of ages to come. Compared to Chen and Dou, how distant they seem!\n\nYet some, though wise, fail in grand schemes; some, though strong, break under heavy burdens. Some, though uniquely right, are ensnared by the many; some, though wholly loyal, are impeached by those guarding all fronts. Some, advocating lofty plans, suffer the fate of Chao Cuo; some, exhausting heart and strength, meet the doom of Wu Qi. Thus, even those who tread cautiously and act with restraint may not escape. The Duke of Zhou was exiled, Confucius departed, Jia Yi was banished to the hinterlands, Sima Qian was branded innocent yet punished, Le Yi pacified Qi, Wu Zixu shattered Chu, Bai Qi expanded the realm with a hundred victories, Wenzi dominated Yue with nine strategies, Han Xin’s merits towered over the world, Qing Bu destroyed his family to aid the mandate—yet glory did not last a day before humiliation followed, nor did they shrink from its disaster. Were these truly wise men?\n\nTo serve as a minister is no easy task; in short, the crux lies in choosing one’s lord. I am not worthy to rely upon—such is the proof. To resign, yield to the worthy, preserve purity, and secure peace; to gain a fine name and ample reward—what greater fortune could there be? To cultivate this art is to grasp one in ten thousand chances. As fortune and misfortune are shaped by man, can one afford not to ponder this?",

      "translated_text": "Those words that grate upon the ear are seldom met with joy; offerings of counsel bring honor, yet may invite ruin or disaster. When slander arises, how can one find the leisure to verify what to accept as true? When snares and nets fill the skies, even the fledgling mandarin duck hesitates to spread its wings; when pits and traps line every path, the unicorn and the sacred tiger retreat into hiding.\n\nThe passions cannot be indulged without limit, nor can desires be sated without end. The enlightened master their emotions through the Dao and dispel desires through strategy—how much more should those who scheme for others ensure loyalty, let alone fail to deliberate when plotting for themselves?\n\nFor the contented, there is ever sufficiency; the insatiable know no sufficiency. Constant sufficiency draws fortune, while insatiability invites calamity. To nourish life excessively is to hasten its end. The Song clan uprooted their seedlings, and the people of Ying exulted in Zhang Hua’s rise—yet their haste brought only withering and ruin. To know advance but forget retreat is to court destruction.\n\nFew who race without restraint avoid stumbling; rare are those who tread waves without end who escape drowning. To wield blades without cease invites wounds; to strike without pause courts breakage. That fullness must yield to loss is the principle of nature—does the vessel of Zhou’s ancestral temple deceive us? Thus, when Yang You shot his arrows, passersby warned him to guard against the wind; when Dongye drove his chariot, Yanzi foresaw his downfall. Success and failure are not easily long endured.\n\nThe drinker need not always descend into chaos, yet most who do are drunk; wealth and nobility do not invariably lead to peril, yet peril often lurks within them. The wise foresee events in their earliest stirrings, fell trees at the first sign of a bud, refrain from boasting when blocks are stacked precariously, and discuss mending furs only after gathering all the fox pelts. The ancients feigned madness or folly—was this their delight? The times demanded it; they had no choice.\n\nSome flee deep into the wilds only to meet waves, or hide in seclusion only to face fire—like Gong Sheng, who starved himself to death, or Li Ye, who swallowed poison in despair. Such fates arise from traces left behind, shadows that cannot be erased. Had their conduct been as cautious as treading ice, their bodies as still as dwelling in shade, their movements leaving no track to follow, and their quietude merging with non-action—would such misfortunes have befallen them? How much less for those who brandish the sun and moon to conceal their forms or beat war drums to seize weapons!\n\nIn an age of clarity, one may excel in aiding all under heaven; in an age of peril, one may barely preserve a single life. This lament is not unique to one scholar.\n\nI have heard that no blaze is unquenched, no excess unchecked; brilliance bears the seeds of ash, and spring’s blossoms foretell autumn’s decay. The sun reaches its zenith and then declines; the moon waxes full and then wanes. The sequence of the four seasons ensures that all who achieve success must retreat. Observe the world: the loftiest structures, once they reach their limit, crumble. Turn to oneself: even fine meals and restrained drink, if immoderate, breed illness and harm one’s nature. How much more for those whose ambitions soar to the clouds without cease, whose power shakes rulers and whose honors mount without end?",

      "translated_text": "The gnat guards against falling from a mountain only to soar freely, while the rhinoceros and tiger, if they plummet, shatter like scallions—this illustrates that great things cannot lose their proper place.\n\nMoreover, when one in upright authority rebukes transgressions and follows the straight Way, when one strikes down those who violate discipline without considering enmity or grudges, resentment deepens and hatred accumulates. Yet if one abandons the law to indulge wrongdoing, if one heeds private pleas like an echo, if one spits out the hard and swallows the soft, bending the rule like a carpenter’s line—does not dwelling in such a position become wearisome?\n\nThus, those who preserve both body and reputation are exceedingly rare, while those who stumble and overturn their cauldrons are not few. Yet within, they recline in ornate chambers with graceful maidens, crimson curtains, and patterned canopies, their couches spread in lavish halls. Radiant beauties dazzle at their sides, their lithe forms and soft voices weaving songs of exquisite artistry—melodies like those of Song Yu and Cai Yong, the grace of *Yang’e*, their lips singing *Cai Ling* and *Yan Lu*, their feet tracing the steps of *Lü Shui* and the *Seven Disks*. Harmonious notes delight the ear, enchanting postures gladden the heart. Secret feasts follow one another, fine wine never withdrawn. Looking up, they ascend carved pavilions; gazing down, they reflect upon clear pools. They wander among fruit groves of crimson and emerald, sport in orchid gardens fragrant with blossoms. Patterned fish glide through the waves, red-feathered birds soar and wheel, arrows bring down swans from the clouds, chariot wheels drag bream and carp from afar. Rare treasures gather without seeking, luxuries arrive unbidden.\n\nAbroad, their vermilion wheels gleam on the roads, lofty canopies press wheel to wheel, crimson banners billow like clouds, insignia and batons command awe, golden drums clamor, halberds and armor glitter. Proudly they ride in the rear carriage, their fine escorts filling the ranks. Their retinues exhaust the pleasures of sightseeing, their hunts and fishing reach the height of joy. Praise for their sagely brilliance fills their ears, while flattering words, spoken with one voice, dismiss the ancients—claiming Yi, Lü, Guan, and Yan are not their equals. How could they perceive the rise and fall as head and tail, joy and sorrow as morning and night? How could they willingly relinquish their exalted glory, beg to return their bones to the earth, turn their backs on vermilion gates, and return to the hills and gardens?\n\nNow, if a sagely enlightened ruler sits above, great worthies assist in governance, the hundred offices are ordered only through them, and the myriad people are saved only through them—those who stand high without fearing peril, who are full without fearing excess—these are not the ones under discussion.\n\n**Chapter Fifty: On Obscurity and Eminence**\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Men of the same talent may yet meet with obscurity or eminence—what is the reason? Does this bind the swift and free, leaving them with regret?\"*\n\nThe Master Embracing Simplicity replied: *\"When abilities are no different, yet some are suppressed and others exalted, it is because they lack a true patron—thus, adversity and prosperity depend on the times. Success and failure are matters of fate. Those who discern the times—why lament their depths? Those who understand fate—why resent their lowly toil?*\n\n*The *Zhanlu* and *Chungou* swords are of the finest steel, yet if not wielded, they cannot even sever morning mushrooms. The *Yaohua* and *Lilü* are treasures beyond price, yet if cast into the mire, tiles and pebbles pile upon them. Thus, things may be precious yet not necessarily prized, may be useful yet not necessarily employed.*\n\n*The vulgar, blind to distinctions, cannot tell red from purple, nor beans from wheat. They deem the eminent worthy merely because they have risen, unaware that what they seek is but fleeting success. They scorn the obscure as inferior, yet do not examine those who uphold the Dao and remain in obscurity.*\n\n*Moreover, the celestial bodies, if not fixed in the heavens, cannot radiate their great light to illumine all without exception. Mount Song and Mount Tai, if not rooted in the earth, cannot tower to the clouds. The hare’s swiftness depends on level ground to gallop, the dragon’s boat rides the rushing currents to display its speed. Fire’s brilliance did not blaze until Suiren, the sharpness of Chu steel was not honed until Ou Ye. Luxuriant blossoms await spring to display their splendor, soaring swans rely on the gale to glide lightly.*\n\n*If the Four Mountains do not commend the worthy, then even the most capable remain unrecognized. If Ya did not recommend Guan Zhong, then Yi Wu would not have been employed. Rangju owed his rise to Pingzhong, Han Xin’s soaring began with Xiao He. Junsheng’s eloquence came from Shengzhi’s counsel, Qu Ni’s advancement stemmed from Wuzhi’s recommendation. Kongming emerged from Longzhong, Gongjin’s fame arose from Gongwo’s support. Thus, their illustrious names were recorded in the imperial annals, their meritorious deeds inscribed in their era.*\n\n*But in the late years of the Han and the final days of Wu, it was not so.

      "translated_text": "They invariably favored those who aligned with themselves, making such attachment the foremost criterion for selection. Those with many factions were invariably chosen, yet those who aligned with them were not necessarily vessels fit for advancement. Those who echoed their own views could not be cast aside, yet those with many factions were not necessarily talents surpassing the common herd. Trusting the clamor of the crowd, they deemed such men worthy; or, believing these to be mediocre and base, they could not relinquish their attachment to the familiar and the near. Or, recognizing those others as exceptional and outstanding, they could not maintain impartiality in utmost fairness. Thus, they cast aside the scales of assessment and took frequency of association as the measure of weight; they abandoned standards of measure and took the density of connections as the gauge of quantity. At such times, those so-called refined men of lofty bearing who wielded the state’s power of promotion and demotion—whose decisions of praise and censure were dictated by mere words—were rare indeed to escape this entanglement. How much more so when, in their hearts, they suddenly harbored hatred, stood alone in resentment, envied those not of their faction, or despised the independent and superior, or scorned the poor and unconnected?\n\nAlas! The scholars of distant custom and the men of unparalleled distinction—those who, generation after generation, failed to meet with recognition—cannot be numbered. Some were suppressed and languished in marshes and wilds; others stood in court only to be cast out. Some cultivated virtue yet their Way did not prevail; some stored their talents yet the times did not guard them. Some waited for the Yellow River to run clear until their teeth had fallen out; some exhausted their loyalty and diligence yet were not known or employed. Their far-reaching influence did not extend to their age; their beneficent deeds did not reach the people. Treasures fit for the banquet mat lay mired in mud; talents for aiding the world ended without application. Like the man who played the zither yet did not meet King Wu Ding, or the one who held the fishing pole yet did not encounter King Wen—from ancient times to the present, how many have there been? Yet to lament this alone is indeed narrow-minded.\n\nTo gaze upon the distant path and be ashamed to follow it, to know the great Dao is obstructed yet not change course, to equate success and failure on a single road, to consign honor and disgrace to nature—how could one harbor melancholy in the face of scarce understanding, or sigh forever at the passing of rivers? To suspect resentment in this is to fail to comprehend the mind of the perfected person.\n\nThe ignorance of short-lived creatures regarding the long-lived, the frog in the well’s incomprehension of the vast sea—these have always been so.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One**\nThe *Baopuzi* states: There was a man called Master Tranquil and Profound. Though his years were but those of one who studies the will, he had already exhaustively perused the Six Classics and broadly synthesized the *He* and *Luo* texts. By day, he contended with the last rays of Xi He; by night, he illuminated the lingering glow of Wang Shu. No Dao was too distant for him to fathom; no word was too obscure for him to plumb. He took Confucianism and Daoism as his city walls, his spiritual acuity as his weapons. Thus, those who discoursed could not but trail dust and proffer jade in his presence; scholars, upon setting eyes on him, laid down their brushes. Soon, they awoke to the wisdom of silence and realized the blamelessness of guarding the One. When his intent was fulfilled, he deemed the fish-trap and rabbit-snare discardable; when the Dao diverged, he perceived that lofty singing finds few harmonies.\n\nThereupon, he embraced Laozi’s caution against frequent defeat and pondered the admonition of the golden man’s triple-sealed lips. He sheathed his blade’s edge as if encasing it, polished his brush on the vermilion tube, held gold and jade within, and restrained his florid eloquence. From dawn to dusk, he might utter not a single word. His disciples approached and said: “Master, you remain silent—how can your disciples expound? You differ not from the common man.”\n\nI privately thought: If the great bell does not sound, it is no different from a heap of bronze; if the floating chime ceases its tone, it is indistinguishable from a pile of stones.\n\nMaster Tranquil and Profound replied: “I seek only to gather a distant name across ten thousand generations and find a true friend in the ages to come. How could I vie for recognition in this day or set my standard in this moment? A vessel for brewing fine wine, though excellent, does not itself become drunk. One who speaks humbly yet loftily, though correct, is not believed. To curl the tongue and exhaust the voice—what remedy is there for fleeing and evasion? The ancients laughed at fifty-nine when they reached sixty; only then did they realize the depth of their past delusion.\n\nFor jade is hard, and gold is strong.”",

      "translated_text": "The Master of Embracing Simplicity, surnamed Ge, named Hong, styled Zhichuan, was a native of Jurong in Danyang. His ancestors descended from the Ge Tian clan, who once ruled all under heaven in ancient times. Later, they were demoted to the ranks of feudal lords and took Ge as their surname. Hong’s great-grandfather served as Inspector of Jingzhou. When Wang Mang usurped the throne, he scorned to serve a traitorous regime, resigned his post, and returned home. Together with Zhai Yi, Governor of Dongjun, he raised troops to punish Wang Mang but was defeated. Pardoned and spared from disaster, he feigned illness and withdrew from the world. Fearing that the Ge clan’s strength might eventually provoke unrest, Wang Mang relocated them to Langye. Hong’s grandfather, Pu, raised an army to aid Emperor Guangwu, rendering great service. After Guangwu ascended the throne, Pu was appointed General of Chariots and Cavalry, later promoted to General of Agile Cavalry, and enfeoffed as Marquis of Xiapei and Tongxian, with a fief of five thousand households. At the founding of the dynasty, Pu’s younger brother, Wen, followed the marquis on campaigns and achieved repeated victories. The marquis repeatedly memorialized the throne to commend Wen’s merits, but the court, citing Wen’s private service under his elder cousin without official military rank, refused to acknowledge his contributions. The marquis declared, “My brother and I together faced arrows and stones, our bodies covered in wounds, my right eye lost—yet he has received no reward, while I am laden with gold and purple. How can my heart be at ease?” He then petitioned to transfer his own enfeoffment to his brother. The emperor, wishing to honor the marquis’s noble integrity, granted the request. Wen, though reluctant, accepted the title and immediately ceded his residence to become the encampment of the General of Agile Cavalry, establishing his estate in Bowang Ward. To this day, its foundations and stone pillars remain. He also divided his stipends to provide for his officers and soldiers, treating them as generously as the two former marquises. The General of Agile Cavalry repeatedly urged him to desist, but Wen refused, saying, “This only burdens the people further. How can I accept?” Feigning other business, he crossed the Yangtze southward and settled in Jurong, where his descendants tilled the land and found solace in books. Though Wen repeatedly sent envoys to welcome the General of Agile Cavalry, the latter never returned. Instead, he stationed guards to maintain the estate in Bowang, hoping for the general’s eventual return—yet for generations, no one resided there.\n\nHong’s grandfather was a scholar of unparalleled breadth, mastering all fields of learning with profound precision. His literary and artistic attainments stood peerless in his time, and he possessed the talent to govern a state. Serving the Kingdom of Wu, he held successive posts as Magistrate of Haiyan, Lin’an, and Shanyin, then entered the capital as Gentleman of the Ministry of Personnel, Palace Aide to the Censor-in-Chief, Governor of Luling, Minister of Personnel, Junior Preceptor to the Crown Prince, President of the Imperial Secretariat, Grand Master of Ceremonies, Palace Attendant, and Intendant of the Palace Guards. He was also appointed General of Assisting Wu and enfeoffed as Marquis of Wushou. Hong’s father was renowned for his filial piety and fraternal devotion, a model for scholars. His conduct and learning were exhaustively recorded in official histories. He served Wu as Gentleman of the Five Offices, Prefect of Jiancheng and Nanchang, Gentleman of the Imperial Secretariat, and Minister of Justice, then as General of the Guards. He was appointed Governor of Kuaiji but had not yet assumed office when the Jin army advanced downstream, and the western borders collapsed. Recognizing his literary and martial talents, the court and populace unanimously recommended him. He was thus transferred to serve as Commander-in-Chief of Five Commanderies, charged with defending the frontier, granted five thousand personal troops, and placed in command of all expeditionary forces. Yet when heaven decrees ruin, human effort cannot prevail. As the former lord submitted to the Nine Provinces’ shared fate, Hong’s father, retaining his former rank, was summoned to serve as Gentleman of the Palace, gradually rising to the position of Grand Master of Splendid Happiness. He later served as Magistrate of Feixiang, a county of twenty thousand households, where his governance was deemed the finest in the province. His moral transformation was exceptional, his benevolence pervasive, his punishments just, and his domain peaceful, earning him widespread praise. Roads were free of bandits, and no one tilled public fields or crossed boundaries to trade. Even the smallest gifts were refused at his gate, while paper and brushes were supplied from his private funds. Through punishments, order was maintained; without words, transformation was achieved. He resigned due to illness, but an imperial edict summoned him to serve as Prefect of Wu, where he upheld strict integrity, correcting errors, promoting the worthy, and exposing the corrupt. The state and military were governed with solemn harmony. Later, he was appointed Governor of Shaoling and died in office.\n\nHong was his father’s third son. Born late in his parents’ lives, he was doted upon and not strictly disciplined in books and history. At the age of thirteen, he lost his kind father, prematurely deprived of paternal instruction. Struggling with hunger and cold, he personally tilled the fields, laboring beneath the stars and treading upon frost, diligently following the plow. Repeatedly ravaged by war and fire, his family’s books were utterly destroyed. During rare moments of respite from farming, with nothing to read, he carried his satchel and walked to borrow books, only to find that few households possessed complete collections. Thus, he redoubled his efforts, cutting and selling firewood to purchase paper and brushes, writing books by the light of kindling in his thatched hut. For this reason, he could not early immerse himself in the arts and literature. Often lacking paper, he wrote on the same sheets repeatedly, rendering his texts barely legible. At sixteen, he began studying the *Classic of Filial Piety*, the *Analects*, the *Book of Songs*, and the *Book of Changes*. Yet poverty prevented him from seeking distant teachers and friends, leaving him isolated and poorly informed, his thoughts shallow and his understanding limited. Many great principles remained beyond his grasp. Eager to read widely, he devoured all manner of books, memorizing whatever he encountered. Yet his nature was dull and forgetful, his will not steadfast, and his retention weak. Though he sometimes drew upon his readings in his writings, he never achieved the depth of a true Confucian scholar and was unfit to serve as a teacher. The *River Chart* and *Luo Writing*, along with apocryphal texts, he merely glanced at without deep engagement. He disliked astrological manuals, calculations, the Nine Palaces, three-player chess, *Taiyi* divination, and flying talismans, finding no affinity for such arts. Later, he dabbled in wind angles, qi observation, the Three Origins, *Dunjia*, *Liuren*, and *Taiyi* methods, gaining only a rough understanding without deep study. He concluded that such practices were tools for others’ use, mere distractions from self-cultivation. Believing that reducing desires was more beneficial, he abandoned them. According to the *Separate Record of Arts and Letters*, there were 13,299 volumes of books, and since the Wei dynasty, the corpus had doubled. Thus, he realized how much he had yet to see. Books from the south of the Yangtze were incomplete, and he once journeyed to the capital in search of rare and extraordinary texts, only to be thwarted by great chaos, forcing him to turn back midway. Each time, he sighed with regret. Now nearing forty, his youthful aspirations have waned. He thinks only of diminishing desires further, practicing non-action, and perhaps retiring to the marshes to preserve his life. His pursuit of broad learning has thus daily declined.",

      "translated_text": "Ge Hong was a man of simple and rustic bearing, dull by nature, slow of speech, and plain in appearance, yet he never sought to adorn or refine himself. His hats and shoes were filthy and worn, his robes often tattered, and he felt no shame in this. As worldly fashions swiftly changed—now broad collars and wide sashes, now tight sleeves and long hems, now trailing skirts, now garments too short to cover the feet—he remained steadfast in his ways, refusing to follow the shifts of the age. His words were always plain and truthful, free of jest or mockery. When no suitable companion was at hand, he would pass the entire day in silence. Thus, all who knew him called him a man who \"embraced simplicity,\" and so he took this as the title for his writings.\n\nBy nature, Ge Hong was frail and sickly, and poverty left him without carriage or horse. He could not bear to walk, nor did he enjoy it, and he despised the degenerate customs of his time—how men abandoned fundamentals to chase trivialities, how they overindulged in socializing. Thus, he took up his brush in seclusion, dwelling in stillness behind a wattle gate, with no place to rush to or follow after. Even those in power, though near at hand, scarcely knew him. His clothes could not ward off the cold, his roof could not keep out the rain, and his food could not fill his stomach. Yet fame never crossed his threshold, and he could not bring himself to care. Poor, with no servants, his fences collapsed, brambles choked his courtyard, and weeds overran his steps. When he ventured out, he pushed through thickets; when he returned, he brushed past overgrowth. Observers thought him lofty of mind, neglectful of the mundane, and never resentful of his hardships.\n\nUnskilled in formal visits, he never paid respects to officials. Yet when it came to mourning the dead or tending to the sick, he would force himself to go, sparing no effort. But his frailty and frequent illnesses often left him unable to fulfill these duties, and critics would reproach him. Ge Hong accepted the blame without concern. He thought: if his intentions were pure and illness alone prevented him, why should he feel shame? What reason had others not to understand? Only those of clear discernment would forgive him, recognizing that his embrace of simplicity was not a ploy to cultivate loftiness.\n\nMost men cherished the warmth of close bonds and prized the intimacy of those who came to them in ignorance. Ge Hong, however, believed that truly knowing another was no easy task—even the sages found it difficult. Superficial friendships, where words aligned but minds clashed, brought no benefit, only harm. Though he could not sever ties as abruptly as Zhuangzi’s friend did, he insisted on clarity and thorough understanding before committing to a relationship. For this, he was deeply resented, yet he never changed.\n\nThose who chased success and stood obsequiously at the gates of the powerful despised Ge Hong for his difference, slandering him as arrogant and dismissive of custom. But Ge Hong was a man of unwavering conviction; praise and blame alike fell on deaf ears. He loathed those who, relying on their own strengths, belittled the weaknesses of others. As one of the least among Confucians, when he spoke with others, he always gauged their understanding and discussed only what they could grasp, never forcing them toward what they could not comprehend.\n\nWhen debating with scholars, he would lay out the essentials. If he encountered someone of limited ability, he would offer only a rough sketch of his ideas, just enough to spark insight, without pressing the finer points to the point of confusion. Those who listened with a calm mind and pondered deeply often found their own realizations. When he judged someone unfit for discussion, even if questioned, he would plead ignorance to avoid wasting words.\n\nBy nature, Ge Hong deeply disliked imposing on officials or superiors. From youth to old age, he had secretly aided several friends in distress, yet none knew it was he who had helped them. He could not bear to see others wronged and would quietly intervene on their behalf. But for all others—even close relatives—if they held power or influence and were strangers to him, he would not trouble them with so much as a word or half a character.\n\nWhen his supplies ran low and he urgently needed medicine, he would ask friends for help, and if they provided, he accepted without refusal. Any assistance he received, he repaid gradually over time, ensuring the giver never noticed. If the aid did not come from a friend, he would not accept it. When his own provisions lasted ten days, he would share them to relieve others’ needs. But if his own stores were insufficient, he would not deprive himself.\n\nHe did not strive for petty displays of virtue or meticulous scruples. Among villagers, those deemed \"good and kind\" would sometimes bring wine and dishes to visit him. Though he did not consider them his equals, he did not refuse them. If he later repaid the gesture, he did not do so immediately.\n\nGe Hong once remarked on the historian’s account of a man who refused to eat with his brothers but kept his table spotless for guests: such was the false conduct of those seeking fame, not the magnanimity of a statesman. He particularly despised those without principle—men who neglected the fundamentals of farming and weaving to pursue illicit gains. Some sold official appointments for bribes; others exploited their influence to extort wealth. Some took bribes from criminals, others wronged the innocent. Some harbored fugitives and sheltered outlaws; others conscripted laborers to obstruct public works. Some hoarded goods to inflate prices; others monopolized markets to seize profits from the people. Some seized fields and robbed the weak of their livelihoods. They cowered before officials, seeking opportunities to exploit, then flaunted their gains before their wives and concubines or used them to buy fame and rank. With such men, Ge Hong refused all association.\n\nThus, the worldly despised him, and naturally, they kept their distance. No carriage tracks marred his lane, no guests of differing minds crossed his hall. His courtyard could have been set with bird nets, and his tables gathered dust. From the time he first gained understanding until his later years, his lips never uttered another’s faults, nor did he delight in others’ secrets—this came naturally to him. Even his servants, if they had shortcomings or shameful acts, he never mocked. He never judged or ranked people’s strengths and weaknesses, nor did he enjoy scolding others. If pressed by superiors to speak of someone’s likes or dislikes, he would only mention their finest qualities. When discussing writing, he would highlight its best aspects, never pointing out its flaws. Thus, he incurred no resentment for praise or blame.\n\nWhen powerful men occasionally asked him about officials or commoners—who was pure, who was capable—he would extol the virtues of the upright and talented. For the greedy, violent, or ignorant, he would claim to know nothing of them. For this, he was often criticized, accused of being overly cautious, unable to clearly distinguish right from wrong. Yet Ge Hong never altered his ways.\n\nHe often saw how people, when discussing others, would compare and rank them, their praise and criticism often misplaced. Those who were praised would take it as their due, though their virtue might not be genuine. Those who were slighted would hate their detractors to the bone, as if they were blood enemies. Ge Hong took this as a warning and thereafter never spoke of others.\n\nWhen engaging with scholars, he would grasp the main points. If he encountered someone of limited understanding, he would offer only a rough outline of his ideas, just enough to inspire insight, without pressing the finer points to the point of confusion. Those who listened with a calm mind and pondered deeply often found their own realizations. If he judged someone unfit for discussion, even if questioned, he would plead ignorance to avoid wasting words. His nature deeply disliked imposing on officials or superiors. From youth to old age, he had secretly aided several friends in distress, yet none knew it was he who had helped them. He could not bear to see others wronged and would quietly intervene.

Books from the south of the Yangtze were incomplete, and he once journeyed to the capital in search of rare and extraordinary texts, only to be thwarted by great chaos, forcing him to turn back midway.

      "translated_text": "Though his clan’s disciples and younger kin might deem such a stance too lenient, he would assign them both praise and blame without distinction. Some mocked him for this, to which he replied: “My person belongs to me. The principle should be easy to grasp. Suppose someone asked me to compare myself to the ancients or to my contemporaries, forcing me to rank myself—truly, I could not know with whom I might be matched. How much less should I presume to judge those who are not myself?\n\nIn the late Han, the corruption of custom gave rise to factions and cliques. Men like Xu Shao and his ilk wielded their tongues to issue warnings and engage in disputes, turning debates into feuds. Thus, the scholars of Runan had no fixed reputations, only the monthly evaluations of character. Even Emperor Wu of Wei deeply despised this and sought to behead them, driving them to flee in panic, nearly to the point of annihilation. The lesson lies close at hand—one may well take it as a teacher.\n\nMoreover, people are not easily known. Even fathers and elder brothers may not fully understand their sons and younger brothers. Is what aligns with me necessarily right? Is what differs from me necessarily wrong? Some begin well but end poorly. Yao, the Duke of Zhou, Confucius, and Jizha all lamented their own incompleteness. How can those of us with narrow, flickering candlelight vision presume to judge others and assess their worth? Do we surpass those sagely and virtuous ancients?\n\nDuring the Da’an era, Shi Bing rebelled, ravaging six provinces. Villages and towns were laid waste, and the righteous cause was overturned. The Grand Marshal of the Righteous Army summoned Hong to serve as a general and captain. Repeatedly pressed, and fearing deep calamity would befall his homeland, he recalled the ancient principle of aiding those in dire peril. Yet he also dreaded military discipline and dared not act on his own will. Thus, he recruited several hundred men and joined the army in its advance. Once, they attacked a separate rebel force and routed them. On that day, coins and silks piled like mountains, and treasures covered the ground. The other armies all released their soldiers to gather spoils, their carts and packs stretching end to end. Hong alone ordered his troops not to stray from formation. If any soldier was found looting, Hong immediately executed him as an example. Thus, none dared abandon their posts. Later, when hundreds of ambushers emerged to strike the other armies, those forces had scattered, their men and horses burdened with plunder, their fighting spirit gone. They fell into chaos, suffering heavy casualties, nearly beyond recovery. Only Hong’s troops remained orderly, their carts and tents undamaged, saving the other armies from total collapse. Hong’s merit was great in this.\n\nIn a later battle, he slew a minor rebel chieftain and captured many suits of armor and heads, presenting them as trophies to headquarters. The Grand Marshal then bestowed upon Hong the title of General Fubo, along with a gift of a hundred bolts of cloth, following standard practice. Many officers sealed their rewards or sent them home, but Hong distributed his among his officers and soldiers, as well as to impoverished acquaintances. Of the hundred bolts, he kept only ten for himself, then immediately used them to buy meat and wine to feast his officers and men. For a time, this became the talk of the day.\n\nWhen the conflict ended, Hong cast aside his weapons and armor and headed straight for Luoyang, seeking to expand his collection of rare books. He made no mention of his military achievements, secretly admiring the principle of Lu Lian, who refused gold from Liaocheng, and Wu Zixu, who declined rewards for preserving Chu—embracing the virtue of not dwelling on success.\n\nJust then, the capital fell into great turmoil, and the northern roads were blocked. Chen Min rebelled in Jiangdong, cutting off the return route. An old friend, Dong Ju, who had been appointed Governor of Guangzhou, submitted a memorial requesting Hong as his adjutant. Though the post was not to his liking, the south offered a refuge, so he reluctantly accepted. Sent ahead to muster troops, he waited for Dong Ju to follow, but Dong was killed en route. Hong thus remained in Guangzhou, frequently invited by regional commanders to serve, but he declined every offer.\n\nHe reflected: wealth and honor may be gradually attained but cannot be seized all at once. The pursuit of such things is wearisome and enough to exhaust a person. Moreover, glory and power are like lodgers—neither permanent nor something one can cling to. What rises high will inevitably fall; what blazes bright will fade. Like spring blossoms, they must wither. To rejoice in gaining them or grieve in losing them is to invite endless regret, sorrow, and fear—struggles too numerous to name. They are not worth the trouble.\n\nAssessing his own nature, he found it deeply indolent, his talents severely limited. Even if he were to bow and scrape, rushing about in the dust, he would surely fail to achieve great fame or avoid entanglements—how much more so given his inability? Better to cultivate the Way of Master Red Pine and Wang Qiao, which lies within oneself and does not depend on others.\n\nHe aspired to ascend famous mountains, practice dietary arts, and nurture his nature—not out of neglect for worldly affairs, but because one cannot serve both at once. If he did not abandon worldly duties, how could he cultivate tranquility and the profound?\n\nMoreover, true understanding is difficult and cannot be borrowed through inquiry or discussion. Thus, his carriage and horses never entered the domains of the powerful, and not a single word of his writing was exchanged with those in office. Though he could not entirely withdraw from the scholar’s circle, he refused to receive visitors. When others’ works infringed upon his own, he could not maintain his focus. He sighed: “There is no Dao in the mountains and forests.” Yet the ancients who cultivated the Dao invariably entered the mountains and forests, truly seeking to distance themselves from clamor and prevent their minds from being disturbed.\n\nNow, he would fulfill his original aspiration: leaving his homeland, he would journey to Mount Song to seek the path of Fangping and Liang Gong. His earlier work, the *Master’s Book*, in both inner and outer chapters, had fortunately already been completed. He would now compile and arrange it to show to future generations.\n\nAt fifteen or sixteen, he had written poems, rhapsodies, and miscellaneous essays, which he then believed were passable. By the time he reached twenty, he reviewed them again and found much unsatisfactory. His talent had not necessarily improved—only his reading had broadened, and he now discerned the difference between the refined and the coarse. Thus, he discarded most of his earlier work, keeping less than one-tenth. Excluding the *Master’s Book*, he still had over a hundred scrolls of miscellaneous writings, though many remained unrevised, filled with sorrow and indignation, and he lacked the leisure to refine them further.\n\nOthers wrote swiftly, finding satisfaction in their work as soon as it was done. But his own talent was dull, his thoughts slow, and he could not produce polished prose on demand. Each time he revised a character, the text improved, but his laziness and the volume of his work prevented frequent review.\n\nIn his twenties, he had calculated that writing minor, trivial pieces wasted time better spent establishing a coherent philosophy. Thus, he began drafting the *Master’s Book*. However, war and upheaval scattered him, and some works were lost. For over a decade on the road, he did not take up his brush. Only in the Jianwu era did he finally settle, completing twenty inner chapters and fifty outer chapters, along with a hundred scrolls of stele inscriptions, eulogies, poems, and rhapsodies. He also wrote thirty scrolls of military documents, proclamations, letters, and memorials. Additionally, he compiled works not included in common catalogs: the *Biographies of Divine Immortals* in ten scrolls, the *Biographies of Recluses* in ten scrolls, and an anthology of essential passages from the Five Classics, the Seven Histories, the Hundred Schools, military affairs, techniques, and miscellaneous wonders, totaling three hundred and ten scrolls, each with its own catalog.\n\nThe inner chapters discuss matters of Daoist concern: divine immortals, elixirs, strange transformations, life-nourishing practices, longevity techniques, and methods to ward off misfortune. The outer chapters address Confucian themes: human successes and failures, and the right and wrong of worldly affairs.\n\nHong noted that Emperor Wen of Wei’s *Canon of Classics* omitted mention of games like tanqi and swordplay. He intended to briefly record what he knew, but in truth, his skills were few and minor, and he could not boast falsely. Now, he would fully describe what he had not yet mastered.",

      "translated_text": "Ge Hong’s nature was dull and his talents mediocre. From the time his hair was first tied up in childhood, he lagged behind other boys in tossing tiles or wrestling. He never fought cocks, raced dogs or horses, and when he saw others gambling, he paid no heed. Even when dragged along to watch, he remained utterly disengaged, as if dozing in broad daylight. To this day, he does not know how many lines are on a chessboard or the names of the dice in *chupu*. He considers such pastimes trivial arts that scatter the mind and waste time. For officials, they harm governance; for scholars, they disrupt recitation; for commoners, they cause neglect of farming; for merchants, they lead to loss of goods. Before the outcome is decided, players grow heated in dispute, their faces flushed with anger, calling this \"amusement\" when in truth it is torment. It erodes integrity, sparks contention, invites heavy wagers, and breeds hidden grudges. In the past, Duke Min of Song and the Crown Prince of Wu met with fatal disasters, while the rebellion of the Seven States nearly toppled the imperial court—lessons bright as mirrors for a hundred generations. Whenever he observed players, he saw them flushed with shame and rage, striking out with hands and feet, hurling insults, severing friendships, and breaking ties—all too common. Resentment does not depend on scale; whether great or small, it often brings regret. Such pursuits are not worth the trouble.\n\nConfucius warned against dozing in the daytime, but compared to Ge Hong, even that seems preferable. Daytime dozing is merely unproductive, whereas it does not risk resentment or litigation. The sage still wore out bamboo strips three times in his devotion to the classics—how could an ordinary man of modest talent manage both? All such games are inferior to even a foot of books. Thus, he naturally disliked them and never engaged, though such pastimes are dear to the common crowd.\n\nIn his youth, he once studied archery, but his strength was insufficient to draw a strong bow—only one like Yan Gao’s. He believed archery was among the Six Arts and could be used to repel bandits, resist raids, and hunt birds and beasts, so he practiced it. Once, while in the military, he shot at pursuing cavalry, striking down two enemies and a horse, thereby escaping death. He also learned the use of the shield and single- and double-edged swords, all with oral formulas and essential techniques for subduing opponents. There were even secret methods so skillful they seemed divine. When facing the untrained, he could single-handedly prevail, advancing without hindrance.\n\nLater, he learned the seven-foot staff technique, which could be used to disarm opponents or break through defenses. Yet this, too, was a non-essential skill—knowing it was like possessing the horn of a qilin or the spur of a phoenix: what need was there for it? Few in his time understood such things.\n\nFrom a young age, Ge Hong had a steadfast resolve never to enter officialdom. Whenever he read the biographies of Chao Fu, Xu You, the northern recluse of Zizhou, the two Jiangs of Shihu, the two Xiaos, Fazhen, and Zilong, he would set aside his books and lean forward in admiration. He aspired to master the Five Classics and compose a work of his own, so that later generations would know him as a literary scholar. Later, when the prefecture and the General of Chariots and Cavalry summoned him, he declined. Though recommended to the prime minister’s office of the Prince of Langye, when the uprising began and the rebels were pacified, he did not seek recognition or visit the office to claim merit. The officials in charge never rewarded his contributions.\n\nHe hoped that the King of Jin, who answered Heaven’s call and followed the people’s will, would restore order, revive the fading imperial lineage, repair the neglected ancestral temples, and honor the unrecognized merits of the previous dynasty to encourage future service. Ge Hong followed the general amnesty and, in the year *gengyin*, received an edict granting him the title of Marquis of Guanzhong, with a fief of two hundred households in Jurong. He had secretly led troops to suppress rebels and save his homeland, but his efforts were deemed insufficient for record. The honor of golden and purple seals was not his original aspiration. He had wished to emulate Lu Lian from afar and Tian Chou more closely, submitting petitions to decline and fulfill his reclusive ambitions. However, a general amnesty was in place, and his request was not granted.\n\nIn the past, Zhong You declined a reward he was due, yet this discouraged others from doing good. The barbarians had not yet been pacified, the realm was troubled, and the state sought to clarify rewards and punishments to uphold the law. How could a humble man like himself stubbornly cling to his timid resolve and resist the grand, all-encompassing system? Thus, he set aside his personal inclinations and respectfully accepted the imperial decree.\n\nAfter Ge Hong wrote his autobiographical essay, someone challenged him, saying: \"In his later years, Wang Chong feared his name and deeds would perish, so he wrote an account of himself. You, however, are in the prime of life, living in an era of sagely rule. You should be untying the silk bundles of Shen Gong and mounting the rush mats of Mei Sheng, illuminating the Nine Five with your brilliance and surpassing the fame of Kunwu. Why instead pursue the path of an old scholar, wasting your fragrance?\"\n\nGe Hong replied: \"Heaven and Earth stretch vast, yet man dwells as if in a borrowed abode. The morning mushroom’s brief bloom withers before the day is done; the spring flower’s glory fades within ten days. Even the fleeting flight of the whirlwind or the sudden flash of lightning are not necessarily swifter. The span of a hundred years is like a shooting star’s swift passage; gray hair flies by like an arrow through a gap. How much more so for those who wither in summer’s heat or perish before autumn’s chill? Thus, Xiangzi lamented the unharvested grain, and Yang Xiong mourned his early death.\n\n\"Looking back through the ages, extraordinary men have risen like dragons through literary arts or crouched like tigers through martial deeds. Their great merits are recorded in the bright halls, their virtuous reputations echoing through the bamboo and silk. Though their forms may decay in the earth, their fine reputations soar with the days.
