Wishing to blend His radiance with the dust of the world to establish the teachings of the age, He first commanded the Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden to descend and become the daughter of the Yin family of Tianshui, named Yishou, who married the immortal Li Lingfei.\n\nThe Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden is none other than the Supreme Primordial Lord.\nLingfei was a descendant of Gaoyao. By the Shang dynasty, his family had transmitted the Dao of nurturing life from father to son. His father, Qingbin, lived over a hundred years yet retained a youthful appearance. He wandered among the Five Peaks and the various mountains, until one day a cloud and dragon descended to welcome him, and he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Inspired by his father’s ascension, Lingfei cultivated the Great Dao with diligence, and after more than a hundred days, he too ascended to heaven before Lord Lao’s birth.\n\nIn the eighteenth generation of the Shang dynasty, in the seventeenth year of King Yangjia’s reign—the year *gengshen*—Lord Lao divided His spirit and transformed His qi from the Great Clarity Realm. Riding the essence of the sun and driving a nine-dragon chariot, He descended as a five-colored flowing pearl. At that time, the Yin lady was napping in the daytime when she dreamed the sky opened for several *zhang*, and a host of immortals bore forth the sun. After a long while, the sun gradually shrank and fell from the heavens as a five-colored pearl, the size of a pellet. She cupped it in her hands and swallowed it, awakening to find herself with child. Today, at the Celestial Tranquility Palace in Bozhou, the Flowing Star Altar marks the site. Thereafter, her complexion grew ever more youthful, and her spirit remained serene. In the chamber where she dwelt, the six qi harmonized—winter brought no biting cold, nor summer any oppressive heat.\n\nThe auspicious radiance illuminated her chamber, and no evil could assail her. Eighty-one years passed unnoticed. In the ninth year of King Wuding of the twenty-first Shang dynasty, the *gengchen* year, on the fifteenth day of the second month (the *jianyin* month) at the hour of *mao*, the sagely mother, grasping a plum branch, suddenly gave birth from beneath her left armpit. As recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*, all accounts state he remained in the womb for eighty-one years. Only the *Inner Transmission* states: The Supreme Master of the Celestial Court, moved by the essence of the sun entering her mouth, conceived. After seventy-two years, he emerged by cleaving her left armpit. Though the two accounts differ, there is reason for both. The *Yu Xuan’s Records of the Northern Frontier* states: Laozi remained in the womb for seventy-two years, with nine years of gestation thereafter—totaling eighty-one years.\n\nAt that moment, the sun’s brilliance doubled, auspicious clouds shaded the courtyard, ten thousand cranes soared in the sky, and the Nine Heavens resounded with celebration. Jade maidens knelt to cradle him, and nine dragons offered water to bathe his sacred form. Where the dragons emerged, nine wells formed. As recorded in Fu Tao’s *Records of the Northern Expedition*: Within Laozi’s temple stand nine wells, their waters all connected—drawing from one causes all nine to stir.\n\nAt his birth, he took nine steps, each step birthing a lotus. His left hand pointed to heaven, his right hand to earth, and he declared: “Between heaven and earth, only the Dao is supreme. I shall propagate the supreme Daoist teachings, universally delivering all sentient beings—whether moving or rooted—throughout the ten directions and the dark prisons of hell, redeeming all who await deliverance. Manifest or hidden, among humankind, I shall serve as the nation’s teacher and model.” Thus, he ascended to the rank of Supreme Immortal of the Great Ultimate, bearing the title *Pin* (or *Yan*—interchangeable in Han script), his given name *Er*, courtesy name *Boyang*. Some call him *Boyang Fu*, a term of reverence for the aged. Alternate names include: *Ya*, courtesy name *Bozong*; *Zhi*, courtesy name *Boguang*; *Shi*, courtesy name *Menggong*; *Chong*, courtesy name *Ziwen*; *Ding*, courtesy name *Yuanyang*; *Yuan*, courtesy name *Boshi*; *Xian*, courtesy name *Yuansheng*; *De*, courtesy name *Bowen*.\n\nNine days after his birth, his body underwent nine transformations, each time clad in celestial robes and a celestial crown, naturally adorned. He possessed seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences. The seventy-two marks were as follows: his head round as heaven, his face radiant as the sun and moon; his jade-like occiput arched, his hair white as a crane’s, over seven *chi* in length. His brows resembled the Northern Dipper, their color emerald green. His beard was tiger-like, his whiskers dragon-like, white and silken. His ears bore hanging pearls, with three passages within, rising level with his crown, thick and firm. His eyes were like rivers, his pupils square with green veins; his nose had twin pillars, its bridge high and prominent. His mouth was square as the sea, his lips red as cinnabar. His breath carried a purple hue, its fragrance like orchids. His teeth were like strung cowries, strong as silver, thirty-two in number, evenly aligned. His tongue was long and broad, patterned like brocade. His voice was like jade, its resonance like metal. His forehead was high and broad, his jaw square as a carpenter’s square. His temples bore the sun’s angle and the moon’s depth, his visage golden, his bearing jade-like. His dragon-like countenance was solemn, his phoenix-like gaze serene. His forehead bore the trigram *dui*, the three *wu* lines ascending. His celestial court was level and expansive, his golden coffer full. His cheeks bore white moles, his jaw a jade pellet. His neck had three folds, white and crane-like. His arms hung past his knees, his hands bore ten whorls. His fingers were slender and long, each marked with auspicious lines. His nails were like jade, his body covered in green down. His chest bore the *yan* bone, his back the *he kui*. His navel was over an inch deep, his belly soft as silk. His heart bore brocade-like patterns, his abdomen a dark intent. His eyes had wheel-like veins, his feet trod the two *pian* stars. His toes bore the symbols of *qian* and *kun*, his height twelve *chi*. His entire body exuded fragrance, his face square and lustrous. His form was proportioned in three equal parts, his body like vajra. His appearance was as luminous as lapis lazuli, his gait like a tiger’s, his movements like a dragon’s. Such were his marks.\n\nTo his left stood the Azure Dragon, to his right the White Tiger; before him the Vermilion Bird led, behind him the Dark Warrior followed. Purple clouds shaded his head, lotuses bore his feet, twin luminaries crowned his neck, and fivefold brilliance shone like the sun. His body bore the round symbol, illuminating the Nine Heavens. Combined with his previous immortal marks, their radiance was wondrously fair—eighty-one in total, called his excellences.\n\nHis gestation of eighty-one years fulfilled the supreme yang number of nine nines. Born with white hair, he was thus called *Lao* (Old). The ancients addressed teachers as *zi* (Master), and *zi* was also a general term for men, hence the name *Laozi*. He dwelled in Li Xiang of Qu Ren Village, Ku County, Chen State, on the northern bank of the Wo River—present-day Weizhen County in Bozhou.\n\nAfter giving birth to the Dao-incarnate body, the sagely mother returned to the celestial palace, resuming her position as the Primordial Lord. To demonstrate to the world the way of master-disciple transmission, she addressed Laozi: “All beings born between heaven and earth possess both purity and turbidity. Those of pure *qi* are clear-minded, compassionate, and kind; those of turbid *qi* are foolish, cruel, and violent. The enlightened cultivate to refine their nature; the deluded indulge desires to harm their lives. Nature is the source of the body; life is the root of existence. Thus, those who cultivate and study refine their bodies with the nine elixirs, untie the knots of the five spirits, guide *qi* to its origin, and sever the roots at the three barriers. Through nine refinements and ten transformations, the hundred joints become luminous. When the fetal knots are severed, one knows the original truth and ascends as a supreme immortal. Without cultivation, demonic influences enter the body, a hundred illnesses arise, life is not fully lived, and suffering is beyond words.\n\nImmortality arises from the heart’s study. With sincerity, immortality is achieved. The Dao values inner seeking; inner secrecy brings the Dao. Cultivate stillness to unite with the true, accumulate emptiness to commune with the divine, and the day of attaining immortality draws near. If the heart competes and the spirit labors, the body grows restless and unfocused, movement and stillness dissipate essence, the ears and eyes grow overly keen—even with long accumulation, the Dao remains distant. This sojourn in the world of heaven and earth is but a fleeting moment.”\n\nIf one can gather qi to nourish the spirit, endure hardship to concentrate on the true, and persist long enough, one will attain the Dao and dwell with heaven and earth in the Great Void. When one can penetrate emptiness and embody nothingness, sight cannot perceive, hearing cannot detect—then one merges with the Dao in truth.\n\nLaozi said: \"Now, amidst the dust and chaos of the world, can one hope to preserve life eternally and guide others across the ages?\"\nThe Primordial Lord replied: \"I possess a secret treasure, transmitted only to the sagely. Those who cultivate it may endure forever.\"\nLaozi said: \"I wish to hear of its attainment.\"\nThe Primordial Lord said: \"The supreme Dao is profound and obscure, beyond all knowing. Neither being nor non-being, neither sound nor form. Invisible when sought, intangible when grasped. It encompasses heaven and earth, boundless and infinite. Yet it lies near within each body, unfathomable to all. To know its principle is called mysterious virtue.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Does the Dao also have methods to attain it?\"\nThe Primordial Lord said: \"The Dao is the ultimate truth of emptiness and penetration; methods are the wondrous arts of transformation. The Dao employs methods to aid humanity, and through cultivation, one meets the Dao—then transformations become limitless. The essence of the Dao lies in non-action and spontaneity; the secrecy of methods lies in talismans, qi, and elixirs alone. Talismans are the numinous script of the Three Luminaries, the true nature of heaven. Elixirs are the essence and bloom of the Five Phases, the vital fluid of earth. Qi is the harmonious purity of yin and yang, the spirit and brightness of all things. Though one may master a single practice, one must still rely on talismans, elixirs, and the Dao to complete it. This is my secret treasure. To master them together is to endure forever and deliver countless beings.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The body is the vessel for attaining the Dao; qi is the root of life. When the root is severed, life ends; when the vessel decays, the Dao departs. Now, if one wishes to cultivate it so that life is secure and the Dao flourishes, may I hear how?\"\nThe Primordial Lord said: \"Humans are endowed with bones and flesh, like clay in a potter’s hands. If the clay is left unworked, it quickly spoils; if the body is left unrefined, life is short—such is the principle. Even if one’s virtue surpasses all others and the spirit communes with the Great Mystery, the body still cannot escape aging and death. Why is this? It is the nature of transformation, inevitable and unyielding. Only elixirs can refine the form, and only talismans can summon the spirit. When the spirit returns, the heart opens and the nature is at ease; when the form is firm, qi is secure and life is preserved. Then, transforming qi into essence, one penetrates formlessness, soars through the void, and masters life and death—thus enduring forever. Those who attain the Dao, though they face the turning of kalpas and the collapse of heaven and earth, remain untouched by disaster. This is why talismans and elixirs are so precious.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who ingest the divine elixir and live forever—is it the protection of spirits, or the power of the elixir?\"\nThe Primordial Lord said: \"The merit of long life lies in the elixir; the elixir’s completion lies in the spirit. Thus, when compounding the elixir, one must rectify body and mind, avoid transgressions, and the spirit will protect it—then the elixir will surely form. When the divine elixir enters the mouth, life knows no end. Heaven and earth bear witness: the Dao returns to the benevolent. The teeming masses, like walking corpses, do not believe long life can be learned, dismissing it as empty fantasy. From dawn to dusk, they engage only in acts that hasten death—how can heaven force them to live? Indulging desires to the full, they perish in an instant, and though a thousand gold pieces are spent on their burial, what benefit is there? When the Way of the divine elixir is perfected, not only does one attain long life, but it may also become a treasure of the world. Those who know this Way—what need have they for the world? If one offered a kingdom in exchange for my formula, I would not transmit it to the unworthy.\"\n\nLaozi bowed deeply and said: \"I wish to hear its essentials.\"\nThe Primordial Lord then raised his head and let out a long whistle. Suddenly, a purple cloud like a canopy descended from the heavens, suffused with five colors and radiant light spreading in all directions. The immortal Juanzi attended him, and the Primordial Lord unfurled the sacred charts of divine transformations, the methods of returning elixirs, refining cinnabar, subduing fire, and the arts of liquid mercury and gold—seventy-two scrolls in all—and bestowed them upon Laozi. Their texts read:\n\n*First, the Mysterious White gives birth to the Golden Elder,\nThe sun’s flowing pearl enters the Flowery Pond.\nWithin the pound, five taels of patterned cinnabar gather,\nRed salt and white snow form the male and female.\nWith the Five Talismans and Nine Elixirs, one may ascend—\nThe true Way lies here, yet none know it.*\n\nThe Five Talismans are: first, the Mysterious White; second, the Golden Essence; third, the Flying Talisman; fourth, the Golden Bloom; fifth, the Three-Five Azure Dragon Essence.\nThe Nine Elixirs are: first, the White Snow Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; second, the Male-Female Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; third, the Yellow Bloom Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; fourth, the White Bloom Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; fifth, the Elixir Bloom Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; sixth, the Five-Color Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; seventh, the Clay Mercury Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; eighth, the Golden Essence Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; ninth, the Nine Cauldrons’ Radiant Ultimate Elixir. Of these nine elixirs, obtaining even one allows one to live forever—there is no need to practice them all.\n\nThe Way of the divine elixir undergoes three transformations and five turns, culminating in nine. Those who ingest it become equal to me. The Way of immortals does not lie in sacrifices or prayers to spirits, nor in guiding and stretching exercises, nor in sighing wishes or verbose speech, nor in exhausting oneself with intense thought. The essence of long life lies in the divine elixir—knowing it is easy, but practicing it is truly difficult. If you can follow it, you may endure forever. This Way exists to attain immortality; even I learned it—it is not innate.\"\n\nLaozi bowed again and said: \"I have received your gracious instruction on the Nine Elixirs. Yet I have heard that without the Golden Liquid, one’s efforts to seek immortality are in vain. I humbly wish to know its essentials.\"\nThe Primordial Lord said: \"Your question is profound indeed. The Nine Elixirs and the Golden Liquid are both paths to ascending to heaven. Yet among the Nine Elixirs, the Golden Liquid is supreme. Those who ingest the Nine Elixirs may, after three years, two years, one year, half a year, a hundred days, sixty days, thirty days, or even three days, be welcomed by immortal officials with clouds and dragons.\"\n\nOnly those who ingest the Golden Liquid will, upon taking it into their mouths, find their bodies suffused with a hue of purple-gold, wings sprouting forthwith, ascending to heaven to become immortal officials. Those who wish to ingest it must first observe a prolonged fast, abstain from grains for a full year, and only then may they partake of it. Unless one’s name is recorded in the Register of the Mysterious Center and bears the title of the Undying, one shall never hear of the Way of the Golden Liquid. Its method follows the previous alchemy of compounding the elixir; once the gold is formed, it is liquified, and the Way is complete. This is my secret treasure. It comprises one thousand two hundred incantations, which I received from the Primordial Celestial Worthy in the distant kalpas before the dust of countless worlds arose. I practiced them faithfully and thus attained the rank of Supreme Primordial Lord. In former times, I transmitted them to the Perfected, the Great Sage, the Celestial Emperor, the Supreme Emperor, and the Primordial Lord of the Grand Tenuity and Grand Unity. Now I bestow them upon you—strive diligently in their cultivation.\"\n\nLaozi, having received the transmission, again inquired: \"The teeming multitudes of the world, driven to the brink of death—if this Way were widely bestowed to deliver them, how might it be done?\"\n\nThe Primordial Lord replied: \"The careless masses, lost in indulgence and desire, perish like stones cast into rivers, gone without return—how grievous and lamentable! Yet the Dao does not act in vain; it must be entrusted to the worthy. This Way is lofty and wondrous, concealed within the Nine Mysteries’ Jasper Terrace and Cloudy Peaks. Once in ten thousand years, it is transmitted only to those whose names are inscribed in the Mysterious Register. Unless one is destined by innate bone and has endured the trials of alchemical refinement, one shall not hear of it. Fools err repeatedly, only then seeking to purge their faults—how could one defy celestial decree and recklessly divulge it? My teachings end here. I shall depart now, but the Primordial Lord of the Grand Unity will speak with you further.\"\n\nAs he finished speaking, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, the Perfected of the Five Emperors, escorted him in an eight-scene jade carriage, ascending to heaven.\n\nThe *Divine Elixir Scripture of the Grand Clarity* records that its method originates from the Supreme Primordial Lord. Its divine power harmonizes yin and yang, commands wind and rain, advances and retreats the five stars, and regulates cold and heat. It harnesses nine dragons and twelve white tigers, and all immortals under heaven revere and submit to it. The life and death of humankind are governed by this—indeed, it is said to arise from the ingestion of the elixir.\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Grand Unity\nLaozi then wandered through mountains and marshes, seeking to refine the divine elixir. Passing through Mount Lao, he encountered the Primordial Lord of the Grand Unity, riding a five-colored mottled qilin, attended by dozens of officials. Laozi followed and inquired of the Way. The Primordial Lord said: \"The essence of the Dao lies in the returning elixir and the Golden Liquid.\" Thereupon, he fully transmitted the secret incantations. In later years, on Mount Li, Laozi again met the Primordial Lord of the Grand Unity and expressed gratitude for the divine elixir’s method. The Primordial Lord replied: \"I am the sovereign of all immortals, the master of the myriad Ways. The mysterious and numinous arts are rooted in the profound—why should you demean yourself with thanks?\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The common people, ignorant and dying in great numbers, move me to tears of blood. I grieve to see it. If I could bestow upon them the divine medicine, allowing all to attain longevity, would it be permissible?\"\n\nThe Primordial Lord replied: \"It may not be done. The Way of life is most weighty; it must be entrusted only to the greatly virtuous, the filial, the sincere, and the steadfast. Heaven generates the myriad things—some good, some evil. The good are fit to live; the evil are fit to be eradicated. It is not fitting to dispense the medicine to all, allowing them to live. You already understand this—do not lightly disclose it.\"\n\nLaozi, recognizing that the Way of immortality requires cultivation, wished to leave behind a method to encourage future generations. Thus, he preserved authenticity, embraced the One, refined the elixir, and ingested qi. Thereafter, he soared through the void, transcending existence and non-existence, traveling wherever he willed, beyond mortal comprehension. One day, he mounted a white deer, trod upon the cypress of the courtyard, and ascended to heaven.\n\nThe Primordial Lady of Metal\nThe Primordial Lady of Metal is the Nine Numinous, Most Wondrous, Tortoise Mountain Primordial Lady of Metal. She is also called the Most Numinous Nine Radiance, Tortoise Terrace Primordial Lady of Metal, and the Queen Mother of the West. She is the supreme mystery of the Western Florescence, the ultimate honor of the Dark Yin. In ancient times, when the qi of the Dao congealed in stillness, her essence abided in non-action. Desiring to initiate the profound work of generating and transforming the myriad things, she first transformed the Perfect Qi of the Eastern Florescence, giving birth to Lord Wood. Lord Wood was born upon the Azure Sea, in the Wilderness of the Blue Numinous, to govern the qi of harmonious yang in the East—he is also called the Lord King of the East. Then, from the Perfect Qi of the Western Florescence, she transformed and gave birth to the Primordial Lady of Metal. The Primordial Lady of Metal was born in the Divine Continent’s Yi River, her surname being Hou. Born with the ability to soar, she governs the qi of numinous yin in the West—she is also called the Queen Mother. Both emerged with great primordial substance, nurturing the mysterious and profound. In the vast wilderness of the West, they divided the pure essence of the Great Dao, condensing qi into form. Together with Lord Wood of the East, they govern the two qi, nurturing heaven and earth, shaping the myriad things.\n\nTheir essence embodies the root of gentleness and compliance, the origin of ultimate yin. Their position corresponds to the West, where they mother and nourish all beings. In heaven above and below, across the Three Realms and Ten Directions, all women who ascend as immortals and attain the Dao are subject to her. Her palaces and towers reside on Tortoise Mountain’s Chong Mountain, in the Garden of the Kunlun’s Mysterious Orchard and the Gate of the Wind. There are a thousand layers of golden walls, twelve jade towers, jasper palaces, halls of luminous azure, nine-tiered mysterious terraces, and vermilion chambers of purple and emerald. To the left flows the Jasper Pool; to the right winds the Emerald River. At the mountain’s base lie nine layers of weak water, with waves ten thousand fathoms high—none may reach it without a wind-driven carriage or feathered conveyance.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* and the *Divine Verifications of the Emperors* state: The Queen Mother’s realm lies in the wilds of the Western Wastes. There stand jade towers firm as heaven, green terraces supporting the clouds, chambers of azure jade, and halls of vermilion and purple. Linked jade canopies and luminous curtains glow with the brightness of four moons. She wears floral crowns and bears numinous insignia. To her left attend immortal maidens; to her right, feathered youths. Her jeweled canopy casts a distant glow; feathered ornaments shade the courtyard. Beneath the balustrades grow trees of white jade and forests of cinnabar-hardness. Ten thousand branches of malachite, a thousand trunks of jasper—though no wind blows, divine music arises of its own, resonating with the eight harmonies.\n\nThe Divine Continent lies southeast of Kunlun, hence the *Erya* states: \"The Queen Mother of the West is beneath the sun.\"\n\nIt is further said: \"The Queen Mother with flowing hair and a sheng-crown, tiger-teeth and a piercing cry—this is but her messenger, the White Tiger Spirit of the Metal Realm, not her true form.\" The Primordial Heavenly King bestowed upon her the governance of the myriad heavens, the *Nine Radiance Register of Mount Gui*, commanding her to summon all spirits, unify the perfected sages, oversee oaths and bear witness, and preside over the feathered regalia of all heavens. At the assemblies where the Heavenly Worthy and Supreme Saints gather for feasting and judgment, the Queen Mother ever attends in radiant presence.\n\nThe precious scriptures of the *Shangqing*, the Three Caverns, and the jade texts—all that she transmits and ordains—are matters in which she holds sway. In ancient times, when the Yellow Emperor campaigned against the tyranny of Chiyou, his might could not prevail, for Chiyou wrought manifold illusions, summoning winds and calling rains, exhaling mists and spewing fog, so that the imperial host fell into utter confusion. The Emperor withdrew to rest at the foot of Mount Tai, sunk in troubled slumber. The Queen Mother dispatched a messenger clad in a robe of dark fox-fur, who presented him with a talisman, saying: \"With the Great Unity before you, he who obtains it shall triumph; in battle, he shall conquer.\" The talisman measured three inches in breadth and one foot in length, lustrous as jade, its script traced in cinnabar. Once the Emperor had fastened it to his person, the Queen Mother sent forth a woman with a human head and the body of a crow, who addressed him: \"I am the Dark Woman of the Nine Heavens.\" She imparted to him the esoteric arts of the Three Offices and Five Intentions, the mysteries of yin and yang, the techniques of the Great Unity, the *Dun Jia*, the *Liu Ren*, the pacing of the Dipper, the mechanisms of the *Yin Fu*, and the sacred texts of the Five Talismans and Five Victories. Thereupon, he vanquished Chiyou in the heartland of Jizhou.\n\nAfter Shennong’s time, Yu Gang was executed at Banquan, and the realm was brought to great peace; the capital was established at Zhuolu in Shanggu. Some years later, the Queen Mother sent the White Tiger Spirit, who rode a white tiger to the Emperor’s court and presented him with a terrestrial map. In his later years, she again bestowed upon him the precepts of purity, non-action, and the rectification of the true, declaring: \"Cease not from eating and drinking, and the body shall not be light; cease not from thought and worry, and the spirit shall not be clear; cease not from sound and color, and the heart shall not be at peace. If the heart is not at peace, the spirit shall not be efficacious; if the spirit is not efficacious, the Dao shall not be attained. Its essential subtlety lies not in gazing at stars or worshipping the Dipper, nor in afflicting the self or exhausting the body. Its nobility resides in the serenity of the square inch of the heart, free from all restless striving. Only thus may the Way of the immortals be mastered, and long life secured.\"\n\nLater, when Yu Shun assumed the throne, the Queen Mother sent a messenger to present him with a white jade ring and bestowed upon Yi a terrestrial map, thereby expanding the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Provinces into twelve. The Queen Mother further dispatched a messenger to grant Shun the *huangguan* flute, by whose playing the eight winds were harmonized.\n\nIn the twenty-fifth year of King Zhao of Zhou, the cyclical year *yimao*, the Venerable Lord Lao and the Perfected One Yin Xi journeyed beyond the Eight Cords to wander in the west, arriving at Tortoise Terrace, where they expounded the *Changqingmo Jing* to the Queen Mother of the West. Thus, the Left Palace Immortal Duke Ge Xuan of the Great Ultimate later recorded: \"I once received it from the Lord Emperor of the Eastern Flower; the Lord Emperor of the Eastern Flower received it from the Lord Emperor of the Golden Watchtower; the Lord Emperor of the Golden Watchtower received it from the Queen Mother of the West—all transmitted orally, without written record. Now, in this world, I commit it to writing.\"\n\nIn the time of King Mu, he commanded a chariot drawn by eight steeds: on the right rein, *Pili* and *Lü’er*; on the left, *Chiji* and *Baiyao*. The master charioteer was Zaofu, with Gaoju as his right-hand attendant. The second chariot bore on its right rein *Quhuang* and *Yulun*, and on its left, *Daoli* and *Yu*; its master was Boyao, with Canbai as charioteer and Benrong as right-hand attendant. They galloped a thousand *li* to reach the land of the Giant Sou clan.\n\nThe Giant Sou clan presented the blood of a white crane for the king to drink and prepared a broth of oxen and horses to wash his feet. When the two chariots' attendants had drunk and set forth on their journey, they lodged at the slopes of Kunlun, on the northern bank of the Red Water. The next day, they ascended the heights of Kunlun to behold the palace of the Yellow Emperor and sealed it with earth to petition for posterity. Then they were received as guests by the Queen Mother of the West, who feasted the king upon the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother sang for the king, and the king harmonized with her, their verses unfolding as one. They observed the place where the sun sets, traveling ten thousand *li* in a single day.\n\nThe king sighed and said, \"I, alone, am not full in virtue; will later generations recount my faults?\" It is also said: the king held a white jade tablet and layered brocade to offer longevity to the Queen Mother. He sang the \"Song of the White Clouds\" and carved an inscription upon the border at Mount Yi before returning.\n\nThe *Bamboo Annals* states: \"In the seventeenth year of his reign, King Mu journeyed west, met the Queen Mother of the West, and was received as a guest at the Radiant Palace.\"\n\nAmong those who ascend to heaven as immortals, there are nine ranks:\nThe first, the Supreme Immortal, is titled the True King of the Nine Heavens.\nThe second, the Lesser Immortal, is titled the True Sovereign of the Three Heavens.\nThe third is titled the Perfected of the Supreme, the fourth the Flying Perfected,\nthe fifth the Numinous Immortal, the sixth the Perfected,\nthe seventh the Numinous Being, the eighth the Flying Immortal,\nand the ninth the Immortal.\nThese ranks must not be transgressed.\n\nWhen ascending to heaven, one must first bow to the Lord of the East, then pay homage to the Queen Mother of the West. Only after completing these rites may one ascend to the Nine Heavens, enter the Three Clarities, bow before the Supreme, and behold the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning.\n\nThus, in the early Han dynasty, four or five children played by the roadside. One among them sang:\n*\"Donning a blue skirt, entering the Gate of Heaven,\nbowing to the Queen Mother of the West, saluting the Lord of the East.\"*\nNo one present understood, save Zhang Zifang, who went forth to bow and said, \"These are the jade lads of the Lord of the East.\" For when immortals attain the Dao and ascend to heaven, they must salute the Queen Mother of the West and bow to the Lord of the East. None but those who have attained emptiness and ascended to perfection know this path.\n\nEmperor Wu of Han was fond of the Dao of longevity. In the first year of the *Yuanfeng* era, he ascended Mount Songgao, built the Terrace of Seeking the Perfected, and fasted with utmost devotion. On the *wuchen* day of the fourth month, the Queen Mother dispatched Wang Zideng, a jade maiden of Tang City, to address the emperor: \"I hear you wish to relinquish the emoluments of the Four Seas and forsake the dignity of the myriad chariots to seek longevity. Is this true? How diligent you are!\" On the seventh day of the seventh month, she came briefly to visit.\n\nThe emperor questioned Dongfang Shuo to verify the divinity’s authenticity. Shuo then purified himself with a hundred days of fasting and burned incense within the palace. After the second watch of the night, white clouds arose from the southwest, dense and billowing, advancing directly toward the palace courtyard. As they drew near, the clouds and mist took on nine hues, while flutes and drums shook the heavens. A throng of dragons, phoenixes, men, and horses—escorts riding unicorns and deer—accompanied chariots of jade, celestial steeds, banners of rainbow and feathers, and a procession of a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, their radiance illuminating the palace towers. The great immortals and their retinue, arrayed in countless ranks, all stood over a *zhang* tall. Once they reached their appointed stations, the Queen Mother descended from her purple-cloud carriage, drawn by nine multicolored striped dragons, bearing the Heavenly Perfected Staff and the Golden Cinnabar Seal. Her robes of yellow brocade shimmered with vivid patterns, their golden light resplendent. At her waist hung the Sword of Radiant Splendor, tied with the Grand Sash of Flying Clouds. Upon her head rested an ornate topknot, crowned with the Dawn Diadem of the Supreme Perfected. Her slippers were embroidered with square jade and phoenix motifs. Though she appeared no older than twenty, her celestial grace was overwhelming, her divine countenance unmatched in the world—a true spirit among mortals.\n\nAlighting from her carriage, two maidens supported her as she ascended the dais and sat facing east. The emperor knelt in obeisance, inquiring after her well-being, and stood in attendance for a long while before she bade him sit. She then presented him with the delicacies of the Heavenly Kitchen: fragrant blossoms, a hundred rare fruits, purple mushrooms and tender buds, their forms intricate and exquisite—treasures beyond the mortal realm, which the emperor could not name. She further commanded her attendants to bring peaches, seven of which were arranged upon a jade platter, each as large as a goose egg, their flesh like that of a jujube. Four she gave to the emperor, while she herself ate three. As the emperor consumed the peaches, he gathered their pits. When the Queen Mother asked why, he replied, “I wish to plant them.” She said, “This peach bears fruit but once every three thousand years. The soil of the Middle Kingdom is too meager for it to grow.”\n\nThereupon, she ordered Wang Zideng to pluck the strings of the Eight Rarities, Dong Shuangcheng to play the *yunhe* reed pipe, Shi Gongzi to strike the jade chimes of Kunlun, Xu Feiqiong to sound the divine reed organ, Wan Linghua to tap the stone chimes of Wuling, Fan Chengjun to beat the dark-toned chime, Duan Anxiang to perform the Nine Heavens’ melody, and Fa Ying to sing the *Xuanling* hymn. Their voices soared in crystalline purity, their clear notes startling the heavens. When the song concluded, the emperor descended from his seat, kowtowed, and inquired about the Dao of longevity.\n\nThe Queen Mother replied, “If you could scorn glory and delight in humility, immerse yourself in emptiness and savor the Dao, that would indeed be excellent. Yet your nature is indulgent, your desires unrestrained, your debauchery excessive, your killings unlawful, and your extravagance unbounded. Extravagance is the tool that rends the body, lust the axe that shatters it. Killing invites retribution, excess rots the heart. Accumulated desires deplete the spirit; gathered filth severs life. With your fragile frame as a den for thieves of decay, and your scant flesh assailed by a hundred blades, how can you hope to shed the Three Corpses, preserve your body, and endure forever? It would be like a wingless crane aspiring to soar over the celestial pools, or a morning mushroom hoping to enjoy the seasons. If you could sweep away these disorders, purge your impurities, and renew your resolve; safeguard your spirit and *qi* within the Crimson Palace, seal the Jade Chamber and never open it; still your extravagance in quietude, cherish all beings without harm; uphold compassion, practice generosity, refine your *qi*, and treasure your essence—then perhaps you might yet ascend in a halo of mist. If not, you are like one embracing a stone while fording a great river.”\n\nThe emperor knelt to receive the Queen Mother’s admonitions, saying, “I, Zhe, am unworthy, sunk in the mire of the vulgar world. Inheriting the legacy of my ancestors, I have been shackled by worldly burdens. My governance has been flawed, my crimes as vast as mountains. From this day forth, I shall heed your words.”\n\nThe Queen Mother replied, “The Dao of nurturing life and the essence of cultivating the body—you already know these principles. The key lies in diligent, unceasing practice. My master, the Primordial Heavenly King, once imparted to me on the Terrace of Stern Clarity these essential words: *‘To attain long life, draw from within yourself. Firmly guard the Three Ones and preserve the root of spirit. Bathe the Mystic Valley and the Flowery Body in the essence of deep tranquility. Once the pure essence has grown long, let it enter the Gate of Heaven. The Golden Chamber winds through the Central Pass; the Azure and White are distinct at the Mud Pill. Nurture the fluids, seal the essence, and unite body and spirit. The Three Palaces are fully defended, the Crimson Palace preserved. The Yellow Court and the earthly branches have no source of leakage; the five viscera and twelve wheels are thoroughly connected. Exhale and inhale the six bowels, and the hun and po rejoice. Repel the hundred ailments, ward off heat and cold. Preserve essence, retain life, and endure forever.’* This is what is called ‘summoning the Great Harmony, safeguarding the natural, and embracing the true essential Dao.’ If all people practice this, they will surely attain long life, command ghosts and spirits, and wander the Five Peaks—though they may not yet soar through the void. If you can achieve this, it will suffice to transcend the world. All who study immortality must begin here.\n\nAs for the supreme elixirs of the Most High, they are the wondrous treasures of the Celestial Emperor. The *xiayinsheng* and *chongyun* marvelous herbs are the medicines of the immortals. Those who obtain the highest grade will age only after Heaven and Earth, for these are consumed by the Most High—beyond the reach of lesser immortals. The next rank of medicines includes the Nine Elixirs: Golden Liquid, Purple Florescence, Rainbow Essence, Supreme Clarity, Ninefold Cyclic Transmutation, the Five Clouds’ Nectar, Mystic Frost and Crimson Snow, the Soaring Three Yellows, and Eastern Sea White Fragrance. There are also the Flying Life of the Dark Continent, the Eight Stones and Thousand Mushrooms, the Mighty Radiance of Nine Lights, the Western Flowing Stone Gall, the Eastern Azure Coin, the Remnant Grain of High Mounds, the Jade Fields of Accumulated Stones, the Celestial Return Elixir, the Golden Orchid vessel, the Everlasting Radiance herb, and the Flying Dryad of the Snow Lad. Those who consume these will ascend to heaven in broad daylight. These are the medicines of the flying immortals, unknown to earthbound immortals.\n\nThe lower-grade medicines include the fats of pine and *wutong*, *shanjiang*, *shenjing*, chrysanthemum blossoms, *zexie*, *gouqi*, *fuling*, *changpu*, *men* winter, *jusheng*, yellow essence, *lingfei*, red planks, peach resin, *muying*, *shengma*, *xuduan*, *weixi*, and *huanglian*. Such medicines, of which I have only begun to list, are countless in variety, numbering in the thousands. If you consume them, you may prolong your years. Though you may not achieve boundless longevity or ascend to the azure heavens, you can still restore the luster of youth, regain a childlike complexion, command legions of ghosts, and become an earthbound immortal.”\n\nThose who seek the Dao must first rely on this stepping-stone to gradually enter into its mysteries. If one can master breath, govern essence, and secure the spirit and qi—so that essence does not dissipate and qi remains ever-present—one may achieve permanence without death. This requires no expenditure on medicines or stones, nor the toil of seeking and gathering, for it is drawn from within the self. Yet the common people use it daily without awareness—this is the highest, most natural essential method.\n\nNow, the body of each person is endowed by Heaven with spirit, by Earth with form, and by the Dao with qi. Where qi abides, there is life; where qi departs, there is death—even plants and trees know this. Since the body takes the Dao as its root, how can one fail to nourish the spirit, secure the qi, and preserve the form? When form and spirit are both whole, the highest sages prize this above all. When form perishes and spirit flees, is it not grievous? Once this body is lost, it is difficult to recover even after ten thousand kalpas—cherish it well.\n\nWhat I have spoken are the words taught to me by my master, the Primordial Heavenly King. I now urge the Jade Maiden Li Qingsun to transcribe them and present them to the Emperor, saying: \"You must cultivate this diligently.\"\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West then ordered her carriage prepared to depart, but the Emperor rose from his seat, kowtowed, and begged her to stay. The Queen Mother commanded her attendants to summon the Supreme Primordial Lady to descend together to the Emperor’s palace. After a long while, the Supreme Primordial Lady arrived, and they sat once more to set out a celestial feast. Later, the Queen Mother instructed the Lady to bring forth the *Eight Assemblies Scripture*, the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, the *Five Emperors and Six Jia Spirit-Flight Talismans*, and twelve items in all, saying: \"This scripture is transmitted in Heaven only once every forty thousand kalpas. If it remains in the human realm, it may be passed to a worthy adept after forty years.\"\n\nThe Queen Mother then ordered her attendant Song Lingbin to open the cloud-brocade satchel and take out a volume to present to the Emperor. The Queen Mother held the book, stood, and handed it to him. She intoned:\n\n\"High is Heaven, low is Earth,\nTrue forms of the Five Peaks,\nPrimordial true qi surges,\nGreat marsh’s mysterious essence.\nHeaven revolves through nine paths,\nSix harmonies endure in peace,\nThe Supreme Eight Assemblies,\nAchieve flight to celestial realms.\nTrue immortals keep faith,\nThrough this they commune with spirits.\nLeaked, it falls to ruin’s depths—\nTreasure it for long life’s sake.\nHeed this well, I warn you, Liu.\"\n\nAfter the incantation, the Emperor bowed and received the book. The Queen Mother said: \"Those who first learn the Dao and receive talismans should separately offer sacrifices to the spirits of rivers and mountains, purify themselves in fasting, and wear them. After forty years, if you wish to transmit them to your friends, Dong Zhongjun and Li Shaojun may examine them. Moreover, as an emperor, you should diligently sacrifice to rivers and mountains to secure the state, and bestow these sacred texts upon the spirits to pacify the common people.\"\n\nHaving spoken, she and the Supreme Primordial Lady ordered their carriages to depart. Their attendants gathered, preparing to ascend to Heaven. The Queen Mother then smiled and pointed to Dongfang Shuo, saying: \"This is my neighbor’s mischievous child, ever fond of jesting—he has come thrice to steal my peaches. Once a celestial official under the Supreme, he was demoted to serve you after indulging in jade wine and losing harmony in his administration. He is no ordinary man.\"\n\nLater, Emperor Wu failed to heed the Queen Mother’s warnings, becoming ensnared by wine and women, ceaseless in warfare. He campaigned against Liaodong, struck at Chaoxian, opened routes to the southwestern barbarians, built terraces and pavilions, and launched grand construction projects. The realm grew resentful, and from then on, he lost the Dao. Though he later returned to Zhong, visited the Eastern Sea, and thrice sacrificed to the Queen Mother, she no longer descended. The book he had received was placed atop the Bailiang Terrace and consumed by heavenly fire. Li Shaojun departed by dissolving his form, while Dongfang Shuo flew away and did not return. The witchcraft affair arose, and the Emperor grew ever more remorseful. In the second year of the Yuanshi era, he died at the Five Blessings Palace and was buried at Maoling. Later, over fifty volumes of Daoist scriptures stored in Maoling emerged one day in the Baodu Mountains. A jade box and jade staff also appeared in Fufeng, and when taken to Maoling for verification, they remained unchanged. Yet how these objects came into the human world—and for what purpose—remains unknown.\n\nMaster Mao Ying, styled Shushen, followed the Lord of Western City to the White Jade Tortoise Terrace to pay homage to the Queen Mother and seek the Way of long life. He said: \"Though my body is unworthy, I yearn for the years of dragons and phoenixes; though my life is as fragile as a morning mushroom, I seek the span of countless moons.\"\n\nThe Queen Mother, moved by his earnestness, told him: \"I once studied under the Primordial Heavenly King and the Celestial Mulberry Emperor Lord, who taught me the Way of the Jade Girdle and Golden Pendants, the Two Radiant Bindings, ascending to the Great Ultimate, and descending to the Ten Directions. I bathed in moonlight and sipped sunlight to enter the Celestial Gate—this is called the *Scripture of Mysterious Truth*. I now transmit it to you; cultivate it diligently.\" She then urged the Lord of Western City to explain each detail and bestow it upon him.\n\nAnd she bestowed upon him the *Precious Writings of the Four Divine Lads* and the *Dispersed Methods*. Later, Lord Mao retreated south to govern Mount Juqu.\n\nIn the second year of Emperor Yuan’s *Yuanshou* era, on the *jiyou* day of the eighth month, the Perfected of the Southern Marchmount, the Red Lord; the Lord of Western City; and the Azure Lad of Fangzhu all descended from the Queen Mother to Lord Mao’s chamber. Shortly after, the Celestial August Emperor dispatched the Embroidered-Robe Messenger, Ling Guangziqi, to confer upon Mao the divine seal and jade tally. The Lord of the Grand Tenuity sent the Left Palace Censor of the Three Heavens, Guan Xiutiao, to bestow upon him the *Eight-Dragon Brocade Palanquin* and the *Purple Feathered Robe of Splendor*. The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao sent the Harmonious Dawn Gentleman, Shi Shumen, to present him with the *True Talisman of the Golden Tiger*, the *Flowing Gold Bells*, and the *Golden Watchtower Saintly Lord* commanded the Perfected of the Great Ultimate to dispatch the Jade Gentleman of the Supreme Unity and Upper Mystery, Wang Zhong and Bao Qiu, to grant Mao the *Four-Season Swallow Embryo*, the *Flowing Brightness Divine Mushroom*.\n\nWhen the four messengers had finished their transmissions, they had Mao don the seal, robe, and talisman, adjust his cap and sash, and stand holding the bells. The four messengers then addressed Mao, saying:\n\n\"One who consumes the *Hidden Mushroom of the Four Seasons* shall be ranked as a Perfected Minister.\nOne who consumes the *Jade Mushroom of the Golden Watchtower* shall be ranked as Controller of Destinies.\nOne who consumes the *Flowing Brightness Golden Essence* shall be ranked as Controller of Emoluments.\nOne who consumes the *Double-Flying of Eternal Radiance* shall be ranked as Perfected Earl.\nOne who consumes the *Night-Glowing Cave Herb* shall preside over the duties of the Left and Right Censors.\nYou have consumed them all. Your lifespan shall equal that of Heaven and Earth, and your rank shall be Controller of Destinies. You are appointed as the Upper Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, governing the immortals of Wu and Yue, and overseeing the mountain sources of Jiangzuo.\"\n\nWhen they had finished speaking, the messengers all departed. The Lords of the Five Directions each descended to his courtyard in their directional chariots and regalia, transmitting the Celestial August Emperor’s command to bestow upon Mao the *Purple Jade Tablet*, the *Yellow Gold Inscribed Writ*, and the *Text of the Nine Bestowments*. He was then enfeoffed as the *Perfected Lord Controller of Destinies and Upper Minister of the Eastern Marchmount*, and the *Perfected of the Great Primordium*. When the investiture was complete, they all departed.\n\nThe Queen Mother and Mao’s master, the Lord of Western City, then prepared a celestial banquet for Mao. They feasted to their hearts’ content and sang the *Song of the Mysterious Numinous*. When the banquet concluded, the Queen Mother, accompanied by the Lord of Western City and Mao, visited Mao’s two younger brothers and imparted to each the essentials of the Dao.\n\nThe Queen Mother commanded the Lady of the Upper Prime to bestow upon Mao Gu and Mao Zhong the *Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean*, the *Scripture of Cinnabar Radiance*, and four other treasured scriptures. Holding the *Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean*, the Queen Mother ordered the handmaiden Zhang Lingzi to hold the *Pact of Mutual Trust* and present it to Mao, Gu, and Zhong. When the transmission was complete, the Queen Mother ascended to Heaven and departed.\n\nLater, Wang Bao, styled Zideng; Zhang Daoling, styled Fuhan; and the Nine Sages and Seven Perfected—all who had received the scriptures—paid homage to the Queen Mother at the Gate of Kunling.\n\nThereafter, the Lady of Purple Emptiness, Madame Wei Huacun, purified herself in retreat at the *Hidden Primordium Terrace* of Yangluo. The Queen Mother, together with the Saintly Lord of the Golden Watchtower, descended to the terrace in an *Eight-Scenery Cloud Chariot* and proceeded to the *Palace of Pure Emptiness*, where she transmitted the four-scroll *Hidden Writ of the Jade Clarity* to Huacun. At that time, over thirty Perfected Ones—including the Lady of the Three Primes, Feng Shuangli; the Left Immortal Duke of Purple Yang, Shi Lucheng; the High Immortal Earl of the Great Ultimate, Yan Gaigongzi; the Perfected of Western City, Wang Fangping; the Perfected of Grand Emptiness, the Red Pine of the Southern Marchmount; and the Perfected of Tongbai, Wang Ziqiao—each sang the *Yin and Yang Songs of the Great Ultimate*. The Queen Mother then sang:\n\n\"I ride my *Eight-Scenery Chariot*,\nSerene, I enter the *Jade Clarity*.\nDragon banners brush the clouds above,\nTiger legions command the crimson hosts.\nCarefree at the edge of the Mystic Ford,\nTen thousand streams never pause for a moment.\nOnce this parting and reunion is done,\nWhen kalpas end and Heaven and Earth collapse,\nSeek the scene within the Non-Being,\nNeither death nor life shall bind you.\nEmbody the Dao of spontaneity,\nIn silent contemplation merge with the Great Obscurity.\nThe Southern Marchmount nurtures the true trunk,\nJade’s radiance gleams with luminous essence.\nIn office, be free of its burdens,\nWith an empty heart, naturally receive the numinous.\nA joyous gathering at the bend of the Crimson River,\nTogether we delight without end.\"\n\nWhen she finished singing, the Lady of the Upper Prime responded with her own song. Then the Queen Mother, the Lady of the Upper Prime, the Left Immortal Duke of Purple Yang, the Immortal Earl of the Great Ultimate, and the Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness took the Southern Marchmount’s Wei Huacun with them as they traveled southeast to the Jade Palace beneath the Cavernous Palace of Mount Huo on Tiantai. All the Perfected followed the Queen Mother as she ascended and returned to Tortoise Terrace.\n\nThe Queen Mother is the preceptor of the myriad kinds, the overseer of the host of Perfected. Her sacred rank is most exalted, and she governs both the hidden and the manifest. Thus, when the Dark Cavern’s Xuan Gong sought the Dao, he received it in audience, and when Xie Ziranjing attended her to ascend as an immortal, the *Transmission of the Dark Cavern* and the *Transmission of Ziran* both call the Golden Mother their teacher. The attested matters in the mysterious scriptures are many, but most cannot be recorded in full.\n\n*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao Through the Ages, First Scroll* concludes.\n*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao Through the Ages, Second Scroll* begins.\n\nNine Heavens Mystic Maiden\n\nThe Nine Heavens Mystic Maiden was the teacher of the Yellow Emperor and a disciple of the Primordial Sovereign Saintly Mother. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor ruled the state of Youxiong, assisting Yugang, grandson of Shennong. As the latter’s power waned, the feudal lords turned to warfare, their weapons clashing endlessly. Each claimed dominion over a cardinal direction and styled themselves after the Five Phases: the descendants of Taihao proclaimed themselves the Bluegreen Emperor; the lineage of Yugang, grandson of Shennong, called themselves the Red Emperor; the clan of Gonggong named themselves the White Emperor; the heirs of Getian declared themselves the Black Emperor. The Emperor, rising from the lands of Youxiong, took the title of Yellow Emperor.\n\nHe governed with humility, honoring the worthy and cultivating virtue. After twenty-one years on the throne, Chiyou wrought havoc—his eighty-one brothers, beast-bodied and human-tongued, with copper heads and iron brows, devoured sand and swallowed stones, refusing to till the five grains. They devised the Five Cruelties to torment the common folk, forged weapons on Mount Gelu, and defied the Emperor’s commands. Resolved to subdue them, the Emperor sought the wise and capable to aid him. He found Fengtai by the sea, Limu in the great marsh, appointed Dahong as his assistant, and Tianlao as his teacher. He established the Three Dukes to mirror the Three Terraces: Fenghou as the Upper Terrace, Tianlao as the Middle Terrace, and the Five Sages as the Lower Terrace. He then obtained a sacred tripod that cooked without fire. Following the solar cycles, he enfeoffed Hu as general and named Lady Feixiu’s son as crown prince. With ministers such as Zhang Ruoyangpeng, Limu, Rongguang, Longxing, Cangjie, Rongcheng, Danao, and Shelong as his wings, he marched against Chiyou at Zhuolu. Yet the Emperor’s forces could not prevail.\n\nChiyou conjured a three-day fog, shrouding all in disorientation. Fenghou, emulating the Dipper’s mechanism, crafted a great chariot with a ladle pointing south to orient the four directions. The Emperor, grieving and indignant, fasted at the foot of Mount Tai. The Queen Mother dispatched an envoy clad in a black fox-fur robe, presenting him with a talisman and instructing: “Concentrate your spirit and petition Heaven—there shall be a response from the Supreme.” Days later, amid a vast, lightless fog, the Mystic Maiden descended. Riding a cinnabar phoenix and wreathed in radiant clouds, she wore a nine-hued robe of kingfisher plumes. Alighting before the Emperor, he bowed twice and received her command. She declared: “I transmit the teachings of the Supreme. Ask what you will.”\n\nThe Emperor prostrated himself and said: “Chiyou’s tyranny poisons the people; the Four Seas cry out, their lives unprotected. I seek a strategy to ensure victory in a single battle, to rid the world of this scourge. Is this possible?”\n\nThe Mystic Maiden then bestowed upon him the Six Jia and Six Ren military talismans, the *Book of the Five Numinous Talismans for Commanding Ghosts and Spirits*, the *Five Luminous Seals for Subduing Demons and Communing with Spirits*, the *Formulae of the Five Yin and Five Yang Escape Arts*, the *Diagram of the Supreme Unity’s Ten Essences and Four Spirits for Grasping Victory*, the *Oracle of the Five Peaks and River Chart’s Essence*, the *Nine Radiant Jade Tallies and Ten Absolute Spirit Cords*, the *Sword for Commanding Demons*, the *Mist Crown and Flame Girdle*, the *Dragon Halberd and Rainbow Banner*, the *Kingfisher Canopy and Green Plow*, the *Tiger Cavalry and Thousand-Flower Canopy*, the *Eight-Phoenix Chariot*, the *Feathered Key and Mystic Pole*, the *Rainbow Standard and Jade Chime*, and other divine artifacts: the *Five Dragons’ Seal*, the *Nine Luminous Pearls*, and the *Nine Heavens’ Tallies*. These served as military tokens and five-colored whetstones to distinguish the five directions.\n\nThe Emperor then led the feudal lords into battle once more. Chiyou marshaled specters and demons into his ranks, with the Rain Master and Wind Earl as his guards. The Responding Dragon hoarded water to assail the Emperor.\n\nThe Emperor subdued them all, vanquishing Chiyou upon the wilds of Absolute Rein and the lands of Central Ji. His limbs were severed and buried in four separate mounds. Thereafter, Yu Gang defied the Mandate, and the Emperor slew him upon the plains of Banquan. He drove the Xunzhai northward, pacifying the Four Directions, traversing the Four Poles—a journey of twenty-eight thousand li—before casting the Nine Tripods and establishing the Nine Provinces. He appointed ministers of the Nine Ranks and Nine Virtues to observe the heavens and earth, to sacrifice to the hundred spirits, and to promulgate laws and teachings. Then, gathering copper from Mount Shou, he cast the tripods beneath Mount Xing. A yellow dragon descended to receive him, and the Emperor ascended to heaven upon its back. All this was achieved through the talismans, strategies, and diagrams bestowed by the Mysterious Woman to aid his great enterprise.\n\nIn ancient times, the Shu region had the Silkworm Ancestor, Can Cong. During the reign of Gao Xin, there lived in Shu a Silkworm Maiden, whose surname is unknown. Her father was carried off by raiders, leaving only his horse behind. Grieving for her father, the maiden refused to eat, and her mother swore before all: \"Whoever brings my husband home shall have this daughter in marriage.\" Hearing these words, the horse reared in astonishment, broke free of its bonds, and galloped away. Days later, the father returned, riding the very same horse. From that day, the horse neighed incessantly and would not be stilled. The mother recounted her vow to the father, who replied: \"A vow made to men cannot bind a beast. How could a human wed one of another kind? Though it saved me from peril, its deed was great, the oath cannot be fulfilled.\" The horse continued to prance wildly, and in anger, the father slew it, flaying its hide and drying it in the courtyard. Suddenly, the hide leapt up, wrapped the maiden within it, and flew away. Ten days later, the hide came to rest upon a mulberry tree, and the maiden transformed into a silkworm, feeding on the leaves and spinning cocoons to clothe mankind. One day, the Silkworm Maiden descended upon clouds, riding that very horse, attended by thousands of guards. She spoke to her parents: \"The Supreme One, seeing my heart unwavering in righteousness, has granted me the rank of Celestial Consort of the Nine Palaces. Do not grieve for me.\" Her tomb now lies at the border of three counties—Shiyu, Deyang, and Han Prefecture—where each year, those who pray for silkworms gather from all directions. In Shu’s customs, temples and shrines sculpt her image draped in horsehide, calling her the Horse-Head Maiden, to invoke blessings for sericulture.\n\nThe *Rites of Zhou*, in the *Offices of Summer*, states that the Horse Assessor oversees horse transactions and adjudicates disputes, forbidding the raising of \"original silkworms.\" Zheng Xuan’s commentary explains: \"Original means second. The celestial sign of Chen governs horses; the *Silkworm Book* says silkworms are the essence of dragons. When the moon aligns with the Great Fire, their eggs are bathed. Thus, silkworms and horses share the same qi, and things cannot both be great. The prohibition on second silkworms is to avoid harming horses.\" From this discourse, the affinity between silkworms and horses is evident, and there must be those in the world who delve deeply into its principles. The Dao records this singular account in anticipation.\n\nCloud Radiance Lady.\n\nWhen Yu of Xia governed the waters, dredging rivers along the mountains, the Venerable Lord dispatched Cloud Radiance Lady to assist him in secret. At the time, Yu had stationed himself beneath Mount Wu, when a great wind suddenly arose, shaking cliffs and valleys, its force uncontrollable. Suddenly, he encountered Cloud Radiance Lady, and Yu bowed, seeking her aid. The Lady then compelled her attendants to bestow upon Yu the *Book of Summoning Ghosts and Spirits*, and commanded her divine ministers—Kuang Zhang, Yu Yu, Huang Hui, Da Yi, Geng Chen, Tong Lü, and the Giant Spirit—to assist him in hewing stone, dredging waves, blocking torrents, and guiding currents.\n\nYu once paid homage to Cloud Radiance atop the summit of Chong Sou. In the blink of an eye, she transformed into stone. At times, she would suddenly soar aloft, scattering into wispy clouds, then gently coalescing into evening rain. Now a roving dragon, now a soaring crane, her thousand forms and myriad shapes defied approach. Yu suspected her of cunning trickery, deeming her no true immortal. He inquired of Tong Lü, who replied: \"The root of Heaven and Earth is the Dao; the function of the Dao is wielded by the sage. Among the ranks of sages are Perfected Ones and Immortals. Some, endowed with primordial qi, attain the Dao without cultivation—such are Wood Lord and Metal Mother, the progenitors of the Two Qi, the origin of yin and yang, the sovereigns of the immortals, and the primal source of creation. Cloud Radiance Lady is the daughter of Metal Mother. *The Marvelous Records of the Immortals* states her name is Yao Ji. She received scriptures and became Lady of the Upper Palace of Cloud Radiance, presiding over the instruction of youthful Perfected Ones. Her abode is the Terrace of Jade Reflection, where her transformations in concealment and manifestation are her constant nature. For she coalesced from congealed qi, uniting with the Dao in form—not born of womb or endowed with mortal transformation, but the qi of the Lesser Yin of Western Radiance. Moreover, qi pervades Heaven and Earth, animating the animate and inanimate, encompassing creation in its vastness, penetrating even the finest hair. In man, it is man; in things, it is things. How could it be confined to clouds and rain, dragons and cranes, soaring geese or ascending phoenixes?\"\n\nYu was convinced and sought her again. Suddenly, he beheld a terrace of cloud and jade, its jasper towers resplendent, with spirit-officials standing guard, their forms beyond naming. Lions held the gates, celestial steeds cleared the path, venomous dragons and lightning beasts arrayed in eightfold majesty before her chariot. The Lady sat in repose upon the jasper terrace. Yu prostrated himself and inquired of the Dao. She summoned him to sit and said: \"When the sagely artisan first arose, he split the great undifferentiated simplicity into countless forms, unfurled the vast storehouse’s single bud into boundless things. Thus, he paced the Three Luminaries to establish the sundial’s shadow, demarcated the Nine Regions to govern states and kingdoms, carved clepsydrae to divide day and night, used cold and heat to fix the year’s reckoning, aligned kan and li to rectify the cardinal directions, separated mountains and rivers into yin and yang, gathered the people within city walls, forged weapons to defend the multitude, fashioned carriages and robes to distinguish noble and base, and cultivated millet to prepare for famine. All these institutions draw their pattern from above from the stars and constellations, and from below take their model from the divine Perfected. Thus, the sun and moon have their obscurity and brightness, life and death follow cold and heat, thunder and lightning have their times of emergence and retreat, wind and rain their rhythms of movement and stillness. Kindred qi floats above, while manifold essences scatter below. The cycles of rise and fall, the turns of order and chaos, the natures of worthy and foolish, the dispositions of good and evil, the qi of firmness and softness, the fates of long and short life, the stations of noble and base, the ranks of high and low, the omens of fortune and misfortune, the junctures of success and failure—all these are endowed by the Dao, suspended from Heaven, and made manifest by the sage.\n\n\"Nature arises from Heaven, but destiny is fulfilled by man. Heaven establishes it; the Dao enacts it. Where the Dao abides, there is being; where it departs, there is nothing. Without the Dao, things cannot endure. Without cultivation, the Dao cannot be attained. The Most High has said: 'Attain utmost emptiness, preserve profound stillness, and the myriad things will revert of themselves.' To revert is to return to the Dao, to abide perpetually. The function of the Dao is inexhaustible in its ten thousand transformations. Thus, Heaven partakes of the Threefold Mystery, Earth of the Primal Yellow, and man of virtue and power. Beyond these, there is no Dao.\n\n\"The essentials of longevity are these: Heaven preserves its mystery, Earth guards its things, and man nurtures his qi—thus is wholeness maintained. Then my life is in my own hands; neither Heaven and Earth slay me, nor ghosts and spirits harm me, but I lose the Dao and perish of myself. Be steadfast! Be diligent! Your merit extends to all things, your toil reaches even me, your virtue moves Heaven—yet you have not heard the Supreme Dao.\n\n\"Long ago, at the Purple Clarity Gate, I received scriptures and treasured them with diligence. My master, the Three Primordials Lord of the Dao, said: 'The *Inner Scripture of the Supreme Perfected* is the treasure of the Heavenly Perfected. Seal it in a golden terrace, wear it at the Great Tenuity, and clouds will convey you upward while divine tigers guard the gates. Shake out your robes in the jasper chamber, roam and feast in the rare groves, ever summoning the Immortal Lords. On the right, dwell upon White Mountain and gaze down upon the Great Void. Drift upon the Celestial Ford, riding clouds and driving dragons; wander these famous mountains, and the Perfected will visit your chamber. Ten thousand spirits attend you, a thousand essences welcome you. In motion, you ride the Eight Radiance Jade Chariot; in stillness, you repose in the Golden Hall.' This is also called the wondrous scripture of the *Jade Girdle and Golden Pendant of the Most High*.\n\n\"You seek to cross vast seas without a swift vessel, traverse flying sands without a cloud-borne chariot, tread treacherous paths without a carriage, ford muddy waves without a boat. On land, you will be wearied by distant barriers; on water, you will fear drifting and sinking. Yet you would guide the hundred valleys and dredge the myriad rivers—how perilous and distant is your task! The Most High pities your utmost devotion and will bestow upon you the *Numinous Treasure True Writ*, to command tigers and leopards on land, subdue dragons in water, sever the roots of myriad evils, restrain the multitude of malevolence, and accomplish your work. This lies within the Heaven of Yang Brightness.\n\n\"The precious scripture I bestow can also enable you to enter and exit fire and water, roar and summon the netherworld, command tigers and leopards, call forth the Six Dings, conceal yourself in the Eight Earths, invert the Five Stars, prolong vision and preserve the body, and align with Heaven and Earth in duration.\"\n\nThen she commanded the attendant maiden Ling Ronghua to bring forth the cinnabar-jade casket, open the *Precious Writ of Supreme Purity*, and bestow it upon Yu. She further ordered the gods Kuang Zhang and Ju Ling, among others, to assist Yu in slaying those who harmed the people—beings beyond mortal strength to subdue. The execution of Fangfeng at Kuaiji and the shackling of Wuzhiqi, the spirit of the Huai and Wo rivers, beneath Tortoise Mountain were among their feats. Later, Yu entered the Grotto-Heaven of Yang Brightness and became the Perfected One of the Purple Court.\n\nChang’e begged the Elixir of Immortality from the Queen Mother of the West; her wife, Heng’e, stole and consumed it, fleeing to the Lunar Palace. The Weaving Maiden corresponds to the celestial asterism above, while the Herdboy is the River Drum. An old account tells that the Celestial River connects with the sea: in the Han era, a man dwelling by the sea would see rafts floating to and fro each eighth month, never failing their appointed time. A man of extraordinary ambition built a flying pavilion atop one, stocked ample provisions, and rode the raft away. After more than ten days, he reached a place with walled cities and well-ordered houses. Gazing afar into a chamber, he saw a woman weaving. Another man appeared, leading an ox to drink. Startled, they asked, “How have you come here?” The traveler explained his purpose, then inquired, “What is this place?” They replied, “Go to Shu Commandery and seek Yan Junping—he will know.” Upon his return, he asked Junping, who said, “On such-and-such a day of such-and-such a year, a guest star trespassed upon the Herdboy asterism. By my reckoning, that was precisely when you reached the Celestial River.”\n\nThe *Divine Marvels of Dongfang Shuo* records: Guo Han once encountered the Weaving Maiden descending into his chamber. She wore a gown of dark auroral silk and a cloak of frost-spun gauze, a golden crown with phoenix plumes, and slippers embroidered with ninefold jade patterns. She unfurled a canopy of cinnabar mist and cinnabar valley, spread a mat of ninefold crystalline jade, turned a fan of converging winds, and rested upon a pillow of entwined dragons. The next day, she inscribed a strip of azure silk with cinnabar and lead, leaving it for Han.\n\nThe *Book of Han* states: Dong Yong lost his mother in youth. His father, impoverished, hired out his labor to farmers.\n\nThe moon pushed her father in a small cart to the shade beneath a tree at the field’s edge, where she tended to his needs while managing the farmwork. After her father’s death, she borrowed ten thousand coins from her master, selling herself into servitude to obtain the funds for his burial. On her return journey, she suddenly encountered a woman of refined and dignified bearing who offered to become Yong’s wife. Yong then brought her to his master, who commanded the wife: “Weave six hundred bolts of silk, and I shall release you and your husband.” She sat at the loom and completed the task in a single month. The master, astonished by her swiftness, set them free. Following her husband to the place where they had first met, she took leave of him, saying: “I am the Weaving Maiden of Heaven. Moved by your utmost filial devotion, the Celestial Emperor sent me to aid you in repaying your debt.” With these words, she ascended into the void and departed. To this day, in Taizhou, the Well of Heavenly Maid’s Silk-Spinning Noise remains at the site of Dong Yong’s former dwelling.\n\nThere is also the tale of the Weaving Maiden marrying the Herdboy, recorded in the preceding chapter’s *Biography of Wu Ding*.\n\n**Chang Rong**\nChang Rong was the daughter of a Shang king. She cultivated the Dao at the foot of Mount Chang, subsisting on the roots of *pengmeng*. She moved freely between earth and sky, and for over two hundred years, those who saw her found her countenance ever youthful, as if scarcely twenty. She gathered purple grass, which she supplied to dyers, and with the money earned, she aided the poor and sick. Year after year, she did thus, and many came to offer sacrifices at her shrine, yet none knew the Dao she practiced. She often walked at midday without casting a shadow.\n\nSome say Chang Rong was one who refined her form. Soon after, she suddenly ascended to heaven, as recorded in the *Liexian Zhuan*.\n\n**Nü Ou**\nNanbo Zikui asked Nü Ou, \"You are advanced in years, yet your complexion remains that of a child. How is this so?\"\nShe replied, \"I have heard the Dao.\"\nNanbo Zikui said, \"Might I learn it?\"\nShe answered, \"How could you? You are not the right person. Now, Pulian Yi possesses the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage, while I possess the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, that he might perhaps become a sage. Otherwise, to impart the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy indeed. Yet I guarded and instructed him thus: after three days, he could put the world outside himself. Having put the world outside himself, I guarded him for seven more days, and he could put things outside himself. I then guarded him for nine more days, and he could put life outside himself. Having put life outside himself, he could then attain morning clarity. With morning clarity, he could perceive the solitary. Perceiving the solitary, he could transcend past and present. Transcending past and present, he could enter the realm of neither death nor life. That which kills life does not die; that which gives life does not live. It is that which neither sends forth nor welcomes, neither destroys nor completes—its name is *yingning*. *Yingning* is that which achieves only after gradual refinement.\"\nNanbo Zikui asked, \"From whom did you alone hear this?\"\nShe replied, \"I heard it from the son of *Fumo*, the son of *Fumo* heard it from the grandson of *Luosong*, the grandson of *Luosong* heard it from *Zhanming*, *Zhanming* heard it from *Niexu*, *Niexu* heard it from *Xuyi*, *Xuyi* heard it from *Yushu*, *Yushu* heard it from *Xuanming*, *Xuanming* heard it from *Canliao*, *Canliao* heard it from *Yishi*.\"\n\n**Li Zhenduo**\nLi Zhenduo was the younger sister of the immortal Li Babai.\n\nLi Zhenduo followed her brother in cultivating the Dao, dwelling in the bamboo groves of Mianzhu. The Lord Lao and the Three Masters of Remote Antiquity descended to transmit to her the Way of Ascension, and she preceded her brother by ascending to heaven in broad daylight. Her ancient traces remain to this day. Sometimes she comes and goes by the side of Mount Fu, now called the Transformation of Zhenduo—this was once the ancient seat of governance at Mount Fu. Another account states that the Eight Hundred once came with his sister Zhenduo to divine a dwelling at Wulong Ridge in Yunyang, also called Red Shang Stockade, which is now the prefectural seat of Ruizhou. They later refined the elixir in a stone chamber on Mount Hualin, now the Floating Cloud Abbey in Fengxin County, Longxing Prefecture. Though the brother and sister were both from Shu, even after settling in Yunyang, they frequently traveled back to Shu. One day, Zhenduo arrived from Shu, and the Eight Hundred awaited her—this is now the Gate of Gazing for Immortals in Ruizhou. Seeing Zhenduo holding a lotus flower and appearing pregnant, the Eight Hundred grew furious and intended to draw his sword and strike her. Sensing his intent, Zhenduo suddenly soared into the air and crossed the river, where she gave birth to a child and a scroll of scripture. Then, riding the cloud-qi, she slowly ascended to heaven. The people of the time sculpted an image of Zhenduo to enshrine and worship her. When the statue was completed, it would not move. That night, Zhenduo appeared in a dream, saying: \"My shrine should be on Wulong Ridge.\" The next day, the statue became remarkably light, and so they enshrined it there. In the tenth year of the Tianbao era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the Heavenly Master Sun Zhidong first memorialized to rename it Yuanyang Abbey, to manifest its sacred traces. In the seventh year of the Yuanhe era of Emperor Xianzong, the magistrate of Gao’an County, Shen Ben, exchanged the county seat with the abbey’s grounds. Today, two *li* west of Ruizhou city, on Xiaoyao Mountain, stands Miaozhen Abbey. The place where she gave birth to the scripture is now called Yitian Abbey. Within the abbey, female immortals have transmitted her scripture through the generations. The people of the prefecture, whenever preparing incense offerings, visit the abbey to view the scripture, seeking protection from difficult births. Zhenduo is now titled the Radiant Incense Primordial Sovereign.\n\n**Ying Nü**\nYing, the daughter of Duke Mu of Qin, was named Nongyu. Skilled in playing the *sheng*, she had no equal and wished to find a match who could play alongside her. There was a man named Xiao Shi, who excelled at playing the *xiao* and could summon the clear wind, colored clouds, and phoenixes. Nongyu desired to marry him. When she played the *sheng*, it was as if she, too, could summon what Xiao Shi did. Thus, Mengming served as the matchmaker and Saisu as the master of ceremonies, and the marriage was arranged. They feasted in the Western Palace, where no other music was performed—only the two of them played the *sheng* and *xiao* in alternation, eventually summoning phoenixes to alight. The two then rode them away. The people of Qin later built the Phoenix Maiden Shrine in her honor.\n\n**The Solar Maiden**\nThe Solar Maiden, surnamed Zhu and named Yi, expounded upon the Way of the Five Phases, refining and augmenting it until it became most subtle and wondrous. Those who practiced her Way saw swift verification.\n\nAt the age of two hundred and eighty, her complexion remained like peach blossoms, her lips as if holding cinnabar, her skin plump and lustrous, her brows and temples delicately painted—appearing no older than seventeen or eighteen. She served Master Juedong faithfully, and upon the completion of his elixir, he bestowed it upon her, allowing her too to ascend as an immortal.\n\n**The Lunar Maiden**\nThe Lunar Maiden, surnamed Lu and named Quan, was of keen intelligence and surpassing wisdom. She favored the Way of Master Yüzi and had gained some mastery of its methods. Yet unable to attain its subtleties, and lacking an enlightened teacher, she would set up a wine stall along the road, secretly seeking the worthy. Year after year, night after night, she found none who surpassed her.\n\nOne day, Master Taiyang sighed aloud: *\"She follows the White Tiger and the Excessive Serpent, while I follow the Azure Dragon and the Dark Warrior. In this vast world, who truly understands?\"* Hearing this, the maiden rejoiced greatly and sent her younger sister to question the traveler: *\"What is the number of earth?\"* He replied: *\"I do not know. But south is three, north is five, east is nine, west is seven, and the center is one.\"* Her sister returned and reported: *\"The traveler is a sage of the highest virtue, a true Daoist master. I asked but one question, and he answered five!\"*\n\nThereupon, the maiden invited him into her chamber of the Way, where she refined her studies and composed wondrous treatises. She prepared a lavish feast of rare delicacies to honor him. When she humbly presented herself as his disciple, Master Taiyang said: *\"We both serve in the court of the Heavenly Emperor, drink together from the waters of divine radiance, ascend as the foremost of Master Yü’s disciples, and embody the treasures of the Five Phases. I cherish only the worthy—how could I find you strange?\"* He then taught her the essentials of supplementation and guidance, imparted the method of steaming the elixir, and when she compounded and ingested it, she attained immortality. Though she was already two hundred years old, her appearance became that of a youthful child.\n\n**The Hairy Woman**\nThe Hairy Woman, also called Yüjiang (or some say Yümei), dwelled in the Hua Yin Mountains. Hunters and mountain travelers generation after generation beheld her, her body covered in hair. She claimed to have been a palace woman of Qin Shihuang, who fled into the mountains to escape disaster when the Qin fell.\n\nThe Daoist Gu Chun taught her to eat pine needles, whereupon she suffered neither hunger nor cold, her body became as light as flight, and she lived for over one hundred seventy years. Wherever she dwelt in the cliffs, the sound of zither music would issue forth, as recorded in *The Lives of the Immortals*.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: During the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han, hunters in the Zhongnan Mountains saw a person without clothing, her body entirely covered in black hair, leaping over gullies and ravines as if flying. They secretly observed her whereabouts, surrounded her, and captured her. She was a woman who, when questioned, said: \"I was a palace woman of Qin. When the rebels besieged the pass, the Qin king surrendered, and I fled in terror into the mountains. Starving and with nothing to eat, I was on the verge of dying from hunger when an old man taught me to eat the leaves and seeds of pines and cypresses. At first, they were bitter and astringent, but later I grew accustomed to them and no longer suffered hunger. I do not feel the cold in winter nor the heat in summer.\" This woman was from Qin and had lived over three hundred years by the time of Emperor Cheng.\n\nAnother account says there were two women, Yu Daochao and Yu Daoyuan, both female transcendents from the Qin era who concealed themselves in the Wuyi Mountains. Later generations often saw them. The land there was entirely surrounded by hairy bamboo, so people, following the name of the bamboo, also called these two Yu women \"Hairy Women.\"\n\n**Mei Gu**\nMei Gu was a native of Danyang County during the Qin dynasty. She possessed Daoist arts and could walk upon water wearing clogs. A temple to Mei Gu still stands in the county.\n\n**Nü Ji**\nNü Ji was the wife of a wine merchant surnamed Chen.\n\nA transcendent once passed by her home and left five volumes of plain-script texts as collateral for wine. Nü Ji opened and examined them, discovering they were immortal recipes. She secretly copied the essential formulas and cultivated herself accordingly. Several years later, the transcendent returned and, smiling, said: \"To learn in secret without a teacher is like having wings but never flying.\" Nü Ji then followed the transcendent away, and the mountain where she dwelled is now called Nü Ji Mountain.\n\n**Sun Shi**\nSun Shi—also recorded as Yong Shi—was the wife of Han Dynasty Celestial Master Zhang Daoling. Together they concealed themselves in Dragon-Tiger Mountain to cultivate the Dao. In the second year of Emperor Zhang’s *Yuanhe* reign, they both journeyed to Shu and resided in Yangping, where the transformation took place. The Celestial Master’s cultivation reached completion, and in the second year of Emperor Huan’s *Yongshou* reign, on the ninth day of the ninth month, a decree from the Most High arrived. Sun Shi ascended with the Celestial Master in broad daylight upon Cloud Terrace Peak. The *Three Caverns Pearl Bag* states that one year after the Celestial Master’s ascension, his wife likewise ascended to heaven.\n\n**Zhang Wenji**\nZhang Wenji was the eldest daughter of Celestial Master Zhang Daoling. She married Lord Yuan of Chen Commandery, whose family was wealthy and fond of the Dao. After a long time, she ascended to heaven in broad daylight, embracing her five children.\n\n**Zhang Wenguang**\nZhang Wenguang was the second daughter of Celestial Master Zhang Daoling—also recorded as his fourth daughter. She became the consort of Prince Ling. Upon receiving her title, she violated her father’s taboo name and refused to eat for several months before ascending to heaven in broad daylight. Another account says that three days after entering the palace, she ascended in broad daylight from the palace hall.\n\n**Zhang Xian**\nZhang Xian—also recorded as Xian Ji—was the third daughter of Celestial Master Zhang Daoling, or his fifth daughter in another record. She became the consort of the Prince of Yan. Fond of the Dao, she gathered the methods of perfected beings and, after a long time, ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\n**Zhang Zhi**\nZhang Zhi—also recorded as Fang Zhi—was the fourth daughter of Celestial Master Zhang Daoling, or his sixth daughter in another record. She married the second son of the Duke of Wei. Her husband inadvertently violated her father’s taboo name, causing her deep distress. She ascended in broad daylight from her home.\n\n**Lu Shi**\nLu Shi was the wife of Zhang Heng, the second-generation Celestial Master of the Successive Han. When Zhang Heng attained the Dao, Lu Shi ascended with him in broad daylight upon Yangping Mountain.\n\n**Zhang Yulan**\nZhang Yulan was the daughter of Zhang Heng.\n\nFrom childhood, she was pure and abstemious, refraining from meat and blood. At seventeen, she dreamed of a crimson light entering her mouth and consequently conceived. Her parents reproached her, yet she refused to speak of it, and only her handmaid knew the truth. One day, she said to her handmaid, \"When I die, you must cut open my belly to prove my innocence.\" That very night, she passed away. Her parents, not defying her words, opened her abdomen and found an object resembling a lotus in first bloom, within which lay ten scrolls of white silk inscribed with golden script—the *Benji Jing*. Over ten days later, a great storm arose with darkness and gloom, and the scriptures vanished.\n\nThe *Record of Chengdu* states: The Celestial Master’s great-granddaughter conceived without a husband, and her father suspected her, intending to kill her. After she gave birth, a strange light appeared, revealing a scroll—the *Benji Jing*. Her father, deeming it divine, cast aside his blade. Later, she ascended to immortality at Dunxin Village, where the Lady’s Temple now stands. To this day, the Sacred Maiden’s Terrace, the Blade-Discarding Pool, and the Scripture-Washing Pool remain. Another account says she obtained ten scrolls of the *Benji Jing* written on white silk with golden script, each scroll over two feet long and six or seven inches wide, the characters radiant and wondrous, seemingly not of human craft. The scriptures were copied and buried with Yulan. Over a hundred days later, a great storm with thunder and rain arose, and both the scriptures and Yulan disappeared. The grave opened of its own accord, leaving only an empty coffin.\n\n**Qu Girl**\nDongwu Ge Xian’gong Xuan was cultivating on Purple Canopy Mountain in Jingmen Prefecture. During a bitter cold freeze, the immortal’s feet were swollen, his clothes tattered. Two daughters of the Qu family, seeing this, pitied his endurance of the cold and secretly crafted a pair of shoes for him overnight. The next day, intending to present them, they went to his alchemical site, but the immortal had already departed, leaving only warm furnace ashes. The two sisters sifted through the ashes and found a single elixir pellet, which they divided and consumed. Thereafter, their spirits soared, and they felt neither hunger nor thirst, yearning only for purity and stillness. Later, they vanished, and people said they had attained immortality.\n\n**Chen the Matron**\nChen the Matron—her given name was Ying—was of unknown origin. She dwelled in Huang Hall of Danyang Prefecture in Jinling, silently cultivating the supreme Dao. She lost track of her age, yet elders across generations saw her, her teeth and hair unaged, her countenance ever youthful. All called her \"Chen the Matron,\" deeming her worthy to be a teacher of others. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Wu, she walked through the market of Danyang when she suddenly encountered a boy of fourteen or fifteen, who knelt and bowed twice, wishing to become her adopted son. Chen the Matron said to him, \"Now that you have grown, you must care for your birth parents. How can you abandon them to serve me as a mother? Since we are not of the same kind, this does not accord with the great Dao.\" Thereupon, the boy knelt, expressed his gratitude, and departed.\n\nA month or so later, she again passed through the market and suddenly saw a child of about three, weeping and wailing, no one knowing whose son he was. When he encountered Chen the Matron, he clutched her robe and would not let go, pleading, \"Where has my mother come from? I beg your pity.\" Taking pity on his helplessness, Chen the Matron took him in and raised him. As he grew, he served her with sweet delicacies, never failing in his morning and evening duties. His heart merged with the Dao, and his conduct reached the gods. His wisdom surpassed others, and he mastered the classics and histories. He delved into astronomy, geography, the Hundred Schools, and the Nine Streams, exhausting the mysteries of things and probing the subtle and profound.\n\nWhen he neared twenty, the Matron said to him, \"I have long cultivated and followed the true Dao. You were raised by me, and this bond is but temporary. Since you have no heavenly origin, what surname will you take?\" The youth replied, \"Once, the Heavenly Perfected bestowed upon me a sacred writ, appointing me as the Filial and Fraternal Luminous King. May I take this as my name?\" The Matron said, \"Since the Heavenly Perfected has entrusted this to you, how dare I oppose it?\"\n\nThey then discussed marriage, but the youth knelt before the Matron and recited a hymn: \"I am no mortal of this world, but a lofty immortal of the upper realms. Now as your son, this is but an old bond from past lives. Through this, I fulfill the Way of filial piety and deliver all divine immortals. The fifteen youths before me were also my transformed bodies. Now that my Dao and qi are complete, I shall return to my true form. The true and the mundane follow different paths—why discuss marriage? Rather, let us at the Huang Hall altar transmit the teaching to a worthy one. Once you have spread my teaching, my spirit shall dwell in the Three Clarities.\"\n\nHearing this hymn, Chen the Matron was filled with awe and reverence. She then established an altar at Huang Hall, reverently maintaining its incense and flame, and widely propagated the teaching of the Filial and Fraternal Luminous King. The Luminous King instructed the Matron in the secrets of cultivating the true Dao: \"Always ascend to a lofty and secluded altar, sever ties with heterodox factions, steal moments on hills and mounds, ingest the warmth of yang, entrust your mirror to the great void, and still your mind in the mystic garden. Without the Wuying Precious Canopy, the Yellow Elder’s Jade Writ, the Great Cavern Scripture, or the Supreme Hidden Dao of the Seven Radiant Ones of the Vast Expanse, one cannot recline in the chariot of drifting rosy clouds or gaze upon the Terrace of Literary Florescence. Those who attain this Dao will hear the nine phoenixes sing in unison, their myriad cries ceasing only when perfection is reached. They refine the body and master the nodes, the Eight Effulgences float in the void, and dragon chariots with tiger escorts roam the eight directions. Treasure this always.\"\n\nThereupon, she received the wondrous secrets and was also bestowed the sacred writ. Soon after, he bid farewell to his mother and soared into the heavens. Chen the Matron safeguarded and concealed what she had received, and for decades, no one knew of it. By the end of the Western Jin, Xu the Perfected Jun Xun and Wu the Perfected Jun Meng, having heard of the Matron’s attainment of the Dao, journeyed from afar to Danyang to seek her teachings. Knowing their names were recorded in the celestial registers and that they were destined to become immortals, she transmitted to them the teaching of the Filial and Fraternal Luminous King, the lineage of ascending immortals, the Orthodox Unity method for slaying demons, and the art of the Three and Five Flying Steps. She also passed on the bronze talisman and iron charter of the Filial and Fraternal Luminous King, the Golden Elixir Scripture, and the Jade Writs of the Jade Emperor’s celestial registers, all in strict accordance with the original precepts, entrusting them to Master Xu. She further instructed the two Perfected Ones on the ranks of immortals and the hierarchy of divine implements, then commanded Master Xu to transmit the Dao to Master Wu.\n\nThe two Perfected Ones bowed in gratitude and prepared to take their leave. Master Xu wished to pay his respects to the Matron each year, but she stopped him, saying, \"Do not come. I shall soon return to the Emperor’s realm.\" She then took a blade of fragrant grass, faced south, and cast it into the wind, where it flew away. She said, \"When you return, go several dozen *li* south of your dwelling and find where the grass has fallen. There, establish a shrine for me. Visiting once each autumn will suffice.\" As she finished speaking, a cloud-dragon chariot descended to welcome her, and she ascended into the heavens.\n\nToday, at the border of Xinjian and Fengcheng counties, stands the Huang Hall Abbey, built by the Perfected Ones where they sought the Matron in Danyang’s Huang Hall. Every year on the third day of the eighth month, it is the site where they pay homage to Chen the Matron.\n\n**Liu the Immortal Maiden**\nLiu the Immortal Maiden, named Yi, was a native of Jing’an County.\n\nLiu the Immortal Maiden was several hundred years old yet appeared as a child; Matron Chen once praised her. When the Perfected One went to visit, she had already ascended in flight, leaving behind a treasure of a wooden flower-chariot. The chariot rose with the wind and descended after three days, so the abbey was named Flower-Chariot Abbey. Its stele still stands, and it is now called Radiant Cloud Abbey.\n\n**Matron Xu**\nMatron Xu was the elder sister of the Perfected One Xu Xun and the mother of Xu XuLie. As she was widowed, Xu Xun built a chamber for her several dozen paces west of his dwelling, where she resided. While Xu Xun cultivated the Dao in Western Mountain, delving into the profound mysteries day and night, Matron Xu and her son XuLie daily partook of its wonders. Whenever Xu Xun went out, Matron Xu managed his household affairs, and all immortal guests and reclusive visitors were received by her. On the day Xu Xun ascended in flight, Matron Xu and her son XuLie, along with their entire immortal household, received the Jade Emperor’s decree and ascended to heaven.\n\n**The Xu Clan**\nThe Xu clan was the daughter of the Perfected Lord Xu Xun. She married Huang Renlan of Jian’an and fully mastered the Perfected Lord’s Daoist mysteries. Daily she studied the arts of divine transcendence. When Huang Renlan took office as an attendant in Qingzhou, he left Xu behind to serve her parents-in-law. One evening, a servant reported hearing voices and laughter in Xu’s courtyard at night. Her mother-in-law questioned her, and Xu replied, “It was Huanglang.” Her mother-in-law said, “Your husband is thousands of *li* away in office—how could he be here?” Xu said, “He has attained the Dao of immortals and can traverse a thousand *li* in an instant. I was warned against revealing this, so I dared not tell you.” Her mother-in-law said, “If so, let me see him.” That evening, Renlan returned, and Xu told him what had transpired. By dawn, Renlan could no longer conceal it and came forth to greet his parents, saying, “Though I serve in a distant land, I secretly return each night to your side. The Dao of immortals must remain secret, lest I incur punishment and bring you harm.” With that, he took a bamboo staff, transformed it into a green dragon, and rode away. Later, on the day the Perfected Lord Xu Xun ascended lightly into the heavens, Xu, Renlan, and thirty-two members of their household rose into the sky in broad daylight. As the immortal procession departed, a hairpin of Xu’s fell to the earth; the place is now called Xu’s Fallen Hairpin Shoal.\n\n**Master Alchemist Xue**\nThe female immortal Master Alchemist Xue’s origins are unknown. In the Jin dynasty, the world was in turmoil, and the capital was unsettled. Those of the Dao often dwelled in mountains and forests to avoid the world. She resided at Seeking the True Terrace on Southern Marchmount, outwardly mingling with the mundane while inwardly cultivating the utmost Dao. She often rode a white leopard to wander the peaks of Qikuo, with yellow birds and white apes never leaving her side. Later, at Cloud Dragon Peak, she achieved *shijie* and left behind *Immortal Tales: A Supplemental Record*. The *Records of the Xiang Region* state: “The place where the Jin female immortal Master Alchemist Xue ascended is where Emperor Wu of Liang built an abbey in the fifth year of the Tianjian era.” As for the later Zhou Princess Hui, daughter of the Martial Duke of Zhou, she was born with a radiant light filling the room. From childhood, she ate no meat, and as she grew, she longed for solitude, admiring the aspirations of Lady Wei and the Monkey Immortal Maiden. She dwelled in a stone chamber, where the Western Numinous Holy Mother descended to transmit scriptures and records, and she cultivated the Dao of the Three Primes. In the lands of Tan and Heng, hundreds of men and women revered her.\n\nWhen the world was on the brink of chaos, she addressed her disciples, saying: “I shall depart for a time, but will return in roughly a hundred years.” Later disciples gathered like a bustling marketplace. In the early years of the Kaiyuan era under Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the abbey was bestowed the plaque *Western Numinosity*. Thereafter, the Daoist nuns Li Taireal and Cao Miaoben successively attained the Dao, and the abbey that stands today was originally donated by the Zhou Princess. After falling into disrepair, it was revived by the Ma family. The Song court later granted an annual ordination of one Daoist nun to continue the sacred rites.\n\n*The Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Embodying the Dao, Scroll Two, Concludes*\n*The Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Embodying the Dao, Later Scroll, Scroll Three*\n\n**The Lady of Primordial Yang**\n\nThe Lady of Primordial Yang was a disciple of the Dao Lord. Having attained immortality and entered the celestial registers since the most ancient times, she ranked below the Queen Mother of the Golden Terrace. Wherever the Golden Mother descended, she often sent her attendant maidens to accompany her, inviting the Lady as a guest and companion.\n\nEmperor Wu of Han, devoted to the Dao of divine transcendents, offered prayers and sacrifices at renowned mountains to seek spiritual responses. In the first year of the Yuanfeng era, on the seventh day of the seventh month, during the second watch of the night, the Queen Mother of the West descended to the Han palace. The Emperor received her with prostrations and remained standing in attendance for a long while. The Queen Mother bade him sit and presented him with celestial delicacies. After the feast, she prepared to depart. The Emperor descended from his seat, kowtowed, and earnestly entreated her to stay. The Queen Mother resumed her seat and commanded her attendant, Guo Mixiang, to invite the Lady of Primordial Yang to join the banquet in the Han palace—a record of which appears in *The Transmission of the Queen Mother of the Golden Lord*.\n\nIn the fourth year of the Dijie era of Emperor Xuan of Han, Mao Ying of Xianyang received the Ninefold Bestowal of Yellow Gold and was appointed Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, True Lord of Life and Destiny, and Perfected of the Great Prime. At that time, the Five Thearchs had already conferred their decrees and ascended to heaven. The Master of Mao Ying, the Venerable Lord of Total Perfection, along with the Queen Mother of the West and the Lady of Primordial Yang, descended to the Golden Altar of the Hua Yang Heavenly Palace on Mount Juqu, where they held a feast in honor of Mao Ying. Present were Mao Ying’s brothers, Mao Gu (styled the Middle Lord) and Mao Zhong (styled the Lesser Lord). The Queen Mother and the Venerable Lord bestowed upon them sacred instructions and likewise granted them the Ninefold Bestowal. The splendor of the Purple Simplicity ensured Mao Gu’s name in the Register of Destiny. Mao Zhong was appointed Lord of Life Preservation and also attended the assembly of perfected beings.\n\nThe Venerable Lord addressed the two Lords, saying: “The Lady is the Mother of the Three Heavenly Perfected August Ones, the exalted sovereign of Primordial Yang, and overseer of the registers of jade maidens throughout the ten directions. You may present yourselves before her.” The two Lords descended from their seats, bowed twice, and entreated her for the essentials of longevity. Moved by their earnest devotion, the Lady commanded her attendant, Song Bifei, to bring forth a purple brocade satchel. Opening the green-gold clasp, she presented them with four scriptures: *The Scripture of Flowing Pearls of the Three Primes*, *The Scripture of the Essence of the Dao of Cinnabar Scenery*, *The Scripture of the Eight Arts of the Hidden Immortals*, and *The Scripture of the Record of the Supreme Ultimate*.\n\nThe Queen Mother then instructed Li Fangming of the Special Realm to bring forth a cinnabar-jade casket. Opening the cloud-pearl clasp, she revealed *The Scripture of the Jade Pendant and Golden Circlet*, *The Scripture of the Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean*, and *The Inner Writ of the Two Sceneries of Cavern Flight*, which she transmitted to the two Lords. After receiving the texts, the Queen Mother and the Lady took their leave. With a retinue of a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, they ascended back to the Great Void.\n\nThe Lady of the Southern Culmen\n\nThe Lady of the Southern Culmen was the fourth daughter of the Queen Mother of the West—some say the third—named Lin, styled Rongzhen, also known as the Lady of Purple Prime or the Sovereign of the Southern Culmen. She governed the Palace of Great Cinnabar and, having received the scriptures, became the Sacred Lord of the Golden Watchtower, Supreme Guardian of Destiny. During the reign of Emperor Ping of Han, she descended into the stone chamber of Mount Yangluo and transmitted thirty scrolls, including *The Treasured Writ of the Supreme Void* and other scriptures, to the Lord of Pristine Emptiness. The Lady wore a brocade cloak and kingfisher-feather skirt, with a tiger-script talisman at her left and a spirit-summoning seal at her right. Though appearing no older than sixteen or seventeen, her form was flawless, her celestial grace veiled in mist. She rode a feathered treasure chariot drawn by nine dragons, attended by nine thousand female riders. Dwelling in the Longli Mountains amid the Bo Sea of Yangzhou, she presided over the instruction of those destined to become Perfected Ones.\n\nThe Lady of Right Radiance\n\nThe Lady of Right Radiance was the thirteenth daughter of the Queen Mother of the West, named Meilan, styled Shenlin—*The Comprehensive Record of Marvelous Immortals* calls her Zhonglin. She governed Mount Canglang and, having received the scriptures, became the Lady of Cloud Forests. In the third year of the Xingning era of Emperor Ai of Jin, in the seventh month, she descended upon Mount Gouqu—*The Declarations of the Perfected* refers to her as the Lady of Right Radiance of Cloud Forest Canglang.\n\nThe Lady of the Purple Tenuity\n\nThe Lady of the Purple Tenuity, named Qing’e, styled Yuyin—*The Declarations of the Perfected* calls her Yuyi—was the twentieth daughter of the Queen Mother of the West. In times past, she descended to transmit *The Scripture of Treasured Spirits* to the Perfected One of Pristine Spirit, Pei, whose cultivation of its teachings led to transcendence. In the sixth month of the yichou year of the third year of the Xingning era of Emperor Ai of Jin, she descended upon Mount Gouqu alongside the Pacifying Consort of Nine Blossoms, twenty-three Perfected Ones, and fifteen female immortals, imparting the Dao to the Perfected One Yang Xi. The Lady presided over the Dark Wilderness of Feathered Plains, overseeing the instruction of those destined to attain Perfection. Her *Preface to the Garments of the Wooden Sequence* is recorded in the *Scriptures of the Supreme Clarity*.\n\nThe Lady of Grand Perfection\n\nThe Lady of Grand Perfection was the youngest daughter of the Queen Mother of the West. Her robes were wondrously splendid, her beauty unmatched in the world, and she appeared no older than sixteen or seventeen. At times, she served as the Director of the Bureau of Officials in the Palace of the Supreme Lord of the Three Heavens, descending to govern the Eastern Marchmount. The Lady occasionally journeyed to Mount Daizong, where towering cliffs and layered crags formed deep recesses, inaccessible to mortals, rising over a thousand *zhang* above the earth. Within lay jade tables and golden groves, rare treasures of marvelous magnificence. Each time she plucked the strings of her zither, a hundred birds would gather in flight, dancing to her music. Often, she rode a white dragon, circling the Four Seas. The immortal Ma Mingsheng, once a county clerk, was wounded by bandits. His injuries were severe, and he nearly perished.\n\nThe Lady saved him, and several years later, she instructed Mingsheng to study under Anqisheng, receiving the Golden Liquid and Reverted Elixir. Through cultivation, he ascended to heaven.\n\n**Lady Lingzhao of the Li Clan**\nLady Li Lingzhao of the Northern Prime was the daughter of Li Qingbin, the Dark Mystery Dao Lord, and the younger sister of Li Lingfei, the Jade Lad of the Grand Protector. She received the scriptures and became Lady Lingzhao of the Eastern Palace, governing the Thirteenth Vermilion Hall of the Fangzhang Terrace. The Lady wore a robe of purple brocade, bore the talisman of the Divine Tiger, and held a ringing golden bell. She had two attendants, each around twenty years of age. The Lady herself appeared to be thirteen or fourteen.\n\n**Lady Attendant Wang**\nThe female immortal Wang Guanxiang, styled Zhong’ai, was the third daughter of King Ling of Zhou and born of Consort Song. She was the younger sister of Prince Qiao by a different mother. She received from Prince Qiao the Dao of the Flying Goblet and Liberation from the Net, then departed to dwell in the Wei Mountains. Later, she and Prince Qiao entered Luhun, where after thirty-nine years of cultivation, their Dao was perfected, and they ascended to heaven in broad daylight. The *True Reports* states: She received the scriptures and became a lady of the Purple Clarity Palace. The *Inner Transmission* records: The consort oversaw the Eastern Palace, where Lady Attendant of the Realized and Prince Qiao, along with their seven siblings—five sons and two daughters—attained the Dao. Her elder brother of the same womb, Mei Shou, also achieved transcendence.\n\n**Lady Hook-Wing of the Zhao Clan**\nLady Hook-Wing was a native of Qi, surnamed Zhao. From youth, she favored purity and tranquility. She suffered from an external illness for six years, her right hand curled and withdrawn, and she ate little. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, a diviner observing the qi declared: \"In the northeast, there is the qi of a noble person.\" Upon investigation, she was found and summoned. Her beauty and bearing were extraordinary. When Emperor Wu unfurled her hand, he discovered a jade hook within, and her hand straightened. He favored her, and she bore Emperor Zhao. Soon after, she was murdered, and though her body was interred, it remained uncorrupted, exuding fragrance for a month. When Emperor Zhao ascended the throne, he reburied her, but her coffin was found empty, save for a pair of silk slippers. Thus, her palace was named Hook-Wing, later altered to \"Yi\" to avoid taboo.\n\n**Ma Gu**\n\nMa Gu was the younger sister of Wang Fangping, having attained transcendence through the cultivation of the Dao. She appeared to be around eighteen years old, her hair coiled atop her head with the rest cascading down to her waist. Her garments bore intricate patterns, their radiance outshining the sun—such finery was unseen in the mortal world. According to the Daoist scriptures: the Venerable Lord surveyed the boundless realms, witnessing the three disasters, nine calamities, ten perils, and eight tribulations, and revealed the methods to avert them. Among these texts, there are passages dispatching the Black Riders of the North, the celestial hosts, the aged Ma Gu, and five hundred million riders. Thus, it is known that Ma Gu, a high immortal of the great kalpas, has long responded to the turning of the ages.\n\nOnce, when Fangping descended to the home of Cai Jing, he sent a messenger to invite Ma Gu to join the feast. Each prepared their own celestial repast, served on golden platters and jade cups. The delicacies were mostly composed of various flowers, their fragrance permeating both within and without. The sliced unicorn jerky resembled roasted cypress, and the celestial wine poured like ambrosia. Ma Gu remarked: \"Since I began attending to such gatherings, I have witnessed the Eastern Sea transform into mulberry fields three times. When I recently visited Penglai, the waters were shallower than before—perhaps half have already receded, and soon dust will rise again.\"\n\nMa Gu’s fingernails resembled those of a bird’s talons. Cai Jing thought to himself: \"If only I could use these claws to scratch my back, it would be most delightful.\" Fangping, already aware of Jing’s thoughts, immediately ordered a divine officer to flog him, saying: \"Ma Gu is a divine being—how dare you entertain such improper notions!\"\n\nIn Xuanzhou, there stands the Altar of Ma Gu the Immortal; in Jianchang Prefecture, there is Mount Ma Gu. Manifestations of her numinous presence are not confined to a single place. During the *Zhenghe* era of Emperor Huizong of Song, she was honored with the title \"Perfected Sovereign of True Quiescence and Responsive Potency.\" In the *Jiatai* era of Emperor Ningzong, her title was changed to \"Perfected Person of Void Quiescence and Responsive Potency.\"\n\n**Princess of Nanyang**\nDuring the Han dynasty, the Princess of Nanyang married Wang Xian. When Wang Mang usurped power, the princess, who had long admired purity and revered the supreme Dao, often reflected on the governance of Emperors Wen and Jing. Knowing that divine immortals had repeatedly descended during the reign of Emperor Wu, she said to Xian: \"The nation is in peril, and the world is in chaos—this is no time for a woman to offer support. You must preserve your tranquility, withdraw to cultivate the Dao, and distance yourself from the mundane realm to prolong your years. If you blindly follow the times, advancing and retreating with the world, I fear you will not escape the suffering of fragmentation or the afflictions of flight.\" Xian, however, clung to his worldly rank and did not heed her words.\n\nThe princess then built a hut on Mount Hua and dwelled there. After a year, her devotion to the alchemical arts evoked a response from the true spirits, and she abandoned her dwelling to depart. Some witnessed her slowly ascending the ravine, borne upon clouds, drifting gently away. Xian entered the mountains in pursuit, crossing deep gorges and climbing towering peaks, his tears flowing as he gazed into the boundless expanse. Suddenly, upon a ridge, he found a pair of red slippers she had left behind—when he reached for them, they had already turned to stone. Thus, the peak was named Princess Peak. Pan Anren composed an account of this, which circulated in the world.\n\n**Guo Shaoyao**\nGuo Shaoyao was the daughter of Guo Sai, the Han dynasty’s General Who Pacified the Liao. From a young age, she was deeply devoted to the Dao, and a perfected person imparted to her the Six Jia, through which she attained transcendence. Now, she sometimes roams the Dark Pearl Island or resides upon the Terrace of Eastern Splendor in Fangzhu.\n\n**Zhao Aier**\nZhao Aier was the elder sister of Zhao Gai, aide to Liu Yu, Inspector of Youzhou. Fond of the Dao, she attained liberation through *shijie* and later received talismans, whereupon she was seen residing upon the Terrace of Eastern Splendor in Fangzhu.\n\n**Lady Immortal Wang Lulian**\nLady Immortal Wang Lulian was the daughter of Wang Gang, a city gate commandant of Wei under Emperor Ming. (*The Declarations of the Perfected* records her as the daughter of Wang Bogang; it is unclear which account is correct.) Her father attained the Dao on Yuan Isle. Witnessing her father’s ascension to heaven, Wang Lulian devoted herself to cultivation. Entering Lushen Mountain, she encountered the Perfected One of the Great One, who bestowed upon her the method of ascending in broad daylight. Practicing it, she rose to heaven in the full light of day.\n\n**Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount**\nLady Wei, surnamed Wei and named Huacun, styled Xian’an, was a native of Rencheng and the daughter of Wei Shu, Left Vice Director of the Imperial Secretariat under Emperor Wu of Jin. Gifted with extraordinary talent and a nature inclined toward divine transcendence, at the age of twenty-four, her parents compelled her to marry Liu You (styled Yan), then serving as magistrate of Xiuwu. She accompanied him to his post and thereupon requested a quiet retreat in a separate chamber, where she diligently cultivated the Dao. After a hundred days in seclusion, her thoughts fixed upon the immortals, her spirit concentrated in earnest devotion, on a midwinter night, four Perfected Ones descended into her tranquil chamber and transmitted the essential teachings of the Dao. Later, the host of Perfected Ones descended again, instructing her to feign illness and achieve *shijie*. A maple-wheel chariot was dispatched to summon her to the Pure Void Grotto-Heaven of Wangwu, where, by the command of the Heavenly Thearch, she received jade tablets and golden scriptures. She was invested as the Purple Void Primordial Lady, overseeing the life and death registers of all Dao cultivators as Director of the Bureau of Destiny, and charged with adjudicating the merits and transgressions of the Three Officials. She was further ennobled as Lady of the Southern Marchmount, ranking with the Transcendent Lords, and entrusted with governance of the Terrace of the Flowery Pool on Mount Dahuo. In the fourth year of the Xianhe era of Emperor Cheng, a phoenix-wheel chariot descended to welcome her to heaven.\n\nDu Fu’s poem *Gazing at the Marchmount* reads:\nThe Southern Marchmount pairs with the Vermilion Bird,\nIts ritual rank set since the hundred kings of old.\nRevered for its command of earthly spirits,\nIt towers midmost in the fiery southern land.\nThe state upholds its ancestral rites,\nYet virtue, not incense, draws the divine.\nWhere now the imperial progresses of yore?\nYu’s age has long since passed away.\nThrough five turbid kalpas, snared in the world’s net,\nI journey on, crossing Xiao and Xiang.\nThe parched sun emerges from sheer cliffs,\nMy skiff drifts beside the gleaming light.\nZhurong, lord of the five peaks, stands supreme,\nEach peak rising and falling in turn.\nOnly Purple Canopy refuses homage,\nVying in grandeur with its rivals.\nI have heard of Lady Wei,\nAmid the soaring host of immortals.\nAt times, the breath of the five peaks\nScatters on the wind like flying frost.\nBound by the press of my long road,\nI have no leisure to climb the lofty ridges.\nReturning, I long to harness my carriage,\nBathe, and rest in the Jade Hall.\nThrice I sigh and ask the temple warden,\nHow may I offer praise to our august sovereign?\nSacrifices and jades endure in a declining age,\nMay the gods deign to bestow their blessings.\n\nThe Lady’s Altar stands before the central peak of the Southern Marchmount, atop a massive boulder—a great slab of stone, roughly a *zhang* and some in breadth. Its form is square and steadfast, its base rounded, its top flat, resting lightly upon another stone. When a single person presses against it, the stone may turn, yet when many gather, it stands firm and immovable. This is held to be a numinous wonder, and often immortals and recluses come to rest upon it. Strange clouds and sacred *qi* shroud its summit.\n\nThe *Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* states: \"Lady Wei became the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign, governing the Southern Marchmount.\" The *Declarations of the Perfected* records: \"The Supreme Perfected Controller of Destinies is the Perfected of the Southern Marchmount.\"\n\n**Lady An of Nine Flowers**\nLady An of Nine Flowers was an ancient female immortal who attained the Dao. On the night of the fifteenth day of the sixth month in the third year of the Xingning era of Emperor Ai of Jin, the Purple Tenuity Lady Wang descended to transmit the essential Daoist teachings to the Perfected Yang Xi. She arrived accompanied by a divine maiden, clad in cloud-brocade robes, crimson above and azure below, her raiment radiant with luminous patterns. She appeared to be no more than thirteen or fourteen years of age. Flanking her were two attendants: one held a brocade pouch, a foot and two inches in length, containing over ten scrolls. The pouch’s mouth was sealed with a white jade slip, upon which was inscribed: *Inner True Cinnabar Chapters of the Jade Clarity Divine Tiger*. The other attendant bore a white casket bound with crimson cords, its shape resembling ivory.\n\nThe attendant maidens, around seventeen or eighteen years old, were adorned with extraordinary elegance. The divine maiden and her attendants possessed faces of lustrous purity, clear as jade, their fragrance as intoxicating as burning incense or *xiangying* (a foreign perfume). The Purple Tenuity Lady Wang said: \"This is the youngest daughter of Lady Li of the Golden Terrace, a Supreme Perfected of the Great Void. She once journeyed to Tortoise Mountain to study the Dao of Supreme Clarity. Upon its completion, she received the writ of the Most High and was appointed Nine Flowers Perfected Consort of the Purple Clarity Upper Palace.\" Thus, she was granted the surname An, the personal name Yupin, and the style Lingxiao.\n\nWhen the Perfected Consort arrived, she first held three dates in her hand—hued like dried dates but larger in form, without pits, their taste surpassingly sweet. She gave one to Yang Xi to eat. Afterward, the Perfected Consort presented him with a written gift, and the Purple Tenuity Lady Wang likewise composed a text to enlighten him. Once all the Perfected had received their texts, they departed, leaving only the Perfected Consort to linger briefly. She commanded her attendant to open the sealed pouch and withdraw *The Jade Radiance Purple Reflection Inner Contemplation Hidden Writ* and *The Supreme Clarity Returning Dawn to the Childlike Brilliance of the Central Prime*, two scrolls in total—both texts of the Three Primes and Eight Assemblies—which she entrusted to Yang Xi to transcribe. She further said: \"If you cannot endure the trials of wind and fire, and wish to preserve your true form in secluded groves, you may seek the path of sword-release to perform the rites of final departure.\" Later, Yang Xi indeed achieved sword-release and vanished into concealment, eventually ascending in flight.\n\n**Queen Mother of the River’s North**\nThe female immortal Queen Mother of the River’s North was a woman of the Dao, her age unknown. Only the white-haired He, a companion, was ever seen with her. He, styled Zhongli, was an immortal of the Wei dynasty. Whenever he paid homage to the Queen Mother, she would remain seated and bid him cease his bows.\n\nShe would say to others: \"Ah He was a child from my neighborhood, one I watched grow up in my youth.\" At the end of Emperor Wu’s reign in the Jin dynasty, He took his leave, saying: \"I have been summoned by the Kunlun.\" He departed and his whereabouts became unknown. In the second year of Emperor Hui’s *Yuankang* era, an acquaintance saw He in the Hua Yin Mountains, riding a tiger in the retinue of the Queen Mother, accompanied by four or five others whose complexions had grown even more youthful. He sent clear regards to his kin.\n\n**Han Xihua**\nHan Xihua’s origins are unknown. Compassionate toward all beings, he constantly performed hidden acts of merit, even cherishing and protecting the most fragile of lives. Through Daoist cultivation, he attained immortality and now dwells within the Grotto-Heaven of Mount Song.\n\n**Lady Wang Baotai**\nThe female immortal Lady Wang Baotai’s origins are likewise unknown. Having attained the Dao, she became an attendant to the Lord of the Dao of the Prime, residing in the Palace of the Prime Continent. On all four sides of the continent, primordial waves surge to the heavens—no mortal footprint has ever reached it. Once, the Perfected of Pure Emptiness, Wang, followed the Lord of the Western City to ascend this continent, journeying upward to the Celestial Capital and descending to pay homage to the Lord of the Dao of the Prime. The Lord commanded Baotai to unfurl the green jade scrolls and produce the *Dragon Script of Hidden Writings* and the *Eight Numinous Perfected Scriptures*, which she bestowed upon the Perfected of Pure Emptiness.\n\n**Lady Wang Miaoxiang**\nThe female Perfected Wang Miaoxiang entered the Dao in her youth and dwelled at the Yellow Court Abbey on Mount Cangwu. She practiced grain avoidance and qi-absorption, building her hermitage beside the waters of Linxuan. After more than fifty years, her appearance remained that of a woman of eighteen or nineteen. Each time she recited the *Yellow Court*, her sincerity moved the unseen. One day, suddenly, a dense fragrance of numinous incense filled the courtyard, auspicious clouds suffused the grounds, celestial music resounded through the sky, and radiant light illuminated the altar hall. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders descended from the void, their banners and crane canopies heralding the arrival of nine dragon-borne immortals, who alighted before the altar. There appeared a transcendent official in feathered robes and a jeweled crown, a sword at his waist and trailing slippers, who ascended the hall and seated himself, his body emanating five-colored light. Miaoxiang approached to pay her respects, and the transcendent official said to her: \"I am the Lord Shun, sovereign of the ancient Youyu dynasty, who wearied of governing the myriad states and cultivated the Dao upon this mountain. I have long wished to guide and instruct later generations, that they might awaken to the Dao, yet the world holds none worthy of teaching. The Dao resides within, not without; it dwells in your own person, not in another. As the *Mysterious Scripture* says: *Cultivate it in your person, and your virtue shall be true.*\n\nRecently, the Earthly Bureau memorialized that you have dwelled upon this mountain for over thirty years, unwavering from beginning to end, guarding the Dao without deviation, preserving sincerity in your thoughts, and upholding the precepts and commandments. If you have yet to achieve realization, this would be the Dao’s abandonment of you. Yet the *Mysterious Scripture* states: *Ever excelling in saving beings, thus nothing is abandoned.* The Dao’s grace is universally bestowed, desiring the perfection of all things and the salvation of all people. But worldly beings possess meager karmic fruits and shallow Dao-qi, unable to persevere with diligence and constancy. Before the Dao-qi responds, they have already grown weary and desist. Thus, it is people who abandon the Dao, not the Dao that abandons people.\n\nYour single-minded sincerity, your resolve to seek realization across a hundred or a thousand lifetimes without slackening or retreat—this is deeply moving. In the past, I encountered the Most High Lord Lao, who revealed to me the *True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*, teaching the governance of the state and the cultivation of the self, the salvation of beings and the propagation of teachings. These can penetrate heaven and earth, pervade the myriad things, serving as the essence of transformative practice and the foundation of sagely rule. Yet words cannot fully express it. The worldly, mired in superficial deceit, scorn humility and restraint as cowardice, dismiss withdrawal as impractical folly, ridicule the renunciation of sagacity and wisdom as absurd, and deride the abandonment of benevolence and righteousness as perverse. Such is the delusion of this degenerate age.\n\nThe intent of the Mysterious Sages is to restore simplicity and return to the uncarved block, to exalt the Dao and cast out the perverse. Once the crooked paths are cleared away, the Supreme Dao will naturally manifest.\"\n\nOnce simplicity and purity are established, the clamor of competition naturally dissipates. Then the art of regulation and restraint finds no application, the compassion of universal love no place to settle, the brilliance of sagely wisdom no use, and the cunning of deceptive intelligence no scope to operate. The world, in perfect harmony, returns to the Great Compliance—such is the grand aim of the Mysterious Sages.\n\nHaving traversed the cycles of time, I now dwell in this mountain, where I often dispatch immortal officials to teach the people the Dao of enduring vision and non-action. For the exalted sages and perfected beings, moved by the impermanence of kalpas and the ceaseless flux of cosmic eras—where yin and yang alternate, life and death succeed one another—swiftly arrive at the conjunction of the Nine and Hundred-Six, and thus diligently descend to instruct and save humanity, their efforts all the more urgent for those who seek the Dao.\n\nYet those who seek the Dao in the world waver between presence and absence, their thoughts and intentions scattered, scarcely one in ten thousand truly devoted. The celestial perfected, pitying the vulgar, ever dwell among mortals, concealing their radiance and transforming their forms, awakening minds wherever they go.\n\nThis mountain’s nine peaks each bear palaces, governed by true officials. Beneath them lie treasures of jade and the five metals, divine mushrooms and sacred herbs, medicines guarded by the Three Heavens, and scriptures concealed by the Most High. Some rest in stone chambers and jade terraces, others in cloud-wreathed cliffs and secluded valleys, all overseen by spirit wardens, free from venomous creatures or predatory beasts. Here one may transcend the world, nurture life, cultivate the Dao, and ascend to perfection.\n\nSince you have resided here, you have never explored the four directions, nor gazed upon the towering peaks—thus you remain unaware of these wonders. Strive in your practice, and soon you shall ride the light through empty space, then invert the radiance to fathom its origins and ends.\n\nThereupon, I commanded the attendants of the imperial chamber to bestow upon you the *Scriptures of Dao and Virtue* and the *Lingwen of Abiding Radiance* before departing. Thereafter, I descended to the Yellow Court Abbey once a year, or every three to five years. Years later, Miao Xiang ascended to heaven at sunrise, and the abbey where she dwelled was renamed the Abbey of Nurturing the Dao.\n\nThis mountain, where Shun cultivated the Dao, is thus called Daozhou. It was here that the Old Master once transmitted the *Scripture of Dao and Virtue* to Shun—a fact attested by the River Earl, who said: *\"I composed this book one thousand seven hundred years ago.\"*\n\n**Immortal Woman Wang Fengxian**\nImmortal Woman Wang Fengxian was a native of Xuanzhou.\n\nWang Fengxian was born into a poor family, her parents earning their livelihood through farming. At the age of fourteen, while in the fields, she suddenly saw a group of ten or so young maidens in blue attire playing with her. After a long while, they dispersed. The next day, she returned to the same field and saw them again as before. Over a month later, the maidens gathered at her home at night, laughing and talking through the evening until dawn before departing. Sometimes they brought rare fruits to sate her hunger—things not of this world. Though her room was narrow, even with many visitors, it never felt cramped. Her parents grew suspicious and spied on her, but saw nothing. Fearing she was bewitched by some demonic entity, they reproached her severely, yet she always deflected with other excuses. From then on, the maidens visited by day, accompanying her on distant journeys to places far and wide, returning only at dusk. Fengxian gradually ceased eating and drinking, and her strangeness became more apparent. One day, her parents saw her perched atop the bamboo in their courtyard; she leapt down and landed on the ground. When asked the reason, she revealed that the maidens she met were all immortal women, and that she ascended and descended the bamboo to travel to and from the heavens. The maidens also trimmed her hair, cutting it evenly at her brows in front and letting it hang to her shoulders in back, where it ceased to grow. Her skin became smooth and lustrous as ice and jade, her bright eyes and extraordinary features resembling those of a celestial being. Her wisdom and eloquence surpassed others, and her words carried profound and subtle truths. Once, she told a learned person: \"What I have encountered is the Dao; what I have attained is immortality; the women I have seen are all immortal women.\"\n\nEach time she visited the heavenly palaces, she saw the abodes of the highest immortals—many clad in embroidered robes, wearing flowered crowns and holding jade tablets, carrying divine flowers and sacred herbs, chanting sacred verses. Sometimes they ascended to the Cloud Gate or the Mushroom Fields, or wandered through jade palaces and crystal towers, discussing the affairs of attaining immortality and transcending the world. They traveled above the Milky Way, journeying thousands upon thousands of miles. Upon first arriving in heaven, she entered the Palace of Great Abundance, where the Heavenly Worthy resided in a vast hall, attended by countless immortals. Fengxian paid her respects, and the Heavenly Worthy ordered his attendants to present her with a cup of jade nectar, saying: \"You possess the bones of an immortal and are destined to ascend. However, the kalpa of this world is not yet complete, and you shall return here in fifty years. The grains of the earth harm one’s true qi when consumed, and the fruits of trees and grasses diminish one’s lifespan. You should practice grain avoidance and cultivate your true nature.\" From then on, she ate nothing for twenty years.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy transforms in the heavens, governing all things like a father to the world. The World-Honored One transforms in the world, exhorting people to goodness like a mother. The Confucian classics circulate among the world like elder brothers. All people are like infants, knowing only their mother but unaware of the reverence due to their father and elder brothers. Thus, those who understand the Dao are few, and those who esteem Confucianism are rare—this is not surprising. What Fengxian saw in heaven was no different from the Dao of today, and she never beheld any images of bodhisattvas, buddhas, or monks.\n\nFengxian often depicted meritorious deeds in paintings, mostly illustrating the courtly attire of heavenly beings, emperors, and Daoist lords, which she titled *Court of Heaven*. She traveled through the regions of Huai and Zhe, and wherever she went, crowds gathered to see her. Fengxian taught men and women the ways of loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and uprightness, as well as the principles of purity, frugality, and the essentials of cultivating oneself through secret practices. Thus, she was revered far and wide. Gold, jade, treasures, and offerings piled before her, numbering in the tens of thousands, yet she declined them all. Fengxian lived with her two younger sisters on Mount Dongting, later moving to Mount Xiang in Qiantang. Her two sisters and disciples maintained the incense and lamps, constructing magnificent halls without ever faltering in their efforts.\n\nOne day, she passed away at the age of eighteen, fulfilling the fifty-year prophecy. In her daily meditation, she could perceive events a thousand miles away. When she concentrated her thoughts and projected her spirit, she would ascend to the Nine Heavens. As she neared the end of her life, clouds and cranes descended repeatedly, and extraordinary fragrances filled her chamber. After her transformation, her body remained supple and moist, her skin as if still alive. Those who recognized the signs understood this as a *shijie*—a liberation through the simulated death of the body.\n\n**Immortal Woman Wang**\nImmortal Woman Wang was the niece of Prime Minister Wang Huizhi. At the time, her father, a member of the Hanlin Academy, had traveled to the capital on official business, and Wang, along with her mother Pei and her brother Liu, resided beneath the Cassia Crag in the mountains of Yixing, neighboring the Cave Spirit Abbey. From a young age, Wang was drawn to the Dao. She abstained from wine and meat, maintained a dignified demeanor, and delighted in solitude. Sometimes she played the zither for pleasure, or composed poetry and prose for her own amusement. She recited the *Perfect Writ of the Great Cavern*, the *Scripture of Salvation*, and the *Verses on the Dao and Virtue* within her chamber, where an unusual fragrance often lingered, distinct from ordinary scents. Her parents, awed by her, once secretly asked her mother: \"The Grotto Palace has issued a summons, appointing me to an immortal office. I cannot refuse, but I fear I must journey far.\" Her mother did not understand her meaning.\n\nOne day, she fell slightly ill. Pei and Liu, who cherished her deeply, prayed for her at the Cave Spirit Abbey. That day, she improved slightly and accompanied them to the abbey, where they paid homage to the sacred images. Standing in the courtyard, burning incense, she seemed to be making a vow. By evening, they returned home. To the right of the door stood a large rock, upon which she inscribed a poem:\n\n*Endlessly climbing mountains, fording streams,*\n*The immortals descend again to hear my zither’s themes.*\n*This heart holds no love for worldly affairs,*\n*Only the sight of twin cranes soaring through the air.*\n\nThat night, she passed away suddenly. By dawn, a pair of cranes perched in the trees of the courtyard, celestial music filled the sky, and an extraordinary fragrance suffused the fields. The news spread, and people from near and far rushed to witness the marvel. Her body was placed in her chamber, clothed as in life.\n\nFrom that time onward, the entire household maintained pure devotion to the incense and flame, and both elders and juniors cultivated the Dao and embraced its transformation.\n\n*End of Volume Three of* Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao\n*Beginning of Volume Four of* Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao\n\n**The Purple Essence Primordial Sovereign**\n\nThere was a scholar named Ren who dwelled in reclusion on Mount Song. One evening, a beautiful woman arrived and left a poem:\n\n*I dwell in the registers of the Upper Clarity,*\n*Exiled to wander the Five Peaks.*\n*As you bear no worldly burdens,*\n*I come to urge you toward the study of immortals’ arts.*\n\nRen refused to receive her. Three days later, she returned and said, \"I am no spectral phantom but one whose name is listed among the highest immortals. The unseen reckoning has ordained that we be joined as mates.\" She then presented another poem:\n\n*Ge Hong, too, had a wife,*\n*The Queen Mother, too, had a husband.*\n*All immortals are spirit-mates—*\n*What say you, noble sir?*\n\nRen remained silent. The woman continued, \"Ruan Zhao was deluded and failed to awaken—how then shall I express my sincerity?\" She added:\n\n*In the springtime moon above the sea,*\n*The kingfisher plumes return in vain.*\n\nSeveral months later, Ren fell ill and died, only to be pursued by underworld officials. On the road, he encountered a procession of banners and a jade-green palanquin, within which a woman laughed and said, \"This is the ill-fated scholar of Mount Song.\" She took the documents from the officials, examined them, and declared, \"Now that we have met, I cannot be without feeling.\" She seized a brush and wrote a judgment: *\"Grant him three more years.\"* Ren bowed in gratitude. The officials said, \"This is the Purple Essence Primordial Sovereign, the most exalted of the immortal officials.\" They escorted him back, and Ren lived for three more years before passing away. This was a trial sent by a true immortal to test mortals—Ren, having maintained his integrity, was thus granted an extension of three years.\n\n**Zhao Sutai**\n\nZhao Sutai was the daughter of Zhao Xi, Governor of Youzhou during the Han dynasty. Xi had performed many virtuous deeds in his youth, often aiding the destitute and rescuing the Wang Hui clan from execution, accumulating hidden merits in dozens of instances. As a result, he ascended in person to the Vermilion Mound, and his sons gained the ability to vanish and wander the grotto-heavens. Sutai had resided in the Palace of Shifting Transitions for four hundred years and refused to leave, declaring that nowhere else in the world brought her such joy. She often traveled in humble disguise, delighting in the mountains and marshes. The Lady of Shifting Transitions was her equal in rank.\n\n**Huang Jinghua**\n\nHuang Jinghua was the daughter of Huang Qiong, Minister of Works during the Han dynasty. From a young age, Jinghua was devoted to the Dao of immortals and secretly cultivated its essential practices. Later, she became a disciple of Han Zhong, who transmitted to her the elixir formula of Mount Min. After ingesting it, she entered the Palace of Shifting Transitions and was appointed as the Lady of Harmonious Dawn, overseeing the divine women of the Nine Palaces and instructing them in the *True Instructions*. It is recorded elsewhere: Huang Qiong, a native of Jiangxia, styled Shiying, served as Minister of Works, Minister over the Masses, and Grand Commandant during the reign of Emperor Shun of Han. He died at the age of seventy-nine. His father, Huang Xiang, served as President of the Imperial Secretariat during the reigns of Emperors Zhang and He, saving over a thousand lives.\n\nJinghua’s son, Wan, served as Minister over the Masses and Grand Commandant but was killed by Li Quan; it remains unknown whether the Lady had already departed or not.\n\n**Zhou Yuanzhi**\nZhou Yuanzhi was the daughter of Zhou Chang, Prefect of Henan during the Han. Chang, a native of Ancheng in Runan, was devoted to practicing hidden virtue, his merits imperceptible to others. Once, while serving as Prefect of Henan, he encountered a severe drought. He gathered and buried the remains of over ten thousand travelers who had perished along the roads of Luoyang, erecting a communal grave and offering sacrifices. At once, heavy rains fell, bringing a bountiful harvest. Many of his deeds were of this kind. The Most High, recognizing Chang’s hidden conduct, commanded Yuanzhi to receive transformation in the Southern Palace and attain immortality. She now serves as Attendant Gentleman of Luminous Dawn in the grotto-heavens. Yuanzhi, too, had loved the Dao from a young age and ingested *fu ling* for thirty years. Later, she encountered Shi Changsheng, who instructed her in the art of *huadun*—the supreme form of corpse-liberation.\n\nChang was the cousin of Zhou Jia. By nature, he was benevolent, compassionate, and sincere. During the reign of a certain emperor, he served as Prefect of Henan. In the summer of the second year of *Yonghe*, a prolonged drought persisted, and despite repeated prayers, no response came.\n\nHaving thus buried over ten thousand, timely rains fell, and he rose to the rank of Chamberlain for Attendants. From the *True Reports*.\n\n**Zhang Taozhi**\nZhang Taozhi was the mother of Zhu Yu, Han Dynasty Chief of the Secretariat under the Inspector of the Capital, and a native of Pei. When Yu perished, he was executed alongside Chen Fan. His mother, renowned for her hidden virtue, later ascended in the *Yi Qian* Palace to become Attendant Gentleman of Luminous Dawn. From the *True Reports*.\n\nA note states: Zhu Yu, a native of Pei, was one of the Eight Eminences during the reigns of Emperors Huan and Ling. Later, he was implicated among the partisans, and with Li Ying and Mi Zhu, was imprisoned and died—unrelated to Chen Fan’s time.\n\n**Fu Lihe**\nFu Lihe was the daughter of Fu Jian, Emperor Huan’s nephew and Palace Attendant, and a native of Beidi. Her entire family revered the Buddha, and Lihe daily swept before the Buddha’s image, offering earnest prayers and vowing to attain transcendence. She regularly ingested the essence of the Five Stars, her body radiating light, and ascended as an immortal. Skilled in the *Song of Kongtong*, when she sang, birds and beasts would gather and dance before her to listen. Such was the response to her utmost sincerity, through which she attained the Dao. After a long sojourn in the *Yi Qian* Palace, she later presided over the Grotto-Heaven of the *Han Zhen* Terrace.\n\n**Zhang Weizi**\nZhang Weizi was the daughter of Zhang Qing, Han Emperor Zhao’s Superintendent of Works, though her native commandery is unknown. From youth, she loved the Dao and achieved corpse-liberation. She first resided in the *Yi Qian* Palace and later oversaw the Grotto-Heaven of the *Hua Yang Han Zhen* Terrace. Weizi claimed her teacher was Chun Wen Si, Jade Consort of the Eastern Flower Capital of the Eastern Sea, from whom she received the Dao of ingesting mist-qi. She said: \"Mist is the refined essence of mountains, marshes, water, and fire, the overflowing qi of metal and stone. Prolonged ingestion allows one to disperse form and enter emptiness, merging with the clouds.\" Through cultivation, Weizi attained immortality.\n\nThe *True Reports* state: Wen Qi was the younger sister of the Azure Lad. Weizi, through earnest devotion in quiet seclusion, moved the spirits, and Wen Qi descended to her.\n\n**Dou Qiongying**\nBao Qiongying was the younger sister of Bao Wu. Their seventh-generation ancestor, named Zhi, made it his life’s work to bury the unclaimed dead and revive the dying, and thus his blessings extended to Qiongying. She now resides as a female immortal in the *Yi Qian* Palace.\n\n**Han Taihua**\nHan Taihua was the younger sister of Han Anguo and the wife of Li Guangli, Han’s General of the Second Expedition. Having attained the Dao, she resides in the *Yi Qian* Palace. Guangli, owing to past-life merit, now undergoes transformation in the Southern Palace.\n\n**Liu Chunlong**\nLiu Chunlong was the daughter of Liu Fengxian, Han’s Superintendent of the Imperial Clan. Due to her ancestors’ hidden virtue, all achieved transcendence, refining their luminous spirits to enter the *Hua Yang Yi Qian* Palace. Liu Chunlong, Dou Qiongying, Han Taihua, Li Xizi, and Guo Shuxiang—all possessed celestial beauty, unmatched grace, and extraordinary talent and wisdom—were appointed Attendant Gentlemen of Luminous Dawn to dwell within the grotto-heavens. The role of Attendant Gentleman is bestowed upon those of exceptional ability, regardless of gender.\n\n**Guo Shuxiang**\nGuo Shuxiang was the mother of Wang Xiu and attained the Dao in the *Yi Qian* Palace. A note in the *True Reports* states: Wang Xiu, styled Shuzhi, was a native of Beihai and served as Palace Attendant to Emperor Wu of Wei. At seven, he lost his mother, who died on the day of the *She* sacrifice. The identity of Guo’s father remains unknown.\n\n**Sun Hanhua**\nSun Hanhua was the daughter of Sun Xi of Wu. She studied under Master Du Qi, receiving the essentials of the Mysterious and White, and her countenance grew ever more youthful. Traversing the mountains of Wu and Yue for over a decade, she at last attained the immortal Dao and departed. Another account holds that she was the granddaughter of the Great Emperor of Wu and cultivated the Dao on Mount Mao. Upon achieving transcendence, she ascended in emptiness, and the mountain was thereafter named Hua Lao Shan. The mountain stands before the Chongxi Abbey on Mount Mao.\n\n**Wang Jinxian**\nWang Jinxian was the daughter of Wang Yan, Minister of Works under Emperor Wu of Jin, and wife to Prince Yu Huai. When Liu Yao and Shi Le plundered the Jin nobility and crossed the Mengjin Ford of the Yellow River, they sought to take her as a wife. Jinxian cursed them, saying: *\"I am the consort of the Crown Prince and daughter of the Minister of Works. How dare you barbarian whelps presume to touch me?\"* With that, she cast herself into the river. Her maidservant, named Liuchu, then declared: *\"If the great one has done so, the lesser should do the same.\"* And she too leapt into the river. At that moment, the female immortal Han Xihua of Mount Song, who was traveling abroad, took pity on them. She embraced and rescued the two, preserving their lives in secret while outwardly feigning death. Their bodies were secretly conveyed away and taken into Mount Song, where they now dwell within the *Yi Qian* Grotto of the Huayang Palace. Liuchu was then twenty-two or twenty-three years old, of refined appearance and resolute character. Her surname was originally Tian, and she was a native of Yuyang, the granddaughter of Tian Feng, former Prefect of Junyi under Wei. Feng had performed many acts of hidden virtue, which extended to Liuchu. (The *Book of Jin* records a slightly different version.)\n\n**Li Xizi**\nLi Xizi was the grandmother of Li Zhong, Grand Administrator of Dongping under Jin, though her surname remains unknown. Zhong’s grandfather lived in reclusion, his nature marked by compassion and mercy, and he devoted himself to hidden virtue. Xizi was single-minded in her resolve, ever devoted to saving others. In times of heavy snow and bitter cold, she would heap rice and millet in the garden courtyard, fearing that birds might starve. Such was the depth of her care. She now dwells in the Huayang Grotto, having attained the Dao.\n\n**Lady Fan**\nLady Fan was the wife of Liu Gang, Celestial Master of Jin. Once, she and her husband tested their arts while seated in the hall. Gang conjured a fire that burned the tiled roof, beginning from the east, but Lady Fan restrained it, and the flames were extinguished. In the courtyard stood two peach trees. Husband and wife each pointed at one, commanding them to strike each other. After a long while, the tree Gang had fixed his gaze upon faltered and retreated beyond the fence several times. Gang spat into a tray, and it became a carp. Lady Fan spat into the tray, and it became an otter that devoured the fish. When the couple entered the Siming Mountains, their path was blocked by a tiger. Gang restrained it, and the beast crouched motionless, but when they attempted to pass, it roared. Lady Fan strode forward, and the tiger prostrated itself, unable to lift its gaze. She struck it with a rope and led it away, tethering it beneath a tree. Later, when the couple ascended to heaven, Gang had served as Magistrate of Shangyu. In the county hall stood a great honey locust tree, and Gang had to climb several *zhang* up its trunk before he could take flight. Lady Fan, however, rose gently as if borne upon clouds, and together they ascended to heaven.\n\nDuring the *Zhenyuan* era of Emperor Dezong of Tang, there lived an old woman of Xiang who healed illnesses with cinnabar talismans. One day, she told her villagers: *\"I am going to Dongting to save hundreds of lives.\"* The day before she arrived, a great storm arose. A massive boat carrying over a hundred people from Junshan was stranded on an island, where a white turtle emerged from the sand and began devouring them. The next day, a wall of snow encircled the island, gradually tightening until the easterners were herded into a cluster no more than a few *zhang* wide. The people of Yueyang watched from afar, bewildered by the snowy fortress. When the old woman reached the shore, she hurled a flying sword, piercing the white wall with a thunderous crash. It collapsed, revealing a white dragon over ten *zhang* long, writhing in death. Later, a Daoist surmised that the old woman of Xiang was none other than Lady Fan, wife of Liu Gang.\n\n**The Divine Mother of Dongling**\nThe Divine Mother of Dongling was a native of Guangling. She married into the Du clan and studied the Dao under Liu Gang. Skilled in transformation and concealment, she could appear and vanish at will. Practicing the arts of the Central Scripture, she achieved the power to sit in death while standing. Her husband, Lord Du, disbelieved in the Dao and often resented the Divine Mother. She devoted herself to healing the sick and aiding others, but the more she did, the more he raged, slandering her as a sorceress and reporting her to the authorities. When the Divine Mother was imprisoned, she escaped through the window in an instant. The crowd watched as she soared higher and higher into the clouds, leaving behind only a single slipper beneath the window. Thereafter, temples were erected for her far and wide, and the people revered her. Prayers to her were highly efficacious. A green crow often perched at her altar, and if someone lost an item and inquired after it, the crow would fly to alight upon the thief’s head. Thus, the roads were free of lost property. Over time, this ceased. To this day, in Hailing County, no one dares commit theft or villainy—those who do great evil are drowned in wind and waves or devoured by wolves and tigers, while lesser offenders fall ill.\n\n**Yunying**\nPei Hang hired a boat on the Xiang and Han rivers, where he encountered Lady Fan, a woman of peerless beauty. He bribed her maid, Niaoyan, to deliver a poem:\n\n*\"Though north and south share this boat, my heart still yearns,\nA mortal meets a celestial beyond the brocade screen.\nIf you ascend to the Jade Capital for the morning court,\nI would follow the phoenix and crane into the azure heavens.\"*\n\nLady Fan replied: *\"My husband dwells south of the Han. I pray you do not take offense at my jest. Though our bond is slight, one day it shall become a marriage of harmony.\"* She answered with a poem:\n\n*\"A sip of cloud-nectar stirs a hundred emotions,\nPounding frost reveals the elusive Yunying.\nThe Blue Bridge is the abode of immortals—\nWhy trouble yourself with the arduous climb to the Jade Capital?\"*\n\nLater, Pei Hang passed through the Lanqiao Post Station, parched with thirst. An old woman in a thatched hut was spinning hemp when he bowed and begged for a drink. She said: *\"Yunying brings a bowl of nectar.\"* He took it and drank—it was truly ambrosia.\n\nPei Hang said to the old woman: *\"The young lady is breathtakingly beautiful. Would you consent to my marrying her?\"* The old woman replied: *\"This frail old body has but this granddaughter, left behind by an immortal with a single *daogui* of elixir. It must be ground in a jade mortar and pestle for a hundred days to be complete. If you wish to wed her, bring me the jade mortar and pestle, and I shall give her to you in marriage. Gold and silk are of no use to me.\"* Disheartened, Pei Hang departed.\n\nA month later, he indeed obtained the mortar and pestle and returned to the Blue Bridge. The old woman untied the pouch at her waist, took out the medicine, and began to grind it. Pei Hang immediately joined in. That night, as she gathered the medicine into her chamber, Pei Hang glimpsed a jade hare wielding the pestle, its snow-bright radiance illuminating the room. After a hundred days, the medicine was ready. The old woman swallowed it and said: *\"I shall enter the grotto. Prepare the bridal chamber for Master Pei.\"*\n\nSuddenly, a grand mansion appeared, and immortal youths and maidservants led Pei inside. Among the many divine kin, a woman addressed him as her brother-in-law. She said: *\"Do you not recall sailing together at Ezhu, arriving at Xiang and Han?\"* Those around her explained: *\"This is Lady Yunqiao, wife of the Celestial Master Liu Gang and a scribe to the Jade Emperor.\"* Pei took his wife into the Jade Peak Grotto, where they partook of cinnabar snow and jade blossom elixirs, ascending together as transcendent immortals.\n\n---\n\n**Bao Gu**\n\nBao Gu was the daughter of Bao Shuo, Governor of Nanhai, and the wife of Ge Hong, Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary of the Jin Dynasty. Shuo, styled Taixuan, was a native of Chenliu. From youth, he possessed keen insight, penetrating the hidden and obscure. With a mind sunk in profound contemplation, none could fathom his depths. Shuo and his younger sister had accumulated layers of hidden virtue across generations, and their blessings extended to him, allowing them all to attain the Dao. Gu and her younger sister both ascended to the ranks of immortals.\n\nShuo’s learning encompassed the warp and weft of the classics. Later, he studied under Zuo Yuanfang, receiving the Central Scripture and the essentials of summoning the Three Sovereigns and Five Peaks. His practice proved spiritually efficacious, enabling him to command ghosts and gods, seal mountains, and subdue demons. In the first year of *Daxing* (318 CE) of Emperor Yuan of the Eastern Jin, Shuo encountered the Perfected One Yin Changsheng on Mount Jiang and was granted the *daojie* defense. Repeatedly summoned to serve as Gentleman of the Yellow Gate, he sought instead the governorship of Nanhai so that Gu might marry Ge Zhichuan.\n\nZhichuan, formerly Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary, became Magistrate of Goulou County to refine cinnabar. Taixuan, while in Nanhai, saw his youngest daughter suddenly fall ill and die. As he entertained guests at the time, he showed no grief. She was buried on Mount Luofu, her complexion as lifelike as ever—all believed it a case of *shijie*. When Shuo returned to Danyang, he died and was buried at Shizigang. Later, during the rebellion of Su Jun, his tomb was opened, revealing no corpse—only a great sword. When the rebels attempted to take it, they heard the sound of troops and horses on either side of the tomb and fled in terror. From within the tomb came a rumbling like thunder, and the rebels scattered. After the rebellion was quelled, the sword was recovered and reburied.\n\nShuo and his sister had also mastered the art of *shijie*, and Gu and Zhichuan ascended to immortality in succession.\n\nLater, a man named Cui Wei lived in Nanhai. On the *Zhongyuan* Festival, the people of Panyu displayed rare treasures at the temple. Wei went to observe and saw an old woman stumble, knocking over someone’s wine jar. The tavern keeper struck her, but Wei rushed forward and asked: *\"How much is the wine worth?\"* The keeper replied: *\"One string of cash.\"* Wei immediately removed his robe to pay for it, but the old woman left without thanks.\n\nSome days later, Wei encountered her again on the road. She said: *\"I have not forgotten your kindness in resolving my trouble. I am skilled in curing tumors. Here is a small bundle of Yuejinggang mugwort as a token of gratitude. If you encounter someone with a tumor, it can be cured—no more than one cauterization will be needed.\"* Later, Wei met a monk whose tumor hung from his ear; one cauterization healed it instantly. The monk then led him to a wealthy household where a man suffered from a tumor, and one treatment cured him as well. From then on, Wei’s reputation spread, and many sought his aid. In time, he became a rich man, yet he never forgot the old woman, thinking of her day and night.\n\nOne day, Wei encountered another person who told him: *\"That old woman was the daughter of Bao Shuo and the wife of the Perfected Master Ge Hong. She had practiced this moxibustion in Nanhai for many years.*\n\n*Ding Shuying*\nDing Shuying was a woman of unknown origin. She possessed the hidden virtue of aiding the poor and delivered Zhao Fu from mortal peril. Moved by her celestial merit, the August Person bestowed upon her the secret essentials of the *Huangting* and ascended as an immortal. Now a fairy consort of Zhu Ling, she often traverses the Three Clarities and the Bureau of Destiny—such was her virtuous governance.\n\n*Immortal Maiden Huang*\nImmortal Maiden Huang was the younger sister of the Jin-dynasty immortal Huang Renlan. Earlier, the immortal Wu Meng had buried his mother in Xin’gan County of Linjiang Prefecture, where sheer cliffs rose, and a fairy tomb, fairy well, and fairy altar stood. The altar and tomb remain intact to this day, and the place is called Great Tomb Ridge, also known as Wu Ridge. At the time, both Renlan and his sister attended the burial. The Immortal Maiden cherished the landscape and, by Wu’s mother’s tomb, cultivated the Dao and refined elixirs. Later, she ascended in broad daylight, leaving behind a slab of alchemical stone scorched by the fire of the elixir.\"\n\nOver the years, the stone remained unweathered. Whenever water was poured from a pitcher upon it, the stone would grow hot without fire, earning it the name \"Boiling Stone.\" Emperor Zhezong of the Song, struck by its marvel, bestowed the construction of a temple in her honor, first named Immortal Maiden Abbey, later renamed Yellow Immortal’s Efficacious Response Abbey. The Boiling Stone and its spring well endure to this day. In times of drought, disease, or pestilence, prayers offered there are invariably answered.\n\n*Tea Crone of Guangling*\nThe Tea Crone of Guangling’s surname and given name are unknown. Among her village folk, she appeared as a woman of seventy, yet she was nimble and strong, sharp of hearing and sight, her hair still black. After Emperor Yuan of Jin crossed south, elders passed down tales of having seen her for over a hundred years, her countenance unchanged. She would carry a vessel of tea to the market to sell, and though crowds clamored to buy from dawn till dusk, her vessel’s tea remained as freshly steeped as ever, never diminishing. Many marveled at this. When local officials imprisoned her for violating trade laws, the crone took up her tea vessel and flew away through the prison window.\n\n*Lady Luo*\nThe immortal E Lühua of the Southern Mountains was a woman of about twenty, clad in blue. In the third year of the Shengping era of Emperor Mu of Jin, she descended to the home of Yang Quan. She visited six times in a single month, each time presenting Quan with a poem. Its closing lines read: *\"What I await is not the fleeting bloom of morning, but for you.\"* She also bestowed upon him a fire-washed cloth, a handkerchief, a golden belt, and a jade clasp, saying, *\"Guard these words well, and do not speak of them lightly.\"* When inquired, she was said to be Lady Luo Yu, a woman of the Nine Doubts Mountain who had attained the Dao. She gave Quan the medicine for *shijie* (corpse-liberation), and now resides in the mountains of eastern Xiang. This woman has lived for nine hundred years.\n\n*Mother Liang*\nMother Liang was a native of Xu Pan.\n\nMother Liang, widowed and childless, kept an inn at Pingyuan Pavilion. Travelers who came to rest there felt as though they had returned home. When guests repaid her, she never once mentioned the amount. Even those who stayed for months never wearied of her hospitality. Beyond clothing and food, she gave all she earned to the poor and sick. Once, a young man stayed for over a month, his behavior unlike that of ordinary people. As he departed, he said, *\"I am the Little Lad of the Eastern Sea.\"* Mother Liang did not know who the Little Lad was.\n\nIn the fourth year of Yuanhui of Emperor Cangwu of Song (the *bingshen* year), the Daoist Xu Daosheng of Ma’er Mountain was traveling to Mengyin when, west of Fengcheng, he encountered a carriage drawn by a black ram, which halted on its own. A young boy called out, *\"Daoist Xu, come forward.\"* Xu stepped closer, stopping about three paces from the carriage. Above him, he saw two more boys, aged around twelve or thirteen, both dressed in yellow robes with crimson sashes, their hair tied in topknots. Their bearing was so refined that none in the world could compare. A child from the carriage relayed a message: *\"I am Mother Liang of the Pingyuan inn. The Supreme has summoned me back, and I must pass by Penglai to seek Master Wang Qiao, then proceed to Mount Tai for inspection. I wished to see you, and here you are. The divine reins flutter, the dark net spreads its banners, but the post stations are few, and the daily journey spans three thousand *li*. Our meeting draws near, yet my heart is heavy with care. Soon I shall ascend to the Three Clarities, and these three boys will escort me to the Dark Capital. Convey my gratitude to the faithful men and women of the East: the Great Peace is near, and one in ten shall be delivered. Guide them well, for beyond this, there shall be no peril.\"*\n\nShe raised her hand in farewell, saying, *\"Until we meet in the Great Peace.\"* The carriage soared away, vanishing into the distance. When Xu returned to the inn and inquired, it was the very day Mother Liang had transcended the world.\n\n*Immortal Lady Xu*\nImmortal Lady Xu was the daughter of Xu Zhicai, a minister of the Sui dynasty. Though her teacher’s name is unknown, she had already lived for several centuries, her appearance ever that of a woman of twenty-four or twenty-five. Skilled in protective incantations, she wandered alone across the land, visiting the Three Rivers and Five Peaks, Tiantai and Siming, Luofu and Kuocang—all the famous mountains and sacred sites. She often lodged in caves beneath cliffs or among forest grottos, or else stayed in temples. One day, a group of ruffians approached with honeyed words and lewd advances. The Lady rebuked them sharply. Enraged, they drew blades to threaten her, but her demeanor only grew more composed. She laughed and said, *\"I am a woman who has abandoned home and family to wander like clouds and water, unafraid of dragons or tigers. Do you think I fear the likes of you?\"* She then removed her outer robe and extinguished their torch. The men rejoiced, believing they had prevailed.\n\nThe next morning, as the Lady prepared to leave the mountain, the ruffians stood frozen in place, their bodies rigid as if bound, their mouths sealed and unable to speak. Only after she had traveled several *li* did they return to normal. She traveled throughout the Jiangbiao region, and the people of Wu saw her for over forty years, her countenance unchanged. She moved as swiftly as if flying, and wherever she went, people revered her as a deity, none daring to jest or offend with impure intentions. In the early years of Xiantong under Emperor Yizong of Tang, she said to Jia Yuntao, a Daoist of the White Crane Abbey in Zhan County, *\"My late father served in the Zhou and Sui dynasties, renowned for his arts. His hidden merits extended to all things, and now he too has attained the Dao. Thus, I have been blessed with good fortune and longevity as well.\"* From this, it is clear she was indeed the daughter of Xu Zhicai.\n\nHua Gu—Hua Gu was the Daoist nun Huang Lingwei. Though eighty years of age, she retained the appearance of youth, her countenance like that of an infant. Her Daoist practice was lofty and pure, and the world called her Hua Gu. She walked at a leisurely pace in her hempen sandals, yet even galloping horses could not overtake her. Her origins were unknown. From the early Tang, she wandered between Jiang, Zhe, Hu, and the Ling Mountains, visiting every renowned mountain and sacred grotto without exception. Wherever she passed or lodged in the wilds, spirits guarded her. If anyone harbored impure intentions and sought to insult or violate her, they would immediately suffer misfortune. Far and near, people revered and honored her as a deity, serving her as if she were divine.\n\nShe had heard that the Lady Wei of South Mountain had once crossed the river to cultivate the Dao, leaving behind an altar and oratory in Linchuan Prefecture. On the western side of the Ruzhui River, at Stone Well Mountain, there stood a immortals’ altar. She set out to seek it. Over the years, the site had become overgrown with brambles and obscured by thickets, so that none in her time knew of it. In the winter of the second year of Changshou during the reign of Empress Wu Zetian of Tang—the year *renchen*—she traveled to West Mountain in Hongzhou to visit the Daoist Hu Huichao and inquire about it. Hu, styled Basu, was one who could commune with the divine. He pointed her to a place six *li* south of the city walls, called Tortoise Mound, where an ancient stone tortoise stood. Whenever it encroached upon the fields, people would strike its head, and there it had broken—this was the very site. Hua Gu searched and found the altar nearby, still standing clearly in its original place. Beneath it, she uncovered a revered statue, oil jars, a weighing knife, lamp dishes, and other relics. She repaired and restored the site.\n\nLater, in a dream, Lady Wei directed her to a Nine-Bend Pool south of the altar. She sought it out and found it, its broad steps still intact. During the Jingyun era, Emperor Ruizong sent the Daoist Ye Shanxin, bearing embroidered images and incense, to perform rites. A Dongling Abbey was then built west of the altar, and seven Daoist nuns were ordained to reside there. By the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, offerings and prayers continued without cease. Whenever wind and rain arose, the sound of flutes and pipes could be heard.\n\nFor all rites and visits, strict purity was required—otherwise, serpents and tigers would roar in alarm. At times, cloud-like phenomena would appear, resembling crows or trailing grasses, descending directly upon the altar. In an instant, they would vanish to the west, as if toward Jingshan, occurring more than once. Hua Gu, her spirit resonant and attuned, received a secret revelation: \"The ancient border of Jingshan—you must restore it with reverence.\" Soon after, an extraordinary fragrance wafted from the west. Hua Gu, having repeatedly received auspicious signs, personally oversaw the repairs. Passing the night at the cave’s entrance, she heard the sound of chimes, and though the land had long lain desolate, it was as if someone guided her to lodge amid the wilds, where she rested in perfect peace. At dawn, entering the mountain, she indeed found the remnants of the altar hall. There, she erected buildings, and the celestial chants of *buxu* and the hymns of immortals echoed for miles around the altar. Those who came to gather firewood without proper reverence invariably encountered strange and startling phenomena. A wild elephant, pierced by an arrow, came to Hua Gu for aid, and she removed it. Thereafter, before each ritual, the elephant would offer lotus roots to her in tribute.\n\nIn the ninth year of Emperor Xuanzong’s Kaiyuan era, the xin-you year, Hua Gu, sensing her ascension was near, told her disciples: \"My celestial journey hastens—I cannot remain long. After my transformation, do not nail the coffin shut; simply drape it with a crimson gauze veil.\" The next day, she passed without illness. Her skin remained fragrant and pure, her body warm, and an uncommon fragrance filled the hall. Her disciples followed her instructions: the coffin was left unnailed, covered only with crimson gauze. Suddenly, a thunderous crash resounded, and a hole the size of a chicken’s egg appeared in the gauze. Inside the coffin lay only a wooden tablet wrapped in silk. A gap in the roof, large enough for a person to pass through, had formed. Melons placed as offerings sprouted vines within days, bearing two fruits like peaches. Each year on the anniversary of her passing, winds and clouds would surge violently, entering the chamber.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong, astonished upon hearing of this, ordered the event recorded. The next day, he dispatched the Daoist Cai Wei to include it in the *Later Biographies of Immortals*. In the twenty-eighth year of the Kaiyuan era, the geng-chen year, the third month, the yi-you day, the Daoist Zi Longbi arrived to perform rites. Suddenly, a white deer emerged from the east of the altar, approached Hua Gu’s tomb, and vanished—precisely where her wooden tablet was buried. Five-colored immortal maidens then gathered upon the altar. Prefect Zhang Jingyi, moved by such sacred virtue, erected a stele to commemorate the event.\n\nIn the eighth year of the Tianbao era, the ji-chou year, at the site where Lady Wei ascended, two Daoist nuns were ordained to maintain the incense and offerings. In the third year of Emperor Daizong’s Dali era, the wu-shen year, Yan Zhenqing, Duke of Lu Commandery and Prefect of Fuzhou, seeing the old border in ruins and lacking caretakers, summoned the Daoist Huang Daojin and thirteen others from Xianling Abbey to reside at Dongling Abbey. He also appointed seven virtuous Daoist nuns, led by Li Qiongxian, to dwell at the Immortal Altar. Yan composed and personally inscribed the *Stele of the Immortal Altar* to record these events.\n\n**Jiao Jingzhen**\nJiao Jingzhen, a Tang dynasty female immortal, through deep meditation, was guided to Fangzhang Mountain, where she encountered two celestial maidens. They told her: \"If you wish to attain the rank of a true official, you must pay homage to the Azure Lad of the Eastern Flower and receive the Three Sovereigns’ teachings.\" When she asked their names, they replied: \"Sima Chengzhen.\" Returning, she sought ordination from Chengzhen and soon ascended to heaven. She once descended to tell Xue Jichang: \"Your attainment surpasses that of Ren of Taodu Waters; you shall become the Azure Lad of the Eastern Flower, a Perfected One of the Highest Clarity.\"\n\n**Wang Fajin**\nWang Fajin was a native of Linjin County in Jianzhou.\n\nIn his infancy, he was naturally drawn to the Dao. His home stood near an ancient abbey, though no Daoist priests dwelt there; yet in his play, he never treated it with disrespect, and whenever he saw its sacred images, he would clasp his hands in reverence. When he reached his teens, a female priest from Jianzhou passed through the neighboring villages and stopped at his home. His parents, seeing his devotion to the Dao, entrusted him to her care. She transmitted to him the *Zhengyi Yansheng Lu* and gave him the name Fajin. From then on, he devoted himself to tending incense and maintaining fasts, even consuming cypress leaves and abstaining from grains, and at times experienced divine manifestations.\n\nThat year, famine struck the Three Rivers region; grain prices soared, and five or six out of every ten people perished. Many survived by foraging for mountain tubers and wild vines. Suddenly, two Azure Lads descended into his courtyard and proclaimed the decree of the Supreme Emperor: \"As you were born with the bones of an immortal and have devoted yourself to the Dao with unwavering sincerity, we now summon you as an Azure Lad to serve in the Jade Capital.\" Fajin immediately rose with the Azure Lads, soaring through the void until they reached the abode of the Celestial Emperor. The Emperor presented him with a jade cup filled with rosy nectar. After he drank, the Emperor said:\n\n\"Humans are endowed with the great essence of the Three Powers and the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth, making it no easy matter to attain human form and be born in the Central Land. The celestial cycles of the four seasons and the terrestrial flourishing of the Five Phases give rise to the Five Grains and a hundred fruits to nourish humanity. Yet people fail to recognize the nurturing grace of Heaven and Earth, carelessly wasting grain and disdaining hemp and silk. Thus, the farmers who till the soil and the women who spin and weave toil without sustenance, exhaust themselves without warmth, their labor squandered without appreciation. This is surely a transgression before the divine spirits, and Heaven and Earth will not protect them.\n\nRecently, the earthly officials of the mountains and rivers have each submitted memorials, reporting that people despise the Five Grains and fail to honor the roots of clothing and food. I have already commanded the Palace of Mount Taihua to recall the spirits of the Five Grains, causing their crops to fail. The common people suffer hunger as a warning and punishment to correct their ways. Yet the foolish masses remain oblivious. Soon after, I received the decree of the Most High, who, in the Dao’s love for life, declared that the wicked should not be allowed to harm the virtuous. Though Heaven, Earth, and the divine spirits punish them, the ignorant masses do not understand the cause of their transgressions, have no path to repentance, and suffer in vain.\n\nYou shall now serve as an Attendant Lad of the Highest Realm, entering the Celestial Palace. For now, I command you to descend and admonish the people below, urging them to repent their sins, cherish silkworms, honor agriculture, treasure the Five Grains and all fruits, recognize the nurturing power of the Great Dao, and the generative force of the fertile earth. They must revere the true Dao and worship the divine spirits. They must not disdain the use of water and fire, and should practice frugality in clothing and food. If all can observe these clear precepts, Heaven and Earth will cherish them, the divine spirits will protect them, wind and rain will be harmonious, and families and nations will enjoy peace. This will also augment your hidden merit.\"\n\nThe Emperor then commanded an attendant maiden to present him with a robe adorned with *langgan* pearls and bestowed upon him a scroll of the *Lingbao Qingzhai Jiao Xie Tiandi Fa*, instructing him to propagate it in the world. He said: \"Let the people gather in places of purity to perform rites of repentance and thanksgiving. Twice a year, in spring and autumn, they should hold these rites—spring to pray for a bountiful harvest, autumn to give thanks for the power of the Dao. In this way, past transgressions may be erased, and the spirits of the Grain Father and Silkworm Mother will ensure abundance. In the year of the Dragon and Tiger, I shall summon you again.\" The Azure Lads then escorted him home, where three months had already passed.\n\nThe scripture he received is the *Lingbao Qingzhai Gaoxie Tiandi Fa*, a method simple and accessible, much like the *Lingbao Ziran Zhai*. Yet when practiced among the people, its efficacy is immediately evident. If even the mats, utensils, or vessels are treated with slight disrespect or impurity, or if those conducting the rites harbor impure intentions, swift winds and torrential rains will destroy the altar, and thunderbolts will shatter the implements. From then on, the people of the Three Rivers and Liang-Han regions annually observed these rites. Even the simple and the reckless trembled in reverence, holding the method in solemn awe.\n\nWherever locusts, droughts, or floods harmed the crops and injured the farmers, those who led the people in sincere devotion, offering incense and prayers to Heaven day and night, invariably received divine protection. The contrast with the irreverent and faithless was immediately apparent. In the south of the region, it was called the *Qingzhai*; in Shu lands, it was known as the *Tiangong Zhai*—both were of the same principle.\n\nIn the eleventh year of the Tianbao era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the year *renchen* (752), Fajin was borne away by cloud-cranes to ascend to Heaven, fulfilling the prophecy of the Dragon and Tiger year spoken by the divine beings.\n\n**Fei Miaoxing**\nFei Miaoxing was the wife of Sun Tianzhen, a Tang dynasty Celestial Master. In the seventh year of the Tianbao era (748), the Celestial Master petitioned for the establishment of an abbey and the ordination of seven female Daoist priests to conduct rituals there. During the chaos of the Five Dynasties, the abbey fell into ruin. In the early Song dynasty, it was revived, and male Daoist priests were appointed to reside there. Statues of the Celestial Master and Miaoxing were enshrined in the abbey. Today, it is known as *Zhenfu Guan*, located in Fengxin County of Longxing Prefecture.\n\n**Gou Xiangu**\nGou Xiangu, a native of Changsha, entered the Dao and resided on Mount Heng. Though over eighty years old, her complexion remained youthful. For over a decade, she secluded herself at the Immortal Altar of Lady Wei of Nanyue, tending incense in solitude. Tigers and wolves roamed near the altar, and ordinary travelers dared not approach without forming groups and carrying weapons. Yet Xiangu dwelled there in deep seclusion, utterly unafraid.\n\nAfter several years, a blue-black bird resembling a wagtail, with a red crown and long tail, flew to her dwelling. It spoke, saying: \"I am a messenger of the Lady of Nanyue. As you, Madam, have cultivated the Dao with such diligence and solitude in these remote woods, she has sent me to keep you company.\" Another day, it said: \"The Queen Mother of the West, surnamed Wei, is your sacred ancestor. Having heard of your devoted cultivation, she will soon send a perfected official to transmit the Dao to you—though the time has not yet come. You must redouble your efforts in practice.\"\n\nWhenever travelers came to the mountain, the blue-black bird would foretell their names and surnames, and on the appointed day, each prediction proved true. It also said: \"Mount Wangmu in Houshan, Henan, where the Queen Mother cultivated the Dao, is the mountain of your homeland.\" One day, the bird flew to her and said: \"Tonight, violent intruders will come. Do not be afraid.\"\n\nThat evening, more than ten men arrived. The Immortal Altar of Lady Wei was a massive slab of stone, roughly a *zhang* square, resting precariously atop another rock. If one person pushed it, the stone would sway, but with many hands, it stood firm. That night, the men came bearing torches, staves, and blades, intending to harm Xiangu. They entered her chamber, but she was upon the ridge and unseen. As they left, they tried to topple the altar, and with a thunderous crash, the mountain trembled and the valley split—yet the stone remained unmoved. Terrified, they fled in disarray. By dawn, those who had scattered to distant villages were torn apart by tigers, nine in all. Only one, who had not joined in the destruction, escaped the beasts' wrath. The altar stood unharmed, as if untouched.\n\nA year later, the blue-black bird told Xiangu to relocate. She moved to Hunan, and the bird followed, though others never heard its speech. Zheng Tian, Duke Wenzhao and former Grand Councilor of the Tang, had once served as Prefect of Wuzhou and studied under her while he was still a Hanlin Academician. Xiangu said to Duke Wenzhao: \"The realm will soon face great turmoil, and the human world will be unfit for long dwelling. I shall seek seclusion at Mount Jiuyi.\" One day, she departed. Princess Wang.\n\nWang Baoyi, serving as Military Controller for Gao Conghui of Jingnan, had a daughter who abstained from meat and blood from birth. At five, she could recite the *Huangting Jing*. As she grew, she dreamed of crossing waters and ascending mountains, where she beheld palaces of gold and silver—clouds revealed them to be Mount Fangzhang. Dozens of female immortals appeared; one said, \"Magu has chosen you as her sister,\" and taught her several *pipa* melodies. Thereafter, they met every few nights, and in over a year, she mastered over a hundred pieces. The most remarkable was *Single-Finger Shang*, played with but one finger. Later, Magu appeared in a dream, saying, \"I shall soon summon you.\" The next day, clouds, cranes, and celestial music filled the courtyard, and the girl passed away in an instant.\n\n*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao, Scroll Four (concluded)*\n*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao, Later Scroll Five*\n\n**The Jade Maiden of the Radiant Star**\nThe Jade Maiden of the Radiant Star dwelled on Mount Hua, partaking of jade nectar, and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Atop the mountain lies a stone tortoise, spanning several *mu* and rising three *ren* in height. Beside it, stone steps lead to its back, where the Jade Maiden’s shrine stands. Before it lie five stones, called the Jade Maiden’s Hair-Washing Basin. The water within is jade-green and limpid, neither swelling with rain nor diminishing in drought. Within the shrine stands a jade stone horse.\n\n**The Jiang Fei**\nThe two Jiang Fei—origin unknown—roamed the banks of the Jiang and Han rivers. There, Zheng Jiaofu encountered them and was captivated, unaware they were divine beings. He told his servant, \"I wish to ask for their girdle ornaments.\" The servant replied, \"The people here are skilled in speech; if you fail, you may regret it.\" Jiaofu ignored him and descended, saying, \"You two must be weary.\" The women replied, \"You, traveler, are the weary one—what weariness do we know?\" Jiaofu said, \"The orange is a pomelo, which I have placed in a bamboo basket to float down the Han. I follow its course, gathering and eating the water-chestnuts, to show my lack of presumption. I beg for your girdle ornaments.\" The women said, \"The orange is a pomelo, which we have placed in a rush basket to float down the Han. We follow its course, gathering and eating the water-chestnuts.\" Then they untied their ornaments and gave them to Jiaofu, who received them and tucked them into his robe.\n\nHe hurried away for several dozen paces, then checked his robe—nothing was there. Turning back, the two women had vanished without a trace.\n\nA poem says:\n*By the Han there are wandering maidens,*\n*Yet they cannot be sought.*\nThis is what it means.\n\nFrom *The Biographies of Transcendents*.\n\n**The Supreme Mystery Woman**\nThe Supreme Mystery Woman, surnamed Zhuan and named He, lost her father in youth. Someone divined that neither she nor her mother would live long, which grieved her deeply. She often said: \"In this world, a single misstep cannot be undone, and death cannot be reversed. The brevity of life’s span can only be extended through cultivating the Dao.\" Thereupon, she sought out an enlightened master, purified her heart, and pursued the Way.\n\nShe obtained the arts of the Jade Child and practiced them for years, eventually gaining the ability to enter water without getting wet. Even in the depths of winter, clad in a single garment upon the water’s surface, her complexion remained unchanged, and her body stayed warm for days on end. She could also relocate government offices, palaces, cities, and houses to other places—appearing no different to the eye, yet vanishing at a gesture. Any locked doors, chests, or cabinets in her presence would open at her command. With a point of her finger, mountains crumbled and trees snapped, yet when she pointed again, they returned to their original state.\n\nWhen traveling with disciples, no matter which mountain they reached, she would strike a stone with her staff at dusk, and a door would open. Entering, they found chambers furnished with tables and chairs, curtains and bedding, kitchens and storerooms—all provided with food and drink as usual. Though they journeyed thousands of miles, this was always the case. She could make small things suddenly grow large, and large things shrink. At times, she would exhale fire that filled the sky, only to extinguish it with a single breath. She could sit amidst flames without her clothes burning. In an instant, she might transform into an old man, a child, or a carriage and horses, riding in and out at will. Her thirty-six arts were renowned.\n\nShe revived the dead and saved countless lives. No one knew what she consumed, nor could anyone obtain her arts. Her complexion grew ever more youthful, her hair as dark as a crow’s. Later, she ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\n**The Maiden of West River**\nThe Maiden of West River was the niece of the transcendent Boshanfu. Boshanfu, a native of Yongzhou, entered Mount Hua to study the Dao, refining his thoughts and ingesting elixirs. From time to time, he returned to his hometown to visit his family. Over two hundred years passed, yet his appearance grew only younger.\n\nWhen he entered a household, he could perceive all the good and evil deeds, merits and transgressions of its ancestors, as if he had witnessed them himself.\n\nThe Maiden could also foretell future fortune and misfortune, and all her words proved true. Seeing her niece aged and afflicted with illness, Boshanfu gave her medicine. When the girl took the remedy, she was already seventy years old, yet gradually she grew younger, her complexion like peach blossoms. Later, a Han envoy passing through West River witnessed a woman at the eastern edge of the city flogging an old man with white hair, who knelt to receive the blows. The envoy found this strange and asked why. The woman replied, \"This is my son. Long ago, my uncle Boshanfu attained the Dao of immortals and secluded himself on Mount Hua. Taking pity on my many ailments, he gave me divine medicine, and I slowly regained my youthful appearance. But this son of mine refused to take the remedy, and so has grown decrepit, unable to keep pace with me. I am vexed by this, and thus I punish him with the rod.\" The envoy asked the ages of the woman and her son. She answered, \"I am one hundred and ten years old, and my son is seventy.\" Soon after, the woman entered Mount Hua.\n\n**The Wife of Yuan Ke**\nThe wife of Yuan Ke was a divine maiden. Yuan Ke was a man of Jiyin County, handsome in appearance, and though many in the village wished to marry their daughters to him, he never took a wife. He often gathered five-colored fragrant herbs, accumulating them for decades, consuming their fruits. One day, five-colored moths alighted upon the herbs. Yuan Ke collected them and placed them among mulberry leaves to cultivate silkworms. When the time for silkworms came, a woman arrived at night, calling herself Yuan Ke’s wife. She explained the state of the silkworms and helped him raise them, feeding them with fragrant herbs. Together, they harvested one hundred and twenty cocoons, each as large as an urn. Unwinding a single cocoon took sixty days. When the task was complete, they both departed, and no one knew where they had gone. Thus, the people of Jiyin established a shrine to the silkworm, building a temple in her honor. Some say she was from the Jiyang family of Chenliu.\n\n**The Wife of Cheng Wei**\nThe wife of Cheng Wei, an Expectant Appointee of the Han, was one who had attained the Dao. She possessed divine transformations, though Cheng Wei did not hold her in great esteem. Once, when he was to accompany the imperial procession, he lacked the proper attire and was deeply troubled. His wife said, \"It is only the lack of clothing that worries you so?\" She then produced two bolts of fine silk, which suddenly appeared. Cheng Wei was fond of alchemical arts but had long failed in his attempts. His wife took a small amount of medicine from her pouch, placed mercury in a vessel, added the medicine, and heated it. In an instant, it turned to silver. When Cheng Wei sought the method from her, she refused, saying his bones were not yet fit to receive it. Pressed beyond endurance, his wife suddenly transformed, her body dissolving as she departed.\n\n**Zhang Jiangzi**\nZhang Jiangzi was the younger sister of Zhang Ji of Western Shu. Having attained the Dao, she now resides in the eastern chamber of the Hall of Easy Transition. From *Declarations of the Perfected*. The note states: Ji was a native of Western Liangzhou during the late Han.\n\nZhang was a general under Dong Zhuo. Later, during the assault on Xiangcheng, he was killed by an arrow—this was the transformation of Zhang Xiu’s uncle. His sister’s name does not appear in external records, nor is it known whether she was married.\n\n**Li Huigu**\nLi Huigu was the wife of Xiahou Xuan of Qi. Having attained the Dao, she now resides in the eastern chamber of the Hall of Easy Transition. From *Declarations of the Perfected*. The note states: Xuan was a man of the late Wei, executed alongside Li Feng by the Prince Wen of Jin. It is unknown whether his wife passed before or after him. Li Feng was from Fengyi, not Qi—it is unclear whose daughter this Li was.\n\n**Shi Shunü**\nShi Shunü was the daughter of Shi Ji of Shanyang. Having attained the Dao, she resides in the eastern chamber of the Hall of Easy Transition. Shi Ji was a native of Wuxing and served as General of the Swift Cavalry under Sun Hao, defending Xiling. The present record calls her of Shanyang, perhaps because she married and took her husband’s commandery, or else there is a discrepancy.\n\n**Zheng Tiansheng**\nZheng Tiansheng was the mother of Deng Zhi. Having attained the Dao, she resides in the eastern chamber of the Hall of Easy Transition. Deng Zhi, styled Boming, was a native of Xinye in Nanyang. In Shu, he served as General of the Chariots and Cavalry under Liu Shan. Later, while traveling, he saw a slow-moving woman carrying a child and, drawing his bow, shot and killed her. Stricken with remorse, he died. It is unknown whose daughter this Zheng was.\n\n**Wen Nüzhen**\n\nAt the rear of the Azure Mist Abbey on Mount Lu stands a rock called Yellow Dragon, said to be where Wen Nüzhen mounted a yellow dragon to ascend to heaven, hence its name. There is also Wen Nüzhen’s Ascension Terrace. Her generation, name, and deeds remain obscure; some say her name was Huìtōng and that she was a Jin-dynasty figure.\n\n**Pei Yuánjìng**\nPei Yuánjìng, whose Daoist name was Yuánjìng, was the daughter of Pei Shēng, magistrate of Weishi County, and the wife of Lǐ Yán, commandant of E County. From childhood\n\nHer father taught students to support the family. Yet from the age of ten, Qi Xiāoyáo was of a serene and indifferent disposition, eschewing childish play and harboring a heart inclined toward the Dao. Her parents, aware of this, often performed hidden acts of virtue for others. When her father sought to instruct her in womanly duties, Xiāoyáo perused the texts and said, “These are but the affairs of ordinary folk.” She then took up the *Scriptures of the Divine Laozi*, reciting them without cease. When she reached marriageable age, matchmakers came to her home, but upon hearing of her ways, deemed it inauspicious. By twenty, her parents betrothed her to a family in the same village who tilled and wove for a living.\n\nHer in-laws were harsh and severe, demanding she tend to silkworms and farming without idleness. Yet Xiāoyáo devoted herself to purity and fasting from dawn to dusk, paying no heed to household affairs. Her husband, Jì Xún, reproached her repeatedly. Xiāoyáo addressed her in-laws, requesting to return home, and her parents, too, compelled her to go back. Thereupon, declaring her inability to attend to worldly matters, she wished to dwell alone in a quiet chamber to cultivate the Dao and thus provide for her in-laws. Jì Xún and her parents, both harboring suspicions, confined her to a room.\n\nXiāoyáo sustained herself only with fragrant water, fasting and meditating in stillness. She sang:\n*“Laughing to see the sea turn to dust,*\n*Parting from the immortals before the Queen Mother’s flowers.*\n*A thousand years hence, I return to the heavens above,*\n*With a heart that cherishes the people of this world.”*\n\nJì Xún’s family and the neighbors all deemed her mad. At night, voices were heard from her chamber, yet by dawn, she was seen sitting alone—none were alarmed. Three days later, at daybreak, the household heard a thunderous crack from the room. They saw only her garments and shoes left inside. Gazing upward, they beheld clouds and mist ablaze with radiance, phoenixes and cranes soaring and calling. Celestial music and fragrant breezes filled the air, while a procession of colorful banners unfurled. Xiāoyáo and the immortals appeared amidst the clouds, their voices distinct as they spoke their farewells.\n\nJì Xún hastened to inform Xiāoyáo’s parents. By the time they arrived, the vision remained. The townsfolk all rushed to witness it, and none failed to marvel in awe.\n\n**He the Immortal Maiden**\n\nHe the Immortal Maiden was the daughter of He Tai of Zengcheng County, Guangzhou. During the reign of Empress Wu Zetian of the Tang, she dwelt by Yunmu Creek. At fourteen or fifteen, she dreamed one night that a divine being instructed her to consume yunmu powder, which would grant her a light body and immortality. She partook of it and vowed never to marry. Often she roamed the mountaintops, her movements swift as flight. Each morning she would depart, returning at dusk with mountain fruits for her mother. Later, she ceased eating grain, and her speech grew strange. The Empress dispatched envoys to summon her to court, but she vanished en route.\n\nThe *Record of the Meeting Immortals Abbey in Guangzhou* states: He the Immortal Maiden resided there, consuming yunmu powder, and ascended to immortality in broad daylight during the Jinglong era of Emperor Zhongzong. By the ninth year of the Tianbao era under Emperor Xuanzong, during a communal feast at Duxu Abbey, five-colored clouds arose above the Altar of Ma Gu, witnessed by all. An immortal maiden emerged in ethereal form, and the Daoist Cai Tianyi recognized her as He the Immortal Maiden. During the Dali era of Emperor Daizong, she reappeared at Small Stone Tower, and the prefect of Guangzhou, Gao Yun, reported the matter to the court.\n\n---\n\n**Xie Ziran**\n\nXie Ziran, a female perfected one from Huayang in Shu, was gifted by nature and entered the Dao in her youth. Her master presented her with the *Scriptures of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi*, which she read once as if revisiting an old text, and twice to commit it to memory. As she matured, her spirit and qi grew pure and luminous, her words and bearing surpassing the ordinary. She loved the qin and books, excelled in calligraphy, and composed literature. She disdained the conduct of Zhuo Wenjun. Often she burned incense and prayed to the Queen Mother of the West and Ma Gu, admiring the integrity of Lady Wei of South Mountain.\n\nAt forty, she set out on distant travels, visiting Qingcheng, Damei, Emei, the Thirty-Six Quiet Abodes, and the Twenty-Four Grotto-Heavens. Leaving Shu, she journeyed through the capital and Luoyang, reaching the Jiang and Huai regions. Wherever there were renowned mountains, grotto-heavens, or sacred sites, she spared no effort to explore them. Later, hearing that the Daoist Sima Chengzhen of Tiantai resided on Jade Cloud Peak, a man of lofty virtue, she sought him out. For three years, she served as his disciple, dwelling apart in the mountains, gathering firewood daily for him before returning. She also brought incense and fruit, earnestly seeking instruction.\n\nChengzhen marveled at her perseverance, saying, “I possess no virtue or power—how can I bear this? Yet what do you seek?” Ziran replied, “From a thousand miles away, I came to your door to attain the Way of transcending the world. I seek only the transmission of the highest teachings to achieve liberation—nothing more.” Chengzhen, considering that the highest methods were rarely passed to female perfected ones, feared profaning the great Dao and merely assented.\n\nAfter more than a year, Ziran sighed, “If no enlightened master accepts me, is this not my fate?” Each time she ascended Jade Cloud Peak, she beheld Penglai across the sea, seemingly not far, yet among mortals, she feared no master could be found. Thus, she bid Chengzhen farewell, declaring her intent to journey to Penglai. She sold all her belongings, donned plain robes, and ceased eating grain. Taking only a mat, she cast herself into the sea and drifted upon the waves. A Silla ship spotted her and took her aboard.\n\nAfter several days at sea, she saw only azure waters. At sunset, distant waves surged, and phosphorescent fires stretched to the horizon, the ship sailing through flames. A year later, the wind carried the vessel into waters black as ink, then white as powder, then shimmering like pearls, and finally yellow as sulfur. Suddenly, the wind shifted, and the ship was cast into a bay. There stood a mountain, its sunlight golden, with fragrant grasses, mist, beasts, and birds—all of a yellow hue. The crew disembarked and climbed the mountain, finding it composed entirely of sulfur. The merchants hastily discarded their other goods and loaded the ship with the stones.\n\nAfter passing through the four colored waters, each taking three to five days and nights, the wind and sails carried them without measure of distance. A month later, another crosswind arose, and the sailors grew anxious, fearing for their lives. Suddenly, a great mountain surged from the sea, its summit lined with over a thousand red banners. The helmsman declared it the dorsal fin of a whale. Then, under clear skies, a column of vapor rose over a hundred *zhang* high, accompanied by a tempest—this was the whale’s breath.\n\nAmidst such sights—sea people, monstrous beasts, and spirits in myriad forms—Ziran burned incense, praying to Penglai. In an instant, they reached a mountain where forests, flowers, and birds thrived in misty springtime. The helmsman climbed ashore and saw many houses and people. Ziran asked, “Is this not an immortal mountain?” The helmsman replied, “Those aboard may disembark to rest until the wind favors us.”\n\nSoon, all climbed the mountain and scattered, but Ziran wandered alone. Several Daoists appeared, their attendants in blue robes, the wind through the trees chiming like metal and stone. The fragrance of flowers and herbs permeated her to the bone. Azure luan birds, frost cranes, green parrots, and five-colored dogs roamed the courtyards. Among them stood one adorned in a floral crown and rosy robes, their countenance refined and beautiful. A blue-robed attendant led Ziran to them.\n\n“I seek a master in Penglai to transmit the Way of liberation,” she said. The Daoist smiled, “Penglai lies beyond the Weak Waters, three hundred thousand *li* away. No ship can reach it, nor can any but flying immortals arrive. Sima Chengzhen of Tiantai Mountain, whose name is inscribed on the Cinnabar Terrace and who dwells in the Red City, is a true and worthy master. You should return to him.”\n\nMoments later, the wind rose, and the helmsman urged all to board, declaring the wind favorable. As they set sail, another crosswind carried them for three days before they reached the shores of Taizhou. Overjoyed, Ziran returned to Tiantai and recounted all to Chengzhen, apologizing for her past transgressions. Chengzhen said, “Wait until an auspicious day, when I shall ascend the altar to transmit the teachings.”\n\nThus, he bestowed upon her the methods of the Highest Clarity. Later, she returned to Shu and completed her cultivation on Golden Spring Mountain in Nanchong County, Guozhou. On the sixteenth day of the tenth month in the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era of Emperor Dezong (794), Lord Lao commanded her summons, and she ascended to immortality in broad daylight.\n\nThe Military Commissioner Wei Gao memorialized the event to the imperial court.\n\nAnother account states that when Xie Ziran was about to ascend to heaven, she wrote on the eastern wall of her hall: “I leave this message to all my kin: do not grieve or suffer. Instead, diligently cultivate virtue and power, establish fields of blessings, maintain purity, and recite the Dao. After a hundred kalpas, may we meet again in the realm of the Pure Source.”\n\nHer writing remains preserved to this day. Three days after her ascension, she descended from heaven once more and spoke to Prefect Li Jian, saying, “In the heavens stands the loftiest Jade Hall, where Lord Lao resides. Its walls are of white jade, inscribed above with the names of immortals in gold. At times, vermilion script appears beneath, noting those who descend to become emperors or chief ministers. Whenever immortals pay homage to Lord Lao, they bow four times. Fearing that mortals would not believe in the existence of immortals, I have come briefly to tell you this.” Having spoken, she ascended to heaven again. Li Jian reported the matter in a memorial, and an imperial edict was issued in praise.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Eastern Extremity, Bai Ziqing, declared: “Xie Ziran is now the Perfected One of the Eastern Extremity.”\n\nAs for the Lady Wang—she was the wife of Xie Liangbi, a Drafter in the Imperial Secretariat. A descendant of Wang Xizhi, the Right General of the Eastern Jin, she hailed from Kuaiji. Liangbi, having passed the imperial examinations, served as an Attendant in the Eastern Zhe Circuit before marrying her. A year later, Liangbi was summoned to the capital at Chang’an, where he rose through the ranks to become Drafter in the Imperial Secretariat.\n\nFrom childhood, Lady Wang was devoted to the Dao and often recited the *Scripture of the Yellow Court*. While Liangbi was away, she fell gravely ill, and her condition only worsened. At that time, the Celestial Master Wu Jun was traveling through Siming, Tiantai, Lanting, and the Grotto of Yu, halting his staff in Shanyin. Lady Wang’s family sought his aid, and through his methods—drinking consecrated water and swallowing talismans—she recovered after two nights.\n\nGrateful for the saving power of the Dao, she sought initiation from the Celestial Master. She cultivated with diligence, burning incense in seclusion, her mind fixed on stillness, her aspirations set on ascension. She ceased taking grain, swallowing qi instead, and her spirit harmonized as her body grew light. At times, rare fragrances and auspicious clouds would gather above her residence. Immortals descended in secret, their hairpins scattering, and she communed with the divine, though none knew it.\n\nOne day, she suddenly said to her maidservant, “The illness I suffered for nearly a decade was cured by the Celestial Master, who prolonged my exhausted fate. Yet my awakening to the Dao came late, and my cultivation remains imperfect. My past transgressions weigh upon me, and my repentance is incomplete. All my life, I harbored worldly resentments, my heart closed and dark, obstructing the Dao. I must now refine my form in the hidden light and purify my heart to transform my inner nature. Only after twenty years will I shed this mortal coil.”\n\nWhen she died that evening, her family followed her instructions: they used no coffin but fashioned a wooden canopy, placing her body in the wilderness and appointing someone to check on it periodically. All was done with simplicity. Laid in the garden, she appeared as if merely asleep, her form unchanged.\n\nTwenty years later, thieves broke into the burial site, and her body fell to the ground. In the depths of winter, a thunderous crash suddenly resounded beside the canopy. Her family rushed to investigate and, lifting her body, found it light as an empty husk, yet with skin, flesh, nails, and hair all intact. On her right side was a fissure over a foot long. They gathered her remains once more.\n\nThe Lady of Southern Marchmount once said: Those who attain the Dao in the highest degree ascend to heaven in broad daylight, their form and bones both taking flight, where they replenish the ranks of the Perfected Officials. Those of the next rank shed their mortal coils like serpents or cicadas, their forms and bones likewise ascending, their flesh and substance ascending to heaven—all become immortals and dwell upon the sacred mountains.\n\nLiang Bi also observed the rites of a disciple, personally attending the Heavenly Master. He then established a tradition with the Heavenly Master, recording these matters in detail.\n\nCai Xunzhen\nCai Xunzhen was the daughter of Vice Minister Cai. Li Tengkong was the daughter of Chancellor Li Linfu. Both women displayed extraordinary qualities from a young age, growing up in wealth and nobility yet devoid of worldly desires. Each wished to leave home and study the Dao, and their parents could not dissuade them.\n\nDuring the Zhenyuan era of Emperor Dezong of Tang, they became companions and entered Mount Lu. Xunzhen resided in the Yongzhen Grotto-Heaven at the southern slope of the Five Old Peaks behind the Screenfold Range, while Tengkong dwelt at the northern base of Lingyun Peak, also behind the Screenfold Range. There, great streams surged and foamed, white clouds drifted past verdant cliffs, and the scenery was sublime. Both women cultivated virtue and could heal the suffering of others with elixirs and talismans, earning the gratitude of people near and far. Every year, during the Three Primes and Eight Festivals, they would gather at Yongzhen Grotto to serve as teacher and disciple, discoursing on the Dao.\n\nXu Hun, the prefect of Jiujiang, once reported their deeds to the court, and Emperor Dezong held them in great esteem. When they shed their mortal forms, their disciples gathered their hairpins and established shrines in their former residences. The local people offered sacrifices to them seasonally. Later, when Xu Hun entered the court, he spoke of the two women’s former dwellings during the mourning period for Empress Zhaode, suggesting they be granted temple names to honor their memory. An imperial edict was thus issued, designating Yongzhen Grotto as Xunzhen Abbey and Tengkong’s residence as Zhaode Abbey.\n\nLi Bai’s poem *Seeing Off Li Yun* reads:\n*I envy you, daughter of a noble house,*\n*Who loves the Dao and cherishes the immortals.*\n*With pale hands you scoop autumn mists,*\n*Your gauze robes trailing in purple haze.*\n*Once you depart beyond the Screenfold Range,*\n*You’ll ride a simurgh, wielding a jade whip.*\n\nMa Ao\nIn his youth, Lu Qi lodged in a ruined estate with an old woman named Ma Ao.\n\nOne day, Lu Qi saw a fully laden ox-cart outside Ma Ao’s door. Peering inside, he beheld a girl of fourteen or fifteen, radiant as an immortal. The next day, he inquired after her, and Ma Ao asked, “Would you like to meet her?” Lu Qi assented. Ma Ao replied, “Very well.” Three days later, he saw resplendent towers and carriages descending from the sky—it was the same girl. She said to Lu Qi, “Come again in seven days.” She then called Ma Ao and handed her two medicinal pellets, instructing her to plant them in the ground. In an instant, two gourds sprouted, growing swiftly to the size of jars. Ma Ao split them open with a blade, and she and Lu Qi each entered one. Suddenly, wind and clouds arose, lifting them into the azure heavens.\n\nLu Qi asked Ma Ao, “How far is it from here to Luoyang?” She replied, “Eighty thousand *li*.” After some time, palaces appeared atop the gourd, their walls of crystal. The girl resided in the central hall, surrounded by hundreds of attendants, while Ma Ao stood among the guards below. The girl bade Lu Qi sit and served him wine and food, saying, “Sir, you may choose one of three fates: first, remain here as an official, with a lifespan equal to heaven’s; second, become an earthbound immortal, free to visit this place at will; or third, return to the human realm as a chancellor.” Lu Qi replied, “To stay here is my greatest wish.” The girl rejoiced, saying, “This is the Crystal Palace. I am the Lady of Grand Yin, and my immortal rank is already exalted. If you dwell here, you shall ascend in broad daylight.” She then drafted a memorial to the Celestial Emperor.\n\nSoon after, a crimson-robed messenger proclaimed the Emperor’s decree: “Does Lu Qi wish to reside in the Crystal Palace? To become an earthbound immortal? Or to return as a chancellor in the human realm?” Lu Qi answered, “I choose to be a chancellor in the human realm.” The crimson-robed messenger hurried him out, and the Lady of Grand Yin paled in dismay. She ordered Ma Ao to swiftly escort him back, pushing him into the gourd. When they returned to his former dwelling, his dust-covered bed remained as before, while the gourd and Ma Ao vanished without a trace. Thus did the immortal Ma Ao reveal divine transformations to enlighten mortals, yet Lu Qi, blinded by greed and folly, fell from grace.\n\nLu Meiniang\nDuring the reign of Emperor Shunzong of Tang, the southern seas presented Lu Meiniang as tribute. She claimed descent from the Northern Patriarch, the Emperor’s Teacher, though her family had drifted to the southern frontier after the Dazhong era. From childhood, she was keenly perceptive and unmatched in skill. She could embroider the *Lotus Sutra* upon a foot-long silk ribbon, each character no larger than a grain of millet.\n\nShe also crafted a *Flying Immortal Canopy*, weaving a single strand of silk into five layers, within which lay the Ten Continents and Three Isles. Each day, she consumed no more than two or three *ge* of sesame rice. Emperor Xianzong, admiring her intelligence and extraordinary skill, bestowed upon her a golden phoenix bracelet to adorn her wrist. Knowing that Meiniang did not wish to remain in the palace, he ordained her as a Daoist nun, allowing her to return to the Southern Seas, and granted her the title *Master of Carefree Wandering*. Later, when her spirit departed, the room filled with fragrance. As her disciples prepared for burial, they found the coffin strangely light; upon removing its lid, only a pair of lotus slippers remained.\n\nThereafter, some claimed to have seen Meiniang riding purple clouds over the sea. At the time, the recluse Li Xiangxian of Luofu composed *The Tale of Lu the Carefree*.\n\nWu Cailuan\nIn the final years of Emperor Wenzong’s Taihe era, a scholar named Wen Xiao, a wanderer with no home, drifted like duckweed to Zhongling Prefecture. Xiao was refined in temperament and devoted to the Dao, his appearance pure and transcendent. He befriended the Daoist priest Liu Qiqian of the Purple Ultimate Palace and resided there for three or four years.\n\nWest of Zhongling lay the *Wandering Canopy Abbey*, the former abode of the Perfected Lord Xu, who had ascended to immortality. Each year on the anniversary of his ascension, people from Wu, Shu, Chu, and Yue traveled thousands of *li* to gather there, bearing rare incense, precious fruits, silk brocades, and gold coins, offering vegetarian feasts and rituals to pray for blessings. The crowds at Zhongling numbered in the tens of thousands, with carriages and horses clamoring, men and women thronging shoulder to shoulder, dancing and singing in linked arms.\n\nXiao went to observe the festivities and noticed a young woman whose singing stood apart. Her lyrics were refined and otherworldly, harmonizing with realms beyond the mortal. When he heard a verse containing the words *Wen Xiao* and *Cailuan*, he startled: *\"Is this an omen of my name? She must be a companion of the immortals.\"* He stood rooted, unable to leave. Inquiring among the bystanders, some said: *\"She is a servant girl from Hongjing, living near Hongya Altar. But no one knows her true origins.\"*\n\nBy the time her song ended, it was already the fourth watch. The young woman bade farewell to her companions and, holding a candle, traversed a path through towering pines, climbing the mountain by touch, braving perilous heights. Xiao secretly followed her trail. As her candle neared its end, several immortal youths emerged bearing pine torches to welcome her. Xiao gasped, and the young woman turned, questioning: *\"Are you not Wen Xiao?\"* He replied: *\"Yes.\"* She said: *\"Our fated numbers do not align—why have you come here?\"* Leading him to the summit, she was met with strict attendants, a table draped in silk, a golden censer burning foreign incense. After they sat, two immortal maidens approached with ledgers, their inquiries mostly concerning the drowning of travelers in rivers and lakes.\n\nWhen a woman’s name appeared, the young woman seemed displeased. Another entry mentioned a storm on Cang Lake that had accidentally claimed the lives of children. She grew angry: *\"How could such a mistake be made?\"* Holding the register, she said: *\"The infants’ qi was too weak—they could not endure it. We did not fail to save them; there was simply nothing to be done.\"* Xiao, hearing this, pressed her for details, but she refused to answer. When he insisted, she replied: *\"These are secrets of the unseen realm, not meant for your ears. If I reveal them, we will both suffer calamity.\"*\n\nThe immortal maidens departed with the ledgers, and suddenly the sky darkened, wind and thunder raged, tearing the curtains and overturning the table. Xiao, terrified, dared not look. The young woman hastily dressed, took up a ritual tablet, and knelt in reverence, awaiting punishment. Soon, the storm subsided, the stars reappeared, and an immortal youth descended from the heavens, holding a celestial decree: *\"Wu Cailuan, for yielding to personal desire and divulging heavenly secrets, is demoted to the mortal realm as a wife for twelve years.\"* She wept, then descended the mountain with Xiao. They married and returned to Zhongling, settling in Xiao’s former dwelling.\n\nOnly then did Xiao learn her name. When he asked about her lineage, she said: *\"My father was the Immortal Lord Wu, named Meng, from Yuzhang. His deeds are recorded in the *Book of Jin*. He aided people and rectified the Dao, and now serves as an immortal official, his name inscribed in the grotto heavens. I have managed the registers of the unseen for six hundred years, but for some unknown offense, I was suddenly demoted. Yet through me, you too may transcend this world.\"*\n\nXiao lived in poverty, unable to support himself. Cailuan transcribed the *Book of Sun Simiao* daily, her brush moving like the wind. Each completed copy sold for five *jin* of gold; when the money was spent, she would transcribe another. For nearly a decade, few knew of this, until the second year of Emperor Wuzong’s Huichang era. Then, she and Xiao secretly moved to Xinwu County, beside Mount Yuewang in the village of Zou Ju. There, they taught dozens of children.\n\nOne night, two tigers roared outside their courtyard. At dawn, the couple had vanished. At daybreak, a woodcutter descending Mount Yuewang saw them each riding a tiger, moving as swiftly as the wind, vanishing among the peaks.\n\nDu Lanxiang\nA fisherman on the Xiang River found a three-year-old girl on the shores of Dongting Lake and, taking pity on her, raised her for over a decade. Her appearance was extraordinary, her bearing uncommon. Suddenly, a celestial youth descended from the sky and carried her away. Before leaving, she told her foster father: *\"I am the immortal Du Lanxiang. I cannot return home now, but later I will descend to the household of Zhang Shuo at Dongting.\"*\n\nZhang was a cultivator of the Dao. When Lanxiang first descended, she bestowed upon him a jade tablet, a jade spittoon, and a red cloth for ritual purification, as tokens of his ascent to immortality. One evening, she ordered her attendants to present Zhang with a robe woven from yellow *lin* feathers, saying: *\"This is the raiment of the highest immortals.\"*\n\nThe Zhuge Clan\nOn Mount Jiuhua, the wife of a woodcutter, née Zhuge, fell ill several times. One day, she told her parents-in-law: *\"My illness will not only be cured—I will also attain immortality.\"* Soon after, she walked out the door and ascended into the sky.\n\nA few days later, she descended again, saying: *\"In the celestial palaces above, the towers and pavilions are all carved from green jade, their windows adorned. The curtains and drapes are strung with pearls and gems, woven with threads of dragon silk, their five hues shimmering in radiance. As immortal maidens walk through their luminous midst, the fragrance of deathless incense lingers. I have come but briefly to see you.\"* Soon after, a five-colored chariot arrived, drawn by twin dragons and driven by mighty immortals, with jade maidens in attendance. The woman mounted it and drifted slowly away.\n\n**The Weaver Girl**\nZheng Delin of Changsha was traveling to Jiangxia to visit his parents. On his return journey, he lodged at Dongting Lake alongside a merchant named Wei. A young woman of the Wei household was fishing from a waterside pavilion. Delin inscribed a poem on a strip of red silk and cast it to her:\n\n*\"Slender hands dangle the hook by the water’s pane,\nCrimson reflections vie with autumn’s Yangtze glow.\nSince you unclasped your girdle for Jiao Fu of old,\nMight I beg a pair of luminous pearls as well?\"*\n\nThe girl, charmed by the red silk, reeled it in. At dawn, Delin hoisted his sails and departed with the wind. As dusk fell, a fisherman reported: *\"A merchant’s great vessel has sunk in Dongting.\"* Grief-stricken, Delin composed an elegy for his *\"River Sister\"*:\n\n*\"Soft winds stir the autumn reeds on Dongting’s tide,\nA drowned maiden’s sorrow swirls in rippling waves.\nHave you not seen the white duckweed’s tears?\nBeneath the moon, the river’s gentle gulls take flight.\"*\n\nHe poured libations into the water and cast the poem after them. The river god conveyed it to the water palace, where the Lord of the Waters declared: *\"Delin shall one day be a wise magistrate of our domain.\"* He summoned his steward to deliver the Wei girl to Zheng. When she beheld the palace lord, she saw only an old man.\n\nThat night, Delin felt something strike his boat. He hauled it aboard—it was the Wei girl. He took her as his wife. Years later, he indeed became magistrate of Baling. Upon arriving at Dongting, an old man appeared and said: *\"Long ago, the water palace spared your life.\"* The Wei girl bowed and asked: *\"My parents dwell in the water palace—may I visit them?\"* *\"You may,\"* he replied.\n\nIn an instant, the boat sank, yet they felt no discomfort. Their parents’ dwelling was no different from an ordinary home, and all the objects lost in the drowning had gathered there. The only difference was the absence of fire; their food consisted solely of water caltrop shoots. Soon, the boat resurfaced at the lake’s edge.\n\n**Yang Baozong**\n\nThe Daoist nun Yang Baozong was of unknown origin. From childhood, she was bright and refined, and when she came of age, she was betrothed. Suddenly, she experienced a profound awakening and begged to become a Daoist. Her parents consented. She entered Mount Lu, dwelling at Chongshan Abbey atop Xiaoxiao Peak. There, she utterly forgot worldly concerns and attained the source of purity and stillness. She practiced grain avoidance and bodily refinement with diligence, and her teachings spread far and wide, greatly reviving the mystic Dao.\n\nEmperor Yuanzong of Southern Tang, having heard of her, summoned her to court with an imperial edict and received her in the palace, arranging for the consorts and concubines who delighted in the Dao to meet her. When asked what she desired, Baozong spoke of the abbey’s dilapidated halls, unable to accommodate the many disciples. The emperor then commanded that gold and coin be bestowed upon her, while the six palaces vied to offer gifts—pearl-embroidered robes and fine silks—amounting to over ten million in value. He ordered the abbey’s halls to be renovated, and had Han Xizai, a gentleman of the Ministry of Rites, compose an inscription. The abbey was granted the name *Zhenfeng* (\"True Dao\"), and Baozong herself was bestowed with purple robes.\n\nThe emperor further commanded his ministers to compose poems in her honor as she departed, all to honor the Dao. Baozong had long admired the character of Cai Xunzhen and Li Tengkong, and like them, she used elixirs, talismans, and scriptures to relieve the suffering of others. In her leisure, she would travel north and south of the folding screens, paying homage at the two shrines.\n\nThough Baozong grew old in years, her complexion remained like that of a child. After her death, her countenance appeared as in life, and her coffin was remarkably light—people believed she had undergone *shijie* (liberation from the corpse). Previously, Chongshan Abbey had been founded in the early Datong era of Emperor Wu of Liang, and for four hundred years thereafter, no eminent figures or lofty scholars had been heard of there. Only with Baozong’s far-reaching reputation did disciples gather in great numbers, and the Daoist community flourished. (Author unknown)\n\nLi Ding’s Account:\n\nDuring the Xuanhe era of Emperor Huizong of the Song, scholars of the Imperial Academy gathered for a drinking session at the Ren family tavern. Suddenly, a woman appeared, her attire strikingly archaic and her garments worn and tattered. Her skin was as white as snow, and she lacked a left arm. Holding a clapper, she sang to the tune of *Iron Horse*:\n\n*\"The balustrade winds, red blooms sway,\nSilken curtains, tender blossoms—\nToo delicate for slender fingers to pluck.\nSwept away by the wind, the heart still startles.\nBrows knit in resentment, mountains darken,\nStriking iron clappers, idly humming the* bu xu *chant.\nIn this dusty world, none know this song—\nYet I ride a yellow crane to the Jasper Capital,\nWhere wind chimes and moonlight gleam pure.\"*\n\nThe scholars found her lyrics strange and asked, \"What is this song?\"\nShe replied, \"It is the *Fajia Daoyin* of the Shangqing Lady Cai. I was a woman of the Tang, but during the chaos of the Five Dynasties, my left hand was severed by bandits. Now I wander among mortals. Since you gentlemen are drinking, I humbly ask for a cup.\"\n\nThey gave her a cup, and after drinking, she departed. The scholars saw her to the door, but she vanished without a trace. (Source: *Zizhi Tongjian*)\n\nEurang Xu’s commentary states: I once heard that during the Five Dynasties, there was a man named Wang Ning, whose family resided in the region between Qing and Qi. He served as Assistant Magistrate in Haozhou and died of illness while in office. Wang Ning’s family had long been poor, and his only son was still young. His wife, Lady Li, carried their child in her arms and bore his remains on her back to return home. Traveling eastward, they passed through Kaifeng and stopped at an inn, but the innkeeper refused them lodging. As Lady Li looked up at the darkening sky, she refused to leave. The innkeeper seized her arm and dragged her out. Raising her face to heaven, she wailed, “I am but a woman—unable to preserve my chastity, yet must this hand be grasped by another?” She then took up an axe and severed her own arm. All who witnessed this wept in sorrow. The Prefect of Kaifeng, upon hearing of the incident, reported it to the court. The court generously provided for Lady Li and flogged the innkeeper.\n\nI have perused Daoist scriptures and found that from ancient times, those of utmost loyalty, filial piety, chastity, and martyrdom—who shed their mortal forms and transcended the world—have all become immortals. The woman recorded in the previous account, whose name and lineage were concealed, could this not be the Lady Li of the Five Dynasties?\n\n*Compendium of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao*, Scroll Five—concluded.\n*Sequel to the Compendium of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao*, Scroll Six.\n\nThe Qian Sisters of Perfected Truth\n\nThe two sisters of the Qian clan, both Perfected Truth practitioners, resided in seclusion reciting the *Yellow Court Scripture* at Swallow Grotto on Mount Mao. To this day, green peach trees and purple caltrop grow there. The elder sister soon donned a white silk robe and attained the Dao, entering the grotto. By the time the younger sister arrived, the grotto had already sealed itself. In the fifth year of Chunhua during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Song, Inspector Xiahou Jiazhen and five Daoist priests from Jianlong arrived to perform the Dragon Offering ritual. That night, thunder shook the earth, and the grotto reopened, its depth unfathomable. A clerk from the prefectural office ventured deep inside and encountered a Daoist who handed him a single lychee. After eating it, he no longer required grain. A poem by Tian Lin was inscribed on a board there:\n\n*At Swallow’s Mouth, the dragon pool’s clear mien,*\n*The Qian sisters’ lingering spirit remains unseen.*\n*Though the elder left, her traces still reside,*\n*When the younger returned, the grotto’s gate stood wide.*\n*Clouds drift like flying white silk’s trace,*\n*The spring’s murmur echoes the Yellow Court’s grace.*\n*Green peach blooms, purple caltrop gleams,*\n*Left for mortals to ponder in waking dreams.*\n\nCao Wenji\n\nCao Wenji was originally a courtesan from Chang’an. At four or five years old, she displayed a prodigious talent for literature and play, grasping the profound meaning of any book she read. People suspected she had cultivated this in a past life. As she matured, her beauty became unparalleled, and she excelled in calligraphy. Beyond drafting memorials, she inscribed every surface—silken curtains, windows—wherever her brush could reach, writing tens of thousands of characters daily. People called her the \"Calligraphy Immortal.\" Her brushwork was unrivaled in Guanzhong. Even renowned calligraphers like Zhou Langzhong of Yue and Ma Jiancha of the Imperial Censorate praised her endlessly upon seeing her work.\n\nHer family urged her to learn music, but she said, \"Such trivial arts—how could I delight in them? Only the inkstone’s pool and the brush’s tomb would bring me contentment in old age.\" Thus, her fame spread, and countless men of wealth and talent offered gold and jade to make her their companion. She replied, \"None of them are my match. Whoever wishes to be my partner must first submit a poem, and I shall choose for myself.\"\n\nFrom then on, hundreds of poems—long verses and short, exquisite lines—arrived daily, but none moved her. Then Ren, a scholar from Minshan visiting Chang’an, heard of her and rejoiced, saying, \"I have found my match.\" When asked how he knew, he replied, \"The phoenix perches in the parasol tree, the fish leaps in the deep—each finds its rightful place.\" He submitted a poem:\n\n*Before the Jade Emperor’s hall, a scribe divine,*\n*Once tainted by worldly dust, exiled from heaven’s shrine.*\n*No wonder fragrant flesh must cling to bone,*\n*For her cloud-robes once brushed the incense-throne.*\n\nUpon reading it, Wenji exclaimed, \"This is truly my husband! How else would he know my past?\" She vowed to serve him and begged him not to look elsewhere. Her family could not dissuade her, and they became husband and wife. From then on, through spring mornings and autumn evenings, they shared poems and wine, savoring each fleeting moment.\n\nFive years passed. On the last day of the third month, as they drank to bid farewell to spring, Wenji inscribed a poem:\n\n*In immortals’ realm, no summer, no fall,*\n*Red sun and clear wind fill the jade hall.*\n*If the tiled roof holds a path to the azure sky,*\n*Might we ride the five-colored rainbow on high?*\n\nAfter writing, she sighed, \"I was once a celestial scribe in the heavens, banished to the mortal world for two decades due to earthly attachments.\" Turning to Ren, she said, \"You, too, were once an immortal who attained the Dao, now exiled among men. I share a karmic bond with you, which is why I entrusted myself to you. Today, we shall depart together.\"\n\nSuddenly, celestial music filled the air, and an otherworldly fragrance permeated the room. The household, astonished, peered in and saw a crimson-robed official descending with a jade tablet inscribed in vermilion seal script: *\"Li Changji has newly composed* The Jade Tower Record*. The Heavenly Emperor summons you to inscribe the stele. Hasten your ascent without delay.\"*\n\nThe family protested, \"Li Changji was a poet of the Tang—three hundred years have passed! How can this be? It must be some trickery.\" Wenji smiled, \"This is beyond your understanding. Three hundred years in the mortal world are but a moment in the heavens.\" She and Ren changed into their celestial robes, bowed in reverence, and rose into the air. All saw clouds and mist shimmering, phoenixes and cranes swirling around them. Tens of thousands witnessed the spectacle. The place where they had lived was later named \"Calligraphy Immortal Lane.\" A record was inscribed in the fourth year of Qingli during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Song, the year *jiashen*.\n\nImmortal Maiden Zhao\n\nImmortal Maiden Zhao, whose given name was He, was a native of Lingling in Yongzhou. Her family lived in Zheng Prefecture. At twelve, while picking tea with a group, she wandered a few *li* and lost her companions. After walking another *li* or so, she came upon a ravine of extraordinary beauty—clear springs and smooth stones, flowers and trees intertwined, birds singing sweetly, mist and clouds drifting. A man walked among them, an extraordinary sight. He wore a star-embroidered cap and a robe of finest silk, smiling at her.\n\nThe maiden thought this a fitting place to dwell. She bowed and begged to be accepted as a disciple, offering to serve him. The bearded immortal said, \"You cannot stay here yet—you must be famished from your long journey.\" From his sleeve, he produced a peach and told her to eat it, adding, \"If you can finish it, you will one day ascend to the heavens. If not, you will remain on earth.\" She ate half and saved the other half to share with her family.\n\nThe immortal urged her to return quickly and not linger. When she arrived home, her mother and brother asked, \"Where have you been so long?\" To her surprise, a month had passed. From then on, she ate no grain, only fruit and water. She disliked speaking with ordinary people, sitting quietly all day in meditation. Her family, recognizing her difference, built a bamboo pavilion for her.\n\nOnly her brother and sister-in-law lived with her. At night, voices often echoed from her pavilion. One day, her brother climbed the pavilion to eavesdrop and saw the maiden speaking with a tall, bearded man—handsome, with star-embroidered cap and silk robe. She addressed him as \"Immortal Elder\" and said, \"You promised to visit the other day—why did you break your word?\"\n\nThe immortal elder replied, \"Just now, I was summoned to perform a rain ritual. I had to cover thirteen hundred *li* over Pengli Marsh, bringing three *chi* of rain in a single night—no easy task in this scorching heat. One dragon alone would not suffice, so I summoned six disciples to divide the labor. We called forth the clouds, summoned the dragons, drove the thunder, and spurred the lightning, and thus the task was accomplished. That is why I missed our appointment the other evening.\"\n\nAs he finished speaking, he added, \"Your brother and mother have overheard these celestial secrets. If word spreads, it may leak heavenly mysteries. I must depart now.\" With that, only a streak of white light pierced the window as he vanished.\n\nAt dawn, the maiden said to her brother, \"Fortune favors you that you did not persist in eavesdropping—it might have brought you harm.\"\n\nHer brother replied, \"I will not listen again, but I wish to know: if you have become an immortal, must you still perform tasks like summoning rain?\"\n\nThe maiden said, \"Among those who have attained immortality today, there are thousands who have yet to ascend to the heavens. They dwell on the Ten Isles and Three Mountains, in renowned caves and palaces, accumulating merit and cultivating conduct before they may rise. Some govern rivers and lakes, others oversee the netherworld, or preside over mountains and peaks. They bring benefit to all ages, remove harm from the world, heal the sick, dispel suffering, rescue the distressed, uphold the fallen, and aid the weak. Their hidden merits and secret virtues are manifold—no single deed can encompass them all. But immortals do not boast of their achievements; they fear being known, so mortals rarely learn of their deeds.\"\n\nHer brother asked, \"Then how are the merits and deeds of immortals recorded?\"\n\nThe maiden replied, \"There are immortal officials who oversee such matters. Each year, they record these deeds and present them to the Celestial Emperor, who then ranks them accordingly. Those with the highest merit advance in their immortal ranks.\"\n\nWhen Zhou Lianfu, the prefect of Daozhou, was relieved of his post and returned to the capital, he passed through Lingling. Upon meeting the maiden, he noticed a guest among them—his bearing was extraordinary, his gaze sharp and unyielding. The man did not bow to Lianfu. Though Lianfu seemed displeased, the man simply departed.\n\nLianfu asked, \"Who was that man, so arrogant and dismissive?\"\n\nThe maiden replied, \"That was Lü Dongbin, the immortal.\"\n\nLianfu hastily sent someone to pursue him, but he had already vanished. The maiden said, \"Wherever the immortal elder wishes to go, he arrives in an instant. In less than a quarter of an hour, he can traverse a thousand *li*.\"\n\nLianfu then asked the maiden, \"Where has the immortal elder gone now?\"\n\nThe maiden looked around and said, \"He is already in Kena Prefecture.\"\n\nLater, a scholar named Xia Jun passed through Yongzhou and asked the maiden, \"Where is Master Lü now?\"\n\nShe replied, \"Today, he is at Xinghua\n\nThe immortal maiden did not answer. Later, events unfolded exactly as she had foretold.\n\nWhen Minister Di led his southern campaign and passed through Yongzhou, he visited the maiden and asked, \"By imperial decree, I am to suppress the rebels. I wish to know of victory or defeat—will I crush them?\" The maiden replied, \"The rebels will surely be crushed.\" He asked further, \"Will I capture their ringleader?\" The maiden did not answer. Later, all came to pass as she had said.\n\nWhenever officials or travelers passed through Yongzhou, none failed to seek the maiden and inquire of fortune or misfortune. One day, the maiden said to her brother and sister-in-law, \"Heaven and earth do not reveal calamity or blessing to men beforehand, for fear of leaking the celestial mechanism. Now, with guests filling our door, though we cannot refuse their questions, to answer them would be to disclose the hidden secrets of heaven and earth. How then could we escape reproach from above? I must depart.\" She then bathed, donned her ceremonial robes, sat upright, and transformed. To this day, her true form remains preserved in the chamber.\n\n**Immortal Maiden Zheng**\n\nImmortal Maiden Zheng was a native of Huizhou. Her father, Eighth Master, studied the Dao. From childhood, the maiden lived with her father in an upper chamber. When guests arrived, her father received them below, while she descended bearing tea and broth—this was their custom. No one ever saw smoke or fire in her chamber above. After her father’s death, when his coffin was examined, she refused to bury him, saying, \"My father has not died.\"\n\nAt first, the maiden never left the city gates, yet some claimed to have seen her a hundred *li* away. The house where she dwelled had long since decayed. One autumn night, a great storm arose, and the house collapsed. Those nearby were alarmed, fearing she had been crushed. When they rushed to look, they found a wooden chair and bed unscathed, and the maiden still unharmed, as if asleep.\n\nSu Zhe (styled Ziyou), serving as magistrate of Xuxi, met her and remarked, \"Though she is already eighty, she remains a maiden.\" Ziyou asked, \"Marriage and family are the natural course of human life—why has the maiden never wed?\" She replied, \"I recite the *Scripture of Salvation* and thus remain so.\" When asked the reason, she said, \"This scripture was spoken by the Primordial Beginning, who existed before heaven and earth and stands beyond them. How could I not be thus?\" Ziyou asked, \"How can any being exist beyond heaven and earth?\" She replied, \"The Dao is just so.\" Ziyou pressed, \"What does the Dao have to do with this?\" She answered, \"What part of my being is not the Dao?\"\n\nZiyou found her words extraordinary. The next day, he prepared a vegetarian feast and invited the maiden. Upon arrival, she drank wine and ate meat without restraint. Ziyou gently inquired about the arts of nourishing life. She said, \"Your vessel is already broken—it will be difficult to attain the Dao.\" When he asked her to explain methods of guiding and refining *qi*, she dismissed them all, saying, \"None of these are right. One must simply cultivate the state of an infant.\" Ziyou asked, \"Some have seen you a hundred *li* away—was that not the infant’s doing?\" The maiden smiled but did not answer. Afterward, her fate became unknown.\n\nLiu Yan, the Immortal Maiden\n\nImmortal Maiden Liu Yan was a courtesan from Daizhou. During the Shaosheng era of Emperor Zhezong of the Song, an old woman came to her door begging for money. Liu’s family invited her in and prepared a meal. After eating, the old woman said, \"Are you content to remain here? Why not follow me? I will teach you the Dao.\" The maiden agreed and told her mother, \"Mother, the dowry in the chest is worth ten thousand gold, and you have other daughters to care for you. I beg to leave and study the Dao.\" Her mother refused, so Liu cut her hair, donned rough cloth, and went directly into the Taihang Mountains. There, she lived in a hut and went out daily to beg for food.\n\nAfter several years, one day she suddenly took leave of those she regularly begged from, saying, \"I have long troubled you all. Tomorrow, I shall depart.\" The people arrived at the appointed time to see her. Flames erupted from her hut, and the Immortal Maiden sat cross-legged in the fire, transforming. The world regarded this as a *fire liberation*.\n\nLady Yu the Perfected\n\nLady Yu the Perfected was originally a woman of common birth. She encountered an extraordinary person, ceased eating, and withdrew into the Zhongnan Mountains. Many scholar-officials held her in reverence. In the early Chongning era of Emperor Huizong of the Song, edicts were issued: to Maoshan for Liu Hun Kang, to Hailing for Xu Shenweng, to Zhongnan for Lady Yu the Perfected, and to Yiyang for Zhang Xujing. Daily, they gathered in the secret palace to expound upon the wonders of the Dao.\n\nThe Maiden of Mozhou\n\nIn the territory of Renqiu County in Mozhou, there was a market called Tangluan, where fish piled high like a hill. During the Daguan era of Emperor Huizong of the Song, a poor girl of unknown origin often dwelled in an abandoned shrine. Each morning, she would enter the market to beg for fish, which she would then roast and devour raw—no other food was ever seen to pass her lips. If someone gave her clothing, she would slash it to pieces with a knife. Should anyone approach her, she would curse them, or even stab them with her blade, so that none dared come near. Yet her appearance was graceful and lovely, her skin smooth as congealed cream. A local soldier once conceived the intent to violate her, but suddenly saw a great serpent coiled where she sat. Terrified, he retreated, and when he looked back, the seat had transformed into a precious lotus blossom. The poor girl said, \"I cannot remain here.\" Soon after, she vanished without a trace.\n\n**Immortal Maiden Yu**\n\nImmortal Maiden Yu was a native of Fengxiang. Initially, her family’s livelihood depended on selling tea, and she lived in a place called the Chamber of Fasting and Reflection. Though born to a humble family, she cherished purity from a young age, abstaining from meat and reciting the *Book of Laozi* daily. When her parents gave her money, she would save it to purchase discarded slips of paper and broken bamboo tablets, which she stitched into clothing to give to beggars. Before long, she discovered among these scraps the Daoist teachings of *xu*, *he*, *yan*, *chui*, and *xi*. After practicing them for a long time, she ceased eating grain. At fourteen, she refused to marry. Neighboring girls who were fond of divine transcendents flocked to visit her.\n\nOne day, they discussed the Hua Mountains, where a stone chamber was said to contain a jade casket holding an elixir formula. Many had sought it, but none could open the casket—it was likely a treasure of the Upper Clarity, accessible only to those of the Dao. \"I observe that this girl of the Yu family,\" they said, \"has studied the Dao, refused marriage, and already mastered grain avoidance. Perhaps she can open the jade casket.\" They went to ask her, and she agreed. The girls waited nearby as she entered the chamber. There, she indeed found the jade casket and opened it, retrieving the *Great Cavern Scripture*. Fearing the others would seize it, she emerged and told them, \"It is true, but I cannot open it.\" The crowd departed in disappointment.\n\nImmortal Maiden Yu returned home and studied the scripture day and night, following its methods until she attained the art of transcending the world and refining her form. She could walk upon inked paper or remain sealed in an outer casket for months. When her disciples opened it, they found only dust. Then, Immortal Maiden Yu would slowly shake out her robes and rise.\n\nEmperor Huizong of the Song heard of her and summoned her to the eastern capital, bestowing upon her the title of Perfected and presenting her with a poem:\n\n*A songstress beyond the clouds of the Three Mountains,*\n*Her heart unstained by a speck of worldly dust.*\n\nIn the early Jingkang era of Emperor Qinzong, she told her disciples, \"I shall depart now, but I will return in sixty years.\" Soon after, she transformed. Her disciples followed her instructions, preparing a large coffin with openings on both sides and placing it in a valley of the Zhongnan Mountains. Word spread, and crowds came to gawk. After several months, Immortal Maiden Yu suddenly arose and said to her disciples, \"I warned you not to let the masses observe me. Why have you allowed this? Quickly dig a pit twenty feet deep and place my coffin within.\" Once the pit was dug, she entered the outer coffin and ordered them to seal it. \"Can the crowds disturb me now?\" she asked.\n\nIt is said that one Xiang Tuan later obtained her teachings.\n\n**Immortal Maiden Zhang**\n\nImmortal Maiden Zhang was a native of Nanyang. The circumstances of her attainment of the Dao remain unclear. When someone fell ill, she would sit opposite them, close her eyes, and silently project *qi* to attack the ailment. The afflicted would soon feel warmth spreading in their chest, their complexion flushing as if heated. Then, a rumbling sound like thunder would arise. Even those suffering from deep-seated illnesses invariably recovered. For this, she was revered and admired by many nobles of the time.\n\nEmperor Huizong of the Song once summoned her to the Eastern Capital, but her whereabouts thereafter remain unknown.\n\n**Xu Daosheng**\n\nXu Daosheng was a woman from Shanyang Commandery who later entered Divine Radiance Abbey to become a Daoist. Hearing that the Divine Elder Xu resided in Hailing, she went to serve him. One day, she asked the elder in a leisurely manner: \"The human body is but an accumulation of filth and impurity—yet there are those in ancient times who ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Is this truly possible?\"\n\nThe Divine Elder replied: \"I have heard that on Mount Taihang there is a Cliff of Bone-Exchange. Those who seek to ascend lightly must first go there to exchange their bones before they may ascend to the Upper Clarity and be enrolled in the registers of immortals.\"\n\nAfter receiving the elder’s words, Xu Daosheng later sought out the Cliff of Bone-Exchange to behold it. Upon arrival, she saw the summit towering and precipitous, nearly inaccessible by land. Yet her resolve was unshakable, and though she risked her life, she did not falter. Grasping vines by the thousands, she trod the unfathomable depths and directly reached the perilous peak. There stood a vast hall, its beams soaring, and all around lay over a thousand \"lock-bones\" of immortals, seated in lotus posture beneath the eaves. Xu Daosheng placed black sumac incense into each of their mouths before returning. From that time onward, she vanished, and her whereabouts remain unknown.\n\n**Chen Yuyu**\n\nChen Yuyu was a native of Jinhua County in Quzhou.\n\nAt seventeen, she once invited her brother to journey to the Four Brightnesses in the Eastern Sea. While her brother rode in a boat, Chen Yuyu walked upon the water, and after several days, her clothes remained dry. Upon returning, she told others: \"In the water, I met the Lady Star Sovereign, who guided me to Penglai. Only then did I realize I was originally the thirteenth cave master.\" From that moment, she awakened, and thereafter abstained from grain. She became skilled in poetry and lyrics, and could foretell people’s fortunes and misfortunes. Nobles, officials, scholars, and commoners came daily to seek her counsel, filling the doorway with their shoes.\n\nIn the seventh year of Emperor Huizong of Song’s *Zhenghe* reign (1117), the prefect Liu An, along with the regional inspectors Lu Tianji and Wang Ruming, reported her to the court. She was summoned to the capital and bestowed the title *Miaojing Lianshi* (Master of Wondrous Stillness and Refinement). After her audience, she immediately begged to return to the mountains and was granted a palanquin for the journey. Her dwelling, where Guo Chongshi had once lived, faced Mount Ge the Immortal in front and rested against the Altar of the Immortal Maiden behind. She lived alone in a single chamber.\n\nDuring the *Zhenghe* era, the county magistrate He Tingjian presented her with a poem:\n*\"How many years have you dwelt in spirit, fasting from grain?*\n*Daylong behind closed doors, you sit in serene silence.*\n*In wordless pact with Ma Gu on the lofty peak,*\n*From the Basket Woman you received the wondrous Dao.*\n*Your merit and conduct transcend the Three Realms;*\n*Your name resounds, pure, through the Ninefold Heavens.*\n*Who might I ask of the Queen Mother of the West—*\n*Which in rank among Jinhua’s immortals is our master?\"*\n\nShe received many poems, but this was the one she favored.\n\nChen Yuyu composed thousands of poems before and after, many foretelling the fortunes and misfortunes of others. Her younger brother Zhao once asked: \"The verses you write—how is it their responses come so swiftly? How do you know these things?\" She replied: \"When I intone the name of a place, a celestial official arrives bearing a register. Five hundred years of past and future are all known to me. Fearing I might leak heavenly secrets, I couch my words in wind, flowers, snow, and moon, yet fortune and misfortune lie hidden within. Not only do I know these things—I also govern them. Formerly, I temporarily held the post of the Impermanent Constable, overseeing inquiries into life and death. Later, I temporarily held the post of the Yin Clerk, overseeing inquiries into the Six Transgressions: bribery of officials, the Five Inverses of unfilial conduct, licentiousness, theft, deceit, and wanton killing. Most people in the world incur these offenses, and thus many die from heavenly calamities. Those who avoid them may, within three generations, produce immortals. Recently, I have also been placed in charge of the Moon Terrace’s immortal registers. All those who are wise and perceptive are recorded therein. If they cultivate merit and conduct, they may become Moon Terrace immortals. In general, I exhort them to loyalty, filial piety, sincerity, and trustworthiness. Even at eighty or ninety, their appearance does not decline.\" Later, her ultimate fate remained unknown.\n\n**Wu, the Wondrously Luminous Perfected**\n\nWu, the Wondrously Luminous Perfected, was the daughter of a scholar from Jurong County. From childhood, she encountered an extraordinary person who taught her the secrets of cultivation. She ceased eating, and even water she did not drink. During the *Xuanhe* era of Emperor Huizong of Song, she was summoned to court and lodged in the residence of Cai Jing. Cai Jing presented her with a poem containing the lines: *\"Even the divine immortals of Guye drink only dew; / The Queen Mother of Guitai has not yet forgotten her peaches.\"* Soon after, she obtained permission to return to Qiantang. Before long, she wished to travel elsewhere.\n\nThose who inquired of her were told: \"The city is filled with black qi—you must leave at once.\" Within ten days, the disaster of the Jurchen invasion struck. The Perfected One’s skin was luminous and refined, her speech clear and pleasing to the ear. Though she never studied books, she answered all questions about past and present without hesitation. Later, she withdrew into seclusion on Mount Luofu in Huizhou.\n\n**Wu Yuanzhao**\n\nWu, the Perfected One, named Yuanzhao, was the daughter of a commoner from Xiaoshan in Kuaiji. While still in her mother’s arms, if her mother ate meat, she would refuse the breast all day, yet if her mother ate vegetables, she would nurse as before. Her mother found this strange and suspected something unusual. As she grew older, her family arranged a marriage to a wealthy man in the county. After accepting the betrothal gifts, she became sullen and dispirited. When instructed in women’s work, she would sit and doze off. Her mother beat her, and she apologized, saying: \"I dare not be lazy. Last night, a deity in golden armor told me that the Earth Goddess had summoned me. I went with him into the clouds, arriving at the vast palace beneath the Azure Sky. There, I saw lofty immortals seated upon the dais, with jade maidens standing in attendance. They called me to ascend and warned: 'You were once a jade maiden, but due to past transgressions, you were temporarily banished to the mortal world for thirty years. Now you have returned. Go back, abstain from grain, renounce the world, and cultivate the Dao.' When I awoke, I wished to stop eating, but my mother forced me.\" She then dreamed of the deity’s anger, who said: \"I commanded you not to eat—you have violated my warning.\" He split open her abdomen, removed her intestines and stomach, washed them in a jade basin, then returned them to her belly and sealed it. He then transmitted to her the *Lingbao Great Cavern Scripture*, the *Great Cavern Method of the Great Master of Returning Wind and Blending Harmony*, and the talisman of the Perfected One, instructing her to heal the sick of the world. Upon hearing this, her mother awoke in shock and said: \"You are no ordinary person. I will break off your marriage so you may fulfill your destiny.\" From then on, she lived alone in a quiet chamber. When asked, she used talismanic water to cure illnesses, and people from near and far rushed to seek her talismans. If invited to visit a home to treat an illness, she would have two servants carry her in a sedan chair. She carried no provisions, and if her attendants grew hungry mid-journey, she would buy two peaches, breathe upon them, and give them to the person. After eating one peach, they would not hunger for dozens of miles.\n\nAn investigating censor named Chen, who lived in Qiantang, used the *Celestial Heart Method* to treat illnesses. Beside his residence, he built a multi-story tower in a separate garden. A gardener reported seeing someone riding a horse across it, but Chen shouted them away, saying: \"How could such a thing be?\" In early spring, he lodged a sword-bearing guard below the tower and also heard the sound of horses. Soon after, a servant knocked at his door, urging him to return home, saying: \"Your youngest daughter is striking at the air as if something were restraining her.\" He saw it was true—his daughter had fallen into a stupor and remained unconscious for days. Chen went to the tower to perform a ritual and exorcise the disturbance. Fire erupted from the walls, and in his haste to flee, the flames subsided. He then summoned a Daoist to subdue the entity, but as the Daoist approached the door, his headscarf vanished, and the household grew fearful. Chen wrote a letter inviting Yuanzhao, who arrived in full ceremonial attire. Chen’s daughter rose to greet her at the door, laughing and speaking as if she had never been ill. Yuanzhao took her to stay in the tower. For three days and nights, nothing unusual was seen, and the girl remained at ease.\n\nHan Zichen, a descendant of a grand commandant and an official in the capital, once wrote a memorial to be presented to Heaven, recounting his encounter with the Supreme Lord’s rise to power—no one else knew of this. He invited Yuanzhao to submit it. She prostrated herself for a long while, then rose and recited the memorial’s contents word for word, saying: \"The Emperor commends your tranquility and lack of ambition, replying: 'Guard your duty for twelve hundred days, and the Ministry of Justice will reward your merit.'\" Later, all came to pass as she had foretold. From childhood, Han had suffered from a foot ailment that, when it flared, left him unable to bend or stretch. Yuanzhao massaged him, and he felt a fiery heat in his waist. She also rubbed his abdomen, which grew warm, and with a gentle touch, qi flowed from his toes. Immediately, he stood on the ground, and his ailment vanished. One of Han’s servants lodged in a cramped hut beside the main house. One night, he dreamed of a ghostly figure pressing down on him. He cried out and fled, encountering Yuanzhao on the way. Without telling her what had happened, he walked with her to the hut. Yuanzhao turned back at the threshold, saying: \"Someone who hanged themselves is in there. Their hair hangs loose, their tongue protrudes—they saw me and begged for deliverance.\" She wrote a talisman and ordered the servant to burn it. That night, he dreamed of the ghost apologizing, saying: \"I have received the true official talisman and been reborn. I will not return.\" The next morning, the door opened of its own accord.\n\nThe Han family prepared a bed for Yuanzhao to rest, but no breath was heard. Gradually, a cloud of green qi arose from her nose, and a baby about three inches long, the color of blue glass, shone light across the bed, circling above her abdomen. After a moment, it disappeared.\n\nA maid in the household of Duke Zhang Xun was pregnant past her due date and could not give birth. Yuanzhao was summoned. As the maids stood around, she looked only at the pregnant woman and sighed, saying: \"In your past life, you were a woodcutter who struck and killed a great serpent. Now, it has come to repay you—it is in your belly, eating your five organs to the end.\" She urgently told the Duke to have it removed. She wrote two talismans and gave them to the maid, who burned them as instructed and drank the water. She then gave birth to a large serpent. When the Duke heard of this, he was greatly alarmed and treated Yuanzhao with reverence, offering her gold and silk, which she refused. Later, she stayed with the Han family for a year. When she wished to leave, they tried to stop her, but she would not be deterred.\n\nShe sighed and took her leave, saying: \"I shall not come again.\" The crowd suspected she would soon ascend as an immortal. The next day, she boarded a boat and returned to Xiaoshan. Upon reaching home, she passed away without illness.\n\nPrior to this, over ten households in the town had each seen Yuanzhao dressed in Daoist robes, visiting their homes to converse. After some time, she would depart. Days later, some went to Yuanzhao’s home to inquire, only to be told by her family: \"She has died.\" Several townspeople who had encountered her in succession all said: \"She was just at my home yesterday—how could this be?\" Verifying the dates of their visits revealed they coincided with the day of her *shijie*. This occurred in the eleventh year of the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song.\n\n**Sun the Immortal Maiden**\nThe Immortal Maiden, surnamed Sun, was named Bu’er and styled the Serene One. She was the youngest daughter of Sun Zhonglan, a powerful clansman of Ninghai. In the second year of the Tianfu reign of Emperor Taizu of Jin, during the spring of the *wuxu* year, her mother dreamed of seven cranes dancing in the courtyard, their feathers shimmering. One crane gradually entered her embrace, and upon waking, she found herself pregnant. After three years, on the fifth day of the first month of the *jihai* year, the maiden was born. From birth, she was intelligent and gentle, her virtuous demeanor naturally refined.\n\nWhen the time came to arrange her marriage, her father, Zhonglan, heard that the alchemist Master Wumeng had praised Ma Yifu as possessing the qualities of a true immortal. Thus, he betrothed her to him. They had three sons, all of whom she instructed in proper conduct. Yifu, being immensely wealthy, often aided the poor, and the Immortal Maiden always supported him in these deeds.\n\nOne day, the Patriarch [Wang Chongyang] drew a scroll depicting hell and showed it to her, saying: \"If you can leave the household life, you will surely attain this reward.\" Yet she remained only partially convinced. That winter, the Patriarch vowed to seclude himself in the hermitage for a hundred days, eating only once every five days. Yifu personally delivered his meals and witnessed many divine transformations, which the Patriarch used to guide him ten times. He rescued souls from hell, warning ten times of the transgressions caused by the three karmic actions. Ten times he revealed the wondrous efficacy of the nine elixirs through the exchange of pears. He also bestowed upon them taro and chestnuts, imparting the precepts of the Dao.\n\nSeeing their attachment to wealth and possessions, which would ultimately lead to their ruin, the Patriarch feigned drunkenness one day and entered Yifu’s residence, lingering outside the Immortal Maiden’s bedchamber. She rebuked him for his impropriety and had the door locked, sending a servant to summon Yifu from the marketplace to inform him. Yifu said: \"The Master and I have been discussing the Dao without leaving our seats—how could this have happened?\" When they returned and unlocked the door, the room was empty. Peering into the locked hermitage, they saw the Patriarch soundly asleep. Only then did the Immortal Maiden begin to hold him in reverence and faith.\n\nAnother day, the Patriarch again painted a scroll of paradise and showed it to her, saying: \"If you truly leave the household life, you will surely receive this reward.\" A year later, in the summer of the *jichou* year, Zhou Botong of the prefecture donated his residence to establish the Golden Lotus Hall, inviting the Patriarch and [Ma] Danyang to reside there. On the fifth day of the fifth month, the Immortal Maiden abandoned her three sons, severed all worldly ties, and went to the hall seeking liberation.\n\nThat morning, the Patriarch sent Danyang away from the hall. When the Immortal Maiden arrived, he ordered her to burn her vow before the Dao and bestowed upon her the name *Bu’er* and the title *Serene One*. He also presented her with a poem:\n\n*\"The ten transformations of the pear trace your past karma,*\n*Heaven’s auspicious moment comes naturally.*\n*Why did you not depart sooner?*\n*It was only to await the golden lotus.\"*\n\nThe Patriarch then led her through the streets to beg for alms and instructed her to build a separate hermitage to reside in, where she would later transmit the essentials of the Dao. At that time, the Immortal Maiden was fifty-one years old.\n\nThat autumn, the Patriarch took Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma to Bianliang. The following year, the Patriarch ascended as an immortal. In the twelfth year, the *renchen* year, Danyang returned the Patriarch’s coffin to Liujiang in Zhongnan, where the Patriarch had originally established his hermitage. After the funeral rites were completed, Danyang observed mourning and guarded the tomb, living in a humble hut for sixteen years.\n\nIn the *bingshen* year, the Immortal Maiden also passed through Tong Pass, intending to delve deeper into the supreme principles of the *Cantong Qi* and resolve her lingering doubts. Danyang composed a *Langtaosha* to send to her, and she responded with a distant bow of gratitude. Both resided in separate hermitages, practicing the teachings they had received.\n\nLater, she moved east to Luoyang. There was another Immortal Maiden named Feng, commonly called Little Second Daughter. According to the preface written by the *jinshi* Wang Yu for her inscription: Feng the Immortal Maiden originally came from the Guanzhong region during the Huangtong reign and settled in the eastern capital. She did not reveal her surname, age, or place of origin. Judging by her accent, she seemed to be from Qin. She begged for food to sustain herself, her face unwashed and her hair unkempt, deliberately making herself appear filthy to distance herself from worldly demons. By day, she wandered madly through the bustling markets; by night, she took shelter in abandoned shrines.\n\nShe harbored no love or hatred, made no judgments of right or wrong. Abiding in effortless tranquility, she followed her nature and let things take their course. Thus she cultivated the Dao of immortality within while concealing her immortal traces without, yet could speak freely to expound profound truths. She once said:\n\n*\"Green leaves spread boundless across the sky,\nYellow blossoms bloom across the earth.\nA thousand leagues you seek in vain,\nTen thousand leagues you seize them forth.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n\n*\"When oil is spent and the lamp burns dry, the flame dies of itself—\nYet the one who trims the wick is seen again in the wind.\"*\n\nSuch words of hers were too numerous to record.\n\nWhen the Immortal Maiden arrived in Luoyang, she took up residence there. Feng the Immortal Maiden’s dwelling had two caves: she bade the Immortal Maiden to live in the lower cave while she herself occupied the upper. She would pile bricks and stones at the entrance, and whenever a man passed the lower cave, she would hurl them at him, so that external demons could not create obstacles. Through her guidance and encouragement, the Immortal Maiden attained the Way in six years. She then began to teach and transform others, and many turned toward her in devotion.\n\nShe once composed a *Busaizi* to instruct the assembly:\n\n*\"Grasp firm and don your robe,\nAwait the union of water and fire.\nFrom the ocean’s depths, ten thousand rays of rosy light arise—\nA single strike pierces the Three Passes.\nImmortal music plays again and again,\nAs I drink the wine of fermentation.\nNo wondrous elixir is needed—\nIn an instant, nine cycles of cinnabar are complete.\"*\n\nOn the last day of the twelfth lunar month in the twenty-second year of the *renyin* cycle, she suddenly addressed her disciples: \"My teacher in the realm of truth has summoned me to the Jasper Pool; the appointed hour is near.\" She then bathed, changed her clothes, and asked, \"What is the celestial hour now?\" They replied, \"It is the hour of *wu*.\" She ordered brush and paper be brought and wrote a verse to leave behind:\n\n*\"Three thousand merits fulfilled, I transcend the Three Realms,\nLeaping beyond the embrace of yin and yang.\nHidden or manifest, I roam freely—\nMy drunken soul shall never return to the Sea of Tranquility.\"*\n\nHaving written this, she sat cross-legged and passed away in an instant. A fragrant breeze scattered, and auspicious vapors lingered, refusing to disperse for an entire day.\n\nAt that time, Dan Yang was dwelling in a humble abode in Ninghai. Hearing immortal music resounding through the sky, he looked up and saw the Immortal Maiden riding upon a cloud of many colors. Jade maidens and immortal youths, bearing banners and insignia, escorted her before and behind. She leaned down and said to Dan Yang, \"I am returning to Penglai Isle first.\"\n\nIn the spring of the *xinchou* year of the Great Yuan, when the Prefect of Jingzhao, Lord Tian, was to inter the immortal remains of Master Chong Yang, Master Qing He, along with the masters of the ancestral court and the prefect’s officials, established the Qingzhen Abbey at the estate of Academician Li in Zhongnan County. They first opened the Immortal Maiden’s tomb and reinterred her remains in the Golden Lotus Hall of the abbey, establishing it as a sanctuary for Daoist women of all directions.\n\nIn the *jiachen* year, by imperial decree, the abbey was elevated to a palace. In the first month of the *jisi* year of the *Zhiyuan* era, she was posthumously enfeoffed as the Perfected One of Serene Depth, Chastity, and Virtuous Power.\n\n*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages, Scroll Six—End.*",

By the Shang dynasty, his family had transmitted the Dao of nurturing life from father to son. His father, Qingbin, lived over a hundred years yet retained a youthful appearance. He wandered among the Five Peaks and the various mountains, until one day a cloud and dragon descended to welcome him, and he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Inspired by his father’s ascension, Lingfei cultivated the Great Dao with diligence, and after more than a hundred days, he too ascended to heaven before Lord Lao’s birth.\n\nIn the eighteenth generation of the Shang dynasty, in the seventeenth year of King Yangjia’s reign—the year *gengshen*—Lord Lao divided His spirit and transformed His qi from the Great Clarity Realm. Riding the essence of the sun and driving a nine-dragon chariot, He descended as a five-colored flowing pearl. At that time, the Yin lady was napping in the daytime when she dreamed the sky opened for several *zhang*, and a host of immortals bore forth the sun. After a long while, the sun gradually shrank and fell from the heavens as a five-colored pearl, the size of a pellet. She cupped it in her hands and swallowed it, awakening to find herself with child. Today, at the Celestial Tranquility Palace in Bozhou, the Flowing Star Altar marks the site. Thereafter, her complexion grew ever more youthful, and her spirit remained serene. In the chamber where she dwelt, the six qi harmonized—winter brought no biting cold, nor summer any oppressive heat.",

      "translated_text": "The auspicious radiance illuminated her chamber, and no evil could assail her. Eighty-one years passed unnoticed. In the ninth year of King Wuding of the twenty-first Shang dynasty, the *gengchen* year, on the fifteenth day of the second month (the *jianyin* month) at the hour of *mao*, the sagely mother, grasping a plum branch, suddenly gave birth from beneath her left armpit. As recorded in the *Immortals’ Biographies*, all accounts state he remained in the womb for eighty-one years. Only the *Inner Transmission* states: The Supreme Master of the Celestial Court, moved by the essence of the sun entering her mouth, conceived. After seventy-two years, he emerged by cleaving her left armpit. Though the two accounts differ, there is reason for both. The *Yu Xuan’s Records of the Northern Frontier* states: Laozi remained in the womb for seventy-two years, with nine years of gestation thereafter—totaling eighty-one years.\n\nAt that moment, the sun’s brilliance doubled, auspicious clouds shaded the courtyard, ten thousand cranes soared in the sky, and the Nine Heavens resounded with celebration. Jade maidens knelt to cradle him, and nine dragons offered water to bathe his sacred form. Where the dragons emerged, nine wells formed. As recorded in Fu Tao’s *Records of the Northern Expedition*: Within Laozi’s temple stand nine wells, their waters all connected—drawing from one causes all nine to stir.\n\nAt his birth, he took nine steps, each step birthing a lotus. His left hand pointed to heaven, his right hand to earth, and he declared: “Between heaven and earth, only the Dao is supreme. I shall propagate the supreme Daoist teachings, universally delivering all sentient beings—whether moving or rooted—throughout the ten directions and the dark prisons of hell, redeeming all who await deliverance. Manifest or hidden, among humankind, I shall serve as the nation’s teacher and model.” Thus, he ascended to the rank of Supreme Immortal of the Great Ultimate, bearing the title *Pin* (or *Yan*—interchangeable in Han script), his given name *Er*, courtesy name *Boyang*. Some call him *Boyang Fu*, a term of reverence for the aged. Alternate names include: *Ya*, courtesy name *Bozong*; *Zhi*, courtesy name *Boguang*; *Shi*, courtesy name *Menggong*; *Chong*, courtesy name *Ziwen*; *Ding*, courtesy name *Yuanyang*; *Yuan*, courtesy name *Boshi*; *Xian*, courtesy name *Yuansheng*; *De*, courtesy name *Bowen*.\n\nNine days after his birth, his body underwent nine transformations, each time clad in celestial robes and a celestial crown, naturally adorned. He possessed seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences. The seventy-two marks were as follows: his head round as heaven, his face radiant as the sun and moon; his jade-like occiput arched, his hair white as a crane’s, over seven *chi* in length. His brows resembled the Northern Dipper, their color emerald green. His beard was tiger-like, his whiskers dragon-like, white and silken. His ears bore hanging pearls, with three passages within, rising level with his crown, thick and firm. His eyes were like rivers, his pupils square with green veins; his nose had twin pillars, its bridge high and prominent. His mouth was square as the sea, his lips red as cinnabar. His breath carried a purple hue, its fragrance like orchids. His teeth were like strung cowries, strong as silver, thirty-two in number, evenly aligned. His tongue was long and broad, patterned like brocade. His voice was like jade, its resonance like metal. His forehead was high and broad, his jaw square as a carpenter’s square. His temples bore the sun’s angle and the moon’s depth, his visage golden, his bearing jade-like. His dragon-like countenance was solemn, his phoenix-like gaze serene. His forehead bore the trigram *dui*, the three *wu* lines ascending. His celestial court was level and expansive, his golden coffer full. His cheeks bore white moles, his jaw a jade pellet. His neck had three folds, white and crane-like. His arms hung past his knees, his hands bore ten whorls. His fingers were slender and long, each marked with auspicious lines. His nails were like jade, his body covered in green down. His chest bore the *yan* bone, his back the *he kui*. His navel was over an inch deep, his belly soft as silk. His heart bore brocade-like patterns, his abdomen a dark intent. His eyes had wheel-like veins, his feet trod the two *pian* stars. His toes bore the symbols of *qian* and *kun*, his height twelve *chi*. His entire body exuded fragrance, his face square and lustrous. His form was proportioned in three equal parts, his body like vajra. His appearance was as luminous as lapis lazuli, his gait like a tiger’s, his movements like a dragon’s. Such were his marks.\n\nTo his left stood the Azure Dragon, to his right the White Tiger; before him the Vermilion Bird led, behind him the Dark Warrior followed. Purple clouds shaded his head, lotuses bore his feet, twin luminaries crowned his neck, and fivefold brilliance shone like the sun. His body bore the round symbol, illuminating the Nine Heavens. Combined with his previous immortal marks, their radiance was wondrously fair—eighty-one in total, called his excellences.\n\nHis gestation of eighty-one years fulfilled the supreme yang number of nine nines. Born with white hair, he was thus called *Lao* (Old). The ancients addressed teachers as *zi* (Master), and *zi* was also a general term for men, hence the name *Laozi*. He dwelled in Li Xiang of Qu Ren Village, Ku County, Chen State, on the northern bank of the Wo River—present-day Weizhen County in Bozhou.\n\nAfter giving birth to the Dao-incarnate body, the sagely mother returned to the celestial palace, resuming her position as the Primordial Lord. To demonstrate to the world the way of master-disciple transmission, she addressed Laozi: “All beings born between heaven and earth possess both purity and turbidity. Those of pure *qi* are clear-minded, compassionate, and kind; those of turbid *qi* are foolish, cruel, and violent. The enlightened cultivate to refine their nature; the deluded indulge desires to harm their lives. Nature is the source of the body; life is the root of existence. Thus, those who cultivate and study refine their bodies with the nine elixirs, untie the knots of the five spirits, guide *qi* to its origin, and sever the roots at the three barriers. Through nine refinements and ten transformations, the hundred joints become luminous. When the fetal knots are severed, one knows the original truth and ascends as a supreme immortal. Without cultivation, demonic influences enter the body, a hundred illnesses arise, life is not fully lived, and suffering is beyond words.\n\nImmortality arises from the heart’s study. With sincerity, immortality is achieved. The Dao values inner seeking; inner secrecy brings the Dao. Cultivate stillness to unite with the true, accumulate emptiness to commune with the divine, and the day of attaining immortality draws near. If the heart competes and the spirit labors, the body grows restless and unfocused, movement and stillness dissipate essence, the ears and eyes grow overly keen—even with long accumulation, the Dao remains distant. This sojourn in the world of heaven and earth is but a fleeting moment.”",

      "translated_text": "If one can gather qi to nourish the spirit, endure hardship to concentrate on the true, and persist long enough, one will attain the Dao and dwell with heaven and earth in the Great Void. When one can penetrate emptiness and embody nothingness, sight cannot perceive, hearing cannot detect—then one merges with the Dao in truth.\n\nLaozi said: \"Now, amidst the dust and chaos of the world, can one hope to preserve life eternally and guide others across the ages?\"\nThe Primordial Lord replied: \"I possess a secret treasure, transmitted only to the sagely. Those who cultivate it may endure forever.\"\nLaozi said: \"I wish to hear of its attainment.\"\nThe Primordial Lord said: \"The supreme Dao is profound and obscure, beyond all knowing. Neither being nor non-being, neither sound nor form. Invisible when sought, intangible when grasped. It encompasses heaven and earth, boundless and infinite. Yet it lies near within each body, unfathomable to all. To know its principle is called mysterious virtue.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Does the Dao also have methods to attain it?\"\nThe Primordial Lord said: \"The Dao is the ultimate truth of emptiness and penetration; methods are the wondrous arts of transformation. The Dao employs methods to aid humanity, and through cultivation, one meets the Dao—then transformations become limitless. The essence of the Dao lies in non-action and spontaneity; the secrecy of methods lies in talismans, qi, and elixirs alone. Talismans are the numinous script of the Three Luminaries, the true nature of heaven. Elixirs are the essence and bloom of the Five Phases, the vital fluid of earth. Qi is the harmonious purity of yin and yang, the spirit and brightness of all things. Though one may master a single practice, one must still rely on talismans, elixirs, and the Dao to complete it. This is my secret treasure. To master them together is to endure forever and deliver countless beings.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The body is the vessel for attaining the Dao; qi is the root of life. When the root is severed, life ends; when the vessel decays, the Dao departs. Now, if one wishes to cultivate it so that life is secure and the Dao flourishes, may I hear how?\"\nThe Primordial Lord said: \"Humans are endowed with bones and flesh, like clay in a potter’s hands. If the clay is left unworked, it quickly spoils; if the body is left unrefined, life is short—such is the principle. Even if one’s virtue surpasses all others and the spirit communes with the Great Mystery, the body still cannot escape aging and death. Why is this? It is the nature of transformation, inevitable and unyielding. Only elixirs can refine the form, and only talismans can summon the spirit. When the spirit returns, the heart opens and the nature is at ease; when the form is firm, qi is secure and life is preserved. Then, transforming qi into essence, one penetrates formlessness, soars through the void, and masters life and death—thus enduring forever. Those who attain the Dao, though they face the turning of kalpas and the collapse of heaven and earth, remain untouched by disaster. This is why talismans and elixirs are so precious.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who ingest the divine elixir and live forever—is it the protection of spirits, or the power of the elixir?\"\nThe Primordial Lord said: \"The merit of long life lies in the elixir; the elixir’s completion lies in the spirit. Thus, when compounding the elixir, one must rectify body and mind, avoid transgressions, and the spirit will protect it—then the elixir will surely form. When the divine elixir enters the mouth, life knows no end. Heaven and earth bear witness: the Dao returns to the benevolent. The teeming masses, like walking corpses, do not believe long life can be learned, dismissing it as empty fantasy. From dawn to dusk, they engage only in acts that hasten death—how can heaven force them to live? Indulging desires to the full, they perish in an instant, and though a thousand gold pieces are spent on their burial, what benefit is there? When the Way of the divine elixir is perfected, not only does one attain long life, but it may also become a treasure of the world. Those who know this Way—what need have they for the world? If one offered a kingdom in exchange for my formula, I would not transmit it to the unworthy.\"\n\nLaozi bowed deeply and said: \"I wish to hear its essentials.\"\nThe Primordial Lord then raised his head and let out a long whistle. Suddenly, a purple cloud like a canopy descended from the heavens, suffused with five colors and radiant light spreading in all directions. The immortal Juanzi attended him, and the Primordial Lord unfurled the sacred charts of divine transformations, the methods of returning elixirs, refining cinnabar, subduing fire, and the arts of liquid mercury and gold—seventy-two scrolls in all—and bestowed them upon Laozi. Their texts read:\n\n*First, the Mysterious White gives birth to the Golden Elder,\nThe sun’s flowing pearl enters the Flowery Pond.\nWithin the pound, five taels of patterned cinnabar gather,\nRed salt and white snow form the male and female.\nWith the Five Talismans and Nine Elixirs, one may ascend—\nThe true Way lies here, yet none know it.*\n\nThe Five Talismans are: first, the Mysterious White; second, the Golden Essence; third, the Flying Talisman; fourth, the Golden Bloom; fifth, the Three-Five Azure Dragon Essence.\nThe Nine Elixirs are: first, the White Snow Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; second, the Male-Female Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; third, the Yellow Bloom Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; fourth, the White Bloom Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; fifth, the Elixir Bloom Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; sixth, the Five-Color Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; seventh, the Clay Mercury Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; eighth, the Golden Essence Nine-Turn Returning Elixir; ninth, the Nine Cauldrons’ Radiant Ultimate Elixir. Of these nine elixirs, obtaining even one allows one to live forever—there is no need to practice them all.\n\nThe Way of the divine elixir undergoes three transformations and five turns, culminating in nine. Those who ingest it become equal to me. The Way of immortals does not lie in sacrifices or prayers to spirits, nor in guiding and stretching exercises, nor in sighing wishes or verbose speech, nor in exhausting oneself with intense thought. The essence of long life lies in the divine elixir—knowing it is easy, but practicing it is truly difficult. If you can follow it, you may endure forever. This Way exists to attain immortality; even I learned it—it is not innate.\"\n\nLaozi bowed again and said: \"I have received your gracious instruction on the Nine Elixirs. Yet I have heard that without the Golden Liquid, one’s efforts to seek immortality are in vain. I humbly wish to know its essentials.\"\nThe Primordial Lord said: \"Your question is profound indeed. The Nine Elixirs and the Golden Liquid are both paths to ascending to heaven. Yet among the Nine Elixirs, the Golden Liquid is supreme. Those who ingest the Nine Elixirs may, after three years, two years, one year, half a year, a hundred days, sixty days, thirty days, or even three days, be welcomed by immortal officials with clouds and dragons.\"",
      "overlap_context": " achieved. The Dao values inner seeking; inner secrecy brings the Dao. Cultivate stillness to unite with the true, accumulate emptiness to commune with the divine, and the day of attaining immortality draws near. If the heart competes and the spirit labors, the body grows restless and unfocused, movement and stillness dissipate essence, the ears and eyes grow overly keen—even with long accumulation, the Dao remains distant. This sojourn in the world of heaven and earth is but a fleeting moment.”",

      "translated_text": "Only those who ingest the Golden Liquid will, upon taking it into their mouths, find their bodies suffused with a hue of purple-gold, wings sprouting forthwith, ascending to heaven to become immortal officials. Those who wish to ingest it must first observe a prolonged fast, abstain from grains for a full year, and only then may they partake of it. Unless one’s name is recorded in the Register of the Mysterious Center and bears the title of the Undying, one shall never hear of the Way of the Golden Liquid. Its method follows the previous alchemy of compounding the elixir; once the gold is formed, it is liquified, and the Way is complete. This is my secret treasure. It comprises one thousand two hundred incantations, which I received from the Primordial Celestial Worthy in the distant kalpas before the dust of countless worlds arose. I practiced them faithfully and thus attained the rank of Supreme Primordial Lord. In former times, I transmitted them to the Perfected, the Great Sage, the Celestial Emperor, the Supreme Emperor, and the Primordial Lord of the Grand Tenuity and Grand Unity. Now I bestow them upon you—strive diligently in their cultivation.\"\n\nLaozi, having received the transmission, again inquired: \"The teeming multitudes of the world, driven to the brink of death—if this Way were widely bestowed to deliver them, how might it be done?\"\n\nThe Primordial Lord replied: \"The careless masses, lost in indulgence and desire, perish like stones cast into rivers, gone without return—how grievous and lamentable! Yet the Dao does not act in vain; it must be entrusted to the worthy. This Way is lofty and wondrous, concealed within the Nine Mysteries’ Jasper Terrace and Cloudy Peaks. Once in ten thousand years, it is transmitted only to those whose names are inscribed in the Mysterious Register. Unless one is destined by innate bone and has endured the trials of alchemical refinement, one shall not hear of it. Fools err repeatedly, only then seeking to purge their faults—how could one defy celestial decree and recklessly divulge it? My teachings end here. I shall depart now, but the Primordial Lord of the Grand Unity will speak with you further.\"\n\nAs he finished speaking, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, the Perfected of the Five Emperors, escorted him in an eight-scene jade carriage, ascending to heaven.\n\nThe *Divine Elixir Scripture of the Grand Clarity* records that its method originates from the Supreme Primordial Lord. Its divine power harmonizes yin and yang, commands wind and rain, advances and retreats the five stars, and regulates cold and heat. It harnesses nine dragons and twelve white tigers, and all immortals under heaven revere and submit to it. The life and death of humankind are governed by this—indeed, it is said to arise from the ingestion of the elixir.\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Grand Unity\nLaozi then wandered through mountains and marshes, seeking to refine the divine elixir. Passing through Mount Lao, he encountered the Primordial Lord of the Grand Unity, riding a five-colored mottled qilin, attended by dozens of officials. Laozi followed and inquired of the Way. The Primordial Lord said: \"The essence of the Dao lies in the returning elixir and the Golden Liquid.\" Thereupon, he fully transmitted the secret incantations. In later years, on Mount Li, Laozi again met the Primordial Lord of the Grand Unity and expressed gratitude for the divine elixir’s method. The Primordial Lord replied: \"I am the sovereign of all immortals, the master of the myriad Ways. The mysterious and numinous arts are rooted in the profound—why should you demean yourself with thanks?\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The common people, ignorant and dying in great numbers, move me to tears of blood. I grieve to see it. If I could bestow upon them the divine medicine, allowing all to attain longevity, would it be permissible?\"\n\nThe Primordial Lord replied: \"It may not be done. The Way of life is most weighty; it must be entrusted only to the greatly virtuous, the filial, the sincere, and the steadfast. Heaven generates the myriad things—some good, some evil. The good are fit to live; the evil are fit to be eradicated. It is not fitting to dispense the medicine to all, allowing them to live. You already understand this—do not lightly disclose it.\"\n\nLaozi, recognizing that the Way of immortality requires cultivation, wished to leave behind a method to encourage future generations. Thus, he preserved authenticity, embraced the One, refined the elixir, and ingested qi. Thereafter, he soared through the void, transcending existence and non-existence, traveling wherever he willed, beyond mortal comprehension. One day, he mounted a white deer, trod upon the cypress of the courtyard, and ascended to heaven.\n\nThe Primordial Lady of Metal\nThe Primordial Lady of Metal is the Nine Numinous, Most Wondrous, Tortoise Mountain Primordial Lady of Metal. She is also called the Most Numinous Nine Radiance, Tortoise Terrace Primordial Lady of Metal, and the Queen Mother of the West. She is the supreme mystery of the Western Florescence, the ultimate honor of the Dark Yin. In ancient times, when the qi of the Dao congealed in stillness, her essence abided in non-action. Desiring to initiate the profound work of generating and transforming the myriad things, she first transformed the Perfect Qi of the Eastern Florescence, giving birth to Lord Wood. Lord Wood was born upon the Azure Sea, in the Wilderness of the Blue Numinous, to govern the qi of harmonious yang in the East—he is also called the Lord King of the East. Then, from the Perfect Qi of the Western Florescence, she transformed and gave birth to the Primordial Lady of Metal. The Primordial Lady of Metal was born in the Divine Continent’s Yi River, her surname being Hou. Born with the ability to soar, she governs the qi of numinous yin in the West—she is also called the Queen Mother. Both emerged with great primordial substance, nurturing the mysterious and profound. In the vast wilderness of the West, they divided the pure essence of the Great Dao, condensing qi into form. Together with Lord Wood of the East, they govern the two qi, nurturing heaven and earth, shaping the myriad things.\n\nTheir essence embodies the root of gentleness and compliance, the origin of ultimate yin. Their position corresponds to the West, where they mother and nourish all beings. In heaven above and below, across the Three Realms and Ten Directions, all women who ascend as immortals and attain the Dao are subject to her. Her palaces and towers reside on Tortoise Mountain’s Chong Mountain, in the Garden of the Kunlun’s Mysterious Orchard and the Gate of the Wind. There are a thousand layers of golden walls, twelve jade towers, jasper palaces, halls of luminous azure, nine-tiered mysterious terraces, and vermilion chambers of purple and emerald. To the left flows the Jasper Pool; to the right winds the Emerald River. At the mountain’s base lie nine layers of weak water, with waves ten thousand fathoms high—none may reach it without a wind-driven carriage or feathered conveyance.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* and the *Divine Verifications of the Emperors* state: The Queen Mother’s realm lies in the wilds of the Western Wastes. There stand jade towers firm as heaven, green terraces supporting the clouds, chambers of azure jade, and halls of vermilion and purple. Linked jade canopies and luminous curtains glow with the brightness of four moons. She wears floral crowns and bears numinous insignia. To her left attend immortal maidens; to her right, feathered youths. Her jeweled canopy casts a distant glow; feathered ornaments shade the courtyard. Beneath the balustrades grow trees of white jade and forests of cinnabar-hardness. Ten thousand branches of malachite, a thousand trunks of jasper—though no wind blows, divine music arises of its own, resonating with the eight harmonies.\n\nThe Divine Continent lies southeast of Kunlun, hence the *Erya* states: \"The Queen Mother of the West is beneath the sun.\"",

      "translated_text": "It is further said: \"The Queen Mother with flowing hair and a sheng-crown, tiger-teeth and a piercing cry—this is but her messenger, the White Tiger Spirit of the Metal Realm, not her true form.\" The Primordial Heavenly King bestowed upon her the governance of the myriad heavens, the *Nine Radiance Register of Mount Gui*, commanding her to summon all spirits, unify the perfected sages, oversee oaths and bear witness, and preside over the feathered regalia of all heavens. At the assemblies where the Heavenly Worthy and Supreme Saints gather for feasting and judgment, the Queen Mother ever attends in radiant presence.\n\nThe precious scriptures of the *Shangqing*, the Three Caverns, and the jade texts—all that she transmits and ordains—are matters in which she holds sway. In ancient times, when the Yellow Emperor campaigned against the tyranny of Chiyou, his might could not prevail, for Chiyou wrought manifold illusions, summoning winds and calling rains, exhaling mists and spewing fog, so that the imperial host fell into utter confusion. The Emperor withdrew to rest at the foot of Mount Tai, sunk in troubled slumber. The Queen Mother dispatched a messenger clad in a robe of dark fox-fur, who presented him with a talisman, saying: \"With the Great Unity before you, he who obtains it shall triumph; in battle, he shall conquer.\" The talisman measured three inches in breadth and one foot in length, lustrous as jade, its script traced in cinnabar. Once the Emperor had fastened it to his person, the Queen Mother sent forth a woman with a human head and the body of a crow, who addressed him: \"I am the Dark Woman of the Nine Heavens.\" She imparted to him the esoteric arts of the Three Offices and Five Intentions, the mysteries of yin and yang, the techniques of the Great Unity, the *Dun Jia*, the *Liu Ren*, the pacing of the Dipper, the mechanisms of the *Yin Fu*, and the sacred texts of the Five Talismans and Five Victories. Thereupon, he vanquished Chiyou in the heartland of Jizhou.\n\nAfter Shennong’s time, Yu Gang was executed at Banquan, and the realm was brought to great peace; the capital was established at Zhuolu in Shanggu. Some years later, the Queen Mother sent the White Tiger Spirit, who rode a white tiger to the Emperor’s court and presented him with a terrestrial map. In his later years, she again bestowed upon him the precepts of purity, non-action, and the rectification of the true, declaring: \"Cease not from eating and drinking, and the body shall not be light; cease not from thought and worry, and the spirit shall not be clear; cease not from sound and color, and the heart shall not be at peace. If the heart is not at peace, the spirit shall not be efficacious; if the spirit is not efficacious, the Dao shall not be attained. Its essential subtlety lies not in gazing at stars or worshipping the Dipper, nor in afflicting the self or exhausting the body. Its nobility resides in the serenity of the square inch of the heart, free from all restless striving. Only thus may the Way of the immortals be mastered, and long life secured.\"\n\nLater, when Yu Shun assumed the throne, the Queen Mother sent a messenger to present him with a white jade ring and bestowed upon Yi a terrestrial map, thereby expanding the Yellow Emperor’s Nine Provinces into twelve. The Queen Mother further dispatched a messenger to grant Shun the *huangguan* flute, by whose playing the eight winds were harmonized.\n\nIn the twenty-fifth year of King Zhao of Zhou, the cyclical year *yimao*, the Venerable Lord Lao and the Perfected One Yin Xi journeyed beyond the Eight Cords to wander in the west, arriving at Tortoise Terrace, where they expounded the *Changqingmo Jing* to the Queen Mother of the West. Thus, the Left Palace Immortal Duke Ge Xuan of the Great Ultimate later recorded: \"I once received it from the Lord Emperor of the Eastern Flower; the Lord Emperor of the Eastern Flower received it from the Lord Emperor of the Golden Watchtower; the Lord Emperor of the Golden Watchtower received it from the Queen Mother of the West—all transmitted orally, without written record. Now, in this world, I commit it to writing.\"\n\nIn the time of King Mu, he commanded a chariot drawn by eight steeds: on the right rein, *Pili* and *Lü’er*; on the left, *Chiji* and *Baiyao*.

      "translated_text": "The Giant Sou clan presented the blood of a white crane for the king to drink and prepared a broth of oxen and horses to wash his feet. When the two chariots' attendants had drunk and set forth on their journey, they lodged at the slopes of Kunlun, on the northern bank of the Red Water. The next day, they ascended the heights of Kunlun to behold the palace of the Yellow Emperor and sealed it with earth to petition for posterity. Then they were received as guests by the Queen Mother of the West, who feasted the king upon the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother sang for the king, and the king harmonized with her, their verses unfolding as one. They observed the place where the sun sets, traveling ten thousand *li* in a single day.\n\nThe king sighed and said, \"I, alone, am not full in virtue; will later generations recount my faults?\" It is also said: the king held a white jade tablet and layered brocade to offer longevity to the Queen Mother. He sang the \"Song of the White Clouds\" and carved an inscription upon the border at Mount Yi before returning.\n\nThe *Bamboo Annals* states: \"In the seventeenth year of his reign, King Mu journeyed west, met the Queen Mother of the West, and was received as a guest at the Radiant Palace.\"\n\nAmong those who ascend to heaven as immortals, there are nine ranks:\nThe first, the Supreme Immortal, is titled the True King of the Nine Heavens.\nThe second, the Lesser Immortal, is titled the True Sovereign of the Three Heavens.\nThe third is titled the Perfected of the Supreme, the fourth the Flying Perfected,\nthe fifth the Numinous Immortal, the sixth the Perfected,\nthe seventh the Numinous Being, the eighth the Flying Immortal,\nand the ninth the Immortal.\nThese ranks must not be transgressed.\n\nWhen ascending to heaven, one must first bow to the Lord of the East, then pay homage to the Queen Mother of the West. Only after completing these rites may one ascend to the Nine Heavens, enter the Three Clarities, bow before the Supreme, and behold the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning.\n\nThus, in the early Han dynasty, four or five children played by the roadside. One among them sang:\n*\"Donning a blue skirt, entering the Gate of Heaven,\nbowing to the Queen Mother of the West, saluting the Lord of the East.\"*\nNo one present understood, save Zhang Zifang, who went forth to bow and said, \"These are the jade lads of the Lord of the East.\" For when immortals attain the Dao and ascend to heaven, they must salute the Queen Mother of the West and bow to the Lord of the East. None but those who have attained emptiness and ascended to perfection know this path.\n\nEmperor Wu of Han was fond of the Dao of longevity. In the first year of the *Yuanfeng* era, he ascended Mount Songgao, built the Terrace of Seeking the Perfected, and fasted with utmost devotion. On the *wuchen* day of the fourth month, the Queen Mother dispatched Wang Zideng, a jade maiden of Tang City, to address the emperor: \"I hear you wish to relinquish the emoluments of the Four Seas and forsake the dignity of the myriad chariots to seek longevity.

      "original_text": "帝问东方朔审其神，应乃清斋百日，焚香宫中。 夜二唱后，白云起于西南，郁郁而至，径趋宫庭。 渐近则云霞九色，箫鼓震空。 龙凤人马之众，乘麟驾鹿之卫，科车天马，霓旅羽幢，千乘万骑，光耀宫阙。 大仙从官，森罗亿众，皆长丈余。 既至从官所在，王母乘紫云之辇，驾九色斑龙，带天真之策，佩金刚灵玺。 黄锦之服，文彩鲜明，金光奕奕。 腰分景色之剑，结飞云大绶。 头上华髻，戴太真晨缨之冠。 蹑方琼凤文之履。 可年二十许，天姿奄霭，灵颜绝世，真灵人也。 下车，二女扶侍，登床东向而坐。 帝拜跪问寒温，侍立良久，呼帝使坐。 设以天厨，芳华百果，紫芝萎蕊，纷若顼，精珍异常，非世所有，帝不能名也。 又命侍女取桃，玉盘盛七枚，大如鹌音保，与捣同子。 四以与帝，母自食三。 帝食桃，辄收其核。 母问何为，帝曰：欲种之尔。 母曰：此桃三千岁一实，中国土地薄种之不生。 於是命王子登弹八珍之傲，董双成吹云和之笙，石公子击昆廷之玉，许飞琼鼓震灵之簧，婉凌华村吾陵之石，范成君拍洞阴之磬，段安香作九天之钧，法婴歌玄灵之曲。 众声激清，朗音骇空。 歌毕，帝下席叩头，以问长生之道。 王母曰：汝能贱荣乐卑，耽虚味道，自复佳尔。 然汝性恣体欲，淫乱过甚，杀伐非法，奢侈恣性。 夫侈者裂身之具也，淫者破身之斧也，杀者响对，奢者心烂，积欲则神损，聚秽则命断。 以子蕞尔之身而宅残形之贼，盈尺之材而攻之者百刃，欲以解脱三尸，全身永久，不可得也。 有似无翅之钨愿鼓天池，朝生之菌而乐春秋者也。 若能荡此众乱，拨秽易意，保神气於绛府，闭瑶宫而不开，静奢侈以寂室，爱众生而不危，守慈务施，炼气惜精。 倘有若斯之事，岂无髻霏邪。 若不尔者，譬如抱石而济长河尔。 帝跪受王母之诚，曰：彻不才，沉沦流俗，承禅先业，遂羁世累，刑政乖缪，罪积丘山。 今日之后，请事斯语矣。 王母曰：夫养性之道，理身之要，汝固知矣，但在勤行不息也。 我师元始天王昔於严霄之台，授我要言，曰：欲长生者取诸身，坚守三一保灵根。 玄谷华体灌沈珍，既长清精入天门。 金室宛转在中关，青白分明适泥丸。 养液闭精具身神，三宫备卫存绛宫。 黄庭戊己无流源，彻通五藏十二轮。 吐纳六府魂魄欣，却此百病辟热寒，保精留命永长存。 此所谓呼太和，保守自然，真要道者也。 凡人为之，皆必长生，亦可役使鬼神，游戏五岳，但不得飞空腾虚而已。 汝能为之，足可度世也。 夫学仙者，未有不由此而始也。 至若太上灵药，上帝奇物也。 下阴生重云妙草，皆神仙之药也。 得上品者，后天而老，乃太上之所服，非下仙之所逮。 其次药有九丹，金液、紫华、虹英、太清、九转、五云之浆、玄霜绛雪、腾跃三黄、东瀛白香。 玄洲飞生、八石千芝、威喜九光、西流石胆、东沧青钱、高丘余粮、积石琼田、太虚还丹，盛以金兰、长光绛草、雪童飞干，有得服之，白日升天。 此飞仙之所服，非地仙之所闻。 其下药有松梧之膏、山姜、沈精、菊华、泽泻、枸杞、狭苓、莒蒲、门冬、巨胜、黄精、灵飞、赤板、桃胶、木英、升麻、续断、威袭、黄连，如此下药，略举其端。 草类繁多，名数有千，子得服之，可以延年，虽不能长享无期，上升青天，亦可以身生光泽，返老童颜，役使群鬼，得为地仙。",
      "translated_text": "The emperor questioned Dongfang Shuo to verify the divinity’s authenticity. Shuo then purified himself with a hundred days of fasting and burned incense within the palace. After the second watch of the night, white clouds arose from the southwest, dense and billowing, advancing directly toward the palace courtyard. As they drew near, the clouds and mist took on nine hues, while flutes and drums shook the heavens. A throng of dragons, phoenixes, men, and horses—escorts riding unicorns and deer—accompanied chariots of jade, celestial steeds, banners of rainbow and feathers, and a procession of a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, their radiance illuminating the palace towers. The great immortals and their retinue, arrayed in countless ranks, all stood over a *zhang* tall. Once they reached their appointed stations, the Queen Mother descended from her purple-cloud carriage, drawn by nine multicolored striped dragons, bearing the Heavenly Perfected Staff and the Golden Cinnabar Seal. Her robes of yellow brocade shimmered with vivid patterns, their golden light resplendent. At her waist hung the Sword of Radiant Splendor, tied with the Grand Sash of Flying Clouds. Upon her head rested an ornate topknot, crowned with the Dawn Diadem of the Supreme Perfected. Her slippers were embroidered with square jade and phoenix motifs. Though she appeared no older than twenty, her celestial grace was overwhelming, her divine countenance unmatched in the world—a true spirit among mortals.\n\nAlighting from her carriage, two maidens supported her as she ascended the dais and sat facing east. The emperor knelt in obeisance, inquiring after her well-being, and stood in attendance for a long while before she bade him sit. She then presented him with the delicacies of the Heavenly Kitchen: fragrant blossoms, a hundred rare fruits, purple mushrooms and tender buds, their forms intricate and exquisite—treasures beyond the mortal realm, which the emperor could not name. She further commanded her attendants to bring peaches, seven of which were arranged upon a jade platter, each as large as a goose egg, their flesh like that of a jujube. Four she gave to the emperor, while she herself ate three. As the emperor consumed the peaches, he gathered their pits. When the Queen Mother asked why, he replied, “I wish to plant them.” She said, “This peach bears fruit but once every three thousand years. The soil of the Middle Kingdom is too meager for it to grow.”\n\nThereupon, she ordered Wang Zideng to pluck the strings of the Eight Rarities, Dong Shuangcheng to play the *yunhe* reed pipe, Shi Gongzi to strike the jade chimes of Kunlun, Xu Feiqiong to sound the divine reed organ, Wan Linghua to tap the stone chimes of Wuling, Fan Chengjun to beat the dark-toned chime, Duan Anxiang to perform the Nine Heavens’ melody, and Fa Ying to sing the *Xuanling* hymn. Their voices soared in crystalline purity, their clear notes startling the heavens. When the song concluded, the emperor descended from his seat, kowtowed, and inquired about the Dao of longevity.\n\nThe Queen Mother replied, “If you could scorn glory and delight in humility, immerse yourself in emptiness and savor the Dao, that would indeed be excellent. Yet your nature is indulgent, your desires unrestrained, your debauchery excessive, your killings unlawful, and your extravagance unbounded. Extravagance is the tool that rends the body, lust the axe that shatters it. Killing invites retribution, excess rots the heart. Accumulated desires deplete the spirit; gathered filth severs life. With your fragile frame as a den for thieves of decay, and your scant flesh assailed by a hundred blades, how can you hope to shed the Three Corpses, preserve your body, and endure forever? It would be like a wingless crane aspiring to soar over the celestial pools, or a morning mushroom hoping to enjoy the seasons. If you could sweep away these disorders, purge your impurities, and renew your resolve; safeguard your spirit and *qi* within the Crimson Palace, seal the Jade Chamber and never open it; still your extravagance in quietude, cherish all beings without harm; uphold compassion, practice generosity, refine your *qi*, and treasure your essence—then perhaps you might yet ascend in a halo of mist. If not, you are like one embracing a stone while fording a great river.”\n\nThe emperor knelt to receive the Queen Mother’s admonitions, saying, “I, Zhe, am unworthy, sunk in the mire of the vulgar world. Inheriting the legacy of my ancestors, I have been shackled by worldly burdens. My governance has been flawed, my crimes as vast as mountains. From this day forth, I shall heed your words.”\n\nThe Queen Mother replied, “The Dao of nurturing life and the essence of cultivating the body—you already know these principles. The key lies in diligent, unceasing practice. My master, the Primordial Heavenly King, once imparted to me on the Terrace of Stern Clarity these essential words: *‘To attain long life, draw from within yourself. Firmly guard the Three Ones and preserve the root of spirit. Bathe the Mystic Valley and the Flowery Body in the essence of deep tranquility. Once the pure essence has grown long, let it enter the Gate of Heaven. The Golden Chamber winds through the Central Pass; the Azure and White are distinct at the Mud Pill. Nurture the fluids, seal the essence, and unite body and spirit. The Three Palaces are fully defended, the Crimson Palace preserved. The Yellow Court and the earthly branches have no source of leakage; the five viscera and twelve wheels are thoroughly connected. Exhale and inhale the six bowels, and the hun and po rejoice. Repel the hundred ailments, ward off heat and cold. Preserve essence, retain life, and endure forever.’* This is what is called ‘summoning the Great Harmony, safeguarding the natural, and embracing the true essential Dao.’ If all people practice this, they will surely attain long life, command ghosts and spirits, and wander the Five Peaks—though they may not yet soar through the void. If you can achieve this, it will suffice to transcend the world. All who study immortality must begin here.\n\nAs for the supreme elixirs of the Most High, they are the wondrous treasures of the Celestial Emperor. The *xiayinsheng* and *chongyun* marvelous herbs are the medicines of the immortals. Those who obtain the highest grade will age only after Heaven and Earth, for these are consumed by the Most High—beyond the reach of lesser immortals. The next rank of medicines includes the Nine Elixirs: Golden Liquid, Purple Florescence, Rainbow Essence, Supreme Clarity, Ninefold Cyclic Transmutation, the Five Clouds’ Nectar, Mystic Frost and Crimson Snow, the Soaring Three Yellows, and Eastern Sea White Fragrance. There are also the Flying Life of the Dark Continent, the Eight Stones and Thousand Mushrooms, the Mighty Radiance of Nine Lights, the Western Flowing Stone Gall, the Eastern Azure Coin, the Remnant Grain of High Mounds, the Jade Fields of Accumulated Stones, the Celestial Return Elixir, the Golden Orchid vessel, the Everlasting Radiance herb, and the Flying Dryad of the Snow Lad. Those who consume these will ascend to heaven in broad daylight. These are the medicines of the flying immortals, unknown to earthbound immortals.\n\nThe lower-grade medicines include the fats of pine and *wutong*, *shanjiang*, *shenjing*, chrysanthemum blossoms, *zexie*, *gouqi*, *fuling*, *changpu*, *men* winter, *jusheng*, yellow essence, *lingfei*, red planks, peach resin, *muying*, *shengma*, *xuduan*, *weixi*, and *huanglian*. Such medicines, of which I have only begun to list, are countless in variety, numbering in the thousands. If you consume them, you may prolong your years. Though you may not achieve boundless longevity or ascend to the azure heavens, you can still restore the luster of youth, regain a childlike complexion, command legions of ghosts, and become an earthbound immortal.”",

Is this true? How diligent you are!\" On the seventh day of the seventh month, she came briefly to visit.",

      "translated_text": "Those who seek the Dao must first rely on this stepping-stone to gradually enter into its mysteries. If one can master breath, govern essence, and secure the spirit and qi—so that essence does not dissipate and qi remains ever-present—one may achieve permanence without death. This requires no expenditure on medicines or stones, nor the toil of seeking and gathering, for it is drawn from within the self. Yet the common people use it daily without awareness—this is the highest, most natural essential method.\n\nNow, the body of each person is endowed by Heaven with spirit, by Earth with form, and by the Dao with qi. Where qi abides, there is life; where qi departs, there is death—even plants and trees know this. Since the body takes the Dao as its root, how can one fail to nourish the spirit, secure the qi, and preserve the form? When form and spirit are both whole, the highest sages prize this above all. When form perishes and spirit flees, is it not grievous? Once this body is lost, it is difficult to recover even after ten thousand kalpas—cherish it well.\n\nWhat I have spoken are the words taught to me by my master, the Primordial Heavenly King. I now urge the Jade Maiden Li Qingsun to transcribe them and present them to the Emperor, saying: \"You must cultivate this diligently.\"\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West then ordered her carriage prepared to depart, but the Emperor rose from his seat, kowtowed, and begged her to stay. The Queen Mother commanded her attendants to summon the Supreme Primordial Lady to descend together to the Emperor’s palace. After a long while, the Supreme Primordial Lady arrived, and they sat once more to set out a celestial feast. Later, the Queen Mother instructed the Lady to bring forth the *Eight Assemblies Scripture*, the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, the *Five Emperors and Six Jia Spirit-Flight Talismans*, and twelve items in all, saying: \"This scripture is transmitted in Heaven only once every forty thousand kalpas. If it remains in the human realm, it may be passed to a worthy adept after forty years.\"\n\nThe Queen Mother then ordered her attendant Song Lingbin to open the cloud-brocade satchel and take out a volume to present to the Emperor. The Queen Mother held the book, stood, and handed it to him. She intoned:\n\n\"High is Heaven, low is Earth,\nTrue forms of the Five Peaks,\nPrimordial true qi surges,\nGreat marsh’s mysterious essence.\nHeaven revolves through nine paths,\nSix harmonies endure in peace,\nThe Supreme Eight Assemblies,\nAchieve flight to celestial realms.\nTrue immortals keep faith,\nThrough this they commune with spirits.\nLeaked, it falls to ruin’s depths—\nTreasure it for long life’s sake.\nHeed this well, I warn you, Liu.\"\n\nAfter the incantation, the Emperor bowed and received the book. The Queen Mother said: \"Those who first learn the Dao and receive talismans should separately offer sacrifices to the spirits of rivers and mountains, purify themselves in fasting, and wear them. After forty years, if you wish to transmit them to your friends, Dong Zhongjun and Li Shaojun may examine them. Moreover, as an emperor, you should diligently sacrifice to rivers and mountains to secure the state, and bestow these sacred texts upon the spirits to pacify the common people.\"\n\nHaving spoken, she and the Supreme Primordial Lady ordered their carriages to depart. Their attendants gathered, preparing to ascend to Heaven. The Queen Mother then smiled and pointed to Dongfang Shuo, saying: \"This is my neighbor’s mischievous child, ever fond of jesting—he has come thrice to steal my peaches. Once a celestial official under the Supreme, he was demoted to serve you after indulging in jade wine and losing harmony in his administration. He is no ordinary man.\"\n\nLater, Emperor Wu failed to heed the Queen Mother’s warnings, becoming ensnared by wine and women, ceaseless in warfare. He campaigned against Liaodong, struck at Chaoxian, opened routes to the southwestern barbarians, built terraces and pavilions, and launched grand construction projects. The realm grew resentful, and from then on, he lost the Dao. Though he later returned to Zhong, visited the Eastern Sea, and thrice sacrificed to the Queen Mother, she no longer descended. The book he had received was placed atop the Bailiang Terrace and consumed by heavenly fire. Li Shaojun departed by dissolving his form, while Dongfang Shuo flew away and did not return. The witchcraft affair arose, and the Emperor grew ever more remorseful. In the second year of the Yuanshi era, he died at the Five Blessings Palace and was buried at Maoling. Later, over fifty volumes of Daoist scriptures stored in Maoling emerged one day in the Baodu Mountains. A jade box and jade staff also appeared in Fufeng, and when taken to Maoling for verification, they remained unchanged. Yet how these objects came into the human world—and for what purpose—remains unknown.\n\nMaster Mao Ying, styled Shushen, followed the Lord of Western City to the White Jade Tortoise Terrace to pay homage to the Queen Mother and seek the Way of long life. He said: \"Though my body is unworthy, I yearn for the years of dragons and phoenixes; though my life is as fragile as a morning mushroom, I seek the span of countless moons.\"\n\nThe Queen Mother, moved by his earnestness, told him: \"I once studied under the Primordial Heavenly King and the Celestial Mulberry Emperor Lord, who taught me the Way of the Jade Girdle and Golden Pendants, the Two Radiant Bindings, ascending to the Great Ultimate, and descending to the Ten Directions. I bathed in moonlight and sipped sunlight to enter the Celestial Gate—this is called the *Scripture of Mysterious Truth*. I now transmit it to you; cultivate it diligently.\" She then urged the Lord of Western City to explain each detail and bestow it upon him.",

Later, Lord Mao retreated south to govern Mount Juqu.\n\nIn the second year of Emperor Yuan’s *Yuanshou* era, on the *jiyou* day of the eighth month, the Perfected of the Southern Marchmount, the Red Lord; the Lord of Western City; and the Azure Lad of Fangzhu all descended from the Queen Mother to Lord Mao’s chamber. Shortly after, the Celestial August Emperor dispatched the Embroidered-Robe Messenger, Ling Guangziqi, to confer upon Mao the divine seal and jade tally. The Lord of the Grand Tenuity sent the Left Palace Censor of the Three Heavens, Guan Xiutiao, to bestow upon him the *Eight-Dragon Brocade Palanquin* and the *Purple Feathered Robe of Splendor*. The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao sent the Harmonious Dawn Gentleman, Shi Shumen, to present him with the *True Talisman of the Golden Tiger*, the *Flowing Gold Bells*, and the *Golden Watchtower Saintly Lord* commanded the Perfected of the Great Ultimate to dispatch the Jade Gentleman of the Supreme Unity and Upper Mystery, Wang Zhong and Bao Qiu, to grant Mao the *Four-Season Swallow Embryo*, the *Flowing Brightness Divine Mushroom*.\n\nWhen the four messengers had finished their transmissions, they had Mao don the seal, robe, and talisman, adjust his cap and sash, and stand holding the bells. The four messengers then addressed Mao, saying:\n\n\"One who consumes the *Hidden Mushroom of the Four Seasons* shall be ranked as a Perfected Minister.\nOne who consumes the *Jade Mushroom of the Golden Watchtower* shall be ranked as Controller of Destinies.\nOne who consumes the *Flowing Brightness Golden Essence* shall be ranked as Controller of Emoluments.\nOne who consumes the *Double-Flying of Eternal Radiance* shall be ranked as Perfected Earl.\nOne who consumes the *Night-Glowing Cave Herb* shall preside over the duties of the Left and Right Censors.\nYou have consumed them all.

You are appointed as the Upper Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, governing the immortals of Wu and Yue, and overseeing the mountain sources of Jiangzuo.\"\n\nWhen they had finished speaking, the messengers all departed. The Lords of the Five Directions each descended to his courtyard in their directional chariots and regalia, transmitting the Celestial August Emperor’s command to bestow upon Mao the *Purple Jade Tablet*, the *Yellow Gold Inscribed Writ*, and the *Text of the Nine Bestowments*. He was then enfeoffed as the *Perfected Lord Controller of Destinies and Upper Minister of the Eastern Marchmount*, and the *Perfected of the Great Primordium*. When the investiture was complete, they all departed.\n\nThe Queen Mother and Mao’s master, the Lord of Western City, then prepared a celestial banquet for Mao. They feasted to their hearts’ content and sang the *Song of the Mysterious Numinous*. When the banquet concluded, the Queen Mother, accompanied by the Lord of Western City and Mao, visited Mao’s two younger brothers and imparted to each the essentials of the Dao.\n\nThe Queen Mother commanded the Lady of the Upper Prime to bestow upon Mao Gu and Mao Zhong the *Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean*, the *Scripture of Cinnabar Radiance*, and four other treasured scriptures. Holding the *Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean*, the Queen Mother ordered the handmaiden Zhang Lingzi to hold the *Pact of Mutual Trust* and present it to Mao, Gu, and Zhong. When the transmission was complete, the Queen Mother ascended to Heaven and departed.\n\nLater, Wang Bao, styled Zideng; Zhang Daoling, styled Fuhan; and the Nine Sages and Seven Perfected—all who had received the scriptures—paid homage to the Queen Mother at the Gate of Kunling.\n\nThereafter, the Lady of Purple Emptiness, Madame Wei Huacun, purified herself in retreat at the *Hidden Primordium Terrace* of Yangluo. The Queen Mother, together with the Saintly Lord of the Golden Watchtower, descended to the terrace in an *Eight-Scenery Cloud Chariot* and proceeded to the *Palace of Pure Emptiness*, where she transmitted the four-scroll *Hidden Writ of the Jade Clarity* to Huacun.

The Queen Mother then sang:\n\n\"I ride my *Eight-Scenery Chariot*,\nSerene, I enter the *Jade Clarity*.\nDragon banners brush the clouds above,\nTiger legions command the crimson hosts.\nCarefree at the edge of the Mystic Ford,\nTen thousand streams never pause for a moment.\nOnce this parting and reunion is done,\nWhen kalpas end and Heaven and Earth collapse,\nSeek the scene within the Non-Being,\nNeither death nor life shall bind you.\nEmbody the Dao of spontaneity,\nIn silent contemplation merge with the Great Obscurity.\nThe Southern Marchmount nurtures the true trunk,\nJade’s radiance gleams with luminous essence.\nIn office, be free of its burdens,\nWith an empty heart, naturally receive the numinous.\nA joyous gathering at the bend of the Crimson River,\nTogether we delight without end.\"\n\nWhen she finished singing, the Lady of the Upper Prime responded with her own song. Then the Queen Mother, the Lady of the Upper Prime, the Left Immortal Duke of Purple Yang, the Immortal Earl of the Great Ultimate, and the Perfected Lord of Pure Emptiness took the Southern Marchmount’s Wei Huacun with them as they traveled southeast to the Jade Palace beneath the Cavernous Palace of Mount Huo on Tiantai. All the Perfected followed the Queen Mother as she ascended and returned to Tortoise Terrace.\n\nThe Queen Mother is the preceptor of the myriad kinds, the overseer of the host of Perfected. Her sacred rank is most exalted, and she governs both the hidden and the manifest. Thus, when the Dark Cavern’s Xuan Gong sought the Dao, he received it in audience, and when Xie Ziranjing attended her to ascend as an immortal, the *Transmission of the Dark Cavern* and the *Transmission of Ziran* both call the Golden Mother their teacher.

      "translated_text": "Nine Heavens Mystic Maiden\n\nThe Nine Heavens Mystic Maiden was the teacher of the Yellow Emperor and a disciple of the Primordial Sovereign Saintly Mother. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor ruled the state of Youxiong, assisting Yugang, grandson of Shennong. As the latter’s power waned, the feudal lords turned to warfare, their weapons clashing endlessly. Each claimed dominion over a cardinal direction and styled themselves after the Five Phases: the descendants of Taihao proclaimed themselves the Bluegreen Emperor; the lineage of Yugang, grandson of Shennong, called themselves the Red Emperor; the clan of Gonggong named themselves the White Emperor; the heirs of Getian declared themselves the Black Emperor. The Emperor, rising from the lands of Youxiong, took the title of Yellow Emperor.\n\nHe governed with humility, honoring the worthy and cultivating virtue. After twenty-one years on the throne, Chiyou wrought havoc—his eighty-one brothers, beast-bodied and human-tongued, with copper heads and iron brows, devoured sand and swallowed stones, refusing to till the five grains. They devised the Five Cruelties to torment the common folk, forged weapons on Mount Gelu, and defied the Emperor’s commands. Resolved to subdue them, the Emperor sought the wise and capable to aid him. He found Fengtai by the sea, Limu in the great marsh, appointed Dahong as his assistant, and Tianlao as his teacher. He established the Three Dukes to mirror the Three Terraces: Fenghou as the Upper Terrace, Tianlao as the Middle Terrace, and the Five Sages as the Lower Terrace. He then obtained a sacred tripod that cooked without fire. Following the solar cycles, he enfeoffed Hu as general and named Lady Feixiu’s son as crown prince. With ministers such as Zhang Ruoyangpeng, Limu, Rongguang, Longxing, Cangjie, Rongcheng, Danao, and Shelong as his wings, he marched against Chiyou at Zhuolu. Yet the Emperor’s forces could not prevail.\n\nChiyou conjured a three-day fog, shrouding all in disorientation. Fenghou, emulating the Dipper’s mechanism, crafted a great chariot with a ladle pointing south to orient the four directions. The Emperor, grieving and indignant, fasted at the foot of Mount Tai. The Queen Mother dispatched an envoy clad in a black fox-fur robe, presenting him with a talisman and instructing: “Concentrate your spirit and petition Heaven—there shall be a response from the Supreme.” Days later, amid a vast, lightless fog, the Mystic Maiden descended. Riding a cinnabar phoenix and wreathed in radiant clouds, she wore a nine-hued robe of kingfisher plumes. Alighting before the Emperor, he bowed twice and received her command. She declared: “I transmit the teachings of the Supreme. Ask what you will.”\n\nThe Emperor prostrated himself and said: “Chiyou’s tyranny poisons the people; the Four Seas cry out, their lives unprotected. I seek a strategy to ensure victory in a single battle, to rid the world of this scourge. Is this possible?”\n\nThe Mystic Maiden then bestowed upon him the Six Jia and Six Ren military talismans, the *Book of the Five Numinous Talismans for Commanding Ghosts and Spirits*, the *Five Luminous Seals for Subduing Demons and Communing with Spirits*, the *Formulae of the Five Yin and Five Yang Escape Arts*, the *Diagram of the Supreme Unity’s Ten Essences and Four Spirits for Grasping Victory*, the *Oracle of the Five Peaks and River Chart’s Essence*, the *Nine Radiant Jade Tallies and Ten Absolute Spirit Cords*, the *Sword for Commanding Demons*, the *Mist Crown and Flame Girdle*, the *Dragon Halberd and Rainbow Banner*, the *Kingfisher Canopy and Green Plow*, the *Tiger Cavalry and Thousand-Flower Canopy*, the *Eight-Phoenix Chariot*, the *Feathered Key and Mystic Pole*, the *Rainbow Standard and Jade Chime*, and other divine artifacts: the *Five Dragons’ Seal*, the *Nine Luminous Pearls*, and the *Nine Heavens’ Tallies*.

      "translated_text": "The Emperor subdued them all, vanquishing Chiyou upon the wilds of Absolute Rein and the lands of Central Ji. His limbs were severed and buried in four separate mounds. Thereafter, Yu Gang defied the Mandate, and the Emperor slew him upon the plains of Banquan. He drove the Xunzhai northward, pacifying the Four Directions, traversing the Four Poles—a journey of twenty-eight thousand li—before casting the Nine Tripods and establishing the Nine Provinces. He appointed ministers of the Nine Ranks and Nine Virtues to observe the heavens and earth, to sacrifice to the hundred spirits, and to promulgate laws and teachings. Then, gathering copper from Mount Shou, he cast the tripods beneath Mount Xing. A yellow dragon descended to receive him, and the Emperor ascended to heaven upon its back. All this was achieved through the talismans, strategies, and diagrams bestowed by the Mysterious Woman to aid his great enterprise.\n\nIn ancient times, the Shu region had the Silkworm Ancestor, Can Cong. During the reign of Gao Xin, there lived in Shu a Silkworm Maiden, whose surname is unknown. Her father was carried off by raiders, leaving only his horse behind. Grieving for her father, the maiden refused to eat, and her mother swore before all: \"Whoever brings my husband home shall have this daughter in marriage.\" Hearing these words, the horse reared in astonishment, broke free of its bonds, and galloped away. Days later, the father returned, riding the very same horse. From that day, the horse neighed incessantly and would not be stilled. The mother recounted her vow to the father, who replied: \"A vow made to men cannot bind a beast. How could a human wed one of another kind? Though it saved me from peril, its deed was great, the oath cannot be fulfilled.\" The horse continued to prance wildly, and in anger, the father slew it, flaying its hide and drying it in the courtyard. Suddenly, the hide leapt up, wrapped the maiden within it, and flew away. Ten days later, the hide came to rest upon a mulberry tree, and the maiden transformed into a silkworm, feeding on the leaves and spinning cocoons to clothe mankind. One day, the Silkworm Maiden descended upon clouds, riding that very horse, attended by thousands of guards. She spoke to her parents: \"The Supreme One, seeing my heart unwavering in righteousness, has granted me the rank of Celestial Consort of the Nine Palaces. Do not grieve for me.\" Her tomb now lies at the border of three counties—Shiyu, Deyang, and Han Prefecture—where each year, those who pray for silkworms gather from all directions. In Shu’s customs, temples and shrines sculpt her image draped in horsehide, calling her the Horse-Head Maiden, to invoke blessings for sericulture.\n\nThe *Rites of Zhou*, in the *Offices of Summer*, states that the Horse Assessor oversees horse transactions and adjudicates disputes, forbidding the raising of \"original silkworms.\" Zheng Xuan’s commentary explains: \"Original means second. The celestial sign of Chen governs horses; the *Silkworm Book* says silkworms are the essence of dragons. When the moon aligns with the Great Fire, their eggs are bathed. Thus, silkworms and horses share the same qi, and things cannot both be great. The prohibition on second silkworms is to avoid harming horses.\" From this discourse, the affinity between silkworms and horses is evident, and there must be those in the world who delve deeply into its principles.

      "translated_text": "When Yu of Xia governed the waters, dredging rivers along the mountains, the Venerable Lord dispatched Cloud Radiance Lady to assist him in secret. At the time, Yu had stationed himself beneath Mount Wu, when a great wind suddenly arose, shaking cliffs and valleys, its force uncontrollable. Suddenly, he encountered Cloud Radiance Lady, and Yu bowed, seeking her aid. The Lady then compelled her attendants to bestow upon Yu the *Book of Summoning Ghosts and Spirits*, and commanded her divine ministers—Kuang Zhang, Yu Yu, Huang Hui, Da Yi, Geng Chen, Tong Lü, and the Giant Spirit—to assist him in hewing stone, dredging waves, blocking torrents, and guiding currents.\n\nYu once paid homage to Cloud Radiance atop the summit of Chong Sou. In the blink of an eye, she transformed into stone. At times, she would suddenly soar aloft, scattering into wispy clouds, then gently coalescing into evening rain. Now a roving dragon, now a soaring crane, her thousand forms and myriad shapes defied approach. Yu suspected her of cunning trickery, deeming her no true immortal. He inquired of Tong Lü, who replied: \"The root of Heaven and Earth is the Dao; the function of the Dao is wielded by the sage. Among the ranks of sages are Perfected Ones and Immortals. Some, endowed with primordial qi, attain the Dao without cultivation—such are Wood Lord and Metal Mother, the progenitors of the Two Qi, the origin of yin and yang, the sovereigns of the immortals, and the primal source of creation. Cloud Radiance Lady is the daughter of Metal Mother. *The Marvelous Records of the Immortals* states her name is Yao Ji. She received scriptures and became Lady of the Upper Palace of Cloud Radiance, presiding over the instruction of youthful Perfected Ones. Her abode is the Terrace of Jade Reflection, where her transformations in concealment and manifestation are her constant nature. For she coalesced from congealed qi, uniting with the Dao in form—not born of womb or endowed with mortal transformation, but the qi of the Lesser Yin of Western Radiance. Moreover, qi pervades Heaven and Earth, animating the animate and inanimate, encompassing creation in its vastness, penetrating even the finest hair. In man, it is man; in things, it is things. How could it be confined to clouds and rain, dragons and cranes, soaring geese or ascending phoenixes?\"\n\nYu was convinced and sought her again. Suddenly, he beheld a terrace of cloud and jade, its jasper towers resplendent, with spirit-officials standing guard, their forms beyond naming. Lions held the gates, celestial steeds cleared the path, venomous dragons and lightning beasts arrayed in eightfold majesty before her chariot. The Lady sat in repose upon the jasper terrace. Yu prostrated himself and inquired of the Dao. She summoned him to sit and said: \"When the sagely artisan first arose, he split the great undifferentiated simplicity into countless forms, unfurled the vast storehouse’s single bud into boundless things. Thus, he paced the Three Luminaries to establish the sundial’s shadow, demarcated the Nine Regions to govern states and kingdoms, carved clepsydrae to divide day and night, used cold and heat to fix the year’s reckoning, aligned kan and li to rectify the cardinal directions, separated mountains and rivers into yin and yang, gathered the people within city walls, forged weapons to defend the multitude, fashioned carriages and robes to distinguish noble and base, and cultivated millet to prepare for famine. All these institutions draw their pattern from above from the stars and constellations, and from below take their model from the divine Perfected. Thus, the sun and moon have their obscurity and brightness, life and death follow cold and heat, thunder and lightning have their times of emergence and retreat, wind and rain their rhythms of movement and stillness. Kindred qi floats above, while manifold essences scatter below. The cycles of rise and fall, the turns of order and chaos, the natures of worthy and foolish, the dispositions of good and evil, the qi of firmness and softness, the fates of long and short life, the stations of noble and base, the ranks of high and low, the omens of fortune and misfortune, the junctures of success and failure—all these are endowed by the Dao, suspended from Heaven, and made manifest by the sage.\n\n\"Nature arises from Heaven, but destiny is fulfilled by man. Heaven establishes it; the Dao enacts it. Where the Dao abides, there is being; where it departs, there is nothing. Without the Dao, things cannot endure. Without cultivation, the Dao cannot be attained. The Most High has said: 'Attain utmost emptiness, preserve profound stillness, and the myriad things will revert of themselves.' To revert is to return to the Dao, to abide perpetually. The function of the Dao is inexhaustible in its ten thousand transformations. Thus, Heaven partakes of the Threefold Mystery, Earth of the Primal Yellow, and man of virtue and power. Beyond these, there is no Dao.\n\n\"The essentials of longevity are these: Heaven preserves its mystery, Earth guards its things, and man nurtures his qi—thus is wholeness maintained. Then my life is in my own hands; neither Heaven and Earth slay me, nor ghosts and spirits harm me, but I lose the Dao and perish of myself. Be steadfast! Be diligent! Your merit extends to all things, your toil reaches even me, your virtue moves Heaven—yet you have not heard the Supreme Dao.\n\n\"Long ago, at the Purple Clarity Gate, I received scriptures and treasured them with diligence. My master, the Three Primordials Lord of the Dao, said: 'The *Inner Scripture of the Supreme Perfected* is the treasure of the Heavenly Perfected. Seal it in a golden terrace, wear it at the Great Tenuity, and clouds will convey you upward while divine tigers guard the gates. Shake out your robes in the jasper chamber, roam and feast in the rare groves, ever summoning the Immortal Lords. On the right, dwell upon White Mountain and gaze down upon the Great Void. Drift upon the Celestial Ford, riding clouds and driving dragons; wander these famous mountains, and the Perfected will visit your chamber. Ten thousand spirits attend you, a thousand essences welcome you. In motion, you ride the Eight Radiance Jade Chariot; in stillness, you repose in the Golden Hall.' This is also called the wondrous scripture of the *Jade Girdle and Golden Pendant of the Most High*.\n\n\"You seek to cross vast seas without a swift vessel, traverse flying sands without a cloud-borne chariot, tread treacherous paths without a carriage, ford muddy waves without a boat. On land, you will be wearied by distant barriers; on water, you will fear drifting and sinking. Yet you would guide the hundred valleys and dredge the myriad rivers—how perilous and distant is your task! The Most High pities your utmost devotion and will bestow upon you the *Numinous Treasure True Writ*, to command tigers and leopards on land, subdue dragons in water, sever the roots of myriad evils, restrain the multitude of malevolence, and accomplish your work. This lies within the Heaven of Yang Brightness.\n\n\"The precious scripture I bestow can also enable you to enter and exit fire and water, roar and summon the netherworld, command tigers and leopards, call forth the Six Dings, conceal yourself in the Eight Earths, invert the Five Stars, prolong vision and preserve the body, and align with Heaven and Earth in duration.\"",

She further ordered the gods Kuang Zhang and Ju Ling, among others, to assist Yu in slaying those who harmed the people—beings beyond mortal strength to subdue. The execution of Fangfeng at Kuaiji and the shackling of Wuzhiqi, the spirit of the Huai and Wo rivers, beneath Tortoise Mountain were among their feats.

The Weaving Maiden corresponds to the celestial asterism above, while the Herdboy is the River Drum. An old account tells that the Celestial River connects with the sea: in the Han era, a man dwelling by the sea would see rafts floating to and fro each eighth month, never failing their appointed time. A man of extraordinary ambition built a flying pavilion atop one, stocked ample provisions, and rode the raft away. After more than ten days, he reached a place with walled cities and well-ordered houses. Gazing afar into a chamber, he saw a woman weaving. Another man appeared, leading an ox to drink. Startled, they asked, “How have you come here?” The traveler explained his purpose, then inquired, “What is this place?” They replied, “Go to Shu Commandery and seek Yan Junping—he will know.” Upon his return, he asked Junping, who said, “On such-and-such a day of such-and-such a year, a guest star trespassed upon the Herdboy asterism. By my reckoning, that was precisely when you reached the Celestial River.”\n\nThe *Divine Marvels of Dongfang Shuo* records: Guo Han once encountered the Weaving Maiden descending into his chamber. She wore a gown of dark auroral silk and a cloak of frost-spun gauze, a golden crown with phoenix plumes, and slippers embroidered with ninefold jade patterns. She unfurled a canopy of cinnabar mist and cinnabar valley, spread a mat of ninefold crystalline jade, turned a fan of converging winds, and rested upon a pillow of entwined dragons. The next day, she inscribed a strip of azure silk with cinnabar and lead, leaving it for Han.\n\nThe *Book of Han* states: Dong Yong lost his mother in youth.

      "translated_text": "Li Zhenduo followed her brother in cultivating the Dao, dwelling in the bamboo groves of Mianzhu. The Lord Lao and the Three Masters of Remote Antiquity descended to transmit to her the Way of Ascension, and she preceded her brother by ascending to heaven in broad daylight. Her ancient traces remain to this day. Sometimes she comes and goes by the side of Mount Fu, now called the Transformation of Zhenduo—this was once the ancient seat of governance at Mount Fu. Another account states that the Eight Hundred once came with his sister Zhenduo to divine a dwelling at Wulong Ridge in Yunyang, also called Red Shang Stockade, which is now the prefectural seat of Ruizhou. They later refined the elixir in a stone chamber on Mount Hualin, now the Floating Cloud Abbey in Fengxin County, Longxing Prefecture. Though the brother and sister were both from Shu, even after settling in Yunyang, they frequently traveled back to Shu. One day, Zhenduo arrived from Shu, and the Eight Hundred awaited her—this is now the Gate of Gazing for Immortals in Ruizhou. Seeing Zhenduo holding a lotus flower and appearing pregnant, the Eight Hundred grew furious and intended to draw his sword and strike her. Sensing his intent, Zhenduo suddenly soared into the air and crossed the river, where she gave birth to a child and a scroll of scripture. Then, riding the cloud-qi, she slowly ascended to heaven. The people of the time sculpted an image of Zhenduo to enshrine and worship her. When the statue was completed, it would not move. That night, Zhenduo appeared in a dream, saying: \"My shrine should be on Wulong Ridge.\" The next day, the statue became remarkably light, and so they enshrined it there. In the tenth year of the Tianbao era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the Heavenly Master Sun Zhidong first memorialized to rename it Yuanyang Abbey, to manifest its sacred traces. In the seventh year of the Yuanhe era of Emperor Xianzong, the magistrate of Gao’an County, Shen Ben, exchanged the county seat with the abbey’s grounds. Today, two *li* west of Ruizhou city, on Xiaoyao Mountain, stands Miaozhen Abbey. The place where she gave birth to the scripture is now called Yitian Abbey. Within the abbey, female immortals have transmitted her scripture through the generations. The people of the prefecture, whenever preparing incense offerings, visit the abbey to view the scripture, seeking protection from difficult births. Zhenduo is now titled the Radiant Incense Primordial Sovereign.\n\n**Ying Nü**\nYing, the daughter of Duke Mu of Qin, was named Nongyu. Skilled in playing the *sheng*, she had no equal and wished to find a match who could play alongside her. There was a man named Xiao Shi, who excelled at playing the *xiao* and could summon the clear wind, colored clouds, and phoenixes. Nongyu desired to marry him. When she played the *sheng*, it was as if she, too, could summon what Xiao Shi did. Thus, Mengming served as the matchmaker and Saisu as the master of ceremonies, and the marriage was arranged. They feasted in the Western Palace, where no other music was performed—only the two of them played the *sheng* and *xiao* in alternation, eventually summoning phoenixes to alight. The two then rode them away.

Her parents reproached her, yet she refused to speak of it, and only her handmaid knew the truth. One day, she said to her handmaid, \"When I die, you must cut open my belly to prove my innocence.\" That very night, she passed away. Her parents, not defying her words, opened her abdomen and found an object resembling a lotus in first bloom, within which lay ten scrolls of white silk inscribed with golden script—the *Benji Jing*. Over ten days later, a great storm arose with darkness and gloom, and the scriptures vanished.\n\nThe *Record of Chengdu* states: The Celestial Master’s great-granddaughter conceived without a husband, and her father suspected her, intending to kill her. After she gave birth, a strange light appeared, revealing a scroll—the *Benji Jing*. Her father, deeming it divine, cast aside his blade. Later, she ascended to immortality at Dunxin Village, where the Lady’s Temple now stands. To this day, the Sacred Maiden’s Terrace, the Blade-Discarding Pool, and the Scripture-Washing Pool remain. Another account says she obtained ten scrolls of the *Benji Jing* written on white silk with golden script, each scroll over two feet long and six or seven inches wide, the characters radiant and wondrous, seemingly not of human craft. The scriptures were copied and buried with Yulan. Over a hundred days later, a great storm with thunder and rain arose, and both the scriptures and Yulan disappeared.

      "translated_text": "A month or so later, she again passed through the market and suddenly saw a child of about three, weeping and wailing, no one knowing whose son he was. When he encountered Chen the Matron, he clutched her robe and would not let go, pleading, \"Where has my mother come from? I beg your pity.\" Taking pity on his helplessness, Chen the Matron took him in and raised him. As he grew, he served her with sweet delicacies, never failing in his morning and evening duties. His heart merged with the Dao, and his conduct reached the gods. His wisdom surpassed others, and he mastered the classics and histories. He delved into astronomy, geography, the Hundred Schools, and the Nine Streams, exhausting the mysteries of things and probing the subtle and profound.\n\nWhen he neared twenty, the Matron said to him, \"I have long cultivated and followed the true Dao. You were raised by me, and this bond is but temporary. Since you have no heavenly origin, what surname will you take?\" The youth replied, \"Once, the Heavenly Perfected bestowed upon me a sacred writ, appointing me as the Filial and Fraternal Luminous King. May I take this as my name?\" The Matron said, \"Since the Heavenly Perfected has entrusted this to you, how dare I oppose it?\"\n\nThey then discussed marriage, but the youth knelt before the Matron and recited a hymn: \"I am no mortal of this world, but a lofty immortal of the upper realms. Now as your son, this is but an old bond from past lives. Through this, I fulfill the Way of filial piety and deliver all divine immortals. The fifteen youths before me were also my transformed bodies. Now that my Dao and qi are complete, I shall return to my true form. The true and the mundane follow different paths—why discuss marriage? Rather, let us at the Huang Hall altar transmit the teaching to a worthy one. Once you have spread my teaching, my spirit shall dwell in the Three Clarities.\"\n\nHearing this hymn, Chen the Matron was filled with awe and reverence. She then established an altar at Huang Hall, reverently maintaining its incense and flame, and widely propagated the teaching of the Filial and Fraternal Luminous King. The Luminous King instructed the Matron in the secrets of cultivating the true Dao: \"Always ascend to a lofty and secluded altar, sever ties with heterodox factions, steal moments on hills and mounds, ingest the warmth of yang, entrust your mirror to the great void, and still your mind in the mystic garden. Without the Wuying Precious Canopy, the Yellow Elder’s Jade Writ, the Great Cavern Scripture, or the Supreme Hidden Dao of the Seven Radiant Ones of the Vast Expanse, one cannot recline in the chariot of drifting rosy clouds or gaze upon the Terrace of Literary Florescence. Those who attain this Dao will hear the nine phoenixes sing in unison, their myriad cries ceasing only when perfection is reached. They refine the body and master the nodes, the Eight Effulgences float in the void, and dragon chariots with tiger escorts roam the eight directions. Treasure this always.\"\n\nThereupon, she received the wondrous secrets and was also bestowed the sacred writ. Soon after, he bid farewell to his mother and soared into the heavens. Chen the Matron safeguarded and concealed what she had received, and for decades, no one knew of it. By the end of the Western Jin, Xu the Perfected Jun Xun and Wu the Perfected Jun Meng, having heard of the Matron’s attainment of the Dao, journeyed from afar to Danyang to seek her teachings. Knowing their names were recorded in the celestial registers and that they were destined to become immortals, she transmitted to them the teaching of the Filial and Fraternal Luminous King, the lineage of ascending immortals, the Orthodox Unity method for slaying demons, and the art of the Three and Five Flying Steps. She also passed on the bronze talisman and iron charter of the Filial and Fraternal Luminous King, the Golden Elixir Scripture, and the Jade Writs of the Jade Emperor’s celestial registers, all in strict accordance with the original precepts, entrusting them to Master Xu. She further instructed the two Perfected Ones on the ranks of immortals and the hierarchy of divine implements, then commanded Master Xu to transmit the Dao to Master Wu.\n\nThe two Perfected Ones bowed in gratitude and prepared to take their leave. Master Xu wished to pay his respects to the Matron each year, but she stopped him, saying, \"Do not come. I shall soon return to the Emperor’s realm.\" She then took a blade of fragrant grass, faced south, and cast it into the wind, where it flew away. She said, \"When you return, go several dozen *li* south of your dwelling and find where the grass has fallen. There, establish a shrine for me. Visiting once each autumn will suffice.\" As she finished speaking, a cloud-dragon chariot descended to welcome her, and she ascended into the heavens.\n\nToday, at the border of Xinjian and Fengcheng counties, stands the Huang Hall Abbey, built by the Perfected Ones where they sought the Matron in Danyang’s Huang Hall.

When the Perfected One went to visit, she had already ascended in flight, leaving behind a treasure of a wooden flower-chariot. The chariot rose with the wind and descended after three days, so the abbey was named Flower-Chariot Abbey. Its stele still stands, and it is now called Radiant Cloud Abbey.\n\n**Matron Xu**\nMatron Xu was the elder sister of the Perfected One Xu Xun and the mother of Xu XuLie. As she was widowed, Xu Xun built a chamber for her several dozen paces west of his dwelling, where she resided. While Xu Xun cultivated the Dao in Western Mountain, delving into the profound mysteries day and night, Matron Xu and her son XuLie daily partook of its wonders. Whenever Xu Xun went out, Matron Xu managed his household affairs, and all immortal guests and reclusive visitors were received by her. On the day Xu Xun ascended in flight, Matron Xu and her son XuLie, along with their entire immortal household, received the Jade Emperor’s decree and ascended to heaven.\n\n**The Xu Clan**\nThe Xu clan was the daughter of the Perfected Lord Xu Xun. She married Huang Renlan of Jian’an and fully mastered the Perfected Lord’s Daoist mysteries. Daily she studied the arts of divine transcendence. When Huang Renlan took office as an attendant in Qingzhou, he left Xu behind to serve her parents-in-law. One evening, a servant reported hearing voices and laughter in Xu’s courtyard at night. Her mother-in-law questioned her, and Xu replied, “It was Huanglang.” Her mother-in-law said, “Your husband is thousands of *li* away in office—how could he be here?” Xu said, “He has attained the Dao of immortals and can traverse a thousand *li* in an instant. I was warned against revealing this, so I dared not tell you.” Her mother-in-law said, “If so, let me see him.” That evening, Renlan returned, and Xu told him what had transpired. By dawn, Renlan could no longer conceal it and came forth to greet his parents, saying, “Though I serve in a distant land, I secretly return each night to your side. The Dao of immortals must remain secret, lest I incur punishment and bring you harm.” With that, he took a bamboo staff, transformed it into a green dragon, and rode away. Later, on the day the Perfected Lord Xu Xun ascended lightly into the heavens, Xu, Renlan, and thirty-two members of their household rose into the sky in broad daylight. As the immortal procession departed, a hairpin of Xu’s fell to the earth; the place is now called Xu’s Fallen Hairpin Shoal.\n\n**Master Alchemist Xue**\nThe female immortal Master Alchemist Xue’s origins are unknown. In the Jin dynasty, the world was in turmoil, and the capital was unsettled. Those of the Dao often dwelled in mountains and forests to avoid the world. She resided at Seeking the True Terrace on Southern Marchmount, outwardly mingling with the mundane while inwardly cultivating the utmost Dao. She often rode a white leopard to wander the peaks of Qikuo, with yellow birds and white apes never leaving her side. Later, at Cloud Dragon Peak, she achieved *shijie* and left behind *Immortal Tales: A Supplemental Record*. The *Records of the Xiang Region* state: “The place where the Jin female immortal Master Alchemist Xue ascended is where Emperor Wu of Liang built an abbey in the fifth year of the Tianjian era.” As for the later Zhou Princess Hui, daughter of the Martial Duke of Zhou, she was born with a radiant light filling the room. From childhood, she ate no meat, and as she grew, she longed for solitude, admiring the aspirations of Lady Wei and the Monkey Immortal Maiden. She dwelled in a stone chamber, where the Western Numinous Holy Mother descended to transmit scriptures and records, and she cultivated the Dao of the Three Primes.

In the early years of the Kaiyuan era under Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the abbey was bestowed the plaque *Western Numinosity*. Thereafter, the Daoist nuns Li Taireal and Cao Miaoben successively attained the Dao, and the abbey that stands today was originally donated by the Zhou Princess. After falling into disrepair, it was revived by the Ma family.

Having attained immortality and entered the celestial registers since the most ancient times, she ranked below the Queen Mother of the Golden Terrace. Wherever the Golden Mother descended, she often sent her attendant maidens to accompany her, inviting the Lady as a guest and companion.\n\nEmperor Wu of Han, devoted to the Dao of divine transcendents, offered prayers and sacrifices at renowned mountains to seek spiritual responses. In the first year of the Yuanfeng era, on the seventh day of the seventh month, during the second watch of the night, the Queen Mother of the West descended to the Han palace. The Emperor received her with prostrations and remained standing in attendance for a long while. The Queen Mother bade him sit and presented him with celestial delicacies. After the feast, she prepared to depart. The Emperor descended from his seat, kowtowed, and earnestly entreated her to stay. The Queen Mother resumed her seat and commanded her attendant, Guo Mixiang, to invite the Lady of Primordial Yang to join the banquet in the Han palace—a record of which appears in *The Transmission of the Queen Mother of the Golden Lord*.\n\nIn the fourth year of the Dijie era of Emperor Xuan of Han, Mao Ying of Xianyang received the Ninefold Bestowal of Yellow Gold and was appointed Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, True Lord of Life and Destiny, and Perfected of the Great Prime. At that time, the Five Thearchs had already conferred their decrees and ascended to heaven. The Master of Mao Ying, the Venerable Lord of Total Perfection, along with the Queen Mother of the West and the Lady of Primordial Yang, descended to the Golden Altar of the Hua Yang Heavenly Palace on Mount Juqu, where they held a feast in honor of Mao Ying. Present were Mao Ying’s brothers, Mao Gu (styled the Middle Lord) and Mao Zhong (styled the Lesser Lord). The Queen Mother and the Venerable Lord bestowed upon them sacred instructions and likewise granted them the Ninefold Bestowal. The splendor of the Purple Simplicity ensured Mao Gu’s name in the Register of Destiny. Mao Zhong was appointed Lord of Life Preservation and also attended the assembly of perfected beings.\n\nThe Venerable Lord addressed the two Lords, saying: “The Lady is the Mother of the Three Heavenly Perfected August Ones, the exalted sovereign of Primordial Yang, and overseer of the registers of jade maidens throughout the ten directions. You may present yourselves before her.” The two Lords descended from their seats, bowed twice, and entreated her for the essentials of longevity. Moved by their earnest devotion, the Lady commanded her attendant, Song Bifei, to bring forth a purple brocade satchel. Opening the green-gold clasp, she presented them with four scriptures: *The Scripture of Flowing Pearls of the Three Primes*, *The Scripture of the Essence of the Dao of Cinnabar Scenery*, *The Scripture of the Eight Arts of the Hidden Immortals*, and *The Scripture of the Record of the Supreme Ultimate*.\n\nThe Queen Mother then instructed Li Fangming of the Special Realm to bring forth a cinnabar-jade casket. Opening the cloud-pearl clasp, she revealed *The Scripture of the Jade Pendant and Golden Circlet*, *The Scripture of the Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean*, and *The Inner Writ of the Two Sceneries of Cavern Flight*, which she transmitted to the two Lords. After receiving the texts, the Queen Mother and the Lady took their leave. With a retinue of a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, they ascended back to the Great Void.",

She governed the Palace of Great Cinnabar and, having received the scriptures, became the Sacred Lord of the Golden Watchtower, Supreme Guardian of Destiny. During the reign of Emperor Ping of Han, she descended into the stone chamber of Mount Yangluo and transmitted thirty scrolls, including *The Treasured Writ of the Supreme Void* and other scriptures, to the Lord of Pristine Emptiness. The Lady wore a brocade cloak and kingfisher-feather skirt, with a tiger-script talisman at her left and a spirit-summoning seal at her right. Though appearing no older than sixteen or seventeen, her form was flawless, her celestial grace veiled in mist. She rode a feathered treasure chariot drawn by nine dragons, attended by nine thousand female riders. Dwelling in the Longli Mountains amid the Bo Sea of Yangzhou, she presided over the instruction of those destined to become Perfected Ones.\n\nThe Lady of Right Radiance\n\nThe Lady of Right Radiance was the thirteenth daughter of the Queen Mother of the West, named Meilan, styled Shenlin—*The Comprehensive Record of Marvelous Immortals* calls her Zhonglin. She governed Mount Canglang and, having received the scriptures, became the Lady of Cloud Forests.

In times past, she descended to transmit *The Scripture of Treasured Spirits* to the Perfected One of Pristine Spirit, Pei, whose cultivation of its teachings led to transcendence. In the sixth month of the yichou year of the third year of the Xingning era of Emperor Ai of Jin, she descended upon Mount Gouqu alongside the Pacifying Consort of Nine Blossoms, twenty-three Perfected Ones, and fifteen female immortals, imparting the Dao to the Perfected One Yang Xi.

The Lady occasionally journeyed to Mount Daizong, where towering cliffs and layered crags formed deep recesses, inaccessible to mortals, rising over a thousand *zhang* above the earth. Within lay jade tables and golden groves, rare treasures of marvelous magnificence. Each time she plucked the strings of her zither, a hundred birds would gather in flight, dancing to her music.

      "translated_text": "Ma Gu was the younger sister of Wang Fangping, having attained transcendence through the cultivation of the Dao. She appeared to be around eighteen years old, her hair coiled atop her head with the rest cascading down to her waist. Her garments bore intricate patterns, their radiance outshining the sun—such finery was unseen in the mortal world. According to the Daoist scriptures: the Venerable Lord surveyed the boundless realms, witnessing the three disasters, nine calamities, ten perils, and eight tribulations, and revealed the methods to avert them. Among these texts, there are passages dispatching the Black Riders of the North, the celestial hosts, the aged Ma Gu, and five hundred million riders. Thus, it is known that Ma Gu, a high immortal of the great kalpas, has long responded to the turning of the ages.\n\nOnce, when Fangping descended to the home of Cai Jing, he sent a messenger to invite Ma Gu to join the feast. Each prepared their own celestial repast, served on golden platters and jade cups. The delicacies were mostly composed of various flowers, their fragrance permeating both within and without. The sliced unicorn jerky resembled roasted cypress, and the celestial wine poured like ambrosia. Ma Gu remarked: \"Since I began attending to such gatherings, I have witnessed the Eastern Sea transform into mulberry fields three times. When I recently visited Penglai, the waters were shallower than before—perhaps half have already receded, and soon dust will rise again.\"\n\nMa Gu’s fingernails resembled those of a bird’s talons. Cai Jing thought to himself: \"If only I could use these claws to scratch my back, it would be most delightful.\" Fangping, already aware of Jing’s thoughts, immediately ordered a divine officer to flog him, saying: \"Ma Gu is a divine being—how dare you entertain such improper notions!\"\n\nIn Xuanzhou, there stands the Altar of Ma Gu the Immortal; in Jianchang Prefecture, there is Mount Ma Gu. Manifestations of her numinous presence are not confined to a single place. During the *Zhenghe* era of Emperor Huizong of Song, she was honored with the title \"Perfected Sovereign of True Quiescence and Responsive Potency.\" In the *Jiatai* era of Emperor Ningzong, her title was changed to \"Perfected Person of Void Quiescence and Responsive Potency.\"\n\n**Princess of Nanyang**\nDuring the Han dynasty, the Princess of Nanyang married Wang Xian. When Wang Mang usurped power, the princess, who had long admired purity and revered the supreme Dao, often reflected on the governance of Emperors Wen and Jing. Knowing that divine immortals had repeatedly descended during the reign of Emperor Wu, she said to Xian: \"The nation is in peril, and the world is in chaos—this is no time for a woman to offer support. You must preserve your tranquility, withdraw to cultivate the Dao, and distance yourself from the mundane realm to prolong your years. If you blindly follow the times, advancing and retreating with the world, I fear you will not escape the suffering of fragmentation or the afflictions of flight.\" Xian, however, clung to his worldly rank and did not heed her words.\n\nThe princess then built a hut on Mount Hua and dwelled there. After a year, her devotion to the alchemical arts evoked a response from the true spirits, and she abandoned her dwelling to depart. Some witnessed her slowly ascending the ravine, borne upon clouds, drifting gently away. Xian entered the mountains in pursuit, crossing deep gorges and climbing towering peaks, his tears flowing as he gazed into the boundless expanse. Suddenly, upon a ridge, he found a pair of red slippers she had left behind—when he reached for them, they had already turned to stone. Thus, the peak was named Princess Peak. Pan Anren composed an account of this, which circulated in the world.\n\n**Guo Shaoyao**\nGuo Shaoyao was the daughter of Guo Sai, the Han dynasty’s General Who Pacified the Liao. From a young age, she was deeply devoted to the Dao, and a perfected person imparted to her the Six Jia, through which she attained transcendence.

After a hundred days in seclusion, her thoughts fixed upon the immortals, her spirit concentrated in earnest devotion, on a midwinter night, four Perfected Ones descended into her tranquil chamber and transmitted the essential teachings of the Dao. Later, the host of Perfected Ones descended again, instructing her to feign illness and achieve *shijie*.

      "translated_text": "The Lady’s Altar stands before the central peak of the Southern Marchmount, atop a massive boulder—a great slab of stone, roughly a *zhang* and some in breadth. Its form is square and steadfast, its base rounded, its top flat, resting lightly upon another stone. When a single person presses against it, the stone may turn, yet when many gather, it stands firm and immovable. This is held to be a numinous wonder, and often immortals and recluses come to rest upon it. Strange clouds and sacred *qi* shroud its summit.\n\nThe *Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* states: \"Lady Wei became the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign, governing the Southern Marchmount.\" The *Declarations of the Perfected* records: \"The Supreme Perfected Controller of Destinies is the Perfected of the Southern Marchmount.\"\n\n**Lady An of Nine Flowers**\nLady An of Nine Flowers was an ancient female immortal who attained the Dao. On the night of the fifteenth day of the sixth month in the third year of the Xingning era of Emperor Ai of Jin, the Purple Tenuity Lady Wang descended to transmit the essential Daoist teachings to the Perfected Yang Xi. She arrived accompanied by a divine maiden, clad in cloud-brocade robes, crimson above and azure below, her raiment radiant with luminous patterns. She appeared to be no more than thirteen or fourteen years of age. Flanking her were two attendants: one held a brocade pouch, a foot and two inches in length, containing over ten scrolls. The pouch’s mouth was sealed with a white jade slip, upon which was inscribed: *Inner True Cinnabar Chapters of the Jade Clarity Divine Tiger*. The other attendant bore a white casket bound with crimson cords, its shape resembling ivory.\n\nThe attendant maidens, around seventeen or eighteen years old, were adorned with extraordinary elegance. The divine maiden and her attendants possessed faces of lustrous purity, clear as jade, their fragrance as intoxicating as burning incense or *xiangying* (a foreign perfume). The Purple Tenuity Lady Wang said: \"This is the youngest daughter of Lady Li of the Golden Terrace, a Supreme Perfected of the Great Void. She once journeyed to Tortoise Mountain to study the Dao of Supreme Clarity. Upon its completion, she received the writ of the Most High and was appointed Nine Flowers Perfected Consort of the Purple Clarity Upper Palace.\" Thus, she was granted the surname An, the personal name Yupin, and the style Lingxiao.\n\nWhen the Perfected Consort arrived, she first held three dates in her hand—hued like dried dates but larger in form, without pits, their taste surpassingly sweet. She gave one to Yang Xi to eat. Afterward, the Perfected Consort presented him with a written gift, and the Purple Tenuity Lady Wang likewise composed a text to enlighten him. Once all the Perfected had received their texts, they departed, leaving only the Perfected Consort to linger briefly. She commanded her attendant to open the sealed pouch and withdraw *The Jade Radiance Purple Reflection Inner Contemplation Hidden Writ* and *The Supreme Clarity Returning Dawn to the Childlike Brilliance of the Central Prime*, two scrolls in total—both texts of the Three Primes and Eight Assemblies—which she entrusted to Yang Xi to transcribe. She further said: \"If you cannot endure the trials of wind and fire, and wish to preserve your true form in secluded groves, you may seek the path of sword-release to perform the rites of final departure.\" Later, Yang Xi indeed achieved sword-release and vanished into concealment, eventually ascending in flight.\n\n**Queen Mother of the River’s North**\nThe female immortal Queen Mother of the River’s North was a woman of the Dao, her age unknown. Only the white-haired He, a companion, was ever seen with her. He, styled Zhongli, was an immortal of the Wei dynasty. Whenever he paid homage to the Queen Mother, she would remain seated and bid him cease his bows.",

Having attained the Dao, she became an attendant to the Lord of the Dao of the Prime, residing in the Palace of the Prime Continent. On all four sides of the continent, primordial waves surge to the heavens—no mortal footprint has ever reached it. Once, the Perfected of Pure Emptiness, Wang, followed the Lord of the Western City to ascend this continent, journeying upward to the Celestial Capital and descending to pay homage to the Lord of the Dao of the Prime. The Lord commanded Baotai to unfurl the green jade scrolls and produce the *Dragon Script of Hidden Writings* and the *Eight Numinous Perfected Scriptures*, which she bestowed upon the Perfected of Pure Emptiness.\n\n**Lady Wang Miaoxiang**\nThe female Perfected Wang Miaoxiang entered the Dao in her youth and dwelled at the Yellow Court Abbey on Mount Cangwu. She practiced grain avoidance and qi-absorption, building her hermitage beside the waters of Linxuan. After more than fifty years, her appearance remained that of a woman of eighteen or nineteen. Each time she recited the *Yellow Court*, her sincerity moved the unseen. One day, suddenly, a dense fragrance of numinous incense filled the courtyard, auspicious clouds suffused the grounds, celestial music resounded through the sky, and radiant light illuminated the altar hall. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders descended from the void, their banners and crane canopies heralding the arrival of nine dragon-borne immortals, who alighted before the altar. There appeared a transcendent official in feathered robes and a jeweled crown, a sword at his waist and trailing slippers, who ascended the hall and seated himself, his body emanating five-colored light. Miaoxiang approached to pay her respects, and the transcendent official said to her: \"I am the Lord Shun, sovereign of the ancient Youyu dynasty, who wearied of governing the myriad states and cultivated the Dao upon this mountain. I have long wished to guide and instruct later generations, that they might awaken to the Dao, yet the world holds none worthy of teaching. The Dao resides within, not without; it dwells in your own person, not in another. As the *Mysterious Scripture* says: *Cultivate it in your person, and your virtue shall be true.*\n\nRecently, the Earthly Bureau memorialized that you have dwelled upon this mountain for over thirty years, unwavering from beginning to end, guarding the Dao without deviation, preserving sincerity in your thoughts, and upholding the precepts and commandments. If you have yet to achieve realization, this would be the Dao’s abandonment of you. Yet the *Mysterious Scripture* states: *Ever excelling in saving beings, thus nothing is abandoned.* The Dao’s grace is universally bestowed, desiring the perfection of all things and the salvation of all people. But worldly beings possess meager karmic fruits and shallow Dao-qi, unable to persevere with diligence and constancy. Before the Dao-qi responds, they have already grown weary and desist. Thus, it is people who abandon the Dao, not the Dao that abandons people.\n\nYour single-minded sincerity, your resolve to seek realization across a hundred or a thousand lifetimes without slackening or retreat—this is deeply moving. In the past, I encountered the Most High Lord Lao, who revealed to me the *True Scripture of Dao and Virtue*, teaching the governance of the state and the cultivation of the self, the salvation of beings and the propagation of teachings. These can penetrate heaven and earth, pervade the myriad things, serving as the essence of transformative practice and the foundation of sagely rule. Yet words cannot fully express it. The worldly, mired in superficial deceit, scorn humility and restraint as cowardice, dismiss withdrawal as impractical folly, ridicule the renunciation of sagacity and wisdom as absurd, and deride the abandonment of benevolence and righteousness as perverse. Such is the delusion of this degenerate age.\n\nThe intent of the Mysterious Sages is to restore simplicity and return to the uncarved block, to exalt the Dao and cast out the perverse. Once the crooked paths are cleared away, the Supreme Dao will naturally manifest.\"",

The world, in perfect harmony, returns to the Great Compliance—such is the grand aim of the Mysterious Sages.\n\nHaving traversed the cycles of time, I now dwell in this mountain, where I often dispatch immortal officials to teach the people the Dao of enduring vision and non-action. For the exalted sages and perfected beings, moved by the impermanence of kalpas and the ceaseless flux of cosmic eras—where yin and yang alternate, life and death succeed one another—swiftly arrive at the conjunction of the Nine and Hundred-Six, and thus diligently descend to instruct and save humanity, their efforts all the more urgent for those who seek the Dao.\n\nYet those who seek the Dao in the world waver between presence and absence, their thoughts and intentions scattered, scarcely one in ten thousand truly devoted.

Beneath them lie treasures of jade and the five metals, divine mushrooms and sacred herbs, medicines guarded by the Three Heavens, and scriptures concealed by the Most High. Some rest in stone chambers and jade terraces, others in cloud-wreathed cliffs and secluded valleys, all overseen by spirit wardens, free from venomous creatures or predatory beasts. Here one may transcend the world, nurture life, cultivate the Dao, and ascend to perfection.\n\nSince you have resided here, you have never explored the four directions, nor gazed upon the towering peaks—thus you remain unaware of these wonders. Strive in your practice, and soon you shall ride the light through empty space, then invert the radiance to fathom its origins and ends.\n\nThereupon, I commanded the attendants of the imperial chamber to bestow upon you the *Scriptures of Dao and Virtue* and the *Lingwen of Abiding Radiance* before departing.

      "translated_text": "Wang Fengxian was born into a poor family, her parents earning their livelihood through farming. At the age of fourteen, while in the fields, she suddenly saw a group of ten or so young maidens in blue attire playing with her. After a long while, they dispersed. The next day, she returned to the same field and saw them again as before. Over a month later, the maidens gathered at her home at night, laughing and talking through the evening until dawn before departing. Sometimes they brought rare fruits to sate her hunger—things not of this world. Though her room was narrow, even with many visitors, it never felt cramped. Her parents grew suspicious and spied on her, but saw nothing. Fearing she was bewitched by some demonic entity, they reproached her severely, yet she always deflected with other excuses. From then on, the maidens visited by day, accompanying her on distant journeys to places far and wide, returning only at dusk. Fengxian gradually ceased eating and drinking, and her strangeness became more apparent. One day, her parents saw her perched atop the bamboo in their courtyard; she leapt down and landed on the ground. When asked the reason, she revealed that the maidens she met were all immortal women, and that she ascended and descended the bamboo to travel to and from the heavens. The maidens also trimmed her hair, cutting it evenly at her brows in front and letting it hang to her shoulders in back, where it ceased to grow. Her skin became smooth and lustrous as ice and jade, her bright eyes and extraordinary features resembling those of a celestial being. Her wisdom and eloquence surpassed others, and her words carried profound and subtle truths. Once, she told a learned person: \"What I have encountered is the Dao; what I have attained is immortality; the women I have seen are all immortal women.\"\n\nEach time she visited the heavenly palaces, she saw the abodes of the highest immortals—many clad in embroidered robes, wearing flowered crowns and holding jade tablets, carrying divine flowers and sacred herbs, chanting sacred verses. Sometimes they ascended to the Cloud Gate or the Mushroom Fields, or wandered through jade palaces and crystal towers, discussing the affairs of attaining immortality and transcending the world. They traveled above the Milky Way, journeying thousands upon thousands of miles. Upon first arriving in heaven, she entered the Palace of Great Abundance, where the Heavenly Worthy resided in a vast hall, attended by countless immortals. Fengxian paid her respects, and the Heavenly Worthy ordered his attendants to present her with a cup of jade nectar, saying: \"You possess the bones of an immortal and are destined to ascend. However, the kalpa of this world is not yet complete, and you shall return here in fifty years. The grains of the earth harm one’s true qi when consumed, and the fruits of trees and grasses diminish one’s lifespan. You should practice grain avoidance and cultivate your true nature.\" From then on, she ate nothing for twenty years.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy transforms in the heavens, governing all things like a father to the world. The World-Honored One transforms in the world, exhorting people to goodness like a mother. The Confucian classics circulate among the world like elder brothers. All people are like infants, knowing only their mother but unaware of the reverence due to their father and elder brothers. Thus, those who understand the Dao are few, and those who esteem Confucianism are rare—this is not surprising. What Fengxian saw in heaven was no different from the Dao of today, and she never beheld any images of bodhisattvas, buddhas, or monks.\n\nFengxian often depicted meritorious deeds in paintings, mostly illustrating the courtly attire of heavenly beings, emperors, and Daoist lords, which she titled *Court of Heaven*. She traveled through the regions of Huai and Zhe, and wherever she went, crowds gathered to see her. Fengxian taught men and women the ways of loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and uprightness, as well as the principles of purity, frugality, and the essentials of cultivating oneself through secret practices. Thus, she was revered far and wide. Gold, jade, treasures, and offerings piled before her, numbering in the tens of thousands, yet she declined them all. Fengxian lived with her two younger sisters on Mount Dongting, later moving to Mount Xiang in Qiantang. Her two sisters and disciples maintained the incense and lamps, constructing magnificent halls without ever faltering in their efforts.\n\nOne day, she passed away at the age of eighteen, fulfilling the fifty-year prophecy. In her daily meditation, she could perceive events a thousand miles away. When she concentrated her thoughts and projected her spirit, she would ascend to the Nine Heavens. As she neared the end of her life, clouds and cranes descended repeatedly, and extraordinary fragrances filled her chamber. After her transformation, her body remained supple and moist, her skin as if still alive. Those who recognized the signs understood this as a *shijie*—a liberation through the simulated death of the body.\n\n**Immortal Woman Wang**\nImmortal Woman Wang was the niece of Prime Minister Wang Huizhi. At the time, her father, a member of the Hanlin Academy, had traveled to the capital on official business, and Wang, along with her mother Pei and her brother Liu, resided beneath the Cassia Crag in the mountains of Yixing, neighboring the Cave Spirit Abbey. From a young age, Wang was drawn to the Dao. She abstained from wine and meat, maintained a dignified demeanor, and delighted in solitude. Sometimes she played the zither for pleasure, or composed poetry and prose for her own amusement. She recited the *Perfect Writ of the Great Cavern*, the *Scripture of Salvation*, and the *Verses on the Dao and Virtue* within her chamber, where an unusual fragrance often lingered, distinct from ordinary scents. Her parents, awed by her, once secretly asked her mother: \"The Grotto Palace has issued a summons, appointing me to an immortal office. I cannot refuse, but I fear I must journey far.\" Her mother did not understand her meaning.\n\nOne day, she fell slightly ill. Pei and Liu, who cherished her deeply, prayed for her at the Cave Spirit Abbey. That day, she improved slightly and accompanied them to the abbey, where they paid homage to the sacred images. Standing in the courtyard, burning incense, she seemed to be making a vow. By evening, they returned home. To the right of the door stood a large rock, upon which she inscribed a poem:\n\n*Endlessly climbing mountains, fording streams,*\n*The immortals descend again to hear my zither’s themes.*\n*This heart holds no love for worldly affairs,*\n*Only the sight of twin cranes soaring through the air.*\n\nThat night, she passed away suddenly. By dawn, a pair of cranes perched in the trees of the courtyard, celestial music filled the sky, and an extraordinary fragrance suffused the fields. The news spread, and people from near and far rushed to witness the marvel. Her body was placed in her chamber, clothed as in life.",

Years later, Miao Xiang ascended to heaven at sunrise, and the abbey where she dwelled was renamed the Abbey of Nurturing the Dao.\n\nThis mountain, where Shun cultivated the Dao, is thus called Daozhou.

One evening, a beautiful woman arrived and left a poem:\n\n*I dwell in the registers of the Upper Clarity,*\n*Exiled to wander the Five Peaks.*\n*As you bear no worldly burdens,*\n*I come to urge you toward the study of immortals’ arts.*\n\nRen refused to receive her. Three days later, she returned and said, \"I am no spectral phantom but one whose name is listed among the highest immortals. The unseen reckoning has ordained that we be joined as mates.\" She then presented another poem:\n\n*Ge Hong, too, had a wife,*\n*The Queen Mother, too, had a husband.*\n*All immortals are spirit-mates—*\n*What say you, noble sir?*\n\nRen remained silent. The woman continued, \"Ruan Zhao was deluded and failed to awaken—how then shall I express my sincerity?\" She added:\n\n*In the springtime moon above the sea,*\n*The kingfisher plumes return in vain.*\n\nSeveral months later, Ren fell ill and died, only to be pursued by underworld officials. On the road, he encountered a procession of banners and a jade-green palanquin, within which a woman laughed and said, \"This is the ill-fated scholar of Mount Song.\" She took the documents from the officials, examined them, and declared, \"Now that we have met, I cannot be without feeling.\" She seized a brush and wrote a judgment: *\"Grant him three more years.\"* Ren bowed in gratitude. The officials said, \"This is the Purple Essence Primordial Sovereign, the most exalted of the immortal officials.\" They escorted him back, and Ren lived for three more years before passing away. This was a trial sent by a true immortal to test mortals—Ren, having maintained his integrity, was thus granted an extension of three years.\n\n**Zhao Sutai**\n\nZhao Sutai was the daughter of Zhao Xi, Governor of Youzhou during the Han dynasty. Xi had performed many virtuous deeds in his youth, often aiding the destitute and rescuing the Wang Hui clan from execution, accumulating hidden merits in dozens of instances. As a result, he ascended in person to the Vermilion Mound, and his sons gained the ability to vanish and wander the grotto-heavens. Sutai had resided in the Palace of Shifting Transitions for four hundred years and refused to leave, declaring that nowhere else in the world brought her such joy. She often traveled in humble disguise, delighting in the mountains and marshes. The Lady of Shifting Transitions was her equal in rank.\n\n**Huang Jinghua**\n\nHuang Jinghua was the daughter of Huang Qiong, Minister of Works during the Han dynasty. From a young age, Jinghua was devoted to the Dao of immortals and secretly cultivated its essential practices. Later, she became a disciple of Han Zhong, who transmitted to her the elixir formula of Mount Min.

She studied under Master Du Qi, receiving the essentials of the Mysterious and White, and her countenance grew ever more youthful. Traversing the mountains of Wu and Yue for over a decade, she at last attained the immortal Dao and departed. Another account holds that she was the granddaughter of the Great Emperor of Wu and cultivated the Dao on Mount Mao. Upon achieving transcendence, she ascended in emptiness, and the mountain was thereafter named Hua Lao Shan. The mountain stands before the Chongxi Abbey on Mount Mao.\n\n**Wang Jinxian**\nWang Jinxian was the daughter of Wang Yan, Minister of Works under Emperor Wu of Jin, and wife to Prince Yu Huai. When Liu Yao and Shi Le plundered the Jin nobility and crossed the Mengjin Ford of the Yellow River, they sought to take her as a wife. Jinxian cursed them, saying: *\"I am the consort of the Crown Prince and daughter of the Minister of Works. How dare you barbarian whelps presume to touch me?\"* With that, she cast herself into the river. Her maidservant, named Liuchu, then declared: *\"If the great one has done so, the lesser should do the same.\"* And she too leapt into the river. At that moment, the female immortal Han Xihua of Mount Song, who was traveling abroad, took pity on them. She embraced and rescued the two, preserving their lives in secret while outwardly feigning death. Their bodies were secretly conveyed away and taken into Mount Song, where they now dwell within the *Yi Qian* Grotto of the Huayang Palace. Liuchu was then twenty-two or twenty-three years old, of refined appearance and resolute character. Her surname was originally Tian, and she was a native of Yuyang, the granddaughter of Tian Feng, former Prefect of Junyi under Wei. Feng had performed many acts of hidden virtue, which extended to Liuchu. (The *Book of Jin* records a slightly different version.)\n\n**Li Xizi**\nLi Xizi was the grandmother of Li Zhong, Grand Administrator of Dongping under Jin, though her surname remains unknown. Zhong’s grandfather lived in reclusion, his nature marked by compassion and mercy, and he devoted himself to hidden virtue. Xizi was single-minded in her resolve, ever devoted to saving others. In times of heavy snow and bitter cold, she would heap rice and millet in the garden courtyard, fearing that birds might starve. Such was the depth of her care. She now dwells in the Huayang Grotto, having attained the Dao.\n\n**Lady Fan**\nLady Fan was the wife of Liu Gang, Celestial Master of Jin. Once, she and her husband tested their arts while seated in the hall. Gang conjured a fire that burned the tiled roof, beginning from the east, but Lady Fan restrained it, and the flames were extinguished. In the courtyard stood two peach trees. Husband and wife each pointed at one, commanding them to strike each other. After a long while, the tree Gang had fixed his gaze upon faltered and retreated beyond the fence several times. Gang spat into a tray, and it became a carp. Lady Fan spat into the tray, and it became an otter that devoured the fish. When the couple entered the Siming Mountains, their path was blocked by a tiger. Gang restrained it, and the beast crouched motionless, but when they attempted to pass, it roared. Lady Fan strode forward, and the tiger prostrated itself, unable to lift its gaze. She struck it with a rope and led it away, tethering it beneath a tree. Later, when the couple ascended to heaven, Gang had served as Magistrate of Shangyu. In the county hall stood a great honey locust tree, and Gang had to climb several *zhang* up its trunk before he could take flight. Lady Fan, however, rose gently as if borne upon clouds, and together they ascended to heaven.\n\nDuring the *Zhenyuan* era of Emperor Dezong of Tang, there lived an old woman of Xiang who healed illnesses with cinnabar talismans. One day, she told her villagers: *\"I am going to Dongting to save hundreds of lives.\"* The day before she arrived, a great storm arose. A massive boat carrying over a hundred people from Junshan was stranded on an island, where a white turtle emerged from the sand and began devouring them. The next day, a wall of snow encircled the island, gradually tightening until the easterners were herded into a cluster no more than a few *zhang* wide. The people of Yueyang watched from afar, bewildered by the snowy fortress. When the old woman reached the shore, she hurled a flying sword, piercing the white wall with a thunderous crash. It collapsed, revealing a white dragon over ten *zhang* long, writhing in death. Later, a Daoist surmised that the old woman of Xiang was none other than Lady Fan, wife of Liu Gang.\n\n**The Divine Mother of Dongling**\nThe Divine Mother of Dongling was a native of Guangling. She married into the Du clan and studied the Dao under Liu Gang. Skilled in transformation and concealment, she could appear and vanish at will. Practicing the arts of the Central Scripture, she achieved the power to sit in death while standing. Her husband, Lord Du, disbelieved in the Dao and often resented the Divine Mother. She devoted herself to healing the sick and aiding others, but the more she did, the more he raged, slandering her as a sorceress and reporting her to the authorities. When the Divine Mother was imprisoned, she escaped through the window in an instant. The crowd watched as she soared higher and higher into the clouds, leaving behind only a single slipper beneath the window. Thereafter, temples were erected for her far and wide, and the people revered her. Prayers to her were highly efficacious. A green crow often perched at her altar, and if someone lost an item and inquired after it, the crow would fly to alight upon the thief’s head. Thus, the roads were free of lost property. Over time, this ceased. To this day, in Hailing County, no one dares commit theft or villainy—those who do great evil are drowned in wind and waves or devoured by wolves and tigers, while lesser offenders fall ill.\n\n**Yunying**\nPei Hang hired a boat on the Xiang and Han rivers, where he encountered Lady Fan, a woman of peerless beauty. He bribed her maid, Niaoyan, to deliver a poem:\n\n*\"Though north and south share this boat, my heart still yearns,\nA mortal meets a celestial beyond the brocade screen.\nIf you ascend to the Jade Capital for the morning court,\nI would follow the phoenix and crane into the azure heavens.\"*\n\nLady Fan replied: *\"My husband dwells south of the Han. I pray you do not take offense at my jest. Though our bond is slight, one day it shall become a marriage of harmony.\"* She answered with a poem:\n\n*\"A sip of cloud-nectar stirs a hundred emotions,\nPounding frost reveals the elusive Yunying.\nThe Blue Bridge is the abode of immortals—\nWhy trouble yourself with the arduous climb to the Jade Capital?\"*\n\nLater, Pei Hang passed through the Lanqiao Post Station, parched with thirst. An old woman in a thatched hut was spinning hemp when he bowed and begged for a drink. She said: *\"Yunying brings a bowl of nectar.\"* He took it and drank—it was truly ambrosia.",

      "translated_text": "Pei Hang said to the old woman: *\"The young lady is breathtakingly beautiful. Would you consent to my marrying her?\"* The old woman replied: *\"This frail old body has but this granddaughter, left behind by an immortal with a single *daogui* of elixir. It must be ground in a jade mortar and pestle for a hundred days to be complete. If you wish to wed her, bring me the jade mortar and pestle, and I shall give her to you in marriage. Gold and silk are of no use to me.\"* Disheartened, Pei Hang departed.\n\nA month later, he indeed obtained the mortar and pestle and returned to the Blue Bridge. The old woman untied the pouch at her waist, took out the medicine, and began to grind it. Pei Hang immediately joined in. That night, as she gathered the medicine into her chamber, Pei Hang glimpsed a jade hare wielding the pestle, its snow-bright radiance illuminating the room. After a hundred days, the medicine was ready. The old woman swallowed it and said: *\"I shall enter the grotto. Prepare the bridal chamber for Master Pei.\"*\n\nSuddenly, a grand mansion appeared, and immortal youths and maidservants led Pei inside. Among the many divine kin, a woman addressed him as her brother-in-law. She said: *\"Do you not recall sailing together at Ezhu, arriving at Xiang and Han?\"* Those around her explained: *\"This is Lady Yunqiao, wife of the Celestial Master Liu Gang and a scribe to the Jade Emperor.\"* Pei took his wife into the Jade Peak Grotto, where they partook of cinnabar snow and jade blossom elixirs, ascending together as transcendent immortals.\n\n---\n\n**Bao Gu**\n\nBao Gu was the daughter of Bao Shuo, Governor of Nanhai, and the wife of Ge Hong, Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary of the Jin Dynasty. Shuo, styled Taixuan, was a native of Chenliu. From youth, he possessed keen insight, penetrating the hidden and obscure. With a mind sunk in profound contemplation, none could fathom his depths. Shuo and his younger sister had accumulated layers of hidden virtue across generations, and their blessings extended to him, allowing them all to attain the Dao. Gu and her younger sister both ascended to the ranks of immortals.\n\nShuo’s learning encompassed the warp and weft of the classics. Later, he studied under Zuo Yuanfang, receiving the Central Scripture and the essentials of summoning the Three Sovereigns and Five Peaks. His practice proved spiritually efficacious, enabling him to command ghosts and gods, seal mountains, and subdue demons. In the first year of *Daxing* (318 CE) of Emperor Yuan of the Eastern Jin, Shuo encountered the Perfected One Yin Changsheng on Mount Jiang and was granted the *daojie* defense. Repeatedly summoned to serve as Gentleman of the Yellow Gate, he sought instead the governorship of Nanhai so that Gu might marry Ge Zhichuan.\n\nZhichuan, formerly Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary, became Magistrate of Goulou County to refine cinnabar. Taixuan, while in Nanhai, saw his youngest daughter suddenly fall ill and die. As he entertained guests at the time, he showed no grief. She was buried on Mount Luofu, her complexion as lifelike as ever—all believed it a case of *shijie*. When Shuo returned to Danyang, he died and was buried at Shizigang. Later, during the rebellion of Su Jun, his tomb was opened, revealing no corpse—only a great sword. When the rebels attempted to take it, they heard the sound of troops and horses on either side of the tomb and fled in terror. From within the tomb came a rumbling like thunder, and the rebels scattered. After the rebellion was quelled, the sword was recovered and reburied.\n\nShuo and his sister had also mastered the art of *shijie*, and Gu and Zhichuan ascended to immortality in succession.\n\nLater, a man named Cui Wei lived in Nanhai. On the *Zhongyuan* Festival, the people of Panyu displayed rare treasures at the temple. Wei went to observe and saw an old woman stumble, knocking over someone’s wine jar. The tavern keeper struck her, but Wei rushed forward and asked: *\"How much is the wine worth?\"* The keeper replied: *\"One string of cash.\"* Wei immediately removed his robe to pay for it, but the old woman left without thanks.\n\nSome days later, Wei encountered her again on the road. She said: *\"I have not forgotten your kindness in resolving my trouble. I am skilled in curing tumors. Here is a small bundle of Yuejinggang mugwort as a token of gratitude. If you encounter someone with a tumor, it can be cured—no more than one cauterization will be needed.\"* Later, Wei met a monk whose tumor hung from his ear; one cauterization healed it instantly. The monk then led him to a wealthy household where a man suffered from a tumor, and one treatment cured him as well. From then on, Wei’s reputation spread, and many sought his aid. In time, he became a rich man, yet he never forgot the old woman, thinking of her day and night.",

      "translated_text": "Mother Liang, widowed and childless, kept an inn at Pingyuan Pavilion. Travelers who came to rest there felt as though they had returned home. When guests repaid her, she never once mentioned the amount. Even those who stayed for months never wearied of her hospitality. Beyond clothing and food, she gave all she earned to the poor and sick. Once, a young man stayed for over a month, his behavior unlike that of ordinary people. As he departed, he said, *\"I am the Little Lad of the Eastern Sea.\"* Mother Liang did not know who the Little Lad was.\n\nIn the fourth year of Yuanhui of Emperor Cangwu of Song (the *bingshen* year), the Daoist Xu Daosheng of Ma’er Mountain was traveling to Mengyin when, west of Fengcheng, he encountered a carriage drawn by a black ram, which halted on its own. A young boy called out, *\"Daoist Xu, come forward.\"* Xu stepped closer, stopping about three paces from the carriage. Above him, he saw two more boys, aged around twelve or thirteen, both dressed in yellow robes with crimson sashes, their hair tied in topknots. Their bearing was so refined that none in the world could compare. A child from the carriage relayed a message: *\"I am Mother Liang of the Pingyuan inn. The Supreme has summoned me back, and I must pass by Penglai to seek Master Wang Qiao, then proceed to Mount Tai for inspection. I wished to see you, and here you are. The divine reins flutter, the dark net spreads its banners, but the post stations are few, and the daily journey spans three thousand *li*. Our meeting draws near, yet my heart is heavy with care. Soon I shall ascend to the Three Clarities, and these three boys will escort me to the Dark Capital. Convey my gratitude to the faithful men and women of the East: the Great Peace is near, and one in ten shall be delivered. Guide them well, for beyond this, there shall be no peril.\"*\n\nShe raised her hand in farewell, saying, *\"Until we meet in the Great Peace.\"* The carriage soared away, vanishing into the distance. When Xu returned to the inn and inquired, it was the very day Mother Liang had transcended the world.\n\n*Immortal Lady Xu*\nImmortal Lady Xu was the daughter of Xu Zhicai, a minister of the Sui dynasty. Though her teacher’s name is unknown, she had already lived for several centuries, her appearance ever that of a woman of twenty-four or twenty-five. Skilled in protective incantations, she wandered alone across the land, visiting the Three Rivers and Five Peaks, Tiantai and Siming, Luofu and Kuocang—all the famous mountains and sacred sites. She often lodged in caves beneath cliffs or among forest grottos, or else stayed in temples. One day, a group of ruffians approached with honeyed words and lewd advances. The Lady rebuked them sharply. Enraged, they drew blades to threaten her, but her demeanor only grew more composed. She laughed and said, *\"I am a woman who has abandoned home and family to wander like clouds and water, unafraid of dragons or tigers. Do you think I fear the likes of you?\"* She then removed her outer robe and extinguished their torch. The men rejoiced, believing they had prevailed.\n\nThe next morning, as the Lady prepared to leave the mountain, the ruffians stood frozen in place, their bodies rigid as if bound, their mouths sealed and unable to speak. Only after she had traveled several *li* did they return to normal. She traveled throughout the Jiangbiao region, and the people of Wu saw her for over forty years, her countenance unchanged. She moved as swiftly as if flying, and wherever she went, people revered her as a deity, none daring to jest or offend with impure intentions. In the early years of Xiantong under Emperor Yizong of Tang, she said to Jia Yuntao, a Daoist of the White Crane Abbey in Zhan County, *\"My late father served in the Zhou and Sui dynasties, renowned for his arts. His hidden merits extended to all things, and now he too has attained the Dao.

      "translated_text": "Hua Gu—Hua Gu was the Daoist nun Huang Lingwei. Though eighty years of age, she retained the appearance of youth, her countenance like that of an infant. Her Daoist practice was lofty and pure, and the world called her Hua Gu. She walked at a leisurely pace in her hempen sandals, yet even galloping horses could not overtake her. Her origins were unknown. From the early Tang, she wandered between Jiang, Zhe, Hu, and the Ling Mountains, visiting every renowned mountain and sacred grotto without exception. Wherever she passed or lodged in the wilds, spirits guarded her. If anyone harbored impure intentions and sought to insult or violate her, they would immediately suffer misfortune. Far and near, people revered and honored her as a deity, serving her as if she were divine.\n\nShe had heard that the Lady Wei of South Mountain had once crossed the river to cultivate the Dao, leaving behind an altar and oratory in Linchuan Prefecture. On the western side of the Ruzhui River, at Stone Well Mountain, there stood a immortals’ altar. She set out to seek it. Over the years, the site had become overgrown with brambles and obscured by thickets, so that none in her time knew of it. In the winter of the second year of Changshou during the reign of Empress Wu Zetian of Tang—the year *renchen*—she traveled to West Mountain in Hongzhou to visit the Daoist Hu Huichao and inquire about it. Hu, styled Basu, was one who could commune with the divine. He pointed her to a place six *li* south of the city walls, called Tortoise Mound, where an ancient stone tortoise stood. Whenever it encroached upon the fields, people would strike its head, and there it had broken—this was the very site. Hua Gu searched and found the altar nearby, still standing clearly in its original place. Beneath it, she uncovered a revered statue, oil jars, a weighing knife, lamp dishes, and other relics. She repaired and restored the site.\n\nLater, in a dream, Lady Wei directed her to a Nine-Bend Pool south of the altar. She sought it out and found it, its broad steps still intact. During the Jingyun era, Emperor Ruizong sent the Daoist Ye Shanxin, bearing embroidered images and incense, to perform rites. A Dongling Abbey was then built west of the altar, and seven Daoist nuns were ordained to reside there. By the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, offerings and prayers continued without cease. Whenever wind and rain arose, the sound of flutes and pipes could be heard.",
      "overlap_context": "ered her as a deity, none daring to jest or offend with impure intentions. In the early years of Xiantong under Emperor Yizong of Tang, she said to Jia Yuntao, a Daoist of the White Crane Abbey in Zhan County, *\"My late father served in the Zhou and Sui dynasties, renowned for his arts. His hidden merits extended to all things, and now he too has attained the Dao. Thus, I have been blessed with good fortune and longevity as well.\"* From this, it is clear she was indeed the daughter of Xu Zhicai.",

      "translated_text": "For all rites and visits, strict purity was required—otherwise, serpents and tigers would roar in alarm. At times, cloud-like phenomena would appear, resembling crows or trailing grasses, descending directly upon the altar. In an instant, they would vanish to the west, as if toward Jingshan, occurring more than once. Hua Gu, her spirit resonant and attuned, received a secret revelation: \"The ancient border of Jingshan—you must restore it with reverence.\" Soon after, an extraordinary fragrance wafted from the west. Hua Gu, having repeatedly received auspicious signs, personally oversaw the repairs. Passing the night at the cave’s entrance, she heard the sound of chimes, and though the land had long lain desolate, it was as if someone guided her to lodge amid the wilds, where she rested in perfect peace. At dawn, entering the mountain, she indeed found the remnants of the altar hall. There, she erected buildings, and the celestial chants of *buxu* and the hymns of immortals echoed for miles around the altar. Those who came to gather firewood without proper reverence invariably encountered strange and startling phenomena. A wild elephant, pierced by an arrow, came to Hua Gu for aid, and she removed it. Thereafter, before each ritual, the elephant would offer lotus roots to her in tribute.\n\nIn the ninth year of Emperor Xuanzong’s Kaiyuan era, the xin-you year, Hua Gu, sensing her ascension was near, told her disciples: \"My celestial journey hastens—I cannot remain long. After my transformation, do not nail the coffin shut; simply drape it with a crimson gauze veil.\" The next day, she passed without illness. Her skin remained fragrant and pure, her body warm, and an uncommon fragrance filled the hall. Her disciples followed her instructions: the coffin was left unnailed, covered only with crimson gauze. Suddenly, a thunderous crash resounded, and a hole the size of a chicken’s egg appeared in the gauze. Inside the coffin lay only a wooden tablet wrapped in silk. A gap in the roof, large enough for a person to pass through, had formed. Melons placed as offerings sprouted vines within days, bearing two fruits like peaches. Each year on the anniversary of her passing, winds and clouds would surge violently, entering the chamber.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong, astonished upon hearing of this, ordered the event recorded. The next day, he dispatched the Daoist Cai Wei to include it in the *Later Biographies of Immortals*. In the twenty-eighth year of the Kaiyuan era, the geng-chen year, the third month, the yi-you day, the Daoist Zi Longbi arrived to perform rites. Suddenly, a white deer emerged from the east of the altar, approached Hua Gu’s tomb, and vanished—precisely where her wooden tablet was buried. Five-colored immortal maidens then gathered upon the altar. Prefect Zhang Jingyi, moved by such sacred virtue, erected a stele to commemorate the event.\n\nIn the eighth year of the Tianbao era, the ji-chou year, at the site where Lady Wei ascended, two Daoist nuns were ordained to maintain the incense and offerings. In the third year of Emperor Daizong’s Dali era, the wu-shen year, Yan Zhenqing, Duke of Lu Commandery and Prefect of Fuzhou, seeing the old border in ruins and lacking caretakers, summoned the Daoist Huang Daojin and thirteen others from Xianling Abbey to reside at Dongling Abbey. He also appointed seven virtuous Daoist nuns, led by Li Qiongxian, to dwell at the Immortal Altar. Yan composed and personally inscribed the *Stele of the Immortal Altar* to record these events.\n\n**Jiao Jingzhen**\nJiao Jingzhen, a Tang dynasty female immortal, through deep meditation, was guided to Fangzhang Mountain, where she encountered two celestial maidens. They told her: \"If you wish to attain the rank of a true official, you must pay homage to the Azure Lad of the Eastern Flower and receive the Three Sovereigns’ teachings.\" When she asked their names, they replied: \"Sima Chengzhen.\" Returning, she sought ordination from Chengzhen and soon ascended to heaven. She once descended to tell Xue Jichang: \"Your attainment surpasses that of Ren of Taodu Waters; you shall become the Azure Lad of the Eastern Flower, a Perfected One of the Highest Clarity.\"\n\n**Wang Fajin**\nWang Fajin was a native of Linjin County in Jianzhou.",

      "translated_text": "In his infancy, he was naturally drawn to the Dao. His home stood near an ancient abbey, though no Daoist priests dwelt there; yet in his play, he never treated it with disrespect, and whenever he saw its sacred images, he would clasp his hands in reverence. When he reached his teens, a female priest from Jianzhou passed through the neighboring villages and stopped at his home. His parents, seeing his devotion to the Dao, entrusted him to her care. She transmitted to him the *Zhengyi Yansheng Lu* and gave him the name Fajin. From then on, he devoted himself to tending incense and maintaining fasts, even consuming cypress leaves and abstaining from grains, and at times experienced divine manifestations.\n\nThat year, famine struck the Three Rivers region; grain prices soared, and five or six out of every ten people perished. Many survived by foraging for mountain tubers and wild vines. Suddenly, two Azure Lads descended into his courtyard and proclaimed the decree of the Supreme Emperor: \"As you were born with the bones of an immortal and have devoted yourself to the Dao with unwavering sincerity, we now summon you as an Azure Lad to serve in the Jade Capital.\" Fajin immediately rose with the Azure Lads, soaring through the void until they reached the abode of the Celestial Emperor. The Emperor presented him with a jade cup filled with rosy nectar. After he drank, the Emperor said:\n\n\"Humans are endowed with the great essence of the Three Powers and the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth, making it no easy matter to attain human form and be born in the Central Land. The celestial cycles of the four seasons and the terrestrial flourishing of the Five Phases give rise to the Five Grains and a hundred fruits to nourish humanity. Yet people fail to recognize the nurturing grace of Heaven and Earth, carelessly wasting grain and disdaining hemp and silk. Thus, the farmers who till the soil and the women who spin and weave toil without sustenance, exhaust themselves without warmth, their labor squandered without appreciation. This is surely a transgression before the divine spirits, and Heaven and Earth will not protect them.\n\nRecently, the earthly officials of the mountains and rivers have each submitted memorials, reporting that people despise the Five Grains and fail to honor the roots of clothing and food. I have already commanded the Palace of Mount Taihua to recall the spirits of the Five Grains, causing their crops to fail. The common people suffer hunger as a warning and punishment to correct their ways. Yet the foolish masses remain oblivious. Soon after, I received the decree of the Most High, who, in the Dao’s love for life, declared that the wicked should not be allowed to harm the virtuous. Though Heaven, Earth, and the divine spirits punish them, the ignorant masses do not understand the cause of their transgressions, have no path to repentance, and suffer in vain.\n\nYou shall now serve as an Attendant Lad of the Highest Realm, entering the Celestial Palace. For now, I command you to descend and admonish the people below, urging them to repent their sins, cherish silkworms, honor agriculture, treasure the Five Grains and all fruits, recognize the nurturing power of the Great Dao, and the generative force of the fertile earth. They must revere the true Dao and worship the divine spirits. They must not disdain the use of water and fire, and should practice frugality in clothing and food. If all can observe these clear precepts, Heaven and Earth will cherish them, the divine spirits will protect them, wind and rain will be harmonious, and families and nations will enjoy peace. This will also augment your hidden merit.\"\n\nThe Emperor then commanded an attendant maiden to present him with a robe adorned with *langgan* pearls and bestowed upon him a scroll of the *Lingbao Qingzhai Jiao Xie Tiandi Fa*, instructing him to propagate it in the world. He said: \"Let the people gather in places of purity to perform rites of repentance and thanksgiving. Twice a year, in spring and autumn, they should hold these rites—spring to pray for a bountiful harvest, autumn to give thanks for the power of the Dao. In this way, past transgressions may be erased, and the spirits of the Grain Father and Silkworm Mother will ensure abundance. In the year of the Dragon and Tiger, I shall summon you again.\" The Azure Lads then escorted him home, where three months had already passed.\n\nThe scripture he received is the *Lingbao Qingzhai Gaoxie Tiandi Fa*, a method simple and accessible, much like the *Lingbao Ziran Zhai*. Yet when practiced among the people, its efficacy is immediately evident. If even the mats, utensils, or vessels are treated with slight disrespect or impurity, or if those conducting the rites harbor impure intentions, swift winds and torrential rains will destroy the altar, and thunderbolts will shatter the implements. From then on, the people of the Three Rivers and Liang-Han regions annually observed these rites. Even the simple and the reckless trembled in reverence, holding the method in solemn awe.\n\nWherever locusts, droughts, or floods harmed the crops and injured the farmers, those who led the people in sincere devotion, offering incense and prayers to Heaven day and night, invariably received divine protection. The contrast with the irreverent and faithless was immediately apparent. In the south of the region, it was called the *Qingzhai*; in Shu lands, it was known as the *Tiangong Zhai*—both were of the same principle.\n\nIn the eleventh year of the Tianbao era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the year *renchen* (752), Fajin was borne away by cloud-cranes to ascend to Heaven, fulfilling the prophecy of the Dragon and Tiger year spoken by the divine beings.\n\n**Fei Miaoxing**\nFei Miaoxing was the wife of Sun Tianzhen, a Tang dynasty Celestial Master. In the seventh year of the Tianbao era (748), the Celestial Master petitioned for the establishment of an abbey and the ordination of seven female Daoist priests to conduct rituals there. During the chaos of the Five Dynasties, the abbey fell into ruin. In the early Song dynasty, it was revived, and male Daoist priests were appointed to reside there. Statues of the Celestial Master and Miaoxing were enshrined in the abbey. Today, it is known as *Zhenfu Guan*, located in Fengxin County of Longxing Prefecture.\n\n**Gou Xiangu**\nGou Xiangu, a native of Changsha, entered the Dao and resided on Mount Heng. Though over eighty years old, her complexion remained youthful. For over a decade, she secluded herself at the Immortal Altar of Lady Wei of Nanyue, tending incense in solitude. Tigers and wolves roamed near the altar, and ordinary travelers dared not approach without forming groups and carrying weapons. Yet Xiangu dwelled there in deep seclusion, utterly unafraid.",

It spoke, saying: \"I am a messenger of the Lady of Nanyue. As you, Madam, have cultivated the Dao with such diligence and solitude in these remote woods, she has sent me to keep you company.\" Another day, it said: \"The Queen Mother of the West, surnamed Wei, is your sacred ancestor. Having heard of your devoted cultivation, she will soon send a perfected official to transmit the Dao to you—though the time has not yet come. You must redouble your efforts in practice.\"\n\nWhenever travelers came to the mountain, the blue-black bird would foretell their names and surnames, and on the appointed day, each prediction proved true. It also said: \"Mount Wangmu in Houshan, Henan, where the Queen Mother cultivated the Dao, is the mountain of your homeland.\" One day, the bird flew to her and said: \"Tonight, violent intruders will come. Do not be afraid.\"\n\nThat evening, more than ten men arrived. The Immortal Altar of Lady Wei was a massive slab of stone, roughly a *zhang* square, resting precariously atop another rock. If one person pushed it, the stone would sway, but with many hands, it stood firm. That night, the men came bearing torches, staves, and blades, intending to harm Xiangu. They entered her chamber, but she was upon the ridge and unseen. As they left, they tried to topple the altar, and with a thunderous crash, the mountain trembled and the valley split—yet the stone remained unmoved. Terrified, they fled in disarray. By dawn, those who had scattered to distant villages were torn apart by tigers, nine in all. Only one, who had not joined in the destruction, escaped the beasts' wrath. The altar stood unharmed, as if untouched.\n\nA year later, the blue-black bird told Xiangu to relocate. She moved to Hunan, and the bird followed, though others never heard its speech. Zheng Tian, Duke Wenzhao and former Grand Councilor of the Tang, had once served as Prefect of Wuzhou and studied under her while he was still a Hanlin Academician. Xiangu said to Duke Wenzhao: \"The realm will soon face great turmoil, and the human world will be unfit for long dwelling. I shall seek seclusion at Mount Jiuyi.\" One day, she departed.

At five, she could recite the *Huangting Jing*. As she grew, she dreamed of crossing waters and ascending mountains, where she beheld palaces of gold and silver—clouds revealed them to be Mount Fangzhang. Dozens of female immortals appeared; one said, \"Magu has chosen you as her sister,\" and taught her several *pipa* melodies. Thereafter, they met every few nights, and in over a year, she mastered over a hundred pieces. The most remarkable was *Single-Finger Shang*, played with but one finger. Later, Magu appeared in a dream, saying, \"I shall soon summon you.\" The next day, clouds, cranes, and celestial music filled the courtyard, and the girl passed away in an instant.\n\n*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao, Scroll Four (concluded)*\n*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao, Later Scroll Five*\n\n**The Jade Maiden of the Radiant Star**\nThe Jade Maiden of the Radiant Star dwelled on Mount Hua, partaking of jade nectar, and ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

There, Zheng Jiaofu encountered them and was captivated, unaware they were divine beings.

Turning back, the two women had vanished without a trace.\n\nA poem says:\n*By the Han there are wandering maidens,*\n*Yet they cannot be sought.*\nThis is what it means.\n\nFrom *The Biographies of Transcendents*.\n\n**The Supreme Mystery Woman**\nThe Supreme Mystery Woman, surnamed Zhuan and named He, lost her father in youth. Someone divined that neither she nor her mother would live long, which grieved her deeply. She often said: \"In this world, a single misstep cannot be undone, and death cannot be reversed. The brevity of life’s span can only be extended through cultivating the Dao.\" Thereupon, she sought out an enlightened master, purified her heart, and pursued the Way.\n\nShe obtained the arts of the Jade Child and practiced them for years, eventually gaining the ability to enter water without getting wet. Even in the depths of winter, clad in a single garment upon the water’s surface, her complexion remained unchanged, and her body stayed warm for days on end. She could also relocate government offices, palaces, cities, and houses to other places—appearing no different to the eye, yet vanishing at a gesture. Any locked doors, chests, or cabinets in her presence would open at her command. With a point of her finger, mountains crumbled and trees snapped, yet when she pointed again, they returned to their original state.\n\nWhen traveling with disciples, no matter which mountain they reached, she would strike a stone with her staff at dusk, and a door would open. Entering, they found chambers furnished with tables and chairs, curtains and bedding, kitchens and storerooms—all provided with food and drink as usual. Though they journeyed thousands of miles, this was always the case. She could make small things suddenly grow large, and large things shrink. At times, she would exhale fire that filled the sky, only to extinguish it with a single breath. She could sit amidst flames without her clothes burning. In an instant, she might transform into an old man, a child, or a carriage and horses, riding in and out at will. Her thirty-six arts were renowned.\n\nShe revived the dead and saved countless lives. No one knew what she consumed, nor could anyone obtain her arts. Her complexion grew ever more youthful, her hair as dark as a crow’s. Later, she ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\n**The Maiden of West River**\nThe Maiden of West River was the niece of the transcendent Boshanfu. Boshanfu, a native of Yongzhou, entered Mount Hua to study the Dao, refining his thoughts and ingesting elixirs. From time to time, he returned to his hometown to visit his family.

When the girl took the remedy, she was already seventy years old, yet gradually she grew younger, her complexion like peach blossoms. Later, a Han envoy passing through West River witnessed a woman at the eastern edge of the city flogging an old man with white hair, who knelt to receive the blows. The envoy found this strange and asked why. The woman replied, \"This is my son. Long ago, my uncle Boshanfu attained the Dao of immortals and secluded himself on Mount Hua. Taking pity on my many ailments, he gave me divine medicine, and I slowly regained my youthful appearance. But this son of mine refused to take the remedy, and so has grown decrepit, unable to keep pace with me. I am vexed by this, and thus I punish him with the rod.\" The envoy asked the ages of the woman and her son. She answered, \"I am one hundred and ten years old, and my son is seventy.\" Soon after, the woman entered Mount Hua.\n\n**The Wife of Yuan Ke**\nThe wife of Yuan Ke was a divine maiden. Yuan Ke was a man of Jiyin County, handsome in appearance, and though many in the village wished to marry their daughters to him, he never took a wife. He often gathered five-colored fragrant herbs, accumulating them for decades, consuming their fruits. One day, five-colored moths alighted upon the herbs. Yuan Ke collected them and placed them among mulberry leaves to cultivate silkworms. When the time for silkworms came, a woman arrived at night, calling herself Yuan Ke’s wife. She explained the state of the silkworms and helped him raise them, feeding them with fragrant herbs. Together, they harvested one hundred and twenty cocoons, each as large as an urn. Unwinding a single cocoon took sixty days. When the task was complete, they both departed, and no one knew where they had gone. Thus, the people of Jiyin established a shrine to the silkworm, building a temple in her honor. Some say she was from the Jiyang family of Chenliu.\n\n**The Wife of Cheng Wei**\nThe wife of Cheng Wei, an Expectant Appointee of the Han, was one who had attained the Dao. She possessed divine transformations, though Cheng Wei did not hold her in great esteem. Once, when he was to accompany the imperial procession, he lacked the proper attire and was deeply troubled. His wife said, \"It is only the lack of clothing that worries you so?\" She then produced two bolts of fine silk, which suddenly appeared. Cheng Wei was fond of alchemical arts but had long failed in his attempts. His wife took a small amount of medicine from her pouch, placed mercury in a vessel, added the medicine, and heated it. In an instant, it turned to silver. When Cheng Wei sought the method from her, she refused, saying his bones were not yet fit to receive it. Pressed beyond endurance, his wife suddenly transformed, her body dissolving as she departed.\n\n**Zhang Jiangzi**\nZhang Jiangzi was the younger sister of Zhang Ji of Western Shu.

Yet from the age of ten, Qi Xiāoyáo was of a serene and indifferent disposition, eschewing childish play and harboring a heart inclined toward the Dao. Her parents, aware of this, often performed hidden acts of virtue for others. When her father sought to instruct her in womanly duties, Xiāoyáo perused the texts and said, “These are but the affairs of ordinary folk.” She then took up the *Scriptures of the Divine Laozi*, reciting them without cease. When she reached marriageable age, matchmakers came to her home, but upon hearing of her ways, deemed it inauspicious. By twenty, her parents betrothed her to a family in the same village who tilled and wove for a living.\n\nHer in-laws were harsh and severe, demanding she tend to silkworms and farming without idleness. Yet Xiāoyáo devoted herself to purity and fasting from dawn to dusk, paying no heed to household affairs. Her husband, Jì Xún, reproached her repeatedly. Xiāoyáo addressed her in-laws, requesting to return home, and her parents, too, compelled her to go back. Thereupon, declaring her inability to attend to worldly matters, she wished to dwell alone in a quiet chamber to cultivate the Dao and thus provide for her in-laws. Jì Xún and her parents, both harboring suspicions, confined her to a room.\n\nXiāoyáo sustained herself only with fragrant water, fasting and meditating in stillness.

      "translated_text": "**He the Immortal Maiden**\n\nHe the Immortal Maiden was the daughter of He Tai of Zengcheng County, Guangzhou. During the reign of Empress Wu Zetian of the Tang, she dwelt by Yunmu Creek. At fourteen or fifteen, she dreamed one night that a divine being instructed her to consume yunmu powder, which would grant her a light body and immortality. She partook of it and vowed never to marry. Often she roamed the mountaintops, her movements swift as flight. Each morning she would depart, returning at dusk with mountain fruits for her mother. Later, she ceased eating grain, and her speech grew strange. The Empress dispatched envoys to summon her to court, but she vanished en route.\n\nThe *Record of the Meeting Immortals Abbey in Guangzhou* states: He the Immortal Maiden resided there, consuming yunmu powder, and ascended to immortality in broad daylight during the Jinglong era of Emperor Zhongzong. By the ninth year of the Tianbao era under Emperor Xuanzong, during a communal feast at Duxu Abbey, five-colored clouds arose above the Altar of Ma Gu, witnessed by all. An immortal maiden emerged in ethereal form, and the Daoist Cai Tianyi recognized her as He the Immortal Maiden. During the Dali era of Emperor Daizong, she reappeared at Small Stone Tower, and the prefect of Guangzhou, Gao Yun, reported the matter to the court.\n\n---\n\n**Xie Ziran**\n\nXie Ziran, a female perfected one from Huayang in Shu, was gifted by nature and entered the Dao in her youth. Her master presented her with the *Scriptures of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi*, which she read once as if revisiting an old text, and twice to commit it to memory. As she matured, her spirit and qi grew pure and luminous, her words and bearing surpassing the ordinary. She loved the qin and books, excelled in calligraphy, and composed literature. She disdained the conduct of Zhuo Wenjun. Often she burned incense and prayed to the Queen Mother of the West and Ma Gu, admiring the integrity of Lady Wei of South Mountain.\n\nAt forty, she set out on distant travels, visiting Qingcheng, Damei, Emei, the Thirty-Six Quiet Abodes, and the Twenty-Four Grotto-Heavens. Leaving Shu, she journeyed through the capital and Luoyang, reaching the Jiang and Huai regions. Wherever there were renowned mountains, grotto-heavens, or sacred sites, she spared no effort to explore them. Later, hearing that the Daoist Sima Chengzhen of Tiantai resided on Jade Cloud Peak, a man of lofty virtue, she sought him out. For three years, she served as his disciple, dwelling apart in the mountains, gathering firewood daily for him before returning. She also brought incense and fruit, earnestly seeking instruction.\n\nChengzhen marveled at her perseverance, saying, “I possess no virtue or power—how can I bear this? Yet what do you seek?” Ziran replied, “From a thousand miles away, I came to your door to attain the Way of transcending the world. I seek only the transmission of the highest teachings to achieve liberation—nothing more.” Chengzhen, considering that the highest methods were rarely passed to female perfected ones, feared profaning the great Dao and merely assented.\n\nAfter more than a year, Ziran sighed, “If no enlightened master accepts me, is this not my fate?” Each time she ascended Jade Cloud Peak, she beheld Penglai across the sea, seemingly not far, yet among mortals, she feared no master could be found. Thus, she bid Chengzhen farewell, declaring her intent to journey to Penglai. She sold all her belongings, donned plain robes, and ceased eating grain. Taking only a mat, she cast herself into the sea and drifted upon the waves. A Silla ship spotted her and took her aboard.\n\nAfter several days at sea, she saw only azure waters. At sunset, distant waves surged, and phosphorescent fires stretched to the horizon, the ship sailing through flames. A year later, the wind carried the vessel into waters black as ink, then white as powder, then shimmering like pearls, and finally yellow as sulfur. Suddenly, the wind shifted, and the ship was cast into a bay. There stood a mountain, its sunlight golden, with fragrant grasses, mist, beasts, and birds—all of a yellow hue. The crew disembarked and climbed the mountain, finding it composed entirely of sulfur. The merchants hastily discarded their other goods and loaded the ship with the stones.\n\nAfter passing through the four colored waters, each taking three to five days and nights, the wind and sails carried them without measure of distance. A month later, another crosswind arose, and the sailors grew anxious, fearing for their lives. Suddenly, a great mountain surged from the sea, its summit lined with over a thousand red banners. The helmsman declared it the dorsal fin of a whale. Then, under clear skies, a column of vapor rose over a hundred *zhang* high, accompanied by a tempest—this was the whale’s breath.\n\nAmidst such sights—sea people, monstrous beasts, and spirits in myriad forms—Ziran burned incense, praying to Penglai. In an instant, they reached a mountain where forests, flowers, and birds thrived in misty springtime. The helmsman climbed ashore and saw many houses and people. Ziran asked, “Is this not an immortal mountain?” The helmsman replied, “Those aboard may disembark to rest until the wind favors us.”\n\nSoon, all climbed the mountain and scattered, but Ziran wandered alone. Several Daoists appeared, their attendants in blue robes, the wind through the trees chiming like metal and stone. The fragrance of flowers and herbs permeated her to the bone. Azure luan birds, frost cranes, green parrots, and five-colored dogs roamed the courtyards. Among them stood one adorned in a floral crown and rosy robes, their countenance refined and beautiful. A blue-robed attendant led Ziran to them.\n\n“I seek a master in Penglai to transmit the Way of liberation,” she said. The Daoist smiled, “Penglai lies beyond the Weak Waters, three hundred thousand *li* away. No ship can reach it, nor can any but flying immortals arrive. Sima Chengzhen of Tiantai Mountain, whose name is inscribed on the Cinnabar Terrace and who dwells in the Red City, is a true and worthy master. You should return to him.”\n\nMoments later, the wind rose, and the helmsman urged all to board, declaring the wind favorable. As they set sail, another crosswind carried them for three days before they reached the shores of Taizhou. Overjoyed, Ziran returned to Tiantai and recounted all to Chengzhen, apologizing for her past transgressions. Chengzhen said, “Wait until an auspicious day, when I shall ascend the altar to transmit the teachings.”\n\nThus, he bestowed upon her the methods of the Highest Clarity. Later, she returned to Shu and completed her cultivation on Golden Spring Mountain in Nanchong County, Guozhou. On the sixteenth day of the tenth month in the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era of Emperor Dezong (794), Lord Lao commanded her summons, and she ascended to immortality in broad daylight.",

      "translated_text": "The Military Commissioner Wei Gao memorialized the event to the imperial court.\n\nAnother account states that when Xie Ziran was about to ascend to heaven, she wrote on the eastern wall of her hall: “I leave this message to all my kin: do not grieve or suffer. Instead, diligently cultivate virtue and power, establish fields of blessings, maintain purity, and recite the Dao. After a hundred kalpas, may we meet again in the realm of the Pure Source.”\n\nHer writing remains preserved to this day. Three days after her ascension, she descended from heaven once more and spoke to Prefect Li Jian, saying, “In the heavens stands the loftiest Jade Hall, where Lord Lao resides. Its walls are of white jade, inscribed above with the names of immortals in gold. At times, vermilion script appears beneath, noting those who descend to become emperors or chief ministers. Whenever immortals pay homage to Lord Lao, they bow four times. Fearing that mortals would not believe in the existence of immortals, I have come briefly to tell you this.” Having spoken, she ascended to heaven again. Li Jian reported the matter in a memorial, and an imperial edict was issued in praise.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Eastern Extremity, Bai Ziqing, declared: “Xie Ziran is now the Perfected One of the Eastern Extremity.”\n\nAs for the Lady Wang—she was the wife of Xie Liangbi, a Drafter in the Imperial Secretariat. A descendant of Wang Xizhi, the Right General of the Eastern Jin, she hailed from Kuaiji. Liangbi, having passed the imperial examinations, served as an Attendant in the Eastern Zhe Circuit before marrying her. A year later, Liangbi was summoned to the capital at Chang’an, where he rose through the ranks to become Drafter in the Imperial Secretariat.\n\nFrom childhood, Lady Wang was devoted to the Dao and often recited the *Scripture of the Yellow Court*. While Liangbi was away, she fell gravely ill, and her condition only worsened. At that time, the Celestial Master Wu Jun was traveling through Siming, Tiantai, Lanting, and the Grotto of Yu, halting his staff in Shanyin. Lady Wang’s family sought his aid, and through his methods—drinking consecrated water and swallowing talismans—she recovered after two nights.\n\nGrateful for the saving power of the Dao, she sought initiation from the Celestial Master. She cultivated with diligence, burning incense in seclusion, her mind fixed on stillness, her aspirations set on ascension. She ceased taking grain, swallowing qi instead, and her spirit harmonized as her body grew light. At times, rare fragrances and auspicious clouds would gather above her residence. Immortals descended in secret, their hairpins scattering, and she communed with the divine, though none knew it.\n\nOne day, she suddenly said to her maidservant, “The illness I suffered for nearly a decade was cured by the Celestial Master, who prolonged my exhausted fate. Yet my awakening to the Dao came late, and my cultivation remains imperfect. My past transgressions weigh upon me, and my repentance is incomplete. All my life, I harbored worldly resentments, my heart closed and dark, obstructing the Dao. I must now refine my form in the hidden light and purify my heart to transform my inner nature. Only after twenty years will I shed this mortal coil.”\n\nWhen she died that evening, her family followed her instructions: they used no coffin but fashioned a wooden canopy, placing her body in the wilderness and appointing someone to check on it periodically. All was done with simplicity. Laid in the garden, she appeared as if merely asleep, her form unchanged.\n\nTwenty years later, thieves broke into the burial site, and her body fell to the ground. In the depths of winter, a thunderous crash suddenly resounded beside the canopy. Her family rushed to investigate and, lifting her body, found it light as an empty husk, yet with skin, flesh, nails, and hair all intact. On her right side was a fissure over a foot long. They gathered her remains once more.",

The next day, he inquired after her, and Ma Ao asked, “Would you like to meet her?” Lu Qi assented. Ma Ao replied, “Very well.” Three days later, he saw resplendent towers and carriages descending from the sky—it was the same girl. She said to Lu Qi, “Come again in seven days.” She then called Ma Ao and handed her two medicinal pellets, instructing her to plant them in the ground. In an instant, two gourds sprouted, growing swiftly to the size of jars. Ma Ao split them open with a blade, and she and Lu Qi each entered one. Suddenly, wind and clouds arose, lifting them into the azure heavens.\n\nLu Qi asked Ma Ao, “How far is it from here to Luoyang?” She replied, “Eighty thousand *li*.” After some time, palaces appeared atop the gourd, their walls of crystal. The girl resided in the central hall, surrounded by hundreds of attendants, while Ma Ao stood among the guards below. The girl bade Lu Qi sit and served him wine and food, saying, “Sir, you may choose one of three fates: first, remain here as an official, with a lifespan equal to heaven’s; second, become an earthbound immortal, free to visit this place at will; or third, return to the human realm as a chancellor.” Lu Qi replied, “To stay here is my greatest wish.” The girl rejoiced, saying, “This is the Crystal Palace. I am the Lady of Grand Yin, and my immortal rank is already exalted. If you dwell here, you shall ascend in broad daylight.” She then drafted a memorial to the Celestial Emperor.\n\nSoon after, a crimson-robed messenger proclaimed the Emperor’s decree: “Does Lu Qi wish to reside in the Crystal Palace? To become an earthbound immortal? Or to return as a chancellor in the human realm?” Lu Qi answered, “I choose to be a chancellor in the human realm.” The crimson-robed messenger hurried him out, and the Lady of Grand Yin paled in dismay.

      "translated_text": "She also crafted a *Flying Immortal Canopy*, weaving a single strand of silk into five layers, within which lay the Ten Continents and Three Isles. Each day, she consumed no more than two or three *ge* of sesame rice. Emperor Xianzong, admiring her intelligence and extraordinary skill, bestowed upon her a golden phoenix bracelet to adorn her wrist. Knowing that Meiniang did not wish to remain in the palace, he ordained her as a Daoist nun, allowing her to return to the Southern Seas, and granted her the title *Master of Carefree Wandering*. Later, when her spirit departed, the room filled with fragrance. As her disciples prepared for burial, they found the coffin strangely light; upon removing its lid, only a pair of lotus slippers remained.\n\nThereafter, some claimed to have seen Meiniang riding purple clouds over the sea. At the time, the recluse Li Xiangxian of Luofu composed *The Tale of Lu the Carefree*.\n\nWu Cailuan\nIn the final years of Emperor Wenzong’s Taihe era, a scholar named Wen Xiao, a wanderer with no home, drifted like duckweed to Zhongling Prefecture. Xiao was refined in temperament and devoted to the Dao, his appearance pure and transcendent. He befriended the Daoist priest Liu Qiqian of the Purple Ultimate Palace and resided there for three or four years.\n\nWest of Zhongling lay the *Wandering Canopy Abbey*, the former abode of the Perfected Lord Xu, who had ascended to immortality. Each year on the anniversary of his ascension, people from Wu, Shu, Chu, and Yue traveled thousands of *li* to gather there, bearing rare incense, precious fruits, silk brocades, and gold coins, offering vegetarian feasts and rituals to pray for blessings. The crowds at Zhongling numbered in the tens of thousands, with carriages and horses clamoring, men and women thronging shoulder to shoulder, dancing and singing in linked arms.\n\nXiao went to observe the festivities and noticed a young woman whose singing stood apart. Her lyrics were refined and otherworldly, harmonizing with realms beyond the mortal. When he heard a verse containing the words *Wen Xiao* and *Cailuan*, he startled: *\"Is this an omen of my name? She must be a companion of the immortals.\"* He stood rooted, unable to leave. Inquiring among the bystanders, some said: *\"She is a servant girl from Hongjing, living near Hongya Altar. But no one knows her true origins.\"*\n\nBy the time her song ended, it was already the fourth watch. The young woman bade farewell to her companions and, holding a candle, traversed a path through towering pines, climbing the mountain by touch, braving perilous heights. Xiao secretly followed her trail. As her candle neared its end, several immortal youths emerged bearing pine torches to welcome her. Xiao gasped, and the young woman turned, questioning: *\"Are you not Wen Xiao?\"* He replied: *\"Yes.\"* She said: *\"Our fated numbers do not align—why have you come here?\"* Leading him to the summit, she was met with strict attendants, a table draped in silk, a golden censer burning foreign incense. After they sat, two immortal maidens approached with ledgers, their inquiries mostly concerning the drowning of travelers in rivers and lakes.\n\nWhen a woman’s name appeared, the young woman seemed displeased. Another entry mentioned a storm on Cang Lake that had accidentally claimed the lives of children. She grew angry: *\"How could such a mistake be made?\"* Holding the register, she said: *\"The infants’ qi was too weak—they could not endure it. We did not fail to save them; there was simply nothing to be done.\"* Xiao, hearing this, pressed her for details, but she refused to answer. When he insisted, she replied: *\"These are secrets of the unseen realm, not meant for your ears. If I reveal them, we will both suffer calamity.\"*\n\nThe immortal maidens departed with the ledgers, and suddenly the sky darkened, wind and thunder raged, tearing the curtains and overturning the table. Xiao, terrified, dared not look. The young woman hastily dressed, took up a ritual tablet, and knelt in reverence, awaiting punishment. Soon, the storm subsided, the stars reappeared, and an immortal youth descended from the heavens, holding a celestial decree: *\"Wu Cailuan, for yielding to personal desire and divulging heavenly secrets, is demoted to the mortal realm as a wife for twelve years.\"* She wept, then descended the mountain with Xiao. They married and returned to Zhongling, settling in Xiao’s former dwelling.\n\nOnly then did Xiao learn her name. When he asked about her lineage, she said: *\"My father was the Immortal Lord Wu, named Meng, from Yuzhang. His deeds are recorded in the *Book of Jin*. He aided people and rectified the Dao, and now serves as an immortal official, his name inscribed in the grotto heavens. I have managed the registers of the unseen for six hundred years, but for some unknown offense, I was suddenly demoted. Yet through me, you too may transcend this world.\"*\n\nXiao lived in poverty, unable to support himself. Cailuan transcribed the *Book of Sun Simiao* daily, her brush moving like the wind. Each completed copy sold for five *jin* of gold; when the money was spent, she would transcribe another. For nearly a decade, few knew of this, until the second year of Emperor Wuzong’s Huichang era. Then, she and Xiao secretly moved to Xinwu County, beside Mount Yuewang in the village of Zou Ju. There, they taught dozens of children.\n\nOne night, two tigers roared outside their courtyard. At dawn, the couple had vanished. At daybreak, a woodcutter descending Mount Yuewang saw them each riding a tiger, moving as swiftly as the wind, vanishing among the peaks.\n\nDu Lanxiang\nA fisherman on the Xiang River found a three-year-old girl on the shores of Dongting Lake and, taking pity on her, raised her for over a decade. Her appearance was extraordinary, her bearing uncommon. Suddenly, a celestial youth descended from the sky and carried her away. Before leaving, she told her foster father: *\"I am the immortal Du Lanxiang. I cannot return home now, but later I will descend to the household of Zhang Shuo at Dongting.\"*\n\nZhang was a cultivator of the Dao. When Lanxiang first descended, she bestowed upon him a jade tablet, a jade spittoon, and a red cloth for ritual purification, as tokens of his ascent to immortality. One evening, she ordered her attendants to present Zhang with a robe woven from yellow *lin* feathers, saying: *\"This is the raiment of the highest immortals.\"*\n\nThe Zhuge Clan\nOn Mount Jiuhua, the wife of a woodcutter, née Zhuge, fell ill several times. One day, she told her parents-in-law: *\"My illness will not only be cured—I will also attain immortality.\"* Soon after, she walked out the door and ascended into the sky.",

From childhood, she was keenly perceptive and unmatched in skill. She could embroider the *Lotus Sutra* upon a foot-long silk ribbon, each character no larger than a grain of millet.",

      "translated_text": "A few days later, she descended again, saying: *\"In the celestial palaces above, the towers and pavilions are all carved from green jade, their windows adorned. The curtains and drapes are strung with pearls and gems, woven with threads of dragon silk, their five hues shimmering in radiance. As immortal maidens walk through their luminous midst, the fragrance of deathless incense lingers. I have come but briefly to see you.\"* Soon after, a five-colored chariot arrived, drawn by twin dragons and driven by mighty immortals, with jade maidens in attendance. The woman mounted it and drifted slowly away.\n\n**The Weaver Girl**\nZheng Delin of Changsha was traveling to Jiangxia to visit his parents. On his return journey, he lodged at Dongting Lake alongside a merchant named Wei. A young woman of the Wei household was fishing from a waterside pavilion. Delin inscribed a poem on a strip of red silk and cast it to her:\n\n*\"Slender hands dangle the hook by the water’s pane,\nCrimson reflections vie with autumn’s Yangtze glow.\nSince you unclasped your girdle for Jiao Fu of old,\nMight I beg a pair of luminous pearls as well?\"*\n\nThe girl, charmed by the red silk, reeled it in. At dawn, Delin hoisted his sails and departed with the wind. As dusk fell, a fisherman reported: *\"A merchant’s great vessel has sunk in Dongting.\"* Grief-stricken, Delin composed an elegy for his *\"River Sister\"*:\n\n*\"Soft winds stir the autumn reeds on Dongting’s tide,\nA drowned maiden’s sorrow swirls in rippling waves.\nHave you not seen the white duckweed’s tears?\nBeneath the moon, the river’s gentle gulls take flight.\"*\n\nHe poured libations into the water and cast the poem after them. The river god conveyed it to the water palace, where the Lord of the Waters declared: *\"Delin shall one day be a wise magistrate of our domain.\"* He summoned his steward to deliver the Wei girl to Zheng. When she beheld the palace lord, she saw only an old man.\n\nThat night, Delin felt something strike his boat. He hauled it aboard—it was the Wei girl. He took her as his wife. Years later, he indeed became magistrate of Baling. Upon arriving at Dongting, an old man appeared and said: *\"Long ago, the water palace spared your life.\"* The Wei girl bowed and asked: *\"My parents dwell in the water palace—may I visit them?\"* *\"You may,\"* he replied.\n\nIn an instant, the boat sank, yet they felt no discomfort. Their parents’ dwelling was no different from an ordinary home, and all the objects lost in the drowning had gathered there.

      "translated_text": "The Daoist nun Yang Baozong was of unknown origin. From childhood, she was bright and refined, and when she came of age, she was betrothed. Suddenly, she experienced a profound awakening and begged to become a Daoist. Her parents consented. She entered Mount Lu, dwelling at Chongshan Abbey atop Xiaoxiao Peak. There, she utterly forgot worldly concerns and attained the source of purity and stillness. She practiced grain avoidance and bodily refinement with diligence, and her teachings spread far and wide, greatly reviving the mystic Dao.\n\nEmperor Yuanzong of Southern Tang, having heard of her, summoned her to court with an imperial edict and received her in the palace, arranging for the consorts and concubines who delighted in the Dao to meet her. When asked what she desired, Baozong spoke of the abbey’s dilapidated halls, unable to accommodate the many disciples. The emperor then commanded that gold and coin be bestowed upon her, while the six palaces vied to offer gifts—pearl-embroidered robes and fine silks—amounting to over ten million in value. He ordered the abbey’s halls to be renovated, and had Han Xizai, a gentleman of the Ministry of Rites, compose an inscription. The abbey was granted the name *Zhenfeng* (\"True Dao\"), and Baozong herself was bestowed with purple robes.\n\nThe emperor further commanded his ministers to compose poems in her honor as she departed, all to honor the Dao. Baozong had long admired the character of Cai Xunzhen and Li Tengkong, and like them, she used elixirs, talismans, and scriptures to relieve the suffering of others. In her leisure, she would travel north and south of the folding screens, paying homage at the two shrines.\n\nThough Baozong grew old in years, her complexion remained like that of a child. After her death, her countenance appeared as in life, and her coffin was remarkably light—people believed she had undergone *shijie* (liberation from the corpse). Previously, Chongshan Abbey had been founded in the early Datong era of Emperor Wu of Liang, and for four hundred years thereafter, no eminent figures or lofty scholars had been heard of there. Only with Baozong’s far-reaching reputation did disciples gather in great numbers, and the Daoist community flourished. (Author unknown)",

He served as Assistant Magistrate in Haozhou and died of illness while in office. Wang Ning’s family had long been poor, and his only son was still young. His wife, Lady Li, carried their child in her arms and bore his remains on her back to return home. Traveling eastward, they passed through Kaifeng and stopped at an inn, but the innkeeper refused them lodging. As Lady Li looked up at the darkening sky, she refused to leave. The innkeeper seized her arm and dragged her out. Raising her face to heaven, she wailed, “I am but a woman—unable to preserve my chastity, yet must this hand be grasped by another?” She then took up an axe and severed her own arm. All who witnessed this wept in sorrow. The Prefect of Kaifeng, upon hearing of the incident, reported it to the court.

      "translated_text": "The Qian Sisters of Perfected Truth\n\nThe two sisters of the Qian clan, both Perfected Truth practitioners, resided in seclusion reciting the *Yellow Court Scripture* at Swallow Grotto on Mount Mao. To this day, green peach trees and purple caltrop grow there. The elder sister soon donned a white silk robe and attained the Dao, entering the grotto. By the time the younger sister arrived, the grotto had already sealed itself. In the fifth year of Chunhua during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Song, Inspector Xiahou Jiazhen and five Daoist priests from Jianlong arrived to perform the Dragon Offering ritual. That night, thunder shook the earth, and the grotto reopened, its depth unfathomable. A clerk from the prefectural office ventured deep inside and encountered a Daoist who handed him a single lychee. After eating it, he no longer required grain. A poem by Tian Lin was inscribed on a board there:\n\n*At Swallow’s Mouth, the dragon pool’s clear mien,*\n*The Qian sisters’ lingering spirit remains unseen.*\n*Though the elder left, her traces still reside,*\n*When the younger returned, the grotto’s gate stood wide.*\n*Clouds drift like flying white silk’s trace,*\n*The spring’s murmur echoes the Yellow Court’s grace.*\n*Green peach blooms, purple caltrop gleams,*\n*Left for mortals to ponder in waking dreams.*\n\nCao Wenji\n\nCao Wenji was originally a courtesan from Chang’an. At four or five years old, she displayed a prodigious talent for literature and play, grasping the profound meaning of any book she read. People suspected she had cultivated this in a past life. As she matured, her beauty became unparalleled, and she excelled in calligraphy. Beyond drafting memorials, she inscribed every surface—silken curtains, windows—wherever her brush could reach, writing tens of thousands of characters daily. People called her the \"Calligraphy Immortal.\" Her brushwork was unrivaled in Guanzhong. Even renowned calligraphers like Zhou Langzhong of Yue and Ma Jiancha of the Imperial Censorate praised her endlessly upon seeing her work.\n\nHer family urged her to learn music, but she said, \"Such trivial arts—how could I delight in them? Only the inkstone’s pool and the brush’s tomb would bring me contentment in old age.\" Thus, her fame spread, and countless men of wealth and talent offered gold and jade to make her their companion. She replied, \"None of them are my match. Whoever wishes to be my partner must first submit a poem, and I shall choose for myself.\"\n\nFrom then on, hundreds of poems—long verses and short, exquisite lines—arrived daily, but none moved her. Then Ren, a scholar from Minshan visiting Chang’an, heard of her and rejoiced, saying, \"I have found my match.\" When asked how he knew, he replied, \"The phoenix perches in the parasol tree, the fish leaps in the deep—each finds its rightful place.\" He submitted a poem:\n\n*Before the Jade Emperor’s hall, a scribe divine,*\n*Once tainted by worldly dust, exiled from heaven’s shrine.*\n*No wonder fragrant flesh must cling to bone,*\n*For her cloud-robes once brushed the incense-throne.*\n\nUpon reading it, Wenji exclaimed, \"This is truly my husband! How else would he know my past?\" She vowed to serve him and begged him not to look elsewhere. Her family could not dissuade her, and they became husband and wife. From then on, through spring mornings and autumn evenings, they shared poems and wine, savoring each fleeting moment.\n\nFive years passed. On the last day of the third month, as they drank to bid farewell to spring, Wenji inscribed a poem:\n\n*In immortals’ realm, no summer, no fall,*\n*Red sun and clear wind fill the jade hall.*\n*If the tiled roof holds a path to the azure sky,*\n*Might we ride the five-colored rainbow on high?*\n\nAfter writing, she sighed, \"I was once a celestial scribe in the heavens, banished to the mortal world for two decades due to earthly attachments.\" Turning to Ren, she said, \"You, too, were once an immortal who attained the Dao, now exiled among men. I share a karmic bond with you, which is why I entrusted myself to you. Today, we shall depart together.\"\n\nSuddenly, celestial music filled the air, and an otherworldly fragrance permeated the room. The household, astonished, peered in and saw a crimson-robed official descending with a jade tablet inscribed in vermilion seal script: *\"Li Changji has newly composed* The Jade Tower Record*. The Heavenly Emperor summons you to inscribe the stele. Hasten your ascent without delay.\"*\n\nThe family protested, \"Li Changji was a poet of the Tang—three hundred years have passed! How can this be? It must be some trickery.\" Wenji smiled, \"This is beyond your understanding. Three hundred years in the mortal world are but a moment in the heavens.\" She and Ren changed into their celestial robes, bowed in reverence, and rose into the air. All saw clouds and mist shimmering, phoenixes and cranes swirling around them. Tens of thousands witnessed the spectacle. The place where they had lived was later named \"Calligraphy Immortal Lane.\" A record was inscribed in the fourth year of Qingli during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Song, the year *jiashen*.\n\nImmortal Maiden Zhao\n\nImmortal Maiden Zhao, whose given name was He, was a native of Lingling in Yongzhou. Her family lived in Zheng Prefecture. At twelve, while picking tea with a group, she wandered a few *li* and lost her companions. After walking another *li* or so, she came upon a ravine of extraordinary beauty—clear springs and smooth stones, flowers and trees intertwined, birds singing sweetly, mist and clouds drifting. A man walked among them, an extraordinary sight. He wore a star-embroidered cap and a robe of finest silk, smiling at her.\n\nThe maiden thought this a fitting place to dwell. She bowed and begged to be accepted as a disciple, offering to serve him. The bearded immortal said, \"You cannot stay here yet—you must be famished from your long journey.\" From his sleeve, he produced a peach and told her to eat it, adding, \"If you can finish it, you will one day ascend to the heavens. If not, you will remain on earth.\" She ate half and saved the other half to share with her family.\n\nThe immortal urged her to return quickly and not linger. When she arrived home, her mother and brother asked, \"Where have you been so long?\" To her surprise, a month had passed. From then on, she ate no grain, only fruit and water. She disliked speaking with ordinary people, sitting quietly all day in meditation. Her family, recognizing her difference, built a bamboo pavilion for her.\n\nOnly her brother and sister-in-law lived with her. At night, voices often echoed from her pavilion. One day, her brother climbed the pavilion to eavesdrop and saw the maiden speaking with a tall, bearded man—handsome, with star-embroidered cap and silk robe. She addressed him as \"Immortal Elder\" and said, \"You promised to visit the other day—why did you break your word?\"",

I had to cover thirteen hundred *li* over Pengli Marsh, bringing three *chi* of rain in a single night—no easy task in this scorching heat.

That is why I missed our appointment the other evening.\"\n\nAs he finished speaking, he added, \"Your brother and mother have overheard these celestial secrets.

They dwell on the Ten Isles and Three Mountains, in renowned caves and palaces, accumulating merit and cultivating conduct before they may rise. Some govern rivers and lakes, others oversee the netherworld, or preside over mountains and peaks. They bring benefit to all ages, remove harm from the world, heal the sick, dispel suffering, rescue the distressed, uphold the fallen, and aid the weak. Their hidden merits and secret virtues are manifold—no single deed can encompass them all. But immortals do not boast of their achievements; they fear being known, so mortals rarely learn of their deeds.\"\n\nHer brother asked, \"Then how are the merits and deeds of immortals recorded?\"\n\nThe maiden replied, \"There are immortal officials who oversee such matters. Each year, they record these deeds and present them to the Celestial Emperor, who then ranks them accordingly. Those with the highest merit advance in their immortal ranks.\"\n\nWhen Zhou Lianfu, the prefect of Daozhou, was relieved of his post and returned to the capital, he passed through Lingling.

      "translated_text": "In the territory of Renqiu County in Mozhou, there was a market called Tangluan, where fish piled high like a hill. During the Daguan era of Emperor Huizong of the Song, a poor girl of unknown origin often dwelled in an abandoned shrine. Each morning, she would enter the market to beg for fish, which she would then roast and devour raw—no other food was ever seen to pass her lips. If someone gave her clothing, she would slash it to pieces with a knife. Should anyone approach her, she would curse them, or even stab them with her blade, so that none dared come near. Yet her appearance was graceful and lovely, her skin smooth as congealed cream. A local soldier once conceived the intent to violate her, but suddenly saw a great serpent coiled where she sat. Terrified, he retreated, and when he looked back, the seat had transformed into a precious lotus blossom. The poor girl said, \"I cannot remain here.\" Soon after, she vanished without a trace.\n\n**Immortal Maiden Yu**\n\nImmortal Maiden Yu was a native of Fengxiang. Initially, her family’s livelihood depended on selling tea, and she lived in a place called the Chamber of Fasting and Reflection. Though born to a humble family, she cherished purity from a young age, abstaining from meat and reciting the *Book of Laozi* daily. When her parents gave her money, she would save it to purchase discarded slips of paper and broken bamboo tablets, which she stitched into clothing to give to beggars. Before long, she discovered among these scraps the Daoist teachings of *xu*, *he*, *yan*, *chui*, and *xi*. After practicing them for a long time, she ceased eating grain. At fourteen, she refused to marry. Neighboring girls who were fond of divine transcendents flocked to visit her.\n\nOne day, they discussed the Hua Mountains, where a stone chamber was said to contain a jade casket holding an elixir formula. Many had sought it, but none could open the casket—it was likely a treasure of the Upper Clarity, accessible only to those of the Dao. \"I observe that this girl of the Yu family,\" they said, \"has studied the Dao, refused marriage, and already mastered grain avoidance. Perhaps she can open the jade casket.\" They went to ask her, and she agreed. The girls waited nearby as she entered the chamber. There, she indeed found the jade casket and opened it, retrieving the *Great Cavern Scripture*. Fearing the others would seize it, she emerged and told them, \"It is true, but I cannot open it.\" The crowd departed in disappointment.\n\nImmortal Maiden Yu returned home and studied the scripture day and night, following its methods until she attained the art of transcending the world and refining her form. She could walk upon inked paper or remain sealed in an outer casket for months. When her disciples opened it, they found only dust. Then, Immortal Maiden Yu would slowly shake out her robes and rise.\n\nEmperor Huizong of the Song heard of her and summoned her to the eastern capital, bestowing upon her the title of Perfected and presenting her with a poem:\n\n*A songstress beyond the clouds of the Three Mountains,*\n*Her heart unstained by a speck of worldly dust.*\n\nIn the early Jingkang era of Emperor Qinzong, she told her disciples, \"I shall depart now, but I will return in sixty years.\" Soon after, she transformed. Her disciples followed her instructions, preparing a large coffin with openings on both sides and placing it in a valley of the Zhongnan Mountains. Word spread, and crowds came to gawk. After several months, Immortal Maiden Yu suddenly arose and said to her disciples, \"I warned you not to let the masses observe me. Why have you allowed this? Quickly dig a pit twenty feet deep and place my coffin within.\" Once the pit was dug, she entered the outer coffin and ordered them to seal it. \"Can the crowds disturb me now?\" she asked.\n\nIt is said that one Xiang Tuan later obtained her teachings.\n\n**Immortal Maiden Zhang**\n\nImmortal Maiden Zhang was a native of Nanyang. The circumstances of her attainment of the Dao remain unclear. When someone fell ill, she would sit opposite them, close her eyes, and silently project *qi* to attack the ailment. The afflicted would soon feel warmth spreading in their chest, their complexion flushing as if heated. Then, a rumbling sound like thunder would arise. Even those suffering from deep-seated illnesses invariably recovered. For this, she was revered and admired by many nobles of the time.",

      "translated_text": "At seventeen, she once invited her brother to journey to the Four Brightnesses in the Eastern Sea. While her brother rode in a boat, Chen Yuyu walked upon the water, and after several days, her clothes remained dry. Upon returning, she told others: \"In the water, I met the Lady Star Sovereign, who guided me to Penglai. Only then did I realize I was originally the thirteenth cave master.\" From that moment, she awakened, and thereafter abstained from grain. She became skilled in poetry and lyrics, and could foretell people’s fortunes and misfortunes. Nobles, officials, scholars, and commoners came daily to seek her counsel, filling the doorway with their shoes.\n\nIn the seventh year of Emperor Huizong of Song’s *Zhenghe* reign (1117), the prefect Liu An, along with the regional inspectors Lu Tianji and Wang Ruming, reported her to the court. She was summoned to the capital and bestowed the title *Miaojing Lianshi* (Master of Wondrous Stillness and Refinement). After her audience, she immediately begged to return to the mountains and was granted a palanquin for the journey. Her dwelling, where Guo Chongshi had once lived, faced Mount Ge the Immortal in front and rested against the Altar of the Immortal Maiden behind. She lived alone in a single chamber.\n\nDuring the *Zhenghe* era, the county magistrate He Tingjian presented her with a poem:\n*\"How many years have you dwelt in spirit, fasting from grain?*\n*Daylong behind closed doors, you sit in serene silence.*\n*In wordless pact with Ma Gu on the lofty peak,*\n*From the Basket Woman you received the wondrous Dao.*\n*Your merit and conduct transcend the Three Realms;*\n*Your name resounds, pure, through the Ninefold Heavens.*\n*Who might I ask of the Queen Mother of the West—*\n*Which in rank among Jinhua’s immortals is our master?\"*\n\nShe received many poems, but this was the one she favored.\n\nChen Yuyu composed thousands of poems before and after, many foretelling the fortunes and misfortunes of others. Her younger brother Zhao once asked: \"The verses you write—how is it their responses come so swiftly? How do you know these things?\" She replied: \"When I intone the name of a place, a celestial official arrives bearing a register. Five hundred years of past and future are all known to me. Fearing I might leak heavenly secrets, I couch my words in wind, flowers, snow, and moon, yet fortune and misfortune lie hidden within. Not only do I know these things—I also govern them. Formerly, I temporarily held the post of the Impermanent Constable, overseeing inquiries into life and death. Later, I temporarily held the post of the Yin Clerk, overseeing inquiries into the Six Transgressions: bribery of officials, the Five Inverses of unfilial conduct, licentiousness, theft, deceit, and wanton killing. Most people in the world incur these offenses, and thus many die from heavenly calamities. Those who avoid them may, within three generations, produce immortals. Recently, I have also been placed in charge of the Moon Terrace’s immortal registers. All those who are wise and perceptive are recorded therein. If they cultivate merit and conduct, they may become Moon Terrace immortals. In general, I exhort them to loyalty, filial piety, sincerity, and trustworthiness.

      "translated_text": "Those who inquired of her were told: \"The city is filled with black qi—you must leave at once.\" Within ten days, the disaster of the Jurchen invasion struck. The Perfected One’s skin was luminous and refined, her speech clear and pleasing to the ear. Though she never studied books, she answered all questions about past and present without hesitation. Later, she withdrew into seclusion on Mount Luofu in Huizhou.\n\n**Wu Yuanzhao**\n\nWu, the Perfected One, named Yuanzhao, was the daughter of a commoner from Xiaoshan in Kuaiji. While still in her mother’s arms, if her mother ate meat, she would refuse the breast all day, yet if her mother ate vegetables, she would nurse as before. Her mother found this strange and suspected something unusual. As she grew older, her family arranged a marriage to a wealthy man in the county. After accepting the betrothal gifts, she became sullen and dispirited. When instructed in women’s work, she would sit and doze off. Her mother beat her, and she apologized, saying: \"I dare not be lazy. Last night, a deity in golden armor told me that the Earth Goddess had summoned me. I went with him into the clouds, arriving at the vast palace beneath the Azure Sky. There, I saw lofty immortals seated upon the dais, with jade maidens standing in attendance. They called me to ascend and warned: 'You were once a jade maiden, but due to past transgressions, you were temporarily banished to the mortal world for thirty years. Now you have returned. Go back, abstain from grain, renounce the world, and cultivate the Dao.' When I awoke, I wished to stop eating, but my mother forced me.\" She then dreamed of the deity’s anger, who said: \"I commanded you not to eat—you have violated my warning.\" He split open her abdomen, removed her intestines and stomach, washed them in a jade basin, then returned them to her belly and sealed it. He then transmitted to her the *Lingbao Great Cavern Scripture*, the *Great Cavern Method of the Great Master of Returning Wind and Blending Harmony*, and the talisman of the Perfected One, instructing her to heal the sick of the world. Upon hearing this, her mother awoke in shock and said: \"You are no ordinary person. I will break off your marriage so you may fulfill your destiny.\" From then on, she lived alone in a quiet chamber. When asked, she used talismanic water to cure illnesses, and people from near and far rushed to seek her talismans. If invited to visit a home to treat an illness, she would have two servants carry her in a sedan chair. She carried no provisions, and if her attendants grew hungry mid-journey, she would buy two peaches, breathe upon them, and give them to the person. After eating one peach, they would not hunger for dozens of miles.\n\nAn investigating censor named Chen, who lived in Qiantang, used the *Celestial Heart Method* to treat illnesses. Beside his residence, he built a multi-story tower in a separate garden. A gardener reported seeing someone riding a horse across it, but Chen shouted them away, saying: \"How could such a thing be?\" In early spring, he lodged a sword-bearing guard below the tower and also heard the sound of horses. Soon after, a servant knocked at his door, urging him to return home, saying: \"Your youngest daughter is striking at the air as if something were restraining her.\" He saw it was true—his daughter had fallen into a stupor and remained unconscious for days. Chen went to the tower to perform a ritual and exorcise the disturbance. Fire erupted from the walls, and in his haste to flee, the flames subsided. He then summoned a Daoist to subdue the entity, but as the Daoist approached the door, his headscarf vanished, and the household grew fearful. Chen wrote a letter inviting Yuanzhao, who arrived in full ceremonial attire. Chen’s daughter rose to greet her at the door, laughing and speaking as if she had never been ill. Yuanzhao took her to stay in the tower. For three days and nights, nothing unusual was seen, and the girl remained at ease.\n\nHan Zichen, a descendant of a grand commandant and an official in the capital, once wrote a memorial to be presented to Heaven, recounting his encounter with the Supreme Lord’s rise to power—no one else knew of this. He invited Yuanzhao to submit it. She prostrated herself for a long while, then rose and recited the memorial’s contents word for word, saying: \"The Emperor commends your tranquility and lack of ambition, replying: 'Guard your duty for twelve hundred days, and the Ministry of Justice will reward your merit.'\" Later, all came to pass as she had foretold. From childhood, Han had suffered from a foot ailment that, when it flared, left him unable to bend or stretch. Yuanzhao massaged him, and he felt a fiery heat in his waist. She also rubbed his abdomen, which grew warm, and with a gentle touch, qi flowed from his toes. Immediately, he stood on the ground, and his ailment vanished. One of Han’s servants lodged in a cramped hut beside the main house. One night, he dreamed of a ghostly figure pressing down on him. He cried out and fled, encountering Yuanzhao on the way. Without telling her what had happened, he walked with her to the hut. Yuanzhao turned back at the threshold, saying: \"Someone who hanged themselves is in there. Their hair hangs loose, their tongue protrudes—they saw me and begged for deliverance.\" She wrote a talisman and ordered the servant to burn it. That night, he dreamed of the ghost apologizing, saying: \"I have received the true official talisman and been reborn. I will not return.\" The next morning, the door opened of its own accord.\n\nThe Han family prepared a bed for Yuanzhao to rest, but no breath was heard. Gradually, a cloud of green qi arose from her nose, and a baby about three inches long, the color of blue glass, shone light across the bed, circling above her abdomen. After a moment, it disappeared.\n\nA maid in the household of Duke Zhang Xun was pregnant past her due date and could not give birth. Yuanzhao was summoned. As the maids stood around, she looked only at the pregnant woman and sighed, saying: \"In your past life, you were a woodcutter who struck and killed a great serpent. Now, it has come to repay you—it is in your belly, eating your five organs to the end.\" She urgently told the Duke to have it removed. She wrote two talismans and gave them to the maid, who burned them as instructed and drank the water. She then gave birth to a large serpent. When the Duke heard of this, he was greatly alarmed and treated Yuanzhao with reverence, offering her gold and silk, which she refused. Later, she stayed with the Han family for a year. When she wished to leave, they tried to stop her, but she would not be deterred.",

      "translated_text": "She sighed and took her leave, saying: \"I shall not come again.\" The crowd suspected she would soon ascend as an immortal. The next day, she boarded a boat and returned to Xiaoshan. Upon reaching home, she passed away without illness.\n\nPrior to this, over ten households in the town had each seen Yuanzhao dressed in Daoist robes, visiting their homes to converse. After some time, she would depart. Days later, some went to Yuanzhao’s home to inquire, only to be told by her family: \"She has died.\" Several townspeople who had encountered her in succession all said: \"She was just at my home yesterday—how could this be?\" Verifying the dates of their visits revealed they coincided with the day of her *shijie*. This occurred in the eleventh year of the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song.\n\n**Sun the Immortal Maiden**\nThe Immortal Maiden, surnamed Sun, was named Bu’er and styled the Serene One. She was the youngest daughter of Sun Zhonglan, a powerful clansman of Ninghai. In the second year of the Tianfu reign of Emperor Taizu of Jin, during the spring of the *wuxu* year, her mother dreamed of seven cranes dancing in the courtyard, their feathers shimmering. One crane gradually entered her embrace, and upon waking, she found herself pregnant. After three years, on the fifth day of the first month of the *jihai* year, the maiden was born. From birth, she was intelligent and gentle, her virtuous demeanor naturally refined.\n\nWhen the time came to arrange her marriage, her father, Zhonglan, heard that the alchemist Master Wumeng had praised Ma Yifu as possessing the qualities of a true immortal. Thus, he betrothed her to him. They had three sons, all of whom she instructed in proper conduct. Yifu, being immensely wealthy, often aided the poor, and the Immortal Maiden always supported him in these deeds.\n\nOne day, the Patriarch [Wang Chongyang] drew a scroll depicting hell and showed it to her, saying: \"If you can leave the household life, you will surely attain this reward.\" Yet she remained only partially convinced. That winter, the Patriarch vowed to seclude himself in the hermitage for a hundred days, eating only once every five days. Yifu personally delivered his meals and witnessed many divine transformations, which the Patriarch used to guide him ten times. He rescued souls from hell, warning ten times of the transgressions caused by the three karmic actions. Ten times he revealed the wondrous efficacy of the nine elixirs through the exchange of pears. He also bestowed upon them taro and chestnuts, imparting the precepts of the Dao.\n\nSeeing their attachment to wealth and possessions, which would ultimately lead to their ruin, the Patriarch feigned drunkenness one day and entered Yifu’s residence, lingering outside the Immortal Maiden’s bedchamber. She rebuked him for his impropriety and had the door locked, sending a servant to summon Yifu from the marketplace to inform him. Yifu said: \"The Master and I have been discussing the Dao without leaving our seats—how could this have happened?\" When they returned and unlocked the door, the room was empty. Peering into the locked hermitage, they saw the Patriarch soundly asleep. Only then did the Immortal Maiden begin to hold him in reverence and faith.\n\nAnother day, the Patriarch again painted a scroll of paradise and showed it to her, saying: \"If you truly leave the household life, you will surely receive this reward.\" A year later, in the summer of the *jichou* year, Zhou Botong of the prefecture donated his residence to establish the Golden Lotus Hall, inviting the Patriarch and [Ma] Danyang to reside there. On the fifth day of the fifth month, the Immortal Maiden abandoned her three sons, severed all worldly ties, and went to the hall seeking liberation.\n\nThat morning, the Patriarch sent Danyang away from the hall. When the Immortal Maiden arrived, he ordered her to burn her vow before the Dao and bestowed upon her the name *Bu’er* and the title *Serene One*. He also presented her with a poem:\n\n*\"The ten transformations of the pear trace your past karma,*\n*Heaven’s auspicious moment comes naturally.*\n*Why did you not depart sooner?*\n*It was only to await the golden lotus.\"*\n\nThe Patriarch then led her through the streets to beg for alms and instructed her to build a separate hermitage to reside in, where she would later transmit the essentials of the Dao. At that time, the Immortal Maiden was fifty-one years old.\n\nThat autumn, the Patriarch took Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma to Bianliang. The following year, the Patriarch ascended as an immortal. In the twelfth year, the *renchen* year, Danyang returned the Patriarch’s coffin to Liujiang in Zhongnan, where the Patriarch had originally established his hermitage. After the funeral rites were completed, Danyang observed mourning and guarded the tomb, living in a humble hut for sixteen years.\n\nIn the *bingshen* year, the Immortal Maiden also passed through Tong Pass, intending to delve deeper into the supreme principles of the *Cantong Qi* and resolve her lingering doubts. Danyang composed a *Langtaosha* to send to her, and she responded with a distant bow of gratitude. Both resided in separate hermitages, practicing the teachings they had received.\n\nLater, she moved east to Luoyang. There was another Immortal Maiden named Feng, commonly called Little Second Daughter. According to the preface written by the *jinshi* Wang Yu for her inscription: Feng the Immortal Maiden originally came from the Guanzhong region during the Huangtong reign and settled in the eastern capital. She did not reveal her surname, age, or place of origin. Judging by her accent, she seemed to be from Qin. She begged for food to sustain herself, her face unwashed and her hair unkempt, deliberately making herself appear filthy to distance herself from worldly demons. By day, she wandered madly through the bustling markets; by night, she took shelter in abandoned shrines.",

She wrote two talismans and gave them to the maid, who burned them as instructed and drank the water. She then gave birth to a large serpent. When the Duke heard of this, he was greatly alarmed and treated Yuanzhao with reverence, offering her gold and silk, which she refused. Later, she stayed with the Han family for a year. When she wished to leave, they tried to stop her, but she would not be deterred.",

      "translated_text": "She harbored no love or hatred, made no judgments of right or wrong. Abiding in effortless tranquility, she followed her nature and let things take their course. Thus she cultivated the Dao of immortality within while concealing her immortal traces without, yet could speak freely to expound profound truths. She once said:\n\n*\"Green leaves spread boundless across the sky,\nYellow blossoms bloom across the earth.\nA thousand leagues you seek in vain,\nTen thousand leagues you seize them forth.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n\n*\"When oil is spent and the lamp burns dry, the flame dies of itself—\nYet the one who trims the wick is seen again in the wind.\"*\n\nSuch words of hers were too numerous to record.\n\nWhen the Immortal Maiden arrived in Luoyang, she took up residence there. Feng the Immortal Maiden’s dwelling had two caves: she bade the Immortal Maiden to live in the lower cave while she herself occupied the upper. She would pile bricks and stones at the entrance, and whenever a man passed the lower cave, she would hurl them at him, so that external demons could not create obstacles. Through her guidance and encouragement, the Immortal Maiden attained the Way in six years. She then began to teach and transform others, and many turned toward her in devotion.\n\nShe once composed a *Busaizi* to instruct the assembly:\n\n*\"Grasp firm and don your robe,\nAwait the union of water and fire.\nFrom the ocean’s depths, ten thousand rays of rosy light arise—\nA single strike pierces the Three Passes.\nImmortal music plays again and again,\nAs I drink the wine of fermentation.\nNo wondrous elixir is needed—\nIn an instant, nine cycles of cinnabar are complete.\"*\n\nOn the last day of the twelfth lunar month in the twenty-second year of the *renyin* cycle, she suddenly addressed her disciples: \"My teacher in the realm of truth has summoned me to the Jasper Pool; the appointed hour is near.\" She then bathed, changed her clothes, and asked, \"What is the celestial hour now?\" They replied, \"It is the hour of *wu*.\" She ordered brush and paper be brought and wrote a verse to leave behind:\n\n*\"Three thousand merits fulfilled, I transcend the Three Realms,\nLeaping beyond the embrace of yin and yang.\nHidden or manifest, I roam freely—\nMy drunken soul shall never return to the Sea of Tranquility.\"*\n\nHaving written this, she sat cross-legged and passed away in an instant. A fragrant breeze scattered, and auspicious vapors lingered, refusing to disperse for an entire day.\n\nAt that time, Dan Yang was dwelling in a humble abode in Ninghai. Hearing immortal music resounding through the sky, he looked up and saw the Immortal Maiden riding upon a cloud of many colors. Jade maidens and immortal youths, bearing banners and insignia, escorted her before and behind. She leaned down and said to Dan Yang, \"I am returning to Penglai Isle first.\"\n\nIn the spring of the *xinchou* year of the Great Yuan, when the Prefect of Jingzhao, Lord Tian, was to inter the immortal remains of Master Chong Yang, Master Qing He, along with the masters of the ancestral court and the prefect’s officials, established the Qingzhen Abbey at the estate of Academician Li in Zhongnan County. They first opened the Immortal Maiden’s tomb and reinterred her remains in the Golden Lotus Hall of the abbey, establishing it as a sanctuary for Daoist women of all directions.\n\nIn the *jiachen* year, by imperial decree, the abbey was elevated to a palace. In the first month of the *jisi* year of the *Zhiyuan* era, she was posthumously enfeoffed as the Perfected One of Serene Depth, Chastity, and Virtuous Power.\n\n*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages, Scroll Six—End.*",
