  "full_translation": "**Profound Source of the Dao’s Mysteries: Continuation of the Cavern of True Reality**\n*Scripture Title:* *Profound Source of the Dao’s Mysteries: Continuation of the Cavern of True Reality*\nAnnotated by Li Jingyuan of the Song Dynasty\nThree scrolls\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Supreme Mystery Section\n\n**Profound Source of the Dao’s Mysteries: Continuation of the Cavern of True Reality, Scroll One**\nCompiled and annotated by Li Jingyuan, disciple of the Gate of True Origin\n\n**Question on the Meridians and Collaterals**\nMaster Liu states: How noble is the human body! The hand Shaoyang Triple Burner meridians and collaterals—with their patterns of disease, origins, progression, and treatment—are vast indeed.\n\nThe Dao’s operation through wondrous reality spans from antiquity to the present. Thus, one who speaks well of the past must find verification in the present; one who speaks well of Heaven must find confirmation in humanity. The celestial divisions of qi number twelve, to which the human meridians correspond; the degrees of the celestial circuit total three hundred and sixty-five, to which the human qi points correspond. The nine orifices, five viscera, and twelve joints of the human body—referring to the three yin and three yang of the hands and feet—all communicate with Heaven’s qi and respond to the seasons.\n\nWhen the Dipper’s handle turns, the *Tai* hexagram of the *yin* position marks the onset of the first lunar month, and the pitch standard aligns with *Taicou*. The ancient system took *zi* as the origin, but now *yin* is regarded as the beginning. Thus, the celestial Dao moves southward: its image above is the Human and Horse constellations, and below, the Swallow. Its qi concentrates in the human Triple Burner.\n\nThe Triple Burner is the official of the waterways, from which the water passages emerge. It pertains to the Bladder, the solitary *fu*. The Heart and Lungs reside together in the Upper Burner, which is like mist; the Liver and Spleen share the Middle Burner, which is like a marsh; and the Kidneys occupy the Lower Burner, which is like a drainage ditch. The Triple Burner is the thoroughfare of water and grain, the beginning and end of the spirit and qi.\n\nThe Upper Burner lies below the Heart and above the diaphragm, at the upper opening of the Stomach. It governs intake but not discharge, and its treatment point is one *cun* and six *fen* below the *Shanzhong* (Jade Hall), in the depression between the two nipples. The Middle Burner lies in the central region of the Stomach, neither above nor below, governing the decomposition of water and grain. Its treatment point is beside the navel, called *Tianshu*. The Lower Burner lies below the navel, at the upper opening of the Bladder, governing the separation of the clear and turbid, discharge but not intake, and the transmission of waste. Its treatment point is one *cun* below the navel, named *Sanjiao* (Triple Burner), and its *fu* is at *Qichong*. *Qichong* is located below the navel, at the two ends of the pubic bone, one *cun* above the groin, where the pulsation of the femoral artery responds to the hand.\n\nThe transformations of the Triple Burner’s six qi all emanate from the meridians. The well points (*jing*) are Metal: *Guanchong*, two points located at the tips of the little finger and the next finger, a leek-leaf’s width from the nail. The flowing points (*rong*) are Water: *Yemen*, two points in the depression between the little finger and the next finger. The transporting points (*shu*) are Wood: *Zhongzhu*, two points behind the proximal joint of the little finger and the next finger. The Triple Burner’s *shu* point is below the thirteenth vertebra, and its *mu* point is two *cun* below the navel, called the *Dantian*. The source points (*yuan*) are *Yangchi*, two points in the depression on the dorsal wrist. All meridians take their *shu* points as their source, located between the Kidneys below the navel. The moving qi is the life of the human being, the root of all meridians—hence it is called the *yuan* (source).\n\nThe channel points (*jing*) are Fire: *Zhigou*, two points three *cun* behind the wrist, between the two bones. At the *qian* hour of night, the human qi resides in the hand Shaoyang Triple Burner meridian; the vertical vessels are the *jing* (channels). By the *xu* hour, the human qi also lies in the Triple Burner’s collaterals; the horizontal vessels are the *luo* (collaterals). *Jia* governs the left hand’s Shaoyang, its qi in the Gallbladder, pertaining to the Middle Burner. *Yin*—the first month—governs the left foot’s Shaoyang, and the human qi on the left also resides in the Liver.\n\nThe uniting points (*he*) are Earth: *Tianjing*, two points in the depression one *cun* above the elbow, behind the outer bone. The Triple Burner is the hand Shaoyang meridian. It begins at the tip of the little finger and the next finger, ascends between the two fingers, follows the back of the hand, emerges between the two bones of the forearm, passes through the elbow, ascends along the outer arm to the shoulder, crosses behind the foot Shaoyang, enters the supraclavicular fossa, spreads through the *Shanzhong*, connects with the Pericardium, descends through the diaphragm, and pertains to the Triple Burner.\n\n**Triple Burner Disorders**\nWhen the Triple Burner is diseased, the abdomen becomes full, the lower abdomen particularly hard, urination is obstructed, and urgency leads to overflow, causing water retention.\n\nThe Upper Burner lies below the Heart and above the diaphragm, at the upper opening of the Stomach. It governs intake but not discharge, and its treatment point is one *cun* and six *fen* below *Shanzhong* (Jade Hall), in the depression between the two nipples. The Middle Burner lies in the central region of the Stomach, neither above nor below, governing the decomposition of water and grain. Its treatment point is one *cun* below the navel, named *Sanjiao*. The Lower Burner lies below the navel, at the upper opening of the Bladder, governing the separation of the clear and turbid, discharge but not intake, and the transmission of waste. Its treatment point is one *cun* below the navel, named *Sanjiao*. Its *fu* is at *Qichong*, near the *Dantian*. The Upper Burner’s *mu* point is two *cun* below the navel.\n\n**Discourse on Upper Burner Deficiency-Cold**\nThe Upper Burner is like mist. Its qi arises at the upper opening of the Stomach, ascends alongside the throat, and penetrates the diaphragm. When its qi is deficient and cold, it causes the spirit to lose its residence. Drawing qi into the Lungs, it results in coughing, loss of voice, and the onset of diaphragmatic cold disorders.\n\n**Discourse on Upper Burner Heat**\nThe Upper Burner lies below the Heart. Its qi arises at the upper opening of the Stomach, ascends alongside the throat, and penetrates the diaphragm. When heat is present, it causes dryness of the throat and tongue, foul breath, flushed face, and the onset of chest and diaphragmatic fullness and stagnation.\n\n**Discourse on Middle Burner Deficiency-Cold**\nThe Middle Burner is like a marsh, for it lies in the central region of the Stomach, neither above nor below, governing the decomposition of water and grain. The Stomach’s yang qi must be warm to decompose and transform the essence of water and grain, nourishing the entire body. If cold invades this central position, the Stomach becomes cold. When the Stomach is cold, food is not digested, leading to abdominal pain, undigested diarrhea, cholera, vomiting, and diarrhea. The treatment method should involve warming and supplementation.\n\n**Discourse on Middle Burner Heat**\n\nThe Middle Burner resides in the central region of the Stomach, neither above nor below, governing the decomposition and maturation of water and grain. Its qi is harmonious and gentle, smoothly transmitting the waste and steaming the fluids to transform them. The refined essence ascends to infuse the Lungs, circulating through the constructive and defensive qi. If heat lodges in the Middle Burner, it congeals into hardness, causing its qi to become replete and obstructed, failing to communicate between above and below. The diaphragm becomes severed by heat, the exterior of the body grows heavy, the eyes turn yellow, and a sweet taste lingers in the mouth—thus arise the signs of spleen obstruction.\n\n**Discourse on Lower Burner Deficiency-Cold**\n\nThe Lower Burner is like a drainage ditch. Its qi arises from the lower region of the Stomach, diverging at the turning intestine and pouring into the Bladder. It governs outward movement without inward retention, serving as the pathway of transmission. If its qi is deficient and cold, the fluids are not secured, leading to incessant diarrhea of both stool and urine, lower abdominal pain, and aversion to hearing human speech. Should all Three Burners be deficient: Upper Burner deficiency draws qi into the Lungs; Middle Burner deficiency generates cold, giving rise to abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, incessant bowel movements, and cholera; Lower Burner deficiency results in unceasing stool and urine, the severance of fluids and qi, and cold—thus supplementation should target the Kidneys. Now, the Three Burners are the pathways of water and grain, the beginning and end of qi. Though their locations differ, their principle is one, hence the existence of diseases where all are deficient. The treatment should involve warming.\n\n**Discourse on Lower Burner Heat**\n\nThe Lower Burner lies below the navel, at the upper opening of the Bladder, governing the separation of the clear and turbid. It moves outward without inward retention, serving as the pathway of transmission. Moreover, the Lower Burner is like a drainage ditch, managing the dredging and discharge of qi. If it is replete and harbors heat, the fluids within desiccate, and transmission becomes impeded—thus arise signs of qi counterflow, difficult defecation, abdominal distension, and retching. The treatment method should involve draining and guiding the qi of the Three Burners.\n\n**Comprehensive Discourse on the Three Burners**\n\nThe Three Burners have a name but no form, presiding over all qi to emulate the functions of the Three Powers. Thus, the ascent and descent of breath, the coming and going of water and grain, all depend on this for free passage. Therefore, the Upper Burner lies below the Heart, governing inward retention without outward discharge; the Middle Burner lies in the Stomach region, governing the decomposition and maturation of water and grain; the Lower Burner lies below the navel, governing the separation of the clear and turbid, moving outward without inward retention. In comprehensive discussion, the Three Burners correspond above to the Lesser Yang, emerging at Guanchong. Guanchong is located at the tip of the ring finger on the hand, belonging to the Hand Lesser Yang channel, a network vessel of the Greater Yang. When the qi of the Three Burners is exuberant and in excess, distension and fullness fill the space within the skin, feeling light yet unsubstantial. Alternatively, the urine may be clear while defecation is difficult. Difficult defecation arises from disharmony among the Five Viscera, where yin and yang are unevenly deficient or replete—this is called disharmony of the Three Burners, where cold and heat congeal together. This is the repletion of the Three Burners, and the appropriate method is to guide and drain their qi. If the qi of the Three Burners is insufficient, cold qi invades, causing enuresis, diarrhea, qi fullness, or undigested food—this is the deficiency of the Three Burners’ qi. The appropriate method is to warm Laogong and Guanyuan, embracing unity and securing the Origin, while closing the mouth, curling the tongue, and swallowing the fetal fluids. Laogong, a Fire point, lies below the pulsation in the center of the palm; it is located by bending the ring finger to find it. Guanyuan, the alarm point of the Small Intestine, lies three body-inches below the navel, at the convergence of the Foot Three Yin and the Conception Vessel.\n\nHeaven possesses great beauty yet does not speak; the four seasons have bright laws yet do not debate; the myriad things have completed principles yet do not explain. Thus, Heaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed and the hundred things are born. Only the sage traces the beauty of Heaven and Earth, penetrating the principles of the myriad things. In regulation, spring is warm, summer is hot, autumn is sharp, winter is stern—the four seasons alternate in succession without uniformity. When yang is in operation, the myriad things flourish; at such times, people seek and follow. When yin is in operation, the myriad things congeal; at such times, people become tranquil and sigh. Moreover, the six transformations govern the five flavors, the generation of the five colors, and the suitability for the Five Viscera—all are tied to the waxing and waning of growth and decline.\n\nIn each year, the months of *yin*, *mao*, and *chen* constitute springtime. Spring qi moves westward, residing in the channels and vessels—thus, in spring, the pulse is taut like a hook, which is the norm. If it does not follow the norm but deviates, it is pathological. Spring qi begins below and to the left. It is also said that spring qi begins in the front; thus, in the first and second months, spring qi resides in the Liver. The Liver governs in spring and flourishes in *jia* and *yi*, with its transport point in the neck and nape. The Liver is the organ of the general, whence plans and deliberations emerge; it is the abode of the ethereal soul. The Liver is the master of generation, the Lesser Yang, the beginning of yang’s growth. In the first, second, and third months, human qi resides on the left. To nourish yang in spring, one should consume cooling foods to cultivate yang. The Liver detests wind and also fears clarity—clarity is the command of Metal. If spring is injured by wind, summer will bring watery diarrhea. Thus, spring diseases reside in the Liver, the head, and the transport points, as well as in its yin aspect. Moreover, spring diseases begin in the front. Those skilled in nurturing life regulate their spirit in accordance with spring qi: retiring late and rising early, strolling broadly in the courtyard, loosening the hair and relaxing the body to enliven the will—this is the Way of nurturing life in response to spring qi. Spring should be cool to govern the Liver, but if it is warm instead, one should distance oneself from warmth, for following this preserves the spirit, while opposing it injures the Liver.\n\nIn the month when the Dipper’s handle points due east, the second month of spring, *mao* is in the phase of *Great Strength*. The pitch standard is *Zhonglü*, the celestial path moves southwest, its image above is the Celestial Scorpion Palace, below is Song. Its qi resides in the human Large Intestine. The Large Intestine is the organ of transmission, whence transformations emerge. The method of transformation: the Metal well point of the Hand Yangming Large Intestine channel is Shangyang, two points located on the inner side of the index finger, a leek-leaf’s width from the corner of the nail; the Wood spring point is Erjian, two points in the depression on the inner side of the index finger’s proximal joint; the Wood transport point is Sanjian, two points in the depression on the inner side of the index finger’s distal joint; the Large Intestine transport point is below the sixteenth vertebra, on either side; the source point is Hegu, two points in the depression between the thumb and index finger, also called the Tiger’s Mouth.\n\nThe Fire channel point is Yangxi, two points located in the depression between the two tendons on the upper side of the wrist. At the hour of *jia* (5–7 a.m.) each day, the human qi resides here. The Hand Yangming Large Intestine channel, by the hour of *mao* (5–7 a.m.), also has the human qi in the Large Intestine network. *Geng* governs the right hand’s Lesser Yin, and its qi governs illnesses of the Large Intestine. *Mao* serves as the weft; the second month governs the left foot’s Greater Yang, and by this time, the human qi on the left also resides in the liver.\n\nThe Earth convergence point is Quchi, two points located in the depression at the posterior border of the elbow’s auxiliary bone when the elbow is flexed. The Large Intestine is not unlike the lung in this regard. The Large Intestine Hand Yangming channel begins at the tip of the index finger, ascends along the finger’s edge, emerges between the two bones at Hegu, enters the space between the two tendons, follows the upper border of the forearm, enters the outer side of the elbow, ascends along the outer border of the upper arm, emerges at the anterior border of the shoulder, passes above the meeting point of the clavicle, descends into the supraclavicular fossa to connect with the lung, passes through the diaphragm, and pertains to the Large Intestine.\n\nIn Large Intestine disease, there is acute pain in the intestines with gurgling sounds. When cold is contracted again in winter, diarrhea occurs with pain below the navel, and one cannot stand for long—this is the same as stomach symptoms. The *Classic* states: \"After eating to satiety, the sinews and channels become slack, and intestinal displacement leads to hemorrhoids. This is because excessive eating injures the intestines and stomach.\" The symptoms of Large Intestine disease: the Large Intestine corresponds to Metal and governs autumn; the Hand Yangming is its channel. It is the organ of the lung and serves as the official of transmission, whence the transformation of waste emerges.\n\nWhen its qi is exuberant, it becomes excessive, causing acute pain within the intestines as if pierced by an awl or knife without respite, accompanied by cold impediment and spasms in the lower back and spine at rest—this is the repletion of Large Intestine qi, and purging is appropriate. When Large Intestine qi is insufficient, cold qi invades, leading to frequent diarrhea—this is the vacuity of Large Intestine qi, and supplementation is appropriate.\n\nWhen examining the pulse at the *cunkou* of the right hand, it pertains to the Hand Yangming channel. A floating pulse indicates Yang; if the Yang is replete, the Large Intestine is replete. The diseases of Large Intestine vacuity and cold include panting in the chest, intestinal rumbling, vacuous thirst, dry lips, tense eyes, susceptibility to fright, sloppy diarrhea, pain in the joints, and inability to stand for long. When cold evil lodges within, the qi becomes vacuous and weak, unable to secure itself, giving rise to various illnesses. When examining the pulse, if the Yang is vacuous before the *qikou* of the right hand, this is the condition.\n\nIn Large Intestine repletion, the Large Intestine is the organ of transmission and drainage. When its qi is exuberant and replete, dryness and heat arise. If transmission and drainage are impeded, there is pain in the intestines as if pierced by an awl or knife, or mouse-like growths form, with swelling, distension, pain, and oppression. When the Large Intestine is obstructed, there is abdominal and rib-side distension and fullness, heaviness and pain in the lower back and spine, and panting with fullness above—all signs of Large Intestine qi repletion. The disease primarily involves heat consuming fluids, causing constipation. If there is only blockage without defecation, these are the symptoms.\n\nThus, the Perfected One’s dietary regimen includes walking a hundred paces after eating and repeatedly massaging the abdomen to prevent the onset of severe illnesses. For those in old age, around eighty, with constipation due to scant fluids, cold medicinals should not be used to induce purgation, as recorded in the *Materia Medica*. Use one *jin* of tangerine peel and six *liang* of apricot kernels, forming honey pills called \"Qi-Descending Pills.\" These not only descend qi but also moisten the Large Intestine, enabling eating without damaging qi. When entering the Large Intestine, their supplementation and purgation are regulated, and their treatment aligns with that of the lung viscus.\n\nThe Celestial Stem *tian gang* follows the establishment of the third month of spring. The *gua* of *chen* is *guai*, and its pitch corresponds to *Guxi*. The celestial Dao moves northward; its image above is the celestial palace *gong*, and below is *Zheng*. Its qi resides in the human Small Intestine. The Small Intestine is the official of reception and transformation, whence the transformation of substances emerges.\n\nThe method of transformation: the Metal well point of the Hand Taiyang Small Intestine channel is Shaoze, two points located at the tip of the little finger, one *fen* from the lower edge of the nail. The Wood spring point is Qiangu, two points in the depression anterior to the little finger’s proximal joint on the outer side. The Wood transport point is Houxi, two points in the depression posterior to the little finger’s proximal joint on the outer side. The Small Intestine transport point is below the eighteenth vertebra on either side. Guanyuan is one point located three *cun* below the navel, the gathering point of the Small Intestine, where the Foot Taiyin, Shaoyin, Jueyin, and Ren channels meet—the lower regulator is Guanyuan. The source point is at Wangu, two points in the depression below the prominent bone on the anterior side of the wrist’s outer edge.\n\nThe Fire channel point is Yanggu, two points in the depression below the prominent bone on the outer side of the wrist. At the hour of *ding* (9–11 a.m.) each day, the human qi resides here. The Hand Taiyang Small Intestine channel, by the hour of *wei* (1–3 p.m.), also has the human qi in the Small Intestine network. *Bing* governs the left hand’s Yangming, and its qi governs illnesses of the Small Intestine. *Chen* is the third month, governing the left foot’s Yangming, and by this time, the human qi on the left also resides in the spleen.\n\nThe Earth convergence point is Shaohai, two points in the depression posterior to the inner side of the elbow’s auxiliary bone. Thus, the Small Intestine and heart are exterior-interior pairs. The Small Intestine Hand Taiyang channel begins at the tip of the little finger, ascends along the outer side of the hand to the wrist, emerges at the styloid process, ascends straight along the ulna, exits the inner side of the elbow between the two tendons, follows the outer posterior border of the upper arm, emerges at the shoulder joint, encircles the scapula, intersects above the shoulder, enters the supraclavicular fossa to connect with the heart, descends along the throat, passes through the diaphragm to reach the stomach, and pertains to the Small Intestine.\n\nIn Small Intestine disease, there is pain in the Small Intestine, with the lower back and spine feeling as if pulled by a bowstring, and pain extending to the anus. There is scorching heat in front of the ears, and severe cold aversion. If only the shoulder is extremely hot, or the area between the little finger and ring finger is hot, or the pulse is sunken, these are the symptoms. *Ze* is pronounced as *gaoyin*; the symptoms of Small Intestine disease: the Small Intestine corresponds to Fire and governs summer; the Hand Taiyang is its channel. It is the organ of the heart. The downward movement of water and fluids becomes urine, which flows into the Small Intestine.\n\nWhen its qi is exuberant, it becomes excessive, causing Small Intestine disease with heat, scorching, dryness, and roughness. If the Small Intestine is distended, this is the repletion of Small Intestine qi.\n\nThen it is appropriate to purge it. When the Small Intestine is deficient, cold qi invades it. In cases of Small Intestine disease, there may be fright, jumping, and inability to speak, with symptoms appearing and disappearing suddenly—these are signs of Small Intestine qi deficiency. In such cases, it is appropriate to tonify.\n\nThe *Treatise on Small Intestine Deficiency* states: The Small Intestine is the official of reception and transformation, the palace of the heart. The Hand Taiyang is its channel. When its qi is deficient, it becomes insufficient. Thus, if the pulse at the *cunkou* of the left hand, before the *renying*, is yang-deficient, this indicates Small Intestine deficiency. Deficiency generates cold, giving rise to symptoms such as unilateral pain at the forehead and temples, deafness, fright, and frequent urination. The treatment should focus on tonification.\n\nThe *Treatise on Small Intestine Repletion* states: The Small Intestine is the official of reception and transformation, the palace of the heart. The Hand Taiyang is its channel. When its qi is exuberant, it becomes excessive. Thus, if the pulse at the *cunkou* of the left hand, before the *renying*, is yang-replete, this indicates Small Intestine repletion. Repletion generates heat, giving rise to symptoms such as alternating fever, mouth sores, heart vexation, heavy body with no sweating, and inhibited urination. Treatment should employ the methods of supplementation and drainage, aligning with the heart’s organ without deviation.\n\nNext in sequence is the establishment of the early summer month, corresponding to the *si* (巳) hexagram of *Qian* (乾), with the pitch tuned to *Zhonglü*. The *Qian* Dao moves westward; its celestial symbol is the Double Maiden Palace, and its terrestrial counterpart is Chu. Its qi in humans pertains to the Hand Jueyin Pericardium channel. The well (metal) point is *Zhongchong*, located at the tip of the middle finger, one leaf of a leek’s width from the nail. The spring (wood) point is *Laogong*, situated at the center of the palm, found by flexing the ring finger. The stream (wood) point is *Daling*, located in the depression between the two tendons on the back of the wrist. The river (fire) point is *Jianshi*, found in the depression between the two tendons three *cun* proximal to the wrist.\n\nAt the *xin* hour, human qi resides in the Hand Jueyin Pericardium channel. By the *xu* hour, human qi also dwells in the Pericardium network. The *si* (巳) month governs the right foot’s Yangming channel, and when human qi is on the right, it also pertains to the spleen. The uniting (earth) point is *Quze*, located in the depression below the inner elbow crease, found by flexing the elbow. Alternatively, *Danzhong* is the official of the minister, from which joy and happiness arise. *Danzhong* lies between the two breasts in the chest, serving as the sea of qi. The Pericardium, as the ruler’s envoy, disseminates commands through the vessels. *Shanzhong* governs qi, distributing it between yin and yang. When qi harmonizes and the will is at ease, joy and happiness arise. Its transport point above is located above and below the *zhugu* (vertebra prominens), anterior to the *renying*. *Danzhong* is also described as the palace city of the Pericardium. Another reference places *Danzhong* as a single point in the depression between the two breasts, accessed while lying supine—this is where the Ren Mai’s qi emanates. The ancient immortals said: \"To ensure bodily peace, simmer the broth in the central hall.\"\n\nFollowing the sequence, the *si*, *wu*, and *wei* months still belong to summer. In summer, celestial qi moves northward, giving rise to rainbows, clouds, mist, wind, and rain across the four seasons—these are the accumulations of qi forming in heaven. Mountains, rivers, seas, metals, stones, fire, and wood are the accumulations of form taking shape on earth. Earth bears the forms of all living things, while the void arranges the essence-qi of heaven. The movement of form and essence is like the relationship between roots and branches. The ignorant merely see accumulated qi shining above, accumulated forms positioned below, and the yearly movements residing in between, yet fail to grasp the principle of the three as one.\n\nThe qi of the Five Phases correspond above to the five stars and internally penetrate the five viscera. It is said of the *Palace of Medicinals* and the *Flowery Terrace of Cloud Scripts*, as well as the profound discourses of the *Cavern Manuscripts*: The virtue of water corresponds to the Chen star, the virtue of wood to Jupiter, the virtue of fire to Mars, the virtue of earth to Saturn, and the virtue of metal to Venus. In humans, these correspond to the kidneys, liver, heart, spleen, and lungs.\n\nThus, summer qi begins in the center and extends forward, or is also said to begin from behind. Summer qi resides in the *sunluo* (grandchild network vessels). The main channels are likened to the trunk and branches, while the transverse vessels are the networks; the networks beyond these are the *sunluo*. The summer pulse is surging and large—this is its normal state. If it deviates from this norm, it indicates disease.\n\nFrom the fourth month of summer onward, human qi is on the right and pertains to the spleen. In the fifth and sixth months, qi similarly resides on the right and pertains to the head. From mid-summer, illnesses often manifest in the chest and flanks. The sixth month is known as *long summer*, with qi residing in the muscles and flesh. In *long summer*, illnesses often present as cold diarrhea. In mid-summer, diseases affect the yang and the heart and viscera.\n\nSummer takes the stomach qi as its foundation, and *long summer* also takes the stomach qi as its foundation. The transport points lie in the chest and flanks. In summer, the heart governs the qi of the human body. During the heat of summer, the heart is treated with coolness, yet paradoxically, heat arises. Generally, in summer, one should nourish yang by consuming cooling foods. However, while spring and summer diets favor cold and cool foods, the guiding principle of moderation—neither too warm nor too cold—remains the safest approach. This is the optimal way.\n\nSummer’s heat resides in the heart. Heat injures the form, so the heart dislikes heat and fears cold. Cold is the mandate of water, and thus using heat at the right time can keep heat at bay. Medicinals and food should follow the same principle. Therefore, the wise avoid compounding heat with heat. If one does not keep heat at a distance, heat will arrive. When heat arrives, it causes fever, vomiting, diarrhea, cholera, abscesses, sores, mental confusion, depression, diarrhea with urgency, spasms, swelling, distension, vomiting, nosebleeds, headaches, bone and joint pain, muscle soreness, blood overflow, blood in the stool, and urinary strangury.\n\nIt is said that when the heart spirit is in excess, yet the pulse and qi are also excessive while the form and qi are insufficient, the person may still live. Generally, when a person externally exhibits five signs of excess: (1) the body is hot as charcoal, (2) the neck and chest feel obstructed, (3) the *renying* pulse is agitated and exuberant, (4) there is panting, and (5) qi counterflow—if the body shows neither external nor internal signs, death is certain.\n\nWhen a person is injured by summerheat in summer, it transforms into malarial fever in autumn. Only the sage is not thus afflicted, for they can transmit their spirit, harmonize with celestial qi, and communicate with the divine luminaries.\n\nThus, tranquility is attained. If one suffers from illness, there exists the Dao of regulating the spirit in accordance with summer qi. This entails retiring late and rising early, never tiring of the sun, ensuring the mind remains free from anger, and allowing qi to flow freely. Such is the Dao of nurturing growth in response to summer qi. To contravene this injures the heart.\n\nWhen the Dipper’s handle points due south in the mid-summer month, it aligns with the *Gou* hexagram of the noon position, and the pitch corresponds to *Ruibin*. Noon marks the meridian, where the *Initial Six* yin begins to stir. The celestial Dao moves northwest, its image above in the constellation of the Lion, below in the Zhou region. Human qi resides in the heart, which governs the five viscera.\n\nThe heart is the zang-organ, the small intestine its paired fu-organ. Its nature is summerheat, which harms the form. Its note is *zhi*, its image *Li*. Fire reigns in summer, is cut off in winter, and perishes under the *ren* and *gui* stems. Thus, the human heart-mind responds to the eight winds:\n\nWhen wind comes from the east, it is called *Infant Wind*. It injures the outer sinews and twists, lodging internally in the liver.\nWhen wind comes from the southeast, it is called *Weak Wind*. It injures the outer flesh, lodging internally in the stomach.\nWhen wind comes from the south, it is called *Great Weak Wind*. It injures the outer vessels, lodging internally in the heart.\nWhen wind comes from the southwest, it is called *Plotting Wind*. It injures the outer muscles, lodging internally in the spleen.\nWhen wind comes from the west, it is called *Sturdy Wind*. It injures the outer skin, lodging internally in the lungs.\nWhen wind comes from the northwest, it is called *Breaking Wind*. It injures the *Taiyang* vessels of the hand, connecting internally to the small intestine.\nWhen wind comes from the north, it is called *Great Sturdy Wind*. It injures the outer bones, lodging internally in the kidneys.\nWhen wind comes from the northeast, it is called *Ominous Wind*. It injures the outer flanks and ribs, lodging internally in the large intestine.\n\nThus, the human heart-mind responds to the eight winds. For the qi of life communicates with Heaven—no small matter indeed.\n\nThe heart stores the spirit, which delights in serenity and emptiness. The heart is the sovereign official, the yang father. The external aspect of the heart is yang. As the root of life and the transformation of spirit, the heart is where the numinous luminosity emerges. Its luster manifests in the complexion, its fullness in the blood vessels. The vessels are the mansion of blood, where all blood converges under the heart’s governance.\n\nProlonged gazing injures the blood, for it wearies the heart. When the heart is wearied, one becomes absent-minded, forgetful, and suffers from difficult bowel movements—sometimes loose like duck droppings—or mouth sores. Grief, sorrow, and excessive contemplation injure the heart, leading to fright, forgetfulness, and erratic joy or anger.\n\nThe heart is yang qi, the supreme yang within yang. Yang diseases arise in the blood. The heart nourishes blood, and thus the vessels are the foundation of the five viscera. The heart governs the vessels, which course through the arms and hands. The heart opens into the ears, the anterior and posterior yin orifices. When essence and qi converge in the heart, joy arises. Thus, sudden joy injures the yang, the heart, and qi.\n\nThe heart’s fluid is sweat. The heart qi governs the tongue, its condition reflected there. Only when heart qi is harmonious does it communicate with the tongue. When the heart is at peace, the tongue discerns the five flavors. Its odor is scorched. A supple tongue indicates vitality; roughness, stiffness, or contraction foretell death.\n\nThe heart desires bitter flavors, which enter it first. Excessive bitter flavors cause the skin to wither and the hair to fall out. The heart desires softness; to soften it, consume salty foods promptly. The heart suffers from slackness; to restrain it, consume sour foods promptly. The heart loathes heat and fears cold, for cold is the mandate of water.\n\nExcessive bitter flavors fail to moisten the spleen qi, thickening the stomach qi—this is a forbidden flavor. Salt travels to the blood; in blood diseases, avoid excessive salt. The heart’s prohibitions are warm clothing and hot food.\n\nThus, the sage approaches sounds, colors, and flavors: what benefits nature is embraced, what harms it is discarded. When food and drink enter the stomach, they nourish the heart zang. When the heart flourishes, the complexion mirrors the sun. Thus, in heart heat, the forehead reddens first.\n\nIt is said that heart heat manifests as redness with overflowing vessels. If the complexion is predominantly green, there is pain; if black, numbness; if yellow-red, heat; if white, cold. When all five colors appear, there is both cold and heat. Though red and yellow signify heat, green, white, and black portend misfortune—how can one remain ignorant?\n\nThe southern direction is ruled by red qi, which fills the body with resonant sound, like wind and thunder. In humans, the heart stores sound, manifesting as laughter and mirth. Such is the heart at peace. If the heart is not at peace, the voice alters, and illness arises as hiccups, belching, or sorrow.\n\nAs the sovereign, the father, and the master of the five qi, the heart governs qi, vessels, sound, and color. The heart zang transforms in myriad ways: generation is called *transformation*; extremity, *change*.\n\nThe *Hand Shaoyin* is the heart’s meridian. Its *Jing-Well* point is *Shaochong*, two points located on the inner corner of the little finger, a leek-leaf’s width from the nail. Its *Ying-Spring* point is *Shaofu*, two points in the depression behind the little finger’s proximal joint. Its *Shu-Stream* point is *Shenmen*, two points at the ulnar end of the wrist crease; if the pulse here is imperceptible, death is untreatable.\n\nThe heart’s *Back-Shu* point lies below the fifth vertebra, bilateral to the spine, one and a half body-inches apart—the meeting of *Taiyang*. The heart’s *Yuan-Source* point emerges at *Daling*, flowing into the pericardium meridian. Its *Jing-River* point is *Lingdao*, two points one and a half inches (or one inch) proximal to the wrist crease.\n\nAt the *bing* hour of midday, human qi resides in the *Hand Shaoyin*, the heart’s meridian. At the *wu* hour, qi also dwells in the heart’s network vessels.\n\nThe *ding* stem governs the *Yangming* of the right hand, and its qi also governs the heart’s visceral diseases. The *wu* branch is the meridian; in the fifth month, it governs the *Taiyang* of the right foot, while human qi also resides on the right, dwelling in the head. The *Water* confluence is *Shaohai*, two points in the depression behind the inner elbow joint.\n\nThe *Hand Shaoyin*, the heart’s meridian, arises within the heart and emerges to connect with the heart’s system. It descends through the diaphragm to network with the small intestine. The heart’s balanced pulse is normally surging and large; if sunken, it is a predatory pulse, and reversal disorders arise.\n\nWhen summer heat invades the heart, the heart stores the qi of blood and vessels. If pathogenic qi lodges in the heart, illness follows: heart pain, melancholy, frequent dizziness, and fainting. Its diseases affect the vessels’ qi and the five viscera.\n\nThus, when the heart is diseased: pain in the chest, fullness in the flanks, pain beneath the flanks, pain in the breast, back, shoulders, and scapulae, and pain along the inner arms—these are the signs of heart disease. The heart corresponds to Fire. It flourishes in summer; its pulse is hooking and surging, its diagnostic sign is the tongue, its sound is speech, its odor is scorched, its flavor is bitter, its fluid is sweat, it nourishes blood, its color is red, and it stores the spirit. The *Hand Shaoyin* is its meridian. It pairs with the small intestine, which is the *Fu* governing the exterior, while the heart is the *Zang* governing the interior.\n\nWhen heart qi is abundant, it becomes spirit; if excessive, it causes illness. Pain within the chest, fullness in the flanks, pain beneath the flanks, pain in the breast, back, shoulders, scapulae, and between the arms, and incessant laughter—these are signs of heart qi excess. Excess generates heat; heat causes yang qi to flourish, and when yang qi flourishes, the qi of *ying* and *wei* cannot circulate. The heart spirit becomes restless, the face flushes, the body grows hot, sores appear in the mouth and on the tongue, the throat dries, the head aches. If heat is severe, the sinews wither, bones dissolve, flesh melts, the skin cracks, and hair stands on end and decays.\n\nSome say: when yang qi is excessive and yin qi insufficient, there is heat in the center. One is prone to hunger. When heart qi is insufficient, the chest expands, the flanks and lower back pull taut with pain, there is fright, palpitations, absentmindedness, pallor, stiffness at the root of the tongue, and frequent sorrow—these are signs of heart qi deficiency.\n\nA general discussion of the heart: The heart pairs with the small intestine, so the *Hand Shaoyin* meridian and the *Hand Taiyang* meridian form an exterior-interior relationship. It corresponds to Fire, flourishes in summer, its pulse is surging, it governs the spirit among the viscera, joy among the emotions, sorrow in its pathological movements, and sweat among the fluids. Thus, when heart qi is deficient, sorrow is unceasing; when excessive, laughter is unending. When heart qi is deficient, one dreams of rescuing from fire; when yang things prevail, one dreams of burning. When heart qi is abundant, one dreams of joy, laughter, fear, and reversal. When qi invades the heart, one dreams of mountains and flames. When the heart declines, one becomes forgetful. When the heart is hot, one sweats excessively.\n\nIn heart heat disease, one first feels dispirited for several days before heat arises. When heat contends, there is sudden heart pain, vexation, oppression, frequent retching, redness of the face, and absence of sweat. When qi rebels, there is reversal—a sudden decline or severance of yin and yang qi, disrupting their normal order. If yin qi declines and severs below, it becomes heat reversal. If yang qi declines and severs below, it becomes cold reversal.\n\nDeficiency generates cold: one feels dispirited, sorrowful, or endlessly grieving, experiences sudden pain in the heart and abdomen, spits clear saliva, is forgetful, and easily startled. If cold is severe, the sinews contract, the bones ache, and there is congealing and weeping. Some say: when heart spirit is insufficient and vessel qi deficient, yet form and qi are excessive, death follows. Or when yang qi is insufficient and yin qi excessive, there is cold in the center, borborygmi, and abdominal pain. If both yin and yang are excessive or both insufficient, there is both cold and heat.\n\nThus, all pain, itching, and sores belong to the heart. All heat, clouded vision, and convulsions belong to Fire. All lockjaw, chattering teeth, and loss of spirit as if bereft belong to Fire. All counterflow rushing upward belongs to Fire. All restlessness, mania, and transgression belong to Fire. All swelling, pain, soreness, fright, and alarm belong to Fire. All distension and abdominal enlargement belong to heat. All diseases with sounds like drumming belong to heat. All twisting, contortion, and turbid fluids belong to heat. All vomiting, sourness, sudden diarrhea, and urgent descent belong to heat. Thus, when heat prevails, swelling and binding occur. Yang causes swelling in the four limbs, for the four limbs are the root of all yang.\n\nIn all people, warmth and heat are treated by sweating. If sores are treated with heat, wind arises. Thus, heart wind causes redness of the mouth and peeling skin. When *bing* and *ding* days in summer are injured by wind, it is heart wind. The signs of heart wind: excessive sweating, aversion to wind, scorched dryness, frequent anger, and a red complexion. In severe cases, speech becomes incoherent. The diagnosis lies in the mouth, and its color is red. Only those who follow the Dao remain unheated. If the heart is occasionally deficient, sour flavors in medicines and foods should be used to supplement it. If excessive, sweet flavors should be used to drain it. Specialized methods for regulating qi should employ exhalation to treat it, but once the disease is cured, one must not overdo it.\n\nMoreover, in the late summer month, the *Dun* hexagram of *Wei* governs, and the pitch corresponds to *Linzhong*. Human qi responds to sound, and human yin and yang qi harmonize with the pitch. The celestial Dao moves eastward; its image above is the constellation Cancer, and below it is Qin. Its qi resides in the human lung.\n\nThe lung is the *Zang*, the large intestine the *Fu*. It corresponds to Metal, its nature is cool and clear, its note is *shang*. It flourishes in autumn, is severed in summer, dies on *bing* and *ding* days, and is nourished in the skin and hair. The lung values emptiness and tranquility, governs the source of harmonious qi, and is the chief of all viscera. It is the canopy of the heart and the yin mother of the body. It is also the *Shaoyin* within yin, the first of the yin viscera, and the ministerial official from which governance and regulation emerge. Thus, the lung is the root of qi and the dwelling of the *po*. It alone circulates *ying* and *wei*; *ying* circulates within the vessels as blood.\n\nThe *wei* circulates outside the vessels, as it is the external qi. Its flourishing appears in the hair, and its fullness resides in the skin. This means the human vessels and skin correspond to the heavens as the \"skin,\" covering the hundred bones and nurturing the five *Zang*. Since qi and skin/hair are thus connected, they are easily injured by wind evil. When wind evil harms the *Fu* and *Zang*, blood and qi become deficient and weak. Moreover, after excessive labor and profuse sweating, or following severe purgation that depletes the body fluids, the fluids become exhausted and cut off, causing lung qi to congest and fail to disseminate and regulate the qi of all *Zang*, thereby giving rise to lung atrophy. Its symptoms include coughing with spittle and vomiting, counterflow of drool and foam, and frequent urination. Yet prolonged lying down injures the qi, straining the lung. When the lung is strained, one becomes short of breath and the face swells, unable to smell fragrance or stench.\n\nIt is also said that exposure to cold, or cold food and drink, injures the lung—thus, cold exposure and cold drinks harm the lung. When the lung is injured, one becomes short of breath, coughs, and the nose whistles. The lung opens at the nose, and its fluid is nasal mucus. The mouth and nose are the gateways of qi. When harmonious qi flows freely, the nose and lung are in harmony, enabling the nose to distinguish fragrance and stench. Its odor is rank, hence it is assessed through the nose. The lung desires acrid flavors, for acridity first enters the lung, but those with qi disorders should not consume much acrid food. If acrid flavors are overindulged, the sinews and vessels become slack, and the spirit weakens. Thus, excessive acridity causes sinew tension and withered nails.\n\nThe lung desires gathering; to gather it, consume sour flavors promptly. The lung desires dispersion; to disperse it, consume acrid flavors promptly. The lung suffers from counterflow of qi upward; to drain it, consume bitter flavors promptly. The lung detests cold, for cold is yin qi. Not only does it detest cold, but it also fears heat, for heat is the fire mandate. Joy injures the lung qi. When the spirit converges in the lung, sorrow also causes harm. The lung prohibits cold food, cold drink, and cold clothing. Furthermore, excessive drinking causes qi counterflow—if one drinks too much, the lung’s lobes lift, and qi counterflows upward in a rush.\n\nAll drinking and sexual activity must strictly avoid drafts. As Yaofu said, \"Pure joy is rare; even a slight deficiency should not be indulged. After three days of heavy drinking, never exceed five parts.\" Wang Lao said, \"When food and drink encroach upon the lung, phlegm and water surge upward, qi congests and fails to move, and the face breaks out in sores.\" It is said that when the lung is congested, the large intestine becomes obstructed. Thus, lung qi values cool clarity, and those with white complexions correspond to the lung.\n\nThe lung governs sound, and sound manifests as weeping. Its pathological movement is coughing. The Hand Greater Yin Lung Channel: the well point is Metal, *Shaoshang*, located two points on the inner tip of the thumb, a leek-leaf’s width from the corner of the nail. The spring point is Water, *Yuji*, two points on the inner side behind the thumb’s base joint, in the scattered vessels. The stream point is the root, *Taiyuan*, two points in the depression behind the palm; if the pulse is cut off here, death is untreatable.\n\nIt is said that the lung *shu* point is below the third vertebra on both sides, extending to the shoulders and back. The lung’s source point emerges at *Taiyuan*. The channel point is Fire, *Jingqu*, two points in the inch pulse. At the *gen* hour, human qi resides in the Hand Greater Yin Lung Channel, and at the *yin* hour, it also resides in the lung’s network vessels. *Xin* governs the right hand’s Greater Yin and also the lung *Zang*’s illnesses. *Wei* governs the sixth month, the right foot’s Lesser Yang, and human qi in the right side and head.\n\nThe uniting point is Earth, *Chize*, two points in the elbow crease. The lung’s vessel is *Tianfu*, located three body-inches above the inner side of the elbow’s posterior, below the armpit, where the moving pulse responds to the hand—this is the lung’s qi. The Hand Greater Yin Lung Channel begins in the middle burner, descends to connect with the large intestine, circles back along the stomach’s opening, ascends through the diaphragm to belong to the lung. From the lung system, it emerges horizontally from the armpit, follows the inner arm, running alongside the Lesser Yin Heart Governor. It descends anteriorly through the elbow, follows the inner upper bone of the arm, descends to the forearm, enters the inch opening, ascends to the fish border, and emerges at the thumb’s tip.\n\nThus, the lung pulse is floating and short—this is its norm. If the thief pulse is surging and large, severe illness arises. Therefore, the lung is the root source of qi. If qi and blood are disharmonious, the hundred diseases transform and arise. Qi and blood prefer warmth and detest cold, like snow in water, congealing and failing to disperse. The lung’s qi is cool and clear; the lung circulates *ying* and *wei*, and *ying* is the blood within yin and yang.\n\nIt is said that when essence and qi converge in the lung, sorrow arises. It is also said that joy and anger injure the qi. If evil qi resides in the lung, coughing moves the shoulders and back. In lung disease, one pants, coughs, and qi counterflows; the shoulders, back, and lower back ache; sweat appears; and the yin regions, thighs, knees, calves, shins, and feet all ache. In lung disease diagnosis, the lung corresponds to Metal, flourishes in autumn, and its pulse is like floating hair.\n\nThe lung is assessed through the nose, its sound is weeping, its odor is rank, its flavor is acrid, its fluid is nasal mucus, it nourishes the skin and hair, it stores qi, its color is white, its spirit is the *po*, and its channel is the Hand Greater Yin Lung, which pairs with the large intestine. The large intestine is the *Fu*, governing the exterior of the lung, while the lung is the *Zang* governing the interior.\n\nWhen lung qi is excessive, qi is in surplus and causes illness: panting, coughing, counterflow qi, shoulder and back pain, sweating, lower back and yin region pain, and pain in the abdomen, knees, calves, shins, and feet—this is lung qi repletion, and thus it should be drained. When lung qi is insufficient, one is short of breath and unable to catch the breath, the ears deafen, and the throat dries—this is lung qi deficiency, and thus it should be supplemented.\n\n**General Discussion of the Lung *Zang*:** Among the five *Zang*’s positions, the lung alone resides above. Thus, heavenly qi communicates with the lung. The lung governs the skin and hair and is the flowery canopy of the five *Zang*. Among the five agents, it is the *po*, and the *po* emerges and enters alongside essence. Among the five natures, it is righteousness, and righteousness overcomes things by decisive judgment. It opens at the nose, hence its fluid is nasal mucus. Nasal mucus follows weeping and precedes tears. Its sound is weeping, hence its emotion is sorrow. Sorrow is yin’s solemnity and the spirit’s bleakness.\n\nIts color being white corresponds to the number two. Its flavor being pungent arises from the completion of things. Thus, in heaven it is dryness, on earth it is metal, in sound it is *shang*, in odor it is rank—all bound to the numerological cycles and the categories of qi. Now, considering the channels and their exterior-interior relationships: the hand *Taiyin* is the lung channel, and the hand *Yangming* is the large intestine channel. These two channels form the *Zang-Fu* pair, united as exterior and interior.\n\nThe hand *Taiyin* channel has already been described above. Its branch emerges directly from behind the wrist, passes along the inner side of the next finger, and exits at its tip. When yin and yang are balanced, the channels and network vessels are harmonious and smooth, with fullness and emptiness naturally waxing and waning—no bias toward excess is observed. Once this balance is lost, illness arises. Excess is superabundance, and superabundance is disease. Deficiency is insufficiency, and insufficiency is also disease.\n\nDisease of superabundance is called lung repletion. Disease of insufficiency is called lung deficiency. The signs of lung repletion are wheezing, coughing, rising qi, pain in the shoulders and back, sweating, and pain in the yin thighs, knees, and channels. When lung repletion generates heat, there is panting, counterflow qi, and propped-up breathing. The hand *Taiyin* channel, assailed by heat qi, thus manifests the disease of lung repletion. In severe cases, the mouth is red and drawn taut, drinking is unrestrained, sores erupt on the back and body, and pain extends to the thighs, calves, and shins.\n\nIn lung heat disease, a chilling shudder arises in the fine hairs, with aversion to wind and cold, yellowing of the tongue, and generalized heat. When heat contends, there is wheezing, coughing, pain radiating through the chest and breast, inability to take deep breaths, unbearable headache, sweating, and cold. If qi counterflow occurs, death comes on *bing*-*ding* days; if dryness prevails, there is desiccation.\n\nAll qi oppression and stagnation pertain to the lung; all atrophy, wheezing, and retching pertain to the upper. In lung heat, the right cheek reddens first, and later the complexion turns white with hair loss. In lung wind, the eyebrows whiten. When wind evil invades during autumn’s *geng*-*xin* days, it is called lung wind. The signs of lung wind are profuse sweating, aversion to wind, a pale complexion, frequent coughing, and shortness of breath—improving by day but worsening at dusk. Diagnosis lies in the area above the eyebrows, where the color is white.\n\nIf the lung happens to be replete, it is fitting to use medicinals and pungent flavors to drain it. Employ the method of raising the chin, tilting the head back, and exhaling to treat it—without allowing the ears to hear. If the lung *Zang* is deficient and weak, injured by wind evil, then clear cold qi ascends to attack, causing a runny nose with clear mucus. This is because the lung opens at the nose and its fluid is nasal mucus. In cases of deficiency, sour flavors are used to supplement it.\n\nIn general, the method for treating repletion is to drain, and for deficiency, to supplement. For superabundance, reduce; for insufficiency, augment. This is the general outline.\n\nThe *Profound Dao of the Abyssal Source, Continuation of the Wondrous Cavern-Truth, Middle Scroll*\nCollected Explications by Disciple Li Jingyuan of the Gate of True Origin\n\nNow, in the first month of autumn, when the Dipper’s handle points to *Mengqiu*, the hexagram *Pi* governs, and the pitch-standard aligns with *Yize*. The Dao of Heaven moves northward; its image above is the Palace of Yin and Yang, and below, *Jin*. Its qi resides in the human gallbladder.\n\nThe gallbladder is the official of central rectitude, whence decisions and judgments emerge. Thus, it is the *Fu*-viscus of central essence. The Foot Lesser Yang Gallbladder Channel begins at *Jing-Well Metal* at *Qiaoyin*, two points located at the tips of the fourth and fifth toes, a leek-leaf’s width from the nail. *Ying-Spring Wood* at *Xiaxi* lies between the fourth and fifth toes, anterior to the metatarsophalangeal joint. *Shu-Stream Wood* at *Linqi* resides in the depression posterior to the metatarsophalangeal joint of the fourth and fifth toes, one and a half *cun* from *Xiaxi*. Some texts locate *Danshu* beneath the tenth vertebra, bilaterally—the origin of the gallbladder’s source. *Qiuxu*, two points below the lateral malleolus, mirrors the above. Three *cun* from *Linqi*. *Jing-River Fire* at *Yangfu* lies four *cun* above the lateral malleolus, anterior to the fibula, at the terminus of the *Juegu* bone, three *fen* as before.\n\nAt the *Ren* hour of night, the human qi resides in the Foot Lesser Yang Gallbladder Channel. By the *Zi* hour, it also dwells in the gallbladder’s network-vessels. *Jia* governs the left-hand Lesser Yang and also the disorders of the gallbladder *Fu*. *Shen*—the seventh month—governs the right-foot Lesser Yin, and the human qi concurrently resides in the right [side] with the lung. *He-Sea Earth* at *Yanglingquan*, two points in the depression one *cun* below the knee’s lateral aspect, where the gallbladder’s vessel connects to the kidney.\n\nThe Foot Lesser Yang Gallbladder Channel arises at the outer canthus of the eye, ascends to the corner of the forehead, descends behind the ear, follows the head anterior to the Hand Lesser Yang, reaches the shoulder, crosses posterior to the Hand Lesser Yang, and enters the supraclavicular fossa.\n\nIn gallbladder disease, one frequently sighs deeply, experiences a bitter taste in the mouth, and vomits stale fluid. The heart feels unsettled, as if someone were about to seize them, and the throat emits a rasping sound. Frequent spitting occurs, for the gallbladder’s movement manifests as vomiting, and its qi is courageous, hence vomiting.\n\nThe gallbladder’s disease correspondences: its image is Wood, it flourishes in spring, and its channel is the Foot Lesser Yang. It is the *Fu*-viscus of the liver, whence planning and deliberation arise. All *Fu*-viscera defer to the gallbladder for decisions. When its qi is exuberant and superabundant, disease arises within the abdomen—distress and restlessness, with the body trembling subtly. This is repletion of gallbladder qi, and draining is appropriate.\n\nWhen gallbladder qi is insufficient, its qi ascends and overflows, causing a bitter taste in the mouth, frequent deep sighs, vomiting of stale fluid, an unsettled feeling beneath the heart as if someone were about to seize them, a rasping sensation in the throat, and frequent spitting. This is deficiency of gallbladder qi, and supplementation is appropriate.\n\nIt is said: The gallbladder is the *Fu*-viscus of the liver, the Yang Foot Lesser Yang Channel. When insufficient, the gallbladder is deficient. Deficiency engenders cold, and cold gives rise to disease—fearfulness, inability to sleep alone, dizziness in the mouth and head, flaccid paralysis of the feet and toes so they cannot be moved, inability to rise from sitting, sudden collapse with fixed gaze, and a vacant demeanor. For when the gallbladder is deficient, the spirit is not secured, and its qi ascends and overflows, following its location to generate disease.\n\nIt is said: When the gallbladder is replete, it is superabundant. Superabundance engenders heat, and heat causes the spirit to be unsecured—chest oppression and vexation, dry throat, vomiting of bitter fluid, and somnolence day and night. Furthermore, abdominal qi fullness, inability to swallow food, dryness in the heart and rib-side pain preventing turning, heat on the lateral aspect of the foot—this is Yang reversal. Also, headache, pain at the outer canthus, swelling and pain in the supraclavicular fossa, swelling beneath the axilla, and *Madian Xieying* [nodules along the neck]—all are termed repletion of gallbladder qi, obstruction of the Foot Lesser Yang Channel.\n\nFor the patterns of gallbladder *Fu* deficiency and repletion, the methods of supplementation and draining, and the appropriate formulas, they are the same as those for the liver *Zang*’s exterior and interior.\n\nAs the month progresses to *Shen*, *You*, and *Xu*, it remains autumn. Autumn qi moves eastward, and autumn qi resides in Yang. Autumn flourishes in the lung, and it governs *Geng* and *Xin*.\n\n*Geng* governs the Lesser Yin of the right hand, while *Xin* governs the Greater Yin of the right hand—thus autumn qi begins above and then commences on the right. Some say it begins in the front, others in the rear. In the seventh and eighth months, human qi resides on the right with the lung; in the ninth month, it remains on the right with the heart. Autumn qi dwells in the skin and the pores of the hair, its transport points lying in the shoulders and back. When autumn qi prevails, illness arises in the lung. Autumn is injured by dampness, which ascends in counterflow to provoke coughing and atrophy reversal. Autumn qi is prone to wind-malaria; autumn injured by dampness gives rise to winter coughs. Thus, in autumn, the lung is treated with warmth yet paradoxically with coolness. The stomach qi serves as the root in autumn. The stomach is the root of the five *zang*. Only in autumn does one nourish Yin, and it is fitting to consume warming foods. When the season calls for coolness, one may distance oneself from cold. Those who follow this prosper; those who oppose it fall ill.\n\nIn regulating the spirit according to autumn qi, the pulse should be light as a feather—this is the norm. Deviation from this indicates illness. Only the sage possesses the method of following Heaven to nurture life, rising early and retiring early with the rooster, gathering and restraining the spirit and qi. Thus autumn qi is harmonized, the mind is not scattered, and the lung qi remains clear. This is the correspondence of autumn qi and the Way of nurturing harvest.\n\nNext comes *He Kui*, which precisely marks the mid-autumn month. The *Guan* hexagram of *You* aligns with the *Nan Lü* pitch. The celestial Way moves northeast; its image above is the Metal Ox Palace, below it is Zhao, and its qi resides in the human stomach. The stomach is rectitude. The spleen and stomach are the officials of the granary, from which the five flavors emerge. The spleen is the *zang*, the stomach the *fu*; the two qi of spleen and stomach stand as exterior and interior to one another, forming the *fu* of the five grains, the sea of water and grain, governing the reception and containment of food and drink. When the spleen qi grinds and dissolves, one can eat. Yet if both spleen and stomach qi are deficient, one cannot consume food or drink. This stems from overburdening the intestines and stomach with food and drink. Only those who follow the Way traverse the four seasons of Heaven and regulate the five *zang* of humanity, all with stomach qi as the root. If the qi of the *Chongyang* pulse is severed, death is untreatable.\n\nThe Foot Yangming Stomach Channel’s well point, Metal, is *Lidui*, two points located at the tip of the second toe, a leek-leaf’s width from the nail. Its spring point, Wood, is *Neiting*, two points in the depression between the first and second toes. Its stream point, Wood, is *Xiangu*, two points in the depression proximal to the second toe’s metatarsophalangeal joint, two *cun* from *Neiting*. The stomach transport point lies below the twelfth vertebra, bilateral. Its source emerges at *Chongyang*, two points five *cun* above the ankle on the dorsum of the foot, between the bones where the pulse is felt, three *cun* from *Xiangu*. Its river point, Fire, is *Jiexi*, two points one and a half *cun* posterior to *Chongyang*, in the depression above the wrist.\n\nAt *Yi* hour of the day, human qi resides in the Foot Yangming Stomach Channel. By *Chen* hour, it also dwells in the stomach’s network vessels. *Wu* governs the Greater Yang of the right hand and also governs illnesses of the stomach *fu*. *You* serves as the weft; in the eighth month, it governs the Greater Yin of the right foot, and human qi also resides on the right, in the lung.\n\nThe earth confluence is *Zusanli*, two points three *cun* below the knee, in the depression between the lateral bone and the great tendon. The Foot Yangming Stomach Channel begins at the junction of the nose and forehead, alongside the Taiyang Channel, descending along the lateral nose into the upper teeth, curving around the mouth to intersect at *Chengjiang*, then retreating along the posterior lower jaw to emerge at *Daying*. It ascends along *Jiache* to the front of the ear, passing *Kezhuren*, following the hairline to the forehead.\n\nThe stomach’s disease manifestations: the stomach corresponds to earth, flourishing in late summer, and its channel is the Foot Yangming. It is the *fu* of the spleen and the sea of water and grain. All *zang* and *fu* receive the qi of water and grain from the stomach. When qi is exuberant and in excess, it causes abdominal distension and fullness—this is repletion of stomach qi, and draining is appropriate. When stomach qi is insufficient, one is hungry yet cannot receive water or grain, suffering from undigested diarrhea and counterflow vomiting—this is deficiency of stomach qi, and supplementation is appropriate.\n\nThe discourse on stomach deficiency and cold: the Foot Yangming Stomach Channel and the Foot Taiyin form exterior and interior. Its qi favors warmth and detests cold; when warmed, it transforms water and grain. If its qi is insufficient and cold qi invades, it causes shin cold, inability to lie down, aversion to wind, shivering, eye tension, constant abdominal pain, bilateral rib-side emptiness and distension with frequent rumbling, alternating cold and heat, dry lips and mouth, facial and periorbital swelling, and inability to consume food—all due to stomach cold.\n\nThe discourse on stomach repletion and heat: when stomach qi is exuberant and replete, it becomes congested and unsmooth, accumulating to generate heat. This causes dry mouth, vexing thirst, universal yellowing of the face and eyes, delirious raving, manic agitation, generalized heat with profuse sweating, abdominal and rib-side firmness and fullness, and constipation—all its signs. Moreover, stomach qi takes food as its root, yet the five grains, fruits, and vegetables suffice for nourishment; one must not overindulge and harm one’s upright qi. Among these, meat is not mentioned, for it is forbidden by Daoists. Thus the old saying of Liu: “The Way lies in the glutton, a full belly and uninhibited urination—qi at ease.” Food is for nourishing the stomach, and the stomach communicates with the kidney, which is the stomach’s gate. Thus the *Yi*’s *Yi* hexagram speaks of nourishment. The noble person is cautious in speech and moderates food and drink—this is its meaning.\n\nWhen the Dipper points to the season of late autumn, the *Bo* hexagram of *Xu* aligns with the *Wu Yi* pitch. The celestial Way moves south; its image above is the White Sheep Palace, below it is Lu, and its qi resides in the human bladder. The bladder is the official of the reservoir, storing fluids and humors. When qi transforms, they can be discharged. It is the root of the granary and the dwelling of nourishment. Thus the kidney pairs with the bladder, both being the *fu* of fluids and humors. The classics state: the bladder stores fluids and humors, and when it receives the qi of the sea of qi to enact transformation, then urine and stool are discharged.\n\nIf the qi of the sea of qi is insufficient, then the passages become obstructed and impassable.\n\nThe Foot Greater Yang Bladder Channel begins at *Jing*-Metal as *Zhi Yin*, with two points located on the lateral side of the little toe, a scallion-leaf’s width from the corner of the nail. Its *Rong*-Wood is *Tong Gu*, with two points on the lateral side of the little toe, in the depression anterior to the metatarsophalangeal joint. Its *Shu*-Wood is *Shu Gu*, with two points on the lateral side of the little toe, in the depression posterior to the metatarsophalangeal joint. The Bladder *Shu* point lies below the nineteenth vertebra, bilateral to the spine. The Bladder’s *Yuan* point emerges at *Jing Gu*, with two points on the lateral side of the little toe, below the prominent bone at the junction of red and white flesh.\n\nIts *Jing*-Fire is *Kun Lun*, with two points posterior to the lateral malleolus, in the depression above the heel bone. At the *Kun* hour of the day, human qi resides in the Foot Greater Yang Bladder Channel. By the *Shen* hour, human qi also dwells in the Bladder’s network vessels.\n\n*Ren* governs the left hand’s Greater Yin and also rules Bladder disorders. *Xu*, the ninth month, governs the right foot’s Reverting Yin, while human qi resides on the right and also in the heart.\n\nIts *He*-Earth is *Wei Zhong*, with two points in the popliteal crease, in the depression where the pulsating tendon is felt. The Foot Greater Yang Bladder Channel begins at the inner canthus of the eye, ascends to the forehead, and intersects at the vertex. One branch extends from the vertex to the superior angle of the ear. Its straight course enters from the vertex to bind the brain, then emerges and descends along the nape, following the inner aspect of the scapula to parallel the spine, reaching the lumbar region and traveling through the sacrum to bind the kidneys.\n\nThe kidneys pertain to the bladder. When the bladder is diseased, the lower abdomen becomes unilaterally swollen and painful; pressing it induces an urge to urinate that cannot be fulfilled. Heat in the shoulders, sunken pulse, and heat along the lateral aspect of the little toe, calf, and posterior ankle—all indicate the exhaustion of fluids and humors.\n\nIn the pathology of bladder disorders: the bladder corresponds to water and flourishes in winter; the Foot Greater Yang is its channel. It is the *fu* of the kidneys. The essences of the five grains and five flavors all converge in the bladder. Through qi transformation, they enter the blood vessels to form bone marrow, while the surplus of fluids and humors enters the bladder to become urine.\n\nWhen its qi is exuberant and in excess, heat arises as disease. If the bladder is obstructed and urine cannot pass, with unilateral swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, this is bladder qi repletion—it should be drained. When the bladder is deficient, cold ensues; if cold qi invades, the bladder becomes slippery, and urination becomes frequent and copious. A black complexion indicates bladder qi deficiency—it should be supplemented.\n\nThe *Discourse on Bladder Deficiency and Cold* states: The bladder is the *fu* of fluids and humors. When qi transforms, they can be discharged. If its qi is insufficient, deficiency arises, and deficiency invites cold qi to exploit it, causing fluids and humors to flow unchecked. Thus, the symptoms include profuse urination, severe lower abdominal pain, and pain in the nape, back, lumbar region, sacrum, popliteal fossa, and [omitted]. When the bladder fails to restrain urine, leading to enuresis, this is due to bladder deficiency and cold, resulting in frequent urination.\n\nThe *Discourse on Bladder Repletion and Heat* states: The bladder is the official of the reservoir, storing fluids and humors. When qi transforms, they can be discharged. If its qi is in excess, repletion arises, and repletion causes heat qi to linger, leading to congestion and obstruction. Internally, this manifests as urinary retention, vexation, fullness, and restlessness. Externally, it presents as generalized heat, lumbar pain, and dizziness. Thus, when the bladder fails to facilitate urination, leading to *long* (dribbling urinary block), its supplementation and drainage [omitted] follow the same principles as those for the kidney channel.\n\nNow, when the celestial Dipper points to the first month of winter, *Hai* aligns with the *Kun* hexagram, and the pitch corresponds to *Ying Zhong*. The celestial Way moves east; its image above is the Double Fish Palace, below it is Wei, and its qi resides in the human liver.\n\nThe liver is a *zang*, the gallbladder its *fu*, corresponding to wood. Its nature is warmth, its qi mild, and its note *jue*. It flourishes in spring and in the days of *Jia* and *Yi*, wanes in autumn, and perishes in *Geng* and *Xin*. The liver is the official of the general, from which strategies and plans emerge. It is the dwelling of the *hun*. Its luster appears in the nails, its filling in the sinews, and it generates blood and qi. Yet prolonged walking injures the sinews, straining the liver.\n\nWhen the liver is strained, the face and eyes become dry and dark, the mouth bitter, the spirit unsettled, and one feels fearful, unable to sleep alone, with dim vision. It is also said that great anger causes qi counterflow, injuring the liver; when the liver is injured, blood becomes scant, and the eyes darken. The liver generates anger, and anger injures the liver—thus, violent rage harms *yin* and also injures qi.\n\nWhen the liver is diseased, pain arises beneath the ribs, radiating to the lower abdomen, and one becomes prone to anger. Thus, resentment, anger, and qi counterflow that ascend without descending injure the liver. The liver opens at the eyes, manifests in the eyes, its color is green, its humor is tears, its odor is rank, and its flavor is sour. Sour flavor first enters the liver; the liver desires sourness, but excessive consumption of sourness causes the flesh to thicken and the lips to peel.\n\nThe liver suffers from tension; to relieve it, one should eat sweetness. Thus, those with liver disease should avoid pungent flavors. When the *zang* and *fu* of a person are about to become diseased, their changes and movements must manifest in countenance, complexion, and voice.\n\nWhen the liver is hot, the left cheek first reddens; if it appears green and the nails wither, this is liver wind causing the eyes to turn green. The inner canthus of the eye is *Jing Ming*, where the Hand and Foot Greater Yang, Foot Yang Brightness, Yin Heel, Yang Heel, and five vessels converge. In *jue* syndrome, the eyes see nothing; in *jue*, yang qi converges above, and yin qi converges below. When yang converges above, fire shines alone; when yin converges below, the feet become cold, and cold causes distension.\n\nAs one water cannot overcome five fires, the inner canthus becomes blind—this \"one water\" refers to the eye, while the \"five fires\" denote the *jue* yang of the five *zang*. All sinews pertain to the eyes, thus the liver nourishes the sinews. The sinews regard the knees as their *fu*; thus, all sinews gather at the genitals, and the channel terminates at the root of the tongue. Some say it binds at the tongue.\n\nThe liver’s changes and movements manifest in cries, shouts, whistling speech, yawning, stretching, and grasping.\n\nThe Foot *Jueyin* Liver Channel: its *jing-well* (Wood) point is *Dadun*, with two points located at the tip of the big toe, a leek-leaf’s width from the nail. Its *ying-spring* (Fire) point is *Xingjian*, with two points on the big toe. The moving pulse responds here. Its *shu-stream* (Earth) point is *Taichong*, located two *cun* (or one and a half *cun*) behind the base joint of the big toe, in the moving pulse. If the pulse ceases here, death follows—it is incurable. The Liver Transport point lies below the ninth vertebra, on either side. The Liver’s *yuan-source* point emerges at *Taichong*. Its *jing-river* (Metal) point is *Zhongfeng*, with two points located one *cun* anterior to the inner ankle; they are accessed with the foot supine. At *gui* hours each night, the human *qi* resides in the Foot *Jueyin* Liver Channel. By *chou* hours, the *qi* also lingers in the Liver’s network vessels. *Yi* governs the left hand’s *Taiyang* and also rules Liver *zang* illnesses. *Hai* (the tenth month) governs the left foot’s *Jueyin* and the human *qi*, which also resides in the Heart. Its *he-sea* (Water) point is *Ququan*, with two points located below the inner knee, above the large sinew and below the small sinew in the depression. The Liver’s Foot *Jueyin* Channel begins at the hairy region of the big toe, ascends along the instep, passes one *cun* above the inner ankle, rises eight *cun* above the ankle to cross behind the *Taiyin*, then ascends along the inner knee, follows the inner thigh into the pubic hair, encircles the genitals, reaches the lower abdomen, flanks the stomach, connects to the Liver, and networks with the Gallbladder.\n\nThe balanced pulse of the Liver and Gallbladder is wiry; its predatory pulse is floating. The Liver’s *qi* is warm, harmonizing the *qi* of the Liver *zang* and sinew membranes. Thus, when evil resides in the Liver, both flanks ache, cold invades, and static blood moves internally, often causing spasms in the hands, swollen feet, and knots in the joints. Liver disease manifests in fright and terror, affecting the sinews. The Liver is forbidden to wind; it not only despises wind but also fears clarity—clarity is the command of Metal. The Liver governs spring, and its pulse is wiry and long—this is the Liver’s balanced pulse. If the pulse is deep, floating, and slippery, it is the Liver’s predatory pulse, indicating Liver *qi* deficiency. Deficiency generates cold; cold causes hardness beneath the flanks, blurred vision, black spots in the eyes, cramping sinews, a greenish complexion, brittle nails, melancholy, and fear, with an inability to sigh deeply. In severe cases, one feels constant dread, as if about to be seized. These are all signs of Liver deficiency. Excess generates heat and yang hyperactivity, leading to hardness and fullness below the heart, eye pain, red canthi, stiff neck and back, sinew spasms preventing flexion and extension. In severe cases, one becomes irascible and prone to anger—these are signs of Liver excess.\n\n**Discourse on Liver Disease Signs:**\nThe Liver resembles Wood and flourishes in spring. Its pulse is wiry, its spirit is the *hun*, its indicator is the eyes, its luster is in the nails, its filling is in the sinews, its sound is shouting, its odor is rank, its flavor is sour, its fluid is tears, its color is green, it stores blood, and its channel is the Foot *Jueyin*. It pairs with the Gallbladder to form a *fu* and governs the exterior. The Liver is a *zang* that governs containment; when Liver *qi* is abundant, it becomes blood. Excess causes disease: red eyes, pain beneath both flanks radiating to the lower abdomen, and frequent anger. If *qi* rebels, dizziness, deafness, swollen cheeks, and impaired hearing follow—this is Liver *qi* excess, and purging is appropriate. If Liver *qi* is insufficient, disease arises: blurred vision, cramping in both flanks, sinew spasms, inability to sigh deeply, brittle nails, a greenish complexion, melancholy, and fear as if about to be seized—this is Liver *qi* deficiency, and tonifying is appropriate.\n\nIn Liver heat disease, urine first turns yellow, the abdomen aches, and one sleeps excessively. When heat contends, delirium and fright follow, with fullness and pain in the flanks, restless limbs, and inability to sleep peacefully. The limbs are the root of all yang. If *qi* rebels, headache follows, with a throbbing pulse drawing upward to the head—rebellion here is akin to *jue*. The *Jueyin* Wood’s wind transformation engenders movement. Thus, when wind prevails, movement arises. Wind’s harm to humans is swift and ever-changing: when the interstices open, cold chills arise; when cold closes, heat and oppression follow. Wind injury in spring’s *jia-yi* days is called Liver wind. Liver wind’s signs include profuse sweating, aversion to wind, melancholy, a slightly greenish complexion, dry throat, frequent anger, and occasional hatred of women. Diagnosis lies beneath the eyes, where the color is green.\n\n**Discourse on Liver Disease and Sinew Spasms:**\nLiver disease with sinew spasms occurs because the Liver unites with the sinews. When the Foot *Jueyin* Channel is insufficient, the vessels fail to nourish. Without nourishment, wind evil easily invades, contending with the sinews and vessels, causing spasms and contractions. Moreover, the Liver stores wind toxin, and *qi* pours into the arms, head, neck, shoulders, back, waist, and feet, causing sinew spasms, cramping, piercing pain, or swollen limbs, dizziness, black spots obscuring vision, vomiting, hiccups, and reduced appetite. Generally, facial swelling is called wind—wind is yang *qi*. Thus, all wind tremors and dizziness belong to the Liver, and all sudden rigidity belongs to wind.\n\n**Wind Strike:**\nWind strike occurs when wind *qi* invades a person. Wind is the *qi* of the four seasons, distributed across the eight directions, governing the growth and nourishment of all things. Wind coming from its native direction causes few deaths or illnesses. Wind from non-native directions causes many deaths and illnesses. When it causes disease, it lurks between the skin and flesh, internally unable to penetrate and externally unable to disperse. When it enters the channels and vessels, moving through the five *zang*, it generates disease in each *zang* and *fu* accordingly. In Liver wind strike, one can only squat and cannot lower the head. If greenish color encircles both eyes and extends to the forehead, with greenish lips and a yellowish face, it is treatable. There is also *xi* wind and fan wind, which strike people subtly.\n\nSevere wind escalates into *li* wind, where wind-cold lingers in the vessels without departing—this is called *li* wind. It may also be named cold-heat. Thus, all winds归属于liver wind, the origin of the hundred diseases. Like bandit winds that strike repeatedly, or vacuous evils that assail morning and night, one must avoid them as one would avoid arrows and stones. When the liver is replete, drain it with sour; employ *xu* qi to [treat] its vacuity, and supplement it with acrid. Avoid drafts—this is the model of nurturing life.\n\nAs the seasonal nodes shift, the months of *hai*, *zi*, and *chou* remain winter, when winter *qi* moves south. In the tenth month, human *qi* resides on the left with the heart; in the eleventh and twelfth months, it also lies on the left with the kidneys. Winter *qi* begins at the *biao* (exterior), which is both the head and the tail. Some say it begins at the front, with winter *qi* in the bone marrow, its *shu* points at the waist and thighs—the waist being the palace of the kidneys. Winter *qi* resides in the kidneys and also in the yin, affecting the four limbs. In winter, one is prone to *bi* impediment and reversal, while yang diseases arise in winter.\n\nIn the eleventh month, human *qi* lies on the left with the kidneys. Moreover, winter rules the kidneys, corresponding to *ren* and *gui*. *Ren* governs the left hand’s Greater Yin, while *gui* governs the right hand’s Lesser Yin. Winter takes stomach *qi* as its root, so in winter, one nurtures yin and should eat warming foods. To treat the kidneys with heat yet counter with cold at this time—there are methods for harmonizing the spirit: rise late and retire early, awaiting sunlight, avoiding cold and seeking warmth, and not allowing sweat to leak from the skin. This is winter’s response to the Dao of storing and nurturing.\n\nIf one does not distance oneself from cold, cold will arrive; when cold arrives, hardness and blockage ensue, giving rise to abdominal fullness, pain, urgency, and diarrhea. Its pulse is like stone. To act contrary is to invite illness. Thus, heaven employs cold, and one may distance oneself from cold. Following this preserves life; opposing it harms the kidneys. The kidneys loathe dryness and also fear dampness—dampness being the *qi* of earth.\n\nIf one is harmed by cold in winter, one will surely contract warm disease in spring. Among the hundred diseases of humanity, none is greater than harm from cold. Its patterns: on the first day, Greater Yang receives it; on the second, Yang Brightness receives it; on the third, Lesser Yang receives it; on the fourth, Greater Yin receives it; on the fifth, Lesser Yin receives it; on the sixth, Reverting Yin receives it. By the seventh day, Greater Yang’s disease wanes; by the eighth, Yang Brightness’ disease wanes; by the ninth, Lesser Yang’s disease wanes; by the tenth, Greater Yin’s disease wanes; by the eleventh, Lesser Yin’s disease wanes; by the twelfth, Reverting Yin’s disease wanes. This is the waxing and waning transmission among the twelve channels. If contrary, three cycles will pass before it ceases. These three cycles refer to the three yin and three yang channels of the hands and feet.\n\nOnly the perfected of antiquity did not contract warm disease in spring, for they stored essence in the kidneys. Essence is the root of the body. The *Classic* states: \"Essence, blood, nature, and life are one with the Dao.\" Thus, the sage treasures essence, for essence is most true. From ancient times to the present, those called \"true persons\" excel at being unborn and untransformed, merging with the Dao as one. This is what is meant by \"not being transformed into a human.\" They can transform others, but if one nurtures life and honors existence, not contracting warm disease is profound—this is called \"wondrous truth.\"\n\nAs the shadow shifts and the Dipper moves, the proper alignment of the mid-winter month is *zi*, where the *Fu* hexagram’s first nine yang line is born, revealing the heart of heaven and earth. This remains winter, and at this juncture, in the north of *Kan*, the Dark Heavenly Thearch manifests boundless transformations, presiding over the karmic retribution of good and evil in the human realm, its influence clear as echo and shadow. The pitch corresponds to Yellow Bell.\n\nThe Dao of heaven binds the southeast; its image above is the Precious Cauldron Palace, and below, the state of *Qi*. Its *qi* resides in the human kidneys. The kidneys are the *zang*, the bladder the *fu*; their phase is water, their nature severe, their *qi* cold. Bitter cold harms the form. Their note is *yu*, they rule in winter, are cut off in the *ji* season, and die on *wu* and *ji* days.\n\nThe kidneys are the official of strength and skill, from which ingenuity arises. They are the dwelling of essence. Their luster is in the hair, their filling in the bone marrow. The kidneys have two lobes: the left is the kidney that stores will, where joyful will and spirit guard within; the right is the life-gate that stores essence. The kidneys are yin *qi*, the root of the five *zang*, governing the body’s bones, marrow, and teeth. Teeth are the root of bones, also called the surplus of bone. Yet standing too long harms the bones, straining the kidneys.\n\nWhen the kidneys are taxed, the back is difficult to bend or raise, urination is unsmooth, the color is reddish-yellow with lingering dribbling, the penis aches internally, the genitals are damp, sores appear on the scrotum, and the lower abdomen is full and tense. It is also said: exerting strength to lift heavy objects or sitting too long on damp ground harms the kidneys. When the kidneys are harmed, essence is scant, the waist and back ache, and reversal cold ensues.\n\nThe kidneys open at the ears and the anterior and posterior yin. Their condition is observed at the ears. Their color is black, their fluid is saliva, their odor is putrid, their flavor is salty. Salty first enters the kidneys; the kidneys desire salty, but salty courses through the blood. In blood disease, do not eat much salt. Eating too much salt causes the vessels to congeal, the complexion to darken, and the flesh to contract, while heart *qi* rebels and great bone *qi* is affected.\n\nTaxing the kidneys values nurturing the bones, so kidney yin disease arises in the bones. If one cannot stand or walk for long, the bones will tremble and weaken. If one then overexerts, kidney *qi* is harmed, and the high bones are damaged. Those who attain strength live; those who lose it die. The kidneys desire firmness, so eat bitter to firm them. Bitter supplements, salty drains. The kidneys suffer from dryness and urgency, so eat acrid to moisten them. The kidneys loathe dryness and also fear dampness—dampness being the *qi* of earth.\n\nWhen essence and *qi* converge in the kidneys, fear arises. The kidneys generate fear, and fear harms them. The kidneys forbid scorched, scalding hot food, warm grilled clothing, or heated garments. If there is illness, ask what flavors the patient desires to know the disease’s origin. In kidney disease, observe the complexion externally.\n\nGreenish-black indicates pain; white indicates cold.\nWhen the kidneys are hot, the cheeks flush red—the area below the mouth is the cheek.\nIn kidney heat, the complexion is black and the teeth wither; one speaks of \"withered teeth.\"\nWhen kidney *qi* is affected by wind, the muscles darken, extending to the skin.\nKidney *qi* connects to the ears; when the kidneys are harmonious, the ears can hear the five sounds.\nIn kidney disease, the voice changes, manifesting as yawning (yin) or sneezing (yang), groaning, shivering, and trembling.\n\nEach of the five viscera has its own essence, which flows and pours into the kidneys.\nThe kidneys serve as the capital and the gatekeeper’s post.\nThe foot *Shaoyin* kidney channel: its *jing-well* (wood) point is *Yongquan* (Bubbling Spring), two points located in the depression at the center of the sole, found by curling the toes.\nIts *ying-spring* (fire) point is *Rangu* (Blazing Valley), two points in the depression anterior to the ankle, below the prominent bone.\nIts *shu-stream* (earth) point is *Taixi* (Great Ravine), two points posterior to the medial malleolus, in the depression above the heel bone.\nIf the pulse is cut off, death follows; it is incurable.\nAnother *shu* point lies below the fourteenth vertebra, on either side.\n\nThe kidney’s *yuan-source* emerges at *Daxi* (Great Ravine); its *jing-river* (metal) point is *Fuliu* (Returning Current), two points two *cun* above the medial malleolus.\nAt *geng* hours during the day, the human *qi* resides in the foot *Shaoyin* kidney channel.\nBy *you* hours, the human *qi* also dwells in the kidney’s network vessels.\n*Gui* governs the left hand’s *Shaoyin*, and its *qi* also governs kidney visceral diseases.\n*Zi* corresponds to the eleventh month of the year, governing the left foot’s *Taiyin*, and the human *qi* resides in the left side and in the kidneys.\n\nIts *he-sea* (water) point is *Yingu* (Yin Valley), two points posterior to the medial condyle of the tibia, between the large tendon below and the small tendon above.\nThe foot *Shaoyin* channel courses through the chest as the *Shaoyin* winter pulse.\nIt begins beneath the little toe, slanting toward the sole, emerging below the *Rangu* bone, following the posterior aspect of the medial malleolus, branching into the heel, ascending along the inner calf, emerging at the medial side of the popliteal fossa, then traveling up the posterior thigh, penetrating the spine, connecting to the kidneys and linking with the bladder.\n\nThe balanced kidney pulse is deep, hidden, and moderate. In people, the pulse is often insufficient.\nIf form and *qi* are unharmed but the pulse is excessive, death follows.\nIf form and *qi* are insufficient but the pulse is unharmed and excessive, life continues.\nThe pulse governs life and death—how vast its significance!\n\nThe twenty-four types of pulses serve as the essential framework:\nThe *floating pulse* is yang. It indicates heat, pain, vomiting, distension, obstruction, panting, reversal, internal binding, fullness, and inability to eat.\nThe appearance of the floating pulse resembles duckweed on water or floating clouds in the wind.\n\nThe *hollow pulse* vanishes upon pressure but returns when lifted.\nThus, dribbling, roughness, and pain arise from blood loss.\n\nThe *surging pulse* indicates distension, fullness, pain, heat, and vexation.\nIt resembles water flowing together, waves surging and rising.\n\nThe *slippery pulse* indicates vomiting, fullness, cough, heat, hidden phlegm, retained food, blood stasis, menstrual blockage, possession, and *qi* and blood excess.\nSince all are replete, it slides like pearls.\n\nThe *rapid pulse* indicates heat, deficiency, vomiting, pain, vexation, thirst, and fullness.\n\nThe *skipping pulse* relates to *qi*, blood, fluids, food, and phlegm.\nThus, yang excess causes skipping, while yin excess causes binding.\n\nThe *wiry pulse* indicates cold, pain, fluids, malaria, water *qi*, central deficiency, reversal cold, cramping, and cold accumulations.\nWhen lifted, it feels taut like a drawn bowstring.\n\nThe *tight pulse* indicates cold, pain in the head, bones, and flesh, cough, and panting.\nAll tight pulses signify cold, resembling a twisted rope.\n\nThe *deep pulse* indicates repletion, water, cold, panting, concretions, and conglomerations.\n\nThe *hidden pulse* indicates cholera, mounting conglomerations, water *qi*, sloppy diarrhea, retained phlegm and food, *qi* surging upward, and foul pus penetrating the flesh.\n\nThe *soft pulse* indicates deficiency, impediment, spontaneous sweating, *qi* weakness, heaviness below, softness and weakness, internal heat with external cold, incontinence, and difficult urination.\n\nThe *leathery pulse* indicates fullness, urgency, and the struggle between deficiency cold and change.\nIt signifies departure from the old, a fixed and unyielding state.\n\nThe *replete pulse*: when pathogenic *qi* is abundant, it is replete; when essence is depleted, it is deficient.\n\nThe *faint pulse* indicates deficiency, weakness, nosebleed, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, cramping, central cold, faint weakness, and *qi* deficiency.\n\nThe *rough pulse* is yin. It indicates blood deficiency, sweating, *qi* insufficiency, reversal cold, dysentery, and heart pain.\nIf one does not drink, fluids are insufficient, the pulse pathways are obstructed, and the body becomes rough.\n\nThe *fine pulse* is extremely thin and soft—called *faint*—yet sharper than faint.\nWhen it is merely fine, it is termed *fine*.\nIt signifies true *qi* deficiency, aching shins, cold marrow, lack of strength, and essence depletion.\n\nThe *soggy pulse* is extremely soft, floating, fine, and soggy.\nIt resembles silk cloth in water, perceptible with a light touch.\nDue to blood deficiency, it cannot fill and solidify.\n\nThe *weak pulse* is weak and deficient.\nIt indicates wind-heat and spontaneous sweating.\nSince weakness governs yin, deficiency, and palpitations, it is so.\n\nThe *deficient pulse* indicates cold, deficiency, timidity, weakness, undigested food, and summerheat injury.\nIf innate essence is not secure, defense and nourishment lose their guard, *qi* and blood decline and deplete—how can the pulse not be soft, weak, and deficient?\n\nThe *scattered pulse*: when the six *fu* organs’ *qi* is cut off externally, the hands and feet grow cold, and *qi* surges upward to the five viscera.\nWhen cut off internally, there is uncontrolled diarrhea, and in severe cases, numbness.\nAll such pulses scatter; scattering means failure to gather—dangerous indeed.\n\nThe *moderate pulse*: below, it indicates wind, cold, weakness, impediment, pain, numbness, *qi* insufficiency, and dizziness.\n\nThe *slow pulse* indicates cold and pain. All yin conditions pertain to cold; when cold prevails, the pulse floats, water stagnates, and edema swells.\n\nThe *bound pulse* indicates phlegm, rheum, blood, and *qi*. Within the span of one day and night—13,500 breaths—a pulse that halts and then resumes may be called *bound*. It is also described as moving to and fro, gathering and then retreating, hence *bound*. When the four limbs grow sluggish and pain strikes intermittently, this is the affliction of the *bound pulse*.\n\nThe *intermittent pulse* arises when one organ fails and another takes its place. Its manifestations include emaciation, an inability to speak—clear signs of exhausted innate essence.\n\nThe *stirring pulse* indicates pain, fright, spasms, diarrhea, and terror. When yang seeks to descend but yin resists, or yin seeks to ascend but yang resists, the two forces contend, unable to move up or down. The pulse surges and strikes, rising abruptly—thus the form of the *stirring pulse* appears. Where yang stirs, yang is deficient; where yin stirs, yin is deficient.\n\nThe classics state: *The pulse determines life and death, governs all diseases, and regulates deficiency and excess—one cannot be ignorant of it.* To treat excess as excess and deficiency as deficiency is to harm the insufficient and augment the abundant—such a course leads clearly to death.\n\nNow, the etymology of *pulse*: the human pulse corresponds to the moon, governed by the single trigram *Kan*. As water and moon, it is marked by a dot—representing the high waters of the upper pool. The middle is the central pool, its waters deep and still. The lower is the surging pulse of the multitude. When the *ying* streams feed the great ravines, the three waters flow and irrigate, granting enduring longevity. This inexhaustible fluid nearly approaches the Dao.\n\nThe ancients taught: *The kidney’s meridians belong to water—this single drop from the upper pool has sustained me to this day.* The art of nurturing life lies in regulating *qi*. The kidney stores the *qi* of bone marrow; kidney *qi* is cold and biting. Cold is yin *qi*. When cold evil invades the kidney, it causes bone pain and yin impediment. Yin impediment resists palpation, brings abdominal distension, lumbar pain, difficult defecation, and intermittent dizziness with pain in the shoulders, back, neck, and nape.\n\nKidney disease manifests as swollen cheeks and throat, panting, coughing, heaviness of the body, night sweats, and aversion to wind. The kidney’s afflictions reach the small junctions of flesh and sinew, even to the bone marrow.\n\nThe kidney’s correspondences: it resembles water, rules in winter, and its pulse is stone-like and deep. Its orifice is the ear, its sound is groaning, its odor is putrid, its flavor is salty, its fluid is spittle, it nourishes the bones, its color is black, and its spirit is the will. It belongs to the Foot Lesser Yin meridian and pairs with the bladder. The bladder is the *fu* organ, governing the exterior; the kidney is the *zang* organ, governing the interior. When kidney *qi* flourishes, it becomes the will. In excess, it causes abdominal distension, undigested diarrhea, bodily swelling, panting, coughing, sweating, aversion to wind, dark complexion, and yellow urine—this is kidney *qi* in excess, and purging is required. When kidney *qi* is insufficient, it causes reversal cold in the limbs, lumbar and dorsal chill, chest pain, tinnitus or deafness—this is kidney *qi* in deficiency, and supplementation is required.\n\nA comprehensive discussion of the kidney: the Foot Lesser Yin meridian of the kidney and the Foot Greater Yang meridian of the bladder stand as exterior and interior. They rule in winter, resemble water, and their pulse is deep. They nourish the bone marrow, their spirit is essence and will, their orifice is the ear, their sound is groaning, their odor is putrid, their flavor is salty, their fluid is spittle, their color is black, and their *qi* is closed and stored. Thus, one should retire early and rise late, awaiting daylight, avoiding cold and seeking warmth, disturbing nothing. This is the Dao of nurturing the *zang* in accordance with yang. To oppose winter’s *qi* is to diminish yin’s storage, leaving kidney *qi* alone and sunken.\n\nIts symptoms include lower abdominal distension and fullness, yellow-red urine with lingering dribbling, frequent and painful urination—this is kidney excess. In kidney heat disease, lumbar pain arises first, followed by aching shins, bitter thirst, frequent drinking, and fever. Generally, winter brings cold damage, spring brings warm epidemics, and summer brings heat disease. When heat contends, the nape grows painful and stiff, the shins cold and aching, the feet hot, and speech is unwelcome. If the condition reverses, the nape pain becomes dull and indistinct.\n\nWhen kidney heat is in excess, it generates wind, darkening the skin and flesh. If in winter, *ren* and *gui* days, evil invades, it becomes kidney wind. The symptoms of kidney wind include profuse sweating, aversion to wind, facial swelling, spinal pain preventing upright posture, a sooty complexion, and difficulty with private matters. Diagnosis lies in the skin’s black hue—thus the kidney resembles water. Its *qi* is cold and biting, for cold is yin *qi*.\n\nWhen kidney evil enters the liver, tears turn cold; in excess, they congeal into weeping, accompanied by sinew spasms and tension, as well as bone pain. When the kidney transmits cold to the liver, it causes abscesses and shortness of breath. The liver stores blood; when cold enters, yang *qi* fails to disperse, so blood congeals and *qi* stagnates. When evil resides in the kidney, it causes bone pain and yin impediment. Yin impediment resists palpation, brings abdominal distension, lumbar pain, difficult defecation, and intermittent dizziness with pain in the shoulders, back, neck, and nape.\n\nGenerally, when wind, cold, and damp *qi* converge, they cause impediment. When cold prevails, the pulse floats, water stagnates, and edema swells. When kidney will and *qi* are insufficient, reversal *qi* surges upward. If kidney *qi* is assailed by evil, water cannot moisten downward, leading to desiccation and dryness—hence difficult defecation. All cold causes contraction and withdrawal, all belonging to the kidney. All reversal, constipation, and leakage belong to the lower body. All diseases where fluids are clear and cold belong to cold.\n\nIn treatment, avoid cold in cold seasons; if violated, cold arrives. When cold arrives, it hardens, causing abdominal fullness and pain, and urgent diarrhea arises. Thus, cold harms the form. If blockage and obstruction occur, with lumbar and dorsal stiffness, reduced appetite, and fatigue, this is kidney deficiency.\n\nIf a person suffers two internal insufficiencies—first, *long* disease with tens of urinations a day; second, the Greater Yin pulse faint and fine as a hair—then their death is clearly imminent.\n\nFor those with severe essence insufficiency, replenish with rich flavors. For those with physical insufficiency, warm with qi. Combining qi and flavor in ingestion can replenish essence and augment qi. For kidney deficiency, use bitter to tonify. For excess, use salty to purge. Thus, the methods for regulating qi involve blowing treatments, with restoration and peace as the aim—this is the general outline of the art.\n\nAs the year wanes and transforms, the cold stars conclude in the final month of winter, when the *chou* earthly branch governs the *Lin* hexagram, and the pitch aligns with *Great Regulator*. The celestial Dao moves westward; its image above is the *Grinding Palace*, below is *Wu*, and its qi resides in the human spleen. The spleen is the *zang*-organ, the stomach its *fu*-organ, both symbolizing earth. It flourishes in the late seasons, wanes in spring, and perishes in *jia-yi* days. Its note is *gong*, its color yellow, its nature both tranquil and harmonious. It nourishes the flesh, manifests in the lips, savors sweetness, emits fragrance, produces saliva, and expresses itself in song.\n\nThe spleen stores intention and generates thought; excessive thought harms the spleen. The spleen is the official of the granary and the root of the body’s encampment. When spleen qi converges, the five flavors emerge. Its bloom and glory appear in the four whites of the lips, and its fullness resides in the muscles. As human flesh corresponds to earth, prolonged sitting injures it, for the flesh labors on behalf of the spleen. When the spleen labors, the root of the tongue becomes stiff and bitter, making it difficult to swallow saliva.\n\nIt is also said that excessive fullness injures the spleen. When the spleen is injured, one tends to belch, desires to lie down, appears yellow in the face, and speaks with effort. Fatigue from food and exertion harms the spleen, which opens at the mouth; when the spleen is harmonious, one discerns the five grains. The spleen is the utmost yin within yin, its earthly position in the southwest, flourishing in the fourth month of each season—yet in winter, one should not lift the heels, as in the months of *chen*, *wei*, and *xu*.\n\nThose who cultivate life must attend particularly to the spleen. Craving sweetness, sweetness first enters the spleen and flesh. For those with flesh ailments, avoid excessive sweetness, for it causes bone pain and hair loss. The spleen desires moderation; consume sweetness to relax it. The spleen suffers from dampness; urgently consume bitter to dry it. The spleen forbids warm clothing, overfullness, damp ground, and wet garments. It detests dampness and fears wind, for wind is the command of wood.\n\nWhen essence and qi converge in the spleen, those who fear spleen heat exhibit yellow complexion and twitching flesh, with the nose reddening first. The nose occupies the center of the face, where earth flourishes. Its changes and movements manifest in song, joy, retching, belching, and swallowing sounds.\n\nThe Foot Greater Yin Spleen Channel begins at *Hidden White*, two points on the inner tip of the big toe, a leek-leaf’s width from the nail. Its fire spring is *Great Metropolis*, two points in the depression behind the big toe’s base joint. Its earth transport is *Great White*, two points in the depression below the inner ankle’s prominence. The spleen’s transport point lies below the eleventh vertebra on either side. Its source emerges at *Great White*. Its metal channel is *Shang Mound*, two points in the depression slightly anterior to the inner ankle. At *xun* (9–11 a.m.), human qi resides in the Foot Greater Yin Spleen Channel. By *si* (9–11 a.m.), qi also flows through the spleen’s network vessels. *Si* governs the Lesser Yang of the right hand, and its qi also governs spleen organ diseases. *Chou* (1–3 a.m.), the twelfth month, governs the Lesser Yin of the left foot, where human qi also resides in the left and in the kidneys.\n\nIts water convergence is *Yin Mound Spring*, two points below the knee on the inner side of the lower leg, beneath the auxiliary bone. The Foot Greater Yin Spleen Channel arises at the big toe’s tip, follows the inner white flesh of the toe, passes behind the ankle bone, ascends the anterior edge of the inner ankle, then the inner shin, crossing in front of the Jueyin to ascend the inner anterior thigh into the abdomen, where it connects to the spleen and networks the stomach. It ascends the diaphragm, flanks the throat, connects to the root of the tongue, and disperses beneath it.\n\nThus, the spleen’s balanced pulse is moderate; its perverse pulse is wiry. When the pulse deviates from constancy, qi follows. The spleen stores the qi of muscles and flesh. When spleen qi converges, if evil resides in the spleen, the stomach falls ill, and the muscles ache. The spleen’s disease affects the root of the tongue; thus, its transport point lies in the spine’s center.\n\nSpleen disease manifests as heaviness in the body, flaccid muscles, weak feet that cannot be lifted, and a tendency to cramp, with pain under the soles. The spleen’s correspondences: it symbolizes earth, flourishes in late summer, its pulse is moderate, its orifice the mouth, its sound song, its odor fragrance, its flavor sweetness, its fluid saliva, its nourishment the flesh, its color yellow, and it stores intention. The Foot Greater Yin is its channel, paired with the stomach, which is the *fu*-organ governing the exterior. The spleen is the *zang*-organ governing containment.\n\nWhen spleen qi is exuberant, it shapes the form; in excess, it causes illness: abdominal distension and fullness, inhibited urination, heaviness in the body, constant hunger, weak feet that cannot be lifted, a tendency to cramp, and pain under the soles—this is spleen qi excess, and purging is appropriate. When spleen qi is insufficient, the four limbs fail to function, with undigested food in diarrhea, vomiting, counterflow, abdominal distension, and borborygmi—this is spleen qi deficiency, and tonifying is appropriate.\n\nIn summary, the spleen resides in the center, flourishing in mid-summer and the fourth month of each season. Its pulse arrives large and moderate—this is the spleen’s balanced pulse. If it is deep, fine, and weak, the spleen is deficient. Deficiency causes abdominal fullness, undigested food, vomiting, diarrhea, inability to use the four limbs, shortness of breath, aversion to human voices, and dreams of insufficient food—all signs of spleen deficiency.\n\nWhen the yin pulse at the right *guan* position is tight and replete, the spleen is in excess. Excess manifests as heaviness in the body, inability to turn, heat and oppression in the chest, dry and scorched lips, cheek pain, heart vexation, throat discomfort, sores at the root of the tongue, deep and heavy speech, dreams of singing and music, and lassitude in the four limbs—these are signs of spleen excess.\n\nIn spleen heat disease, the head first feels heavy, the cheeks ache, the heart is vexed, the complexion turns green, and one desires to vomit with fever. Excessive heat relaxes the sinews, dissolves the bones, and melts the flesh. When heat contends fiercely, lumbar pain arises, making bending and lifting impossible, with abdominal fullness, diarrhea, pain in both cheeks, and counterflow—death occurs on *jia-yi* days.\n\nThe spleen governs the form. When form is in excess, there is abdominal distension with inhibited urination and defecation. The spleen abhors dampness; when dampness prevails, there is watery diarrhea, and in severe cases, water retention with edema and swelling. All swelling and fullness due to dampness pertain to the spleen. When the spleen is in excess, it generates wind. In late summer, injury by evil on *wu-ji* days gives rise to spleen wind. The signs of spleen wind include profuse sweating with aversion to wind, lassitude in the body, reluctance to move the four limbs, a pale and slightly yellow complexion, and loss of appetite. In diagnosis, observe the nose—its color is yellow, hence spleen wind manifests as a yellow nose. The nose occupies the center of the face, resembling the *kun* trigram’s yielding nature. The central region’s people eat a varied diet and do not labor, thus their illnesses often involve atrophy. They suffer from alternating chills and fever, and the appropriate treatment is daoyin, anmo, and daoyao exercises.\n\nThe above describes spleen diseases of excess, which should be drained with bitter flavors. The precise method lies in the regulation of qi: exhalation facilitates its flow. Inhalation follows yin inward, while exhalation follows yang outward. For spleen deficiency, it should be supplemented with sweet flavors. Additionally, one may raise the shoulders, retract the neck, and apply pressure with the feet. Here ends the *Yuan Yuan Dao Miao Dong Zhen Ji Pian*. Below follows *Yuan Yuan Dao Miao Dong Zhen Ji Pian Xia*.\n\nMaster Li Jingyuan of the True Origin Gate offers this commentary:\n\nThe physician Lu exhaustively examined the five viscera, noting that within the human throat lie three passages: one for food, one for qi, and one for water, each sequentially propelling the others. The passages for food and water share a single orifice, converging together into the stomach. The upper orifice leads to the lungs, connecting to the Greater Yin meridian, descending through the abdomen, reaching the spine’s center, then circling beneath the navel to join the Conception, Thoroughfare, and Governing Vessels at the Cinnabar Field—the sea of generative qi. Three inches below the navel, spanning four inches in width, it adheres between the spine and the two kidneys. Known also as the Great Sea, within its waters dwells a spirit-turtle that draws in primordial qi, circulating it upward past the navel, weaving through the stomach, penetrating the liver and diaphragm, and entering the lungs. Here, the ascending and descending qi facilitate the ebb and flow of breath, for this is the sole passage above the lungs. The passages for water and food both enter the stomach, entirely dependent on the qi of the Cinnabar Field to transform and transmute their essence. Water and grain separate into the pure and turbid, traversing the small and large intestines, where the interplay of yin and yang qi governs their transformation and transmission. When yang qi prevails, water and grain are refined; when yin qi dominates, the dregs remain unrefined, giving rise to cold and pain. This occurs when yang is obstructed by yin and fails to descend, or when yin, lacking yang, fails to ascend—such is the principle of yin and yang’s ascent and descent.\n\nBelow the throat, the two lobes of the lungs appear, serving as the Florid Canopy that shelters all the viscera. Beneath the lungs lies the heart, enveloped in a yellow fatty membrane of a reddish-yellow hue. The heart’s form is pointed, elongated, round, and flat, its color a blend of black, red, green, and yellow, with pores distinct and unalike. Below the heart lies the diaphragm, and beneath that, the stomach, coiled to hold several *sheng* of matter, encased in a yellow fatty membrane resembling a banner’s flame. To the left lies the liver with its two lobes, the shorter of which bears the gallbladder. Beside the stomach on the left rests the spleen, sharing its membrane, resembling horse liver in its reddish-purple hue. Below lies the small intestine, coiled in fifteen loops, gleaming and pure, transmuting and conveying matter. To the right lies the large intestine, coiled in sixteen loops, containing dregs and enveloped in yellow fat, clumped together. Below resides the bladder, also gleaming and pure, lacking any external orifice, entirely reliant on the process of transformation—whereby fluids enter as urine.\n\nThe *Inner Canon* states: “The bladder is the official of the reservoir; fluids are stored therein, and through qi transformation, they are expelled.” To the right lies the passage through which the large intestine expels its dregs. Of the five viscera’s true essence, only the kidneys serve as the root. When the kidneys are deficient, water is insufficient. Many resort to drying medicines, unaware of their harm, yet nothing surpasses nourishing them with flavors to supplement their essence. Alas, the lungs as the yin mother are now made clear. Having thoroughly examined the principles of the viscera and bowels, one may observe the reflections of the five viscera upon the back’s transport points, discerning the pathways of life and death. This is the sage’s method of reversing the Yellow River’s flow. Only by practicing this formula can one attain the principle of longevity.\n\nObserve the fourteenth vertebra below, on either side at a distance of one *cun* and five *fen*, where the two kidneys reside. Each is enveloped in yellow fat as a single mass, with two connecting bands serving as the kidneys’ great meridians. Passing behind the *Pingyi* point and beneath the spine, there lies a large bone at the spine’s end, roughly half a hand in size. Between them lie two points, the kidneys’ meridians. These ascend along the spine to the *Niwan* and *Naohu* within the brain—the sea of marrow. Should one master this art of circulation, preventing reckless leakage and reversing the flow to reach the *Niwan*, it becomes the Great Elixir, enabling longevity and enduring vision.\n\nThis Dao was attained by the Yellow Emperor, who thereby ascended to heaven. Later, Anqi Sheng lived for three thousand years, and Peng Zu for eight hundred, as recorded in the *Biographies of Divine Transcendents*. Thus, both ascension and extended life in the world are possible. The Radiant Master’s external elixir elucidates the subtle and profound, while the internal qi illuminates the source of fetal breathing. Though the effort may not span a full decade, others marvel at one’s agelessness, for the span of life already exceeds five cycles. One feels renewed, for within the body lies the path to heaven, and upon the back, who lacks the mark of transcendence? From the *Jiaji* to the crown, this is the direct route of cultivation. Frequently swallow the Jade Fluid of the Flowery Pond, and the Primordial Lord of the Purple Palace will send it upward. Constantly ensure qi penetrates the joints, and naturally, essence will fill and the Valley Spirit will abide.\n\nOnce the external medicine’s fire is understood, the internal elixir’s reverse flow is perpetually activated. Even if a thousand years pass before we meet again, you will appear as youthful as today. Do not say the Great Dao is difficult to comprehend—it is only that the stubborn refuse to learn immortality.\n\nMaster Liu expounded the Supreme Qi Formula. Some, afflicted by illness or suffering, may scoff at it in neglect, failing to grasp its profound workings. Misapplication yields no results, and thus they dismiss it. Recently, a woman possessed by a ghost was exorcised by a Junior Master, but the ghost turned and pursued him. Fleeing past the True Lord’s hall, the Teacher immediately perceived the situation and swiftly captured the ghost’s spirit. After the exorcism, they discussed the details. On that day, a *jiazi* day, the Junior Master had dispatched the *yichou* spirit generals and soldiers, who were thus repelled. The Teacher, however, employed the *jiazi* day’s own spirit generals and soldiers, thereby capturing the ghost. Thus, in the Orthodox Unity method, even a hair’s breadth of deviation leads to such outcomes—how much more so for the qi formula, where misapplication guarantees no results, inviting scorn and neglect.\n\nAmidst the vast expanse of scriptures, those seeking to exhaust the sources of illness find it swiftly daunting. Yet by distilling the essentials, clarifying symptoms becomes effortless upon opening the text. Is this not the very virtue of those who cultivate the body—to attain health and well-being, and to advance in the wondrous Dao of the True? How magnificent indeed!\n\nThe disciples of the True Origin School addressed the enlightened youths: To govern the heavens and punish evil, nothing surpasses transmitting the scriptures and exhorting goodness.\n\nOn the seventh day of the first lunar month in the *wuchen* year, reverently reflecting upon the Teacher, I recall how Confucius—the very paragon of the sages—still inquired of Laozi about rites and sought counsel from Chang Hong on music. How then could I, a fool, dare not honor my master? Especially when the master, in boundless benevolence, bestowed the *Scripture of Enlightenment*, which, in its essence, expounds the August Heavenly Worthy as the sovereign of the Way of ruler and minister, father and son.\n\nThus, when cultivated throughout the world, it speaks of the sagely ruler’s Way, prizing benevolence and love for all under heaven. When cultivated within a state, it speaks of the loyal minister’s Way, prizing reverence and obedience to superiors. When cultivated among ministers, it speaks of the Way of assisting governance, prizing respect, kindness, and righteousness. When cultivated within the family, it speaks of the filial and fraternal Way, prizing ritual, music, and harmony. When cultivated in the self, it speaks of the Way of emptiness and quiescence, prizing the preservation of harmonious qi. Only when none of these are lacking may one be deemed fit for the gate of the Wondrous True.\n\nNext was bestowed the *Scripture of Extended Models*, which reveals the August Teaching Lord who enlightens all beings. It begins with the standards of virtue and the Five Constants, proceeds to the nurturing of harmonious qi, and concludes with the precepts for luminous illumination and abiding in the world. Through unwavering diligence, one may attain union with the palace of the Wondrous True.\n\nFollowing this was the *Scripture of the True Origin*, which expounds the Lord of the True Origin, emphasizing the transformation of unwholesome traits. Through great compassion, one cultivates inner emptiness and non-action while outwardly manifesting numinous transformation for the benefit of all. Such is the practice rightly called the True Origin.\n\nThen was granted the *Scripture of the Great Cavern*, which reveals the August Emperor of the Mysterious and Infinitesimal Heavenly Palace, unfolding the dragon-script canon of the Great Cavern and bequeathing the phoenix-records of the True Origin’s precepts. Herein lies the mystery of the Feminine One and the secrecy of the Masculine One. Heaven and Earth attain clarity and tranquility through it; the sun and moon gain their luminous radiance; yin and yang ascend and flourish; and all beings endure in harmony. Should one study the Great Cavern, mastering the wondrous existence and true non-being, and harmonizing virtue and power, one merges with the Wondrous True.\n\nSubsequently were bestowed the *Charts and Writings of the Great Cavern* and the *Natural Chapters*, which declare that humans receive their nature from Heaven and Earth, and the Dao models itself upon spontaneity. All that has form yet lacks sentience arises from this singular source. Thus, the sage does not act before things do, nor does he precede them. Instead, he follows their natural course and extends it. As for the celestial patterns and charts, even the sun and moon adhere to their measures—how could great and small lack their proper bounds? All things that come into being possess them. Therefore, the myriad beings bear yin on their backs and embrace yang in their arms, harmonizing through the qi of the center. Those who attain harmony live; those who lose it—what can be said of them?\n\nFinally was granted the *Scripture of the Wondrous True*, which first clarifies the Lord of the Mysterious and Infinitesimal Heaven, transmitting the non-actional Dao of the Imperial One of the Empty Cavern and Wondrous True. It then expounds the life-generating virtue of the Lord of the Jade-Conserving Heaven, who bestows the Eastern Florescence and the Wondrous Existence. Lastly, it sets forth the teachings of the Lord of the Great Vermilion Heaven, spreading the numinous non-being and the singular transformation of the Primal Human. It further regulates the twelve meridians, prizing peace, harmony, and joy. Only then may one gather the Way of wondrous existence and the lineage of true non-being. Thus, the primordial qi becomes the foundation of life and transformation, and the yang spirit the mystery of transcendence. When virtue and power are harmonized, one is called the Wondrous True.\n\nThe above scriptures and models all transform beings, swiftly correcting wrongdoing and hastening them toward the good Way. For those who leave the household to cultivate the Dao, there are exalted and enlightened masters to guide them. For those who remain in the world to revere the True, are there not the celestial teachings to instruct them?\n\nThe Buddhist verse:\n*Bright moon divides its form, ever renewed in every place,*\n*Can the white-robed fall behind those who comprehend emptiness?*\n*Who says the laity hinder the cultivation of the Dao?*\n*Golden Grain once took the form of the Elder’s body.*\n\nWhen grasped in the heart, the foul *ilan* becomes the sandalwood tree. When the essence is lost, even nectar turns to a garden of thorns and brambles.\n\nThe *Dongbin* verse:\n*Rolling waves of desire, who will board the immortal’s ferry?*\n*The Dao lies hidden, nameless—yet the body abides in the Dao.*\n*Dual principles □ the principle—this is called the True Origin.*\n\nThus, those who grasp the essentials may conclude with a single word. Those who do not know the essentials scatter endlessly.\n\nAlas! Many revere the Dao without thought, yet few encounter its truth. How lamentable that the few who err may yet be corrected, but when the many err, none can be saved. What is to be done?\n\nEven the Teaching Lord, though noble as the Son of Heaven, deeply mourned this. How much more so for the ignorant—how could they attain realization? Yet the wise and enlightened, though they may stumble, need only glimpse the Wondrous True Dao to perceive it with luminous clarity, following the path of the ranked immortals. Should one encounter it, one must strive with utmost diligence.\n\nA sojourner in the land of Great Liang, once reduced to beggary, on the *zhengyuan* day of the *wuchen* year, received from the master these scriptures in their entirety. Yet I marveled at their completeness, and in transcribing them, errors crept into the seal script. From afar, I yearn for the recovery of these texts. May the noble scholars correct and encourage, for such is the way of tireless instruction—would this not be fitting?\n\nLong ago, on the *shangyuan* day of the *jiazi* year, while engaged in purification rites at the True Origin Abbey, the August Heavenly Emperor of the Dark Mystery suddenly descended, delivering a divine pronouncement: \"The precious precepts of the Wondrous True originated with Emperor Yao and are the incarnate response of the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Virtue from the Upper Realm. They may be transmitted to the virtuous; this foolish old man has benefited greatly.\" With reverence, I bathed and recorded this, tracing its source and intent, wishing to elucidate its teachings.\n\nThose who possess incomplete or defective versions of the *Daoist Canon* shall not accept them. Thus, I have distilled its essentials, pruned its redundancies, and devoted this work to the lofty scholars of the Mysterious Dao. Upon perusal, may they advance in the Way with clarity and strive without hesitation.\n\nI have learned that the Wondrous Non-Ultimate Supreme Emperor initiated the Great Cavern’s Mysterious Truth, first bestowing the title of Jade Clarity’s Celestial Lord, Master of the Teachings of Equal Heaven, to propagate the wind of the Dao and illuminate virtue, and to chastise evil while exhorting goodness. In this latter age, disciples fortunate enough to encounter such rare treasures seek to repay their masters’ benevolence—no endeavor surpasses the expansion of the scriptural model. To cultivate one’s own perfection alone, delighting solely in the Three Caverns, how does this compare to sharing its bounty widely across the nine directions, that all may together bathe in the Mysterious Blessing? This is the sincere aspiration of my heart.\n\nDisciple of the True Origin, your servant Li Jingyuan, declares: With reverence, I have received the soaring decree of the Protector Sage. As in the time of Emperor Yao, this is the incarnate response of the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Virtue from the Upper Realm. Here lies the Wondrous True Precious Text, now reproduced in print by the reclusive scholar of Liang. After purificatory rites and offerings at the shrine, I submit this memorial, further entreating that it be distributed among booksellers, ensuring its transmission throughout the commanderies. May all, in emulation, chastise evil and exhort goodness, aligning with the Heavenly Dao.\n\nWith humble devotion, this solitary servant seeks to exhaust his sincerity, dedicating these meritorious virtues to the august sovereign emperor of the great dynasty, praying for his boundless longevity. May the crown prince enjoy countless years, and may the various princes, ministers, and aides likewise attain enduring lifespans, sharing in the fortune of eternal peace. Thus concludes the *Sequel to the Profound Source of the Dao and the Cavern of True Mystery*.",

      "translated_text": "**Profound Source of the Dao’s Mysteries: Continuation of the Cavern of True Reality**\n*Scripture Title:* *Profound Source of the Dao’s Mysteries: Continuation of the Cavern of True Reality*\nAnnotated by Li Jingyuan of the Song Dynasty\nThree scrolls\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Supreme Mystery Section\n\n**Profound Source of the Dao’s Mysteries: Continuation of the Cavern of True Reality, Scroll One**\nCompiled and annotated by Li Jingyuan, disciple of the Gate of True Origin\n\n**Question on the Meridians and Collaterals**\nMaster Liu states: How noble is the human body! The hand Shaoyang Triple Burner meridians and collaterals—with their patterns of disease, origins, progression, and treatment—are vast indeed.\n\nThe Dao’s operation through wondrous reality spans from antiquity to the present. Thus, one who speaks well of the past must find verification in the present; one who speaks well of Heaven must find confirmation in humanity. The celestial divisions of qi number twelve, to which the human meridians correspond; the degrees of the celestial circuit total three hundred and sixty-five, to which the human qi points correspond. The nine orifices, five viscera, and twelve joints of the human body—referring to the three yin and three yang of the hands and feet—all communicate with Heaven’s qi and respond to the seasons.\n\nWhen the Dipper’s handle turns, the *Tai* hexagram of the *yin* position marks the onset of the first lunar month, and the pitch standard aligns with *Taicou*. The ancient system took *zi* as the origin, but now *yin* is regarded as the beginning. Thus, the celestial Dao moves southward: its image above is the Human and Horse constellations, and below, the Swallow. Its qi concentrates in the human Triple Burner.\n\nThe Triple Burner is the official of the waterways, from which the water passages emerge. It pertains to the Bladder, the solitary *fu*. The Heart and Lungs reside together in the Upper Burner, which is like mist; the Liver and Spleen share the Middle Burner, which is like a marsh; and the Kidneys occupy the Lower Burner, which is like a drainage ditch. The Triple Burner is the thoroughfare of water and grain, the beginning and end of the spirit and qi.\n\nThe Upper Burner lies below the Heart and above the diaphragm, at the upper opening of the Stomach. It governs intake but not discharge, and its treatment point is one *cun* and six *fen* below the *Shanzhong* (Jade Hall), in the depression between the two nipples. The Middle Burner lies in the central region of the Stomach, neither above nor below, governing the decomposition of water and grain. Its treatment point is beside the navel, called *Tianshu*. The Lower Burner lies below the navel, at the upper opening of the Bladder, governing the separation of the clear and turbid, discharge but not intake, and the transmission of waste. Its treatment point is one *cun* below the navel, named *Sanjiao* (Triple Burner), and its *fu* is at *Qichong*. *Qichong* is located below the navel, at the two ends of the pubic bone, one *cun* above the groin, where the pulsation of the femoral artery responds to the hand.\n\nThe transformations of the Triple Burner’s six qi all emanate from the meridians. The well points (*jing*) are Metal: *Guanchong*, two points located at the tips of the little finger and the next finger, a leek-leaf’s width from the nail. The flowing points (*rong*) are Water: *Yemen*, two points in the depression between the little finger and the next finger. The transporting points (*shu*) are Wood: *Zhongzhu*, two points behind the proximal joint of the little finger and the next finger. The Triple Burner’s *shu* point is below the thirteenth vertebra, and its *mu* point is two *cun* below the navel, called the *Dantian*. The source points (*yuan*) are *Yangchi*, two points in the depression on the dorsal wrist. All meridians take their *shu* points as their source, located between the Kidneys below the navel. The moving qi is the life of the human being, the root of all meridians—hence it is called the *yuan* (source).\n\nThe channel points (*jing*) are Fire: *Zhigou*, two points three *cun* behind the wrist, between the two bones. At the *qian* hour of night, the human qi resides in the hand Shaoyang Triple Burner meridian; the vertical vessels are the *jing* (channels). By the *xu* hour, the human qi also lies in the Triple Burner’s collaterals; the horizontal vessels are the *luo* (collaterals). *Jia* governs the left hand’s Shaoyang, its qi in the Gallbladder, pertaining to the Middle Burner. *Yin*—the first month—governs the left foot’s Shaoyang, and the human qi on the left also resides in the Liver.\n\nThe uniting points (*he*) are Earth: *Tianjing*, two points in the depression one *cun* above the elbow, behind the outer bone. The Triple Burner is the hand Shaoyang meridian. It begins at the tip of the little finger and the next finger, ascends between the two fingers, follows the back of the hand, emerges between the two bones of the forearm, passes through the elbow, ascends along the outer arm to the shoulder, crosses behind the foot Shaoyang, enters the supraclavicular fossa, spreads through the *Shanzhong*, connects with the Pericardium, descends through the diaphragm, and pertains to the Triple Burner.\n\n**Triple Burner Disorders**\nWhen the Triple Burner is diseased, the abdomen becomes full, the lower abdomen particularly hard, urination is obstructed, and urgency leads to overflow, causing water retention.\n\nThe Upper Burner lies below the Heart and above the diaphragm, at the upper opening of the Stomach. It governs intake but not discharge, and its treatment point is one *cun* and six *fen* below *Shanzhong* (Jade Hall), in the depression between the two nipples. The Middle Burner lies in the central region of the Stomach, neither above nor below, governing the decomposition of water and grain. Its treatment point is one *cun* below the navel, named *Sanjiao*. The Lower Burner lies below the navel, at the upper opening of the Bladder, governing the separation of the clear and turbid, discharge but not intake, and the transmission of waste. Its treatment point is one *cun* below the navel, named *Sanjiao*. Its *fu* is at *Qichong*, near the *Dantian*. The Upper Burner’s *mu* point is two *cun* below the navel.\n\n**Discourse on Upper Burner Deficiency-Cold**\nThe Upper Burner is like mist. Its qi arises at the upper opening of the Stomach, ascends alongside the throat, and penetrates the diaphragm. When its qi is deficient and cold, it causes the spirit to lose its residence. Drawing qi into the Lungs, it results in coughing, loss of voice, and the onset of diaphragmatic cold disorders.\n\n**Discourse on Upper Burner Heat**\nThe Upper Burner lies below the Heart. Its qi arises at the upper opening of the Stomach, ascends alongside the throat, and penetrates the diaphragm. When heat is present, it causes dryness of the throat and tongue, foul breath, flushed face, and the onset of chest and diaphragmatic fullness and stagnation.\n\n**Discourse on Middle Burner Deficiency-Cold**\nThe Middle Burner is like a marsh, for it lies in the central region of the Stomach, neither above nor below, governing the decomposition of water and grain. The Stomach’s yang qi must be warm to decompose and transform the essence of water and grain, nourishing the entire body. If cold invades this central position, the Stomach becomes cold. When the Stomach is cold, food is not digested, leading to abdominal pain, undigested diarrhea, cholera, vomiting, and diarrhea. The treatment method should involve warming and supplementation.",

      "translated_text": "**Discourse on Middle Burner Heat**\n\nThe Middle Burner resides in the central region of the Stomach, neither above nor below, governing the decomposition and maturation of water and grain. Its qi is harmonious and gentle, smoothly transmitting the waste and steaming the fluids to transform them. The refined essence ascends to infuse the Lungs, circulating through the constructive and defensive qi. If heat lodges in the Middle Burner, it congeals into hardness, causing its qi to become replete and obstructed, failing to communicate between above and below. The diaphragm becomes severed by heat, the exterior of the body grows heavy, the eyes turn yellow, and a sweet taste lingers in the mouth—thus arise the signs of spleen obstruction.\n\n**Discourse on Lower Burner Deficiency-Cold**\n\nThe Lower Burner is like a drainage ditch. Its qi arises from the lower region of the Stomach, diverging at the turning intestine and pouring into the Bladder. It governs outward movement without inward retention, serving as the pathway of transmission. If its qi is deficient and cold, the fluids are not secured, leading to incessant diarrhea of both stool and urine, lower abdominal pain, and aversion to hearing human speech. Should all Three Burners be deficient: Upper Burner deficiency draws qi into the Lungs; Middle Burner deficiency generates cold, giving rise to abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, incessant bowel movements, and cholera; Lower Burner deficiency results in unceasing stool and urine, the severance of fluids and qi, and cold—thus supplementation should target the Kidneys. Now, the Three Burners are the pathways of water and grain, the beginning and end of qi. Though their locations differ, their principle is one, hence the existence of diseases where all are deficient. The treatment should involve warming.\n\n**Discourse on Lower Burner Heat**\n\nThe Lower Burner lies below the navel, at the upper opening of the Bladder, governing the separation of the clear and turbid. It moves outward without inward retention, serving as the pathway of transmission. Moreover, the Lower Burner is like a drainage ditch, managing the dredging and discharge of qi. If it is replete and harbors heat, the fluids within desiccate, and transmission becomes impeded—thus arise signs of qi counterflow, difficult defecation, abdominal distension, and retching. The treatment method should involve draining and guiding the qi of the Three Burners.\n\n**Comprehensive Discourse on the Three Burners**\n\nThe Three Burners have a name but no form, presiding over all qi to emulate the functions of the Three Powers. Thus, the ascent and descent of breath, the coming and going of water and grain, all depend on this for free passage. Therefore, the Upper Burner lies below the Heart, governing inward retention without outward discharge; the Middle Burner lies in the Stomach region, governing the decomposition and maturation of water and grain; the Lower Burner lies below the navel, governing the separation of the clear and turbid, moving outward without inward retention. In comprehensive discussion, the Three Burners correspond above to the Lesser Yang, emerging at Guanchong. Guanchong is located at the tip of the ring finger on the hand, belonging to the Hand Lesser Yang channel, a network vessel of the Greater Yang. When the qi of the Three Burners is exuberant and in excess, distension and fullness fill the space within the skin, feeling light yet unsubstantial. Alternatively, the urine may be clear while defecation is difficult. Difficult defecation arises from disharmony among the Five Viscera, where yin and yang are unevenly deficient or replete—this is called disharmony of the Three Burners, where cold and heat congeal together. This is the repletion of the Three Burners, and the appropriate method is to guide and drain their qi. If the qi of the Three Burners is insufficient, cold qi invades, causing enuresis, diarrhea, qi fullness, or undigested food—this is the deficiency of the Three Burners’ qi. The appropriate method is to warm Laogong and Guanyuan, embracing unity and securing the Origin, while closing the mouth, curling the tongue, and swallowing the fetal fluids. Laogong, a Fire point, lies below the pulsation in the center of the palm; it is located by bending the ring finger to find it. Guanyuan, the alarm point of the Small Intestine, lies three body-inches below the navel, at the convergence of the Foot Three Yin and the Conception Vessel.\n\nHeaven possesses great beauty yet does not speak; the four seasons have bright laws yet do not debate; the myriad things have completed principles yet do not explain. Thus, Heaven does not speak, yet the four seasons proceed and the hundred things are born. Only the sage traces the beauty of Heaven and Earth, penetrating the principles of the myriad things. In regulation, spring is warm, summer is hot, autumn is sharp, winter is stern—the four seasons alternate in succession without uniformity. When yang is in operation, the myriad things flourish; at such times, people seek and follow. When yin is in operation, the myriad things congeal; at such times, people become tranquil and sigh. Moreover, the six transformations govern the five flavors, the generation of the five colors, and the suitability for the Five Viscera—all are tied to the waxing and waning of growth and decline.\n\nIn each year, the months of *yin*, *mao*, and *chen* constitute springtime. Spring qi moves westward, residing in the channels and vessels—thus, in spring, the pulse is taut like a hook, which is the norm. If it does not follow the norm but deviates, it is pathological. Spring qi begins below and to the left. It is also said that spring qi begins in the front; thus, in the first and second months, spring qi resides in the Liver. The Liver governs in spring and flourishes in *jia* and *yi*, with its transport point in the neck and nape. The Liver is the organ of the general, whence plans and deliberations emerge; it is the abode of the ethereal soul. The Liver is the master of generation, the Lesser Yang, the beginning of yang’s growth. In the first, second, and third months, human qi resides on the left. To nourish yang in spring, one should consume cooling foods to cultivate yang. The Liver detests wind and also fears clarity—clarity is the command of Metal. If spring is injured by wind, summer will bring watery diarrhea. Thus, spring diseases reside in the Liver, the head, and the transport points, as well as in its yin aspect. Moreover, spring diseases begin in the front. Those skilled in nurturing life regulate their spirit in accordance with spring qi: retiring late and rising early, strolling broadly in the courtyard, loosening the hair and relaxing the body to enliven the will—this is the Way of nurturing life in response to spring qi. Spring should be cool to govern the Liver, but if it is warm instead, one should distance oneself from warmth, for following this preserves the spirit, while opposing it injures the Liver.\n\nIn the month when the Dipper’s handle points due east, the second month of spring, *mao* is in the phase of *Great Strength*. The pitch standard is *Zhonglü*, the celestial path moves southwest, its image above is the Celestial Scorpion Palace, below is Song. Its qi resides in the human Large Intestine. The Large Intestine is the organ of transmission, whence transformations emerge. The method of transformation: the Metal well point of the Hand Yangming Large Intestine channel is Shangyang, two points located on the inner side of the index finger, a leek-leaf’s width from the corner of the nail; the Wood spring point is Erjian, two points in the depression on the inner side of the index finger’s proximal joint; the Wood transport point is Sanjian, two points in the depression on the inner side of the index finger’s distal joint; the Large Intestine transport point is below the sixteenth vertebra, on either side; the source point is Hegu, two points in the depression between the thumb and index finger, also called the Tiger’s Mouth.",

      "translated_text": "The Fire channel point is Yangxi, two points located in the depression between the two tendons on the upper side of the wrist. At the hour of *jia* (5–7 a.m.) each day, the human qi resides here. The Hand Yangming Large Intestine channel, by the hour of *mao* (5–7 a.m.), also has the human qi in the Large Intestine network. *Geng* governs the right hand’s Lesser Yin, and its qi governs illnesses of the Large Intestine. *Mao* serves as the weft; the second month governs the left foot’s Greater Yang, and by this time, the human qi on the left also resides in the liver.\n\nThe Earth convergence point is Quchi, two points located in the depression at the posterior border of the elbow’s auxiliary bone when the elbow is flexed. The Large Intestine is not unlike the lung in this regard. The Large Intestine Hand Yangming channel begins at the tip of the index finger, ascends along the finger’s edge, emerges between the two bones at Hegu, enters the space between the two tendons, follows the upper border of the forearm, enters the outer side of the elbow, ascends along the outer border of the upper arm, emerges at the anterior border of the shoulder, passes above the meeting point of the clavicle, descends into the supraclavicular fossa to connect with the lung, passes through the diaphragm, and pertains to the Large Intestine.\n\nIn Large Intestine disease, there is acute pain in the intestines with gurgling sounds. When cold is contracted again in winter, diarrhea occurs with pain below the navel, and one cannot stand for long—this is the same as stomach symptoms. The *Classic* states: \"After eating to satiety, the sinews and channels become slack, and intestinal displacement leads to hemorrhoids. This is because excessive eating injures the intestines and stomach.\" The symptoms of Large Intestine disease: the Large Intestine corresponds to Metal and governs autumn; the Hand Yangming is its channel. It is the organ of the lung and serves as the official of transmission, whence the transformation of waste emerges.\n\nWhen its qi is exuberant, it becomes excessive, causing acute pain within the intestines as if pierced by an awl or knife without respite, accompanied by cold impediment and spasms in the lower back and spine at rest—this is the repletion of Large Intestine qi, and purging is appropriate. When Large Intestine qi is insufficient, cold qi invades, leading to frequent diarrhea—this is the vacuity of Large Intestine qi, and supplementation is appropriate.\n\nWhen examining the pulse at the *cunkou* of the right hand, it pertains to the Hand Yangming channel. A floating pulse indicates Yang; if the Yang is replete, the Large Intestine is replete. The diseases of Large Intestine vacuity and cold include panting in the chest, intestinal rumbling, vacuous thirst, dry lips, tense eyes, susceptibility to fright, sloppy diarrhea, pain in the joints, and inability to stand for long. When cold evil lodges within, the qi becomes vacuous and weak, unable to secure itself, giving rise to various illnesses. When examining the pulse, if the Yang is vacuous before the *qikou* of the right hand, this is the condition.\n\nIn Large Intestine repletion, the Large Intestine is the organ of transmission and drainage. When its qi is exuberant and replete, dryness and heat arise. If transmission and drainage are impeded, there is pain in the intestines as if pierced by an awl or knife, or mouse-like growths form, with swelling, distension, pain, and oppression. When the Large Intestine is obstructed, there is abdominal and rib-side distension and fullness, heaviness and pain in the lower back and spine, and panting with fullness above—all signs of Large Intestine qi repletion. The disease primarily involves heat consuming fluids, causing constipation. If there is only blockage without defecation, these are the symptoms.\n\nThus, the Perfected One’s dietary regimen includes walking a hundred paces after eating and repeatedly massaging the abdomen to prevent the onset of severe illnesses. For those in old age, around eighty, with constipation due to scant fluids, cold medicinals should not be used to induce purgation, as recorded in the *Materia Medica*. Use one *jin* of tangerine peel and six *liang* of apricot kernels, forming honey pills called \"Qi-Descending Pills.\" These not only descend qi but also moisten the Large Intestine, enabling eating without damaging qi. When entering the Large Intestine, their supplementation and purgation are regulated, and their treatment aligns with that of the lung viscus.\n\nThe Celestial Stem *tian gang* follows the establishment of the third month of spring. The *gua* of *chen* is *guai*, and its pitch corresponds to *Guxi*. The celestial Dao moves northward; its image above is the celestial palace *gong*, and below is *Zheng*. Its qi resides in the human Small Intestine. The Small Intestine is the official of reception and transformation, whence the transformation of substances emerges.\n\nThe method of transformation: the Metal well point of the Hand Taiyang Small Intestine channel is Shaoze, two points located at the tip of the little finger, one *fen* from the lower edge of the nail. The Wood spring point is Qiangu, two points in the depression anterior to the little finger’s proximal joint on the outer side. The Wood transport point is Houxi, two points in the depression posterior to the little finger’s proximal joint on the outer side. The Small Intestine transport point is below the eighteenth vertebra on either side. Guanyuan is one point located three *cun* below the navel, the gathering point of the Small Intestine, where the Foot Taiyin, Shaoyin, Jueyin, and Ren channels meet—the lower regulator is Guanyuan. The source point is at Wangu, two points in the depression below the prominent bone on the anterior side of the wrist’s outer edge.\n\nThe Fire channel point is Yanggu, two points in the depression below the prominent bone on the outer side of the wrist. At the hour of *ding* (9–11 a.m.) each day, the human qi resides here. The Hand Taiyang Small Intestine channel, by the hour of *wei* (1–3 p.m.), also has the human qi in the Small Intestine network. *Bing* governs the left hand’s Yangming, and its qi governs illnesses of the Small Intestine. *Chen* is the third month, governing the left foot’s Yangming, and by this time, the human qi on the left also resides in the spleen.\n\nThe Earth convergence point is Shaohai, two points in the depression posterior to the inner side of the elbow’s auxiliary bone. Thus, the Small Intestine and heart are exterior-interior pairs. The Small Intestine Hand Taiyang channel begins at the tip of the little finger, ascends along the outer side of the hand to the wrist, emerges at the styloid process, ascends straight along the ulna, exits the inner side of the elbow between the two tendons, follows the outer posterior border of the upper arm, emerges at the shoulder joint, encircles the scapula, intersects above the shoulder, enters the supraclavicular fossa to connect with the heart, descends along the throat, passes through the diaphragm to reach the stomach, and pertains to the Small Intestine.\n\nIn Small Intestine disease, there is pain in the Small Intestine, with the lower back and spine feeling as if pulled by a bowstring, and pain extending to the anus. There is scorching heat in front of the ears, and severe cold aversion. If only the shoulder is extremely hot, or the area between the little finger and ring finger is hot, or the pulse is sunken, these are the symptoms. *Ze* is pronounced as *gaoyin*; the symptoms of Small Intestine disease: the Small Intestine corresponds to Fire and governs summer; the Hand Taiyang is its channel. It is the organ of the heart. The downward movement of water and fluids becomes urine, which flows into the Small Intestine.\n\nWhen its qi is exuberant, it becomes excessive, causing Small Intestine disease with heat, scorching, dryness, and roughness. If the Small Intestine is distended, this is the repletion of Small Intestine qi.",

      "translated_text": "Then it is appropriate to purge it. When the Small Intestine is deficient, cold qi invades it. In cases of Small Intestine disease, there may be fright, jumping, and inability to speak, with symptoms appearing and disappearing suddenly—these are signs of Small Intestine qi deficiency. In such cases, it is appropriate to tonify.\n\nThe *Treatise on Small Intestine Deficiency* states: The Small Intestine is the official of reception and transformation, the palace of the heart. The Hand Taiyang is its channel. When its qi is deficient, it becomes insufficient. Thus, if the pulse at the *cunkou* of the left hand, before the *renying*, is yang-deficient, this indicates Small Intestine deficiency. Deficiency generates cold, giving rise to symptoms such as unilateral pain at the forehead and temples, deafness, fright, and frequent urination. The treatment should focus on tonification.\n\nThe *Treatise on Small Intestine Repletion* states: The Small Intestine is the official of reception and transformation, the palace of the heart. The Hand Taiyang is its channel. When its qi is exuberant, it becomes excessive. Thus, if the pulse at the *cunkou* of the left hand, before the *renying*, is yang-replete, this indicates Small Intestine repletion. Repletion generates heat, giving rise to symptoms such as alternating fever, mouth sores, heart vexation, heavy body with no sweating, and inhibited urination. Treatment should employ the methods of supplementation and drainage, aligning with the heart’s organ without deviation.\n\nNext in sequence is the establishment of the early summer month, corresponding to the *si* (巳) hexagram of *Qian* (乾), with the pitch tuned to *Zhonglü*. The *Qian* Dao moves westward; its celestial symbol is the Double Maiden Palace, and its terrestrial counterpart is Chu. Its qi in humans pertains to the Hand Jueyin Pericardium channel. The well (metal) point is *Zhongchong*, located at the tip of the middle finger, one leaf of a leek’s width from the nail. The spring (wood) point is *Laogong*, situated at the center of the palm, found by flexing the ring finger. The stream (wood) point is *Daling*, located in the depression between the two tendons on the back of the wrist. The river (fire) point is *Jianshi*, found in the depression between the two tendons three *cun* proximal to the wrist.\n\nAt the *xin* hour, human qi resides in the Hand Jueyin Pericardium channel. By the *xu* hour, human qi also dwells in the Pericardium network. The *si* (巳) month governs the right foot’s Yangming channel, and when human qi is on the right, it also pertains to the spleen. The uniting (earth) point is *Quze*, located in the depression below the inner elbow crease, found by flexing the elbow. Alternatively, *Danzhong* is the official of the minister, from which joy and happiness arise. *Danzhong* lies between the two breasts in the chest, serving as the sea of qi. The Pericardium, as the ruler’s envoy, disseminates commands through the vessels. *Shanzhong* governs qi, distributing it between yin and yang. When qi harmonizes and the will is at ease, joy and happiness arise. Its transport point above is located above and below the *zhugu* (vertebra prominens), anterior to the *renying*. *Danzhong* is also described as the palace city of the Pericardium. Another reference places *Danzhong* as a single point in the depression between the two breasts, accessed while lying supine—this is where the Ren Mai’s qi emanates. The ancient immortals said: \"To ensure bodily peace, simmer the broth in the central hall.\"\n\nFollowing the sequence, the *si*, *wu*, and *wei* months still belong to summer. In summer, celestial qi moves northward, giving rise to rainbows, clouds, mist, wind, and rain across the four seasons—these are the accumulations of qi forming in heaven. Mountains, rivers, seas, metals, stones, fire, and wood are the accumulations of form taking shape on earth. Earth bears the forms of all living things, while the void arranges the essence-qi of heaven. The movement of form and essence is like the relationship between roots and branches. The ignorant merely see accumulated qi shining above, accumulated forms positioned below, and the yearly movements residing in between, yet fail to grasp the principle of the three as one.\n\nThe qi of the Five Phases correspond above to the five stars and internally penetrate the five viscera. It is said of the *Palace of Medicinals* and the *Flowery Terrace of Cloud Scripts*, as well as the profound discourses of the *Cavern Manuscripts*: The virtue of water corresponds to the Chen star, the virtue of wood to Jupiter, the virtue of fire to Mars, the virtue of earth to Saturn, and the virtue of metal to Venus. In humans, these correspond to the kidneys, liver, heart, spleen, and lungs.\n\nThus, summer qi begins in the center and extends forward, or is also said to begin from behind. Summer qi resides in the *sunluo* (grandchild network vessels). The main channels are likened to the trunk and branches, while the transverse vessels are the networks; the networks beyond these are the *sunluo*. The summer pulse is surging and large—this is its normal state. If it deviates from this norm, it indicates disease.\n\nFrom the fourth month of summer onward, human qi is on the right and pertains to the spleen. In the fifth and sixth months, qi similarly resides on the right and pertains to the head. From mid-summer, illnesses often manifest in the chest and flanks. The sixth month is known as *long summer*, with qi residing in the muscles and flesh. In *long summer*, illnesses often present as cold diarrhea. In mid-summer, diseases affect the yang and the heart and viscera.\n\nSummer takes the stomach qi as its foundation, and *long summer* also takes the stomach qi as its foundation. The transport points lie in the chest and flanks. In summer, the heart governs the qi of the human body. During the heat of summer, the heart is treated with coolness, yet paradoxically, heat arises. Generally, in summer, one should nourish yang by consuming cooling foods. However, while spring and summer diets favor cold and cool foods, the guiding principle of moderation—neither too warm nor too cold—remains the safest approach. This is the optimal way.\n\nSummer’s heat resides in the heart. Heat injures the form, so the heart dislikes heat and fears cold. Cold is the mandate of water, and thus using heat at the right time can keep heat at bay. Medicinals and food should follow the same principle. Therefore, the wise avoid compounding heat with heat. If one does not keep heat at a distance, heat will arrive. When heat arrives, it causes fever, vomiting, diarrhea, cholera, abscesses, sores, mental confusion, depression, diarrhea with urgency, spasms, swelling, distension, vomiting, nosebleeds, headaches, bone and joint pain, muscle soreness, blood overflow, blood in the stool, and urinary strangury.\n\nIt is said that when the heart spirit is in excess, yet the pulse and qi are also excessive while the form and qi are insufficient, the person may still live. Generally, when a person externally exhibits five signs of excess: (1) the body is hot as charcoal, (2) the neck and chest feel obstructed, (3) the *renying* pulse is agitated and exuberant, (4) there is panting, and (5) qi counterflow—if the body shows neither external nor internal signs, death is certain.\n\nWhen a person is injured by summerheat in summer, it transforms into malarial fever in autumn. Only the sage is not thus afflicted, for they can transmit their spirit, harmonize with celestial qi, and communicate with the divine luminaries.",
      "overlap_context": " *Ze* is pronounced as *gaoyin*; the symptoms of Small Intestine disease: the Small Intestine corresponds to Fire and governs summer; the Hand Taiyang is its channel. It is the organ of the heart. The downward movement of water and fluids becomes urine, which flows into the Small Intestine.\n\nWhen its qi is exuberant, it becomes excessive, causing Small Intestine disease with heat, scorching, dryness, and roughness. If the Small Intestine is distended, this is the repletion of Small Intestine qi.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, tranquility is attained. If one suffers from illness, there exists the Dao of regulating the spirit in accordance with summer qi. This entails retiring late and rising early, never tiring of the sun, ensuring the mind remains free from anger, and allowing qi to flow freely. Such is the Dao of nurturing growth in response to summer qi. To contravene this injures the heart.\n\nWhen the Dipper’s handle points due south in the mid-summer month, it aligns with the *Gou* hexagram of the noon position, and the pitch corresponds to *Ruibin*. Noon marks the meridian, where the *Initial Six* yin begins to stir. The celestial Dao moves northwest, its image above in the constellation of the Lion, below in the Zhou region. Human qi resides in the heart, which governs the five viscera.\n\nThe heart is the zang-organ, the small intestine its paired fu-organ. Its nature is summerheat, which harms the form. Its note is *zhi*, its image *Li*. Fire reigns in summer, is cut off in winter, and perishes under the *ren* and *gui* stems. Thus, the human heart-mind responds to the eight winds:\n\nWhen wind comes from the east, it is called *Infant Wind*. It injures the outer sinews and twists, lodging internally in the liver.\nWhen wind comes from the southeast, it is called *Weak Wind*. It injures the outer flesh, lodging internally in the stomach.\nWhen wind comes from the south, it is called *Great Weak Wind*. It injures the outer vessels, lodging internally in the heart.\nWhen wind comes from the southwest, it is called *Plotting Wind*. It injures the outer muscles, lodging internally in the spleen.\nWhen wind comes from the west, it is called *Sturdy Wind*. It injures the outer skin, lodging internally in the lungs.\nWhen wind comes from the northwest, it is called *Breaking Wind*. It injures the *Taiyang* vessels of the hand, connecting internally to the small intestine.\nWhen wind comes from the north, it is called *Great Sturdy Wind*. It injures the outer bones, lodging internally in the kidneys.\nWhen wind comes from the northeast, it is called *Ominous Wind*. It injures the outer flanks and ribs, lodging internally in the large intestine.\n\nThus, the human heart-mind responds to the eight winds. For the qi of life communicates with Heaven—no small matter indeed.\n\nThe heart stores the spirit, which delights in serenity and emptiness. The heart is the sovereign official, the yang father. The external aspect of the heart is yang. As the root of life and the transformation of spirit, the heart is where the numinous luminosity emerges. Its luster manifests in the complexion, its fullness in the blood vessels. The vessels are the mansion of blood, where all blood converges under the heart’s governance.\n\nProlonged gazing injures the blood, for it wearies the heart. When the heart is wearied, one becomes absent-minded, forgetful, and suffers from difficult bowel movements—sometimes loose like duck droppings—or mouth sores. Grief, sorrow, and excessive contemplation injure the heart, leading to fright, forgetfulness, and erratic joy or anger.\n\nThe heart is yang qi, the supreme yang within yang. Yang diseases arise in the blood. The heart nourishes blood, and thus the vessels are the foundation of the five viscera. The heart governs the vessels, which course through the arms and hands. The heart opens into the ears, the anterior and posterior yin orifices. When essence and qi converge in the heart, joy arises. Thus, sudden joy injures the yang, the heart, and qi.\n\nThe heart’s fluid is sweat. The heart qi governs the tongue, its condition reflected there. Only when heart qi is harmonious does it communicate with the tongue. When the heart is at peace, the tongue discerns the five flavors. Its odor is scorched. A supple tongue indicates vitality; roughness, stiffness, or contraction foretell death.\n\nThe heart desires bitter flavors, which enter it first. Excessive bitter flavors cause the skin to wither and the hair to fall out. The heart desires softness; to soften it, consume salty foods promptly. The heart suffers from slackness; to restrain it, consume sour foods promptly. The heart loathes heat and fears cold, for cold is the mandate of water.\n\nExcessive bitter flavors fail to moisten the spleen qi, thickening the stomach qi—this is a forbidden flavor. Salt travels to the blood; in blood diseases, avoid excessive salt. The heart’s prohibitions are warm clothing and hot food.\n\nThus, the sage approaches sounds, colors, and flavors: what benefits nature is embraced, what harms it is discarded. When food and drink enter the stomach, they nourish the heart zang. When the heart flourishes, the complexion mirrors the sun. Thus, in heart heat, the forehead reddens first.\n\nIt is said that heart heat manifests as redness with overflowing vessels. If the complexion is predominantly green, there is pain; if black, numbness; if yellow-red, heat; if white, cold. When all five colors appear, there is both cold and heat. Though red and yellow signify heat, green, white, and black portend misfortune—how can one remain ignorant?\n\nThe southern direction is ruled by red qi, which fills the body with resonant sound, like wind and thunder. In humans, the heart stores sound, manifesting as laughter and mirth. Such is the heart at peace. If the heart is not at peace, the voice alters, and illness arises as hiccups, belching, or sorrow.\n\nAs the sovereign, the father, and the master of the five qi, the heart governs qi, vessels, sound, and color. The heart zang transforms in myriad ways: generation is called *transformation*; extremity, *change*.\n\nThe *Hand Shaoyin* is the heart’s meridian. Its *Jing-Well* point is *Shaochong*, two points located on the inner corner of the little finger, a leek-leaf’s width from the nail. Its *Ying-Spring* point is *Shaofu*, two points in the depression behind the little finger’s proximal joint. Its *Shu-Stream* point is *Shenmen*, two points at the ulnar end of the wrist crease; if the pulse here is imperceptible, death is untreatable.\n\nThe heart’s *Back-Shu* point lies below the fifth vertebra, bilateral to the spine, one and a half body-inches apart—the meeting of *Taiyang*. The heart’s *Yuan-Source* point emerges at *Daling*, flowing into the pericardium meridian. Its *Jing-River* point is *Lingdao*, two points one and a half inches (or one inch) proximal to the wrist crease.\n\nAt the *bing* hour of midday, human qi resides in the *Hand Shaoyin*, the heart’s meridian. At the *wu* hour, qi also dwells in the heart’s network vessels.",

      "translated_text": "The *ding* stem governs the *Yangming* of the right hand, and its qi also governs the heart’s visceral diseases. The *wu* branch is the meridian; in the fifth month, it governs the *Taiyang* of the right foot, while human qi also resides on the right, dwelling in the head. The *Water* confluence is *Shaohai*, two points in the depression behind the inner elbow joint.\n\nThe *Hand Shaoyin*, the heart’s meridian, arises within the heart and emerges to connect with the heart’s system. It descends through the diaphragm to network with the small intestine. The heart’s balanced pulse is normally surging and large; if sunken, it is a predatory pulse, and reversal disorders arise.\n\nWhen summer heat invades the heart, the heart stores the qi of blood and vessels. If pathogenic qi lodges in the heart, illness follows: heart pain, melancholy, frequent dizziness, and fainting. Its diseases affect the vessels’ qi and the five viscera.\n\nThus, when the heart is diseased: pain in the chest, fullness in the flanks, pain beneath the flanks, pain in the breast, back, shoulders, and scapulae, and pain along the inner arms—these are the signs of heart disease. The heart corresponds to Fire. It flourishes in summer; its pulse is hooking and surging, its diagnostic sign is the tongue, its sound is speech, its odor is scorched, its flavor is bitter, its fluid is sweat, it nourishes blood, its color is red, and it stores the spirit. The *Hand Shaoyin* is its meridian. It pairs with the small intestine, which is the *Fu* governing the exterior, while the heart is the *Zang* governing the interior.\n\nWhen heart qi is abundant, it becomes spirit; if excessive, it causes illness. Pain within the chest, fullness in the flanks, pain beneath the flanks, pain in the breast, back, shoulders, scapulae, and between the arms, and incessant laughter—these are signs of heart qi excess. Excess generates heat; heat causes yang qi to flourish, and when yang qi flourishes, the qi of *ying* and *wei* cannot circulate. The heart spirit becomes restless, the face flushes, the body grows hot, sores appear in the mouth and on the tongue, the throat dries, the head aches. If heat is severe, the sinews wither, bones dissolve, flesh melts, the skin cracks, and hair stands on end and decays.\n\nSome say: when yang qi is excessive and yin qi insufficient, there is heat in the center. One is prone to hunger. When heart qi is insufficient, the chest expands, the flanks and lower back pull taut with pain, there is fright, palpitations, absentmindedness, pallor, stiffness at the root of the tongue, and frequent sorrow—these are signs of heart qi deficiency.\n\nA general discussion of the heart: The heart pairs with the small intestine, so the *Hand Shaoyin* meridian and the *Hand Taiyang* meridian form an exterior-interior relationship. It corresponds to Fire, flourishes in summer, its pulse is surging, it governs the spirit among the viscera, joy among the emotions, sorrow in its pathological movements, and sweat among the fluids. Thus, when heart qi is deficient, sorrow is unceasing; when excessive, laughter is unending. When heart qi is deficient, one dreams of rescuing from fire; when yang things prevail, one dreams of burning. When heart qi is abundant, one dreams of joy, laughter, fear, and reversal. When qi invades the heart, one dreams of mountains and flames. When the heart declines, one becomes forgetful. When the heart is hot, one sweats excessively.\n\nIn heart heat disease, one first feels dispirited for several days before heat arises. When heat contends, there is sudden heart pain, vexation, oppression, frequent retching, redness of the face, and absence of sweat. When qi rebels, there is reversal—a sudden decline or severance of yin and yang qi, disrupting their normal order. If yin qi declines and severs below, it becomes heat reversal. If yang qi declines and severs below, it becomes cold reversal.\n\nDeficiency generates cold: one feels dispirited, sorrowful, or endlessly grieving, experiences sudden pain in the heart and abdomen, spits clear saliva, is forgetful, and easily startled. If cold is severe, the sinews contract, the bones ache, and there is congealing and weeping. Some say: when heart spirit is insufficient and vessel qi deficient, yet form and qi are excessive, death follows. Or when yang qi is insufficient and yin qi excessive, there is cold in the center, borborygmi, and abdominal pain. If both yin and yang are excessive or both insufficient, there is both cold and heat.\n\nThus, all pain, itching, and sores belong to the heart. All heat, clouded vision, and convulsions belong to Fire. All lockjaw, chattering teeth, and loss of spirit as if bereft belong to Fire. All counterflow rushing upward belongs to Fire. All restlessness, mania, and transgression belong to Fire. All swelling, pain, soreness, fright, and alarm belong to Fire. All distension and abdominal enlargement belong to heat. All diseases with sounds like drumming belong to heat. All twisting, contortion, and turbid fluids belong to heat. All vomiting, sourness, sudden diarrhea, and urgent descent belong to heat. Thus, when heat prevails, swelling and binding occur. Yang causes swelling in the four limbs, for the four limbs are the root of all yang.\n\nIn all people, warmth and heat are treated by sweating. If sores are treated with heat, wind arises. Thus, heart wind causes redness of the mouth and peeling skin. When *bing* and *ding* days in summer are injured by wind, it is heart wind. The signs of heart wind: excessive sweating, aversion to wind, scorched dryness, frequent anger, and a red complexion. In severe cases, speech becomes incoherent. The diagnosis lies in the mouth, and its color is red. Only those who follow the Dao remain unheated. If the heart is occasionally deficient, sour flavors in medicines and foods should be used to supplement it. If excessive, sweet flavors should be used to drain it. Specialized methods for regulating qi should employ exhalation to treat it, but once the disease is cured, one must not overdo it.\n\nMoreover, in the late summer month, the *Dun* hexagram of *Wei* governs, and the pitch corresponds to *Linzhong*. Human qi responds to sound, and human yin and yang qi harmonize with the pitch. The celestial Dao moves eastward; its image above is the constellation Cancer, and below it is Qin. Its qi resides in the human lung.\n\nThe lung is the *Zang*, the large intestine the *Fu*. It corresponds to Metal, its nature is cool and clear, its note is *shang*. It flourishes in autumn, is severed in summer, dies on *bing* and *ding* days, and is nourished in the skin and hair. The lung values emptiness and tranquility, governs the source of harmonious qi, and is the chief of all viscera. It is the canopy of the heart and the yin mother of the body. It is also the *Shaoyin* within yin, the first of the yin viscera, and the ministerial official from which governance and regulation emerge. Thus, the lung is the root of qi and the dwelling of the *po*. It alone circulates *ying* and *wei*; *ying* circulates within the vessels as blood.",

The heart’s *Yuan-Source* point emerges at *Daling*, flowing into the pericardium meridian.

      "translated_text": "The *wei* circulates outside the vessels, as it is the external qi. Its flourishing appears in the hair, and its fullness resides in the skin. This means the human vessels and skin correspond to the heavens as the \"skin,\" covering the hundred bones and nurturing the five *Zang*. Since qi and skin/hair are thus connected, they are easily injured by wind evil. When wind evil harms the *Fu* and *Zang*, blood and qi become deficient and weak. Moreover, after excessive labor and profuse sweating, or following severe purgation that depletes the body fluids, the fluids become exhausted and cut off, causing lung qi to congest and fail to disseminate and regulate the qi of all *Zang*, thereby giving rise to lung atrophy. Its symptoms include coughing with spittle and vomiting, counterflow of drool and foam, and frequent urination. Yet prolonged lying down injures the qi, straining the lung. When the lung is strained, one becomes short of breath and the face swells, unable to smell fragrance or stench.\n\nIt is also said that exposure to cold, or cold food and drink, injures the lung—thus, cold exposure and cold drinks harm the lung. When the lung is injured, one becomes short of breath, coughs, and the nose whistles. The lung opens at the nose, and its fluid is nasal mucus. The mouth and nose are the gateways of qi. When harmonious qi flows freely, the nose and lung are in harmony, enabling the nose to distinguish fragrance and stench. Its odor is rank, hence it is assessed through the nose. The lung desires acrid flavors, for acridity first enters the lung, but those with qi disorders should not consume much acrid food. If acrid flavors are overindulged, the sinews and vessels become slack, and the spirit weakens. Thus, excessive acridity causes sinew tension and withered nails.\n\nThe lung desires gathering; to gather it, consume sour flavors promptly. The lung desires dispersion; to disperse it, consume acrid flavors promptly. The lung suffers from counterflow of qi upward; to drain it, consume bitter flavors promptly. The lung detests cold, for cold is yin qi. Not only does it detest cold, but it also fears heat, for heat is the fire mandate. Joy injures the lung qi. When the spirit converges in the lung, sorrow also causes harm. The lung prohibits cold food, cold drink, and cold clothing. Furthermore, excessive drinking causes qi counterflow—if one drinks too much, the lung’s lobes lift, and qi counterflows upward in a rush.\n\nAll drinking and sexual activity must strictly avoid drafts. As Yaofu said, \"Pure joy is rare; even a slight deficiency should not be indulged. After three days of heavy drinking, never exceed five parts.\" Wang Lao said, \"When food and drink encroach upon the lung, phlegm and water surge upward, qi congests and fails to move, and the face breaks out in sores.\" It is said that when the lung is congested, the large intestine becomes obstructed. Thus, lung qi values cool clarity, and those with white complexions correspond to the lung.\n\nThe lung governs sound, and sound manifests as weeping. Its pathological movement is coughing. The Hand Greater Yin Lung Channel: the well point is Metal, *Shaoshang*, located two points on the inner tip of the thumb, a leek-leaf’s width from the corner of the nail. The spring point is Water, *Yuji*, two points on the inner side behind the thumb’s base joint, in the scattered vessels. The stream point is the root, *Taiyuan*, two points in the depression behind the palm; if the pulse is cut off here, death is untreatable.\n\nIt is said that the lung *shu* point is below the third vertebra on both sides, extending to the shoulders and back. The lung’s source point emerges at *Taiyuan*. The channel point is Fire, *Jingqu*, two points in the inch pulse. At the *gen* hour, human qi resides in the Hand Greater Yin Lung Channel, and at the *yin* hour, it also resides in the lung’s network vessels. *Xin* governs the right hand’s Greater Yin and also the lung *Zang*’s illnesses. *Wei* governs the sixth month, the right foot’s Lesser Yang, and human qi in the right side and head.\n\nThe uniting point is Earth, *Chize*, two points in the elbow crease. The lung’s vessel is *Tianfu*, located three body-inches above the inner side of the elbow’s posterior, below the armpit, where the moving pulse responds to the hand—this is the lung’s qi. The Hand Greater Yin Lung Channel begins in the middle burner, descends to connect with the large intestine, circles back along the stomach’s opening, ascends through the diaphragm to belong to the lung. From the lung system, it emerges horizontally from the armpit, follows the inner arm, running alongside the Lesser Yin Heart Governor. It descends anteriorly through the elbow, follows the inner upper bone of the arm, descends to the forearm, enters the inch opening, ascends to the fish border, and emerges at the thumb’s tip.\n\nThus, the lung pulse is floating and short—this is its norm. If the thief pulse is surging and large, severe illness arises. Therefore, the lung is the root source of qi. If qi and blood are disharmonious, the hundred diseases transform and arise. Qi and blood prefer warmth and detest cold, like snow in water, congealing and failing to disperse. The lung’s qi is cool and clear; the lung circulates *ying* and *wei*, and *ying* is the blood within yin and yang.\n\nIt is said that when essence and qi converge in the lung, sorrow arises. It is also said that joy and anger injure the qi. If evil qi resides in the lung, coughing moves the shoulders and back. In lung disease, one pants, coughs, and qi counterflows; the shoulders, back, and lower back ache; sweat appears; and the yin regions, thighs, knees, calves, shins, and feet all ache. In lung disease diagnosis, the lung corresponds to Metal, flourishes in autumn, and its pulse is like floating hair.\n\nThe lung is assessed through the nose, its sound is weeping, its odor is rank, its flavor is acrid, its fluid is nasal mucus, it nourishes the skin and hair, it stores qi, its color is white, its spirit is the *po*, and its channel is the Hand Greater Yin Lung, which pairs with the large intestine. The large intestine is the *Fu*, governing the exterior of the lung, while the lung is the *Zang* governing the interior.\n\nWhen lung qi is excessive, qi is in surplus and causes illness: panting, coughing, counterflow qi, shoulder and back pain, sweating, lower back and yin region pain, and pain in the abdomen, knees, calves, shins, and feet—this is lung qi repletion, and thus it should be drained. When lung qi is insufficient, one is short of breath and unable to catch the breath, the ears deafen, and the throat dries—this is lung qi deficiency, and thus it should be supplemented.\n\n**General Discussion of the Lung *Zang*:** Among the five *Zang*’s positions, the lung alone resides above. Thus, heavenly qi communicates with the lung. The lung governs the skin and hair and is the flowery canopy of the five *Zang*. Among the five agents, it is the *po*, and the *po* emerges and enters alongside essence. Among the five natures, it is righteousness, and righteousness overcomes things by decisive judgment. It opens at the nose, hence its fluid is nasal mucus. Nasal mucus follows weeping and precedes tears. Its sound is weeping, hence its emotion is sorrow. Sorrow is yin’s solemnity and the spirit’s bleakness.",

      "translated_text": "Its color being white corresponds to the number two. Its flavor being pungent arises from the completion of things. Thus, in heaven it is dryness, on earth it is metal, in sound it is *shang*, in odor it is rank—all bound to the numerological cycles and the categories of qi. Now, considering the channels and their exterior-interior relationships: the hand *Taiyin* is the lung channel, and the hand *Yangming* is the large intestine channel. These two channels form the *Zang-Fu* pair, united as exterior and interior.\n\nThe hand *Taiyin* channel has already been described above. Its branch emerges directly from behind the wrist, passes along the inner side of the next finger, and exits at its tip. When yin and yang are balanced, the channels and network vessels are harmonious and smooth, with fullness and emptiness naturally waxing and waning—no bias toward excess is observed. Once this balance is lost, illness arises. Excess is superabundance, and superabundance is disease. Deficiency is insufficiency, and insufficiency is also disease.\n\nDisease of superabundance is called lung repletion. Disease of insufficiency is called lung deficiency. The signs of lung repletion are wheezing, coughing, rising qi, pain in the shoulders and back, sweating, and pain in the yin thighs, knees, and channels. When lung repletion generates heat, there is panting, counterflow qi, and propped-up breathing. The hand *Taiyin* channel, assailed by heat qi, thus manifests the disease of lung repletion. In severe cases, the mouth is red and drawn taut, drinking is unrestrained, sores erupt on the back and body, and pain extends to the thighs, calves, and shins.\n\nIn lung heat disease, a chilling shudder arises in the fine hairs, with aversion to wind and cold, yellowing of the tongue, and generalized heat. When heat contends, there is wheezing, coughing, pain radiating through the chest and breast, inability to take deep breaths, unbearable headache, sweating, and cold. If qi counterflow occurs, death comes on *bing*-*ding* days; if dryness prevails, there is desiccation.\n\nAll qi oppression and stagnation pertain to the lung; all atrophy, wheezing, and retching pertain to the upper. In lung heat, the right cheek reddens first, and later the complexion turns white with hair loss. In lung wind, the eyebrows whiten. When wind evil invades during autumn’s *geng*-*xin* days, it is called lung wind. The signs of lung wind are profuse sweating, aversion to wind, a pale complexion, frequent coughing, and shortness of breath—improving by day but worsening at dusk. Diagnosis lies in the area above the eyebrows, where the color is white.\n\nIf the lung happens to be replete, it is fitting to use medicinals and pungent flavors to drain it. Employ the method of raising the chin, tilting the head back, and exhaling to treat it—without allowing the ears to hear. If the lung *Zang* is deficient and weak, injured by wind evil, then clear cold qi ascends to attack, causing a runny nose with clear mucus. This is because the lung opens at the nose and its fluid is nasal mucus. In cases of deficiency, sour flavors are used to supplement it.\n\nIn general, the method for treating repletion is to drain, and for deficiency, to supplement. For superabundance, reduce; for insufficiency, augment. This is the general outline.",

The Dao of Heaven moves northward; its image above is the Palace of Yin and Yang, and below, *Jin*. Its qi resides in the human gallbladder.\n\nThe gallbladder is the official of central rectitude, whence decisions and judgments emerge. Thus, it is the *Fu*-viscus of central essence. The Foot Lesser Yang Gallbladder Channel begins at *Jing-Well Metal* at *Qiaoyin*, two points located at the tips of the fourth and fifth toes, a leek-leaf’s width from the nail. *Ying-Spring Wood* at *Xiaxi* lies between the fourth and fifth toes, anterior to the metatarsophalangeal joint. *Shu-Stream Wood* at *Linqi* resides in the depression posterior to the metatarsophalangeal joint of the fourth and fifth toes, one and a half *cun* from *Xiaxi*. Some texts locate *Danshu* beneath the tenth vertebra, bilaterally—the origin of the gallbladder’s source. *Qiuxu*, two points below the lateral malleolus, mirrors the above. Three *cun* from *Linqi*. *Jing-River Fire* at *Yangfu* lies four *cun* above the lateral malleolus, anterior to the fibula, at the terminus of the *Juegu* bone, three *fen* as before.\n\nAt the *Ren* hour of night, the human qi resides in the Foot Lesser Yang Gallbladder Channel. By the *Zi* hour, it also dwells in the gallbladder’s network-vessels. *Jia* governs the left-hand Lesser Yang and also the disorders of the gallbladder *Fu*. *Shen*—the seventh month—governs the right-foot Lesser Yin, and the human qi concurrently resides in the right [side] with the lung. *He-Sea Earth* at *Yanglingquan*, two points in the depression one *cun* below the knee’s lateral aspect, where the gallbladder’s vessel connects to the kidney.\n\nThe Foot Lesser Yang Gallbladder Channel arises at the outer canthus of the eye, ascends to the corner of the forehead, descends behind the ear, follows the head anterior to the Hand Lesser Yang, reaches the shoulder, crosses posterior to the Hand Lesser Yang, and enters the supraclavicular fossa.\n\nIn gallbladder disease, one frequently sighs deeply, experiences a bitter taste in the mouth, and vomits stale fluid. The heart feels unsettled, as if someone were about to seize them, and the throat emits a rasping sound. Frequent spitting occurs, for the gallbladder’s movement manifests as vomiting, and its qi is courageous, hence vomiting.\n\nThe gallbladder’s disease correspondences: its image is Wood, it flourishes in spring, and its channel is the Foot Lesser Yang. It is the *Fu*-viscus of the liver, whence planning and deliberation arise. All *Fu*-viscera defer to the gallbladder for decisions. When its qi is exuberant and superabundant, disease arises within the abdomen—distress and restlessness, with the body trembling subtly. This is repletion of gallbladder qi, and draining is appropriate.\n\nWhen gallbladder qi is insufficient, its qi ascends and overflows, causing a bitter taste in the mouth, frequent deep sighs, vomiting of stale fluid, an unsettled feeling beneath the heart as if someone were about to seize them, a rasping sensation in the throat, and frequent spitting. This is deficiency of gallbladder qi, and supplementation is appropriate.\n\nIt is said: The gallbladder is the *Fu*-viscus of the liver, the Yang Foot Lesser Yang Channel. When insufficient, the gallbladder is deficient. Deficiency engenders cold, and cold gives rise to disease—fearfulness, inability to sleep alone, dizziness in the mouth and head, flaccid paralysis of the feet and toes so they cannot be moved, inability to rise from sitting, sudden collapse with fixed gaze, and a vacant demeanor. For when the gallbladder is deficient, the spirit is not secured, and its qi ascends and overflows, following its location to generate disease.\n\nIt is said: When the gallbladder is replete, it is superabundant. Superabundance engenders heat, and heat causes the spirit to be unsecured—chest oppression and vexation, dry throat, vomiting of bitter fluid, and somnolence day and night. Furthermore, abdominal qi fullness, inability to swallow food, dryness in the heart and rib-side pain preventing turning, heat on the lateral aspect of the foot—this is Yang reversal. Also, headache, pain at the outer canthus, swelling and pain in the supraclavicular fossa, swelling beneath the axilla, and *Madian Xieying* [nodules along the neck]—all are termed repletion of gallbladder qi, obstruction of the Foot Lesser Yang Channel.\n\nFor the patterns of gallbladder *Fu* deficiency and repletion, the methods of supplementation and draining, and the appropriate formulas, they are the same as those for the liver *Zang*’s exterior and interior.\n\nAs the month progresses to *Shen*, *You*, and *Xu*, it remains autumn. Autumn qi moves eastward, and autumn qi resides in Yang. Autumn flourishes in the lung, and it governs *Geng* and *Xin*.",
      "overlap_context": "reat it—without allowing the ears to hear. If the lung *Zang* is deficient and weak, injured by wind evil, then clear cold qi ascends to attack, causing a runny nose with clear mucus. This is because the lung opens at the nose and its fluid is nasal mucus. In cases of deficiency, sour flavors are used to supplement it.\n\nIn general, the method for treating repletion is to drain, and for deficiency, to supplement. For superabundance, reduce; for insufficiency, augment. This is the general outline.",

      "translated_text": "*Geng* governs the Lesser Yin of the right hand, while *Xin* governs the Greater Yin of the right hand—thus autumn qi begins above and then commences on the right. Some say it begins in the front, others in the rear. In the seventh and eighth months, human qi resides on the right with the lung; in the ninth month, it remains on the right with the heart. Autumn qi dwells in the skin and the pores of the hair, its transport points lying in the shoulders and back. When autumn qi prevails, illness arises in the lung. Autumn is injured by dampness, which ascends in counterflow to provoke coughing and atrophy reversal. Autumn qi is prone to wind-malaria; autumn injured by dampness gives rise to winter coughs. Thus, in autumn, the lung is treated with warmth yet paradoxically with coolness. The stomach qi serves as the root in autumn. The stomach is the root of the five *zang*. Only in autumn does one nourish Yin, and it is fitting to consume warming foods. When the season calls for coolness, one may distance oneself from cold. Those who follow this prosper; those who oppose it fall ill.\n\nIn regulating the spirit according to autumn qi, the pulse should be light as a feather—this is the norm. Deviation from this indicates illness. Only the sage possesses the method of following Heaven to nurture life, rising early and retiring early with the rooster, gathering and restraining the spirit and qi. Thus autumn qi is harmonized, the mind is not scattered, and the lung qi remains clear. This is the correspondence of autumn qi and the Way of nurturing harvest.\n\nNext comes *He Kui*, which precisely marks the mid-autumn month. The *Guan* hexagram of *You* aligns with the *Nan Lü* pitch. The celestial Way moves northeast; its image above is the Metal Ox Palace, below it is Zhao, and its qi resides in the human stomach. The stomach is rectitude. The spleen and stomach are the officials of the granary, from which the five flavors emerge. The spleen is the *zang*, the stomach the *fu*; the two qi of spleen and stomach stand as exterior and interior to one another, forming the *fu* of the five grains, the sea of water and grain, governing the reception and containment of food and drink. When the spleen qi grinds and dissolves, one can eat. Yet if both spleen and stomach qi are deficient, one cannot consume food or drink. This stems from overburdening the intestines and stomach with food and drink. Only those who follow the Way traverse the four seasons of Heaven and regulate the five *zang* of humanity, all with stomach qi as the root. If the qi of the *Chongyang* pulse is severed, death is untreatable.\n\nThe Foot Yangming Stomach Channel’s well point, Metal, is *Lidui*, two points located at the tip of the second toe, a leek-leaf’s width from the nail. Its spring point, Wood, is *Neiting*, two points in the depression between the first and second toes. Its stream point, Wood, is *Xiangu*, two points in the depression proximal to the second toe’s metatarsophalangeal joint, two *cun* from *Neiting*. The stomach transport point lies below the twelfth vertebra, bilateral. Its source emerges at *Chongyang*, two points five *cun* above the ankle on the dorsum of the foot, between the bones where the pulse is felt, three *cun* from *Xiangu*. Its river point, Fire, is *Jiexi*, two points one and a half *cun* posterior to *Chongyang*, in the depression above the wrist.\n\nAt *Yi* hour of the day, human qi resides in the Foot Yangming Stomach Channel. By *Chen* hour, it also dwells in the stomach’s network vessels. *Wu* governs the Greater Yang of the right hand and also governs illnesses of the stomach *fu*. *You* serves as the weft; in the eighth month, it governs the Greater Yin of the right foot, and human qi also resides on the right, in the lung.\n\nThe earth confluence is *Zusanli*, two points three *cun* below the knee, in the depression between the lateral bone and the great tendon. The Foot Yangming Stomach Channel begins at the junction of the nose and forehead, alongside the Taiyang Channel, descending along the lateral nose into the upper teeth, curving around the mouth to intersect at *Chengjiang*, then retreating along the posterior lower jaw to emerge at *Daying*. It ascends along *Jiache* to the front of the ear, passing *Kezhuren*, following the hairline to the forehead.\n\nThe stomach’s disease manifestations: the stomach corresponds to earth, flourishing in late summer, and its channel is the Foot Yangming. It is the *fu* of the spleen and the sea of water and grain. All *zang* and *fu* receive the qi of water and grain from the stomach. When qi is exuberant and in excess, it causes abdominal distension and fullness—this is repletion of stomach qi, and draining is appropriate. When stomach qi is insufficient, one is hungry yet cannot receive water or grain, suffering from undigested diarrhea and counterflow vomiting—this is deficiency of stomach qi, and supplementation is appropriate.\n\nThe discourse on stomach deficiency and cold: the Foot Yangming Stomach Channel and the Foot Taiyin form exterior and interior. Its qi favors warmth and detests cold; when warmed, it transforms water and grain. If its qi is insufficient and cold qi invades, it causes shin cold, inability to lie down, aversion to wind, shivering, eye tension, constant abdominal pain, bilateral rib-side emptiness and distension with frequent rumbling, alternating cold and heat, dry lips and mouth, facial and periorbital swelling, and inability to consume food—all due to stomach cold.\n\nThe discourse on stomach repletion and heat: when stomach qi is exuberant and replete, it becomes congested and unsmooth, accumulating to generate heat. This causes dry mouth, vexing thirst, universal yellowing of the face and eyes, delirious raving, manic agitation, generalized heat with profuse sweating, abdominal and rib-side firmness and fullness, and constipation—all its signs. Moreover, stomach qi takes food as its root, yet the five grains, fruits, and vegetables suffice for nourishment; one must not overindulge and harm one’s upright qi. Among these, meat is not mentioned, for it is forbidden by Daoists. Thus the old saying of Liu: “The Way lies in the glutton, a full belly and uninhibited urination—qi at ease.” Food is for nourishing the stomach, and the stomach communicates with the kidney, which is the stomach’s gate. Thus the *Yi*’s *Yi* hexagram speaks of nourishment. The noble person is cautious in speech and moderates food and drink—this is its meaning.\n\nWhen the Dipper points to the season of late autumn, the *Bo* hexagram of *Xu* aligns with the *Wu Yi* pitch. The celestial Way moves south; its image above is the White Sheep Palace, below it is Lu, and its qi resides in the human bladder. The bladder is the official of the reservoir, storing fluids and humors. When qi transforms, they can be discharged. It is the root of the granary and the dwelling of nourishment. Thus the kidney pairs with the bladder, both being the *fu* of fluids and humors. The classics state: the bladder stores fluids and humors, and when it receives the qi of the sea of qi to enact transformation, then urine and stool are discharged.",

      "translated_text": "If the qi of the sea of qi is insufficient, then the passages become obstructed and impassable.\n\nThe Foot Greater Yang Bladder Channel begins at *Jing*-Metal as *Zhi Yin*, with two points located on the lateral side of the little toe, a scallion-leaf’s width from the corner of the nail. Its *Rong*-Wood is *Tong Gu*, with two points on the lateral side of the little toe, in the depression anterior to the metatarsophalangeal joint. Its *Shu*-Wood is *Shu Gu*, with two points on the lateral side of the little toe, in the depression posterior to the metatarsophalangeal joint. The Bladder *Shu* point lies below the nineteenth vertebra, bilateral to the spine. The Bladder’s *Yuan* point emerges at *Jing Gu*, with two points on the lateral side of the little toe, below the prominent bone at the junction of red and white flesh.\n\nIts *Jing*-Fire is *Kun Lun*, with two points posterior to the lateral malleolus, in the depression above the heel bone. At the *Kun* hour of the day, human qi resides in the Foot Greater Yang Bladder Channel. By the *Shen* hour, human qi also dwells in the Bladder’s network vessels.\n\n*Ren* governs the left hand’s Greater Yin and also rules Bladder disorders. *Xu*, the ninth month, governs the right foot’s Reverting Yin, while human qi resides on the right and also in the heart.\n\nIts *He*-Earth is *Wei Zhong*, with two points in the popliteal crease, in the depression where the pulsating tendon is felt. The Foot Greater Yang Bladder Channel begins at the inner canthus of the eye, ascends to the forehead, and intersects at the vertex. One branch extends from the vertex to the superior angle of the ear. Its straight course enters from the vertex to bind the brain, then emerges and descends along the nape, following the inner aspect of the scapula to parallel the spine, reaching the lumbar region and traveling through the sacrum to bind the kidneys.\n\nThe kidneys pertain to the bladder. When the bladder is diseased, the lower abdomen becomes unilaterally swollen and painful; pressing it induces an urge to urinate that cannot be fulfilled. Heat in the shoulders, sunken pulse, and heat along the lateral aspect of the little toe, calf, and posterior ankle—all indicate the exhaustion of fluids and humors.\n\nIn the pathology of bladder disorders: the bladder corresponds to water and flourishes in winter; the Foot Greater Yang is its channel. It is the *fu* of the kidneys. The essences of the five grains and five flavors all converge in the bladder. Through qi transformation, they enter the blood vessels to form bone marrow, while the surplus of fluids and humors enters the bladder to become urine.\n\nWhen its qi is exuberant and in excess, heat arises as disease. If the bladder is obstructed and urine cannot pass, with unilateral swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, this is bladder qi repletion—it should be drained. When the bladder is deficient, cold ensues; if cold qi invades, the bladder becomes slippery, and urination becomes frequent and copious. A black complexion indicates bladder qi deficiency—it should be supplemented.\n\nThe *Discourse on Bladder Deficiency and Cold* states: The bladder is the *fu* of fluids and humors. When qi transforms, they can be discharged. If its qi is insufficient, deficiency arises, and deficiency invites cold qi to exploit it, causing fluids and humors to flow unchecked. Thus, the symptoms include profuse urination, severe lower abdominal pain, and pain in the nape, back, lumbar region, sacrum, popliteal fossa, and [omitted]. When the bladder fails to restrain urine, leading to enuresis, this is due to bladder deficiency and cold, resulting in frequent urination.\n\nThe *Discourse on Bladder Repletion and Heat* states: The bladder is the official of the reservoir, storing fluids and humors. When qi transforms, they can be discharged. If its qi is in excess, repletion arises, and repletion causes heat qi to linger, leading to congestion and obstruction. Internally, this manifests as urinary retention, vexation, fullness, and restlessness. Externally, it presents as generalized heat, lumbar pain, and dizziness. Thus, when the bladder fails to facilitate urination, leading to *long* (dribbling urinary block), its supplementation and drainage [omitted] follow the same principles as those for the kidney channel.\n\nNow, when the celestial Dipper points to the first month of winter, *Hai* aligns with the *Kun* hexagram, and the pitch corresponds to *Ying Zhong*. The celestial Way moves east; its image above is the Double Fish Palace, below it is Wei, and its qi resides in the human liver.\n\nThe liver is a *zang*, the gallbladder its *fu*, corresponding to wood. Its nature is warmth, its qi mild, and its note *jue*. It flourishes in spring and in the days of *Jia* and *Yi*, wanes in autumn, and perishes in *Geng* and *Xin*. The liver is the official of the general, from which strategies and plans emerge. It is the dwelling of the *hun*. Its luster appears in the nails, its filling in the sinews, and it generates blood and qi. Yet prolonged walking injures the sinews, straining the liver.\n\nWhen the liver is strained, the face and eyes become dry and dark, the mouth bitter, the spirit unsettled, and one feels fearful, unable to sleep alone, with dim vision. It is also said that great anger causes qi counterflow, injuring the liver; when the liver is injured, blood becomes scant, and the eyes darken. The liver generates anger, and anger injures the liver—thus, violent rage harms *yin* and also injures qi.\n\nWhen the liver is diseased, pain arises beneath the ribs, radiating to the lower abdomen, and one becomes prone to anger. Thus, resentment, anger, and qi counterflow that ascend without descending injure the liver. The liver opens at the eyes, manifests in the eyes, its color is green, its humor is tears, its odor is rank, and its flavor is sour. Sour flavor first enters the liver; the liver desires sourness, but excessive consumption of sourness causes the flesh to thicken and the lips to peel.\n\nThe liver suffers from tension; to relieve it, one should eat sweetness. Thus, those with liver disease should avoid pungent flavors. When the *zang* and *fu* of a person are about to become diseased, their changes and movements must manifest in countenance, complexion, and voice.\n\nWhen the liver is hot, the left cheek first reddens; if it appears green and the nails wither, this is liver wind causing the eyes to turn green. The inner canthus of the eye is *Jing Ming*, where the Hand and Foot Greater Yang, Foot Yang Brightness, Yin Heel, Yang Heel, and five vessels converge. In *jue* syndrome, the eyes see nothing; in *jue*, yang qi converges above, and yin qi converges below. When yang converges above, fire shines alone; when yin converges below, the feet become cold, and cold causes distension.\n\nAs one water cannot overcome five fires, the inner canthus becomes blind—this \"one water\" refers to the eye, while the \"five fires\" denote the *jue* yang of the five *zang*. All sinews pertain to the eyes, thus the liver nourishes the sinews. The sinews regard the knees as their *fu*; thus, all sinews gather at the genitals, and the channel terminates at the root of the tongue. Some say it binds at the tongue.\n\nThe liver’s changes and movements manifest in cries, shouts, whistling speech, yawning, stretching, and grasping.",

      "translated_text": "The Foot *Jueyin* Liver Channel: its *jing-well* (Wood) point is *Dadun*, with two points located at the tip of the big toe, a leek-leaf’s width from the nail. Its *ying-spring* (Fire) point is *Xingjian*, with two points on the big toe. The moving pulse responds here. Its *shu-stream* (Earth) point is *Taichong*, located two *cun* (or one and a half *cun*) behind the base joint of the big toe, in the moving pulse. If the pulse ceases here, death follows—it is incurable. The Liver Transport point lies below the ninth vertebra, on either side. The Liver’s *yuan-source* point emerges at *Taichong*. Its *jing-river* (Metal) point is *Zhongfeng*, with two points located one *cun* anterior to the inner ankle; they are accessed with the foot supine. At *gui* hours each night, the human *qi* resides in the Foot *Jueyin* Liver Channel. By *chou* hours, the *qi* also lingers in the Liver’s network vessels. *Yi* governs the left hand’s *Taiyang* and also rules Liver *zang* illnesses. *Hai* (the tenth month) governs the left foot’s *Jueyin* and the human *qi*, which also resides in the Heart. Its *he-sea* (Water) point is *Ququan*, with two points located below the inner knee, above the large sinew and below the small sinew in the depression. The Liver’s Foot *Jueyin* Channel begins at the hairy region of the big toe, ascends along the instep, passes one *cun* above the inner ankle, rises eight *cun* above the ankle to cross behind the *Taiyin*, then ascends along the inner knee, follows the inner thigh into the pubic hair, encircles the genitals, reaches the lower abdomen, flanks the stomach, connects to the Liver, and networks with the Gallbladder.\n\nThe balanced pulse of the Liver and Gallbladder is wiry; its predatory pulse is floating. The Liver’s *qi* is warm, harmonizing the *qi* of the Liver *zang* and sinew membranes. Thus, when evil resides in the Liver, both flanks ache, cold invades, and static blood moves internally, often causing spasms in the hands, swollen feet, and knots in the joints. Liver disease manifests in fright and terror, affecting the sinews. The Liver is forbidden to wind; it not only despises wind but also fears clarity—clarity is the command of Metal. The Liver governs spring, and its pulse is wiry and long—this is the Liver’s balanced pulse. If the pulse is deep, floating, and slippery, it is the Liver’s predatory pulse, indicating Liver *qi* deficiency. Deficiency generates cold; cold causes hardness beneath the flanks, blurred vision, black spots in the eyes, cramping sinews, a greenish complexion, brittle nails, melancholy, and fear, with an inability to sigh deeply. In severe cases, one feels constant dread, as if about to be seized. These are all signs of Liver deficiency. Excess generates heat and yang hyperactivity, leading to hardness and fullness below the heart, eye pain, red canthi, stiff neck and back, sinew spasms preventing flexion and extension. In severe cases, one becomes irascible and prone to anger—these are signs of Liver excess.\n\n**Discourse on Liver Disease Signs:**\nThe Liver resembles Wood and flourishes in spring. Its pulse is wiry, its spirit is the *hun*, its indicator is the eyes, its luster is in the nails, its filling is in the sinews, its sound is shouting, its odor is rank, its flavor is sour, its fluid is tears, its color is green, it stores blood, and its channel is the Foot *Jueyin*. It pairs with the Gallbladder to form a *fu* and governs the exterior. The Liver is a *zang* that governs containment; when Liver *qi* is abundant, it becomes blood. Excess causes disease: red eyes, pain beneath both flanks radiating to the lower abdomen, and frequent anger. If *qi* rebels, dizziness, deafness, swollen cheeks, and impaired hearing follow—this is Liver *qi* excess, and purging is appropriate. If Liver *qi* is insufficient, disease arises: blurred vision, cramping in both flanks, sinew spasms, inability to sigh deeply, brittle nails, a greenish complexion, melancholy, and fear as if about to be seized—this is Liver *qi* deficiency, and tonifying is appropriate.\n\nIn Liver heat disease, urine first turns yellow, the abdomen aches, and one sleeps excessively. When heat contends, delirium and fright follow, with fullness and pain in the flanks, restless limbs, and inability to sleep peacefully. The limbs are the root of all yang. If *qi* rebels, headache follows, with a throbbing pulse drawing upward to the head—rebellion here is akin to *jue*. The *Jueyin* Wood’s wind transformation engenders movement. Thus, when wind prevails, movement arises. Wind’s harm to humans is swift and ever-changing: when the interstices open, cold chills arise; when cold closes, heat and oppression follow. Wind injury in spring’s *jia-yi* days is called Liver wind. Liver wind’s signs include profuse sweating, aversion to wind, melancholy, a slightly greenish complexion, dry throat, frequent anger, and occasional hatred of women. Diagnosis lies beneath the eyes, where the color is green.\n\n**Discourse on Liver Disease and Sinew Spasms:**\nLiver disease with sinew spasms occurs because the Liver unites with the sinews. When the Foot *Jueyin* Channel is insufficient, the vessels fail to nourish. Without nourishment, wind evil easily invades, contending with the sinews and vessels, causing spasms and contractions. Moreover, the Liver stores wind toxin, and *qi* pours into the arms, head, neck, shoulders, back, waist, and feet, causing sinew spasms, cramping, piercing pain, or swollen limbs, dizziness, black spots obscuring vision, vomiting, hiccups, and reduced appetite. Generally, facial swelling is called wind—wind is yang *qi*. Thus, all wind tremors and dizziness belong to the Liver, and all sudden rigidity belongs to wind.\n\n**Wind Strike:**\nWind strike occurs when wind *qi* invades a person. Wind is the *qi* of the four seasons, distributed across the eight directions, governing the growth and nourishment of all things. Wind coming from its native direction causes few deaths or illnesses. Wind from non-native directions causes many deaths and illnesses. When it causes disease, it lurks between the skin and flesh, internally unable to penetrate and externally unable to disperse. When it enters the channels and vessels, moving through the five *zang*, it generates disease in each *zang* and *fu* accordingly. In Liver wind strike, one can only squat and cannot lower the head. If greenish color encircles both eyes and extends to the forehead, with greenish lips and a yellowish face, it is treatable. There is also *xi* wind and fan wind, which strike people subtly.",
      "overlap_context": " five fires, the inner canthus becomes blind—this \"one water\" refers to the eye, while the \"five fires\" denote the *jue* yang of the five *zang*. All sinews pertain to the eyes, thus the liver nourishes the sinews. The sinews regard the knees as their *fu*; thus, all sinews gather at the genitals, and the channel terminates at the root of the tongue. Some say it binds at the tongue.\n\nThe liver’s changes and movements manifest in cries, shouts, whistling speech, yawning, stretching, and grasping.",

      "translated_text": "Severe wind escalates into *li* wind, where wind-cold lingers in the vessels without departing—this is called *li* wind. It may also be named cold-heat. Thus, all winds归属于liver wind, the origin of the hundred diseases. Like bandit winds that strike repeatedly, or vacuous evils that assail morning and night, one must avoid them as one would avoid arrows and stones. When the liver is replete, drain it with sour; employ *xu* qi to [treat] its vacuity, and supplement it with acrid. Avoid drafts—this is the model of nurturing life.\n\nAs the seasonal nodes shift, the months of *hai*, *zi*, and *chou* remain winter, when winter *qi* moves south. In the tenth month, human *qi* resides on the left with the heart; in the eleventh and twelfth months, it also lies on the left with the kidneys. Winter *qi* begins at the *biao* (exterior), which is both the head and the tail. Some say it begins at the front, with winter *qi* in the bone marrow, its *shu* points at the waist and thighs—the waist being the palace of the kidneys. Winter *qi* resides in the kidneys and also in the yin, affecting the four limbs. In winter, one is prone to *bi* impediment and reversal, while yang diseases arise in winter.\n\nIn the eleventh month, human *qi* lies on the left with the kidneys. Moreover, winter rules the kidneys, corresponding to *ren* and *gui*. *Ren* governs the left hand’s Greater Yin, while *gui* governs the right hand’s Lesser Yin. Winter takes stomach *qi* as its root, so in winter, one nurtures yin and should eat warming foods. To treat the kidneys with heat yet counter with cold at this time—there are methods for harmonizing the spirit: rise late and retire early, awaiting sunlight, avoiding cold and seeking warmth, and not allowing sweat to leak from the skin. This is winter’s response to the Dao of storing and nurturing.\n\nIf one does not distance oneself from cold, cold will arrive; when cold arrives, hardness and blockage ensue, giving rise to abdominal fullness, pain, urgency, and diarrhea. Its pulse is like stone. To act contrary is to invite illness. Thus, heaven employs cold, and one may distance oneself from cold. Following this preserves life; opposing it harms the kidneys. The kidneys loathe dryness and also fear dampness—dampness being the *qi* of earth.\n\nIf one is harmed by cold in winter, one will surely contract warm disease in spring. Among the hundred diseases of humanity, none is greater than harm from cold. Its patterns: on the first day, Greater Yang receives it; on the second, Yang Brightness receives it; on the third, Lesser Yang receives it; on the fourth, Greater Yin receives it; on the fifth, Lesser Yin receives it; on the sixth, Reverting Yin receives it. By the seventh day, Greater Yang’s disease wanes; by the eighth, Yang Brightness’ disease wanes; by the ninth, Lesser Yang’s disease wanes; by the tenth, Greater Yin’s disease wanes; by the eleventh, Lesser Yin’s disease wanes; by the twelfth, Reverting Yin’s disease wanes. This is the waxing and waning transmission among the twelve channels. If contrary, three cycles will pass before it ceases. These three cycles refer to the three yin and three yang channels of the hands and feet.\n\nOnly the perfected of antiquity did not contract warm disease in spring, for they stored essence in the kidneys. Essence is the root of the body. The *Classic* states: \"Essence, blood, nature, and life are one with the Dao.\" Thus, the sage treasures essence, for essence is most true. From ancient times to the present, those called \"true persons\" excel at being unborn and untransformed, merging with the Dao as one. This is what is meant by \"not being transformed into a human.\" They can transform others, but if one nurtures life and honors existence, not contracting warm disease is profound—this is called \"wondrous truth.\"\n\nAs the shadow shifts and the Dipper moves, the proper alignment of the mid-winter month is *zi*, where the *Fu* hexagram’s first nine yang line is born, revealing the heart of heaven and earth. This remains winter, and at this juncture, in the north of *Kan*, the Dark Heavenly Thearch manifests boundless transformations, presiding over the karmic retribution of good and evil in the human realm, its influence clear as echo and shadow. The pitch corresponds to Yellow Bell.\n\nThe Dao of heaven binds the southeast; its image above is the Precious Cauldron Palace, and below, the state of *Qi*. Its *qi* resides in the human kidneys. The kidneys are the *zang*, the bladder the *fu*; their phase is water, their nature severe, their *qi* cold. Bitter cold harms the form. Their note is *yu*, they rule in winter, are cut off in the *ji* season, and die on *wu* and *ji* days.\n\nThe kidneys are the official of strength and skill, from which ingenuity arises. They are the dwelling of essence. Their luster is in the hair, their filling in the bone marrow. The kidneys have two lobes: the left is the kidney that stores will, where joyful will and spirit guard within; the right is the life-gate that stores essence. The kidneys are yin *qi*, the root of the five *zang*, governing the body’s bones, marrow, and teeth. Teeth are the root of bones, also called the surplus of bone. Yet standing too long harms the bones, straining the kidneys.\n\nWhen the kidneys are taxed, the back is difficult to bend or raise, urination is unsmooth, the color is reddish-yellow with lingering dribbling, the penis aches internally, the genitals are damp, sores appear on the scrotum, and the lower abdomen is full and tense. It is also said: exerting strength to lift heavy objects or sitting too long on damp ground harms the kidneys. When the kidneys are harmed, essence is scant, the waist and back ache, and reversal cold ensues.\n\nThe kidneys open at the ears and the anterior and posterior yin. Their condition is observed at the ears. Their color is black, their fluid is saliva, their odor is putrid, their flavor is salty. Salty first enters the kidneys; the kidneys desire salty, but salty courses through the blood. In blood disease, do not eat much salt. Eating too much salt causes the vessels to congeal, the complexion to darken, and the flesh to contract, while heart *qi* rebels and great bone *qi* is affected.\n\nTaxing the kidneys values nurturing the bones, so kidney yin disease arises in the bones. If one cannot stand or walk for long, the bones will tremble and weaken. If one then overexerts, kidney *qi* is harmed, and the high bones are damaged. Those who attain strength live; those who lose it die. The kidneys desire firmness, so eat bitter to firm them. Bitter supplements, salty drains. The kidneys suffer from dryness and urgency, so eat acrid to moisten them. The kidneys loathe dryness and also fear dampness—dampness being the *qi* of earth.\n\nWhen essence and *qi* converge in the kidneys, fear arises. The kidneys generate fear, and fear harms them. The kidneys forbid scorched, scalding hot food, warm grilled clothing, or heated garments. If there is illness, ask what flavors the patient desires to know the disease’s origin. In kidney disease, observe the complexion externally.",

      "translated_text": "The *slow pulse* indicates cold and pain. All yin conditions pertain to cold; when cold prevails, the pulse floats, water stagnates, and edema swells.\n\nThe *bound pulse* indicates phlegm, rheum, blood, and *qi*. Within the span of one day and night—13,500 breaths—a pulse that halts and then resumes may be called *bound*. It is also described as moving to and fro, gathering and then retreating, hence *bound*. When the four limbs grow sluggish and pain strikes intermittently, this is the affliction of the *bound pulse*.\n\nThe *intermittent pulse* arises when one organ fails and another takes its place. Its manifestations include emaciation, an inability to speak—clear signs of exhausted innate essence.\n\nThe *stirring pulse* indicates pain, fright, spasms, diarrhea, and terror. When yang seeks to descend but yin resists, or yin seeks to ascend but yang resists, the two forces contend, unable to move up or down. The pulse surges and strikes, rising abruptly—thus the form of the *stirring pulse* appears. Where yang stirs, yang is deficient; where yin stirs, yin is deficient.\n\nThe classics state: *The pulse determines life and death, governs all diseases, and regulates deficiency and excess—one cannot be ignorant of it.* To treat excess as excess and deficiency as deficiency is to harm the insufficient and augment the abundant—such a course leads clearly to death.\n\nNow, the etymology of *pulse*: the human pulse corresponds to the moon, governed by the single trigram *Kan*. As water and moon, it is marked by a dot—representing the high waters of the upper pool. The middle is the central pool, its waters deep and still. The lower is the surging pulse of the multitude. When the *ying* streams feed the great ravines, the three waters flow and irrigate, granting enduring longevity. This inexhaustible fluid nearly approaches the Dao.\n\nThe ancients taught: *The kidney’s meridians belong to water—this single drop from the upper pool has sustained me to this day.* The art of nurturing life lies in regulating *qi*. The kidney stores the *qi* of bone marrow; kidney *qi* is cold and biting. Cold is yin *qi*. When cold evil invades the kidney, it causes bone pain and yin impediment. Yin impediment resists palpation, brings abdominal distension, lumbar pain, difficult defecation, and intermittent dizziness with pain in the shoulders, back, neck, and nape.\n\nKidney disease manifests as swollen cheeks and throat, panting, coughing, heaviness of the body, night sweats, and aversion to wind. The kidney’s afflictions reach the small junctions of flesh and sinew, even to the bone marrow.\n\nThe kidney’s correspondences: it resembles water, rules in winter, and its pulse is stone-like and deep. Its orifice is the ear, its sound is groaning, its odor is putrid, its flavor is salty, its fluid is spittle, it nourishes the bones, its color is black, and its spirit is the will. It belongs to the Foot Lesser Yin meridian and pairs with the bladder. The bladder is the *fu* organ, governing the exterior; the kidney is the *zang* organ, governing the interior. When kidney *qi* flourishes, it becomes the will. In excess, it causes abdominal distension, undigested diarrhea, bodily swelling, panting, coughing, sweating, aversion to wind, dark complexion, and yellow urine—this is kidney *qi* in excess, and purging is required. When kidney *qi* is insufficient, it causes reversal cold in the limbs, lumbar and dorsal chill, chest pain, tinnitus or deafness—this is kidney *qi* in deficiency, and supplementation is required.\n\nA comprehensive discussion of the kidney: the Foot Lesser Yin meridian of the kidney and the Foot Greater Yang meridian of the bladder stand as exterior and interior. They rule in winter, resemble water, and their pulse is deep. They nourish the bone marrow, their spirit is essence and will, their orifice is the ear, their sound is groaning, their odor is putrid, their flavor is salty, their fluid is spittle, their color is black, and their *qi* is closed and stored. Thus, one should retire early and rise late, awaiting daylight, avoiding cold and seeking warmth, disturbing nothing. This is the Dao of nurturing the *zang* in accordance with yang. To oppose winter’s *qi* is to diminish yin’s storage, leaving kidney *qi* alone and sunken.\n\nIts symptoms include lower abdominal distension and fullness, yellow-red urine with lingering dribbling, frequent and painful urination—this is kidney excess. In kidney heat disease, lumbar pain arises first, followed by aching shins, bitter thirst, frequent drinking, and fever. Generally, winter brings cold damage, spring brings warm epidemics, and summer brings heat disease. When heat contends, the nape grows painful and stiff, the shins cold and aching, the feet hot, and speech is unwelcome. If the condition reverses, the nape pain becomes dull and indistinct.\n\nWhen kidney heat is in excess, it generates wind, darkening the skin and flesh. If in winter, *ren* and *gui* days, evil invades, it becomes kidney wind. The symptoms of kidney wind include profuse sweating, aversion to wind, facial swelling, spinal pain preventing upright posture, a sooty complexion, and difficulty with private matters. Diagnosis lies in the skin’s black hue—thus the kidney resembles water. Its *qi* is cold and biting, for cold is yin *qi*.\n\nWhen kidney evil enters the liver, tears turn cold; in excess, they congeal into weeping, accompanied by sinew spasms and tension, as well as bone pain. When the kidney transmits cold to the liver, it causes abscesses and shortness of breath. The liver stores blood; when cold enters, yang *qi* fails to disperse, so blood congeals and *qi* stagnates. When evil resides in the kidney, it causes bone pain and yin impediment. Yin impediment resists palpation, brings abdominal distension, lumbar pain, difficult defecation, and intermittent dizziness with pain in the shoulders, back, neck, and nape.\n\nGenerally, when wind, cold, and damp *qi* converge, they cause impediment. When cold prevails, the pulse floats, water stagnates, and edema swells. When kidney will and *qi* are insufficient, reversal *qi* surges upward. If kidney *qi* is assailed by evil, water cannot moisten downward, leading to desiccation and dryness—hence difficult defecation. All cold causes contraction and withdrawal, all belonging to the kidney. All reversal, constipation, and leakage belong to the lower body. All diseases where fluids are clear and cold belong to cold.\n\nIn treatment, avoid cold in cold seasons; if violated, cold arrives. When cold arrives, it hardens, causing abdominal fullness and pain, and urgent diarrhea arises. Thus, cold harms the form. If blockage and obstruction occur, with lumbar and dorsal stiffness, reduced appetite, and fatigue, this is kidney deficiency.\n\nIf a person suffers two internal insufficiencies—first, *long* disease with tens of urinations a day; second, the Greater Yin pulse faint and fine as a hair—then their death is clearly imminent.",

Combining qi and flavor in ingestion can replenish essence and augment qi. For kidney deficiency, use bitter to tonify. For excess, use salty to purge. Thus, the methods for regulating qi involve blowing treatments, with restoration and peace as the aim—this is the general outline of the art.\n\nAs the year wanes and transforms, the cold stars conclude in the final month of winter, when the *chou* earthly branch governs the *Lin* hexagram, and the pitch aligns with *Great Regulator*. The celestial Dao moves westward; its image above is the *Grinding Palace*, below is *Wu*, and its qi resides in the human spleen. The spleen is the *zang*-organ, the stomach its *fu*-organ, both symbolizing earth. It flourishes in the late seasons, wanes in spring, and perishes in *jia-yi* days. Its note is *gong*, its color yellow, its nature both tranquil and harmonious. It nourishes the flesh, manifests in the lips, savors sweetness, emits fragrance, produces saliva, and expresses itself in song.\n\nThe spleen stores intention and generates thought; excessive thought harms the spleen. The spleen is the official of the granary and the root of the body’s encampment. When spleen qi converges, the five flavors emerge. Its bloom and glory appear in the four whites of the lips, and its fullness resides in the muscles. As human flesh corresponds to earth, prolonged sitting injures it, for the flesh labors on behalf of the spleen. When the spleen labors, the root of the tongue becomes stiff and bitter, making it difficult to swallow saliva.\n\nIt is also said that excessive fullness injures the spleen. When the spleen is injured, one tends to belch, desires to lie down, appears yellow in the face, and speaks with effort. Fatigue from food and exertion harms the spleen, which opens at the mouth; when the spleen is harmonious, one discerns the five grains. The spleen is the utmost yin within yin, its earthly position in the southwest, flourishing in the fourth month of each season—yet in winter, one should not lift the heels, as in the months of *chen*, *wei*, and *xu*.\n\nThose who cultivate life must attend particularly to the spleen. Craving sweetness, sweetness first enters the spleen and flesh. For those with flesh ailments, avoid excessive sweetness, for it causes bone pain and hair loss. The spleen desires moderation; consume sweetness to relax it. The spleen suffers from dampness; urgently consume bitter to dry it. The spleen forbids warm clothing, overfullness, damp ground, and wet garments. It detests dampness and fears wind, for wind is the command of wood.\n\nWhen essence and qi converge in the spleen, those who fear spleen heat exhibit yellow complexion and twitching flesh, with the nose reddening first. The nose occupies the center of the face, where earth flourishes. Its changes and movements manifest in song, joy, retching, belching, and swallowing sounds.\n\nThe Foot Greater Yin Spleen Channel begins at *Hidden White*, two points on the inner tip of the big toe, a leek-leaf’s width from the nail. Its fire spring is *Great Metropolis*, two points in the depression behind the big toe’s base joint. Its earth transport is *Great White*, two points in the depression below the inner ankle’s prominence. The spleen’s transport point lies below the eleventh vertebra on either side. Its source emerges at *Great White*. Its metal channel is *Shang Mound*, two points in the depression slightly anterior to the inner ankle. At *xun* (9–11 a.m.), human qi resides in the Foot Greater Yin Spleen Channel. By *si* (9–11 a.m.), qi also flows through the spleen’s network vessels. *Si* governs the Lesser Yang of the right hand, and its qi also governs spleen organ diseases. *Chou* (1–3 a.m.), the twelfth month, governs the Lesser Yin of the left foot, where human qi also resides in the left and in the kidneys.\n\nIts water convergence is *Yin Mound Spring*, two points below the knee on the inner side of the lower leg, beneath the auxiliary bone. The Foot Greater Yin Spleen Channel arises at the big toe’s tip, follows the inner white flesh of the toe, passes behind the ankle bone, ascends the anterior edge of the inner ankle, then the inner shin, crossing in front of the Jueyin to ascend the inner anterior thigh into the abdomen, where it connects to the spleen and networks the stomach. It ascends the diaphragm, flanks the throat, connects to the root of the tongue, and disperses beneath it.\n\nThus, the spleen’s balanced pulse is moderate; its perverse pulse is wiry. When the pulse deviates from constancy, qi follows. The spleen stores the qi of muscles and flesh. When spleen qi converges, if evil resides in the spleen, the stomach falls ill, and the muscles ache. The spleen’s disease affects the root of the tongue; thus, its transport point lies in the spine’s center.\n\nSpleen disease manifests as heaviness in the body, flaccid muscles, weak feet that cannot be lifted, and a tendency to cramp, with pain under the soles. The spleen’s correspondences: it symbolizes earth, flourishes in late summer, its pulse is moderate, its orifice the mouth, its sound song, its odor fragrance, its flavor sweetness, its fluid saliva, its nourishment the flesh, its color yellow, and it stores intention. The Foot Greater Yin is its channel, paired with the stomach, which is the *fu*-organ governing the exterior. The spleen is the *zang*-organ governing containment.\n\nWhen spleen qi is exuberant, it shapes the form; in excess, it causes illness: abdominal distension and fullness, inhibited urination, heaviness in the body, constant hunger, weak feet that cannot be lifted, a tendency to cramp, and pain under the soles—this is spleen qi excess, and purging is appropriate. When spleen qi is insufficient, the four limbs fail to function, with undigested food in diarrhea, vomiting, counterflow, abdominal distension, and borborygmi—this is spleen qi deficiency, and tonifying is appropriate.\n\nIn summary, the spleen resides in the center, flourishing in mid-summer and the fourth month of each season. Its pulse arrives large and moderate—this is the spleen’s balanced pulse. If it is deep, fine, and weak, the spleen is deficient. Deficiency causes abdominal fullness, undigested food, vomiting, diarrhea, inability to use the four limbs, shortness of breath, aversion to human voices, and dreams of insufficient food—all signs of spleen deficiency.\n\nWhen the yin pulse at the right *guan* position is tight and replete, the spleen is in excess. Excess manifests as heaviness in the body, inability to turn, heat and oppression in the chest, dry and scorched lips, cheek pain, heart vexation, throat discomfort, sores at the root of the tongue, deep and heavy speech, dreams of singing and music, and lassitude in the four limbs—these are signs of spleen excess.\n\nIn spleen heat disease, the head first feels heavy, the cheeks ache, the heart is vexed, the complexion turns green, and one desires to vomit with fever. Excessive heat relaxes the sinews, dissolves the bones, and melts the flesh. When heat contends fiercely, lumbar pain arises, making bending and lifting impossible, with abdominal fullness, diarrhea, pain in both cheeks, and counterflow—death occurs on *jia-yi* days.",
      "overlap_context": "avoid cold in cold seasons; if violated, cold arrives. When cold arrives, it hardens, causing abdominal fullness and pain, and urgent diarrhea arises. Thus, cold harms the form. If blockage and obstruction occur, with lumbar and dorsal stiffness, reduced appetite, and fatigue, this is kidney deficiency.\n\nIf a person suffers two internal insufficiencies—first, *long* disease with tens of urinations a day; second, the Greater Yin pulse faint and fine as a hair—then their death is clearly imminent.",

The signs of spleen wind include profuse sweating with aversion to wind, lassitude in the body, reluctance to move the four limbs, a pale and slightly yellow complexion, and loss of appetite.

      "translated_text": "Master Li Jingyuan of the True Origin Gate offers this commentary:\n\nThe physician Lu exhaustively examined the five viscera, noting that within the human throat lie three passages: one for food, one for qi, and one for water, each sequentially propelling the others. The passages for food and water share a single orifice, converging together into the stomach. The upper orifice leads to the lungs, connecting to the Greater Yin meridian, descending through the abdomen, reaching the spine’s center, then circling beneath the navel to join the Conception, Thoroughfare, and Governing Vessels at the Cinnabar Field—the sea of generative qi. Three inches below the navel, spanning four inches in width, it adheres between the spine and the two kidneys. Known also as the Great Sea, within its waters dwells a spirit-turtle that draws in primordial qi, circulating it upward past the navel, weaving through the stomach, penetrating the liver and diaphragm, and entering the lungs. Here, the ascending and descending qi facilitate the ebb and flow of breath, for this is the sole passage above the lungs. The passages for water and food both enter the stomach, entirely dependent on the qi of the Cinnabar Field to transform and transmute their essence. Water and grain separate into the pure and turbid, traversing the small and large intestines, where the interplay of yin and yang qi governs their transformation and transmission. When yang qi prevails, water and grain are refined; when yin qi dominates, the dregs remain unrefined, giving rise to cold and pain. This occurs when yang is obstructed by yin and fails to descend, or when yin, lacking yang, fails to ascend—such is the principle of yin and yang’s ascent and descent.\n\nBelow the throat, the two lobes of the lungs appear, serving as the Florid Canopy that shelters all the viscera. Beneath the lungs lies the heart, enveloped in a yellow fatty membrane of a reddish-yellow hue. The heart’s form is pointed, elongated, round, and flat, its color a blend of black, red, green, and yellow, with pores distinct and unalike. Below the heart lies the diaphragm, and beneath that, the stomach, coiled to hold several *sheng* of matter, encased in a yellow fatty membrane resembling a banner’s flame. To the left lies the liver with its two lobes, the shorter of which bears the gallbladder. Beside the stomach on the left rests the spleen, sharing its membrane, resembling horse liver in its reddish-purple hue. Below lies the small intestine, coiled in fifteen loops, gleaming and pure, transmuting and conveying matter. To the right lies the large intestine, coiled in sixteen loops, containing dregs and enveloped in yellow fat, clumped together. Below resides the bladder, also gleaming and pure, lacking any external orifice, entirely reliant on the process of transformation—whereby fluids enter as urine.\n\nThe *Inner Canon* states: “The bladder is the official of the reservoir; fluids are stored therein, and through qi transformation, they are expelled.” To the right lies the passage through which the large intestine expels its dregs. Of the five viscera’s true essence, only the kidneys serve as the root. When the kidneys are deficient, water is insufficient. Many resort to drying medicines, unaware of their harm, yet nothing surpasses nourishing them with flavors to supplement their essence. Alas, the lungs as the yin mother are now made clear. Having thoroughly examined the principles of the viscera and bowels, one may observe the reflections of the five viscera upon the back’s transport points, discerning the pathways of life and death. This is the sage’s method of reversing the Yellow River’s flow. Only by practicing this formula can one attain the principle of longevity.\n\nObserve the fourteenth vertebra below, on either side at a distance of one *cun* and five *fen*, where the two kidneys reside. Each is enveloped in yellow fat as a single mass, with two connecting bands serving as the kidneys’ great meridians. Passing behind the *Pingyi* point and beneath the spine, there lies a large bone at the spine’s end, roughly half a hand in size. Between them lie two points, the kidneys’ meridians. These ascend along the spine to the *Niwan* and *Naohu* within the brain—the sea of marrow. Should one master this art of circulation, preventing reckless leakage and reversing the flow to reach the *Niwan*, it becomes the Great Elixir, enabling longevity and enduring vision.\n\nThis Dao was attained by the Yellow Emperor, who thereby ascended to heaven. Later, Anqi Sheng lived for three thousand years, and Peng Zu for eight hundred, as recorded in the *Biographies of Divine Transcendents*. Thus, both ascension and extended life in the world are possible. The Radiant Master’s external elixir elucidates the subtle and profound, while the internal qi illuminates the source of fetal breathing. Though the effort may not span a full decade, others marvel at one’s agelessness, for the span of life already exceeds five cycles. One feels renewed, for within the body lies the path to heaven, and upon the back, who lacks the mark of transcendence? From the *Jiaji* to the crown, this is the direct route of cultivation. Frequently swallow the Jade Fluid of the Flowery Pond, and the Primordial Lord of the Purple Palace will send it upward. Constantly ensure qi penetrates the joints, and naturally, essence will fill and the Valley Spirit will abide.\n\nOnce the external medicine’s fire is understood, the internal elixir’s reverse flow is perpetually activated. Even if a thousand years pass before we meet again, you will appear as youthful as today. Do not say the Great Dao is difficult to comprehend—it is only that the stubborn refuse to learn immortality.\n\nMaster Liu expounded the Supreme Qi Formula. Some, afflicted by illness or suffering, may scoff at it in neglect, failing to grasp its profound workings. Misapplication yields no results, and thus they dismiss it. Recently, a woman possessed by a ghost was exorcised by a Junior Master, but the ghost turned and pursued him. Fleeing past the True Lord’s hall, the Teacher immediately perceived the situation and swiftly captured the ghost’s spirit. After the exorcism, they discussed the details. On that day, a *jiazi* day, the Junior Master had dispatched the *yichou* spirit generals and soldiers, who were thus repelled. The Teacher, however, employed the *jiazi* day’s own spirit generals and soldiers, thereby capturing the ghost. Thus, in the Orthodox Unity method, even a hair’s breadth of deviation leads to such outcomes—how much more so for the qi formula, where misapplication guarantees no results, inviting scorn and neglect.\n\nAmidst the vast expanse of scriptures, those seeking to exhaust the sources of illness find it swiftly daunting. Yet by distilling the essentials, clarifying symptoms becomes effortless upon opening the text. Is this not the very virtue of those who cultivate the body—to attain health and well-being, and to advance in the wondrous Dao of the True? How magnificent indeed!",

      "translated_text": "The disciples of the True Origin School addressed the enlightened youths: To govern the heavens and punish evil, nothing surpasses transmitting the scriptures and exhorting goodness.\n\nOn the seventh day of the first lunar month in the *wuchen* year, reverently reflecting upon the Teacher, I recall how Confucius—the very paragon of the sages—still inquired of Laozi about rites and sought counsel from Chang Hong on music. How then could I, a fool, dare not honor my master? Especially when the master, in boundless benevolence, bestowed the *Scripture of Enlightenment*, which, in its essence, expounds the August Heavenly Worthy as the sovereign of the Way of ruler and minister, father and son.\n\nThus, when cultivated throughout the world, it speaks of the sagely ruler’s Way, prizing benevolence and love for all under heaven. When cultivated within a state, it speaks of the loyal minister’s Way, prizing reverence and obedience to superiors. When cultivated among ministers, it speaks of the Way of assisting governance, prizing respect, kindness, and righteousness. When cultivated within the family, it speaks of the filial and fraternal Way, prizing ritual, music, and harmony. When cultivated in the self, it speaks of the Way of emptiness and quiescence, prizing the preservation of harmonious qi. Only when none of these are lacking may one be deemed fit for the gate of the Wondrous True.\n\nNext was bestowed the *Scripture of Extended Models*, which reveals the August Teaching Lord who enlightens all beings. It begins with the standards of virtue and the Five Constants, proceeds to the nurturing of harmonious qi, and concludes with the precepts for luminous illumination and abiding in the world. Through unwavering diligence, one may attain union with the palace of the Wondrous True.\n\nFollowing this was the *Scripture of the True Origin*, which expounds the Lord of the True Origin, emphasizing the transformation of unwholesome traits. Through great compassion, one cultivates inner emptiness and non-action while outwardly manifesting numinous transformation for the benefit of all. Such is the practice rightly called the True Origin.\n\nThen was granted the *Scripture of the Great Cavern*, which reveals the August Emperor of the Mysterious and Infinitesimal Heavenly Palace, unfolding the dragon-script canon of the Great Cavern and bequeathing the phoenix-records of the True Origin’s precepts. Herein lies the mystery of the Feminine One and the secrecy of the Masculine One. Heaven and Earth attain clarity and tranquility through it; the sun and moon gain their luminous radiance; yin and yang ascend and flourish; and all beings endure in harmony. Should one study the Great Cavern, mastering the wondrous existence and true non-being, and harmonizing virtue and power, one merges with the Wondrous True.\n\nSubsequently were bestowed the *Charts and Writings of the Great Cavern* and the *Natural Chapters*, which declare that humans receive their nature from Heaven and Earth, and the Dao models itself upon spontaneity. All that has form yet lacks sentience arises from this singular source. Thus, the sage does not act before things do, nor does he precede them. Instead, he follows their natural course and extends it. As for the celestial patterns and charts, even the sun and moon adhere to their measures—how could great and small lack their proper bounds? All things that come into being possess them. Therefore, the myriad beings bear yin on their backs and embrace yang in their arms, harmonizing through the qi of the center. Those who attain harmony live; those who lose it—what can be said of them?\n\nFinally was granted the *Scripture of the Wondrous True*, which first clarifies the Lord of the Mysterious and Infinitesimal Heaven, transmitting the non-actional Dao of the Imperial One of the Empty Cavern and Wondrous True. It then expounds the life-generating virtue of the Lord of the Jade-Conserving Heaven, who bestows the Eastern Florescence and the Wondrous Existence. Lastly, it sets forth the teachings of the Lord of the Great Vermilion Heaven, spreading the numinous non-being and the singular transformation of the Primal Human. It further regulates the twelve meridians, prizing peace, harmony, and joy. Only then may one gather the Way of wondrous existence and the lineage of true non-being. Thus, the primordial qi becomes the foundation of life and transformation, and the yang spirit the mystery of transcendence. When virtue and power are harmonized, one is called the Wondrous True.\n\nThe above scriptures and models all transform beings, swiftly correcting wrongdoing and hastening them toward the good Way. For those who leave the household to cultivate the Dao, there are exalted and enlightened masters to guide them. For those who remain in the world to revere the True, are there not the celestial teachings to instruct them?\n\nThe Buddhist verse:\n*Bright moon divides its form, ever renewed in every place,*\n*Can the white-robed fall behind those who comprehend emptiness?*\n*Who says the laity hinder the cultivation of the Dao?*\n*Golden Grain once took the form of the Elder’s body.*\n\nWhen grasped in the heart, the foul *ilan* becomes the sandalwood tree. When the essence is lost, even nectar turns to a garden of thorns and brambles.\n\nThe *Dongbin* verse:\n*Rolling waves of desire, who will board the immortal’s ferry?*\n*The Dao lies hidden, nameless—yet the body abides in the Dao.*\n*Dual principles □ the principle—this is called the True Origin.*\n\nThus, those who grasp the essentials may conclude with a single word. Those who do not know the essentials scatter endlessly.\n\nAlas! Many revere the Dao without thought, yet few encounter its truth. How lamentable that the few who err may yet be corrected, but when the many err, none can be saved. What is to be done?\n\nEven the Teaching Lord, though noble as the Son of Heaven, deeply mourned this. How much more so for the ignorant—how could they attain realization? Yet the wise and enlightened, though they may stumble, need only glimpse the Wondrous True Dao to perceive it with luminous clarity, following the path of the ranked immortals. Should one encounter it, one must strive with utmost diligence.\n\nA sojourner in the land of Great Liang, once reduced to beggary, on the *zhengyuan* day of the *wuchen* year, received from the master these scriptures in their entirety. Yet I marveled at their completeness, and in transcribing them, errors crept into the seal script. From afar, I yearn for the recovery of these texts. May the noble scholars correct and encourage, for such is the way of tireless instruction—would this not be fitting?\n\nLong ago, on the *shangyuan* day of the *jiazi* year, while engaged in purification rites at the True Origin Abbey, the August Heavenly Emperor of the Dark Mystery suddenly descended, delivering a divine pronouncement: \"The precious precepts of the Wondrous True originated with Emperor Yao and are the incarnate response of the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Virtue from the Upper Realm. They may be transmitted to the virtuous; this foolish old man has benefited greatly.\" With reverence, I bathed and recorded this, tracing its source and intent, wishing to elucidate its teachings.",
      "overlap_context": "to such outcomes—how much more so for the qi formula, where misapplication guarantees no results, inviting scorn and neglect.\n\nAmidst the vast expanse of scriptures, those seeking to exhaust the sources of illness find it swiftly daunting. Yet by distilling the essentials, clarifying symptoms becomes effortless upon opening the text. Is this not the very virtue of those who cultivate the body—to attain health and well-being, and to advance in the wondrous Dao of the True? How magnificent indeed!",

      "translated_text": "Those who possess incomplete or defective versions of the *Daoist Canon* shall not accept them. Thus, I have distilled its essentials, pruned its redundancies, and devoted this work to the lofty scholars of the Mysterious Dao. Upon perusal, may they advance in the Way with clarity and strive without hesitation.\n\nI have learned that the Wondrous Non-Ultimate Supreme Emperor initiated the Great Cavern’s Mysterious Truth, first bestowing the title of Jade Clarity’s Celestial Lord, Master of the Teachings of Equal Heaven, to propagate the wind of the Dao and illuminate virtue, and to chastise evil while exhorting goodness. In this latter age, disciples fortunate enough to encounter such rare treasures seek to repay their masters’ benevolence—no endeavor surpasses the expansion of the scriptural model. To cultivate one’s own perfection alone, delighting solely in the Three Caverns, how does this compare to sharing its bounty widely across the nine directions, that all may together bathe in the Mysterious Blessing? This is the sincere aspiration of my heart.\n\nDisciple of the True Origin, your servant Li Jingyuan, declares: With reverence, I have received the soaring decree of the Protector Sage. As in the time of Emperor Yao, this is the incarnate response of the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Virtue from the Upper Realm. Here lies the Wondrous True Precious Text, now reproduced in print by the reclusive scholar of Liang. After purificatory rites and offerings at the shrine, I submit this memorial, further entreating that it be distributed among booksellers, ensuring its transmission throughout the commanderies. May all, in emulation, chastise evil and exhort goodness, aligning with the Heavenly Dao.\n\nWith humble devotion, this solitary servant seeks to exhaust his sincerity, dedicating these meritorious virtues to the august sovereign emperor of the great dynasty, praying for his boundless longevity. May the crown prince enjoy countless years, and may the various princes, ministers, and aides likewise attain enduring lifespans, sharing in the fortune of eternal peace. Thus concludes the *Sequel to the Profound Source of the Dao and the Cavern of True Mystery*.",
