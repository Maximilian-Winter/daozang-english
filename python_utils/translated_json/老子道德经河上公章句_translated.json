  "full_translation": "**Laozi’s *Daodejing* with Commentary by Heshang Gong**\n**Chapter 1: Embracing the Dao (Title of the Section)**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken of—\nRefers to the Dao of classical learning, governance, and moral instruction.\nIs not the eternal Dao.\nIt is not the Dao of natural generation and growth.\nThe eternal Dao should be nurtured through non-action to preserve the spirit, through non-interference to pacify the people, by concealing one’s brilliance, erasing traces, and hiding origins—it cannot be named.\n\nThe name that can be named—\nRefers to wealth, honor, nobility, and fame that surpass the world.\nIs not the eternal name.\nIt is not the name that naturally endures.\nThe eternal name should be like an infant who has not yet spoken, an egg that has not yet divided, a luminous pearl within an oyster, or fine jade embedded in stone—internally radiant, yet outwardly appearing dull and unrefined.\n\nNameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nThe nameless refers to the Dao. The Dao is formless, hence it cannot be named.\n\"Beginning\" means the root of the Dao, which exhales qi and spreads transformation, emerging from emptiness and non-being to become the origin of Heaven and Earth.\n\nNamed, it is the mother of the myriad things.\nThe named refers to Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth possess form and position, yin and yang, softness and hardness—this is why they are named.\n\"Mother of the myriad things\" means Heaven and Earth contain qi to generate the myriad things, nurturing them to maturity, like a mother raising her child.\n\nThus, by constantly being without desire, one may observe its subtleties.\n\"Subtleties\" means essentials. If one can constantly be without desire, one may observe the essentials of the Dao—the essential being the One.\nThe One emerges to bestow names upon the Dao, praising and clarifying right and wrong.\n\nBy constantly having desire, one may observe its manifestations.\n\"Manifestations\" means returns. Those who constantly have desires may observe what worldly customs return to and pursue.\n\nThese two emerge from the same source but have different names.\nThe two refer to having desire and being without desire.\n\"Emerge from the same source\" means they both arise from the human heart.\n\"Different names\" means their designations differ.\nThe name of being without desire endures, while the name of having desire leads to self-destruction.\n\nBoth are called profound.\n\"Profound\" means Heaven. It means those with desires and those without both receive qi from Heaven.\n\nProfound within the profound—\nWithin Heaven, there is yet another Heaven.\nThe endowment of qi varies in thickness; those who obtain harmony and nourishing essence give birth to the worthy and sagely, while those who receive disorder and defilement give birth to the greedy and licentious.\n\nIt is the gate of the myriad subtleties.\nTo enter the Heaven within Heaven, where the endowment of qi varies in thickness, one must eliminate emotions and desires to preserve harmony—this is called the gateway to knowing the essentials of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter 2: Nurturing Life**\n\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nThey exalt their own beauty, making it manifest.\nThis is already ugliness.\nIt leads to danger and ruin.\nWhen all know goodness as goodness,\nIt brings merit and fame.\nThis is already not goodness.\nIt is what people contend over.\n\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other.\nSeeing being, one acts as non-being.\nDifficulty and ease complete each other.\nSeeing difficulty, one acts as ease.\nLong and short define each other.\nSeeing short, one acts as long.\nHigh and low incline toward each other.\nSeeing high, one acts as low.\nSound and voice harmonize with each other.\nThe superior sings, and the inferior must harmonize.\nFront and back follow each other.\nThe superior acts, and the inferior must follow.\n\nTherefore, the sage engages in non-action,\nGoverning through the Dao.\nAnd practices the teaching without words,\nInstructing through personal example.\nThe myriad things arise,\nEach moving on its own,\nYet do not refuse.\nThey do not reject or resist.\nThey are born but do not possess.\nThe primordial qi generates the myriad things but does not possess them.\nThey act but do not rely on it.\nThe Dao enacts its works but does not rely on them, expecting no reward.\nTheir work is accomplished, yet they do not dwell in it.\nWhen tasks are completed and affairs settled, they withdraw and do not occupy their position.\nOnly because they do not dwell in it,\nThus, they do not depart.\nVirtue and fortune remain constant, never leaving their person.\n\nThis means one should not follow what is not practiced, nor know what is not spoken with urgency.\nThe six lines above—high and low, long and short—when the ruler opens one source, a hundred streams arise below. The variations of these hundred streams lead to unrest without end.\n\n**Chapter 3: Pacifying the People**\n\nDo not exalt the worthy—\nThe \"worthy\" refer to the worthy of世俗, those skilled in eloquence and literary refinement, who depart from the Dao to exercise power, abandoning substance for ornament.\n\"Not exalting\" means not valuing them with emoluments or offices.\nSo that the people do not contend.\nThey will not contend for merit and fame, returning to naturalness.\n\nDo not value goods that are hard to obtain—\nThis means the ruler does not indulge in rare treasures, casting gold aside in the mountains and discarding pearls and jade into the depths.\nSo that the people do not become thieves.\nWhen the superior’s transformation is pure and tranquil, there are no greedy people below.\n\nDo not display what is desirable—\nBanish lewd music and keep beautiful people at a distance.\nSo that the people’s hearts are not confused.\nThey will not engage in licentiousness or be led into disorder.\n\nTherefore, in the sage’s governance—\nThis explains that the sage’s governance of the state is the same as self-cultivation.\nEmpty their hearts—\nEliminate cravings and remove chaotic distractions.\nFill their bellies—\nEmbrace the Dao and hold fast to the One, guarding the five spirits.\nWeaken their ambitions—\nBe gentle, yielding, and modest, not occupying positions of power.\nStrengthen their bones—\nCherish essence and value its application, filling the marrow and strengthening the bones.\n\nConstantly cause the people to be without knowledge and without desire.\nReturn to simplicity and preserve purity.\nSo that those with cunning dare not act.\nTheir thoughts are deep, and they do not speak lightly.\nAct through non-action—\nDo not contrive; move in accordance with natural principles.\nThen nothing will be ungoverned.\nVirtue flourishes, and the people are at peace.\n\n**Chapter 4: The Fathomless Source**\n\nThe Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\n\"Empty\" means the center. The Dao conceals its name and hides its reputation; its use lies in the center.\nIt is constantly not full.\n\"Constantly\" means always. The Dao is always humble and never full.\nAbysmal, it seems to be the ancestor of the myriad things.\nThe Dao is profound and unknowable, seemingly the ancestral origin of the myriad things.\n\nBlunt its sharpness—\n\"Sharpness\" means advancement. When people desire to advance their essence to seek merit and fame, they should be restrained, following the Dao’s example of not displaying itself.\nUntangle its knots—\n\"Knots\" mean entangled resentments. One should contemplate the Dao’s non-action to resolve them.\nSoften its brilliance—\n\nHold your wisdom though it be uniquely insightful; know its obscurity, and do not use it to confuse others.\nBlend with the dust.\nDwell among the common folk in shared dust and grime; do not set yourself apart.\nAbiding in stillness, it seems ever-present.\nOne should remain profoundly tranquil, thus enduring without perishing.\n\nI know not whose child it is—\nLaozi says: I know not from whence the Dao arises.\nIt appears before the Lord of Heaven.\nThe Dao exists prior to the celestial sovereign; this speaks of the Dao as preceding the birth of Heaven and Earth.\nTo this day it endures, for it abides in tranquil stillness, untroubled by desires, guiding people to cultivate the body in accordance with the Dao.\n\n**Chapter 5: The Void in Use**\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent—\nHeaven bestows, Earth transforms, yet not through benevolence or grace, but by following nature.\nThey treat the myriad things as straw dogs.\nHeaven and Earth give life to the myriad things, with humans as the most noble, yet they regard them as straw dogs or livestock, seeking no gratitude in return.\n\nThe sage is not benevolent—\nThe sage nurtures and sustains the people, yet not through benevolence or grace, but by emulating Heaven and Earth in following nature.\nHe treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.\nThe sage views the people as straw dogs or livestock, seeking no reverence or gratitude.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nThe space between Heaven and Earth is void, with harmonious qi flowing freely, thus the myriad things arise of themselves.\nIf one can eliminate passions and desires, moderate flavors, and purify the five viscera, then the numinous brightness will reside within.\n\nIt is like a bellows.\nThe bellows is empty within, yet one can produce sound and breath from it.\nVacant yet inexhaustible, moving to yield ever more.\nWhen empty, it never reaches depletion; when set in motion, it produces yet more sound and breath.\n\nMuch speech leads to frequent exhaustion—\nMany affairs harm the spirit; many words harm the body. When the mouth opens and the tongue moves, calamity must follow.\nIt is better to guard the center.\nBetter to preserve virtue within, nurturing the spirit, cherishing qi, and speaking sparingly.\n\n**Chapter 6: The Formless Image**\n\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\n\"Valley\" means nourishment. If one can nourish the spirit, it will not die.\n\"Spirit\" refers to the spirits of the five viscera: the liver stores the *hun*, the lungs store the *po*, the heart stores the *shen*, the kidneys store essence, and the spleen stores the will. If all five viscera are harmed, the five spirits depart.\n\nThis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe undying resides in the Mysterious Female.\n\"Mysterious\" is Heaven; in humans, it is the nose.\n\"Female\" is Earth; in humans, it is the mouth.\nHeaven feeds humans with the five qi, entering through the nose to lodge in the heart. The five qi are subtle and refined, becoming essence, spirit, acuity, brightness, and the five voices.\nIts ghost is called the *hun*; the *hun* is yang, governing entry and exit through the human nose, communicating with Heaven—thus the nose is called \"Mysterious.\"\nEarth feeds humans with the five flavors, entering through the mouth to lodge in the stomach. The five flavors are turbid and coarse, becoming form, bones, flesh, blood, and the six emotions.\nIts ghost is called the *po*; the *po* is yin, governing entry and exit through the human mouth, communicating with Earth—thus the mouth is called \"Female.\"\n\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\"Root\" means origin.\nThe gates of the nose and mouth are where the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth comes and goes.\n\nSubtly enduring, as if present—\nThe breath of nose and mouth should be soft and continuous, seemingly present, yet as if absent.\nUse it without strain.\nWhen using qi, one should be relaxed and unhurried, not urgent or laborious.\n\n**Chapter 7: Concealing Radiance**\n\nHeaven is eternal, Earth enduring—\nThis speaks of Heaven and Earth’s long life and longevity, serving as a lesson for humanity.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can be eternal and enduring is that they do not live for themselves.\nHeaven and Earth alone endure long because they are tranquil, bestowing without seeking reward—unlike humans, who dwell in restless pursuit of self-enrichment, seizing from others to benefit themselves.\n\nThus they are everlasting.\nBecause they do not seek life, they can live long without end.\n\nTherefore the sage places himself last—\nPutting others before oneself.\nYet he comes first.\nThe world reveres him, placing him foremost as elder.\nHe sets himself aside—\nDiminishing himself to magnify others.\nYet he endures.\nThe people love him like parents, and the numinous brightness protects him like a newborn—thus he always endures.\n\nIs it not because he is selfless?\nThe sage is loved by the people and protected by the numinous brightness—is this not because of his impartiality and selflessness?\nThus he fulfills his private [aims].\nWhat people consider private is the desire to enrich themselves. The sage, though selfless, naturally enriches himself—thus he fulfills his private [aims].\n\n**Chapter 8: Transforming Nature**\n\nThe highest virtue is like water.\nThe person of highest virtue is like the nature of water.\nWater benefits the myriad things yet does not contend—\nIn Heaven it becomes mist and dew; on Earth, it becomes springs and streams.\nIt dwells where the multitude abhor—\nThe multitude abhor low, damp, filthy places, yet water alone flows quietly through them.\nThus it is near to the Dao.\nThe nature of water is nearly identical to the Dao.\n\nDwelling in good earth—\nWater naturally delights in the earth, flowing downward over grasses and trees, resembling the female yielding to the male.\nThe heart abides in profound depth—\nWater is deep and empty, its depths clear and bright.\nGiving with benevolent kindness—\nThe myriad things receive life from water.\n\"Giving\" means emptiness, not fullness.\nSpeaking with truthful sincerity—\nWater reflects forms within, never losing its true nature.\nGoverning with upright rectitude—\nThere is nothing it does not wash clean, becoming clear and level.\nHandling affairs with skillful ability—\nIt can be square or round, bending or straight, adapting to form.\nMoving with timely action—\nScattering in summer, congealing in winter, responding to the seasons without missing Heaven’s timing.\n\nIt is only because it does not contend—\nDam it and it stops; release it and it flows, obeying others.\nThus it is without blame.\nSuch is the nature of water—thus the world harbors no resentment toward it.\n\n**Chapter 9: The Turning Axis**\n\nTo hold and fill it is not as good as stopping—\n\"Fill\" means fullness.\n\"Stop\" means cessation.\nHolding fullness must lead to spillage; it is better to cease.\nTo carve and polish it cannot be long preserved—\n\"Carve\" means to refine.\nFirst refine it, but later it must be discarded.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall—none can guard them.\nIndulgence and desire harm the spirit; wealth burdens the body.\nRiches and honor breed arrogance, inviting one’s own misfortune.\nThe rich should relieve the poor; the noble should pity the lowly.\nYet if they turn to arrogance and excess, calamity will surely befall them.\n\nSuccess achieved, fame attained, one retreats—this is the Dao of Heaven.\nWhen one’s deeds are accomplished, affairs established, and reputation flourishes,\nfailing to retreat and withdraw from position invites harm.\nThis is the constant Dao of Heaven.\nAs the sun at its zenith must decline, the moon at full must wane,\nthings at their peak must decline, and joy at its extreme must turn to sorrow.\n\n**Chapter 10: The Power of Capacity**\n\nIn bearing the soul,\n\"Soul\" refers to the hun and po.\nMan carries the hun and po to live—he must cherish and nurture them.\nJoy and anger scatter the hun; sudden fright harms the po.\nThe hun resides in the liver, the po in the lungs.\nFine wine and rich meats corrode the liver and lungs.\nThus, when the hun is tranquil and the mind aligned with the Dao, it remains undisturbed;\nwhen the po is at peace, one attains longevity.\n\nEmbrace the One—can you not let it depart?\nTo embrace the One is to keep it inseparable from the body, ensuring enduring existence.\nThe One is the primordial qi of the Dao’s origin, the essence of Great Harmony.\nThus it is said: The One spreads its name throughout the world.\nHeaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes stable;\nlords and kings attain the One to govern with equity.\nWithin, it is the heart; without, it is conduct.\nDispersed, it becomes virtue—all are named the One.\nThe One signifies an undivided, unwavering will.\n\nConcentrate the qi to attain suppleness—\nGuard the essence-qi without disturbance, so the body may respond with softness.\nCan you be like an infant?\nLike an infant, free from inner thoughts and outer affairs, the spirit does not depart.\n\nPurify the profound mirror—\nWash the heart to keep it pure.\nThe heart dwells in the realm of mystery, perceiving all things—thus it is called the profound mirror.\nCan you be without flaw?\nFree from excess and perversion, pure and without blemish.\n\nIn loving the people and governing the state,\nThose who cultivate the self love their qi to preserve their body;\nthose who govern the state love the people to secure its peace.\nCan you practice non-action?\nIn cultivating the self, regulate breath and essence without letting the ears perceive;\nin governing the state, bestow kindness and virtue without letting the people know.\n\nThe Gate of Heaven opens and closes—\nThe Gate of Heaven refers to the Purple Tenuity Palace at the North Pole.\nOpening and closing signify the cycles of the Five Limits.\nIn cultivating the self, the Gate of Heaven refers to the nostrils:\nopening is inhalation, closing is exhalation.\nCan you act as the female?\nIn cultivating the self, be like the female—calm, still, and yielding.\nIn governing, respond to change, harmonizing without asserting.\n\nIlluminating the Four Directions,\nTo be enlightened and clear, like the sun and moon radiating in all directions,\nfilling the world beyond the Eight Extremes.\nThus it is said: Seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard,\nit pervades the ten directions, resplendent and radiant.\nCan you be without knowledge?\nNone can fully comprehend the Dao that fills the world.\n\nIt gives life and nurtures—\nThe Dao gives life to the myriad things and nourishes them.\nGiving life yet not possessing,\nThe Dao gives life to the myriad things without claiming ownership.\nActing yet not relying,\nThe Dao’s actions do not depend on expectation of reward.\nLeading yet not dominating,\nThe Dao fosters the myriad things without controlling them as tools.\nThis is called profound virtue.\nThe Dao’s virtue is profound and unfathomable, beyond perception—\nit urges man to emulate the Dao.\n\n**Chapter 11: The Use of the Useless**\n\nThirty spokes share a single hub—\nAncient chariots had thirty spokes, corresponding to the lunar cycle.\nThey converge on one hub, where the hollow allows the spokes to unite.\nIn cultivating the self, remove passions and desires to empty the five viscera,\nso the spirit may return.\nIn governing the state, few abilities unite the many weak to create strength.\n\nIt is the void that gives the wheel its use.\nThe void is emptiness.\nThe hub’s emptiness allows the wheel to turn; the carriage’s emptiness allows it to bear its load.\n\nClay is shaped into vessels—\nKnead and blend earth to form vessels for food and drink.\nIt is the void that gives the vessel its use.\nThe vessel’s emptiness allows it to hold.\n\nCarve doors and windows to make a room—\nConstructing a dwelling.\nIt is the void that gives the room its use.\nThe emptiness of doors and windows allows entry and sight;\nthe room’s emptiness allows habitation.\nThus, being provides advantage—\nAdvantage lies in form and function.\nA vessel holds things; a room shelters people.\nOne fears the roof’s collapse, just as the body fears the spirit’s departure.\nEmptiness provides the use.\nEmptiness alone can contain the myriad things—\nthus it is said: the void governs the formed.\nThe Dao is emptiness.\n\n**Chapter 12: Restraining Desires**\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes—\nExcessive lust for beauty harms the essence and dims the eyes.\nThe five tones deafen the ears—\nIndulgence in music scatters harmony from the heart, rendering one deaf to the soundless.\nThe five flavors dull the mouth—\n\"Dull\" means loss.\nCraving the five flavors harms the mouth, causing it to lose the Dao.\nGalloping and hunting madden the heart—\nThe human spirit thrives in stillness.\nGalloping and panting scatter the spirit, inducing madness.\nRare treasures obstruct conduct—\n\"Obstruct\" means harm.\nRare treasures—gold, silver, pearls, jade—\nstir greed and insatiable desire, leading to conduct that harms the body and invites disgrace.\n\nThus the sage attends to the belly—\nPreserves the five natures, discards the six emotions,\ntempers the will and qi, and nurtures the spirit.\nNot to the eyes—\nThe eyes must not gaze recklessly, lest essence leak outward.\nThus he abandons that and embraces this—\nAbandons the reckless gaze of the eyes, embraces the cultivation of the belly’s nature.\n\n**Chapter 13: Disdaining Shame**\n\nFavor and disgrace both bring alarm—\nThe body is alarmed by favor, alarmed by disgrace.\nRegard great trouble as the self.\n\n\"Noble\" means to fear. \"If\" means to arrive. It means great trouble arrives at the body, thus both alarm. What is meant by favor and disgrace? This asks what favor is and what disgrace is. Favor is honor and glory; disgrace is shame and humiliation. The phrase \"arriving at the self and questioning it\" is to enlighten others. Disgrace is lowly—(alternatively, \"favor is high, disgrace is low\")—disgrace is base and vile. To gain them is alarming: gaining favor and glory is alarming, for standing in high position is like treading deep peril. The noble dare not be arrogant; the wealthy dare not be extravagant. To lose them is alarming: losing means falling from favor into disgrace. Alarming means fearing calamity will strike again. This is what is meant by \"favor and disgrace both bring alarm.\" This explains the earlier \"gaining them is alarming, losing them is alarming.\"\n\nWhat is meant by \"regard great trouble as the self\"? Again, questioning: why fear great trouble arriving at the self? The reason I have great trouble is that I have a self. The reason I have great trouble is that I have a self. Having a self brings worry—laboring over hunger and cold, indulging emotions and desires, thus encountering misfortune. If I had no self, what trouble would I have? If I had no body, attaining the Dao naturally, lightly ascending clouds, moving freely without obstruction, communing with the Dao as spirit—what trouble could there be? Thus one who values the self for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world. This means that a ruler who values his own body and belittles others, desiring to be lord of the world, may be temporarily established but cannot endure. One who cherishes the self for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world. This means that a ruler who cherishes his own body not for himself but to be a parent to the myriad people—such a one, becoming lord of the world, may be entrusted with his body above the people, enduring without fault.\n\n**Chapter 14: Praising the Mysterious**\n\nLooked at but unseen, it is called \"even\"—\nWithout color, it is \"even.\" It means the One has no hue and cannot be seen by looking.\nListened to but unheard, it is called \"rare\"—\nWithout sound, it is \"rare.\" It means the One has no tone and cannot be heard by listening.\nGrasped but unattainable, it is called \"subtle\"—\nWithout form, it is \"subtle.\" It means the One has no body and cannot be held by seizing.\n\nThese three cannot be exhaustively questioned—\nThe three refer to \"even,\" \"rare,\" and \"subtle.\" They cannot be exhaustively questioned because, being without color, sound, or form, they cannot be spoken by the mouth, transmitted by writing, but must be received in stillness, sought with spirit, and cannot be obtained by questioning.\n\nThus they merge into the One.\n\"Merge\" means to unite. Thus the three names unite as the One.\n\nAbove, it is not bright—\nIt means the One in the heavens is not bright. \"Bright\" means luminous.\nBelow, it is not dark—\nIt means the One beneath the heavens is not dark. \"Dark\" means obscure and shadowed.\n\nVast and boundless, it cannot be named—\n\"Vast and boundless\" means its movement and action are endless. \"Cannot be named\" means it is not one color—it cannot be distinguished as green, yellow, white, or black; not one sound—it cannot be heard as gong, shang, jue, zhi, or yu; not one form—it cannot be measured as long or short, large or small.\n\nIt returns to nothingness—\n\"Nothingness\" means formlessness. It should return to formlessness.\n\nThis is called the formless form—\nIt means the One has no form yet gives form to the myriad things.\nThe image of no-thing—\nThe One has no substance yet provides images for the myriad things.\nThis is called \"elusive and indistinct\"—\nThe One is elusive and indistinct, now present, now absent, and cannot be seen.\n\nMeet it, yet its head is unseen—\nThe One has no beginning or end and cannot be awaited in advance. Abandon emotions and desires, and the One will return of itself.\nFollow it, yet its rear is unseen—\nThe One leaves no trace and cannot be observed.\n\nHolding fast to the ancient Dao to govern present realities,\nThe sage clings to the ancient Way, generating the One to govern things, knowing that the present must have its One.\nTo know the ancient beginning—this is called the discipline of the Dao.\nOne who knows the original Oneness of the primordial beginning is said to grasp the guiding thread of the Dao.\n\n**Manifesting Virtue (15)**\nThe ancients skilled in being noble ones—\nThey were rulers who had attained the Dao.\nSubtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating,\n\"Profound\" means Heaven. Their aspirations were subtle and wondrous, their essence communing with Heaven.\nDeep beyond all knowing.\nTheir virtue and power were deep and far-reaching, unknowable and unfathomable. Inwardly, they saw as if blind; in reflection, they heard as if deaf—none could discern their excellence.\nOnly because they were unknowable were they forced to describe them thus:\nHesitant, as if crossing a river in winter;\nIn all undertakings, they acted with utmost caution. Hesitant, as if crossing a river in winter—such was the difficulty in their hearts.\nCautious, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;\nIn advance and retreat, they were restrained, as if bound, like one who has broken the law, fearing that neighbors might discover it.\nRespectful, as if a guest;\nLike a guest before a host, solemn and without pretense.\nDissolving, like ice about to melt,\n\"Dissolving\" means dispersing. \"Melting\" means vanishing. Abandoning emotions and desires, they grew daily more empty.\nSincere, like uncarved wood,\n\"Sincere\" means thick and substantial. \"Uncarved wood\" means form undivided. Within, they guarded their essence and spirit; without, they bore no ornamentation.\nVast, like a valley;\n\"Vast\" means broad and expansive. \"Valley\" means empty and hollow. Without merit, fame, or achievement, they embraced all things.\nTurbid, like muddy water.\n\"Turbid\" means guarding the original truth. \"Muddy\" means not clear and bright. They merged with the multitude, not asserting themselves.\nWho can make the turbid still and gradually clear?\nWho knows how to still the turbid water so that it slowly clears of itself?\nWho can remain at rest and gradually quicken into life?\nWho can remain tranquil for long and slowly bring forth life?\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\nThose who preserve this Way of gradual life do not seek excess or overflow.\nOnly because they are not full can they remain concealed and not newly accomplished.\nOnly those who are not full can guard what is hidden and not pursue new achievements.\n\"Concealed\" means hiding one’s brilliance. \"Newly accomplished\" means prizing merit and fame.\n\n**Returning to the Root (16)**\nAttain utmost emptiness,\nThose who attain the Dao cast off emotions and desires, purifying the five viscera to reach utmost emptiness.\nGuard stillness with sincerity.\nGuard clarity and stillness, acting with sincerity and depth.\nThe myriad things arise together,\n\"Arise\" means to be born. The myriad things are born together.\nAnd I thereby observe their return.\nI observe that all things without exception return to their root. One should reflect deeply on this root.\nNow, things flourish abundantly,\n\"Flourish abundantly\" means leaves and blossoms in full bloom.\nYet each returns to its root.\nAll things without exception wither and fall, each returning to its root to be born anew.\nReturning to the root is called stillness.\n\"Stillness\" refers to the root. The root is tranquil, soft, and weak, humble and lowly—thus it does not die again.\nThis is called returning to life.\nTo be tranquil is to return to one’s nature and life, rendering death impossible.\nReturning to life is called constancy.\nTo return to life and escape death is the constant practice of the Dao.\nTo know constancy is called illumination;\nTo know the constant practice of the Dao is to be enlightened.\nNot knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.\nNot knowing the constant practice of the Dao, reckless and cunning actions lose the spirit’s clarity—hence misfortune.\nKnowing constancy, one embraces all;\nTo know the constant practice of the Dao is to cast off emotions and forget desires, embracing all things without exception.\nEmbracing all, one is impartial;\nTo embrace all things is to be just and selfless, with no evil able to withstand it.\nImpartial, one is kingly;\nTo be just and selfless is to be fit to rule the world. Governing the body rightly unifies its form; a thousand spirits and ten thousand numina converge in one’s person.\nKingly, one is heavenly;\nTo be kingly is to have virtue harmonize with the numinous—thus one communes with Heaven.\nHeavenly, one is of the Dao;\nTo commune with Heaven is to unite with the Dao.\nOf the Dao, one endures long.\nUnited with the Dao, one attains longevity.\nEven in death, one is not imperiled.\nTo be impartial and kingly, to commune with Heaven and unite with the Dao—possessing these four in purity, with virtue vast and far-reaching, free from calamity and blame, one perishes with Heaven and Earth, never imperiled.\n\n**Pure Wind (17)**\nIn the highest antiquity, those below knew only that it existed.\n\"Highest antiquity\" refers to the nameless rulers of primordial times. \"Those below knew only that it existed\" means the people knew their ruler existed but did not serve as subjects—such was their simplicity.\nNext, they drew near and praised him.\nHis virtue was manifest, his kindness and favor worthy of praise—thus they cherished and extolled him.\nNext, they feared him.\nHe established laws and punishments to govern them.\nNext, they scorned him.\nProhibitions multiplied and commands grew burdensome, making sincerity impossible—thus they deceived and scorned him.\nWhen trust is insufficient, there is distrust.\nWhen the ruler’s trust in the people is insufficient, the people respond with distrust, deceiving their ruler.\nHow cautiously they valued their words!\nSpeaking of the rulers of highest antiquity, they acted with caution, prizing their words, fearing to depart from the Dao and lose their spontaneity.\nTheir tasks were accomplished, their affairs completed,\nThis means the world was at great peace.\nYet the common people all said, \"We are naturally so.\"\nThe common people, not knowing the ruler’s virtue was profound and thick, instead believed they were naturally so.\n\n**The Decline of Custom (18)**\nWhen the great Dao is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness.\nIn the age of the great Dao, every household had its filial child, every door its loyal and trustworthy member—benevolence and righteousness were unseen. When the great Dao is abandoned and unused, evil and rebellion arise, and only then are benevolence and righteousness transmitted.\nWhen wisdom and cunning emerge, there is great deception.\nWhen rulers value words over virtue and ornament over substance, those below respond with great deception and treachery.\nWhen the six relations are not at peace, there is filial piety and kindness.\nWhen the six bonds are severed and kin do not harmonize, only then do filial piety and kindness nurture one another.\nWhen the state is benighted and chaotic, there are loyal ministers.\nWhen decrees are unclear, superiors and inferiors resent one another, and the perverse contend for power, only then do loyal ministers correct their rulers.\n\nWhen the world is at great peace, none know benevolence; when all people are without desire, none know integrity; when each purifies themselves, none know chastity. In the age of the great Dao, benevolence and righteousness vanish, filial piety and kindness fade—like the sun at its zenith, radiant and bright, while the host of stars lose their light.\n\n**Returning to Simplicity, Nineteenth**\n**Abandoning Sagacity**\nAbandon the sagacity of inventions; return to the origin and guard the primordial. The Five Emperors hung their symbols, Cang Jie created writing—yet these are not equal to the knotted cords of the Three Sovereigns, which bore no ornament. Abandon wisdom, abandon cleverness, and return to non-action. The people’s benefit increases a hundredfold. Farming prospers, and the public knows no private gain.\n\n**Abandoning Benevolence and Righteousness**\nAbandon the display of benevolence and the esteem for fine words. The people return to filial piety and kindness—virtue transforms them, making them pure.\n\n**Abandoning Cunning and Profit**\nAbandon cunning, for it is deception that confounds truth. Abandon profit, for it blocks the path of greed and shuts the gates of power. Then thieves and bandits will cease to exist. Above, transformation is impartial; below, there is no perverse self-interest.\n\nThese three—referring to the three things abandoned above—are deemed insufficient as cultural refinements. For cultural refinements are insufficient to teach the people, thus they must be given something to belong to, as in the lines below:\n\n**Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity**\nTo \"manifest plainness\" is to hold fast to the unadorned and guard the true, not esteeming embellishment. To \"embrace simplicity\" is to hold to one’s unvarnished nature, displaying it to those below so they may take it as a model.\n\n**Lessen self-interest, reduce desires**\nTo \"lessen self-interest\" is to rectify and eliminate private concerns. To \"reduce desires\" is to know contentment.\n\n**Different Customs, Twentieth**\n**Abandoning Learning**\n\nTo abandon learning is not true; it does not accord with the Dao’s pattern. Without care. By removing superficial adornments, there is no care or calamity. \"Yea\" and \"nay\"—how far apart are they? Both are responses, yet how far do they diverge? The age exalts embellishment and devalues substance. Good and evil—how far apart are they? Good elicits praise, evil invites remonstrance; how far do they truly diverge? The age detests loyalty and uprightness, employing the devious and obsequious.\n\nWhat people fear, one cannot but fear. \"People\" refers to followers of the Dao. What people fear is the ruler who does not abandon learning. One cannot but fear this, for it brings flattery near and slays the humane and worthy. How vast and boundless it is! The world’s customs are chaotic, desiring to advance learning for embellishment, never ceasing.\n\nThe multitude, radiant and gleeful—gleeful, indulging in excess and many desires—like one feasting on a grand sacrifice, like a starving man craving the full spread, never sated. Like ascending a terrace in spring—spring, when yin and yang commingle, and the myriad things stir; gazing from the terrace, the will drifts in surfeit.\n\nI alone am cautious, without sign—cautious and tranquil, without the form or omen of desire. Like an infant who has not yet learned to smile. Adrift, as if with nowhere to return. The multitude all have more than enough—surplus wealth for extravagance, surplus cunning for deceit. Yet I alone seem forsaken, as though lacking.\n\nAh, the heart of a fool is mine! Not following the common crowd, holding fast to the One without wavering, like the heart of a fool. Murky, murky—without distinction. The common folk are bright and clear—lucid and penetrating. I alone seem dim, like one benighted. The common folk are keen and sharp—keen and swift. I alone am dull and vague, without division or severance.\n\nSwift as the sea—I alone am swift, like the flowing river or sea, its limits unknown. Drifting, as if without end—I alone drift, now soaring, now rising, without cessation, my aspiration dwelling in the realm of spirit. The multitude all have their means—means, that is, their doings.\n\nAnd I alone am stubborn—I alone practice non-action, seeming coarse. Coarse, as though inadequate.\n\nI alone differ from others—I alone diverge from the common. Yet I honor the nourishment of the Mother. Nourishment, that is, application. Mother, that is, the Dao. I alone honor the application of the Dao.\n\n**Emptying the Heart (Chapter 21)**\nThe bearing of great virtue—\nGreat, that is, vast. The person of great virtue embraces all without exception, receives the impure and turbid, and dwells in humility.\n\nOnly the Dao is followed.\nOnly, that is, solely. The person of great virtue does not follow the ways of the common world but adheres solely to the Dao.\n\nAs for the Dao as a thing, it is only fleeting, only elusive.\nThe Dao in relation to the ten thousand things is uniquely fleeting and elusive in its comings and goings, without fixed abode.\n\nElusive, fleeting—within it there are images.\nThe Dao is only elusive and formless, yet within it lie the patterns of the ten thousand things.\n\nFleeting, elusive—within it there is something.\nThe Dao is only fleeting and elusive, yet within it there is the One, managing and engendering transformation, establishing substance through qi.\n\nProfound, obscure—within it there is essence.\nThe Dao is only profound and obscure, formless, yet within it lies true essence, where spirit and brightness intermingle, and yin and yang converge.\n\nIts essence is utterly real.\nThe Dao’s essential qi is wondrously real, without adornment.\n\nWithin it there is sincerity.\nThe Dao conceals its merit and hides its name, yet its sincerity resides within.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, its name does not depart.\nFrom, that is, since. From ancient times to the present, the Dao remains constant, never departing.\n\nBy this, the multitude of beginnings is beheld.\nBeheld, that is, endowed. Beginnings, that is, origins. The Dao endows and initiates the birth of the ten thousand things, which receive qi from the Dao.\n\nHow do I know the thusness of the multitude of beginnings?\nHow do I know that the ten thousand things receive qi from the Dao?\n\nBy this.\nThis, that is, the present. By observing that all things today receive the Dao’s essential qi to live, move, act, and dwell—nothing exists without the Dao.\n\n**Increasing Humility (Chapter 22)**\nTo yield is to be preserved whole.\nTo yield oneself and follow others, not acting on one’s own, is to preserve the body.\n\nTo bend is to be made straight.\nTo bend is to humble oneself and elevate others; in time, one naturally becomes straight.\n\nTo be hollow is to be filled.\nThe earth is hollow and low, so water flows to it; a person is humble and low, so virtue gathers in them.\n\nTo be worn is to be renewed.\nTo accept wear and thinness, putting others first and oneself last, the world will respect them, and in time, they will be renewed.\n\nTo have little is to gain.\nTo accept little for oneself is to gain much, for the Dao of Heaven aids the humble, and spirit brightness abides in emptiness.\n\nTo have much is to be perplexed.\nThose with abundant wealth are perplexed by what they guard; those with abundant learning are perplexed by what they hear.\n\nThus the sage embraces the One as a model for the world.\nEmbraces, that is, holds fast. Model, that is, standard. The sage holds fast to the One and thereby comprehends all affairs, serving as a model for the world.\n\nNot seeing on one’s own, therefore clear.\nThe sage does not use their own eyes to see beyond a thousand li but relies on the eyes of the world to see, thus achieving clarity and penetration.\n\nNot asserting oneself, therefore distinguished.\nThe sage does not insist on their own rightness and reject others, thus becoming distinguished in the world.\n\nNot boasting, therefore meritorious.\nBoasting, that is, claiming. The sage’s virtue flows and transforms without claiming its beauty, thus achieving merit for the world.\n\nNot exalting oneself, therefore enduring.\nExalting, that is, magnifying. The sage does not elevate themselves, thus enduring without peril.\n\nIt is only because they do not contend that the world cannot contend with them.\nThis means that none in the world, whether worthy or unworthy, can contend with one who does not contend.\n\nThe ancient saying, “To yield is to be preserved whole,” is no empty word.\nThe transmitted ancient words—yielding and following preserves the body—are not false.\n\nTruly whole, they return to it.\nTruly, that is, in reality. One who can practice yielding and following truly preserves their body, returning it to their parents unharmed.\n\n**Emptiness and Non-Being (Chapter 23)**\nSparse words accord with nature.\n\nSparse words mean cherishing speech. To cherish speech is the Dao of nature. Thus, whirlwinds do not last the morning, nor do sudden rains last the day. Whirlwinds are swift winds; sudden rains are violent rains. This means swiftness cannot endure, nor can violence last long. Who brings these about? Heaven and Earth. Who—meaning, who—creates these whirlwinds and violent rains? They are the work of Heaven and Earth. Yet even Heaven and Earth cannot make them last, cannot extend them from dawn to dusk. How much less can humans do so? Though Heaven and Earth, most numinous, combine to form whirlwinds and violent rains, they still cannot make them endure from morning to evening—how much less should humans desire to act with sudden violence?\n\nTherefore, those who engage in the Dao—\n*Engage* means *to act*. When humans act, they should be as still as the Dao, not like whirlwinds or sudden rains—\nthose of the Dao are one with the Dao.\n*Those of the Dao* refers to those who love the Dao. *One with the Dao* means to be in harmony with the Dao.\nThose of virtue are one with virtue.\n*Those of virtue* refers to those who love virtue. *One with virtue* means to be in harmony with virtue.\nThose of loss are one with loss.\n*Loss* means to rely on oneself and lose others. *One with loss* means to be in harmony with loss.\n\nThose one with the Dao—the Dao, too, delights in attaining them.\nThose in harmony with the Dao—the Dao, too, delights in attaining them.\nThose one with virtue—virtue, too, delights in attaining them.\nThose in harmony with virtue—virtue, too, delights in attaining them.\nThose one with loss—loss, too, delights in attaining them.\nThose in harmony with loss—loss, too, delights in attaining them.\n\nWhen trust is insufficient—\nWhen the ruler’s trust in those below is insufficient, those below respond to the ruler with distrust—\nthere is distrust.\nThis speaks of how things of a kind gather together, how sounds of the same tone resonate, how qi of the same nature seek one another. Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger, water flows toward the damp, fire moves toward the dry—these are the natural categories.\n\n**Forced Favor (Chapter 24)**\nThose who stand on tiptoe do not stand firm;\n\n\"To stand on tiptoe\" means to advance. It refers to those who covet power and fame, who seek achievement and glory—such people cannot long stand firm in body or walk the Way.\n\n\"Those who stride do not walk\"—\nThose who consider themselves noble and stride above others will be collectively obstructed by the people, preventing them from moving forward.\n\n\"Those who display themselves are not enlightened\"—\nPeople who display their own appearance as fine, who regard their own conduct as conforming to the Way, do not realize how ugly their form is, how base their conduct.\n\n\"Those who are self-righteous are not illustrious\"—\nThose who consider themselves right and others wrong will be collectively obstructed by the people, preventing their brilliance from shining forth.\n\n\"Those who boast of themselves achieve no merit\"—\nThose who constantly boast and claim merit for themselves lose the merit they might have gained from others.\n\n\"Those who are self-conceited do not endure\"—\nThose who are fond of self-aggrandizement cannot long endure.\n\nIn relation to the Way, these are called \"leftover food and parasitic conduct.\"\n\"Parasitic\" means greedy. If such self-aggrandizing and boastful people were in the Way of governing a state, they would daily levy taxes to amass surplus provisions, engaging in greedy conduct.\n\nAll things may detest them—\nWhen such people hold office, their every action seeks to harm, so there is nothing that does not fear and detest them.\n\nThus, those who possess the Way do not remain.\nThis means that those who possess the Way do not dwell in such a state.\n\n**Image of the Origin (Chapter 25)**\nThere is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth.\nIt refers to the formless Dao, which in its undifferentiated state gives rise to the myriad things, existing before heaven and earth.\n\nSilent and empty, it stands alone and does not change—\n\"Silent\" means without sound. \"Empty\" means without form. \"Stands alone\" means without peer. \"Does not change\" means its transformations are constant.\n\nIt travels everywhere without exhaustion—\nThe Dao circulates through heaven and earth, penetrating all things. In the yang it does not scorch, in the yin it does not rot. It passes through all without peril or weariness.\n\nIt may be called the Mother of all under heaven—\nThe Dao nurtures the essential qi of the myriad things, like a mother nurturing her child.\n\nI do not know its name; I style it \"Dao\"—\nI do not see the Dao’s form, nor know how to name it. Seeing that all things arise from the Dao, I style it \"Dao.\"\n\nForcing a name upon it, I call it \"Great\"—\nNot knowing its name, I forcefully call it \"Great,\" for it is lofty without superior, all-encompassing without boundary, embracing all things—thus I call it \"Great.\"\n\n\"Great\" means \"it goes\"—\nIts greatness is not like heaven, which is always above, nor like earth, which is always below. Rather, it departs, having no fixed abode.\n\n\"It goes\" means \"it is distant\"—\n\"Distant\" means it reaches the limitless, spreading its qi through heaven and earth, penetrating all without obstruction.\n\n\"Distant\" means \"it returns\"—\nThough distant, it does not sever its connection, but returns to dwell within the human body.\n\nThus, the Dao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and the king (or \"the human\") is also great—\nThe Dao is great because it encompasses heaven and earth, containing all things. Heaven is great because it covers all without exception. Earth is great because it bears all without exception. The king is great because he governs all without exception.\n\nWithin the realm, there are four great things—\nThe four great things are the Dao, heaven, earth, and the king.\n\nYet any designation or name falls short of its ultimate reality—\nTo speak of the Dao is to speak of what it arises from; having arisen, it is then called the Dao. Yet this \"greatness\" within names is not as great as namelessness. The nameless cannot be captured by names—this is the realm.\n\nHeaven, earth, and the king all reside within this nameless realm. Thus it is said, \"Within the realm, there are four great things.\"\n\nAnd the king occupies one of them—\nWithin the eight directions, there are four great things, and the king occupies one of them.\n\nHumans model themselves on earth—\nHumans should model themselves on earth’s tranquility and gentle harmony. Planting yields the five grains; digging yields sweet springs. It labors without complaint, achieves without claiming credit.\n\nEarth models itself on heaven—\nHeaven is serene and unmoving, bestowing without seeking repayment, nurturing the myriad things without taking possession.\n\nHeaven models itself on the Dao—\nThe Dao is clear and still, silently circulating its essential qi, allowing the myriad things to form of themselves.\n\nThe Dao models itself on the natural—\nThe nature of the Dao is spontaneous, without anything it models itself upon.\n\n**Valuing Power (Chapter 26)**\nHeaviness is the root of lightness—\nIf a ruler is not heavy, he will not be revered. If one does not value heaviness in cultivating the self, one loses one’s spirit. The flowers and leaves of plants are light, so they wither and fall; their roots are heavy, so they endure.\n\nStillness is the lord of restlessness—\nIf a ruler is not still, he loses his authority. If one does not value stillness in cultivating the self, one’s life is imperiled. The dragon is still, so it can transform; the tiger is restless, so it suffers early loss.\n\nThus, the sage travels all day yet does not depart from the heavy and still—\n\"Still\" refers to tranquility. The sage travels the Way all day yet does not depart from stillness and heaviness.\n\nThough there be splendid sights, he dwells in them with transcendent ease—\n\"Splendid sights\" refer to palaces and towers. \"Dwells in them\" refers to the residences of consorts and concubines. \"Transcendent ease\" means keeping a distance and not residing in them.\n\nHow could the lord of ten thousand chariots—\n\"How could\" is an expression of lament for the rulers of the age. The \"lord of ten thousand chariots\" refers to the king.\n\nTreat his person as light beneath all under heaven?\nThe king is most revered, yet how could he conduct himself with frivolity and restlessness? This laments how the rulers of the age indulge in extravagance and reckless dissipation.\n\nLightness loses the ministers—\nIf a ruler is frivolous and dissolute, he loses his ministers. If one is frivolous and dissolute in cultivating the self, one loses one’s essence.\n\nRestlessness loses the lord—\nIf a ruler acts with haste and impatience, he loses his throne. If one is hasty and impatient in cultivating the self, one loses one’s spirit.\n\n**Skillful Application (Chapter 27)**\n\"In good traveling, there are no wheel tracks—\"\n\nOne who skillfully practices the Dao seeks it within the self, never descending the hall nor stepping beyond the gate—thus leaving no wheel tracks. Skillful speech bears no flaw or blame, for one who chooses words with care speaks without blemish or fault under heaven. Skillful calculation requires no counting rods, for one who reckons affairs by the Dao abides in unity without deviation; when calculations are few, they may be known without counting rods. Skillful closure needs no bolt or bar, yet cannot be opened, for one who seals desires and guards the spirit by the Dao does not rely on doors or bolts that may be undone. Skillful binding uses no cords or knots, yet cannot be untied, for one who binds affairs by the Dao binds the heart in such a way that no cord may loose it.\n\nThus the sage constantly excels at saving people—by teaching loyalty and filial piety, desiring to preserve their nature and lives—so that none are cast aside, and noble and base each find their place. The sage constantly excels at saving things—by teaching the people to follow the four seasons, desiring to preserve all things from harm—so that nothing is cast aside. The sage does not despise the worthless nor prize jade, regarding them as one. This is called \"inheriting the light.\" The sage’s skill in saving people and things is called inheriting the luminous Dao.\n\nTherefore, the good serve as teachers to the not-good; those who practice goodness are taken by the sage as models for others. The not-good serve as resources for the good, for even those who act without goodness are taught and guided by the sage to become useful. If one does not value one’s teacher, one lacks support; if one does not cherish one’s resources, one has nothing to employ. Though one may deem oneself wise, this is great delusion. This is called the essential mystery.\n\n**Returning to Simplicity (Chapter 28)**\nKnow the masculine, yet guard the feminine, and become the valley of the world. The masculine symbolizes honor; the feminine, humility. Though one may know one’s own honor and distinction, one should still guard humility, abandoning the strength of the masculine for the softness of the feminine. Thus the world turns to one as water flows into a deep valley. As the valley of the world, one’s constant virtue never departs, and one returns to the state of an infant—clumsy and without knowledge.\n\nKnow the bright, yet guard the dark, and become the model for the world. The bright symbolizes clarity; the dark, obscurity. Though one may know one’s own clarity, one should still guard obscurity, as if dim and seeing nothing. Thus one may become the model for the world, and one’s constant virtue remains unerring. As the model for the world, one’s constant virtue never falters, and one returns to the boundless. When virtue never falters, life endures and returns to the infinite.\n\nKnow glory, yet guard disgrace, and become the valley of the world. Glory symbolizes honor; disgrace, defilement. One who knows one’s own glory should still guard defilement. Thus the world turns to one as water flows into a deep valley. As the valley of the world, one’s constant virtue is fulfilled—for \"fulfilled\" means \"settled.\" One who becomes the valley of the world finds virtue ever settled within. One returns to simplicity. When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels; vessels are for use. When the simplicity of the myriad things scatters, it becomes implements. When the Dao scatters, it becomes spirit and illumination, flowing as the sun and moon, dividing into the five phases. When the sage employs it, it becomes the leader of officials. Thus great governance does not sever. When the sage employs it, the great Dao governs the world without harm, and in cultivating the self, it governs desires without injuring the spirit.\n\n**Non-Action (Chapter 29)**\nThose who would take the world and act upon it—I see they will not succeed. The world is a sacred vessel; it cannot be acted upon (or: cannot be grasped). Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it.\n\nThus things may go ahead or follow behind, may exhale warmly or blow cold, may be strong or weak, may be secure or imperiled. Therefore the sage discards excess, extravagance, and extravagance. By abandoning these three, dwelling in harmony, and practicing non-action, the world transforms of itself.\n\n**Frugality and Restraint in Warfare (Chapter 30)**\nOne who assists a ruler with the Dao does not use arms to strengthen the world. Such affairs tend to rebound. Where armies camp, brambles grow. When war passes, farmland lies abandoned, fields go untended.\n\n**After Great Armies (Continuation of Chapter 30)**\nIn the wake of great armies, there must be years of famine. Heaven responds with malign qi, harming the five grains and injuring all people. The good warrior achieves results and stops—merely resolute, not glorying in it. He does not dare seize strength through force. He is resolute but not boastful, resolute but not vaunting, resolute but not arrogant. Resolute action arises only from necessity, not coercion. Resolute but not overbearing. All things, when they reach their prime, begin to age—grass and trees flourish to their peak, then wither and fall; men grow strong to their height, then decline. To say that strength can endure is called \"not the Dao.\" Withering and aging come from failing to follow the Dao. Those who do not follow the Dao perish early.\n\n**Against Arms (Chapter 31)**\nFine weaponry is an instrument of ill omen. \"Fine\" means adornment; \"omen\" means good. Arms disturb the spirit and muddy harmonious qi—an implement not good for men, not to be embellished. All things may despise it, for when arms move, they bring harm. Thus one who embodies the Dao does not dwell in such a state.\n\nThe noble person at rest values the left; in warfare, he values the right. This shows that the way of arms is the opposite of the noble person’s way, and what they value differs. Arms are instruments of ill omen, implements of harm. They are not the noble person’s instruments, not what he esteems. Only when unavoidable does he employ them—when facing decline, disorder, or calamity, wishing to shield the myriad people, he uses them to defend himself. Serenity is supreme. He does not covet lands or profit from others’ wealth. Though victorious, he does not celebrate it, for to celebrate victory is to delight in killing. One who delights in killing cannot fulfill his will in the world. A ruler who takes pleasure in killing cannot be entrusted with dominion over all under heaven, for as a lord of men, he would wield power over life and death, wantonly meting out punishments and executions.\n\nIn auspicious affairs, the left is honored; in inauspicious affairs, the right. The deputy general stands on the left, the supreme general on the right. The deputy general, though humble, occupies the yang position because he does not hold sole authority over killing. The supreme general, though exalted, occupies the yin position because he alone commands slaughter. This is to treat it as mourning rites. The supreme general stands on the right, for mourning rites honor the right, and the dead are valued in yin. When the slain are many, mourn them with sorrow and tears, for one’s virtue is too meager to transform others through the Dao, and the harm falls upon the innocent. When victorious, observe it with mourning rites. In ancient times, after victory, the general took the position of the chief mourner, wearing plain robes and weeping—showing that the noble person values virtue and disdains arms, that he does not rejoice in punishing the inauspicious, that his heart finds no joy in it, likening it to mourning. He grieves for the unending wars of later generations.\n\n**The Unnamable Virtue (Chapter 32)**\nThe Dao is eternally nameless.\n\nThe Dao can be yin, can be yang,\ncan relax, can tense,\ncan endure, can perish—\nthus it has no constant name.\nThough the uncarved block is small,\nnone under heaven can make it a subject.\nThough the Dao’s simplicity is small,\nsubtle and formless,\nnone under heaven dare employ it as a servant.\n\nShould lords and kings hold fast to it,\nthe myriad things will of themselves submit.\nShould lords and kings guard the Dao and practice non-action,\nthe myriad things will of themselves submit,\nyielding to its virtue.\n\nHeaven and earth unite,\nand sweet dew descends—\nwhen the actions of lords and kings accord with heaven,\nheaven bestows sweet dew and auspicious omens.\nThe people, without command, of themselves find balance.\nWhen heaven sends down sweet dew and auspicious omens,\nthe myriad things, without instruction,\nall attain harmony as one.\n\nIn the beginning, there is naming:\nThe beginning is the Dao.\nThe named are the myriad things.\nThe nameless Dao governs the named,\nthe formless governs the formed.\n\nOnce names exist,\nall things, having desires,\nrebel against the Dao and depart from virtue,\nthus bringing ruin and disgrace upon themselves.\nYet if one models oneself on the Dao and practices virtue,\nheaven will of itself acknowledge it.\nWhen heaven acknowledges it,\nspirits protect and assist,\nand danger and decay are no more.\n\nThe Dao’s presence in the world\nis like valleys and streams flowing into rivers and seas.\nThey respond to one another as naturally as watercourses merge.\n\n**Distinguishing Virtue (Chapter 33)**\nTo know others is wisdom—\nto discern their likes and dislikes is wisdom.\nTo know oneself is clarity—\nto recognize one’s worth or unworthiness\nis to listen without sound, to see without form,\nthus it is clarity.\n\nTo overcome others is to have force—\nto do so is no more than to rely on power.\nTo overcome oneself is strength—\nto conquer one’s own desires,\nnone under heaven can contend with such a one,\nthus it is strength.\n\nTo know contentment is wealth—\nto know contentment is to preserve blessings and prosperity,\nthus it is wealth.\nTo act with perseverance is to have resolve—\nto strive diligently in goodness\nis to set one’s will upon the Dao,\nand the Dao sets its will upon such a one.\n\nTo not lose one’s place is to endure—\nto nurture oneself and not lose\nthe celestial qi one has received\nis to attain longevity.\nTo die yet not perish is to live long—\nto not let the eyes wander in vain,\nthe ears listen in vain,\nthe mouth speak in vain,\nis to incur no resentment under heaven,\nthus to live long.\n\n**Assuming Completion (Chapter 34)**\nVast flows the great Dao—\n\nVast flows the great Dao—\nebbing and surging, now floating, now sinking,\nnow present, now absent,\nseen yet unseen,\nspoken yet hard to distinguish.\nIt may turn left or right,\nfor the Dao may go left or right,\nnowhere is it unfit.\nThe ten thousand things rely upon it to live—\n*rely*: to depend upon.\nAll things depend upon the Dao to live,\nyet it does not refuse them,\nfor the Dao does not reject or hinder.\nIts work complete, it claims no possession—\nwith the Dao, one does not claim merit for its achievements.\nIt nurtures and sustains the ten thousand things yet does not rule over them,\nthough the Dao loves and nourishes all things, it is not like a lord who takes possession.\nEver without desire, it may be called small—\nthe Dao conceals its power and hides its name,\nserene and without action, it seems as if faint and small.\nThe ten thousand things return to it yet it does not rule over them—\nall things return to the Dao to receive qi,\nyet the Dao is not like a lord who imposes restrictions.\nThus it may be called great—\nthe ten thousand things come and go freely,\nallowing names to arise naturally, so it may be called great.\nTherefore the sage never acts as though great,\nfor the sage models the Dao, concealing power and hiding names, never claiming fullness or greatness.\nThus they are able to perfect their greatness—\nthe sage guides by personal example, transforming without words,\nall affairs ordered and cultivated, thus able to perfect their greatness.\n\n**Virtue of Humaneness (Chapter 35)**\nHold fast to the great image, and all under heaven will come.\n*Hold fast*: to uphold.\n*Image*: the Dao.\nWhen the sage upholds the great Dao,\nthe hearts of the ten thousand people turn and return to them.\nIn cultivating the self, celestial spirits and luminous beings descend,\ncoming and going within.\nThey come yet do no harm, bringing peace, tranquility, and great harmony—\nwhen the ten thousand people return without injury,\nthe state attains peace and great harmony.\nIn cultivating the self without harming the spirits,\nthe body attains peace and great longevity.\nMusic and delicacies make the passing traveler pause—\n*delicacies*: fine foods.\n*passing traveler*: the One.\nWhen one delights in the Dao’s excellence,\nthe One lingers.\nThe One departs from fullness and dwells in emptiness,\nfleeting like a passing traveler.\nThe Dao that issues from the mouth is bland, without flavor—\nthe Dao enters and leaves the mouth,\nso subtle it is unlike the five flavors of sour, salty, bitter, sweet, or pungent.\nGazing upon it, one cannot see enough—\n*enough*: to attain.\nThe Dao is formless,\nunlike the five colors of blue, yellow, red, white, or black that can be seen.\nListening to it, one cannot hear enough—\nthe Dao is unlike the five notes of gong, shang, jue, zhi, or yu that can be heard.\nUsing it, one cannot exhaust it—\n*exhaust*: to deplete.\n\nGoverning the state with the Dao brings peace and prosperity to the people. Cultivating the self with it extends life and longevity, without ever reaching an end.\n\n**Chapter 36: Subtle Illumination**\nTo gather, one must first expand.\nThe prior expansion aims to exhaust excess and indulgence.\nTo weaken, one must first strengthen.\nThe prior strengthening aims to invite misfortune.\nTo abolish, one must first elevate.\nThe prior elevation aims to foster arrogance and peril.\nTo seize, one must first give.\nThe prior giving aims to satiate greed.\nThis is called subtle illumination.\nThese four matters—subtle in method, yet manifest in effect.\n\nThe soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.\nThe soft and weak endure, while the hard and strong perish first.\nFish must not leave the depths—\nif a fish leaves the depths, it abandons hardness for softness and can no longer be controlled.\nA state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others.\n*Sharp instruments*: the arts of power and strategy.\nThe strategies of statecraft must not be revealed to ministers in office.\nThe Dao of self-cultivation must not be shown to those unworthy of it.\n\n**Chapter 37: On Governance**\nThe Dao is ever non-action, yet nothing is left undone.\nThe Dao’s constancy lies in non-action.\nIf lords and kings can hold to it, the myriad things will transform of themselves.\nIf lords and kings abide by the Dao, the myriad things will naturally emulate them.\nShould transformation give rise to desire, I will suppress it with the nameless uncarved block.\n*I*: the self.\n*The nameless uncarved block*: the Dao and its virtue.\nWhen the myriad things have emulated the self and yet desire to act with cunning and deceit, lords and kings must personally suppress and pacify them with the Dao and its virtue.\nThe nameless uncarved block is also free of desire.\nWithout desire, there is stillness—\nif lords and kings pacify with the Dao and its virtue, the people too will be free of desire, and thus should be guided with clarity and stillness.\nThe world will then stabilize itself.\nThose who can do this will bring the world to natural order and stability.\n\n**Chapter 38: On Virtue**\nThe highest virtue does not act as virtue—\n*highest virtue*: the rulers of remote antiquity without titles or names, whose virtue was supreme, hence called \"highest virtue.\"\n*Does not act as virtue*: they did not govern the people through virtuous teachings but followed nature, nurturing the people’s nature and life. Their virtue was unseen, hence called \"does not act as virtue.\"\nThus they possess virtue.\nTheir virtue aligns with heaven and earth, harmonious qi flows freely, and the people’s virtue remains whole.\nLesser virtue does not lose virtue—\n*lesser virtue*: rulers with posthumous titles, whose virtue does not match the highest, hence called \"lesser virtue.\"\n*Does not lose virtue*: their virtue is visible, their achievements praiseworthy.\nThus they lack virtue.\nBecause of their titles and personal fame.\nThe highest virtue practices non-action—\nthey model themselves on the Dao’s tranquility, refraining from all contrivance.\nAnd has no purpose—\nthey do not act for the sake of titles or fame.\n\nThe lesser virtue acts—\nthis refers to issuing teachings and commands, implementing governance.\nAnd has purpose—\nthis means acting to acquire titles and fame for oneself.\n\nThe highest benevolence acts—\n*highest benevolence*: rulers who practice benevolence, whose benevolence is supreme, hence called \"highest benevolence.\"\nActing here means bestowing kindness upon others.\nYet has no purpose—\nonce merit is achieved and affairs are established, they do not cling to action.\n\nThe highest righteousness acts—\nacting with righteousness to make judgments and divisions.\nYet has purpose—\ntheir actions are for their own sake, killing to establish authority, harming inferiors to enrich themselves.\n\nThe highest propriety acts—\n*highest propriety*: rulers whose propriety is supreme, hence called \"highest propriety.\"\nActing here means establishing ritual systems and ordering ceremonial dignity.\nYet none respond—\nthis means propriety is florid but substance is lacking, adornments and deceit are excessive, and movement strays from the Dao, making it impossible to respond.\nThen they roll up their sleeves and drag others along—\nthis means propriety’s excesses make response impossible, leading to conflict between superiors and inferiors, hence they roll up their sleeves and pull one another.\n\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows;\nthis means the Dao declines and virtuous transformation arises.\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence follows;\nthis means virtue declines and benevolent love appears.\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;\nthis means benevolence declines and distinctions of righteousness become clear.\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety follows—\nthis means righteousness declines and ritual exchanges with jade and silk arise.\n\nNow, propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust—\nthis means propriety abandons the root to govern the branches, and loyalty and trust daily grow thinner.\nAnd the beginning of chaos—\npropriety values ornament over substance, thus uprightness daily diminishes while deceit and disorder daily increase.\n\nThose with foresight are the blossoms of the Dao—\nthose who claim knowledge without true knowing are called \"foresight\"; such people, in the Dao’s decline, grasp only its blossoms.\nAnd the beginning of foolishness—\nthis means those with foresight are the vanguard of ignorance and darkness.\n\nTherefore, the great man abides in the substantial—\n*great man*: the ruler who attains the Dao.\nAbiding in the substantial means dwelling in simplicity and sincerity.\nNot in the insubstantial—\nnot dwelling in ways that violate the Dao and bring worldly turmoil.\nAbides in the real—\ndwelling in loyalty and trust.\nNot in the ornamental—\nnot prizing florid speech.\nThus, he rejects that and embraces this—\nrejecting the ornamental and insubstantial, embracing the real and substantial.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Attaining Unity**\n\nOf old, those who attained the One:\n*Of old*: in the past.\n*One*: non-action, the child of the Dao.\n\nHeaven attained the One and became clear—\nthis means heaven attained the One and thus could display its luminous signs.\nEarth attained the One and became stable—\nthis means earth attained the One and thus could remain tranquil and unshaken.\nThe spirits attained the One and became numinous—\nthis means the spirits attained the One and thus could transform without form.\nThe valleys attained the One and became full—\nthis means the valleys attained the One and thus could remain full without exhaustion.\nThe myriad things attained the One and came to life—\nthis means all things require the Dao to come into being.\nThe lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for the world—\nthis means the lords and kings attained the One and thus could bring balance and uprightness to the world.\n\nSuch is their attainment—\n*attainment*: admonition.\nReferring to the six matters above.\n\nIf heaven had nothing by which to be clear, it would fear splitting—\nthis means heaven must alternate between yin and yang, day and night; it cannot merely seek clarity without end, lest it split and cease to be heaven.\nIf earth had nothing by which to be stable, it would fear erupting—\nthis means earth must have high and low, hard and soft, seasonal qi and the five phases; it cannot merely seek stability without end, lest it erupt and cease to be earth.\nIf the spirits had nothing by which to be numinous, they would fear ceasing—\nthis means the spirits must have periods of waxing, waning, imprisonment, death, rest, and decline; they cannot merely seek numinous transformation without end, lest they become empty and cease to be spirits.\nIf the valleys had nothing by which to be full, they would fear drying up—\nthis means the valleys must have expansion and contraction, emptiness and fullness; they cannot merely seek fullness without end, lest they dry up and cease to be valleys.\nIf the myriad things had nothing by which to live, they would fear perishing—\nthis means all things must follow the seasons in life and death; they cannot merely seek long life without end, lest they perish and cease to be things.\nIf the lords and kings had nothing by which to be noble and exalted, they would fear stumbling—\nthis means the lords and kings must humble themselves to serve others, diligently seeking the worthy; they cannot merely seek to be noble and exalted without end, lest they stumble and lose their positions.\n\nThus, the noble takes the humble as its root—\nthis means if one desires honor and nobility, one must take humility and lowliness as the root, as Yu and Ji tilled the fields themselves, Shun made pottery by the river, and the Duke of Zhou visited humble dwellings.\nThe exalted takes the low as its foundation—\nthis means if one desires honor and nobility, one must take the low as the foundation, just as building a wall requires starting from the base to reach the heights; without a firm foundation below, it will later collapse.\nTherefore, the lords and kings call themselves \"the orphaned,\" \"the widowed,\" and \"the unworthy\"—\n*orphaned* and *widowed* signify solitude; *unworthy* signifies being unable to serve as the hub for the spokes.\nIs this not taking the humble as the root?\nThis means that though the lords and kings are most noble, they can call themselves \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"unworthy\"—is this not taking the humble as the root? This is to enlighten others.\nIs it not so!\nAn exclamation of admiration.\n\nThus, when one assembles the parts of a carriage—its spokes, wheels, hub, axle, and frame—there is no single part called \"carriage\"; only when combined does it become one. This illustrates how lords and kings do not claim honorific titles for themselves, and thus attain true nobility.\n\nDo not desire to gleam like jade or clatter like stone.\n*Gleaming* suggests rarity, *clattering* suggests abundance; jade is rare and thus prized, stone is plentiful and thus despised. This means one should not seek to be valued like jade or scorned like stone, but rather abide in the mean.\n\n**Chapter Forty: Reversal**\nReversal is the movement of the Dao.\n*Reversal* means returning to the root. The root is the source of the Dao’s movement, from which all things arise; to turn away from it is to perish.\nWeakness is the function of the Dao.\nSoftness and weakness are what the Dao constantly employs, and thus it endures forever.\n\nAll things under heaven are born from Being,\nAll things arise from Heaven and Earth, which possess form and position—thus they are said to be born from Being.\nBeing is born from Nonbeing.\nThe numinous radiance of Heaven and Earth, the fluttering of insects and wriggling of creatures—all emerge from the Dao. The Dao has no form, thus it is said to be born from Nonbeing.\nThis speaks of the root prevailing over the flower, weakness prevailing over strength, and humility prevailing over fullness.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: Sameness and Difference**\nWhen the highest scholar hears the Dao, they diligently practice it.\nThe highest scholar, upon hearing the Dao, exerts themselves strenuously to put it into practice.\nWhen the middling scholar hears the Dao, they hold it as if it exists, as if it does not.\nThe middling scholar, upon hearing the Dao, cultivates themselves to attain longevity and governs the state to achieve great peace, embracing it joyfully. Yet when they retreat and encounter wealth, beauty, or honor, they are deluded by desire and lose it again.\nWhen the lowest scholar hears the Dao, they laugh loudly at it.\nThe lowest scholar, greedy and full of desires, sees the Dao’s softness and calls it cowardice; sees its plainness and calls it vulgar. Thus, they laugh at it.\nIf it is not laughed at, it would not be worthy of being called the Dao.\nIf it were not scorned by the lowest scholar, it would not deserve the name of Dao.\n\nThus, established sayings declare:\n*Established* means set forth. These sayings illustrate how one with the Dao should be, as in the following lines.\nThe Dao that is bright appears dim;\nOne who embodies the luminous Dao seems obscure, as if lacking perception.\nThe Dao that advances appears to retreat;\nOne who pursues the Dao seems to fall behind.\nThe Dao that is level appears uneven.\n*Level* means even. One who embodies the great Dao does not distinguish themselves but seems to blend with the multitude.\nThe highest virtue resembles a valley;\nOne of the highest virtue resembles a deep valley, unashamed of filth and impurity.\nThe purest white appears sullied;\nOne of the greatest purity seems tainted, not seeking to display themselves.\nThe most expansive virtue appears insufficient;\nOne whose virtue is vast seems dull and inadequate.\nEstablished virtue appears deficient;\nOne who cultivates virtue seems as if they could be depleted.\nUnadorned truth appears tarnished;\nOne of unadorned truth seems as if their colors have faded and lost their brilliance.\nThe greatest square has no corners;\nOne of perfect integrity has no rigid edges.\nThe greatest vessel is slow to complete;\nOne of great capacity, like the Nine Tripods or ritual vessels, cannot be swiftly forged.\nThe greatest sound is scarcely heard;\nThe greatest sound, like thunder waiting for the right moment to strike, illustrates how one should cherish qi and minimize speech.\nThe greatest image has no form;\nOne who embodies the great image is plain and without adornment.\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless.\nThe Dao is concealed, leaving no one able to name it.\nOnly the Dao is good at bestowing and completing.\n*Completing* means bringing to fruition. The Dao excels at endowing people with essence and qi, and bringing them to fulfillment.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: Transformation of the Dao**\nThe Dao gives birth to the One,\nThe Dao causes what it generates to be unified.\nThe One gives birth to the Two,\nThe One gives rise to yin and yang.\nThe Two gives birth to the Three,\nYin and yang generate the harmonious, clear, and turbid qi, dividing into Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.\nThe Three give birth to the myriad things.\nHeaven, Earth, and Humanity together generate the myriad things. Heaven bestows, Earth transforms, and Humanity nurtures them.\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nAll things bear yin and face yang, turning their hearts toward the sun.\nAnd blend their qi to attain harmony.\nAll things contain primordial qi, which enables their softness and harmony—like the chest containing organs, bones containing marrow, and plants having hollows through which qi flows, allowing them to endure.\n\nWhat people despise are \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"unworthy,\" yet kings and lords use these as their titles.\n*Orphaned*, *widowed*, and *unworthy* are inauspicious names, yet kings and lords adopt them to embody humility, modeling themselves on emptiness, softness, and harmony.\nThus, some things are diminished yet augmented,\nWhen pulled, they cannot be drawn away; when pushed, they inevitably return.\nOthers are augmented yet diminished.\nThose who seek to elevate themselves will collapse; those who covet wealth will invite disaster.\n\nWhat people teach,\nThis refers to the common teaching of abandoning weakness for strength, and softness for rigidity.\nI also teach them.\nI teach people to abandon strength for weakness, and rigidity for softness.\nThe strong and violent do not meet a natural death.\nThe *strong and violent* are those who disbelieve in the profound and mysterious, rebel against the Dao and virtue, disregard scriptural teachings, and rely on power and force.\n*Do not meet a natural death* means being cut off by Heaven’s decree, slain by weapons, or executed by royal law—dying without the fulfillment of their allotted lifespan.\nI will take this as the father of my teaching.\n*Father* means origin. Laozi uses the example of the strong and violent as the starting point for admonition.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: Partial Use**\nThe softest under heaven gallops through the hardest under heaven.\nThe softest is water; the hardest is metal and stone. Water can penetrate the firm and enter the rigid, flowing without obstruction.\nThat which has no substance enters where there is no gap.\n*That which has no substance* refers to the Dao. The Dao has no form or substance, thus it can enter where there are no gaps, communicating with the numinous and aiding all beings.\nThus, I know the benefit of non-action.\nI see how the Dao, through non-action, allows the myriad things to transform and complete themselves—thus I know the benefit of non-action for humanity.\nTeaching without words,\nFollowing the Dao’s example of not speaking, one teaches through embodiment.\n\n**The Benefits of Non-Action**\nThe benefits of non-action—following the Dao’s non-action—govern the body to benefit the spirit, govern the state to benefit the myriad people, without wearisome toil.\nFew under heaven attain this.\n*Under heaven* refers to the ruler. Few can match the governance of body and state through the Dao’s non-action.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: Establishing Admonitions**\nFame or the self—which is dearer?\nWhen fame advances, the self retreats.\nThe self or wealth—which is greater?\nWhen wealth accumulates, it harms the self.\nGain or loss—which is more harmful?\nTo covet gain is to sicken one’s conduct.\nExcessive love incurs great cost:\nExcessive love of beauty drains the spirit.\nExcessive love of wealth invites misfortune.\nWhat is loved is little; what is lost is much—hence, *great cost*.\nHoarding much ensures heavy loss.\nIn life, hoarding fills storehouses; in death, it fills tombs.\nLiving, one fears robbery and plunder; dead, one fears grave-robbers and coffin-thieves.\nKnowing contentment avoids disgrace.\nThose who know contentment sever profit and abandon desire, sparing themselves disgrace.\nKnowing when to stop averts peril.\nKnowing where to stop, wealth and profit do not burden the self, nor do sounds and sights disorder the ears and eyes—thus the self avoids danger.\nThis can endure long.\nThose who know when to stop and when to be content hold fortune and blessing in themselves. In governing the body, the spirit is not wearied; in governing the state, the people are not disturbed—thus it may endure long.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Vast Virtue**\nGreat perfection seems flawed.\n*Great perfection* refers to a ruler whose virtue and Dao are fully realized. *Seems flawed* means concealing fame and hiding merit, appearing broken and incomplete.\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\nWith such a mind, its use knows no end.\nGreat fullness seems empty.\n*Great fullness* refers to a ruler whose virtue and Dao overflow. *Seems empty* means nobility does not breed arrogance, wealth does not breed extravagance.\nYet its use is boundless.\nWith such a mind, its use knows no limit.\nGreat straightness seems bent.\n*Great straightness* means cultivating the Dao and upholding standards with unwavering integrity. *Seems bent* means not contending with the vulgar, appearing yielding.\nGreat skill seems clumsy.\n*Great skill* refers to abundant talent and technique. *Seems clumsy* means not daring to display one’s abilities.\nGreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\n*Great eloquence* means wisdom without doubt. *Seems inarticulate* means speech without sophistry.\nStillness overcomes heat,\n*Overcomes* means to the utmost.\n\nIn spring and summer, yang qi surges swiftly above, and the myriad things flourish in fullness. When fullness reaches its extreme, cold arrives, and cold brings withering and death. This teaches that one should not be rigid or restless.\n\nStillness overcomes heat. In autumn and winter, the myriad things rest in the yellow springs below. When stillness reaches its extreme, heat arises—heat is the source of life. Clarity and stillness can rectify all under heaven. If one can be clear and still, one becomes the enduring ruler of all under heaven. Maintaining integrity ensures no end.\n\n**Chapter 46: Restraining Desires**\nWhen all under heaven follows the Dao,\nthis means the ruler embodies the Dao.\nHorses are retired to fertilize the fields.\n*Fertilize* means to enrich the fields. Those who govern the state cease using weapons and chariots, returning horses to cultivate the land. Those who cultivate the self return yang essence to nourish their bodies.\n\nWhen all under heaven abandons the Dao,\nthis means the ruler has lost the Dao.\nWarhorses breed on the outskirts.\nWarfare never ceases, and warhorses are born on the borders, never to return.\n\nNo sin is greater than indulging desire.\nThis refers to excessive lust.\nNo disaster is greater than not knowing contentment.\nWealth and nobility cannot restrain themselves.\nNo fault is greater than covetousness.\nCoveting others’ possessions is both greedy and grasping.\n\nThus, the contentment of knowing contentment\nmeans guarding the root of truth.\nIs always content.\nIt means having no desire.\n\n**Chapter 47: Mirroring the Distant**\nWithout leaving the household, one knows all under heaven.\nThe sage knows all under heaven without leaving the household by understanding others through oneself and other families through one’s own. Thus, all under heaven is seen.\n\nWithout peering through the window, one perceives the Dao of heaven.\nThe Dao of heaven and the Dao of humanity are one; heaven and humanity are interconnected, their qi flowing as one. When the ruler is clear and still, the qi of heaven naturally aligns. When the ruler is full of desires, the qi of heaven becomes turbid. Fortune and misfortune, benefit and harm—all arise from oneself.\n\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nThis means leaving one’s home to observe others’ homes, departing from oneself to observe others. The farther one observes, the less one truly sees.\n\nThus, the sage knows without traveling,\nthe sage, without ascending to heaven or descending into the abyss, understands all under heaven through the heart.\nNames without seeing.\nWhen superiors favor the Dao, inferiors favor virtue; when superiors favor martial prowess, inferiors favor brute force. The sage infers the great from the small, perceives the external by examining the internal.\nAccomplishes without acting.\nWhen superiors do nothing, inferiors follow suit, households are provided for, and the people are content. The myriad things transform of their own accord.\n\n**Chapter 48: Forgetting Knowledge**\nPursuing learning leads to daily increase.\n*Learning* refers to the study of governance, teachings, rituals, and music. *Daily increase* means that emotions, desires, and embellishments grow more abundant each day.\n\nPursuing the Dao leads to daily diminishment.\n*Dao* refers to the Dao of nature. *Daily diminishment* means that emotions, desires, and embellishments gradually fade away.\n\nDiminish and further diminish,\n*Diminish* means reducing desires. *Further diminish* means gradually eliminating them.\nuntil one reaches non-action.\nOne should be as serene and uncontrived as an infant.\nThen there is nothing that is not done.\nWhen desires are severed and virtue merges with the Dao, there is nothing that cannot be applied, nothing that cannot be accomplished.\n\nGoverning all under heaven always relies on non-action.\n*Governing* means to rule. To rule all under heaven, one must rely on non-action, not on toil and disturbance.\nWhen one engages in action, it is insufficient to govern all under heaven.\nWhen one favors action, governance becomes burdensome, the people are unsettled, and thus it is insufficient to rule all under heaven.\n\n**Chapter 49: Entrusting Virtue**\nThe sage has no constant mind.\nThe sage values change and continuity, prizing compliance as if having no mind of his own.\nHe takes the minds of the people as his mind.\nThe sage follows what is convenient for the people’s minds.\n\nThe good, I treat as good.\nWhen the people act virtuously, the sage treats them as good.\nThe not-good, I also treat as good.\nThough some among the people may not be good, the sage transforms them to be good.\nThus, virtue is goodness.\nWhen the people are morally transformed, the sage deems them good.\n\nThe trustworthy, I trust.\nWhen the people are trustworthy, the sage trusts them.\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust.\nWhen the people are untrustworthy, the sage transforms them to be trustworthy.\nThus, virtue is trust.\nWhen the people are morally transformed, the sage deems them trustworthy.\n\nThe sage in all under heaven is cautious and reverent,\nthe sage in all under heaven is always cautious and fearful, never arrogant or extravagant in wealth and nobility.\nand blends his mind for all under heaven.\nThis means the sage’s mind for all under heaven is as if muddled, appearing ignorant and unenlightened.\n\nThe people all fix their ears and eyes upon him.\n*Fix* means to employ. The people all use their ears and eyes to serve the sage’s seeing and hearing.\nThe sage treats them all as children.\nThe sage cherishes the people as infants, nurturing them without expecting repayment.\n\n**Chapter 50: Valuing Life**\nEmerging into life, entering into death.\n*Emerging into life* means desires arise from within, the hun-soul is tranquil, and the po-soul is settled—thus, life. *Entering into death* means desires lodge in the chest, essence is exhausted, and spirit is confused—thus, death.\n\nThose who follow life number thirteen; those who follow death number thirteen.\nThis speaks of the categories of life and death, each numbering thirteen, referring to the nine orifices and four gates.\n\nIn life, the eyes do not recklessly see, the ears do not recklessly hear, the nose does not recklessly smell, the mouth does not recklessly speak, the tongue does not recklessly taste, the hands do not recklessly grasp, the feet do not recklessly walk, and the spirit is not recklessly expended.\nIn death, the opposite holds true.\n\nPeople in life move toward the realm of death—thirteen in number.\nThough people seek life, their actions lead them to the thirteen realms of death.\nWhy is this?\nThis asks why they move toward the realm of death.\nBecause they seek life too fervently.\nThe reason people move toward the realm of death is that their pursuit of life is too excessive, violating the Dao and opposing heaven, acting recklessly and losing discipline.\n\nYet I have heard that those skilled in nurturing life,\n*nurturing* means cultivation,\nwalk the road without encountering rhinoceroses or tigers.\nNaturally avoiding harm, they remain untouched by danger.\n\nEntering the army without donning armor or weapons, disliking war and the killing of men. The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn, the tiger no place to set its claws, and weapons no place to lodge their blades. For those who cultivate life, rhinoceroses and tigers have no means to harm them, and blades have no way to strike them.\n\nWhy is this?\nThis asks why rhinoceroses, tigers, and weapons do not harm them.\nBecause they do not enter the realm of death.\nBecause they do not transgress the thirteen realms of death.\nIt is said that the spirit’s luminous protection guards them, so these things dare not harm them.\n\n**Cultivating Virtue Fifty-First**\nThe Dao gives them life.\nThe Dao gives life to the ten thousand things.\nVirtue nurtures them.\nVirtue is the One. The One distributes qi and nurtures them.\nIt shapes their forms.\nThe One establishes the forms of the ten thousand things.\nIt completes them through conditions.\nThe One creates the conditions of cold and heat to perfect them.\nThus, the ten thousand things none fail to honor the Dao and treasure virtue.\nWhat the Dao and virtue accomplish, the ten thousand things all respond to with reverence.\nThe Dao’s honor, virtue’s treasure—nothing commands them, yet they are always naturally so.\nThe Dao-One does not summon the ten thousand things, yet they always respond to it as naturally as an echo or shadow.\n\nThus, the Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, rears them, nourishes them, completes them, ripens them, shelters them, and covers them.\nThe Dao’s relation to the ten thousand things is not merely to give life but also to rear, nourish, complete, ripen, shelter, and protect, preserving their nature and destiny.\nThe ruler who governs the state and cultivates the self should do likewise.\n\nIt gives life yet does not possess,\nThe Dao gives life to the ten thousand things yet does not claim them for its own gain.\nIt acts yet does not rely,\nThe Dao’s actions do not depend on expectation of reward.\nIt rears yet does not dominate,\nThe Dao rears the ten thousand things yet does not control them for its own benefit.\nThis is called profound virtue.\nThe Dao’s benevolent power is dark and unseen.\n\n**Returning to the Origin Fifty-Second**\nThe world has a beginning,\nThe beginning is the Dao.\nWhich is taken as the mother of the world.\nThe Dao is the mother of the ten thousand things under heaven.\nHaving known the mother, one also knows her child.\nThe child is the One. Having known the Dao, one should also know the One.\nHaving known the child, one again guards the mother.\nHaving known the One, one should again guard the Dao and return to non-action.\nThus, one’s body does not perish.\nOne remains free from danger.\n\nSeal its apertures,\nThe apertures are the eyes. Let the eyes not recklessly see.\nClose its gates,\nThe gates are the mouth. Let the mouth not recklessly speak.\nAnd one’s life will not be exhausted.\nIf one seals the eyes from reckless seeing and closes the mouth from reckless speech, one’s life will not be worn out.\nOpen its apertures,\nOpen the eyes to desires.\nAnd further its affairs,\nFurther the affairs of desire.\nAnd one’s life will be beyond saving.\nDisaster and chaos will arise.\n\nSeeing the small is called clarity,\nThe first stirrings of misfortune, before harm appears, are small; to perceive them alone is clarity.\nGuarding the soft is called strength.\nTo guard softness is to grow daily in strength.\nUse its light,\nUse the light of the eyes to observe the world’s advantages and harms.\nAnd return to its clarity.\nReturn the light inward, lest the spirit leak away.\nDo not leave the body to calamity,\nInward vision preserves the spirit, preventing loss.\nThis is called practicing the eternal.\nTo practice this is to cultivate the constant Dao.\n\n**Adding Evidence Fifty-Third**\nIf I were suddenly granted knowledge, I would walk the great Dao.\n*Jie* means great. Laozi laments that the rulers of his time do not walk the great Dao, so he speaks thus: If I were suddenly granted knowledge of governance, I would walk the great Dao, personally practicing the transformation of non-action.\nOnly action is to be feared.\nOnly to act is to be feared, lest one lose the Dao’s intent.\nDesiring to reward goodness, one fears false goodness will arise;\nDesiring to trust loyalty, one fears false loyalty will appear.\nThe great Dao is level,\nLevel means smooth and easy.\nYet the people prefer byways.\nByways are crooked and not upright. The great Dao is smooth and easy, yet the people prefer crooked paths.\nThe court is excessively adorned,\nHigh towers and pavilions, palaces and halls are refined.\nThe fields are excessively overgrown,\nAgriculture is abandoned, and the land is not cultivated.\nThe granaries are excessively empty,\nThe five grains are damaged, and the state has no reserves.\nThey wear embroidered silks,\nThey delight in adornment and value outward splendor.\n\nThey gird themselves with sharp swords, prizing hardness and strength, martial and extravagant. They surfeit on food and drink, hoard wealth in excess, indulge in many desires, never satisfied. This is called \"robber’s arrogance.\"\n\nWhen the common people are impoverished while the ruler abounds in surplus, it is because he plunders and robs to adorn himself, parading his ostentation before others, unaware that his own death and family’s ruin will soon follow, with kin and kindred swept away with him. Such \"robber’s arrogance\" is not the Dao. When a ruler acts thus, this is not the Dao. The phrase \"also, alas!\" expresses deep sorrow.\n\n**Cultivating Observation (Chapter 54)**\nWhat is well established cannot be uprooted.\nTo establish means to erect. One who skillfully founds self and state upon the Dao cannot be pulled away or uprooted.\nWhat is well embraced cannot be loosed.\nOne who skillfully embraces the spirit with the Dao can never be torn away or released.\nDescendants’ sacrifices will not cease.\nFor descendants who cultivate the Dao thus, long life and immortality endure through generations, and ancestral sacrifices in the ancestral temple never end.\n\nCultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true.\nCultivating the Dao in the self—cherishing qi and nurturing the spirit—prolongs life and extends years. Such virtue is that of a true person.\nCultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant.\nCultivating the Dao in the family—father kind, son filial; elder brother friendly, younger brother respectful; husband faithful, wife chaste—brings surplus blessings to descendants in future generations.\nCultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue becomes enduring.\nCultivating the Dao in the village—honoring elders, nurturing the young, instructing the ignorant—ensures that no one is left unprotected.\nCultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue becomes bountiful.\nCultivating the Dao in the state—ruler trustworthy, ministers loyal; benevolence and righteousness arise spontaneously; ritual and music flourish naturally; governance is impartial and selfless—yields virtue that is rich and full.\nCultivate it in the world, and one’s virtue becomes universal.\nWhen the ruler cultivates the Dao throughout the world, transformation occurs without words, order without instruction; the response of the people to their superior is as swift as echo follows sound. Such virtue is all-pervading.\n\nThus, observe the self through the self.\nObserve the unrefined self through the self that cultivates the Dao—who perishes, who endures?\nObserve the family through the family.\nObserve the unrefined family through the family that cultivates the Dao.\nObserve the village through the village.\nObserve the unrefined village through the village that cultivates the Dao.\nObserve the state through the state.\nObserve the unrefined state through the state that cultivates the Dao.\nObserve the world through the world.\nObserve the unrefined ruler through the ruler who cultivates the Dao.\nHow do I know the world is thus? By this.\nLaozi says: How do I know that those who cultivate the Dao prosper while those who turn from it perish? I observe and know this through these five matters.\n\n**Mysterious Sign (Chapter 55)**\nOne whose virtue is profoundly embraced\nRefers to one who deeply holds virtue within.\nis like an infant.\nThe numinous protection of such a person is as parents’ care for an infant.\nPoisonous insects do not sting,\nBees, scorpions, snakes, and vipers do not sting.\n\nFierce beasts do not seize, birds of prey do not strike.\nThe infant harms no creature, and no creature harms the infant.\nThus in an age of Great Peace, whether noble or base, all possess a heart of benevolence.\nThings with thorns revert to their root; creatures with venom do not harm humanity.\nBones weak, sinews soft, yet the grasp is firm.\nThe infant’s sinews and bones are soft and weak, yet its hold is steadfast—its intent is single, its heart unwavering.\nNot knowing the union of male and female, yet the organ stirs to utmost vigor.\nThe infant knows not the coupling of man and woman, yet its yang energy surges—this arises from the abundance of its essence and qi.\nCrying all day without hoarseness—such is the perfection of harmony.\nFrom dawn to dusk, the infant’s wailing voice remains unchanged—this comes from the abundance of harmonious qi.\nTo know harmony is to know constancy.\nOne who knows the harmonious and yielding qi that benefits others knows the constancy of the Dao.\nTo know constancy is to be enlightened.\nOne who knows the constancy of the Dao daily deepens in clarity and penetrates the mysterious.\nPursuing life brings ominous growth.\n\"Ominous\" means prolonged. To pursue life and indulge in self-preservation is to daily expand in excess.\nThe heart directs qi to daily strength.\nThe heart should remain focused, harmonious, and yielding, with spirit and qi filling the interior—thus the form remains supple.\nYet if one acts recklessly, harmony departs from within, and the body daily hardens.\nWhen things reach their prime, they age.\nAll things that reach their peak wither and grow old.\nThis is called \"not-Dao.\"\nTo wither and age is to lose the Dao.\nWhat is not-Dao perishes early.\n\n**Mysterious Virtue (Chapter 56)**\nThe wise do not speak.\nThe wise value action over words.\nThose who speak are not wise.\nA team of horses cannot overtake the tongue—much speech brings many troubles.\nBlock the apertures, close the gates.\nTo block and close is to sever the source.\nBlunt the sharpness.\nWhen desires and passions drive one to sharp action, one should contemplate the Dao’s non-action to temper and restrain them.\nUntie the tangles.\n\"Tangles\" are knots of resentment that never cease. One should contemplate the Dao’s tranquility to dissolve them.\nHarmonize the light.\nThough possessing unique insight and clarity, one should harmonize it to dim its brilliance, lest it dazzle and confuse others.\nBlend with the dust.\nOne should not set oneself apart.\nThis is called \"mysterious sameness.\"\n\"Mysterious\" is Heaven. One who practices these things above is said to align with Heaven’s Dao.\nThus one cannot be drawn near,\nNot delighting in honor, not grieving in solitude.\nNor kept at a distance.\nWith a still mind and no desires, one bears no grudges.\nOne cannot be benefited,\nNot seeking wealth or fine flavors.\nNor harmed.\nNot contending for profit with the greedy, nor for pride with the fierce.\nOne cannot be exalted,\nNot serving as a ruler in chaotic times, nor holding office under a benighted lord.\nNor debased.\nNot growing arrogant with power, nor bending in defeat.\nThus one is honored by the world.\nWith such virtue, even the Son of Heaven cannot make one a subject, nor feudal lords bend one’s will.\nMoving with the world, preserving oneself, and avoiding harm, one is honored by all under Heaven.\n\n**Pure Wind (Chapter 57)**\nGovern the state with uprightness.\n\"With\" means \"to the utmost.\" Heaven appoints those of upright character to rule states.\nDeploy troops with cunning.\n\"Cunning\" is deception. Heaven appoints those skilled in deceit to command armies.\nWin the world through non-action.\nHeaven appoints those who practice non-action to become lords of the world.\nHow do I know this is so? By this.\n\"This\" refers to the present. Laozi says: How do I know Heaven’s will is thus? By what I observe today.\nThe more taboos in the world, the poorer the people.\n\"The world\" refers to the ruler. \"Taboos\" are prohibitions. Excessive restrictions breed deceit below, and the people grow poorer as they exhaust themselves in evasion.\nThe more sharp tools the people possess, the more the state descends into chaos.\n\"Sharp tools\" are powers. When the people wield many powers, the eyes of observers grow dazzled, the ears of listeners confused, and ruler and subject grow estranged—thus the state falls into disorder.\nThe more people cultivate cleverness, the more strange things arise.\n\"People\" refers to rulers and local lords. \"Cultivate cleverness\" means adorning palaces, carving and painting robes and regalia. As strange things proliferate, those below emulate those above, embellishing gold, engraving jade, and embroidering with ever more lavish colors.\nThe more laws and fine objects are displayed, the more thieves and bandits appear.\n\"Fine objects\" are prized possessions.\n\nWhen rare and prized objects proliferate and grow conspicuous, agricultural work is abandoned, hunger and cold arrive together, and thieves and bandits multiply. Thus the sage declares: this concerns the affairs of those below. \"I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves.\" The sage says: I cultivate the Dao and align with Heaven, introducing no alterations or contrivances, and the people naturally achieve transformation. \"I favor stillness, and the people rectify themselves.\" The sage says: I favor stillness, neither speaking nor instructing, and the people naturally become loyal and upright. \"I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves.\" I impose no corvée labor or conscription, so the people remain secure in their occupations and thus all grow wealthy. \"I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.\" I constantly have no desires, discard ornate patterns, and diminish adornments, so the people follow me in embracing plainness.\n\n[I have no passions, and the people purify themselves.\" The sage says: I cultivate the Dao and preserve authenticity, cutting off the six passions, and the people naturally follow me in attaining purity.]\n\n**Chapter 58: Following Transformation**\n\nWhen governance is dull and unobtrusive,\nits policies and teachings are lenient and broad, dull and obscure, seemingly unclear.\nIts people are honest and sincere,\nfor lenient governance fosters richness and prosperity, and the people grow close and harmonious.\n\nWhen governance is sharp and exacting,\nits policies and teachings are hasty and severe, decisions made by word of mouth, judgments by ear.\nIts people are lacking and deficient.\nUnder hasty governance, the people cannot sustain themselves, growing ever more distant and thin.\n\nMisfortune is where fortune leans,\n\"Leans\" means \"depends upon.\" For fortune arises from misfortune: when people encounter misfortune and can repent, examine themselves, cultivate the Dao, and perform good deeds, then misfortune departs and fortune arrives.\nFortune is where misfortune lies concealed.\nMisfortune hides within fortune: when people obtain fortune and grow arrogant and indulgent, then fortune departs and misfortune arrives.\nWho knows its ultimate end?\nMisfortune and fortune give rise to one another—who can know when their cycle will reach its limit?\nThere is no constancy.\n\nA ruler who does not rectify himself will lose his state.\nWhen rectitude becomes perverse,\n\"Perverse\" means \"deceitful.\" If the ruler is not rectified, even when those below are rectified, they will transform to follow the ruler’s deceit.\nWhen goodness becomes ominous,\nGood people will all transform to follow the ruler’s ominous omens.\nThe people’s delusion has endured for long indeed.\nThis speaks of how the ruler’s delusion and loss of rectitude have persisted for a long time.\n\nThus the sage is square but does not cut,\nThe sage acts with square integrity to lead those below, not to sever or harm them.\nSharp but does not injure,\n\"Injure\" means \"to wound.\" The sage acts with sharp clarity to transform the people, not to wound them.\nNow it is otherwise: one rectifies oneself only to harm others.\nStraight but not unrestrained,\n\"Unrestrained\" means \"to extend.\" Though the sage is straight, he bends himself to follow others and does not impose his own will.\nRadiant but not dazzling.\nThough the sage possesses unique insight, he remains as if dim, not using his brilliance to confuse others.\n\n**Guarding the Dao (Chapter 59)**\nIn governing the people,\nThis refers to the ruler governing the people.\nAnd serving Heaven,\n\"Serving\" means \"to employ.\" One should employ the Way of Heaven and follow the four seasons.\nNothing compares to frugality.\n\"Frugality\" means \"to cherish.\" Those who govern the state should cherish the people’s resources and not indulge in extravagance. Those who cultivate themselves should cherish their essence and qi, not allowing dissipation.\nFor frugality is called \"early attainment.\"\n\"Early\" means \"prior,\" and \"attainment\" means \"to obtain.\" By cherishing the people’s resources and one’s essence and qi, one can first obtain the Way of Heaven.\n\"Early attainment\" is called \"accumulating virtue in abundance.\"\nTo first obtain the Way of Heaven is to accumulate virtue abundantly within oneself.\nAccumulating virtue in abundance leads to invincibility,\n\"Invincibility\" means \"to overcome.\" By accumulating virtue abundantly within oneself, there is nothing one cannot overcome.\nInvincibility means none can know its limit,\nWhen there is nothing one cannot overcome, none can know the limit of one’s virtue.\nAnd none knowing its limit means one can possess the state.\nWhen none can know the limit of one’s virtue, one can possess the altars of soil and grain and bring blessings to the people.\nPossessing the mother of the state ensures long duration.\nState and self are the same. \"Mother\" is the Dao. If one can preserve the Dao within oneself, ensuring that essence and qi are not exhausted and the five spirits are not harmed, then one can endure long.\nThis is called \"deep roots and firm stem,\"\nOne should take qi as the root and essence as the stem. Just as a tree with shallow roots is uprooted and fruit with a weak stem falls, one should deeply store one’s qi and firmly guard one’s essence, allowing no leakage.\nThe Way of long life and enduring vision.\n\n**Holding Office (Chapter 60)**\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\n\"Small fish\" refers to fish. When cooking a small fish, one does not remove its entrails or scales, nor dares to stir it, for fear of breaking it apart. Governing a state with excessive meddling causes disorder below; cultivating oneself with excessive meddling scatters one’s essence.\nWhen the Dao is applied to the world, its ghosts do not act as spirits.\nWhen one governs the world with virtue and the Dao, ghosts dare not use their spiritual power to harm people.\nIt is not that its ghosts lack spirit, but that their spirit does not harm people.\nIt is not that the ghosts lack spiritual power, but that they cannot harm those who are in accord with nature.\nIt is not that their spirit does not harm people, but that the sage also does not harm them.\nIt is not that ghosts and spirits cannot harm people. Because the sage in office does not harm people, ghosts dare not interfere.\nWhen the two do not harm each other,\nGhosts and the sage both refrain from harming one another.\nVirtue thus converges upon them.\nWhen the two do not harm each other, people are governed by the yang, ghosts by the yin; people preserve their lives, and ghosts preserve their spirits. Thus virtue converges upon them.\n\n**The Virtue of Humility (Chapter 61)**\nA great state is the lower reaches of the stream...\n\nA great state governing should be like the rivers and seas dwelling in the lower reaches, not opposing the subtle and small. The convergence of all under heaven—\nA great state is where the scholars and people of all under heaven gather.\nThe female of all under heaven.\nThe female belongs to the yin kind. Gentle, humble, and harmonious, she does not contend.\nThe female always overcomes the male with stillness; the woman can subdue the man, yin overcomes yang, because she is tranquil and does not seek precedence.\nWith stillness she takes the lower place.\nThe Way of yin takes tranquility and humility as its foundation.\nThus when a great state humbles itself before a small state, it wins the small state.\nBy being humble and lowly, it constantly possesses it.\nWhen a small state humbles itself before a great state, it wins the great state.\nThis means that regardless of size, if a state maintains humility and nurtures others, it will be without fault.\nThus some humble themselves to win, while others are humbled and win.\n\"Humble themselves\" refers to a great state lowering itself before a small state, or a small state lowering itself before a great state, each winning the other through righteousness.\nA great state desires nothing more than to nurture and embrace others.\nIf a great state does not lose its humility, it can annex and govern small states.\nA small state desires nothing more than to serve others,\nto act as a subject or servant.\nWhen both attain what they desire, the greater should be the more humble.\nWhen great and small states each seek their own desires, the great state should still be humble and lowly.\n\n**The Dao as the Treasure (Chapter 62)**\nThe Dao is the hidden sanctuary of the ten thousand things.\n\"Hidden\" means to conceal. The Dao conceals the ten thousand things, encompassing all without exclusion.\nIt is the treasure of the good,\nthe good regard the Dao as the treasure of their persons, never daring to transgress it.\nand the refuge of the not-good.\nThe Dao is what the not-good rely upon.\nWhen calamity strikes or urgency arises, they still know to repent and humble themselves.\nFine words can be traded in the marketplace.\nFine words alone can be exchanged in the marketplace. In market transactions, people part ways without mutual affection; buyers seek quick acquisition, sellers quick sale.\nNoble conduct can elevate a person.\n\"Elevate\" means to distinguish. One with noble and esteemed conduct can be set apart from ordinary people, though this is not yet sufficient to honor the Dao.\nWhy should those who are not good be abandoned?\nEven if people are not good, they should be transformed by the Dao. Before the Three Sovereigns, there were no abandoned people; virtue and transformation were pure.\nThus the Son of Heaven is established, and the Three Dukes are appointed,\nto teach and transform those who are not good.\nThough one may offer a large jade disk followed by a team of four horses,\nit is not as good as presenting this Dao while seated.\nThough one may arrive with a fine jade disk preceding a team of four horses, it is still not as good as quietly presenting this Dao.\nWhy was this Dao valued by the ancients?\nWhy did the ancients not daily seek it afar but find it near at hand?\nCan it be that through it, those with transgressions may be absolved?\n\"Those with transgressions\" refers to those who suffer in chaotic times, when benighted rulers recklessly impose corporal punishments. Cultivating the Dao can dissolve death and exempt one from the multitude.\nThus it is honored throughout all under heaven.\nThe Dao is vast and far-reaching, covering and aiding all without exception. It preserves the body and governs the state, tranquil and without action—thus it is honored throughout all under heaven.\n\n**Beginning with Grace (Chapter 63)**\nAct without acting,\n\nFollowing the natural course, one makes no forced creations.\nHandle affairs as if handling no affairs—anticipate with preparation, eliminating vexations and simplifying matters.\nSavor the flavorless.\nThrough deep contemplation and far-reaching foresight, one savors the meaning of the Dao.\nAddress the great and small, the many and few—\nthis is to set forth warnings and commands.\nDesiring greatness, one returns to smallness; desiring abundance, one returns to scarcity—such is the natural Dao.\nRepay resentment with virtue.\nCultivating the Dao and practicing goodness severs misfortune before it arises.\nPlan for difficulty while it is still easy.\nTo plan for difficult matters, act when they are easy, before they take shape.\nAchieve greatness from the minute.\nTo accomplish great things, begin with the small, for calamity and disorder arise from minor origins.\nThe difficult affairs of the world must begin with the easy; the great affairs of the world must begin with the minute.\nFrom the easy, difficulty arises; from the minute, the conspicuous emerges.\nThus the sage never attempts greatness, and so achieves greatness.\nAbiding in humility, all under heaven come to him.\nLight promises surely lack trust—\nfor words are not weighed.\nMuch ease surely brings much difficulty—\nfor dangers are not guarded against.\nThus the sage treats all as difficult,\nmoving with caution in action and decision, ever mindful of difficulty, seeking to close its source.\nTherefore, in the end, there is no difficulty.\nThe sage remains free from misfortune and hardship throughout life, ever deeply avoiding harm.\n\n**Guarding the Minute (Chapter 64)**\nWhat is secure is easily maintained;\ngoverning the body and the state in tranquility is easily preserved.\nWhat shows no sign is easily planned for;\nwhen passions, desires, and misfortunes have yet to manifest, they are easily forestalled.\nWhat is brittle is easily broken;\nwhen disorder has not yet stirred in the court and desires have not yet shown in countenance, they are as fragile and easily dispelled.\nWhat is minute is easily scattered;\nbefore it becomes evident, the small is easily dispersed.\nAct before it exists—\nto accomplish anything, block its inception when it is but a bud.\nGovern before disorder arises—\ngoverning body and state before chaos begins, one should preemptively close its gate.\nA tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tender shoot;\nfrom smallness, greatness arises.\nA nine-tiered terrace rises from mounded earth;\nfrom lowliness, height is established.\nA journey of a thousand *li* begins beneath the feet—\nfrom nearness, distance is reached.\nThose who act ruin it;\nacting in affairs, one abandons the natural; acting in righteousness, one abandons benevolence; acting in desire, one abandons the spirit.\nThose who grasp lose it.\nGrasping at profit invites calamity; grasping the Dao preserves the body, yet clinging without yielding brings reversal.\nThus the sage practices non-action and so suffers no ruin,\nfor the sage does not pursue ornate embellishments, sensual pleasures, or harmful excesses.\nPractices non-grasping and so suffers no loss,\nfor the sage possesses virtue to teach the foolish and wealth to aid the poor, holding nothing in reserve, and so loses nothing to others.\nThe people in their undertakings commonly fail when near completion.\n\"Undertakings\" mean actions. The people in their affairs, when merit and virtue are nearly complete, often ruin themselves through craving rank, seeking fame, and indulging in excess and fullness.\nBe as cautious at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no ruined affairs.\nThe end should be like the beginning—one must not grow lax.\nThus the sage desires what others do not desire.\nThe sage desires what others do not: others desire display, the sage desires hidden brilliance; others desire adornment, the sage desires simplicity; others desire sensuality, the sage desires virtue.\nDoes not value rare and precious goods;\nthe sage is not dazzled by fine attire, nor does he despise stone while prizing jade.\nLearns what others do not learn.\nThe sage learns what others cannot: others learn cunning and deceit, the sage learns the natural; others learn to govern the world, the sage learns to govern the self—thus preserving the true Dao.\nReturns to what the multitude has passed over;\nthe multitude in their learning reverses priorities, taking the root for the branch, the substance for the ornament.\nTo \"return\" is to revert to the root.\nAssists the naturalness of the myriad things.\nTeaching people to return to the root and substance is to aid the natural essence of all things.\nYet dares not act.\nThe sage moves in accord with the natural course, daring not force creation, fearing to stray from the root.\n\n**Pure Virtue (Chapter 65)**\nOf old, those skilled in the Dao did not enlighten the people but sought to make them simple.\nThose of old who were adept in the Dao, whether governing body or state, did not use the Dao to teach the people cleverness and deceit but instead instructed them in virtue and simplicity, fostering honesty and eschewing pretense.\nThe people are difficult to govern because of their cunning.\nThe people are hard to govern because their cleverness leads to deceit and artifice.\nThus to govern the state with cleverness is to be a thief of the state;\nif those with intelligence govern the state’s affairs, they will stray from the Dao, wantonly wielding power and profit, becoming thieves of the state.\nTo govern the state without cleverness is the state’s blessing.\nIf those with intelligence are not employed to govern the state’s affairs, the people will uphold integrity, avoid false adornments, and foster harmony between ruler and subject, becoming the state’s blessing.\nKnowing these two is also a model.\nThese two refer to the clever and the un-clever. Consistently, the clever become thieves, while the un-clever bring blessing—this is the model for governing body and state.\nConsistently knowing this model is called profound virtue.\n\"Profound\" means heavenly. To know the model for governing body and state is to share the virtue of heaven.\nProfound virtue is deep and far-reaching,\nthe person of profound virtue is unfathomably deep, unattainably distant.\nand turns back from things!\nThe person of profound virtue differs from the myriad things: while all things seek to benefit themselves, the person of profound virtue bestows upon others.\nOnly then does one attain great compliance.\nProfound virtue, differing from the myriad things, thus achieves great compliance—\ncompliance with the principles of heaven.\n\n**Putting Oneself Last (Chapter 66)**\n\nThe rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys because they excel at placing themselves below—thus they become kings of the hundred valleys. The rivers and seas, being lowly, draw all streams to them, just as the people turn to their king. By being lowly, they become kings of the hundred valleys.\n\nTherefore, one who wishes to be above the people must, in speech, place oneself below them—following the rivers and seas in their humility. One who wishes to lead the people must, in conduct, place oneself behind them—putting others first and oneself last.\n\nThus the sage, though above the people, is not a burden to them. Though ahead of the people, they are not a harm to them. Therefore the world delights in exalting them without wearying. Because they do not contend, no one in the world can contend with them.\n\n**The Three Treasures (Chapter 67)**\n\nThe world all says my Dao is great, yet it seems unrefined. Precisely because it is great, it appears unrefined—had it been refined, it would long since have been petty. Those who are discerning and clever have long been thus: their loftiness and self-regard, their exacting governance, have endured for ages. How trivial they are!\n\nI possess three treasures, which I hold and preserve:\nThe first is compassion,\nthe second is frugality,\nthe third is not daring to be first in the world.\n\nCompassion makes one courageous,\nfrugality makes one expansive,\nand not daring to be first in the world makes one the vessel of the world.\n\nCompassion—thus one can be brave.\nFrugality—thus one can be generous.\nNot daring to be first—thus one can become the leader of the world.\n\nThus one becomes the vessel of leadership. To become the vessel of leadership is to be a person of the Dao. I am able to be the leader of those who attain the Dao.\n\nNow, if one abandons compassion and yet seeks courage,\nif the people of this age forsake benevolence and pursue only martial valor;\nif one abandons frugality and yet seeks expansiveness,\nif they forsake restraint and pursue only extravagance;\nif one abandons deference and yet seeks precedence,\nif they forsake putting others first and strive only to be first—\nthis is death! Such conduct leads straight to destruction.\n\nFor with compassion, one triumphs in battle and stands firm in defense.\nWith benevolence, the people draw near and unite in purpose—thus one prevails in war and holds fast in defense.\nHeaven will save them, shielding them with compassion.\nWhen Heaven aids the virtuous, it bestows the nature of compassion, enabling them to protect themselves.\n\n**Matching Heaven (Chapter 68)**\n\nThe true warrior is not martial,\nfor they value virtue and power over brute force.\nThe true strategist is not wrathful,\nfor one who wages war with the Dao restrains evil in the heart and severs calamity before it sprouts, needing no cause for anger.\nThe true victor does not contend,\nfor one who conquers with the Dao draws near with benevolence and summons the distant with virtue, never clashing with the enemy yet bringing them to submission.\nThe true leader humbles themselves before others,\nfor one who skillfully employs others always maintains a posture of modesty and deference.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nfor to place oneself below others is the power of not contending.\nThis is called harnessing the strength of others,\nfor to humble oneself is to employ the force of those who serve.\nThis is called matching Heaven, the ultimate principle of antiquity,\nfor one who embodies this aligns their virtue with Heaven—this is the supreme Dao of the ancients.\n\n**Mysterious Application (Chapter 69)**\n\nThere is a saying in warfare:\nLaozi detested the wars of his time, so he framed this teaching in his own voice.\n\"I dare not act as the host but rather as the guest,\"\nfor the host initiates, and I dare not strike first.\nThe guest responds without provocation—\none should act only in accord with Heaven.\n\"I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot,\"\nfor invading another’s land and seizing their wealth is advancement,\nwhile closing the gates and defending the city is retreat.\nThis is called marching without formation,\nfor when the enemy persists in plunder, becoming a scourge upon the world, even in punishing them, one does so without order.\nRaising arms without arms,\nfor though one may rage, it is as if no arm can be raised.\nGrasping without weapons,\nfor though one may seize, it is as if no enemy remains to be seized,\nwielding no blade.\nWhy? To spare the people from suffering under a ruler who defies the Dao, enduring the agony of loss.\nNo calamity is greater than underestimating the enemy,\nfor the greatest harm in warfare comes from belittling the foe, ceaselessly encroaching, waging war with greed.\nTo underestimate the enemy is to nearly forfeit my treasure—\n\"nearly\" means drawing close, and \"treasure\" refers to one’s life.\nTo belittle the enemy is to court the loss of one’s own being.\nThus when opposing armies clash,\nthe side that grieves will prevail,\nfor grief is compassion, and soldiers do not shrink from death.\n\n**Knowing Difficulty (Chapter 70)**\n\nMy words are exceedingly easy to know, exceedingly easy to practice.\nLaozi says: My teachings are concise and easy to understand, simple and easy to follow.\nYet none in the world can know them, none can practice them,\nfor people despise softness and favor rigidity.\nMy words have a source, my affairs have a lord.\nMy teachings stem from a fundamental origin, and my deeds follow a proper order. If people do not understand, it is not due to any failing in my virtue—it is their hearts that oppose mine.\nOnly through ignorance do they not know me.\nOnly because the people are ignorant is my virtue obscured, unseen externally, profound and subtle—hence their lack of understanding.\nThose who know me are few, and thus I am esteemed.\n\"Few\" means rare. Only those who grasp the Dao can truly know me, and so I am held in high regard.\nTherefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within,\nfor the coarse cloth is humble outwardly, while the jade represents inner richness—concealing treasure, hiding virtue, never displaying it to others.\n\n**Knowing Illness (Chapter 71)**\n\nTo know yet seem not to know is supreme,\nfor to recognize the Dao yet speak as if ignorant is the height of virtue.\nNot to know yet claim to know is illness.\nTo be ignorant of the Dao yet assert knowledge is a flaw in virtue.\nOnly by recognizing this illness as illness does one avoid illness.\nOnly by perceiving the affliction of others’ forced knowing can one avoid such affliction oneself.\nThe sage is free from illness because they recognize illness as illness—thus they remain free from illness.\nThe sage suffers no such affliction of forced knowing, for they constantly lament that others bear this illness, rejecting such folly—hence they do not afflict themselves.\nThe sage embraces penetrating wisdom yet appears ignorant,\nwishing to guide the world toward simplicity, loyalty, and integrity, each preserving their pure nature.\nThe petty person, not grasping the Dao’s intent, recklessly engages in forced knowing to display brilliance, inwardly depleting their spirit, shortening their years.\n\n**Cherishing the Self (Chapter 72)**\n\nWhen the people do not fear authority, great authority will descend.\n\"Authority\" means harm. If people do not fear minor harm, major harm will come—\nand the greatest harm is death.\nThose who fear it should cherish their spirit, aligning with Heaven and Earth.\nDo not encroach upon your dwelling,\nfor the heart dwells in the spirit—it should be spacious and gentle, not cramped and harsh.\nDo not weary your source of life,\nfor life arises from the spirit. Entrust yourself to emptiness, delight in stillness, regulate your diet, dismiss thoughts of desire and beauty, and banish perversity from your heart—these erode the root and exhaust the spirit.\nOnly one who does not weary the spirit will not be wearied,\nfor only one who never exhausts their spirit—purifying the heart, washing away filth, embracing tranquility and desirelessness—will find the spirit dwelling within, unwearied.\nThus the sage knows themselves but does not display themselves,\nunderstanding their own gains and losses yet never parading their virtue outwardly, concealing it within.\n\nThe self-loving do not exalt themselves.\nTo love oneself is to preserve one’s essence and qi, not to seek lofty renown in the world.\nThus, abandon that and embrace this—\nabandon self-display and self-exaltation, embrace self-knowledge and self-love.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Three**\nTo be bold in daring is to court death;\nboldness in reckless action brings destruction to the self.\nTo be bold in restraint is to preserve life;\nboldness in restraint brings life to the self.\nThese two—\ndaring and restraint—\nbring either benefit or harm:\npreserving life is benefit, destroying it is harm.\nWhat Heaven abhors—\nit abhors reckless action.\nWho knows the reason?\nWho can fathom Heaven’s intent and not transgress?\nThus even the sage finds this difficult.\nIf the sage’s luminous virtue still struggles with reckless boldness,\nhow much more so for those lacking such virtue?\n\nThe Dao of Heaven does not contend yet excels in victory;\nHeaven does not vie with humanity over honor or disgrace, yet people naturally revere it.\nIt does not speak yet excels in response;\nHeaven does not speak, yet the myriad things move in accord with the seasons.\nIt does not summon yet things come of themselves;\nHeaven does not call, yet all things turn toward the sun, bearing yin within.\nVast and unhurried, it excels in planning.\nVast and expansive, Heaven’s Dao, though boundless, skillfully governs human affairs—\nrewarding good and punishing evil, each receiving its due.\nHeaven’s net is vast and wide,\nloose yet never failing.\nThough its mesh is broad, it oversees the good and evil of all, missing nothing.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Four**\nWhen the people do not fear death,\nhow can death be used to frighten them?\nWhen rulers impose cruel punishments, leaving the people with no means to live,\nthey cease to fear death.\nThose who cultivate the self, indulging in desires that harm the spirit or coveting wealth that destroys the body,\ndo not know what to fear.\nWhy then threaten them with death?\nIf rulers do not relax their harsh laws and teach the people to abandon passions and desires,\nhow can they use death to intimidate?\nIf the people were made to constantly fear death,\none should first remove the causes of oppression and instruct them to forsake greed.\nYet those who act perversely,\nwe seize and execute—\nwho would dare?\nIf, after teaching the Dao, the people still disobey and instead engage in strange and cunning acts,\nthen by royal law they are seized and killed—who would dare transgress?\nLaozi laments that the rulers of his time did not first employ moral transformation but instead resorted to punishment.\n\nThere is always one who oversees killing—\nthis overseer is Heaven, which from on high observes human transgressions.\nHeaven’s net is vast and wide,\nloose yet never failing.\nTo take the place of this overseer\nis like a clumsy man trying to wield the master carpenter’s adze.\nHeaven’s Dao is supremely clear, its oversight of killing constant—\nlike the cycles of spring growth, summer flourishing, autumn harvest, and winter storage,\nor the turning of the Dipper’s handle, all governed by measure.\nIf a ruler seeks to usurp this role,\nit is as if an unskilled laborer tried to replace the master carpenter—\ntoiling in vain.\nFor one who takes the place of the master carpenter,\nrarely do they avoid injuring their own hands.\nIf a ruler enacts punishments,\nit is like the clumsy man wielding the adze—\nthe square and circle are never true,\nand harm returns to the wielder.\nThose who usurp Heaven’s role in killing\nlose the proper order,\nand in failing to uphold it, bring calamity upon themselves.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Five**\nThe people’s hunger\nstems from their rulers consuming too much in taxes—\nthis is why they starve.\nThe people suffer cold and hunger because their rulers exact excessive taxes,\nleading them to emulate such greed, rebel against the Dao, and violate virtue.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern\nbecause their rulers are meddlesome—\nthis is why they are difficult to govern.\nThe people become unruly because their rulers are full of desires and fond of action,\nso the people follow suit, their deceit and falsity making them hard to rule.\n\nThe people treat death lightly\nbecause their rulers pursue life too lavishly—\nseeking excessive gain, they endanger themselves.\nThus they court death.\nFor those who do not make life their sole pursuit\nare wiser than those who prize it.\nOnly those who do not make life their primary concern—\nwhose minds are untouched by rank and emolument,\nwhose bodies remain free of wealth and profit,\nwhom neither the Son of Heaven can enslave nor the feudal lords command—\nare wiser than those who cling to life.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Six**\nIn life, humans are supple and weak,\nfor they embody harmonious qi and embrace the spirit—\nthus they are soft and yielding.\nIn death, they become rigid and strong,\nfor their harmonious qi is exhausted and their spirit departed—\nthus they are hard and stiff.\n\nThe myriad things and plants in life are tender and fragile,\nfor their harmonious qi remains.\nIn death, they wither and dry,\nfor their harmonious qi has gone.\nThus the rigid and strong belong to death,\nthe soft and weak belong to life.\nFrom these two observations,\nwe know that the rigid and strong lead to death,\nwhile the soft and weak lead to life.\n\nTherefore, when armies are strong, they do not prevail;\nmighty armies, eager for battle and fond of slaughter, spread poison and breed resentment—\nthe weak unite against the strong, so they do not win.\nWhen trees are strong, they are felled.\nA robust trunk invites branches and leaves to grow upon it.\nThe strong and great occupy the lowly place,\nwhile the soft and weak rise above.\nIn the workings of creation, great trees lie below,\nwhile smaller things ascend—\nHeaven’s Dao humbles the strong and uplifts the weak, a natural principle.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seven**\nThe Dao of Heaven—\nis it not like the drawing of a bow?\nHeaven’s Dao is obscure, so we use familiar things as metaphors.\nThe high is pressed down, the low is lifted,\nthe excessive is reduced, the deficient is replenished.\nThis is how the bow is tuned to be serviceable—\npressing down the high, lifting the low,\ndiminishing the strong, and aiding the weak—\nsuch is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven reduces the excessive to supplement the deficient.\nHeaven’s Dao diminishes the full to benefit the humble,\nalways valuing harmony and balance.\nThe Dao of humanity is not so—\nit diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\nHuman ways reverse Heaven’s Dao:\nthe world’s people take from the poor to enrich the wealthy,\nseizing from the weak to strengthen the powerful.\nWho can have abundance and offer it to the world?\nOnly those who follow the Dao.\n\nWho can occupy a position of abundance and, reflecting on their rank and emoluments, offer them to the world’s deficient? Only a ruler who follows the Dao can do so. Thus the sage acts without claiming credit, bestows virtue without expecting repayment. Their work is accomplished, yet they do not dwell in its achievement. Having completed their task, they do not cling to their position. They do not wish their worthiness to be seen, concealing their merit and refusing honor, for they fear Heaven’s reduction of the excessive.\n\n**Chapter 78**\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nyet in a round vessel it becomes round, in a square vessel square;\ndammed, it stops; released, it flows.\nYet nothing can surpass it in overcoming the hard and strong—\nwater can wear away mountains and flood hills,\ngrind iron and dissolve bronze,\nachieving what nothing else can.\nFor there is nothing that can replace it.\nNothing can replace water in overcoming the hard and strong.\nThe weak overcomes the strong—\nwater extinguishes fire, yin dissolves yang.\nThe soft overcomes the hard—\nthe tongue is soft, the teeth are hard, yet the teeth perish before the tongue.\nAll in the world know this:\nthat the soft and weak endure, while the hard and strong break.\nYet none can put it into practice—\nashamed of humility, they prefer arrogance and force.\nThus the sage declares:\nTo humble oneself is to serve.\nTo bear the nation’s disgrace is to be lord of the altars of soil and grain—\na ruler who can endure the nation’s filth, like rivers and seas receiving every stream, will long preserve their state and become its sovereign.\nTo bear the nation’s misfortune is to be king of all under Heaven—\na ruler who takes blame upon themselves and bears calamity in place of the people may rule the world.\nStraight words seem reversed—\nthese are words of truth, yet the world does not understand and takes them as perverse.\n\n**Chapter 79**\nTo reconcile great resentment,\none who kills is put to death, one who injures is punished—this is mutual requital.\nYet resentment will remain,\nfor legal punishment fails to address human feeling, and lingering bitterness may fall upon the innocent.\nHow can this be called good?\nIf one acts thus, they oppose Heaven’s heart—how can this reconcile resentment as good?\nThus the sage holds the left tally and does not demand from others.\nIn ancient times, the sage held the left tally, matching tokens as a pledge.\nWithout written laws, they carved tallies to serve as trust,\nrelying on the tally alone, not imposing other demands.\nThe virtuous oversee the tally—\na ruler of virtue examines only the tally’s agreement.\nThe unvirtuous oversee transgressions—\na ruler without virtue betrays their pledge and scrutinizes others’ faults.\nHeaven’s Dao is impartial, yet it always favors the good.\nHeaven’s Dao has no partiality, but it aligns with the good—just as one who oversees the tally does.\n\n**Chapter 80**\nA small state with few people...\n\nThough the sage governs a great state, they regard it as small, practicing frugality and restraint without extravagance. Though the people are many, they treat them as few, never daring to burden them. They ensure the people possess tools for ten or a hundred households yet do not employ them—meaning the implements of farmers—so as not to conscript or deprive them of their proper seasons. They cause the people to value life and not wander far. When the ruler works for the people’s benefit and removes their harms, each finds their place, and the people cherish life and cling to their homes. When government decrees are not onerous, the people remain content in their occupations and do not migrate far from their accustomed dwellings.\n\nThough there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them. Through clarity and non-action, they do not indulge in extravagance or delight in travel and amusement. Though there are armor and weapons, they have no occasion to array them, for there is no resentment or enmity in the world. They cause the people to return to knotting cords for record-keeping, casting aside ornament to return to simplicity, so that trust is without deceit.\n\nThey find their food sweet—content with coarse fare, not plundering the people’s livelihood. They find their clothing fine—pleased with plain garments, not prizing the five colors. They find their dwellings secure—at ease in thatched huts, not admiring ornate houses. They delight in their customs—rejoicing in their unadorned ways, never altering them. Neighboring states gaze upon one another, the sounds of their chickens and dogs heard across the distance, yet the people grow old and die without ever traveling between them, for they have no restless desires.\n\n**Chapter 81**\nTruthful words are not beautiful—\ntruth is as it is, unadorned and plain.\nBeautiful words are not truthful—\nfine speech is embellished rhetoric, hollow and false.\n\nThe good do not argue—\nthe good cultivate the Dao and do not adorn themselves with ornament.\nThose who argue are not good—\nclever speech brings disaster upon the tongue.\n\nA mountain holds jade, yet men dig into the mountain;\na river holds pearls, yet men muddy its depths—\nglib tongues and many words bring ruin to the self.\n\nThe wise are not broadly learned—\nthe wise are those who know the Dao, guarding the One and the origin.\nThe broadly learned are not wise—\nthose with vast knowledge lose the essential and the true.\n\nThe sage does not accumulate—\nthe sage accumulates virtue, not wealth, using virtue to teach the foolish and wealth to aid the poor.\nHaving acted for others, they themselves possess more—\nhaving extended virtue and transformation to others, their own virtue grows.\nHaving given to others, they themselves have more—\nhaving distributed wealth and goods to others, their own wealth increases like the light of the sun and moon, never exhausted.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm—\nHeaven gives life to the ten thousand things, nurturing and raising them, never causing injury.\nThe Dao of the sage acts and does not contend—\nthe sage follows Heaven’s example in their deeds, bringing affairs to completion without competing for merit or fame, thus preserving their sagely work in full.",

      "translated_text": "**Laozi’s *Daodejing* with Commentary by Heshang Gong**\n**Chapter 1: Embracing the Dao (Title of the Section)**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken of—\nRefers to the Dao of classical learning, governance, and moral instruction.\nIs not the eternal Dao.\nIt is not the Dao of natural generation and growth.\nThe eternal Dao should be nurtured through non-action to preserve the spirit, through non-interference to pacify the people, by concealing one’s brilliance, erasing traces, and hiding origins—it cannot be named.\n\nThe name that can be named—\nRefers to wealth, honor, nobility, and fame that surpass the world.\nIs not the eternal name.\nIt is not the name that naturally endures.\nThe eternal name should be like an infant who has not yet spoken, an egg that has not yet divided, a luminous pearl within an oyster, or fine jade embedded in stone—internally radiant, yet outwardly appearing dull and unrefined.\n\nNameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nThe nameless refers to the Dao. The Dao is formless, hence it cannot be named.\n\"Beginning\" means the root of the Dao, which exhales qi and spreads transformation, emerging from emptiness and non-being to become the origin of Heaven and Earth.\n\nNamed, it is the mother of the myriad things.\nThe named refers to Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth possess form and position, yin and yang, softness and hardness—this is why they are named.\n\"Mother of the myriad things\" means Heaven and Earth contain qi to generate the myriad things, nurturing them to maturity, like a mother raising her child.\n\nThus, by constantly being without desire, one may observe its subtleties.\n\"Subtleties\" means essentials. If one can constantly be without desire, one may observe the essentials of the Dao—the essential being the One.\nThe One emerges to bestow names upon the Dao, praising and clarifying right and wrong.\n\nBy constantly having desire, one may observe its manifestations.\n\"Manifestations\" means returns. Those who constantly have desires may observe what worldly customs return to and pursue.\n\nThese two emerge from the same source but have different names.\nThe two refer to having desire and being without desire.\n\"Emerge from the same source\" means they both arise from the human heart.\n\"Different names\" means their designations differ.\nThe name of being without desire endures, while the name of having desire leads to self-destruction.\n\nBoth are called profound.\n\"Profound\" means Heaven. It means those with desires and those without both receive qi from Heaven.\n\nProfound within the profound—\nWithin Heaven, there is yet another Heaven.\nThe endowment of qi varies in thickness; those who obtain harmony and nourishing essence give birth to the worthy and sagely, while those who receive disorder and defilement give birth to the greedy and licentious.\n\nIt is the gate of the myriad subtleties.\nTo enter the Heaven within Heaven, where the endowment of qi varies in thickness, one must eliminate emotions and desires to preserve harmony—this is called the gateway to knowing the essentials of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter 2: Nurturing Life**\n\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nThey exalt their own beauty, making it manifest.\nThis is already ugliness.\nIt leads to danger and ruin.\nWhen all know goodness as goodness,\nIt brings merit and fame.\nThis is already not goodness.\nIt is what people contend over.\n\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other.\nSeeing being, one acts as non-being.\nDifficulty and ease complete each other.\nSeeing difficulty, one acts as ease.\nLong and short define each other.\nSeeing short, one acts as long.\nHigh and low incline toward each other.\nSeeing high, one acts as low.\nSound and voice harmonize with each other.\nThe superior sings, and the inferior must harmonize.\nFront and back follow each other.\nThe superior acts, and the inferior must follow.\n\nTherefore, the sage engages in non-action,\nGoverning through the Dao.\nAnd practices the teaching without words,\nInstructing through personal example.\nThe myriad things arise,\nEach moving on its own,\nYet do not refuse.\nThey do not reject or resist.\nThey are born but do not possess.\nThe primordial qi generates the myriad things but does not possess them.\nThey act but do not rely on it.\nThe Dao enacts its works but does not rely on them, expecting no reward.\nTheir work is accomplished, yet they do not dwell in it.\nWhen tasks are completed and affairs settled, they withdraw and do not occupy their position.\nOnly because they do not dwell in it,\nThus, they do not depart.\nVirtue and fortune remain constant, never leaving their person.\n\nThis means one should not follow what is not practiced, nor know what is not spoken with urgency.\nThe six lines above—high and low, long and short—when the ruler opens one source, a hundred streams arise below. The variations of these hundred streams lead to unrest without end.\n\n**Chapter 3: Pacifying the People**\n\nDo not exalt the worthy—\nThe \"worthy\" refer to the worthy of世俗, those skilled in eloquence and literary refinement, who depart from the Dao to exercise power, abandoning substance for ornament.\n\"Not exalting\" means not valuing them with emoluments or offices.\nSo that the people do not contend.\nThey will not contend for merit and fame, returning to naturalness.\n\nDo not value goods that are hard to obtain—\nThis means the ruler does not indulge in rare treasures, casting gold aside in the mountains and discarding pearls and jade into the depths.\nSo that the people do not become thieves.\nWhen the superior’s transformation is pure and tranquil, there are no greedy people below.\n\nDo not display what is desirable—\nBanish lewd music and keep beautiful people at a distance.\nSo that the people’s hearts are not confused.\nThey will not engage in licentiousness or be led into disorder.\n\nTherefore, in the sage’s governance—\nThis explains that the sage’s governance of the state is the same as self-cultivation.\nEmpty their hearts—\nEliminate cravings and remove chaotic distractions.\nFill their bellies—\nEmbrace the Dao and hold fast to the One, guarding the five spirits.\nWeaken their ambitions—\nBe gentle, yielding, and modest, not occupying positions of power.\nStrengthen their bones—\nCherish essence and value its application, filling the marrow and strengthening the bones.\n\nConstantly cause the people to be without knowledge and without desire.\nReturn to simplicity and preserve purity.\nSo that those with cunning dare not act.\nTheir thoughts are deep, and they do not speak lightly.\nAct through non-action—\nDo not contrive; move in accordance with natural principles.\nThen nothing will be ungoverned.\nVirtue flourishes, and the people are at peace.\n\n**Chapter 4: The Fathomless Source**\n\nThe Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\n\"Empty\" means the center. The Dao conceals its name and hides its reputation; its use lies in the center.\nIt is constantly not full.\n\"Constantly\" means always. The Dao is always humble and never full.\nAbysmal, it seems to be the ancestor of the myriad things.\nThe Dao is profound and unknowable, seemingly the ancestral origin of the myriad things.\n\nBlunt its sharpness—\n\"Sharpness\" means advancement. When people desire to advance their essence to seek merit and fame, they should be restrained, following the Dao’s example of not displaying itself.\nUntangle its knots—\n\"Knots\" mean entangled resentments. One should contemplate the Dao’s non-action to resolve them.\nSoften its brilliance—",

If one can nourish the spirit, it will not die.\n\"Spirit\" refers to the spirits of the five viscera: the liver stores the *hun*, the lungs store the *po*, the heart stores the *shen*, the kidneys store essence, and the spleen stores the will. If all five viscera are harmed, the five spirits depart.\n\nThis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe undying resides in the Mysterious Female.\n\"Mysterious\" is Heaven; in humans, it is the nose.\n\"Female\" is Earth; in humans, it is the mouth.\nHeaven feeds humans with the five qi, entering through the nose to lodge in the heart. The five qi are subtle and refined, becoming essence, spirit, acuity, brightness, and the five voices.\nIts ghost is called the *hun*; the *hun* is yang, governing entry and exit through the human nose, communicating with Heaven—thus the nose is called \"Mysterious.\"\nEarth feeds humans with the five flavors, entering through the mouth to lodge in the stomach.

      "translated_text": "\"Noble\" means to fear. \"If\" means to arrive. It means great trouble arrives at the body, thus both alarm. What is meant by favor and disgrace? This asks what favor is and what disgrace is. Favor is honor and glory; disgrace is shame and humiliation. The phrase \"arriving at the self and questioning it\" is to enlighten others. Disgrace is lowly—(alternatively, \"favor is high, disgrace is low\")—disgrace is base and vile. To gain them is alarming: gaining favor and glory is alarming, for standing in high position is like treading deep peril. The noble dare not be arrogant; the wealthy dare not be extravagant. To lose them is alarming: losing means falling from favor into disgrace. Alarming means fearing calamity will strike again. This is what is meant by \"favor and disgrace both bring alarm.\" This explains the earlier \"gaining them is alarming, losing them is alarming.\"\n\nWhat is meant by \"regard great trouble as the self\"? Again, questioning: why fear great trouble arriving at the self? The reason I have great trouble is that I have a self. The reason I have great trouble is that I have a self. Having a self brings worry—laboring over hunger and cold, indulging emotions and desires, thus encountering misfortune. If I had no self, what trouble would I have? If I had no body, attaining the Dao naturally, lightly ascending clouds, moving freely without obstruction, communing with the Dao as spirit—what trouble could there be? Thus one who values the self for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world. This means that a ruler who values his own body and belittles others, desiring to be lord of the world, may be temporarily established but cannot endure. One who cherishes the self for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world. This means that a ruler who cherishes his own body not for himself but to be a parent to the myriad people—such a one, becoming lord of the world, may be entrusted with his body above the people, enduring without fault.\n\n**Chapter 14: Praising the Mysterious**\n\nLooked at but unseen, it is called \"even\"—\nWithout color, it is \"even.\" It means the One has no hue and cannot be seen by looking.\nListened to but unheard, it is called \"rare\"—\nWithout sound, it is \"rare.\" It means the One has no tone and cannot be heard by listening.\nGrasped but unattainable, it is called \"subtle\"—\nWithout form, it is \"subtle.\" It means the One has no body and cannot be held by seizing.\n\nThese three cannot be exhaustively questioned—\nThe three refer to \"even,\" \"rare,\" and \"subtle.\" They cannot be exhaustively questioned because, being without color, sound, or form, they cannot be spoken by the mouth, transmitted by writing, but must be received in stillness, sought with spirit, and cannot be obtained by questioning.\n\nThus they merge into the One.\n\"Merge\" means to unite.

It refers to those who covet power and fame, who seek achievement and glory—such people cannot long stand firm in body or walk the Way.\n\n\"Those who stride do not walk\"—\nThose who consider themselves noble and stride above others will be collectively obstructed by the people, preventing them from moving forward.\n\n\"Those who display themselves are not enlightened\"—\nPeople who display their own appearance as fine, who regard their own conduct as conforming to the Way, do not realize how ugly their form is, how base their conduct.\n\n\"Those who are self-righteous are not illustrious\"—\nThose who consider themselves right and others wrong will be collectively obstructed by the people, preventing their brilliance from shining forth.\n\n\"Those who boast of themselves achieve no merit\"—\nThose who constantly boast and claim merit for themselves lose the merit they might have gained from others.\n\n\"Those who are self-conceited do not endure\"—\nThose who are fond of self-aggrandizement cannot long endure.\n\nIn relation to the Way, these are called \"leftover food and parasitic conduct.\"\n\"Parasitic\" means greedy. If such self-aggrandizing and boastful people were in the Way of governing a state, they would daily levy taxes to amass surplus provisions, engaging in greedy conduct.\n\nAll things may detest them—\nWhen such people hold office, their every action seeks to harm, so there is nothing that does not fear and detest them.\n\nThus, those who possess the Way do not remain.\nThis means that those who possess the Way do not dwell in such a state.\n\n**Image of the Origin (Chapter 25)**\nThere is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth.\nIt refers to the formless Dao, which in its undifferentiated state gives rise to the myriad things, existing before heaven and earth.\n\nSilent and empty, it stands alone and does not change—\n\"Silent\" means without sound. \"Empty\" means without form. \"Stands alone\" means without peer. \"Does not change\" means its transformations are constant.\n\nIt travels everywhere without exhaustion—\nThe Dao circulates through heaven and earth, penetrating all things. In the yang it does not scorch, in the yin it does not rot. It passes through all without peril or weariness.\n\nIt may be called the Mother of all under heaven—\nThe Dao nurtures the essential qi of the myriad things, like a mother nurturing her child.\n\nI do not know its name; I style it \"Dao\"—\nI do not see the Dao’s form, nor know how to name it. Seeing that all things arise from the Dao, I style it \"Dao.\"\n\nForcing a name upon it, I call it \"Great\"—\nNot knowing its name, I forcefully call it \"Great,\" for it is lofty without superior, all-encompassing without boundary, embracing all things—thus I call it \"Great.\"\n\n\"Great\" means \"it goes\"—\nIts greatness is not like heaven, which is always above, nor like earth, which is always below. Rather, it departs, having no fixed abode.\n\n\"It goes\" means \"it is distant\"—\n\"Distant\" means it reaches the limitless, spreading its qi through heaven and earth, penetrating all without obstruction.\n\n\"Distant\" means \"it returns\"—\nThough distant, it does not sever its connection, but returns to dwell within the human body.\n\nThus, the Dao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and the king (or \"the human\") is also great—\nThe Dao is great because it encompasses heaven and earth, containing all things. Heaven is great because it covers all without exception. Earth is great because it bears all without exception. The king is great because he governs all without exception.\n\nWithin the realm, there are four great things—\nThe four great things are the Dao, heaven, earth, and the king.\n\nYet any designation or name falls short of its ultimate reality—\nTo speak of the Dao is to speak of what it arises from; having arisen, it is then called the Dao. Yet this \"greatness\" within names is not as great as namelessness. The nameless cannot be captured by names—this is the realm.\n\nHeaven, earth, and the king all reside within this nameless realm. Thus it is said, \"Within the realm, there are four great things.\"\n\nAnd the king occupies one of them—\nWithin the eight directions, there are four great things, and the king occupies one of them.\n\nHumans model themselves on earth—\nHumans should model themselves on earth’s tranquility and gentle harmony. Planting yields the five grains; digging yields sweet springs. It labors without complaint, achieves without claiming credit.\n\nEarth models itself on heaven—\nHeaven is serene and unmoving, bestowing without seeking repayment, nurturing the myriad things without taking possession.\n\nHeaven models itself on the Dao—\nThe Dao is clear and still, silently circulating its essential qi, allowing the myriad things to form of themselves.\n\nThe Dao models itself on the natural—\nThe nature of the Dao is spontaneous, without anything it models itself upon.\n\n**Valuing Power (Chapter 26)**\nHeaviness is the root of lightness—\nIf a ruler is not heavy, he will not be revered. If one does not value heaviness in cultivating the self, one loses one’s spirit. The flowers and leaves of plants are light, so they wither and fall; their roots are heavy, so they endure.\n\nStillness is the lord of restlessness—\nIf a ruler is not still, he loses his authority. If one does not value stillness in cultivating the self, one’s life is imperiled. The dragon is still, so it can transform; the tiger is restless, so it suffers early loss.\n\nThus, the sage travels all day yet does not depart from the heavy and still—\n\"Still\" refers to tranquility. The sage travels the Way all day yet does not depart from stillness and heaviness.\n\nThough there be splendid sights, he dwells in them with transcendent ease—\n\"Splendid sights\" refer to palaces and towers. \"Dwells in them\" refers to the residences of consorts and concubines. \"Transcendent ease\" means keeping a distance and not residing in them.\n\nHow could the lord of ten thousand chariots—\n\"How could\" is an expression of lament for the rulers of the age. The \"lord of ten thousand chariots\" refers to the king.\n\nTreat his person as light beneath all under heaven?\nThe king is most revered, yet how could he conduct himself with frivolity and restlessness? This laments how the rulers of the age indulge in extravagance and reckless dissipation.\n\nLightness loses the ministers—\nIf a ruler is frivolous and dissolute, he loses his ministers. If one is frivolous and dissolute in cultivating the self, one loses one’s essence.\n\nRestlessness loses the lord—\nIf a ruler acts with haste and impatience, he loses his throne. If one is hasty and impatient in cultivating the self, one loses one’s spirit.\n\n**Skillful Application (Chapter 27)**\n\"In good traveling, there are no wheel tracks—\"",

      "translated_text": "One who skillfully practices the Dao seeks it within the self, never descending the hall nor stepping beyond the gate—thus leaving no wheel tracks. Skillful speech bears no flaw or blame, for one who chooses words with care speaks without blemish or fault under heaven. Skillful calculation requires no counting rods, for one who reckons affairs by the Dao abides in unity without deviation; when calculations are few, they may be known without counting rods. Skillful closure needs no bolt or bar, yet cannot be opened, for one who seals desires and guards the spirit by the Dao does not rely on doors or bolts that may be undone. Skillful binding uses no cords or knots, yet cannot be untied, for one who binds affairs by the Dao binds the heart in such a way that no cord may loose it.\n\nThus the sage constantly excels at saving people—by teaching loyalty and filial piety, desiring to preserve their nature and lives—so that none are cast aside, and noble and base each find their place. The sage constantly excels at saving things—by teaching the people to follow the four seasons, desiring to preserve all things from harm—so that nothing is cast aside. The sage does not despise the worthless nor prize jade, regarding them as one. This is called \"inheriting the light.\" The sage’s skill in saving people and things is called inheriting the luminous Dao.\n\nTherefore, the good serve as teachers to the not-good; those who practice goodness are taken by the sage as models for others. The not-good serve as resources for the good, for even those who act without goodness are taught and guided by the sage to become useful. If one does not value one’s teacher, one lacks support; if one does not cherish one’s resources, one has nothing to employ. Though one may deem oneself wise, this is great delusion. This is called the essential mystery.\n\n**Returning to Simplicity (Chapter 28)**\nKnow the masculine, yet guard the feminine, and become the valley of the world. The masculine symbolizes honor; the feminine, humility. Though one may know one’s own honor and distinction, one should still guard humility, abandoning the strength of the masculine for the softness of the feminine. Thus the world turns to one as water flows into a deep valley. As the valley of the world, one’s constant virtue never departs, and one returns to the state of an infant—clumsy and without knowledge.\n\nKnow the bright, yet guard the dark, and become the model for the world. The bright symbolizes clarity; the dark, obscurity. Though one may know one’s own clarity, one should still guard obscurity, as if dim and seeing nothing. Thus one may become the model for the world, and one’s constant virtue remains unerring. As the model for the world, one’s constant virtue never falters, and one returns to the boundless. When virtue never falters, life endures and returns to the infinite.\n\nKnow glory, yet guard disgrace, and become the valley of the world. Glory symbolizes honor; disgrace, defilement. One who knows one’s own glory should still guard defilement. Thus the world turns to one as water flows into a deep valley. As the valley of the world, one’s constant virtue is fulfilled—for \"fulfilled\" means \"settled.\" One who becomes the valley of the world finds virtue ever settled within. One returns to simplicity. When simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels; vessels are for use. When the simplicity of the myriad things scatters, it becomes implements. When the Dao scatters, it becomes spirit and illumination, flowing as the sun and moon, dividing into the five phases. When the sage employs it, it becomes the leader of officials. Thus great governance does not sever. When the sage employs it, the great Dao governs the world without harm, and in cultivating the self, it governs desires without injuring the spirit.\n\n**Non-Action (Chapter 29)**\nThose who would take the world and act upon it—I see they will not succeed. The world is a sacred vessel; it cannot be acted upon (or: cannot be grasped). Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it.\n\nThus things may go ahead or follow behind, may exhale warmly or blow cold, may be strong or weak, may be secure or imperiled. Therefore the sage discards excess, extravagance, and extravagance. By abandoning these three, dwelling in harmony, and practicing non-action, the world transforms of itself.\n\n**Frugality and Restraint in Warfare (Chapter 30)**\nOne who assists a ruler with the Dao does not use arms to strengthen the world.

      "translated_text": "**After Great Armies (Continuation of Chapter 30)**\nIn the wake of great armies, there must be years of famine. Heaven responds with malign qi, harming the five grains and injuring all people. The good warrior achieves results and stops—merely resolute, not glorying in it. He does not dare seize strength through force. He is resolute but not boastful, resolute but not vaunting, resolute but not arrogant. Resolute action arises only from necessity, not coercion. Resolute but not overbearing. All things, when they reach their prime, begin to age—grass and trees flourish to their peak, then wither and fall; men grow strong to their height, then decline. To say that strength can endure is called \"not the Dao.\" Withering and aging come from failing to follow the Dao. Those who do not follow the Dao perish early.\n\n**Against Arms (Chapter 31)**\nFine weaponry is an instrument of ill omen. \"Fine\" means adornment; \"omen\" means good. Arms disturb the spirit and muddy harmonious qi—an implement not good for men, not to be embellished. All things may despise it, for when arms move, they bring harm. Thus one who embodies the Dao does not dwell in such a state.\n\nThe noble person at rest values the left; in warfare, he values the right. This shows that the way of arms is the opposite of the noble person’s way, and what they value differs. Arms are instruments of ill omen, implements of harm. They are not the noble person’s instruments, not what he esteems. Only when unavoidable does he employ them—when facing decline, disorder, or calamity, wishing to shield the myriad people, he uses them to defend himself. Serenity is supreme. He does not covet lands or profit from others’ wealth. Though victorious, he does not celebrate it, for to celebrate victory is to delight in killing. One who delights in killing cannot fulfill his will in the world. A ruler who takes pleasure in killing cannot be entrusted with dominion over all under heaven, for as a lord of men, he would wield power over life and death, wantonly meting out punishments and executions.\n\nIn auspicious affairs, the left is honored; in inauspicious affairs, the right. The deputy general stands on the left, the supreme general on the right. The deputy general, though humble, occupies the yang position because he does not hold sole authority over killing. The supreme general, though exalted, occupies the yin position because he alone commands slaughter. This is to treat it as mourning rites. The supreme general stands on the right, for mourning rites honor the right, and the dead are valued in yin. When the slain are many, mourn them with sorrow and tears, for one’s virtue is too meager to transform others through the Dao, and the harm falls upon the innocent. When victorious, observe it with mourning rites. In ancient times, after victory, the general took the position of the chief mourner, wearing plain robes and weeping—showing that the noble person values virtue and disdains arms, that he does not rejoice in punishing the inauspicious, that his heart finds no joy in it, likening it to mourning. He grieves for the unending wars of later generations.\n\n**The Unnamable Virtue (Chapter 32)**\nThe Dao is eternally nameless.",

This illustrates how lords and kings do not claim honorific titles for themselves, and thus attain true nobility.\n\nDo not desire to gleam like jade or clatter like stone.\n*Gleaming* suggests rarity, *clattering* suggests abundance; jade is rare and thus prized, stone is plentiful and thus despised. This means one should not seek to be valued like jade or scorned like stone, but rather abide in the mean.\n\n**Chapter Forty: Reversal**\nReversal is the movement of the Dao.\n*Reversal* means returning to the root. The root is the source of the Dao’s movement, from which all things arise; to turn away from it is to perish.\nWeakness is the function of the Dao.\nSoftness and weakness are what the Dao constantly employs, and thus it endures forever.\n\nAll things under heaven are born from Being,\nAll things arise from Heaven and Earth, which possess form and position—thus they are said to be born from Being.\nBeing is born from Nonbeing.\nThe numinous radiance of Heaven and Earth, the fluttering of insects and wriggling of creatures—all emerge from the Dao. The Dao has no form, thus it is said to be born from Nonbeing.\nThis speaks of the root prevailing over the flower, weakness prevailing over strength, and humility prevailing over fullness.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: Sameness and Difference**\nWhen the highest scholar hears the Dao, they diligently practice it.\nThe highest scholar, upon hearing the Dao, exerts themselves strenuously to put it into practice.\nWhen the middling scholar hears the Dao, they hold it as if it exists, as if it does not.\nThe middling scholar, upon hearing the Dao, cultivates themselves to attain longevity and governs the state to achieve great peace, embracing it joyfully. Yet when they retreat and encounter wealth, beauty, or honor, they are deluded by desire and lose it again.\nWhen the lowest scholar hears the Dao, they laugh loudly at it.\nThe lowest scholar, greedy and full of desires, sees the Dao’s softness and calls it cowardice; sees its plainness and calls it vulgar. Thus, they laugh at it.\nIf it is not laughed at, it would not be worthy of being called the Dao.\nIf it were not scorned by the lowest scholar, it would not deserve the name of Dao.\n\nThus, established sayings declare:\n*Established* means set forth. These sayings illustrate how one with the Dao should be, as in the following lines.\nThe Dao that is bright appears dim;\nOne who embodies the luminous Dao seems obscure, as if lacking perception.\nThe Dao that advances appears to retreat;\nOne who pursues the Dao seems to fall behind.\nThe Dao that is level appears uneven.\n*Level* means even. One who embodies the great Dao does not distinguish themselves but seems to blend with the multitude.\nThe highest virtue resembles a valley;\nOne of the highest virtue resembles a deep valley, unashamed of filth and impurity.\nThe purest white appears sullied;\nOne of the greatest purity seems tainted, not seeking to display themselves.\nThe most expansive virtue appears insufficient;\nOne whose virtue is vast seems dull and inadequate.\nEstablished virtue appears deficient;\nOne who cultivates virtue seems as if they could be depleted.\nUnadorned truth appears tarnished;\nOne of unadorned truth seems as if their colors have faded and lost their brilliance.\nThe greatest square has no corners;\nOne of perfect integrity has no rigid edges.\nThe greatest vessel is slow to complete;\nOne of great capacity, like the Nine Tripods or ritual vessels, cannot be swiftly forged.\nThe greatest sound is scarcely heard;\nThe greatest sound, like thunder waiting for the right moment to strike, illustrates how one should cherish qi and minimize speech.\nThe greatest image has no form;\nOne who embodies the great image is plain and without adornment.\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless.\nThe Dao is concealed, leaving no one able to name it.\nOnly the Dao is good at bestowing and completing.\n*Completing* means bringing to fruition. The Dao excels at endowing people with essence and qi, and bringing them to fulfillment.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: Transformation of the Dao**\nThe Dao gives birth to the One,\nThe Dao causes what it generates to be unified.\nThe One gives birth to the Two,\nThe One gives rise to yin and yang.\nThe Two gives birth to the Three,\nYin and yang generate the harmonious, clear, and turbid qi, dividing into Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.\nThe Three give birth to the myriad things.\nHeaven, Earth, and Humanity together generate the myriad things. Heaven bestows, Earth transforms, and Humanity nurtures them.\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nAll things bear yin and face yang, turning their hearts toward the sun.\nAnd blend their qi to attain harmony.\nAll things contain primordial qi, which enables their softness and harmony—like the chest containing organs, bones containing marrow, and plants having hollows through which qi flows, allowing them to endure.\n\nWhat people despise are \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"unworthy,\" yet kings and lords use these as their titles.\n*Orphaned*, *widowed*, and *unworthy* are inauspicious names, yet kings and lords adopt them to embody humility, modeling themselves on emptiness, softness, and harmony.\nThus, some things are diminished yet augmented,\nWhen pulled, they cannot be drawn away; when pushed, they inevitably return.\nOthers are augmented yet diminished.\nThose who seek to elevate themselves will collapse; those who covet wealth will invite disaster.\n\nWhat people teach,\nThis refers to the common teaching of abandoning weakness for strength, and softness for rigidity.\nI also teach them.\nI teach people to abandon strength for weakness, and rigidity for softness.\nThe strong and violent do not meet a natural death.\nThe *strong and violent* are those who disbelieve in the profound and mysterious, rebel against the Dao and virtue, disregard scriptural teachings, and rely on power and force.\n*Do not meet a natural death* means being cut off by Heaven’s decree, slain by weapons, or executed by royal law—dying without the fulfillment of their allotted lifespan.\nI will take this as the father of my teaching.\n*Father* means origin. Laozi uses the example of the strong and violent as the starting point for admonition.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: Partial Use**\nThe softest under heaven gallops through the hardest under heaven.\nThe softest is water; the hardest is metal and stone. Water can penetrate the firm and enter the rigid, flowing without obstruction.\nThat which has no substance enters where there is no gap.\n*That which has no substance* refers to the Dao. The Dao has no form or substance, thus it can enter where there are no gaps, communicating with the numinous and aiding all beings.\nThus, I know the benefit of non-action.\nI see how the Dao, through non-action, allows the myriad things to transform and complete themselves—thus I know the benefit of non-action for humanity.\nTeaching without words,\nFollowing the Dao’s example of not speaking, one teaches through embodiment.",

When fullness reaches its extreme, cold arrives, and cold brings withering and death. This teaches that one should not be rigid or restless.\n\nStillness overcomes heat. In autumn and winter, the myriad things rest in the yellow springs below. When stillness reaches its extreme, heat arises—heat is the source of life. Clarity and stillness can rectify all under heaven. If one can be clear and still, one becomes the enduring ruler of all under heaven. Maintaining integrity ensures no end.\n\n**Chapter 46: Restraining Desires**\nWhen all under heaven follows the Dao,\nthis means the ruler embodies the Dao.\nHorses are retired to fertilize the fields.\n*Fertilize* means to enrich the fields. Those who govern the state cease using weapons and chariots, returning horses to cultivate the land. Those who cultivate the self return yang essence to nourish their bodies.\n\nWhen all under heaven abandons the Dao,\nthis means the ruler has lost the Dao.\nWarhorses breed on the outskirts.\nWarfare never ceases, and warhorses are born on the borders, never to return.\n\nNo sin is greater than indulging desire.\nThis refers to excessive lust.\nNo disaster is greater than not knowing contentment.\nWealth and nobility cannot restrain themselves.\nNo fault is greater than covetousness.\nCoveting others’ possessions is both greedy and grasping.\n\nThus, the contentment of knowing contentment\nmeans guarding the root of truth.\nIs always content.\nIt means having no desire.\n\n**Chapter 47: Mirroring the Distant**\nWithout leaving the household, one knows all under heaven.\nThe sage knows all under heaven without leaving the household by understanding others through oneself and other families through one’s own. Thus, all under heaven is seen.\n\nWithout peering through the window, one perceives the Dao of heaven.\nThe Dao of heaven and the Dao of humanity are one; heaven and humanity are interconnected, their qi flowing as one. When the ruler is clear and still, the qi of heaven naturally aligns. When the ruler is full of desires, the qi of heaven becomes turbid. Fortune and misfortune, benefit and harm—all arise from oneself.\n\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nThis means leaving one’s home to observe others’ homes, departing from oneself to observe others. The farther one observes, the less one truly sees.\n\nThus, the sage knows without traveling,\nthe sage, without ascending to heaven or descending into the abyss, understands all under heaven through the heart.\nNames without seeing.\nWhen superiors favor the Dao, inferiors favor virtue; when superiors favor martial prowess, inferiors favor brute force. The sage infers the great from the small, perceives the external by examining the internal.\nAccomplishes without acting.\nWhen superiors do nothing, inferiors follow suit, households are provided for, and the people are content. The myriad things transform of their own accord.\n\n**Chapter 48: Forgetting Knowledge**\nPursuing learning leads to daily increase.\n*Learning* refers to the study of governance, teachings, rituals, and music. *Daily increase* means that emotions, desires, and embellishments grow more abundant each day.\n\nPursuing the Dao leads to daily diminishment.\n*Dao* refers to the Dao of nature. *Daily diminishment* means that emotions, desires, and embellishments gradually fade away.\n\nDiminish and further diminish,\n*Diminish* means reducing desires. *Further diminish* means gradually eliminating them.\nuntil one reaches non-action.\nOne should be as serene and uncontrived as an infant.\nThen there is nothing that is not done.\nWhen desires are severed and virtue merges with the Dao, there is nothing that cannot be applied, nothing that cannot be accomplished.\n\nGoverning all under heaven always relies on non-action.\n*Governing* means to rule. To rule all under heaven, one must rely on non-action, not on toil and disturbance.\nWhen one engages in action, it is insufficient to govern all under heaven.\nWhen one favors action, governance becomes burdensome, the people are unsettled, and thus it is insufficient to rule all under heaven.\n\n**Chapter 49: Entrusting Virtue**\nThe sage has no constant mind.\nThe sage values change and continuity, prizing compliance as if having no mind of his own.\nHe takes the minds of the people as his mind.\nThe sage follows what is convenient for the people’s minds.\n\nThe good, I treat as good.\nWhen the people act virtuously, the sage treats them as good.\nThe not-good, I also treat as good.\nThough some among the people may not be good, the sage transforms them to be good.\nThus, virtue is goodness.\nWhen the people are morally transformed, the sage deems them good.\n\nThe trustworthy, I trust.\nWhen the people are trustworthy, the sage trusts them.\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust.\nWhen the people are untrustworthy, the sage transforms them to be trustworthy.\nThus, virtue is trust.\nWhen the people are morally transformed, the sage deems them trustworthy.\n\nThe sage in all under heaven is cautious and reverent,\nthe sage in all under heaven is always cautious and fearful, never arrogant or extravagant in wealth and nobility.\nand blends his mind for all under heaven.\nThis means the sage’s mind for all under heaven is as if muddled, appearing ignorant and unenlightened.\n\nThe people all fix their ears and eyes upon him.\n*Fix* means to employ.

For those who cultivate life, rhinoceroses and tigers have no means to harm them, and blades have no way to strike them.\n\nWhy is this?\nThis asks why rhinoceroses, tigers, and weapons do not harm them.\nBecause they do not enter the realm of death.\nBecause they do not transgress the thirteen realms of death.\nIt is said that the spirit’s luminous protection guards them, so these things dare not harm them.\n\n**Cultivating Virtue Fifty-First**\nThe Dao gives them life.\nThe Dao gives life to the ten thousand things.\nVirtue nurtures them.\nVirtue is the One.

Having known the Dao, one should also know the One.\nHaving known the child, one again guards the mother.\nHaving known the One, one should again guard the Dao and return to non-action.\nThus, one’s body does not perish.\nOne remains free from danger.\n\nSeal its apertures,\nThe apertures are the eyes. Let the eyes not recklessly see.\nClose its gates,\nThe gates are the mouth. Let the mouth not recklessly speak.\nAnd one’s life will not be exhausted.\nIf one seals the eyes from reckless seeing and closes the mouth from reckless speech, one’s life will not be worn out.\nOpen its apertures,\nOpen the eyes to desires.\nAnd further its affairs,\nFurther the affairs of desire.\nAnd one’s life will be beyond saving.\nDisaster and chaos will arise.\n\nSeeing the small is called clarity,\nThe first stirrings of misfortune, before harm appears, are small; to perceive them alone is clarity.\nGuarding the soft is called strength.\nTo guard softness is to grow daily in strength.\nUse its light,\nUse the light of the eyes to observe the world’s advantages and harms.\nAnd return to its clarity.\nReturn the light inward, lest the spirit leak away.\nDo not leave the body to calamity,\nInward vision preserves the spirit, preventing loss.\nThis is called practicing the eternal.\nTo practice this is to cultivate the constant Dao.\n\n**Adding Evidence Fifty-Third**\nIf I were suddenly granted knowledge, I would walk the great Dao.\n*Jie* means great. Laozi laments that the rulers of his time do not walk the great Dao, so he speaks thus: If I were suddenly granted knowledge of governance, I would walk the great Dao, personally practicing the transformation of non-action.\nOnly action is to be feared.\nOnly to act is to be feared, lest one lose the Dao’s intent.\nDesiring to reward goodness, one fears false goodness will arise;\nDesiring to trust loyalty, one fears false loyalty will appear.\nThe great Dao is level,\nLevel means smooth and easy.\nYet the people prefer byways.\nByways are crooked and not upright.

I am able to be the leader of those who attain the Dao.\n\nNow, if one abandons compassion and yet seeks courage,\nif the people of this age forsake benevolence and pursue only martial valor;\nif one abandons frugality and yet seeks expansiveness,\nif they forsake restraint and pursue only extravagance;\nif one abandons deference and yet seeks precedence,\nif they forsake putting others first and strive only to be first—\nthis is death! Such conduct leads straight to destruction.\n\nFor with compassion, one triumphs in battle and stands firm in defense.\nWith benevolence, the people draw near and unite in purpose—thus one prevails in war and holds fast in defense.\nHeaven will save them, shielding them with compassion.\nWhen Heaven aids the virtuous, it bestows the nature of compassion, enabling them to protect themselves.\n\n**Matching Heaven (Chapter 68)**\n\nThe true warrior is not martial,\nfor they value virtue and power over brute force.\nThe true strategist is not wrathful,\nfor one who wages war with the Dao restrains evil in the heart and severs calamity before it sprouts, needing no cause for anger.\nThe true victor does not contend,\nfor one who conquers with the Dao draws near with benevolence and summons the distant with virtue, never clashing with the enemy yet bringing them to submission.\nThe true leader humbles themselves before others,\nfor one who skillfully employs others always maintains a posture of modesty and deference.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nfor to place oneself below others is the power of not contending.\nThis is called harnessing the strength of others,\nfor to humble oneself is to employ the force of those who serve.\nThis is called matching Heaven, the ultimate principle of antiquity,\nfor one who embodies this aligns their virtue with Heaven—this is the supreme Dao of the ancients.\n\n**Mysterious Application (Chapter 69)**\n\nThere is a saying in warfare:\nLaozi detested the wars of his time, so he framed this teaching in his own voice.\n\"I dare not act as the host but rather as the guest,\"\nfor the host initiates, and I dare not strike first.\nThe guest responds without provocation—\none should act only in accord with Heaven.\n\"I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot,\"\nfor invading another’s land and seizing their wealth is advancement,\nwhile closing the gates and defending the city is retreat.\nThis is called marching without formation,\nfor when the enemy persists in plunder, becoming a scourge upon the world, even in punishing them, one does so without order.\nRaising arms without arms,\nfor though one may rage, it is as if no arm can be raised.\nGrasping without weapons,\nfor though one may seize, it is as if no enemy remains to be seized,\nwielding no blade.\nWhy? To spare the people from suffering under a ruler who defies the Dao, enduring the agony of loss.\nNo calamity is greater than underestimating the enemy,\nfor the greatest harm in warfare comes from belittling the foe, ceaselessly encroaching, waging war with greed.\nTo underestimate the enemy is to nearly forfeit my treasure—\n\"nearly\" means drawing close, and \"treasure\" refers to one’s life.\nTo belittle the enemy is to court the loss of one’s own being.\nThus when opposing armies clash,\nthe side that grieves will prevail,\nfor grief is compassion, and soldiers do not shrink from death.\n\n**Knowing Difficulty (Chapter 70)**\n\nMy words are exceedingly easy to know, exceedingly easy to practice.\nLaozi says: My teachings are concise and easy to understand, simple and easy to follow.\nYet none in the world can know them, none can practice them,\nfor people despise softness and favor rigidity.\nMy words have a source, my affairs have a lord.\nMy teachings stem from a fundamental origin, and my deeds follow a proper order. If people do not understand, it is not due to any failing in my virtue—it is their hearts that oppose mine.\nOnly through ignorance do they not know me.\nOnly because the people are ignorant is my virtue obscured, unseen externally, profound and subtle—hence their lack of understanding.\nThose who know me are few, and thus I am esteemed.\n\"Few\" means rare. Only those who grasp the Dao can truly know me, and so I am held in high regard.\nTherefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within,\nfor the coarse cloth is humble outwardly, while the jade represents inner richness—concealing treasure, hiding virtue, never displaying it to others.\n\n**Knowing Illness (Chapter 71)**\n\nTo know yet seem not to know is supreme,\nfor to recognize the Dao yet speak as if ignorant is the height of virtue.\nNot to know yet claim to know is illness.\nTo be ignorant of the Dao yet assert knowledge is a flaw in virtue.\nOnly by recognizing this illness as illness does one avoid illness.\nOnly by perceiving the affliction of others’ forced knowing can one avoid such affliction oneself.\nThe sage is free from illness because they recognize illness as illness—thus they remain free from illness.\nThe sage suffers no such affliction of forced knowing, for they constantly lament that others bear this illness, rejecting such folly—hence they do not afflict themselves.\nThe sage embraces penetrating wisdom yet appears ignorant,\nwishing to guide the world toward simplicity, loyalty, and integrity, each preserving their pure nature.\nThe petty person, not grasping the Dao’s intent, recklessly engages in forced knowing to display brilliance, inwardly depleting their spirit, shortening their years.\n\n**Cherishing the Self (Chapter 72)**\n\nWhen the people do not fear authority, great authority will descend.\n\"Authority\" means harm. If people do not fear minor harm, major harm will come—\nand the greatest harm is death.\nThose who fear it should cherish their spirit, aligning with Heaven and Earth.\nDo not encroach upon your dwelling,\nfor the heart dwells in the spirit—it should be spacious and gentle, not cramped and harsh.\nDo not weary your source of life,\nfor life arises from the spirit. Entrust yourself to emptiness, delight in stillness, regulate your diet, dismiss thoughts of desire and beauty, and banish perversity from your heart—these erode the root and exhaust the spirit.\nOnly one who does not weary the spirit will not be wearied,\nfor only one who never exhausts their spirit—purifying the heart, washing away filth, embracing tranquility and desirelessness—will find the spirit dwelling within, unwearied.\nThus the sage knows themselves but does not display themselves,\nunderstanding their own gains and losses yet never parading their virtue outwardly, concealing it within.",

      "translated_text": "Though the sage governs a great state, they regard it as small, practicing frugality and restraint without extravagance. Though the people are many, they treat them as few, never daring to burden them. They ensure the people possess tools for ten or a hundred households yet do not employ them—meaning the implements of farmers—so as not to conscript or deprive them of their proper seasons. They cause the people to value life and not wander far. When the ruler works for the people’s benefit and removes their harms, each finds their place, and the people cherish life and cling to their homes. When government decrees are not onerous, the people remain content in their occupations and do not migrate far from their accustomed dwellings.\n\nThough there are boats and carriages, they have no use for them. Through clarity and non-action, they do not indulge in extravagance or delight in travel and amusement. Though there are armor and weapons, they have no occasion to array them, for there is no resentment or enmity in the world. They cause the people to return to knotting cords for record-keeping, casting aside ornament to return to simplicity, so that trust is without deceit.\n\nThey find their food sweet—content with coarse fare, not plundering the people’s livelihood. They find their clothing fine—pleased with plain garments, not prizing the five colors. They find their dwellings secure—at ease in thatched huts, not admiring ornate houses. They delight in their customs—rejoicing in their unadorned ways, never altering them. Neighboring states gaze upon one another, the sounds of their chickens and dogs heard across the distance, yet the people grow old and die without ever traveling between them, for they have no restless desires.\n\n**Chapter 81**\nTruthful words are not beautiful—\ntruth is as it is, unadorned and plain.\nBeautiful words are not truthful—\nfine speech is embellished rhetoric, hollow and false.\n\nThe good do not argue—\nthe good cultivate the Dao and do not adorn themselves with ornament.\nThose who argue are not good—\nclever speech brings disaster upon the tongue.\n\nA mountain holds jade, yet men dig into the mountain;\na river holds pearls, yet men muddy its depths—\nglib tongues and many words bring ruin to the self.\n\nThe wise are not broadly learned—\nthe wise are those who know the Dao, guarding the One and the origin.\nThe broadly learned are not wise—\nthose with vast knowledge lose the essential and the true.\n\nThe sage does not accumulate—\nthe sage accumulates virtue, not wealth, using virtue to teach the foolish and wealth to aid the poor.\nHaving acted for others, they themselves possess more—\nhaving extended virtue and transformation to others, their own virtue grows.\nHaving given to others, they themselves have more—\nhaving distributed wealth and goods to others, their own wealth increases like the light of the sun and moon, never exhausted.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm—\nHeaven gives life to the ten thousand things, nurturing and raising them, never causing injury.\nThe Dao of the sage acts and does not contend—\nthe sage follows Heaven’s example in their deeds, bringing affairs to completion without competing for merit or fame, thus preserving their sagely work in full.",
